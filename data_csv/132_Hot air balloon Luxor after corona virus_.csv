What are the necessary precautions to make the hot air balloon in Luxor Egypt after covid19?
"I have not read or heard of how balloon flights are going to be operated when they are resumed after the corona virus. The operators may be forced to reduce the number of folk they can take on a flight and have everyone wear a mask. The baskets a fairly small and not designed for social distancing. Once Egypt opens up again to tourists I am sure some one will share how it went for them.Edited: 10:40 am, June 14, 2020 "

There’s no chance of distancing from strangers in the balloons. But after covid could be a couple of years away so I wouldn’t worry about it now.
