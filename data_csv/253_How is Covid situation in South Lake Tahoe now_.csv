We spend a week in Tahoe every year but this year is obviously different. We are from Southern California if it makes a difference. What is open / closed in Lake Tahoe? Any restrictions in place? Do restaurants offer takeouts only?
Here is an article from the SF Chronicle:https:/…Tahoe-Coronavirus-travel-15413861.phpThere is a possibility that Tahoe (California side) could be put on the watch list anytime. Then all bets are off. Not a good time to be traveling to this area.
The Tahoe Basin is quite probably going to get the entire El Dorado County thrown on the watchlist. Tourists have spread the virus to residents in increasing numbers.Please stay away until this is over.
"We were in Tahoe the week of the Fourth. We avoided SLT due to the crowds we saw driving up from LA. We stayed on the north shore in Incline Village. The Hyatt had hand sanitizer stations all over the property. When we went down to their private beach they had the lounge chairs 6 ft or more apart. The attendant sprayed them off and we got clean beach towels from the kiosk. Most restaurants had outside dining or we did take out. No problem. We went parasailing, hiked, horseback riding or rode bikes."
Covid isn’t being created naturally in Tahoe. It’s being brought in from areas that have large numbers of infected people. Which in CA is SoCal and the Bay Area. Be kind to a rural area with limited medical resources and visit NEXT year.
Are beaches open? Pope beach in particular
"Again, PLEASE listen to my and Madalines advice. We are a rural area with limited health facilities. We don't need tourists from hotspots bringing in the virus from their areas. We have just one major hospital in El Dorado County. Pope Beach is in South Tahoe (El Dorado County)It doesn't matter if it's open or closed, it's dangerous for us. Please try and understand.Edited: 7:13 pm, July 17, 2020 "
"Incline Village is on the Nevada side, so rules may be different. The virus, however, does not recognize state boundaries."
"What’s up with censorship on this forum? Why the innocent question if Pope Beach is open was deleted? I also see a lot of deleted responses on other posts. I have been a member of this forum for many years and it always been very helpful. What have happened?Edited: 10:11 pm, July 17, 2020 "
I have no idea about the deleted post but I think you should be able to glean from responses that no one is recommending travel from LA (especially) to Tahoe.
"Also not sure why your post was deleted. Also, you should take heed in why we are not in favor of traveling to Tahoe from L.A.You might want to consider other reasons for not traveling up to my County. We had a wetter than usual Spring and we have been inundated with hugh armies of bedbugs and red ants which have infested all hotels and motels.There have been many reports of man eating trout in Lake Tahoe. Also we have experienced mountain lions that are roaming free and are extremely hungry. Skunks are multiplying at unprecidented rates and if that isn't bad enough there are 10000 times more bears than we ever have had in the forest.If you still want to come please be aware of the TICKS which are now outnumbering the killer hornets. Please bring enough bug spray to stay safe.(I think a little levity is needed in these times)"
