I have searched everywhere and cannot find an answer. If travelling to Spain for a holiday against FCO advice would you still be entitled to use the EHIC card. For example if you fall and break your foot etc. If so can someone post an official link on this. Many thanks.
"Here is a link. https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp…Until 31 Dec this year you can use your EHIC. But, please remember that healthcare staff are already overloaded and may not speak any English. While urgent treatment will be covered, the cost of medication will not be. If serious, you may well have to make your own arrangements for food and personal care in hospital. Obviously, repatriation costs, missing your flight home need to be considered. The healthcare system in Spain was brilliant before covid, now it is on its knees."
"So many people are unaware of just how limited the EHIC coverage is - all it does is entitle you to basic initial healthcare under the same terms as the population of the country you are in. If you break your foot you would get an x-ray and it set in plaster, then chucked out of the door. No support to get back to your own country, no flight change costs, no continuing care (you’re expected to return to your country of origin) etc.Do be aware that the level of Covid cases in Andalucía is now 66 per 100,000 - not far off local lockdown levels in the UK - and rising rapidly. At Your Own Risk."
Thank you. I did find that but it doesn't mention if you are in Spain against the FCO advice if you are still covered. I know most travel insurance policies are void if we fly at the moment but wasn't sure if EHIC would also be void given the fact that we are advised not to go to Spain for non essential travel if that makes sense. I assume that as it doesn't mention it as an exclusion that it would still be valid.
"The FCO advice on travel insurance (which, interestingly, uses a fall in Spain as an example of the dangers of relying solely on the EHIC!) doesn’t state that the EHIC is invalidated by FCO travel advice: https:/…foreign-travel-insurance"
Yes NoSoy I cannot find anywhere that states it would be invalid either. We are not due to go until October but doesn't look like we will be going at the moment. Was just googling all the important things but came across a stumbling block on this one.
"Hi June, it is a European health scheme and is not affected by an individual member state’s advice on travel. Basically the costs for treatment you receive in a member state is billed back to the NHS. It will no longer be applicable at the end of the transition period on 31 December as the UK is no longer a member of the EU."
"The EHIC isn’t restricted to EU member states though, and Sánchez has already stated he’s minded to do a bilateral reciprocal on emergency healthcare if UK membership of EHIC doesn’t continue into 2022 and beyond. One of many things still under negotiation.7,550 new cases in España yesterday - don’t be expecting much to change anytime soon, October looking less and less likely I’m afraid (I had early October pencilled in but probably not now).Edited: 12:15 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"Simón is on TV speaking right now. This is his explanation for the jump in figures:“ Almost 3,000 new cases of COVID-19 in Spain in the last 24 hours : Health reports 2,935 diagnoses of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours and adds 7,550 confirmed backward cases , raising the total number to 337,334. In addition, the Ministry adds 26 new deaths , bringing the total number of people killed with coronavirus to 28,605.”"
If you are 59 or under you can get travel insurance from www.battleface.com even if travelling against FCO advice. They will even cover you when visiting war zones etc
the simple answer is yes you can still use your card!
