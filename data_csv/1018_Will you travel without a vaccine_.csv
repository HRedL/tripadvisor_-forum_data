"I won't, will you?"
"We are struggling with the same thoughts. Our next planned trip is/was Europe in August.....we always go to northern Italy which, of course, was the hot spot for the world coronavirus secondary outbreak.At this point we are resigned to not going, as we would have to have medical insurance and a reasonable expectation of either an effective vaccine or effective therapeutic treatment for covid19, none of which are likely. Similarly, our winter Huatulco trip seems just as unlikely at this time if we are being realistic. Life without travel kind of sucks."
Important to be aware that a vaccine for COVID-19 is not certain to occur. Other measures may be in place to allow for safe travel.
"Yes, I will. I acknowledge the risk and severity of Covid,. But the same time I balance that reality with the statistical probability of infection or death, and weigh it against other mortality risks that exist in our world...and I decide that life is too short to not live it based on that fear. Not going to be cavalier about it, but neither am I willing to live as a sequestered person."
"The old saying is ""Never say never!"", but at this point our plan is to not travel until there is a vaccine. We are both near 70 with underlying conditions, and it just does not make sense to take the risk. I'm thinking January is the most optimistic earliest date. It is possible that this coming winter will be a write off for travel. It will be interesting to see if one could even get medical travel insurance without a vaccine.The death rate in Mexico due to COVID is still climbing and has no signs of slowing down any time soon.https://tinyurl.com/ydhhglcwEdited: 10:00 am, May 08, 2020 "
"Can we stay on track here on this forum, which is to provide info and advice in regards to Huatulco and surrounding area? There must be general info forums which this type of conversation should be steered towards."
"I’m not sure what the problem is with this thread.....one can simply choose to not read or take part. Travel is why this forum exists and this thread clearly refers to travel.Regardless, the big issue which has repercussions beyond covid is travel medical insurance. Anyone who has dealt with *any* insurance claims of any type should know that the insurance companies will do whatever it takes to exclude whatever they can. It is not a great leap to envision not having any insurance available at all and, if it is available, the list of exclusions will cover almost everything. Insurance companies are extremely skilled at linking almost anything and everything when denying a claim.That will be the biggest factor to us."
"I agree kelownatraveller, insurance is key. Teddy, I don't spend time on any ""general info forums"" so this was my first option for opinions from others (most of whom I respect), if it doesn't suit you, c'est la vie!"
"One thing that may make me change my mind about traveling would be the availability of an accurate and recognized immunity test. There does not seem to be one now, but if it becomes available both myself and my wife will try to get a test. We traveled last to Huatulco on January 6-20. Within two days of returning we both got a very nasty ""cold"". We thought that due to the timing of it, it would be impossible for it to be COVID. At that time there were no confirmed cases of it in Mexico or Canada. In the last few days there has now been a report that COVID existed in Europe earlier than was previously thought. Someone in France has now been retroactively diagnosed with COVID on December 27, 2019. Perhaps if it was in France, it may have been in Spain as well. There was a large wedding party at Las Brisas with many of them from Spain. We ate at the buffet at the same time as them a number of times. Buffets are a common way that COVID is spread. We now think we may very well have gotten COVID, and would now test positive to COVID immunity. If that were the case, then we would consider going back to Huatulco this winter pending package and insurance availability. With all the ""ifs"" involved that now seems highly unlikely, but I guess it is a faint hope."
"Ron, my sister in Colorado (a retired MD) was very sick in January and again in February, was never tested for COVID but has had 3 negative test results for COVID antibodies. She thought if she had had it she could donate convalescent plasma but no such luck.Wife and I were sick when we left home Jan 30 (got better after about 2-3 days of OAXACA heat!) and spent Feb 6-13 at Brisas, never felt sick after."
"We agree with LH!Sounds like some folks from the North may have forgotten their history (but the local folks here, have not!) A little more than 500 years ago when Europeans started coming to the New World, they brought diseases with them that wiped out nearly 90% of the indigenous population. Fast forward to a few weeks ago when the locals closed the airport for 2 days to protest and to stop tourists from landing in HUX, and then stopped ambulances from bringing infected folks from Huatulco into the Pochutla Hospital to avoid transmissions into Pochutla, and still we have police “filters” who stop and return cars of tourists to their original points of origin.Please remember your histories and stay home until there is a viable vaccine. Why would you want to infect the people of Huatulco? We have few of the health services that are available where you live. Just saying.....CHEdited: 1:17 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"Right on CH!!The end of stay-at-home orders doesn't mean the pandemic is over - it means they currently have room in the ICU for you!Edited: 1:25 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"Mike, just curious, how many deaths from Spanish flu, Sars, H1N1 or even the long time pest, dengue in the past 3-4 months? You're comparing apples to orangutans!"
"Without getting into an argument here, a viable vaccine is not a sure thing and thus cannot be counted on as the sole way to allow travel to Huatulco to resume. However, it is certainly correct that people should not be travelling to places like Huatulco until other measures to guarantee safety for all are in place. It's interesting (and concerning to me) how much Cancun and the Riviera Maya are trying to get things going as early as June 1! This will impact all of Mexico and not just that region. Huatulco is being much responsible and realistic."
"Mike, ~61,00 deaths - WITH vaccines AND effective treatments AND built-up immunitiy over many generations for most types. The same can NOT be said for COVID-19.Sorry, facts matter too."
"Well there were all those people travelling around the world in a few hours back in 1917 right? I was referring to something that WAS (a hundred years ago) and something that is here NOW. Do whatever you want,. Really."
"Really? I was referring to your mention of the (seasonal) flu deaths, and I was asking how many deaths from the afflictions you mentioned (Dengue, etc) in the previous 3-4 months (as in: compared to COVID-19) sorry I lost you! I 'm trying to put forward constructive discussion, being dismissive doesn't make you any smarter or more of a man, if you want to be dismissive then obviously you don't have the ability to comprehend the subject, have a nice weekend!"
"gotta agree with lh, ch, kt. travelin w/out endangerin me and others don’t make any sense. mikey spins some dream that don’t include the safety of locals. like he don’t give a hoot. sad"
"This is a loaded question with many ways to look at it. We have spent a couple of weeks in Mexico,in Oct-Nov for our anniversary and Dias de Los Muertos , 3+ weeks in January and a couple of weeks late Feb into March, since our kids started college 7 years ago, before that were coming down annually ,with kids 10 years prior,on the Carribean side until 2017 when we discovered Huatulco. We love Mexico and the Mexican people. If Huatulco stays locked down as they have been, it seems the area is doing great as far as keeping down the spread compared to most of the rest of the world and Mexico in general, we would't think of coming.I don't know if it is realistic to think Huatulco,or anywhere else, can remained shut down indefinitely ,or until their is a vaccine that may or may not happen. Lets face it,people will starve if thats the case. Huatulco is a couple of busloads of tourists from Oaxaca or Mexico City away from the virus spreading locally,I hope that doesn't happen but hunger is a great motivator. If it turns out,unknown at this point, that once we've been exposed to the virus,we produce antibodies and can't be reinfected, we will be able to travel,and work and shop again,because everybody ,other than the very wealthy ,is going to be exposed. Many people around the world are going to run out of $ and food long before their is a vaccine . ""Im depressing myself so I'll stop here,I know I didn't answer the question"
"We don’t think people will starve, Dave: the fisherman have continued to fish and are selling their catch, the farmers are continuing to grow crops and selling their products at the markets, and both are giving their extras to the food pantries (there are many!) That said, many people are without jobs because the hotels and non-essential stores and travel services are closed, and the restaurants are only providing take-out and delivery, but in addition to the food pantries, the government is providing supports as are folks-of-means to those who need help....and by the way, you folks up North who have the means, please consider donating to the local pantries!From what we have seen (folks at risk staying at home, others wearing masks, social distancing, etc) as well as the civil actions mentioned in our previous post, we believe that the folks here would rather keep their families healthy and alive even if they need to be slightly poorer at least until a viable vaccine or some medications proven to be helpful are available.CHEdited: 5:38 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"I’ll travel again when two conditions are met. One the destination is open for tourists and two it seems reasonably safe to so.I know some believe that in the fall we will have a vaccine and it will be widely available. Others believe we may never have a vaccine and about everything in between. The glorious orange leader tells us all will be right in the fall. Perhaps, even a broken clock is right twice a day."
"Mike, I'm thinking of others as well, not only about myself, that's all. Not so typical, I see."
"Hola CH,when I say people will starve I’m referring to the broad picture,not specifically Huatulco, I think Huatulco is doing much better than other areas not supported by the generosity of people who have fallen in love with the place and people. I‘ve been helping a friend there who lives up in the hills in a community that shares a well,its dry now and gets polluted when the rains start temporarily 1guess ,but they have tanks to get through the season that trucks come up to fill,if I was unable to help them they would not have water,the road gets washed out also in the big rainstorms,he works as a mate on fishing boats and many other jobs but no work at all now."
"The simple answer to this question is, not until the wine sales resume!!"
As per CH it would be great if people could help out by sending some dinero to Huatulco if they can. The Huatulco Food Bank has a Facebook site that has some easy instructions to provide a donation via etransfer. I was also able to track down a family who work at beach club that we like to go to and we were able to provide some help to them directly as well. There have been threads on Trip Advisor and Facebook as to different ways you can help out financially. I like your story Dave - great that you were able to make a difference in this manner.
We do what we canThank you
"Diablos, SI! I'll travel as soon as I can do so without submitting to quarantine on arrival, and without having to pass a (flaky) test before boarding.The pharma machine wants you to forget, there are *two* types of immunity. The first is your innate immune system, which - when healthy - can react to and knock out unknown invaders upon contact. It's how we managed to survive this far. You keep that system healthy through effective (but unpopular) measures like eating well, sleeping well, ...As a healthy person, I'm not worried about the virus at all. So as soon as governments get out of the way..."
"We take it that ViajeroP is not acquainted with the “cytokine storm“, a strong immune system response to the COVID-19 virus that does more harm to the body’s vital organs than the virus, itself? We cannot fathom why an intelligent person would want to spread the virus in Huatulco. Unless, maybe they do not really care about the local folks?In any case, today the US Embassy has provided the following guidance:“.....The number of confirmed and suspected cases is increasing daily in Mexico.  Hospital occupancy rates are also increasing, particularly in Mexico City, Baja California, Mexico State, and Quintana Roo.  Mexican health authorities have reiterated calls for people to stay home during this time.  The government deployed elements of the Mexican Armed Forces this week to the six states most affected by the virus to protect medical facilities and workers, as well as escort shipments of medical supplies......”“.....Essential activities include the provision of medical services and supplies, grocery delivery services, operation of grocery stores, restaurant delivery and carryout services, assurance of public safety, maintenance of fundamental economic functions and government social programs, and work in critical infrastructure.   Schools in Mexico are also closed.....” “....States and municipalities may implement additional closings and restrictions on public gatherings, transportation, business operations, and government operations.  Several states and municipalities have imposed curfews and movement restrictions on non-essential activities and have required citizens to wear masks when outside their homes.....”“.....In some areas, officials may issue fines and/or arrest and detain individuals found to be in violation of stay at home orders.....”“ ....Passengers and aircrew members arriving at and departing from Mexican airports may be subject to health screenings, including temperature checks.  Those exhibiting symptoms may be subject to additional health screenings and/or asked to quarantine voluntarily.....”“.....Mexican Tourism and Health officials instructed hotels to cancel new and existing reservations and close for non-essential business.  All accommodation services, including hotels, hostels, online platforms, and travel agencies, will cease receiving reservations and will reschedule all reservations.....”“.....Check with your airlines, cruise lines, or travel operators regarding any updated information about your travel plans and/or restrictions....”CH"
"Cytokine storm, ya ya, a healthy immune system is one that doesn't overreact like that. I don't remember the details, but a deficiency in something-or-other encourages that overreaction, a healthy diet keeps it in check. I'm too lazy to look up the details, sorry.Where did you get the idea I was willing to infect people? A strong immune system kills infection, doesn't just keep it barely under the surface.Like I said, I'll wait until the gov'ts get out of the way. Which, compared to other recent pandemics, means I'll be waiting until the real risk is LONG gone.Hard to be a contrarian around here...Edited: 10:35 pm, May 08, 2020 "

"My wife and i have annual coverage travel insurance, which we ""top up"" as we trips are often for more than the 30 day coverage our insurer provides in our policy, and as of March 13th they advised us that they were not covering Covid 19. Travel insurance is a must for us as you can empty your bank account rather quickly if you get sick or injured out of country. Stay safe. Bruce"
"Another good reason, Bruce, to change travel plans until a viable vaccine is available.Be safe, be well...CH"

"We cancelled our vacation to Huatulco days before the shut down began. We have credits for our condo and airfare and intend to use them in March 2021. I work in public health so I know all the data, have to hear it every second 247. Neither myself nor many of my colleagues are optimistic there will be an effective vaccine. We’ve never developed one yet for this type of virus and quite honestly, more people do die from influenza yet many still don’t get the flu shot. If I were older or had health conditions, that may give me more pause. However as long as both countries are open up travelers, I plan on traveling. People need to get used to living with this. It’s not going anywhere and quite frankly if testing were done at optimum levels, we would find there is definitely a lot of cases but the mortality rate is in actuality much lower. Everyone has been sold panic and fear which has made people irrational and scared. Not a good combination. We need to take measures to slowly ease back into normal life and at the same time make a more concentrated effort to protect our elderly."
"I will travel once Mexico has been reopened to (and welcomes) tourists, vaccine or not. Now simultaneously I do not want to spread anything to anyone else and especially to unaffected areas so I will keep that in mind......but I am not afraid for my own health. Stay healthy everyone.¡Diviertanse!"
"Hi 510. It may be more meaningful to folks to say that you know 90% (or even 95%) of the data than “all” of it. We were in public health for over 50 years and would never make such a claim.We also read the “Business Insider” article that provides the most of the same information that you have posted. But we don’t agree with it.While it is true that there have been no vaccines made available for the other corona viruses (for a number of reasons) there have been developments that may be useful for the novel version. We all will know more in the coming months.With regard to what you believe to know (or assume) about the COVID-19 death rates, that too will become more reliable in the coming months.All that said, yes, you are quite lucky to have your reservations re-scheduled for March 2021. Where will you be staying?Stay safe, be well....CHEdited: 10:41 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"In Canada, I do know that Manulife is covering you for covid 19 while traveling as long as there is no travel advisory to that destination at the time of travel.As for vaccines. I believe BC has stated that people from there cannot travel internationally until there is a vaccine. Ouch! I'm in Alberta, so hopefully they don't follow that policy. But I will wait to travel until things resume to some sort of normal. I'm thinking that will be a while."
It's only BC that has put out these restricitons. Just like NFLD has restrictions on who can enter NFLD from other provinces and Alberta doesn't. We definitely don't have that restriction in AB (at least not yet).
"HelloThere are 8 potential vaccines on the table. More than 100 in the line up out the door. To date nothing is proving completely 100% safe and 100% effective.Travel will not appear even “somewhat “ normal for at the “least” 36 months. And that only includes modern western nations.Traveling to Mexico for leisure, no one can estimate when it will be safe. Airlines have absolutely no set plan or agreed policies with homeland federal governments to ensure international passengers safety. Be safeRegardsEdited: 12:23 pm, May 11, 2020 "
"CasaHoffa, Figure of speech. Obviously no one knows everything. I just didn’t need to be lectured with more statistics. I get enough of that at work. I guess we will see about the vaccine but I stand by my statement. I’m not optimistic and will myself be carefully studying the trials before getting it for myself or family. Stay safe."
"Yes, 510, we understand your pessimism. However, we are more optimistic and given that we are from NYC, we have been getting some first-hand information from the doctors at NYU-Langone; our primary care physician for nearly 40 years is with that health system. Evidently, they are researching some of the treatments in the news and are beginning to have some success. As you are in the field, you may be interested in the work going on there. If not, that is your call.Stay safe, be well....CH"
I’ll go when they open up and there are no longer quarantines. And after our friends in Huatulco believe it is reasonably safe. I also work in the medical field and have to travel to different hospitals daily. Currently in a hotel room in a otherwise empty place.  Not going to be cavalier about this because we deal with the risks everyday. But a vaccine may be years away or never. Just be sensible and as safe as possible.
I second everything Rick said.
"I am optimistic there will be a vaccine, perhaps out of Canada or the UK. Seems like half the US Federal COVID team are in quarantine now!"

Will I? I really don't think it will be a choice. Most countries will want to see proof of some sort of vaccine.
"Does flying cause you any grief? I think once in Huatulco,one with precautions, be okay. It's the flight and layover in Mexico City airport that concern me. Any thoughts to help with flying?"
"We say if you’re suited up with the same PPE’s as the docs and nurses in the ventilator wards, and know how to take the stuff off without self contaminating, you’ll be fine.CH"
"If Mexico will allow me to enter, and my home country will allow me to come back, I will travel without the presence of a vaccine. Of course, if one becomes available I will get it, but as my years left on plant earth get fewer, I do not want to have my visits to paradise reduced anymore than absolutely necessary. Risk management."
"Yes, I would... on the condition that Mexico would allow me to enter without proof of vaccine- which I doubt would be available by a planned December trip. If I had to quarantine, according to CDN rules when I return - no probs, I can work from home if required. I have no intention of flying thru any current hotbed locales-naming anywhere USA or Mexico City. My biggest hurdle would be getting thru YVR ( Vancouver) going down and YYC ( Calgary) on return.. Now if only Westjet had direct flights from YYJ ( Victoria) I'd be made in the shade.. CDN , especially BC has been on top of this from the start... Thanks Dr. Bonnie Henry - seriously, Fluevog shoes made a pair in her honour! I'm an avid outside kinda gal.. I'd much rather practice social distancing in the sun, on the water, outdoor restaurants - than being in dreary, rainy Victoria."
"I absolutely will travel once the Mexican government gives an official ""open for tourism "" declaration and the locals support foreigners traveling to their home without protests and road blockades. ¡Diviertanse!"
"I was in Huatulco, in Devember, was scheduled to leave Sat. Dec. 28th. Normally I dont get sick, however the day after Christmas, I did get sick, it seemed like a bad cold, which stayed with me till I got home and did not go away for almost 3 weeks. I dont recall ever have a cold last that length of time. Just makes me wonder,"
That would be too soon for the Corona virus as Huatulco has had a very low amount of cases although all of Mexico suffers from inadequate testing.
