"When will this fee be repealed for timeshare owners? I own a 3/52nds deeded timeshare at the Elysian Beach Resort, I was just billed over $3,000 in maintenance fees for 2019. This is for my pro-rata share of insurance, taxes, repairs, utilities, etc for the Elysian. Now the government has imposed a daily fee of $25 for each day that I use my timeshare. Owners should be exempt from this fee as they are paying twice for services provided by the island. Guests or timeshare exchangers should be charged the fees but not the actual owners. That is how the Elysian handles the utility surcharge for guests. St. Thomas has beautiful beaches and water; however, I for one will not be paying an additional fee of $525 for three weeks for the ""privilege"" of visiting what many say St. Thomas to be is a ""garbage dump with palm trees"". Timeshare owners should boycott St. Thomas and visit Mexico or any of the other Caribbean islands until this unfair tax on owners is adjusted."
"I feel for you. This issue was debated when it was enacted and many share your feelings. Unfortunately it doesn’t look like it will be repealed. I wish I knew how to advise you. You pay $3000/yr for a timeshare you’re not going to use, and you will have to pay your yearly fee going forward. Selling a timeshare is very difficult if not impossible. Whatever you think is the best road to take, I wish you well."
"""... however, I for one will not be paying an additional fee of $525 for three weeks for the ""privilege"" of visiting what many say St. Thomas to be is a ""garbage dump with palm trees"".""I'm with Bill in empathizing with your plight (which, as he said, was discussed at length when the tax was first implemented) but I don't think the comparison of St Thomas to a garbage dump was at all necessary unless (although you carefully worded it to imply otherwise) this is your opinion of my home. In which case I would of course have to disagree with and take offence to such a silly statement.Personally I've just never really seen the point of timeshares since I was first approached about buying one back when dinosaurs ruled the earth. Their appeal seemed to die out for several years until a resurgence of promotion.In any event a lawsuit was filed against the Government of the Virgin Islands in 2017 on behalf of timeshare owners opposed to the taxation so this is something you should probably follow:https://www.marketplace.org/2017/08/04/econo…"
"Greetings! Not all timeshares are created equal. Most sold today are ""memberships"" where you buy points to use at your home resort or bank to use your points at other resorts. I purchased my timeshare over 20 years ago when you were actually purchasing fractional ownership in the unit or property. We own a 3/52nds of the specific unit. I believe the Ritz-Carlton residences next door to the Elysian were sold in a similar manner. There you purchased fractional ownership of a unit for a minimum of one month. Rather than buying a full condo and paying 100% of the cost and then having a property manager look after it when you weren't using the condo, you purchased one month for 1/12th of the cost and didn't have to worry about the day to day upkeep when you weren't on the island. That was the good old days. Timeshares have evolved into a different sort of animal over the recent years. I can see where the points purchasers or exchangers that just show up to the island should maybe pay this additional impact fee. What if you purchased a condo at Cowpet Bay West, paid the property taxes, insurance and fixed it up and then the government said that is great, but now you can only just stand back and look at it and for every night that you actually want to use your condo or sleep in it you owe us another $25 per night. I don't think you would be too pleased either. The government has painted all timeshare users with the same brush and has not distinguished between the fractional owners of the properties and the ""timeshare membership"" users. To me, there is a distinct difference. The fractional owners have deeded titles to their units. Whether I own a condo in joint names with a relative 50/50 or fractional 1/12th should not immediately make me subject to this surcharge. I will turn my unit back to Wyndham and let them find some sucker to come and rent my unit and they can pay the daily tax."
"As I said, a lawsuit has been filed so hopefully the link I provided will enable you to follow up on that."
"It will take years for the VI courts sadly. Odd that if there are 2 persons in a place or 8, they pay the same amount/day, so much for impact"
GMSIf you turn your timeshare back to the Wyndom will you still be responsible for the maintenance fees and assessments if any?If so do you get any income if it is rented?Can you just walk away without any liability?
"Until I physically sell the unit I will be responsible for the maintenance fees. I have a number of options. I can turn it over to Wyndham and they will try to rent it out and I would get to keep 50% of the total rental. I could rent it privately on the web and keep 100% of what I receive. Most likely because I am a member of RCI and so is the resort, I will bank my weeks with them and exchange for a holiday in Mexico or Florida. There is a fee to RCI for doing this exchange but I would rather pay a fee to them than the V.I. government and spend my vacation dollars elsewhere."
"This is crazy,,, what are they thinking.The island need people to come there to spend their money ."
"We, luckily, were able to sell our timeshare back to the Marriott. It was a platinum week, but we got a fraction of what we paid for it, but after having it for about a dozen years, tallying up the purchase price, the maintenance fees, and the taxes, we figure we broke even for the type of unit that it was. I hated having to book a year in advance, and forget about trading your week as there was never any place we wanted to visit that was available in that same time frame. Marriott introduced the point system that we wanted no part of, just more money for them. The maintenance fees and the taxes before this recent occupancy tax was about $2000. We also had to pay an additional fee due to the hurricane damage. We are SO happy not to be owners!! We can go anytime, anywhere we want. And, the best part, we can travel ANY day we want to get the best airfare or use air miles. The checking in on Friday, Saturday or Sunday was a pain. There are some timeshares listed for $1 just so the owners can get out of paying the maintenance fees. Also, agree with STTResident- no need to bash the island because of a government policy. ."
Garden girlI have heard timeshare owners tell the me the same story over and over again over the years. When I add in the number of timeshares on STT that have gone bankrupt in STT it amazes me that people are still buying them. Margarettaville is the latest and they send their sales people over to Sapphire most every day. I really don’t understand why they get people to buy them.
"Post-hurricane, the government and department of tourism should be providing incentives to tourists to visit the island, rather than putting impediments in place. Tourism is the life-blood of the island; however, it appears that the residents and the government think otherwise. Taxing tourists is not the route to go. I hope that the vacancy rate in future years will show them the light! Visitors that stay one, two or three weeks probably pump more into the economy than the day trippers from the cruise ships. The impact fee is misguided."
I agree and will not be back to St Thomas as the beaches are just okay compared to Mexico or South Florida. It is a grubby looking Island in places so don't know what they do with these fees that they collect. Don't like being ripped off so St Thomas you can keep your island to yourself and we will holiday somewhere else.
"Thank you, Dee12 for going elsewhere, truly appreciate it! We love showing visitors our home and would rather not have people coming here who think it's a grubby inferior place. Thank you for sharing with us your very first post and for coming to such a wise decision!"
"1) Beautiful Bill...they giving anything away? I could sit through a presentation for a camera. :) Or food. (Not more than an hour!)2) WOW Dee12, you haven't been to the same island and Mexico that I have. Mexico's beaches and water can't even compare to what I love about STT and the Caribbean. I don't worry about adulterated alcohol, being jacked by people on foot or in the car, and a myriad of other things that I don't enjoy about Mexico. The ONLY thing that STT offers that I don't 'enjoy' but will tolerate is just the higher price of food. But then again, I get that same sticker shock in other states and restaurants there."
I haven’t seen the Margarita timeshare sales crowd this year. Last year the sales pitch was an hour presentation and a $100 gift card. Turned out to be a 2 or 3 hour session and a $100 American Expresd card. Problem is very few if any places accept American Express down here. Typical timeshare scam.
Are you aware that the homicide and crime rate on STT is 35 times higher than on the mainland! My wife is very uncomfortable being out after dark on STT but has no issues in Aruba or some other islands in the Caribbean.
"GMS, people on these forums have been exceedingly patient reading your repeated vents about your Elysian timeshare disappointment: empathizing with you; suggesting ways of extricating yourself from the deal you signed up for which you no longer find tenable; nicely correcting a lot of misinformation you started to come up with (and continued to repeat even after being corrected); and generally being very polite.For you to come up now with such an obviously totally misleading and troll post is unacceptable. You don't like the deal you made and that's a shame. Too bad."
"I Agree, YOU signed the contract. We love STT and will be back in MARCH for two weeks."
"Huh. I was there alone last year for over a week, and had no issue being out by myself after dark. Went to various places, day and night. Didn't go anywhere I didn't need to be, though."
"GMS, it appears that your posts spreading misinformation about STT are a Machiavellian attempt to hurt tourism so that the Government will be forced to rescind the timeshare fee in order to increase tourism. Machiavellianism is conduct marked by cunning, duplicity or bad faith. You have consistently mischaracterized conditions on STT post-hurricanes, misrepresented the condition of the Elysian, cited crime statistics that have no connection to tourism (very little crime against tourists) and generally ranted against your timeshare costs (which you signed up for when you bought your 3 weeks). While you purport to want to improve the island economy with increased tourism, your posts are designed to hurt the island economy in the hopes you can avoid a $25/day timeshare fee. That duplicity and bad faith is the very definition of Machiavellianism! As an owner of a private non-Wyndham unit at the Elysian, and someone who loves STT and feels safe (as does my wife) almost everywhere on the island (as with any place there are areas to stay away from), I hope I never have the opportunity to meet you!As for Dee12, I enjoy Mexico but don't drink the water, don't leave the resort at night and by all means stay safe from the drug cartel members and the kidnappers!Edited: 1 year ago "
"Oops, I meant to say ""I hope you enjoy Mexico ......."" because I certainly do not enjoy it at all!"
The homicide national rate being 35 times higher was taken directly from a report published in the V.I. Daily News a few years back. If this is misinformation then the reporter of the newspaper is to blame!
"To date, this apparently has not been repealed. An Association/Owners newsletter I recall seeing in late 2018 alluded to the fee (read as: ""tax"") being repealed, however, my last visit there this month showed no sign of that repeal. The office folks at Marriott Frenchman's Cove were not aware of any such repeal or change. I personally find it ridiculous and possibly illegal for the USVI Government to be essentially ""double-taxing"" owners on the use of their property at a rate of $25 per day."
That must be why you can buy Marriott Frenchmans Cover timeshares originally $40k plus for as little as $2k now. Fees plus maintenance make it not worth it when it is the same cost as you can rent without the yearly committment.
It definitely hurts the timeshare owner benefit
"We have been to many tropical places in the world diving, hiking and touring on motorcycles and St Thomas Island is our least favourite on many levels. Are you serious? The large white sandy beaches of Mexico compared to the small and lacklustre little bays of St Thomas? We sailed around that area and once on the water between islands it was better.Edited: 11:26 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Aruba, Cayman Islands or St. Martin is cleaner and has more beautiful beaches than St. Thomas. The islanders are also much friendlier as well, especially the nice people of Aruba."
"It is indeed so nice to have so many choices of Caribbean islands from which to choose, each with its own unique character. None is ""better"" than another as everyone's perspective, wants and needs are highly subjective. I've had the good fortune to have been to many of them from the Bahamas down to the Grenadines. Some I've returned to several times, others haven't appealed to me at all - but I've never hesitated to recommend the latter to those looking for an experience that doesn't happen to appeal to me.I'm always a little saddened when I read disparaging comments about the US Virgin Islands but certainly wouldn't try and encourage someone to return who, for whatever reason, didn't find my home to their liking. So many islands, so many options!"
"Dee12, I wouldn't go to Mexico even if someone paid me. Different strokes for different folks."
I see St. Thomas will begin welcoming visitors to the island in June after the Covid-19 lockdown. Has the $25 per day impact fee been repealed yet or will the government decide to tax the crap out of all future visitors to try and make up for their revenue shortfall? Hotel/timeshare occupancy surely has suffered over the past years since this tax was imposed. Good luck with your post-pandemic recovery! I for one am still enjoying other islands and avoiding St. Thomas as a matter of principle.
"""Hotel/timeshare occupancy surely has suffered over the past years since this tax was imposed."" Really?Thanks for your good wishes on our recovery and good wishes are in return sent for your continued vacationing pleasures."
A lot of the remaining timeshares have been undergoing renovations. Covid-19 will be the determining factor not the $25 fee on occupancy.
"The V.I. government has determined that visitors pose a negative impact on the islands and in course imposed a $25/day environmental impact fee on visitors spending the night. In order to accommodate their wishes and keep the islands pristine, it is best if we visitors just stay away!"
"GMS, enough already. It's been over a year since you referred to St Thomas as a, ""garbage dump with palm trees"" and, despite that, you were kindly and politely given the information you needed to officially express your dissatisfaction with the imposition of the fee you so objected to.You've found other vacation spots which suit you much better so move on and enjoy them."
GMSThe $25/day fee is only on timeshares. There are still some timeshares but there are also plenty of condos and hotels. Don’t buy a timeshare.
"As owners, we supported the local economy for over 20 years. Instead of being welcomed with smiles and open arms to the island we are immediately reminded that the government has hit us with a negative impact fee. This feels like a slap to the face and it hurts and we now feel unwelcome and unappreciated. Perception is everything!"
"GMS, have you approached Wyndham and offered to simply give them you rdeeded fractional share in exchange for being released from your ongoing obligations? Wyndham doesn't do fractional ownership timeshares anymore (if they ever did). They bought out the original timeshare operator at the Elysian (Wyndham only owns 24 of the 63 condos ast the Elysian, and other 39 are privately owned) who did the deeded fractional interest share model. Wyndham's Vacation Club uses points and the deeded units are a pain for them to work around since certain weeks are deeded for each unit and they aren't available for points members. I'm guessing Wyndham would love to get rid of the deeded fractional shares to make their lives easier."
Thanks for the reply. I am keeping my ownership at the present time to bank my weeks with RCI and then exchange for vacations at other resorts in the Caribbean or Florida.
"I have watched this post go on for far too long. This is a TRAVEL FORUM. If you have issues with the government on St Thomas take it up with them. This really isn’t the place for it. Seriously, no one gives a crap about your financial problems. We are in the middle of a world wide pandemic and all you can think about doing is to continually whine about the $25/day fee for literally, like a year and a half. People talk all the time about “first world problems”. I never truly understood it before but I’m sure if I look it up, your original post would be the definition of it. Please stop. Move on. Leave the “garbage dump with palm trees” to those of us who appreciate it. There’s bigger things to focus on in life."
