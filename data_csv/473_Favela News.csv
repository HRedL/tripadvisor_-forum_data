They have a feeling of belonging to those places. What they want is the regularization and urbanization of the favelas,” Mr. Silva explained. Some residents have lived in their favelas since the 1960s, he said.There’s a rising trend of favela removals in Rio at this moment. In Mr. Silva’s opinion, the increasing pressures on the favelas is the result of a “growing interest in many city lands that can now reach high prices in the market.” For Mr. Brum, there is also an increasing prejudice among part of the Rio elite against favela residents.Edited: 7:26 pm, December 23, 2019 "
