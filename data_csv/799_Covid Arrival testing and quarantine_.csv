"Hi,Wondering how difficult/easy is to travel from different parts of the world.Me and my partner are planning to travel by the end of August to Tulum.I'm in the USA and He Is in Sweden. What type of regulations can we expect at the arrival moment?I saw that people will be tested, and if needed quarantine. Where is that quarantine happening if needed? One's place of residence, hotel?I want to get an understanding for all these possible scenarios.Any solid official information or first-hand experience knowledge will be great."
"Cancun airport never closed, but only Terminal 4 is open for international flights.Upon arrival, passenger temperatures are measured by thermal scanner (you might not even notice). Some passngers have had to complete a brief questionnaire. Passengers with elevated temperatures are taken aside for further examination, and if Covid-19 is diagnosed, expect to be isolated at a hospital for 2 weeks at your own expense.No mandatory quarantine period unless Covid-19 is diagnosed.Edited: 2:11 pm, July 21, 2020 "
Traveling to Cancun this weekend (August 15th 2020) . I was wondering if I can fill in the questionnaire from the USA the day before of arrival or if this questionnaire needs to have the date of arrival? I don't want to be stuck with a poor connection at the Cancun airport trying to complete this. Has anybody had any issues with the Questionaire upon arrival?
"Some passengers said they didn't have to complete a questionnaire, so don't worry about it -- it was only a brief form with a few questions. Just make sure you carry a pen because you also have to complete an FMM immigration form which should be handed out on the plane."
Thanks for the pointer. Always very helpful :)
And that FMM immigration form can be completed online and printed before you leave. Do you want more details?
"Things changes rapidly, info good today, may not be tomorrowStatistics Official gov website in mexico:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/https://sipse.com/novedades/cancun-preven-el…Google translate:The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that international tourism will take off from October, although the application of rapid tests to travelers will be essential.Gloria Guevara, president of the WTTC, explained that if rapid tests are not applied to travelers, the pandemic will not be controlled by affecting tourism, so states that receive people from other countries must take these decisions to increase confidence. They should not only be applied to those who have symptoms, as they must take into account that 80% are asymptomatic.Edited: 5:15 pm, August 12, 2020 "
Thanks!
"Funny how they can come up with a number (""80% are asymptomatic"", presumably they mean infected-but-asymptomatic), but never discuss the number of FALSE POSITIVE results that are thus asymptomatic because NOT infected.This is testing's dirty little secret, and I can't imagine a ""rapid"" test would be more accurate than the ""slow"" ones. But good luck finding hard data on test accuracy, I dare you.I'm not travelling if a false-positive test result can ruin your entire trip. Not worth the risk.Edited: 10:02 pm, August 12, 2020 "
Are travelers required to bring Results of a Covid test To get through immigration? Any requirements on return to US?
">> ""Are travelers required to bring Results of a Covid test To get through immigration?""No.>> ""Any requirements on return to US?""People are reporting that they had to complete a health questionnaire in Cancun airport. Also in Cozumel airport. Check some of the posts on the Cancun branch of the forum."
"Here's the link to a thread with some info about the questionnaire...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…I haven't needed to complete one, so can't help further."
"There is a COVID questionnaire to fill out at CUN before you go through security, on the return portion of your trip. We have done this twice. The form takes about 2 minutes to fill out; it can also be done via a QR code. You have to show that you have the form before you can move on toward the security checkpoint (you literally just wave the form in the air so they can let you pass), but no one collects it, no one reads it. Some people have reported that security will ask to scan the QR code, but both times we had the paper form and we were never asked for the form or the QR. It does not seem to be a very good system to collect information.Edited: 11:53 pm, August 12, 2020 "
