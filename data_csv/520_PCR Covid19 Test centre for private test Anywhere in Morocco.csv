"Hi all,As there seem to be no PCR Covid19 test centres in the north of Morocco for private tests (as per my previous thread posted, and my own extensive investigations), can anyone please inform me of a Covid19 PCR test centre *Anywhere* in Morocco..??- [N.B. A PCR Covid19 test is required within 72 hours of departure of the GNV Ferry to France, starting 27/07/20.]"
"[UPDATE]Having searched in French, I have seemingly found 2 places in Casablanca which do private PCR tests, and apparently the cost for private tests has been capped by the government at 500 Dirhams per test.The 2 places in Casablanca are:(1). L’hôpital Cheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Casablanca.(2). Le laboratoire national de référence relevant de l’Université Mohammed VI des sciences de la santé, Casablanca.Information found here: https://www.le360.ma/societe/depistage-covid…I will update again after making contact with these 2 facilities, and if anyone knows of any other places, then it would be appreciated if they could post that information,ThanksEdited: 10:23 am, July 24, 2020 "
Thanks for your hard work and for posting all this information.
