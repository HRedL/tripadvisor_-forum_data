Anyone else think this is in extremely poor taste?https:/…
Whoever does the social media of several of these casinos needs to be fired.
"They changed it. Took out COVID-19 and replaced it with ""More Beer!!!""Edited: 1:15 am, March 17, 2020 "
Aha! Then hopefully they did fire them.
And isn’t it St Paddy’s Day not St Patty’s
Why are the Irish in bad taste?
"Can we just laugh about it, and move on?"
Sounds like a disgruntled employee who was upset they hadn't shut the place down?
I think it’s kind of funny.
My sides are splitting!
Some top notch graphic design going on there...Who follows Casino Royale on Twitter?It looks like they've changed it to 3) More beer! with a different emoji...As someone who has been following a lot of Vegas news and virus news...I've come to the conclusion that attempts at humor concerning the pandemic have in large part fallen flat.
"""Anyone else think this is in extremely poor taste?""I do. This isn't a hurricane party in New Orleans...."
The only excuse I can think of is they were guilty of knowing their audience too well. People who are in Las Vegas right now looking to party on St. Patricks day probably thought it was hilarious.
Not too smart
Interesting to read the different comments.
Everything about Casino Royale is in bad taste. That is it’s schtik.
its shtick

They are catering to an audience of travellers who thought or think this isn’t a big deal and are still in town.
"It's Casino Royale, is anyone surprised?"
"The president said there was no reason he had to be tested for Coronavirus , as everyone knows he doesn’t drink alcohol...Inappropriate?"
"Not my idea of humor, but who knows what humor will look like in 3 mos.?Hunt"
It's Casino Royale....does anyone care ?
"I would enjoy at stop at Casino Royale or O'Sheas today but even saying it would be deemed inappropriate by the top judges on this forum. Perhaps in May, or June, or not this year.Edited: 11:47 am, March 17, 2020 "
"""I would enjoy at stop at Casino Royale or O'Sheas today but even saying it would be deemed inappropriate by the top judges on this forum.""There are no top judges on this forum. There are, however, recommendations from doctors, scientists, and public health officials."
Slade you are Top Judge! (In a Padma Lakshmi voice)If you don’t get it...meh fuggetaboutit.
In_Seeno: Thanks for not telling me to pack up my hand sanitizer and go
"Maybe the US is just lucky,but so far this virus thing is just a blip on the radar. Will be interesting to see how this pans out. Its only the panicky people and the hyper-info by the news media that have caused the economy to go to heck,and the stock market to plummit. Cant wait to see the results of all of this."

"Relax everyone, eat a piece of fruit or something!Nothing malicious about this... it's funny!It's St. Paddy's day.... I make,great (Covid-19) Irish Car Bombs! Sad I can't demonstrate but they pretty much just shut down Ontario today.That's in the country of Canada by the way."
"I feel like I was listening to the early comments of the President, when I read #28. lol"
"Pretty sure it would not be appropriate to order an Irish Car Bomb, or a Black n Tan in Ireland."
"“ Pretty sure it would not be appropriate to order an Irish Car Bomb, or a Black n Tan in Ireland.”Or in a lot of other places. I witnessed a cringe-worthy moment of a group of young Americans trying to order “ car bombs” in a pub in Galway. It didn’t end well."
"Dang,I love it when my post riles people up. Even if factual. lol"
"..hey, any attention is better than none for you."
Sense of Humor-they probably were referring to the panic that people are portraying all over the place - I have a sense of humor and see nothing wrong with this
I have a sense of humor too. But somehow it’s never extended to making jokes about a virus killing old people in nursing homes. I don’t think any part of that will ever be funny to me.
"""Maybe the US is just lucky,but so far this virus thing is just a blip on the radar""Such ignorant linear thought processing.Even with the massive amount of social distancing there will be 10,000's of cases in the US. It's a virtual mathematical certainty. Maybe many more. Today's numbers are almost guesses.And maybe 10,000+ compared to 340M people is tiny?Unless it is someone you know tjp?Your reasoning reminds me all too well of 6/5 bj players' rationale.Or the RF folks who can't do the math."
"""Even with the massive amount of social distancing there will be 10,000's of cases in the US. It's a virtual mathematical certainty. Maybe many more. Today's numbers are almost guesses.""Agree. To argue anything else is just stubborn ignorance.If even 30% of people get it and 1% of them die, that's 1,000,000 people. In what world is that a ""blip"" I wonder?"
"Many of you need to re-read my post. It reads ""as of now"" . No need to add futuristic wording to it just to shoot me down. On the other hand,some of you are so dang good at that behavior.lol But it is fun to read."
Starting to think if the economic impact of this is made worse by the actions taken instead of letting the virus take its course. So I guess that makes me a bad person for thinking that.
"Nah...you're a bad person because of an overall lack of character, not just for one ridiculous thought. Chin up!"
"We are faced with balancing the need to “flatten the curve” with trying to minimize the impact on the economy.Flatten the curve. Pay attention to the new guidelines. And for those who don't like to comply, at least respect social distancing."
"Thanks Slade, so basically I am a bad person since I am a douche. Not because I am thinking of the economic impact. Whew, that is a relief."
"Roadtriip, I wasn't judging. I don't have enough information. I was just sending you on the road to self discovery so you can decide for yourself."
"Salty one more post for 2,000"

"2salty. As of now and but so far,read the same for me. But allow me to correct myself and insert ""as of now"". There. Better? And ,of course,I do not think this is a lol situation. But some of the comments and feelings here are. There are way too many alarmists and snowflakes out there making things worse I think. As always,time will tell whether this much alarm was justified. I am concerned that in the future,every flu strain will cause this kind of pandemonium. Okay all,give it to me.lol Oops,I didnt mean to use lol."
How is “this virus thing” “just a blip on the radar?” There’s cases in every state now so I guess with your logic there’s thousands of blips on the radar and soon to be hundreds of thousands perhaps. 13
