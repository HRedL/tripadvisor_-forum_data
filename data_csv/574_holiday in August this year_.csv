"i know nobody has a crystal ball and cant predict what way the world will be in 4 months time but i was wondering what the general feeling is amongst the hotels and tourist industry in Dubrovnik and Croatia in general is, has it been reported in the media?Im booked for 1st Aug, if we get to go that would be a big bonus, at the moment im taking it that it wont happen unless there is an amazing turn aroundas i said if anyone has any local knowledge or idea of what the general view in Croatia is i would be interested to hear"
No one knows. https:/…42659-gari-cappelli
That’s a very interesting article and I agree the conclusion is nobody knows what will happen and those in tourist industry are hoping to get some sort of tourist season this year the matter how small.
"thanks, thats all very interestingone point i will make regarding your article, although brexit has happened we will be following EU rules until DEC20 and this could even be extended due to the virus situation."
"thats a fair point, i didnt realise you still needed visa's to travel here from Bosnia etcthere are so many variables to take into account and i suppose its just a matter of keeping an eye on developments over next few months."

Agree Tarik at 9. Most countries are waiting to see a peak with a levelling off after a plateau of reported infections and guess this will differ in terms of timing for us all . Where l live l am on the border in Wales that meets England and over the predicted furthering of lovely weather over Easter there will be police out looking for those who think they can holiday as normal . Restrictions here are vital for North Wales that depends heavily on tourism as in many places but the locals need to be kept safe to continue their hospitality in the future whenever this is safe to do so . Stay safe all of you ....
"Saw in one other of your post replies too Tarik that young folk seem to be disregarding social distancing as here too. I am giving my age away here as for me ' Forever Young ' by Joan Baez that can be heard on Utube should be a forever reminder for all of us at anytime particularly when you hear her say "" may you have strong foundations when the winds of changes shift "" ."
"My daughter has a school trip planned for Croatia and Hungary for July. She’s been looking forward to it for months, I hope she can still go!"
"Hope that Latvia with our today - 666 cases of virus ( only ~ 45 of them in hospitals ) and 5 deaths ( including 99.years old woman ) will be in list of 'safe for travel without carantine' EU countries.And all other bordering countries - Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary in direction to Croatia as well.:)"
"We are watching Croatia as well as we are booked to spend 2 weeks there starting Aug.7. Spending a week on a Sail Croatia cruise and a week ( a few days before and after the cruise) exploring on our own. Thankfully Sail Croatia has loosened their final payment due date to 30 days before the cruise departs so we have some time to decide. Have never been to Croatia before and am/was looking so forward to it, but I also don't want to drop this amount of cash and not get to see/experience everything! Hoping some locals will be bale to keep us up to date as well as continue our own research! Stay safe everyone!"
"The U.K. government has this week advised against booking any summer holidays, either in the U.K. or abroad, which indicates their thoughts on what’s likely to happen over the next few months including your trip. I don’t think there’s going to be any travel this year or none without 14 days quarantine at each end. The ridiculous scenes from America over the weekend of people ignoring social distancing and protesting about the lockdown has ensued that cautious Europe isn’t likely to want to see any American tourists any time soon for fear of spreading the virus."
"Hi, sorry to contradict you but thats not actually true, a UK govt minster made an off the cuff remark that ""he certainly would not be booking a sunner holiday at the moment"" He has been widely criticised by the travel industry and it has been clarified that it was a personal opinion and not govt policy.I am not saying that he is wrong and we will be having our summer holidays, it looks increasingly unlikely. Im just clarifing that the UK govt did not make this statement"
some information here but as with anything else its mostly specualtionhttps://www.thedubrovniktimes.com/news/croat…
"Hi, there is no policy in the UK to keep the borders closed until September. One govt minister has suggested not to book any holidays before then but he has been quickly reprimanded and forced to state this is not govt policy.Of course things are changing very quickly and it could of course be govt policy to close the borders until September sometime in the near future but at the moment this is not the case"
I’d prepare you daughter for the announcement that she won’t be traveling to Europe this summer. The US is now the epicenter of Coronavirus and no one is ready to welcome American tourists. My daughter was studying in Austria and got sent home March 14th. Tremendous disappointment and financial loss for us.
from what ive read Croatia will be open for business this summer but will restrict tourism initalially to Austrians and Czech's
"I'm ready for yet another passport!) In our city at a moment numbers of infected is from none to one, siting home with remission."
Do you know when the next meeting of the EU tourism ministers is scheduled for as Croatia organised the last one? Thanks
"Hi folks, is there any further news this week?"
https:/…43388-croatian-tourism
"Thank you, that is a very interesting update"
I have booked 1 night in Mostar during my week In Dubrovnik so that is another part of travel I have to take account off. Obviously I would be very happy to be able to go to Dubrovnik and Mostar is just a day but it has been I long time ambition of mine to visit Mostar and I might never get chance again

HiWe are booked for Mlini (near Dubrovnik) 30 June for 1 week. I have managed to speak to a couple of good sources in the area and unfortunately it's unlikely that UK tourists will be allowed in any time soon without self-isolating. I was thinking about postponing to October but my research makes even that unlikely. There are so many variables but with no flights or airport and FCO advising against travel we are looking at next year. Sorry its a disheartening post but I have looked at every option and know how you feel
"Chris, i have spoken to several well placed sources and they are of the opposite opinion of your and they believe some for of international holidays (including UK) will be up and running in Julyhowever none of this really matters, its just speculation, and whatever happens happens"
"thanks, will keep an eye on that"
Yesterday one of the UK tabloid newspapers had a story suggested that the Croatian prime minister was pushing for a ban of UK tourists throughout the EU this summer because of the high British death rate. There was nothing in the story to back this up with links and nothing i could find online to support it.
"Yes, it was a very vague and misleading article in the daily mail uk. They post contradictory articles simultaneously."
"Has anyone heard anything about visitors from the USA? We are sch'd to visit in Aug also but I've been expecting that we'll more than likely need to postpone until next year. We will need to make a final decision soon. However, if there are no major disruptions or self-isolation measures (aside from the normal social distancing, etc) then it could end up being a wonderful holiday without the hoards of tourists typical in high season. ...wishful thinking perhaps?"
Laurence- We are in the same boat coming from the USA. Supposed to fly out Aug. 5. We have until July 1 to make our final decision. Would absolutely love to go if possible and safe. Things change every single day so it’s so hard.
"Hi just looking for my weeky update re my holiday in Dubrovnik on 1st Aug and if its likely to go aheadThe 14 day curfew on return to UK isnt a particular problem for us, we could manage it okany curfew when arriving in Croatia would not be possible though"
"Nobody knows yet who'll be permitted to enter Croatia. Our politicians talk about bilateral agreements. If UK demands from us 14 day curfew on entering the country, expect to be the same for UK citizens when arriving to Croatia. At least that's my impression when listening to our politicians."
"yes, i agree that would be fair although not good for me"

"There's no date yet when the borders will open. Right now only citizens of Croatia, those with residence, essential workers, those (incl. their close family) owning a real estate, and a special agreement with neighboring Hungary about near border work-living crossover can enter. According to our Ministry of the Interior no opening before July. That's like one side. Then there's a lot in the media about bilateral agreements between Croatia some EU member states, again nobody knows which countries are in question. Speculators point at countries with similar epidemic situation. Others in direction of equal treatment of each others citizens. Latest bulletin: bilateral agreements reading healthcare coverage in case foreigners have symptoms while on holiday. Hotels shall provide Covid-19 rooms in case having infected guests. Where I live not everyone will host tourists this year, this includes some hotels too. Our municipalities are tiny micro ones compared to other countries. We had lock down based on the borders of each municipality. My municipality literally lies between two traffic lights, by the time you reach fourth gear you've already crossed the borderline.Edited: 4:57 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"Today can't find among myacquaintances here in Latvia even one, who continue into pandemic speaches. ""Much ado about nothing"" - the most popular proverb of these days.Complete cognitive dissonance between talking (and imposed rules ) of politicans and confidence of people."
"Literally translation from Latvian of this proverb -""Massive hullabaloo - small wool"". Some conotation with sheep shearing.Edited: 6:58 am, May 18, 2020 "
"No idea what you are referring to, but if you expect traveling conditions from last year simply forget it. I doubt any country in Europe will re-open without restrictions. Locals are restricted, people coming on business purpose too, property owners, hotels and so on, expecting as a tourist not to be restricted is naive. I still have no idea what to do in case of one of my guests is infected or shows symptoms, and eventually tested positive. What about the rest of guests? Self isolation? Where? What if our municipality is ordered to shut down, nobody can enter or exit."
"I just mentioned, using popular proverb, that by mainstream opinion of Latvian people,used kind of quarantine was overreaction to problem of virus spreading. We even have light version of quarantine - freedom of movement inside country,no closed municipalities, no e-pass, and freedom for going out.2. million people living in our country.. 19.deaths (with flu last year - 86), counting broadly everyone infected, bit more than 50.people was in hospitals all the time in all country, ~ 1000 tested virus positive. In our 40 000 people city NO ONE all the time (!) with virus in hospital. We even arranged another hospital only for Kovi patients. 100% empty.Call how you want, but it isn't even epidemic!Edited: 9:00 am, May 18, 2020 "
"Speaking about distancing and disinfection of hands - we use it. But we cleaned hands many times per day already before. :) And IMO it's only sane way to deal with all kinds of viruses, with whom we don't want to get acquainted . I personally in virus spreading season use another old fashioned cure to deal with flu - putting little bit of 72% natural household soap ( usually used for washing clothes ) with bit of water inside around my nose. In morning and evening. It really works.IMO it's very little possibility that you will have someone with virus in your apartments.In principle it's the same as one suddenly get sick with heart or other disease. It's possible, but statistics show that percentage of risk is small.Some protocol, of course, will be useful, what to do in such situation.Edited: 9:18 am, May 18, 2020 "
"To my knowledge there's a mandatory 14-days self isolation on arrival to Riga or any other part of Latvia. Don't expect any meager regulations in Croatia. Foreign property owners are subject to strict conditions on arrival, despite they don't pose logistical or humanitarian issue in case of a new lock-down is imposed.Edited: 4:04 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"From now those coming from Lithuania and Estonia,no more have 14.day quarantine in Latvia and otherwise. It's small sign of eventual normalisation."
"Not bring funny but I asked a question about Croatia, Dubrovnik to be specific. Are posts about Latvia and Estonia really relevant to this?"
I am due to fly to Dubrovnik from the UK middle of August. We are putting quarantine restrictions on those arriving here from end of May but how long this will be for we havent been told. I think its just a waiting game. Do people think UK visitors will be allowed into Croatia though. I know nobody can be sure but what is the feeling there?
"Everything is relevant. Faster situation all around EU will be normal, faster people from outside EU will be allowed into."
"No tourists can enter Croatia. Those who have booked hotel cannot unless they are for business purposes here. My guests were turned away on the border despite they had valid booking. This happened this morning, around 11 am. People who own a real estate or have a boat in Croatia can enter. Their close family members if they carry official documents proving relations can enter too. Others are essential workers or people coming on business invitation. Kaz: nobody knows, nothing yet is official regarding who can enter as regular tourist. My best guess is we'll have something official sometime mid / late June.No regular tourists can enter. I did phone MUP today, they told me those with hotel bookings only if on a business trip. No pleasure etc.Edited: 1:31 pm, May 19, 2020 "

"RIEugenThanks, waited for your sane commentary.About this I have been thinking already before - it's pure business - from one side renting accomodation and from other - living in it.People buy possiblity to be here. What other business I, for example, can do in Croatia - to sell some small things taken with me?If no one want to buy them, it's their problem.:):):)But what about mentioned staying for foreigners in different towns?Edited: 3:44 pm, May 19, 2020 "
"RiEugen not true. Foreign citizens can enter based on purpose of business not pleasure. My guests where turned away despite having valid booking, because the nature of visit was pleasure. I phoned MUP earlier today and they told me no tourists can enter for pleasure."
"Our minister of Tourism on Dubrovnik:""Osvrnuo se i na Dubrovnik, koji kao većinom turistička aviodestinacija s 90 posto turista koji dolaze zrakoplovima sada dosta trpi jer nema letova, kazavši da su nedavno imali vrlo ozbiljan razgovor s premijerom Andrejem Plenkovićem i dubrovačkim gradonačelnikom Matom Frankovićem oko rješavanja pitanja luke, turizma i avioprometa. Odlučeno je da će se, ako ništa drugo ne bude moguće, ići s letovima Croatia Airlinesa za Dubrovnik s posebnim programom udruženog oglašavanja s HTZ-om, izvijestio je Cappelli.""In short: Andrej Plenkovic and Dubrovnik Mayor Mato Frankovic on resolving the issues of ports, tourism and air traffic. It was decided that, if nothing else is possible, Croatia Airlines flights to Dubrovnik will go with a special program of joint advertising with the HTZ,The arrival by air will most likely be subject to massive control which might include test on arrival etc."
"Source to it? If this is the fact then explain to me why were my guests turned away they had a booking but not in a hotel. Does this only apply to hotels or any other type of accommodation? Explain to me how come my neighbor who arrived today had whole different story at the border.On Sunday I await arrival of my second neighbor from Sweden who owns the house next to ours. He needed to apply for permit to cross the border despite despite owning a house in Croatia. If you are so well informed surely you're capable of answering these questions to me. Or maybe that little corner of Croatia where you from runes under different set of rules? I am in close touch with the tourist Board in Makarska, the same with the administration on the island of Korcula. They have different guidelines at lest toward us who rent homes and apartments. My mailbox is literally jammed due to influx of mails on minutes paste from potential tourists etc. Most of them refer to news from their respective embassies. I cannot rely on your information because this is pure speculation. If true what you write then nobody grants, since it is up to the police officer to buy the story. I cannot say to my guests- ""sure you dive, tell 'em it's because of business"". Unless prime minister or the minister of Tourism go public and tell, we did this to beat the system, fair enough. Otherwise it's pure gamble.Edited: 7:30 am, May 20, 2020 "
"See - it can take some time to go back to adequacy,because in every peoples ( including officials ) heads continues psychological fighting between sanity and insanity, rised by following effects of respiratory disease Kovi - panic and mass psychosis.In principle things happens as with two parties in politics - one - hardliners, who want to continue on forbidding measures in some or less form, but other want to get rid from everything inadequate and artificial."
"Croatia is not a Banana republic. I mean if somebody wants to gamble and try with the excuse ""it's a business trip"" fair enough. But what if a police officer says - no you cannot enter. Now my guests were only 200km away from their home when it happened to them. They were honest, told the police we're here to enjoy the sea. Now try to imagine someone arriving by car from Riga. It's 1.700 plus kilometers in one direction. Jammed border with entire families all calming to be on a ""business trip"", staying in uncle Jozo's cabin. I know we're not as sophisticated as Norway or Sweden, but please don't make it sound like Croatia is a Banana republic."
Very useful thank you. I note his speculation about maintaining ‘strict measures’ for 6 months instead of lifting them sooner - to be balanced with the economy I guess. And the possible requirement to quarantine. We are due to go late August but I think my mind is settled now on deferring till next August-Sept.
celticchickadeewhere are you getting the information about strict measures for 6 months and the need to quarantine for 14 days in Croatia ?
In that article posted earlier in the thread - but it’s not saying this is what will happen just that IF they delay reducing those things they may fare better disease wise. It’s just pointing that out and that an early reduction in control measures could backfire.

"""One more detail... Destination experts are really useful to explain these details in actual very specific times.""Sounds like a bloated head to me more than factual advise.""There is no need for insults and vilification.""You should take your own advise and not insult and threaten poster £€$."
"Mark, you are a new poster so you are fishy!Why such hostile feelings to DE's? RiEugen is telling the truth, we have seen news today with reports on exact number of tourists in the country. I remind all of the respective users of the forum that we provide information on voluntary basis here. I would recommend everyone to get information from official authorities if in doubt. It definitely takes time and good will to advise anyone.Tourists can enter Croatia with booking confirmation as explained earlier and that is the truth. It's been only a short time since all the gradual changes took place so it is normal that people are confused.For your kind information-poster €$£, a tourist is ANYBODY who changes place of residence for more than 24hours. You are obviously not happy with the government, but this is not a political forum. Gary, by July and August many things might change so speculating is all you can do. By the way, most of the tours booked by UK tour operators are postponed until September(at least in my case).I expect plenty of individual tourists, very few or no groups and perhaps rise of smaller group tourism vs.massive big tour groups. Tourism needs safety and I think this is what our government is concerned about, taking one step at the time. This is ideal destination for relaxing holidays so I hope all of you wishing to travel will be able to do so."

Know the feeling! This is why I’m postponing I can’t be doing with the uncertainty and after being told Our holiday in March was definitely going and no way could we cancel or rebook we were turned around as we walked to the plane! Not going there again it’s too disruptive and tho we got a full refund there were some other non refundable costs and a wasted week off work!
"Tarik, I thank you sincerely for all your efforts. You were updating regularily as the news were popping up. Definitely, there should be an official site with Q&A for travelleres, it is indeed a full time job. There is room for improvement and this should be introduced by government definitely.Mark, fishy because the new ones usually appear only to pick up the fight, which I hope is not your case. This is a friendly forum and I think most of us are friendly people, who like to help, by nature.As Tarik said, we don't have a magic wand with access to Minister of Tourism, Interiors etc and are also depending on MEDIAS.I am sorry, didn't see anything ""missleading"", my interpretation is that YES, TOURISTS CAN COME TO CROATIA, provided that they have either a business reason or a booking for the accommodation. After 15th of June it might change since for the time being only the EU tourists can come. I find missleading if a poster pushes his own negative experience and exgagarate things.Anyway, official sites are there so I am sure everyone can read those, to avoid ""misinterpretation"" at forum."
"Thanks for the article Tarik, I like your google working :-) Just saw the news, 7000 cars have entered Croatia through Bregana, 4000 of them are foreigners. Minister of tourism anounced to introduce an app by next week- meant for foreigners to speed up the entrance and avoid crowds.He said it will be ""similar to e-pass"".

I will respond when I have a little more time.
"Thank you RiEugen, much appreciated! It is great that information is available :-)"
"“Now, when everything is clear I just hope that those who have engaged themselves into a defamation campaign and unnecessary quarrel and will recognize all the useless efforts. It is so sad and shameful what they have been doing for several last days.”Well, you did pretty well engaging in shameful behaviour. To be honest, the only reason I bothered to contribute is your behaviour, especially towards £€$. He had an experience that directly affected him. You dismissed it, intimidated him and accused him of spreading misinformation. You even threatened to report him to TA. Obviously you have no idea how TA works. Besides, at the time, his position was the official policy. You could have put your case/opinion forward, even though it wasn’t official policy at the time, without being nasty towards the poster. Read your post 69.How would you like to drive from north of one of European countries only to be turned away at the border? Even if it happened to one person, as it did to £€$’s customer, it is one person too many to be put through unnecessary hassle.RiEugen, I suggest you be a little more civil and understanding towards those you might not agree with, instead of bullying them. It is the least, a worthy DE would do."
"Don't be so hypersensitive. RiEugen was polite and discreet. His prognoses was sane and adequate. Those Hungarian guests have choose improper time of arrival. Maybe to quick.

Hi Gary. We are also booked for the first week in August. Jet2 flights resume from 1st July.Have you cancelled or do you think you will get to go away?
HiI definitely won’t be cancelling as I would lose all my money. I’m prepared to go if possible and do quarantine when we get home.I would probably better if jet2 cancelled though and then we would get a full refund
"I’ve now rebooked with Jet2 for next Sept, there’s increased risk for us to consider and didn’t want to find that test were running it but we felt not safe enough to go. Croatia / Dubrovnik seems pretty pricey so can’t afford that kind of £ loss or to go and not have a good time because of restrictions that as they say can be imposed at any time. And doubt my workplace would be impressed with people possibly quarantined for two weeks! All in all for us it’s best to wait."
"Thank you to the DE's and others that have taken the time to research and fill us tourists in on what is happening currently in Croatia regarding tourism! As a DE for another area, I understand the work it can take to provide current, up to date information! Add COVID19 to the mix and the changes are being made daily! Hard to keep up!Does anyone have any info in regards to tourists coming in from the United States? Like I said in an earlier post, we are scheduled to arrive in Dubrovnik Aug. 6, stay there a coupe days. board a Sail Croatia cruise for a week, disembark in Split and stay there a couple days before heading to Zadar for a couple days then flying home! We are so hoping to still be able to go, but we do not want to quarantine upon arrival in Croatia! Any insight specific to to travelers from the USA would be much appreciated!"
"In this post we provide information and travel advice that should be helpful if you have already booked a holiday in Croatia or are considering a holiday for later this year or next year. Croatia's borders are now open to tourists who have pre-booked accommodation. The borders are open to all foreign tourists not just EU citizens. Croatia has a low incidence of COVID-19. Only 100 deaths at 26 May. Last Updated - 26 May 2020 11.00Croatia currently has a low incidence of COVID-19. As at 26 May 2020, 2244 confirmed cases and 100 deaths. Croatia closed its borders to foreign travellers and restricted internal movement at an early stage but from 28 April started a stepped reduction in lockdown restrictions. Over the weekend of 16/17 May Croatia opened its borders to foreign tourists who have pre-booked accommodation before entering the country, There has remained some conflicting information on Government websites but these sites are gradually being corrected. There has remained some confusion as to whether the borders were open to all foreign nationals or just EU citizens. The main Croatian government website providing information for travellers specifically stated that the borders were open to EU citizens but did not provide such a clear cut statement in respect of non-EU citizens. Croatian Villa Holidays has however obtained a written confirmation from the Border Police Directorate that the borders are open to all foreign nationals and at our request have specifically stated that they were open to UK, US and Norwegian nationals. All tourists entering Croatia will need to present a formal confirmation that accommodation has been booked showing the address of where they are staying. Tourists entering the country will be given instructions on the procedures and rules they must follow for social distancing and reporting any symptoms of COVID-19. Hotels have been permitted to open if they observe social distancing rules."

Thanks for the update @GaryBelfast - any idea if tourists visiting the likes of churches and museums in Croatia will have to where masks like they will have to in Italy? We are booked to visit Tuscany in September but that mask restriction may sway us to rebook to Croatia instead if no facial coverings are required there. My wife works in the NHS and has to wear full PPE on a daily basis so doesn't want to do that on holiday too. If both countries require face masks we might just postpone our European jaunt until May next year and have a 'staycation' in Scotland in September instead.
"Article in todays Daily Mail (uk) that says Croatia will open to tourists from 15 June although British tourists will be restricted.It does say this could later be lifted.***********just posting for reference, im not saying this article is factually correcthttps:/…Edited: 10:42 am, May 28, 2020 "
I checked with our UK travel insurance provider on Friday and their view was we will be unlikely to be travelling to Croatia in August. I am going to continue watching for updates from UK Gov on travel policy and make a decision to cancel (as we are covered) mid July. Croatia may be fully open but decide to exclude the UK which is a possibility.
"Gary, thanks for helping us out finding accurate information.I would stick to official information published on the official sites of Croatian government. Seek email confirmation from the authorities if in doubt.Please do not rely on newspapers as it has been proven that even the ""serious"" British papers are not always publishing accurate information (actually no medias are 100% trustworthy in my modest opinion).Edited: 7:02 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"I emailed the ministry of Interior for the Republic of Croatia at this email address: policija@mup.hr and received this response. Just to be careful and sure, I will email them again after June 15. In my email I gave them all of my flight information and where we will be staying. We are flying in from the USA so I do not think the driving across the border info pertains to me. Maybe I should fill out the forms they suggest just in case. Dear Madame, Nationals of Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovenia, Germany and Slovakia do not need special reason to enter Croatia and also nationals of other countries who have residence permit in this ten countries. All other foreign nationals who provide a proof of reservation for turistic accommodation will be allowed to enter Croatia. This rules are valid until 15th of June. We don`t have information what rules will valid be after that. In order to reduce traffic jams at border crossing points and waiting times to cross the border which will increase compared to border checks in the past few years due to the fact that additional data need to be collected from passengers, we recommend foreign nationals who intend to stay in the Republic of Croatia to provide their data in advance by filling in the form on the website entercroatia.mup.hr. Passengers who provide their data in this manner will not have to waste additional time to provide the necessary data at the border crossing point since border police officers will have access to their data in the system. Furthermore, passengers who provide their data in this manner will receive confirmation on their e-mail address that their announcement of visit has been received, as well as all other necessary information concerning the instructions and recommendations issued by the Croatian Institute of Public Health. Passengers who fail to provide their data through the said application in advance will be able to do so at the border crossing point when entering the Republic of Croatia but this will require more waiting time in a separate lane.
