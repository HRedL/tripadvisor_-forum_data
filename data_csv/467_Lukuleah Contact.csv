Hi allI have been trying to contact the owner of Lukuleah given that we will no longer be traveling in May and need to either change booking for May 2021 or request refund. Have sent 2 messages so far and still no reply which is really unusual. Wondering if anyone in Rarotonga is in contact with the owners or can shed some light on why I may not be getting a reply?Thanks
"Hi Melnotes,the owner is definitely here on Raro. He followed me along the main road on Friday, heading for Arorangi.Phone (682) 29984."
"Thanks so much Frangipani, wonder why he isn't replying to emails or my test messages then?Stay safe :)"
"I do hope that the accommodator has replied to your emails by now, Melnotes?Tomorrow night we also go into lockdown on Raro. The Pa Enua has already shut its islands to outsiders. Wise move.I remain safe by keeping my 2 metre distance, although I do see recent arrivals from overseas out and about as if it is a joy-ride here. They are supposed to be in monitored self quarantine, same as NZ expresses with its border controls.I am most sorry to learn that after careful planning and considerable patience, that you have been caught out by unforeseen circumstances in the global pattern. We will be here and viable when your combined trip to our shores finally takes place.Kia Manuia e kia kaha!"
"No reply yet and have sent 3 messages now with most recent requesting a date change to 2021. Stay safe and I'm sorry to hear that visitors are not following the rules putting others at risk. It is a shame that we will not be traveling to Rarotonga best decision though.Will let you know how I get on with Lukuleah, hoping it all sorts itself out!"
"Pleased to report all sorted with travel rebooked for May 2021, by then might need more than a weeks holiday.Hope you are all keeping safe and well, life in lockdown certainly makes you appreciate all things we so often take for granted."
"Hi Melnotes,I'm especially pleased to hear that you now have your booking sorted, with the dates in May 2021 locked in.We are trying to stay as safe as we can here, with no covid19 being confirmed as yet on Raro. Some of the businesses that are open have taken on a military precision-like approach to the number of customers entering a shop/business and the need to sanitise hands before joining the queue and entering.Very good practice though just in case someone brings the virus into the Cook Islands.Take care and if you need a week's holiday before you arrive Raro, there is a good case for domestic tourism with the many wonderful places to explore around NZ. Kia kaha."
"Thanks Frangipani, you stay safe too. My wish for your beautiful country is that you remain COVID-19 free."
"Fingers crossed, melnotes. The fact that we are down to 2 flights per week from Auckland at present helps tremendously.No Virgin and no Jetstar, and those on the Air NZ flights are required to go into a 14 day quarantine. But like NZ that needs to be enforced to protect the rest of us."
