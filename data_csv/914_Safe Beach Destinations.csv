"We are looking for a safe (as safe as can be while traveling) destination to visit in August from Pittsburgh. We were originally hoping to fly to Florida but with the uptick in COVID-19 cases, we think we should look elsewhere. We aren’t completely opposed to flying. We are looking for a decent hotel on the beach with a poolside/beach bar. We would like some activities nearby (shopping, restaurants, etc). We have been considering Cape May, NJ or traveling north east to Maine, Mass, etc. Also considering flying to LA but not sure that is the best destination right now either. Open to ideas and suggestions!"
"Hi, Melanie. Is your question about ""safe"" focusing on COVID-19 exposure or crime or what?If it is related to COVID-19, that is a tough question and a personal decision. Places that have relatively few COVID-19 cases today could be hotspots tomorrow. It mostly comes down to how and when things reopen, and how people conduct themselves. Personally, I am taking a wait and see approach towards committing to travel given the fluid COVID-19 situation. I likely will not book any travel far in advance unless it can be canceled for a full refund to my original form of payment. I also will give more consideration to places where I can avoid crowds once at the destination. I don't like crowded beaches anyway, so I would opt for quieter beaches with less activities, but it sounds like having activities available is something that is important to you.I also think an important factor is what you will be able to do on vacation where ever you decide to go. Personally, although I understand that certain amenities might not be available at resorts or local tourist attractions might not be open due to COVID-19 related reasons, it would be pretty disappointing to spend a lot of money and not have a good vacation experience. In terms of places you mentioned, I have heard good things about Cape May, but I have not been there or to any New England beaches. Assuming ""LA"" is ""Los Angeles"", Southern CA has some nice beaches, but you need to feel comfortable flying and be willing to adapt to changing restrictions. The CA governor has shown more willingness to shut things down when COVID-19 cases rise than the Florida governor, for example. I personally prefer the San Diego area over LA, but there are nice beaches between the two cities (about a two hour drive) as well. In a normal year, Southern CA beach resorts are really expensive.You didn't mention where in Florida you were considering, but you may want to look more closely at local data, since the COVID-19 cases may be more prevalent in certain areas (e.g., Miami). My dermatologist splits time between an office in Maryland and one in Southwest Florida, and as of a few weeks ago, he did not think COVID-19 was a big concern in the SW part of the state."
"Thank you for the reply - yes we are looking for COVID “safe” destinations. Obviously there is a risk with any travel but looking for something more low key to avoid the crowds. We don’t need a ton of activities around, mostly looking for a quiet bar to have a few drinks after dinner. We were thinking of a small town to give us some space to walk around without being overly crowded."
"There's beautiful low key beaches all along the Florida panhandle, Alabama shoreline, etc In California, consider Orange County destinations like Newport Beach or Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, San Clemente, Dana Point.. all beautiful, low key, and not LA. Lol. Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente are much smaller towns, quaint town centers, surfers and farmers markets, etc. May be worth a look..Enjoy, and good luck!"
"There are no safe Covid destinations anywhere in the world.Go have fun, bring and wear your mask when around others, and wash your hands thoroughly multiple times a day. Done."
Have you had any luck finding a destination. This is what we are looking for too.
