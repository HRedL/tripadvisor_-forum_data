"All construction on private and public works have been suspended and 180,00 workers throughout the State of Quintana Roo (80-90,000 in Cancun) have been told to return to their home states. There will be no more work for them here as all new projects have been halted.https:/…"
"The situation is getting very ""real"" now, and the future may portend what many of us in the U.S. now are calling the New Normal. As of the last reports I've seen Q.R. has 37 confirmed case of COVID-19, 30 being analyzed, 1 death, and the remainder negative cases of a 193 suspected cases with very limited testing procedures. It may not seem concerning based on the numbers right now but apparently as of yesterday, Quintana Roo had the highest positive count 2.2 per 100K of population tested in all of the States of Mexico. And, as I stated, the testing is extremely limited much like we saw in the U.S and other countries early on with primary testing being mainly done on folks that had a recent Far East contact and who also are showing symptoms. Hopefully, what has occurred in other high rate areas of the world aren't going to happen here."

"One frightening thing to me is that while other countries were caught unprepared to test at first, they quickly ramped up their efforts. From what I see, Mexico has done little of that with few being tested nationwide."
https:/…Not looking good even into the Fall.
This reminded me of one sad story I read today. At least four people on their way home died when their bus collided with a taxi in Tulum. Many more were injured. So much bad luck for these poor people.
"I saw that too, Robert. As bad as it was, it could have been worse as the bus was full at the time."
"Robert, Judy.... this is terrible. I hope both of you stay healthy. This is just the beginning down there. My prayers are with everyone. Truly unbelievable"
"All I can do is SMH; I still remember posts from one TA contributor from Canada (also happened to be from Canada's Covid19 hotspot Totonto) who bragged and insisted on traveling to Cozumel for a planned March Springbreak trip. They (the 3 of them were asymptomatic), but had to have been exposed and thereby unwittingly carriers of the virus, and potentially exposed EVERYONE they came in contact with both on flights and on the ground on Cozumel. Most unfortunate for the locals who were (potentially) exposed all because someone felt ""entitled to their vacation in Mexico"" (since the borders were not yet closed and flights still flew). Extremely selfish thinking potentially exposing everyone on Coz.Stay strong Mexico. You will get through this too, eventually. ¡Diviertanse!"
"I think we all understand what happens when people refuse to follow the rules and expose others. But really, we were discussing another topic here and I do feel really bad for these workers in particular."
"Its unfortunate to hear, but this virus is destroying many economies world wide."
