https:/…This is for international and out of state arrivals.
I guess that’s the final nail in our 2020 trip.
Our July Boston and Las Vegas trips are pau now.
"kaukau, looking forward to that empty beach in Kapalua this month!! I hope the others down south are just as empty. Sorry about your trips to yonder, you too grandeau."
"Honestly, I'm a bit relieved. The decision is out of our hands. I was worried that we'd go and have to deal with 14 hours of mask wearing flights followed by a Hawaii trip with many things still closed or not fully open. Now it's done and we can make our own local plans. Just waiting for the airline and hotel to update their policies, so we can get refunds.And my wife is already starting to plan 2021. :)"
Thanks for posting this!Here's another news report:https:/…
"*sigh* Of course he did.In the meantime, the lieutenant governor keeps talking for the past month about his testing plan...and yet nothing still formally announced on that. If that alleged testing plan becomes a real thing, we won't be going...talked to a relative who we'll be traveling with for our upcoming trip next March. The relative said very bluntly, ""No way in **** am I paying for a lab test just to spend a week in Hawaii. It's not worth it. I don't want to go there THAT bad."" We agree. So we aren't going. It's frustrating. Maybe we'll go in a few years once the dust has settled."
"After I read about all the new cases in California, I understand. The islands don’t need that kind of uptick in cases."
"Thanks, Judy!We are already having spikes on Oahu....and soon those will spread as they visit other islands. Add the unknown spikes to come from the rallies all over-including huge ones on Oahu--and we can't possibly **safely** open to all without restrictions."
The lockdown in Hawaii started towards the end of March? I thought our trip to Oahu and Kaui in September would be safe. We are visiting my parents on Oahu and all 4 of us are going to Kaui. Now Im getting concerned. Is hawaii really able to sustain the loss of torusim past the end of july?
"Jyss, sustain it or not, it's where we will likely be. Who knows what the state will look like when it is all said and done. Many livelihoods are already gone. We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg on permanent closures.... September may be fine, but the island (Kauai) will not look like it did; it may not be able to deliver what visitors want that soon. Just MHO."
Incredible. Hawaii is going to be the new Andaman islands.
"I think the impact of tourism and the resulting infection rate/medical facility impact will far outweigh any permanent impact of no tourism.I make hotel reservations all day. People don’t get it. If they could, they’d be flocking to Hawaii in huge numbers. I explained the quarantine requirements to a man today THREE times and he still insisted that some exception needed to be made because he’s celebrating his daughter graduating. He was angry because the hotel was closed and couldn’t grasp that he would have to stay in his room for 2 weeks even if it was open. That’s the mentality, and that’s why the quarantine is extended.Edited: 12:39 am, June 11, 2020 "
"Considering the surge of cases in many parts of the US continent, I support this decision. It's good that he gave a little more advance warning so that travelers can get their refunds for July trips sorted out."
"I disagree, we not only bent the curve we stomped on it. Cases in the US are down, death rate is down. It will continue to go down and is likely starting to burn itself out soon if it's not already doing so. It's already clinically gone in Italy; they have a variant with a deletion in its genome quite similar to what we saw in SARS and MERS before those disappeared. Despite lots of folks being 'positive' they have little to no viral particles. RNA genomes are inherently unstable and that is the CCP virus's future. That's also why we we'll never have a vaccine by way of current tech. Consider this and the fact that virtually nobody in the US actually has or has had the virus to date! We'll look back at this as a giant over reaction where the only arguable course of action was to keep grandma and grandpa at home.Edited: 1:04 am, June 11, 2020 "
"As many Mainland States have begun ""opening up"", it's clear that there is an increase in Covid-19 cases. And it's the honest truth, that testing is on a small percentage of the population.I'm not sure that the claim that we've stomped this thing to death is completely accurate!"
Thanks for this update. We canceled our lodging weeks ago and we felt it likely wouldn't really be safe to travel in July and thought it was a long shot that things would re open by then. Now to convince our airline that we should have the cost of the tickets available for use past next Feb. which is their current stance. I'm very sorry for the financial impact this is having on all the islands. Much aloha to those stuck trying to get through this - keep your eyes on the horizon!
Next announcement: Molokai will host quarantine. Just like old times.
Down the on the isolated region JoeJax. And Father Damien will be the overseer! :( One can only get there by mule!
Just curious - we've decided to rebook for next March but my wife swore she heard on CNN yesterday that Hawaii may consider enacting the quarantine again during the winter - can anyone confirm or deny? I couldn't find anything online
"Our plans for this year is shot, I am not sure about 2021. Now, I need to wait for my flights to be cancelled, so, that, I can get a refund.Edited: 8:54 am, June 11, 2020 "
">>>my wife swore she heard on CNN yesterday that Hawaii may consider enacting the quarantine again during the winter - can anyone confirm or deny?<<<I haven't heard that, but I would not make any plans for HI in the future. I think their leadership is incredibly unstable and unreliable. I wouldn't plan to go to HI until it is clear there will not be any more quarantines."
"Bellken,Understood but you could always do as many folks have and just change reservations to other states that ARE open and welcoming tourists. We have done that, my sister has done that (both of us for no cost in changes). She had reservations for Hawaii for this week (several weeks actually), she swapped everything over to Hilton Head SC for the same weeks and is now on vacation enjoying herself. She has been to Hawaii several times but this was her first trip to Hilton Head and now has a NEW Favorite place instead of Hawaii.My point is, just swap your plans for another tourist destination that is open and welcoming tourists.You may get a pleasant surprise and find a new favorite place."
"Scott,Agree 100%.The leadership is just so wishy washy. We ALL KNOW there is more virus coming.To stick your head in the sand and not want to face it is just crazy. DEAL with it and start your economy back up. Oh, I know, you and your cronies are still getting paychecks but to heck with all the other Hawaii families.Man up governor and STOP destroying your states economy."
"Thomas R - quoting from your earlier ranting....""Consider this and the fact that virtually nobody in the US actually has or has had the virus to date! ""Do what ?Edited: 9:48 am, June 11, 2020 "
How to single handily destroy the Hawaiian economy book written by gov ige the “idiot” on sale now. Hurry supplies will not last. Unreal what this guys is doing but hey what do you expect from a Democrat. Looks like Hawaii will become an economic wasteland so sad..
"lol...comparing Hilton Head to Hawaii. Grief.I've been to HH 5-10 times. I hate that place. Water is brown and murky. No breeze. Humidity makes you want to kill yourself. Oh and the mosquitoes. Have fun, I guess."
"Pretty unlikely he can extend past July 31 because that is when the $600 ends. Also, they get revenue from May in the next few days, which represents business in April. They are in for a major shock.So I guess what I am saying is no one cares when you will NOT be open, we want to hear when you will be open. Disneyland announced a plan for mid July. Still a long time away but at least they have a plan. Give the hotels and airlines a chance to deliver safety."
"Scott, you sound so bitter. I think you need to find something that will make you happy. Go dwell on one good thing today that will bring an inward feeling of well being. Then go share a smile with someone."
"I know some won’t agree but I feel terrible for folks like Stewart, Sue and others who have to be feeling an incredible financial strain with all short term rentals shut down for a minimum of four months. I get both sides of the issue but selfishly can’t wait to get back to paradise."
"Thanks - it is a strain, but so far we are weathering it. It will depend how long this lasts to know how bad it will end up being. Six months of mortgage payments deferral helps, but HOA fees, insurance, and property taxes don't stop. As I have stated before, Hawaii's government is between a rock and a hard place here, but I hope that they are using the quarantine time to build capabilities to manage some form of reopening. Case rates are indeed rising in 21 states (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states is a good source). Where I live in Texas, we've had three straight days of record numbers of hospitalizations and other states like Arizona are looking worse by the day, so opening definitely is risky. However, continued loss of tax revenue and higher social service costs are also risky. There will need to be a plan to allow people to feel safe going to and being on island or none of this is going to matter."
Great Decision!Arizona opened too early and the CV-19 cases are now spiking from out of state tourist.
"# 22- so much easier said than done. We own timeshares in HI, and there are not comparable properties on the mainland, or dates available."
"This article is rife with inaccuracies. The first sentence says it will be extended until the end of June. C'mon man. The statement that CA has had a spike (or increase) is false. Numbers in CA have averaged right around 2k/day for the last month and the last 14 days have shown a moderate downward trend. Yes Wednesday was higher than Tuesday but everything is higher than Saturday and Sunday when they report less. Further the increased identification of cases is directly linked to the fact that today CA is performing 5X the number of tests they did daily, just a month ago. 90% of the cases are asymptomatic and being discovered as the economy re-opens and employers are performing their own mandatory testing. And seeing fearmongering posts about ""another quarantine"" just feeds into the anxiety.One poster pointed out - wait until July 31 when the enhanced Unemployment payments stop. That's when the heat will really get turned up and the politicians will fold - Newsom has already done it in CA - local officials are thumbing their noses at his statewide orders. When I hear people/reporters say ""well it's because of the virus"" I say no it's not - It's because elected officials have made poor fear-based decisions and have backed themselves in to a corner. More people have drowned this year in Maui than have died of Covid 19.2020 is going to go down in the history books as the biggest political and economic catastrophe of the 21st century. Our children are going to pay for it for a generation. I wish the people of the islands health and prosperity but I'm not sure you'll have either with Ige at the helm."
Has anyone asked all the essential persons allowed to work how many infections they got? Everyone could take the same precautions they do and go on with life. If CV-19 is so bad why are essential workers sacrificed?You know grocery clerks and home depot cashiers.  All this overreaction was based on the initial 2.5 million to die in USA predictions. Where has Ige been since? the moon?
"Mark P, I totally agree. Unfortunately many on this forum will never agree simply because they believe everything they're told. These decisions from the Governor will have many ripple affects still to be felt down the road.Although I have no financial stake in these Hawaii decisions but many of the ""locals"" on this site agree with what ever the Governor does and are simply not overly affected financially by these latest orders. I feel sorry for the people that are. No different than people on the mainland. California had/has the the same problem with Newsom.Easy to say keep the islands closed when it doesn't impact you. Still don't understand why Hawaii finds the need to keep itself quarantined/isolated when the other 49 states are opening up and willing to deal with spikes like everyone else. This virus isn't going away and at some point Hawaii will have to make some hard decisions."
I'm just a scientist so what do I know...
"As a percentage, almost nobody has had it. Math?"
"Mark - not sure where you are getting your numbers but https:/… https:/… https:/… all show California case rates increasing and https:/… shows multiple models projecting both further increases and a higher rate of increase in California.Clint - I am directly financially impacted by these decisions, and am now seeing at least four months of no income for a rental property with a high monthly carrying cost, but not reopening carefully will impact the state's long term economy (and my family's investment among many others). Hard decisions have already been made. More are coming. I'd love to see some reopening happening, but I am not so naive to think that there is an easy answer here nor am I so cynical to think that this is just a few people ignoring the wants and needs of others to further their agenda. For the long term health - economic and physical - of the islands we will need a range of tools beyond quarantines and masks to get through this."
"I'd rather live out my life without suffering effects of Covid than go 'on vacation'. Immunologists predict 100,000 additional deaths in the US, but that isn't counting the people who suffer for weeks in hospitals, isolate from their familes. We don't yet know how or when the virus can surface in people who are currently without serious symptoms. Oooh, it's such a hardship to stay home, wash your hands, wear a mask in public to protect yourself and those *other people*. Yes, we have a worldwide financial crisis, but why act in ways to make it last longer? Last message from Maui Kamaole says there are 30 condos occupied (of 316) with lower pool and spa open. Our guests who arrived in March are leaving today. They paid token rent and were happy to quarantine there. That may become an option for visitors again, just not YET! If you're miserable just because you can't visit Hawaii, I'm failing to understand your priorities. I AM sorry for all the tourist-dependent residents."
All these decisions need to be explained on what data they are basing them on. 1 active case followed by a spike of 4 is a 400% increase. Leave out the number and the 400% scares the scareable. So much more is known about this that the truly vulnerable can be protected while not forcing the 99.75% that won't get it or will recover fine to live.
"Well it was the 630 KCRA news here in Sacramento this morning Stewart. Maybe it was fake news. Saying people can't come to Hawaii from CA is like saying people can't come to San Diego from Los Angeles. I mean, yeah, I'm all for that for sure. But maybe people from San Diego can come to Hawaii but not people from LA or SF? Yeah, it's really that arbitrary that no one should accept."
"No one can come from,the mainland no matter where they live without quarantine. The way flights are now if you want to come from almost anywhere besides the west coast, you have to change flights on the west coast. If I wanted to fly to Colorado right now I would have to fly from here to Honolulu then to either SFO or LAX then to Denver. You all are singing the same song and not even a different tune. You all knew weeks ago June wasn't going to be the end of the quarantine. And the beat goes on and on and on."
"I don't know about KCRA radio since there isn't a radio station at 630 AM in Sacramento or a radio station with that call sign (https:/…Sacramento-CA), but KCRA TV https:/…32804212 - shows cases in California increasing. Maybe you were listening to KSTE 650?Anyway.... the quarantine is for all arrivals from out of state. I don't like it, but I understand why it is in place now and hope the state is working on a more sustainable approach."
"All I know is that as a visitor with a lot of dollars at stake, I can’t dither anymoreEverything is refundable for our August trip, so we are done and will move on to something else or maybe nothing at all and just enjoy being home, just see how the virus goes as there is so much more at stake then a vacation"
Gee did you think to look at the TV stations? - I promise I won't argue about what's going on in Texas if you won't argue with me about what's going on in California.
"Did you think to look at the TV stations? KCRA Channel 3 - I promise I won't tell you what's going on in TX if you won't tell me what's going on in CAEdited: 1:41 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"I think lots of people are making the same call. In bizarro 2020 I'd be packing for three weeks in Australia starting this weekend, everything has been cancelled and refunded with their quarantine and limits on international flights. I think more people voting with their wallets will change the calculation from minimize/eliminate all possibility of infection to managing the risks. We'll see."
"Yep John - we're doing the same. For what it's worth to the amazing DE's on this board and all those who love to visit and contribute, I'd be making the same comments if we were talking about Florida, Alaska, Texas or Colorado."
"Jtrue28,I guess you don't get to Hawaii much.You say it has No brown water, its always breezy, with no humidity and no mosquitos.You truly haven't been to Hawaii, those things are always there to the point they have ""brown water"" warnings, last summer according to the local folks was pretty humid with no breezes and there are plenty of mosquitos.Everybody is different. I know MANY people that absolutely HATE Hawaii and others that love it.To each their own. Point is that there are MANY OTHER GORGEOUS places for vacations, NOT just Hawaii.Maybe you would like the Keys better."
"Here's a good piece about the increases in cases since Memorial Day, in some places:https:/…Note that increased *testing* is mentioned several times--but so is a *higher percentage of positive results*. As for claims it's not real or hasn't affected anyone, here's a *happy* story about a 20 year old woman who nearly died:https:/…I haven't read or heard anything about a winter quarantine, Herfnerd. Perhaps it was a comment made about the expected timing of a second wave with the usual flu season? I doubt that would happen......but then again, who knew what would have happened all over the world in the last 6 months?"
"Tourists have options, as an owner I am losing money but not as much as the workers are losing. And if I could not afford a few bad months I would not own a unit. The ones I care about are the workers, they have no options.Our building is in total lock down to save costs, that is a lot of people without jobs. Many of the jobs are good jobs. managers, front desk, maintenance, valets, a lot more than just maids."
"People are making MORE on unemployment through July than they did working, in many cases. Yes, after July 31, it could be very hard. ........but there are places hiring too-esp. on Oahu. Thanks to the dropping of the interisland quarantine, I am sure the neighbor islands will see spikes after the 16th. Another 4 new cases on Oahu yesterday, and more to come-esp once the rally/protest attendees start getting sick."
People will be paying that unemployment back in spades in the future. Borrowing from the future to pay yourself now does not equal making more money. It's a mirage.
"Been to Hawaii many times Fran. Not one single time have we had brown water warnings. We don't go in the winter, so maybe that's our saving grace.Enjoy your trip!"
">>>Scott, you sound so bitter. I think you need to find something that will make you happy.<<<See you are wrong there. Nothing makes me happier than pointing out how corrupt Hawaii's government is, and has been for years. I get giggly when I point out how incompetent Hawaii's leaders are. You can hear me guffaw out loud when I point out how horrible the transparency and communication are from the Hawaiian leaders.>>>You all knew weeks ago June wasn't going to be the end of the quarantine.<<<Well since the governor didn't announce until yesterday that the quarantine would extend until July 31, I can't see how you can make that statement. Vague mumblings that you think you might extend the quarantine isn't the same as clear, transparent communication.I hope when all this is done, some enterprising reporter/watchdog in HI does a story on ""excess deaths"" in HI. The CDC tracks all deaths in U.S. and creates statistics on what deaths are expected, what actually happens and then if there is a big disparity looks at ""excess mortality"". How many Hawaiians will die or did die from delayed medical appointments and treatments? A delay in a couple of months in diagnosing and treating many diseases can lead to fatalities. Again, I hope someone looks back at the numbers and figures it out."
-This is the peter principle in action. I know people from NJ that say Hawaii is more corrupt. That says everything. It will be the next gov problem since no accountability for failures if you are elected.

"We have had a lot of stimulus so far, the $1200, $600, PPP loans and many of us have had huge CC refunds with canceled trips. It has helped everyone the last few months. But it will not last forever. With no guidance Ige is insuring August will be at minimal capacity at best even if he opens it up a few weeks in advance. I really do not see 50% capacity until after xmas. That will be a lot of hurt for the workers, as far as the state they need to come clean, they are not being honest with their budget numbers."
"We have had brown water happen in every month of the year :-). Rains from the mountains that flood gulches, like down south....or up NW near Honokohau. Then there are storm situations at any time of year as well, which can cause brown water. Then there are the sewage leaks in Kahului and Kihei......in other words, ""brown water"" has several sources/causes and happens on Maui regardless of time of year.The increases in hospitalizations in many states for the new(er) CV-19 cases are nothing to sneeze at. I think it's wonderful that recovery rates are rising in places--but that's mostly due to more knowledge and better understanding of how to treat people. Just a death rate going down doesn't mean much, just like a case number alone doesn't.As for any layoffs of County people, I'd be curious to see your source on that, John. The assertions sure don't agree with the budget and fund numbers, which have been published regularly. People need to look at more than what suits *their* narrative, whether it's the virus or economy issues.Edited: 3:18 pm, June 11, 2020 "

We even have a cure in HCQ at almost 100%. But vaccine makers aren't interested in saving lives due to their agenda and $$$$. Lockdowns and masks are not about health.

"I really don’t understand how requiring testing will be practical. We are due to visit from the U.K. at the end of August and while it looks like Trump’s Europe travel ban will be lifted by then, we won’t be able to get into Hawaii without getting tested if that system is being implemented by then. Even then, the traveller is apparently expected to foot the $120 bill for a test from CVS - I just can’t justify paying $600 for my family to be tested when a Hawaii vacation already costs so much money.Plus, what about people flying from the U.K. with only a short stopover in California who won’t have time to get a test done? Same goes for visitors from Japan, South Korea and Australia.With tests less than 70% accurate anyway, cases will spike in the islands regardless. COVID is going to be circulating for a long time now - we need to learn to live with it, not completely shut it out."
"Wow, Thomas and Karen Katherine - you can’t really believe all that nonsense, can you? My neighbor died of COVID in March. She was the same age as I am & she had a very similar job. This stuff isn’t just made up. If we had let it run wild with no restrictions we would all have friends, family and neighbors dead and dying. I’m not ok with that in order to attain some quick “herd immunity”. Are you?The virus isn’t going away. We will have to find ways to live with it. Live with it, not die with it. I love Hawaii, and I wish only the best for the lucky people who live there. We will be back whenever we won’t be a danger to the islands & going won’t be a danger to us. At least no more so that going about our everyday lives is dangerous. We have Maui plans for next summer, but I’m not counting on that."
kaukau. I was not aware of the Safe Travels program. Thanks for the link. Sounds uninviting. #70 mapped it out nicely. Even when the 14 day quarantine is lifted the program may continue to aid contact tracing. Add to that plans for facial recognition at HI airports. Yuck.
"Teri, it's not a matter of 'believing that nonsense', but instead a matter of 'having a high degree of certainty' given that I'm an expert in this area. I've been a bioinformatics scientist of over 25 years and developed the technology they use to 'read' the viral genome as well as a plethora of plain-old PCR tests and much much more. I made a ton of money doing so which how I wound up owning property in Maui. Initially shutting down made sense but not any more. In particular now that we have so much more data AND masks/ventilators. The cure is much worse than the disease and power hungry and manipulators are out of control. Don't believe everything the TV tells you. It'll be gone soon and is already weakening."
"If you haven't heard of bioinformatics here is an example displays just how much this virus has changed in a very short time period:https://nextstrain.org/ncov/globalAll of those 'dots' are mutations along it's genome.""There are thousands of complete genomes available now and this number increases by hundreds of every day. This visualization can only handle ~3000 genomes in a single view for performance and legibility reasons.""That means 1000s of different versions of this virus. The goal of a virus is to live in you and spread, not to kill you. Those that kill you are not 'tuned' yet. Eventually a relatively harmless balance is reached. The safer/friendlier out compete the more dangerous versions over time.All of those mutations you see are why I also think the idea that we're going to get a vaccine is a joke. By the time we get one it will have changed.Edited: 12:12 pm, June 12, 2020 "
VERY interesting! Thank you for sharing the link to the graphs.
"This is the friendly mutation I'm following/hoping spreads:https://www.sciencealert.com/yes-sars-cov-2-…""The Arizona study generated three full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from a series of samples; they found that one of these genomes, which they've named AZ-ASU2923, had a large deletion - 81 base pairs - in a gene called ORF7a.The ORF7a gene creates an accessory protein, which helps the virus infect, replicate and spread inside the human host. Specifically, the protein is thought to help the virus to evade our immune system and kill the cell once the replication process is complete."""

Taste is subjective. I think it's best not to be forgotten and humor is a great way to keep memories alive. Given the events we see on the street lately I'd say it's timely as well.

"Personally, I find nothing funny about the Nazi era and KarenKathryn's post, or Scott's. I think they are tacky and disruptive, **at best**.  I am not Jewish but have had many friends over my life who were, and I studied the psychology of the Nazis extensively as well. Mocking the massive crimes against humanity (not just Jewish people, remember), in light of what is rising again in America is even more ugly.People will believe what they want. But since Arizona is having some ""problems"" with CV-19, I think I'll stay in Hawaii and not visit KarenKathryn's state. Same for California.Keep your hate and ugliness with you.....please don't bring it to Hawaii. We don't need that infection anymore than COVID-19.SW"
"Anyone find any more information about allowed activities during the 14 day quarantine period? It says you can leave ""for medical emergencies"" - how would one get food?"
Patty:Here's the order: https://hidot.hawaii.gov/airports/files/2020…To your question: Delivered outside your door.
"There are several threads which detail what is allowed. Basically, NOTHING except medical care and departing the island.You cannot leave your room, to shop, walk, swim, drive around, etc., etc. You have to have all food delivered."
What if you are visiting a friend that lives in hawaii and will be staying in their home? My specific circumstance is that they are having surgery and I will be their caregiver during the recovery period.
"It makes no difference. And BTW, that would be an extra danger to your vulnerable friend."
">>>Anyone find any more information about allowed activities during the 14 day quarea tine?""Other allowed activities include: Playing Solitaire; Twiddling your thumbs; Staring at the ceiling; Counting to 1,209,600: The number of seconds in 14 days.: - )"
"I would like to be able to go and see may parents. As it stands they were supposed to come here to Nashville in April (which did not happen due to covid). We can't go there right now because of the quarantine and they can't come here because of the quarantine on the other side. We will live not seeing for a while but I'm getting concerned that our Sept trip will be cancelled due to the quarantine requirements. I can't just book a trip to the keys or something because the point of the trip is to see my parents. I really thought booking something at month six I would be safe. I don't know if its better for Hawaii to extend further or not. Its just frustrating. The travel restrictions at this point across the board are frustrating. As is having to cancel and re-cancel trips. At the end of the day Hawaii needs to do what is best for Hawaii.  To be fair we are not really the type of tourists hawaii wants as our hawaii trips really don't cost us much as we stay at my parents house, don't rent a car and eat way too much Yummys and L&L as those are what I miss about living in Hawaii. The plan for our Kaui part is to stay at Barking Sands but we will see! Unfortunately people cannot be trusted to maintain the quarantine or even wear masks here. We will abide by whatever rules hawaii has in place."
"Scott, when Hawaii officials come to your home at gunpoint and force you and your family on a plane to Hawaii then take you take a concentration camp and tattoo your wrist with a number then you may have a point. I find your comparison disgusting. All these years on TA together I had respect for you and your point of view. That is no longer true. You should be ashamed."

"So I'm assuming that in response to this latest directive, Hawaiian Airlines has cancelled their Trans-Pac flights through July 15, but not for the entire month. Previously they had been cancelled through June. I'm also assuming that, as they are on a bi-monthly pay schedule - 1st to 15th and 16th to 31st - that they are sandbagging the second half of July to see if the quarantine is pulled back a bit, as Lt. Gov. Josh Green and others have expressed as a possibility.What does this mean to us? Anyone ticketed prior to July 16th on HA Trans-Pac is now eligible for a refund. Anyone ticketed on HA from July 16th forward - and that's the two of us - is still in a wait and see."
"No, the increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations isn't the same as someone's tummy tuck. The stats are reported clearly and separately.I have seen plenty of the Nazi comments and find them all disgusting, and a dishonor to the 11 million who were killed. So should any ethical human being.......IMO.Jyss, I hope you can come visit your parents in late September. For you, it could be okay--as you say, you wouldn't be doing ""tourist things""."
">>>As far as the comparison to nazis....if you don't see that possibly coming then you haven't been paying attention.<<<KarenKathryn, Please don't compare a group like the Hawaii State Depart Of Transportation Airports Division to the Nazis. The Nazis worked too long and hard inserting pure evil into government to be compared to a group like the Hawaii State Department of Transportation Airports Division. Comparing the Hawaii State Department of Airports Division to the Nazis only serves to misrepresent the Hawaii State Department of Transportation Airports Divisionand understate the pure evil that was the Nazis."
"Jyss... a good example of the collateral pain caused by this, and you have a good attitude... I don't believe it's all about preserving lives... if that was the case there are a dozen things we could implement that would save millions to live longer... we are who we thought we weren't."
"There's a little link at the bottom of each post that reads ""Report inappropriate content."" I suggest that folks use it when they feel that inappropriate content has been posted."
"Since everyone's talking about Arizona, our governor, Doug Ducey, had a press conference yesterday, and this was the upshot: ""Arizona has also attracted national attention for its spike in cases, but Ducey blamed that on misinformation. He produced graphs showing that hospital and ICU bed capacity were around 75 percent occupied, but only around 15 percent of hospital beds and around 25 percent of ICU beds were being used by COVID-19 patients."" (https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/governo…)Hospitalizations are up, but our largest hospital system said that they ""had the necessary bed capacity and plans in place for surge capacity."" We flattened the curve here, and so far, I think our governor has done a good job reopening the state."
"Its just one of those things. Most of what we would be doing is open. The things that are not i suspect will be by then- like hanauma bay and the rec area the army runs in Wainae. Its most frustrating that I have had to cancel a trip to Austin, Japan, Germany and Maine so far with this and do not want to add another one to the list."

"I hear you, Jyss. Trip cancellations, especially in multiple, are frustrating and disappointing on so many levels. Many of us here are walking the same walk. And while some are gladly rebooking elsewhere, others (myself included) aren't ready or willing to just put our stock in another location. The bright side of course is that any one who has the resources to even deal with this issue is clearly in a far better position than many in this world. As far as not seeing your parents, that'd be an added downer, for sure. Again, you have a lot of company. People in my area can't genuinely be with loved ones who in some cases are only a few miles away, across the Canadian border. But late September is still a ways off; don't give up hope!~ Colleen"

"We decided to cancel again. We were supposed to go the first week of August. I doubt they will end the quarantine by then, but if they do we didn’t want to get tangled in the possible delay and confusion with possible testing.Airlines have been great, but my rental owner is denying refunds.

Forcing interstate travelers to quarantine on barges.3. Using facial recognition software on interstate travelers.4. Blocking interstate travel but opening it for foreign countries.Waaay out of bounds. All high level statist dictatorial ideas that have no place in our society."

I never said it was official policy but I have seen questions like that asked of our dear leaders and they didn't give a hell-no response like they should have. Beyond that, the science is solid. It will go away like a cold does. I was waiting for someone to tell me covid is mutating more slowly than influenza. They'd have an argument.I do have an agenda: Push back against tyranny and maybe in the process ease some people's minds.

Refund. After the misinformation this owner is spreading I would never rent there again. I will get zero if the quarantine is not extended. I only reached to to ask to cancel now to give the owner a better chance at finding an in state renter. The owner stated all of her other renters have been going or plan to go. I highly doubt that.
"I agree, it sounds like she was pressuring you for her own benefit. Very sad and yes---unethical as well."

"HNN has a segment on its ""This is Now"" category about Alaska's new procedure:https:/…This is pretty much what Hawaii is considering for Trans-Pacific arrivals in lieu of a quarantine."
"#98. ""The increase in hospitalizations is a lot due to procedures that had been on hold.""Accuracy of your assertion not withstanding, it does not matter. The point is not the reason for the increase. It is that the increase means there are fewer beds available for increasing numbers of patients.Nurse...would that be Registered Nurse?"
"People are surprised and aghast when differing opinions, or even facts, are posted at odds from those they are led to believe the majority agree with. They are true believers and don't see anything illegal or just wrong the way 99% of the population are treated. How many essential workers not on lock-down have died on Hawaii from Covid. Even with those massive spikes of 2 or 4 in a population of 1..5 million?"
"The Lt guv and his people (medical) estimate that the most Hawaii could handle is 30 cases a day........and that would presume that none were clustered on one island, but magically spread across the main islands in proportion to the medical facilities on each. It would also assume that most were mild to moderate. Obviously, that is kind of unrealistic, LOL. But--with 15 new cases today alone, on top of the spike over the last week (on Oahu)........it's not a good trend. We are getting around 500 tourists a day, give or take and depending on how you count. Some have become ill or arrived ill. That pattern can be expected to continue, yes? Look at the spikes on the mainland and the HUGE protests/rallies there, for days and days-weeks even. Many of those people will be asymptomatic and not even know they are ill until it's too late. There's a reason the ""pros"" are telling them all to go get tested.If we start getting thousands of tourists a day within the next 6 weeks or so, we will lose control of the virus and run out of medical space quickly. We will have a spike of deaths that could have been avoided for the most part, if not totally."
"This thread has become quite entertaining with the mud slinging back and forth and the passive-aggressive personal attacks.If the state can really only handle 30 new cases per day, then they might as well keep the entire state shut down for the next couple of years. Nobody in or out. Everyone will basically end up on public assistance or will move out of the state permanently."
"""If the state can really only handle 30 new cases per day, then they might as well keep the entire state shut down for the next couple of years.""Why? We have had wonderful numbers *for the most part* and waiting for a better test/process/quarantine until August or September is hardly forever. Waiting for the rallies/protests results to work their way out (so to speak), and to see how Alaska and other places do with the test/contact trace/limit quarantine isn't proposed for ""years"", but for two months-maybe less."
The state is very proactive. They were able to handle 30 last year too. So capability has been maintained. Seriously with a large number of the population in the high risk groups a serious governor would be ashamed.
"Here's a piece from HNN:https:/…Joe, I don't understand your remark. We didn't have any cases until March of 2020. As for the high risk population, well-every state has that. We are perhaps more protective of ours than some places :-)."
"Thanks, TA."
"Yikes, I heard last night that the cult of 21 people on the Big Island refused help to leave....they say they are moving to BI :-(.Yuck. That's the most polite thing I can say and that won't get me deleted, LOL. So far, they have chosen to stay in jail.Edited: 1:50 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"17 new cases on Oahu today. 2 required hospitalization.So, 15 new cases yesterday and 17 today. Those are on top of the increasing cases reported since June 4th. A total of 12 cases from Fri/Sat. are one family group. Bad news since their circle of contacts is likely very large.These are ""local"" cases. But they show how rapidly just a few cases can turn into a bunch. We have had more than 60 NEW cases in a little over a week. And let's not forget that any of these people might have infected many others before they became symptomatic.

">>>17 new cases on Oahu today. 2 required hospitalization. So, 15 new cases yesterday and 17 today. <<<It has been told to me that with the recent graduation festivities, friends and relatives from the mainland have flown to Hawaii for just one or two days to attend the parties, taking advantage of the cheap airfares, and have been able to ""legally quarantine"" for their two day visit at friends or relatives homes, and then return flight back.Could easily explain the contagion among families, and is a possible unforeseen ""loophole"" to having to quarantine for 14 days.I mean if your visit is just for one or two days at a friend's or relative's house, well, easy peasy, no quaranteensy."
"I wouldn't be surprised. I also wouldn't be surprised of some of them are from travel by a resident......ya' know, those cheap airfares. With Vegas open it will get worse.The loophole has always been there--and was worse when there wan't an interisland quarantine.Since some state (Nevada and Florida are 2) don't report visitor cases at all, even if people *know* they have it they aren't likely to say so when getting back to HI.Edited: 7:10 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"""I really, really don't like the dropping of the interisland quarantine this Tuesday now.........""Right? So upside down to open up to interisland travel at this point. From the DOH statement that kaukau posted on (I think) a different thread...“Even though cases have slowly risen in Oahu, I still think it’s time that we start to reopen the state,” Victorino said during the county’s news conference Friday. “I would like to see all of you have a chance to enjoy your family and friends from Neighbor Islands.""First, ""slowly risen""? Hardly. Second, who doesn't want to see everyone enjoy their family and friends? Who isn't yearning to hug their loved ones? That sentiment is simply not facing the situation at hand. How ironic to tout family gatherings when that is reportedly what gave rise to the surge in cases.Victorino's statement was made Friday. Perhaps he feels differently one day hence."

"We look forward to welcoming back our ohana, like yourself, as soon as possible. Good call on the Maui coffee. Thanks for your support!"
It should come to no surprise that once things started opening and people are moving around that there is a rise in cases. Dr. Green warned us this would happen. Dr.Fauci said on Friday that the numbers of cases rising isn't what one should look at but the percentages. Also the number of hospitalizations.
"Reb, sounds like a perfect mellow way to remember Maui! Enjoy and be glad you aren't traveling right now."
"Here's a good AP article about he issues with the tests that are available:https:/…Between the lack of reliability of tests, growing admissions about the incubation period, growing knowledge about asymptomatic carriers/spreaders, and more--like a spike and a half on Oahu already-I think opening is foolish."
"“Dr.Fauci said on Friday that the numbers of cases rising isn't what one should look at but the percentages. Also the number of hospitalizations.”We’re testing fewer people in Hawaii; the percentage of positives are obviously going up. As for hospitalizations, those lag positive results by a couple of weeks or longer.You can come from Kauai, but letting Honoluluians onto Maui is insane."
"But she has to fly to Oahu first. Then pick up a bunch of infectious people and THEN come to Maui.Oh, hip-hip-hooray."
"""The curve is increasing in 20 states that reopened. The U.S. doesnt take it seriously bc the president doesnt.""Because those states are doing more tests? Or a legit increase population wise?"
"Some of both. But places like Arizona are also seeing huge jumps in hospitalizations.......not just # of positive results.

Fishy- Could you please report back about your airport experience... how they are social distancing on the rental car monorail? When are you leaving for OGG? Have FUN!!--Lori
"Another 5 new cases, even though it's Sunday (very few labs report on Sundays). This time one on the BI and the other four on Oahu."
"Maui hasn't had a new case reported in about a month, IIRC. They added one older case to the total but no new infections have been confirmed.Since this started affecting Hawaii in early March, Maui has had 120 cases. So in 3 months, 120 total. Compare that to over 70 cases on Oahu since June 1st alone. I call that much more than a 'little' problem or surge or spike. Our mayor had said if there were spikes of 5-7 cases a day he would call to stop inbound flights without quarantine. Where are ya', Mayor Mike?????"
"Seems there is always a way to minimize this pandemic. What about the flu? It only impacts the old or infirm. The increase is only because there is more testing (which effectively argues that over the first couple of months this virus was worse than we thought...not reassuring).""Our mayor had said if there were spikes of 5-7 cases a day he would call to stop inbound flights without quarantine."" Was Victorino referencing Maui county? Or was it a statewide spike? Devil is in the details."
"Yes Lori I will let you know. I've been reading the Hawaiian Air web-site and watching the local news about airport operations that will happen starting Tuesday. Trying to keep on top of new procedures. Masks, hand sanitizer on the top of our packing list!! It will probably the most interesting trip I've ever taken for sure."
"Actually, as I think Sunny mentioned--tests have decreased overall in Hawaii over the last few weeks. Yes, they tested a bunch of people near the cluster on Oahu (all negative), but this isn't the more testing=more cases situation.I agree, the devil is in the details--and he *seemed * to be referring to the state, as it was phrased ""what would make you cut off interisland travel to Maui"".Maui is getting around 60-100 tourists a day. I don't think the airport tram will be crowded."

To everyone's dismay having more than one account on TA isn't against the guidelines. It hasn't been for a few years now. Since there are practically no employees left at TA I'm surprised there is any moderation at all!!
"At the end of a viewer entry COVID-19 Q & A session this morning on KITV4, Lt. Gov. Josh Green ended with a cryptic ""Important decisions will be coming later in the week...."" So stay tuned!"

I had my suspicions but dismissed them because I thought it was against the rules.Do you, or anybody, know how to determine which posters have multiple accounts? Happy to receive answers via open forum posts or via PM."
"Yeah, those accounts who haven't even made a review are dubious!"
"Sushi, great input. Maybe furball will weigh in."
"52 new cases in 5 days on Oahu...and today included a long term care facility. The resident is new. A staffer also tested positive, but it is not known whether the resident infected the staffer or the other way around."
"Interesting story here on the news. Our American border is closed but apparently people are ""getting around"" that by saying they're driving from the states and going through to Alaska. But that's just a load. One guy in Banff was stupid enough to brag to his waiter that they weren't in fact going to Alaska but just on vacation in Banff. He called the cops. Idiot."
"Missing, glad the waiter called the cops! It's crazy how many people believe the rules only apply to ""them"" not ""me"", isn't it? Or worse yet, those that flaunt flouting the rules.I am also tired of the people claiming they didn't know about the quarantine before landing in Hawaii. That's simply not possible and they are insulting people's intelligence to say that."
"Guess it is a tale of two citiesFriends on Maui Actually get out and about claim it is very quiet and not the hoards of non compliant tourists running around in droves that seems to be posted on here a lot, most of the cases seem to be community spread vs travelers Looking at YouTube videos Maui is a ghost town in all the tourist areas a friend who is a police officer said there really ins ‘t a real problem with tourists breaking the quarantine just some local hype that is anti tourism"
Those of us who work and drive all over every day really appreciate the lighter traffic :-).
"Not sure about the Canada-US border being closed exactly. I work for an international corp and we have regular shipments between borders. Probably closed for travel but not commerce.Traffic is bad everywhere. Traffic is bad in other locations due to businesses operating.We say tourists when speaking of Hawaii but isn't that really business?Edited: 2:26 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"You only hear about the ones that break quarantine John. Not the hundreds that actually are living it, abiding by the rules. Things will pick up now that we can fly interisland without quarantine. I'm looking forward to seeing Maui without the huge amount of visitors, it'll be interesting for sure!!"
"US-Canada border has stayed open to commerce and essential travel (whatever essential means, haven't looked into it). I think Hawaii needs to stay pretty restrictive unless they decide to change their Covid strategy. Many states in the US mainland have seen record infection rates and opening travel to and from mainland would probably cause a spike in Hawaii as well. Then there's the possibility of second wave showing up with northern hemisphere flu season and that would extend the quarantine even further. I'm not booking any travel anywhere at this point. Home renos are getting done though, but material shortages are becoming a bit of a problem."
"Yep, Olli--and those states scare the you know what out of us here. It's bad enough that we already have a spike on Oahu and today they all get to fly to the neighbor islands. Plus people flying to Maui are mostly having to go through Oahu if they are on Kaua'i or BI. Good for you for doing renos :-). We are running out of things off and on but that's 'normal'....though the grocery shelves are better than they have been for months. Still many pukas (holes) but at least you can find things in a week or so mostly."
"I know folks that are concerned but I don't know anyone that is scared. Can't wait to get to Maui. Yep, gotta go through HNL but that's the brakes. Masks, social distancing and hand sanitizer's are in our future and I'm willing to give really living a chance again. I'm glad families are finally going to be able to be together after a long separation."
"Well, I said:""those states scare the you know what out of us here.""I was talking about places like Arizona, Florida, Texas, etc. Last I checked, neither Kaua'i or Oahu are states, right?!"
"""Interesting story here on the news. Our American border is closed but apparently people are ""getting around"" that by saying they're driving from the states and going through to Alaska.""I find this very surprising , I wonder which border he crossed, given that US residents of Point Roberts aren't able to access the rest of Washington state via lower mainland BC, as per normal. (Not Hawaii related, obviously! Just following the rabbit trail. : ) )~ Colleen"
"Yesterday's Lt. Gov.'s Facebook white board infochat: Interisland travel going smoothly; date for opening up Trans-Pac travel T.B.D. ""We're working feverishly on that."" he said. : - )12% of the State's ventilators are in use, 52% of our I.C.U. beds are occupied. That last statistic is concerning with regards to increases in new cases.Again, he's hoping for decisions and announcements to be made in the near future.I don't see Gov. Ige ending the arrival quarantine until firm, proven, preventative measures are found and instituted. With that being said, a quarantine pull back to mid-July is doubtful, and an extension into August is not out of the question."
I hope that the Mayor is using this time to put his diversification plan in place
"And 18 more new cases today. All on Oahu, though they didn't say if 3 of them were residents or travelers.Yesterday, there were 4 new one on Oahu and one on the BI. The BI case and 2 of the Oahu ones required hospitalization.The next 3 weeks are going to be very ugly at this rate.Edited: 7:05 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Nah, that's nothing we'll be fine. We have so many vents in the US now we're shipping them out for free to other countries. If there is REALLY a concern maybe start putting up tent clinics? Those are cheap. CA and NY did that but wound up taking them down because the 'rush' never came, or at least not enough so that those facilities were needed. So they were taken down unused. Not to mention the hospital ships that were sent and not used. So far the only real abnormal death rate we've seen is NYC. (1) When Cuomo sent covid patients into old folks facilities for christ sake killing thousands. (2) Elmhurst https://www.youtube.com/watch…Warning: That video is quite disturbing."
We matched a record today! 92 in Kahului again!
Here's a good article about tourism and the different rules in different states. Interesting reading:https:/…

"Hey, Ducks! I happened to see your post before it was clicked out. Yes, I know that 92 is nothing to you desert dwelling people.....but as you also admitted, the humidity here on Maui can make that 92 feel much stickier and warmer :-).I can't put you up in my garage, but when you get a hotel room, let me know which one. I will deliver food and drink to your door, with Lolo along to make sure you don't try to escape quarantine. She's very, very fast, and takes her duties quite seriously!Your two weeks in isolation will fly. You can catch up on all those books and scientific papers you've been considering, watch endless reruns, watch old sports matches, eat, drink, and be ummm......well, eat and drink. I'll pass your good wishes on to the crew at MBC :-). Do bring the Black Amex card, okay? This will not be inexpensive.I would have recced that you do a cruise, to avoid airplanes-but I saw that all US cruise lines are cancelling through mid September now.Edited: 10:09 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"Go bother another forum, Christina SPAM."
"I read on Maui Bound on Facebook, that Ige, wants to keep Hawaii closed, until after the election....... so November? Anyone else heard this?--Lori"
"Why would he do that Lori, he's not up for re election he is term limited out. Anyway, these social media platforms are sooooo full of rumor crap and generally stray very far from reality. No, I haven't heard that!!"
"Ige is guv until 2022. He doesn't leave office till then.I have heard people trying to start that rumor, yes. Along with many more, as fish said."
"OK, Thank You ladies. I figured it was people trying to stir things up.--Lori"
"Lori, I think Maui Bound and some of the other ""move to Maui"" groups are getting crazy. I don't follow them, but have friends who do, just for giggles.Oh--the guv has said he ""expects"" to announce a 'major partner' in the new travel plans/procedures soon. No other details yet.I think he's prob going to get Hawaiian Airlines to subsidize pre-tests with CVS as well as post arrival tests. He's so deep in their pocket I wonder how he finds his way home.........but once in a while he makes them pay for all the patronage. Disclaimer::::: this is just my totally unscientific opinion!Edited: 6:50 pm, June 21, 2020 "
Standing by for further instructions!
"Just for fun, I checked airline prices today, for early November......... SKY HIGH! United and Southwest doubled in price since I last looked a month ago.... Hawaiian, out of Sacramento was the cheapest by $300.00 per person!! I wonder if the airlines know something we don't? Interestingly, United now requires we change planes in SFO and HNL, thats new... usually its non-stop from SFO! Also, they added a super early 6am departure from OGG, and we must change planes in HNL, and SFO.... we never have to go through HNL........ hence the higher price, airport tax?--Lori"
"Lori, direct island flights from further than the west coast are being done away with. 3 flights for me to get to Denver. I have to fly to HNL from here just to get to Maui!!"
"Lori, some of those *may* change, after the end of September--if demand is high enough. But I don't think any of the major airlines are in a gambling mood right now. Their bailout agreements end in Sept., so October on will be interesting.The airport tax isn't the reason. Nonstop flights just aren't worth them flying."
I laughed when anyone thought Southwest was actually going to bring low prices. That was 15 years ago. They are usually the highest unless you can travel midweek with 6 months notice.
"The guv is reportedly still considering Alaska's method of reducing/changing quarantine. Of course, he's been considering it for weeks now............but the Star Advertiser today says he's close to announcing something. Kind of like he's been close to announcing something for 10 days already :-((((."
Guv soon to unveil plans for easing Trans-Pac arrivals; Reaffirms plan to keep quarantine in place through July 31.https:/…
"I am really hoping for some good news on how testing could allow visitors back in. Our family has been planing, saving, for over one year. We booked our flights into OGG on July 30th and since two of the four flights were purchased with miles they will not allow us to rebook. =( Watching the news for updates like a hawk..."
"Aloha Izabella V. Welcome to TripAdvisor!Just like you, we have a quick trip out of OGG to Boston July 21, a trip to Las Vegas July 26, and another to Las Vegas in September, so just like you, we're watching the news for updates like a hawk as well!Good luck to us!"
"Izabella, what airline did you book with? I'd double check about points not being refundable. I used points with SWA to book some flights this summer, then got all the points back when I canceled the flights recently due to COVID. I know all airlines are different so YMMV..."
"how is it working in Alaska, any updates. I would guess anyone planning a trip would be extra careful the week before."
"Izabella, if you are planning to arrive on July 30, please note that you will be required to quarantine for the full 14 days. I suggest you cancel and re-book for next year."
"Oh just hold on......... why be a dream crasher? IF they lift the quarantine on July 31, they ""might"" let her in with a negative Covid test..... Wahine, please do not be so negative, this is a trip planning board. Mahalo, so much :) --LoriEdited: 6:31 am, June 24, 2020 "
"Thanks for the link!I think testing before leaving home is a great idea. Unfortunately most testing facilities are in short supply of testing kits, and are still following CDC guidelines, no symptoms, no test. Which leaves arriving to the island and rolling the dice. Guess we will wait to get the details from the Gov"
"""Wahine, please do not be so negative, this is a trip planning board.""Yes, and we try to offer trip planners the best and most accurate up-to-date information we have, rather than vague hopes that something different may happen. That's not being negative, that's being as helpful as possible.In any case, there is a definite possibility that the 14-day quarantine will be extended past July 31.Edited: 11:19 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"Izabella, it seems strange that the airline won't allow you to put the miles back in your account. I've done it twice since April with Alaska Airlines, and I've done it before on Hawaiian Air. What airline are you booked on?"
"""Ige on Monday reaffirmed his plans to keep the quarantine in place through July 31."" https:/…"
"Wahine: In any case, there is a definite possibility that the 14-day quarantine will be extended past July 31.Doubtful and Wishful thinking on your part:https:/…"
"They have to open by July 31, that is when the $600 ends"
The state is considering adding some bucks to the unemployment compensation to try to offset a little bit of the federal payment.
"Islandgirl from Nevada, please refrain from making assumptions about what I may or may not be wishing for. The article you linked includes the governor's confirmation that the 14-day quarantine will be continued until July 31, and with New York, New Jersey and Connecticut all now imposing 14-day quarantines for visitors from high-risk states, the trend appears to be towards more quarantine requirements rather than less. None of us can say what will or will not happen. This is a pandemic, and the virus is unpredictable, as are government officials' responses.If your version of helpfulness to the person wondering what to do is that she should risk all of her travel investment on the slim chance that she can come in on July 30 and not be required to quarantine, that's your perspective. I think she would much better served by trying to recoup her miles and reschedule her trip for a time when her travel is much more likely to be pleasant and relatively hassle-free."
"I don't think it's pono to say if she lands a day before, she can 'get away' with no quarantine kind of thing. As has been posted before--land during quarantine, quarantine. They aren't going to nod and wink. She shouldn't be led into thinking otherwise, IMO.As Wahine said, now that other states are actually *adding* quarantines, we have no reason to believe that Hawaii will totally drop ours. It MAY be relaxed IF they can get testing etc. in order--but people should understand that if they test positive, they will still have to quarantine for 14 days. That could be on arrival, or days later.....depending on what system they adopt.I realize people want to return to the happy days. Unfortunately, our new normal is much more what we will have for a long, long time. Personally, I would cancel any trips until maybe November."
"Aloha! We booked with AA. I am just waiting to see what the updates are this week to make our final decision. My main concern is not finding accommodation at the same rate I did a year ago. =( But, there are things I cannot control. I am going to continue to keep my hopes up, and will gladly get tested if need be. But, I do realize there is a concern for locals and residents that is past my own belly button. I really appreciate this space, because I had not heard of this possible change otherwise. I also read today that the DOJ is not too happy with this mainland travel ban. I am not sure if this will play a part in the decision."
"Well, I have been properly put in my place. I retract all comments, I blocked Wahine so she never has to see my post's again :)--Lori"
"The DOJ brief is off base. Here's a decent article about it:https:/…There is no doubt it was ""politically motivated""........as in ""file this or lose your job"".Again, if the quarantine is in effect the day you land---you will be quarantined for 14 days or until you leave, whichever comes first.(PS--Lori, I don't believe TA works that way:-). It's not like FB.....)Edited: 3:30 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Thank you all for your input! If the 14 days are in place and is not lifted, then we are def going to reconsider. I agree that it is not worth it...At this point we are only going if they are ok with us getting tested prior to leaving ."
"SW- I clicked on her profile, top right corner is 3 dots.... click on that, it drops down, Block Wahine... so I did it. Its worth a try! :) --Lori"
"But Lori, that only blocks her from sending you private messages.Anyways, Izabella, good luck and please understand that both Wahine and I aren't ""anti-tourist"". We are simply trying to help people see the different options, rules, and requirements."
"For giggles, I went to the block feature. This is what you are agreeing to when you block someone. Pay special attention to the last sentence. ""If you block xxxxx, they will no longer be able to:Follow you on TripadvisorSend you direct messagesRepost your contributionsTripadvisor is a public forum to post and share content. Blocking a user will not disable their ability to view your public content or your public profile page."""
"I think the block is you won't see her posts.The article doesn't even mention possible plan to allow non US residents.I thought politicians have teams of lawyers and constitutional scholars to refer too.Or maybe they just pull their ""Rules"" from somewhere else when they feel like.In the name of health of course or usually the children.Edited: 3:54 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"No, Joe...........on all counts."
"OK- Now I see why the Clicker's click so much! :) Oh well, Its my day to upset people who live Hawaii.Have a nice day, everyone.--Lori"
I wasn't upset...and I don't think anyone needs to be clicking or blocking. Peace.Here's a good piece from a doctor on Oahu about the failings we have been seeing here (and that some of us have been complaining about):https:/…
"The Gov, Josh, and all the Mayors are having a press conference at 5:30pm Hawaii time... Be there or be square :)--Lori"
"LOL! But it's 2:30 PM Hawaii time, not 5:30 (that's your time).Yeah, he's going to do another photo op at HNL. I'm sure Ingram (Hawaiian Airlines) will be at his side again.https:/…Edited: 6:03 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"LOL! First time I've been blocked on TripAdvisor forums! Just FYI, I can see every one of your posts, Islandgirl from Nevada :-) It would be great if all potential travelers embrace the fact that this is a fast-changing situation and most of us are doing our best trying to provide people with useful and factual responses to their questions. As SW said, advising someone that they may be able to ""get around"" the quarantine is not pono – or useful on any level. If the situation changes and the quarantine is lifted, our advice will change . . ."
"On August 1st, a pre-travel testing program:1. ****Valid NEGATIVE test 3 days before arrival equals No quarantine. Test results must be in hand.2. No Valid test equals 14 days quarantine.3. Temperature screens and if a 100.4 or more, they will be separated and given time in an air conditioned room before a second temp scan. They will also be offered a CV-19 test.These are the big points of the new policy effective August 1, 2020."
"Just received ""Urgent"" email from Hawaiian Airlines: ""Your flights on July 21 & 26 have been cancelled.""They got that out about 1 minute after the announcement.Eligible for full refund."
Good! Glad you get your money back again :-).
"Good summary, SW.I think the new policies sound fairly well thought out. It will still be somewhat challenging for prospective visitors, as they will have to gamble their pre-paid travel costs on the hope that they will not test positive for COVID-19 72 hours before their arrival in Hawaii. But many will be willing to do that.kaukau, excellent that you were able get a cancellation and your money back!Edited: 9:26 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Thanks for the update Akamai. Sadly, with a party of 9 and young kids; I am afraid we can't take any risks.I think we'll have to cancel our Mid August trip, any issues with us trying to get a full refund from timeshare rental?"
"Ha N, I think you need to contact your timeshare rental for that answer. And I would do it ASAP."
"Woohoo!!! Our Labor Day trip may actually happen.I’m perfectly happy to take the tests, now lets hope AMerican Airlines actually decides to fly us there and our villa gets opened up with enough facilities operating to make it worthwhile. At least its hopeful and something to possibly look forward to. Guess I had better start working off those pandemic pounds! I promise not to bring the virus with me but will bring some dollars to help out the local businesses."
Have fun planning poconolady. Hope it all works out well for you. We had a great time on Maui last week!!
"Thanks, SW.This is such a let down, this would be our first trip to Hawaii; and we're all looking forward to it. Perhaps next year.We just sent an email to the rental agency, Redweek. We'll try to call them tomorrow."
"I know it's disappointing, but by next year we will ALL have a much better handle on this beast. We will have better tests, procedures, and more. Travel will be different still-but not as nerve wracking as now. Your trip will be much more fun under those ""terms"" than now or in the next several months, IMO."
"Hello Everyone,I was able to get a refund of miles back on my account but ended up spending more miles to rebook and paid extra for the flight difference for the other two flights. =( A hit of around $200 bucks so far, and now need to change our car rental. We were lucky that the apartment rental was able to change the dates.Fingers crossed I am able to change my car rental!"
"Izabella, you should book your car rental through one of the *good* discount brokers. They don't require any prepayment. Try Costco, Autoslash, and DHCR.Edited: 7:24 pm, June 25, 2020 "
