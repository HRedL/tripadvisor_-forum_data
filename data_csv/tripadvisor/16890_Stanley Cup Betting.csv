Does anyone know about betting on Hockey games during the Stanley Cup? I have never tried sports betting (know a little about it) and was hoping to place a bet while I'm out there. How much do you have to bet in order to win a decent amount? Is it even worth betting on?
Bumping.........
"Money lines are generally used for hockey. For example the line might be:Team A: -200Team B: +170To wager on Team A (favorite), you would have to lay down $200 to win $100 (or $40 to win $20 etc..). To wager on Team B (underdog), you would lay down $100 to win $170. You can also bet on the series or do a prop bet on who will win the stanley cup."
"Just don't bet on Vancouver Canucks, or L.A. Kings to win the cup :)Been a while since I've done sports betting.....but I think it's $5 minimum, and $2 for horse racing. ......well, if you losing a lot of money at the casino, and need a ""cooling"" off period, you can put a $5 wager on a sporting event, and sit and watch a game for 3 hours.....and if you're lucky, the cocktail waitress MIGHT come and offer you a drink....tip her and enjoy the game."
"Hockey....What's that?Didn't it used to be some ancient Canadian ritual?Oh, that's right, it's on that obscure cable station between the replays of the 1994 Tour de France and ""Earthday Fun in Sedona""."
Thanks vt...that helps. It seems betting on the underdog is the way to go...provided they win :) 
Oh...and I'll be be betting on the Flyers...so no worries :)
"My bet is with the Wings. I do have a question, though. Where can you find out what the odds are if you aren't in Vegas at the present time? Just curious."

Calgary Flames.Yeeehawww!That is all :)Cooper
Go Devils!!!! 
Related statement: Conditions are favorable for a major Avalanche epidemic!!GO AVS!
"Manny and the Wings, all the way!!!!!!"
 I am on the Red Wings at 16-1 from before the start of the season. So come on Wings. Yzerman to lead them all the way.I have made a shed load throughout the season backing them -1.5 goals on the road. Go Wings!!
"The Avalanche Will take the cup again, so if ya wanna win put your money in them.. unless you want to lose your money..... but why would you do that???"
go jets go go jets go    
Mgm sports book is a good spot-by the way go habs.
"Go Sens Go!!!Go to the TI sportsbook, $5 min bet, free drinks while you watch your game."
"I've never been to the TI sports book, but MGM is my fav so far. And the bar has Pyramid Hefeweizen on Draft...so good."
Note: The best odds are at the Imperial Palace
"clyde---I agree...I recently(4-21) grabbed two what I call ""value"" bets on the Cup at the IP....Got Devils at 10:1 and Sharks at 22-1. I saw Sharks at CP and Bellagio books at 8-1 and it was 22-1 at IP.....I'm sure that Hockey doesn't get the action of other sports, so it really pays to shop around as odds can very greatly place to place, unlike with most other sports.BOTH DEVILS AND SHARKS STILL ALIVE!!!!!!!!!"
"Thanks for posting this topic. Since the Oil defeated the Wings (sorry Detroit fans) I will be in vegas next week and was hoping to place some bets and maybe catch a game at a sportsbook. I will be going with some Calgary fans so it would make it interesting if the Oilers and Flames play. I'll check out MGM or the TI. We are staying at the Alladin, does anyone know if they have a sportsbook there or if it's decent?Thanks"
"wearsy Congrats to your Oilers team. We in Detroit are a little stunned, but the best team has won in this series. Good luck with the rest of the series. I will be at the Aladdin in 9 days and I just my bet on the Oilers. "
"Thanks 1stewart20, It was a good series, The Oilers are playing some good hockey right now. I was a little surprised they got passed the wings but i guess anything can happen in the playoffs. You said your heading to the Alladin in 9 days the 11th of May? That's the day we as well are heading there as well, maybe I'll see you in the sportsbook cheering on the Oil!!!"
