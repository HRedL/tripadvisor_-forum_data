Is La Repubblica a decent source? https:/…
"Yes, Repubblica is a conservative newspaper of long standing. But it is not a major newspaper and as before I recommend that people refer to Corriere della Sera, the most substantial paper, based in Milan.

Transmission of the virus in Lombardy has occurred as in cluster infection places people have gone to Emergency and staff and patients have acquired the virus there."
"My strong impression is that La Repubblica tends to be more alarmist and sensational than Corriere della Sera. Nevertheless, they are both mainstream, respected news sources. I read both regularly."

"Brisby, thank you, see thishttps:/…and keep looking at it. I would use a mask anywhere around there and on a plane and as far as possible keep space from people. (A mask on a long journey from Australia helps keep moisture in, avoids drying out and respiratory irritation.)You don't say when you are traveling. Check with GP to see if they have any fluvax or pneumovax. Vaccination against the flu is not vaccination against COVID-19, but avoiding being sick is first step to avoiding a weakened immune system. In any case the winter flu season, though winding down, is not over in Italy.Edited: 4:47 pm, February 24, 2020 "

"Regarding the value of wearing masks, their is little evidence the kind of masks you can easily buy are effective in preventing airborn viral diseases. To work they have to be a certain kind and they have to fit perfectly, ie, no airleaks, and fit very tightly.That excludes any man with a beard and many people who have prominant cheekbones. That ""fit"" on the face is quite uncomfortable and too claustrophic for many people.The kind of mask that you see most people wearing: a typical surgical mask loosly tied onto the face, are useless. There have been many articles recently about the effectiveness of wearing a face mask: you can google it and read for yourself. The take home I got from reading one of those articles a week ago was that wearing gloves and frequent hand washing if you are not wearing gloves are much more effective than a mask."

"#41 Re:Gizmo link , they said “ Many public health experts have already criticized the travel restrictions implemented by countries like the U.S. For one, the fear and economic damage these restrictions create can unintentionally worsen the situation, making countries more reluctant to report cases within their own borders. They can also make people prejudiced toward the residents of affected countries or of their neighbors who hail from there.”. I read things like that and it infuriates me. I don’t care about that junk, I care about my families health, the health of people around me, and doing the best I can to make sure I don’t go somewhere and get quarantined.

"This afternoon, the Governor of the Lombardy Region (capital city Milan) announced that decisions will be made TOMORROW or SATURDAY concerning the restrictions currently in force within the Region to combat the spread of Coronavirus.It is quite possible that certain restrictions will be either modified or dropped. One restriction already dropped was the requirement to close all pubs, bars, cafes and night clubs at 6 p.m. These establishments may now remain open provided that the number of patrons be limited to the number of chairs at the location, and that all patrons be served at table and not while standing at the bar counter (which tends to get crowded). Pubs were closed in Lombardy Region for only TWO NIGHTS before the restriction was lifted.There is SPECULATION that MUSEUMS may reopen next week, perhaps with some restrictions on the influx of visitors to avoid congestion. I should point out that only the major museums have capacity/crowding issues. Many, many lesser known museums in Italy do not present problems of overcrowding, and it seems silly to keep them closed.Another statistic: of the 528 reported cases of contagion, only 37 require intensive care hospitalization (7%). While that number Is relatively low, it does represent a huge threat in the aggregate in a worst case scenario, because there are simply not enough hospital beds in the country to accommodate the huge numbers of patients which would materialize should the virus spread widely out of control. But this scenario may never occur, as we all hope."

Delta said unless Rome is added to the list of restricted destinations, there are no refunds. Trip insurance doesn't cover pandemics, so that's out of the question as well. We are in a holding pattern, hoping for the best. Anyone else experiencing this angst about their upcoming trip to Italy?"

Yes the computer offers tampon but there are two relevant and quite different meanings. First is the barriers around certain towns, second the swab, the pharyngeal swab for virus tests."
"Number to call if you are concerned about your symptoms or contact with virus [if you are in Italy]Throughout Italy people are being asked not to go to family doctor or hospital emergency department... but to make a phone call.The Veneto Region has a very clear page of advice on this. It gives a number to call which is specific for the Veneto region, other regions other numbers (I think). For other regions see region map linked from #43 above and elsewhere in this muddle links to specific regions.=====This is the Veneto regional government's advice.[google translation, using Chrome browser][there is a reference to 118, which is the national number for emergency]800462340. This is the toll-free number activated by the Veneto Region to assist and inform citizens on the behaviours to be taken by people who fear having come into contact with viruses.The decision was made in light of the fact that many people are calling 118 to inquire about the infection, to avoid overloading the operations centers, which can have consequences for rescuing people who actually need immediate intervention.It is also recommended to call 118 in case of breathing difficulties, to request the immediate sending of an ambulance.The technicians of the Region specify that people who fear having come into contact with infected subjects, but who have no symptoms or who have mild symptoms such as fever and / or cough without breathing difficulties, must not call 118 and must not go to Hospital; instead, they must contact the toll-free number which, based on the news reported, will provide all the information and any instructions on the behavior to be adopted. In addition, users can also request information and instructions from their general practitioner.The general practitioners of the Veneto region can be contacted by telephone by their clients who perceive symptoms, and who therefore do not have to go to the clinic. The doctor will perform a telephone triage and decide whether it is necessary to make a home visit or activate the intervention of the public hygiene service or the emergency-urgency system."

"I think the most important line in the CDC statement is this:""There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.""The same statement surely applies to other countries where this gets a grip.

"If you are looking at rising numbers of new confirmed cases of the virus in Italy, please realize that ""new"" cases at this point are being discovered because they are testing people in the ""hot zones"" at a much finer level. In the beginning, people only got tested if they fit a certain strict""profile"". Then of course they tested the immediate family if someone was :""positve"". But now they are testing many people just to map the virus, to see how many cases are in the area, etc. Some of the ""new"" cases are actually people who were infected quite some time ago, but didn't feel very sick, and the virus has yet to leave their body. The new numbers aren't in a new part of Italy, so it isn't ""spreading"" in huge numbers.Perhaps the most important number is how many cases are in the hospital. In Italy it appears about 20 percent, maybe a bit more. So that is 340 people or so. Since most of these people are in just one area of north Italy, that is quite a burden on those local hospitals.Edited: 7:39 pm, March 01, 2020 "

"Good morning Italian scientific researchers have made a very important discovery, namely the genetic mutation that made the corona virus dangerous for humans https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/mondo/corona…Google translatedAt the Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome, the genetic sequence that allowed the microorganism to pass from animals to human species was reconstructed.Italian scientists have managed to reconstruct the genetic mutation that has transformed animal coronavirus into a virus capable of affecting humans. The discovery is due to the group of medical statistics and molecular epidemiology of the Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome directed by Massimo Ciccozzi and the first author is a student, Domenico Benvenuto.Mutation occurred between 20 and 25 November - The study, accessible online and being published in the Journal of Clinical virology, examines the genetic sequences of the virus in circulation, discovering the mutation that was decisive for the so-called ""species jump"" "", that is the change that has allowed a virus typical of animals, in particular of bats, to become capable of attacking humans. ""It was a decisive change - explained Ciccozzi -, a very particular mutation, which took place between 20 and 25 November"".How viruses work - Like all viruses, even the SarsCoV2 coronavirus ""changes constantly and tries to change its appearance in order to be in balance with the host immune system,"" said the expert. After that of two structural proteins, the third mutation of the coronavirus was the decisive one: the surface protein called ""spike"" (tip, thorn) was transformed, which the virus uses to attack the cells and invade them to multiply.""Spike"" protein - ""It was the spike protein mutation that allowed the virus to make the leap in species - clarified Ciccozzi - It is a fairly conserved protein in the evolutionary history of the virus and this mutation has allowed it to the passage from animal to man, triggering the human epidemic ""."
"Just to add to understanding of the important news at #1109, SARSCov2 is the name of the virus, COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by this virus. Increased understanding of the virus means increased ability to work towards vaccine. While one company has suggested it may begin clinical trials in humans in April, understand the multiple stages of clinical trialshttps:/…phases.aspxWhile there is urgency we do not want something rushed out which is then found to have bad side effects.This underscores that the processes of containment are to delay, delay, delay as long as possible in hope that the thing just fails or for time to get a vaccine.Edited: 3:30 am, March 02, 2020 "
"I just read this from La Repubblica ""The councilor for Welfare of the Lombardia region - Giulio Gallera -- launched an appeal to all those over 65: ""It is true that the pathology is widespread but 50% have the virus without realizing it and 40% have no serious problems. But there is a 10% that ends up in intensive care, and they are almost all people who are over 65. So I invite the elderly to go out as little as possible in the next two / three weeks "" .This is sound advice not only to protect lives but also to protect the hospital system itself. One risk of such announcements is that it causes people in Lombardia who are over 65 to now go elsewhere in Italy -- to family in other regions, or to hotels in other places. Likewise, some elderly in Lombardia probably don't have 2/3 weeks of food, and relatives in other regions might come into Lombardia to deliver food to their relatves, and then go back home. Just a very tricky situation all around.Edited: 9:05 am, March 02, 2020 "

No doubt ..interesting to hear it straight from the firing lines...someone mentioned earlier only one case in NYC....I don't think too many are buying that....minimizing this is not going to help.
I read earlier this evening that screening of all air passengers on US bound flights departing from Italian airports will begin with 12 hours. I'm sorry I don't have a link.It is possible that all passengers arriving in the US from overseas destinations will be asked if they traveled in Italy at any point in their trip.
Why are posts being deleted en masse as above? The post was interesting quoting a doctor from NYC. What is going on with this forum?I heard the press conference where they said they would be implementing that protocol for DIRECT flights from Italy...however in the near future I think many people that are flying from Italy to US will be taking a connection in Europe as there are not going to be many flights. Hope they question them completely. And in a discussion after that press conf. it was discussed that not many cases are being caught at airports given the nature of this virus.
"Well, one of the deleted was my request that people take conversation into the conversation room, not continue here, to enable people to access the directives etc. I used a metaphor, suggested it be compared with stepping out for a cigarette or coffee, where most issues are advanced. Did not see the others before deleted. Life is like that in a world where people are free."

Educational tours have been suspended for the whole Spring.- public places (like markets, malls, pubs, bars, restaurants...) can decide to stay opened, but trying to avoid crowd. The best should be that everybody respect the distance of 1 meter each other, but is not strictly respected. Of course is possible that a restaurant stays closed for lack of clients...- museums and monuments could stay opened, respecting the rules to avoid crowd. For this reason is possible that sometimes you have to wait a little bit more than usual to enter. The most of public museums are opened. Some car museums decide to stay closed for the whole week (Ferrari, Enzo Ferrari and Lamborghini). Ducati museum decide to stay closed the whole month until the 3st of March.- Public events have been suspended (concert or similar). Cinemas and theaters could stay opened respecting the limit of the distance between people, so the most decide to close the whole week until 8th of March.- Trade fairs and exhibitions have been suspended: the most have been postponed on next months.At the end the citizens in Emilia are doing their life as usual.

"are you flying to the US non-stop from Italy?The US gov't indicated yesterday that ""screening"" of all air passengers (regardless of nationality) departing from Italy for US destinations would begin within 12 hours. The US gov't had previously stated it would screen all the passengers twice: Once before boarding the plane in Italy and once again upon arrival at the US sirport. But I have not seen news stories that this screening has begun. I am guessing that when it begins, if a passenger of any nationality shows symptoms of coronavirus infection, that passenger will be put into quarantine in Italy. If a passenger arriving in the US is showing symptoms of the virus, i would think that everyone on the plane would to into quarantine, or maybe they can travel onward if they contnue to do their own temperature checks,It has never been clear from anything I have read what happens to people who fly to the US from a non-Italian airport but who were in Italy during their trio.

"To be honest I don't think they have any plan in place so doubt anyone is going to be quarantined...at most they are suggesting ""self quarantine""."
"From Prevention.com:What happens during a coronavirus health screening?The screening is broken into two parts, according to the CDC: First, people will fill out a short questionnaire about their travel, any symptoms they might have, and their contact information. Then, CDC staff will take the temperature of each traveler with a hand-held thermometer that doesn’t touch the skin and observe the traveler for any signs of illness, like a cough or difficulty breathing.If someone is found to be sick, CDC officials will evaluate the individual further to see if they should be taken to a hospital for medical evaluation and to get care as needed. Currently, people who test positive for COVID-19 are being quarantined.If someone doesn’t have symptoms, CDC staff will give them health information cards. The cards tell travelers what symptoms to look out for, and what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days.“One of the key things the screening does is it gives the CDC and public health authorities time to educate the passenger about what to do if they get sick after they leave the airport, and alert them to the fact that they might be sick,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Securityhttps:/… The CDC link in the above article shows the protocol for China. The Italy Protocol is not yet specifically posted anywhere. But this article states that according to “CDC sources” the protocol it is as copied above which matches the protocol for Other parts of China outside of Hubei province. It does not say that whole plane is quarantined, just those found to be sick; others are asked to self monitor for 14 days. There appears to be no specific Italy protocol posted anywhere yet. But if they are not quarantining whole plane from China...It is still day one of new Italy screening so we may see more official guidance soon."

I hope everyone who flies will inform themselves ahead of time about how to protect oneself while using airport restrooms, airplane restrooms, while in one's seat, etc. Even if one doesn't particularly worry about being ill from the virus, it can be deadly to others if you spread it around.Edited: 6:31 am, March 04, 2020 "

It is contained in the 3 genetic sequences of the virus circulating in Lombardy, obtained by the group of Milan State University and Sacco Hospital, coordinated by Gianguglielmo Zehender, Claudia Balotta and Massimo Galli. The analysis of further genomes, in progress, will be able to provide more precise estimates of the virus's entry into Italy and possible ways of spreading.The genetic sequence shows the relationship with the viruses circulating in other European countries and confirms the origin from China.In fact, the first analysis showed that the coronavirus isolated from three people in Lombardy has strong analogies with the genetic sequences of the coronavirus of the first case found in Italy, that of the Chinese tourist hospitalized in the Spallanzani hospital in Rome with his wife, and of the patient one of Codogno, both obtained from the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) and the Celio Military Polyclinic of Rome.The analogies with viruses isolated in Europe are also strong, especially in Germany and Finland, and in Central and South America.

"Hi all.For those interested in how the recent Council of Ministers containment measures apply in relation to Puglia specifically and relating these to the day-to-day experience of life in Puglia, this thread from the Puglia forum might be helpful:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g187…It is updated regularly."
"""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big.But this is a time where we must take responsibility for ourselves.""Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.Ten days ago coronavirus was only just a topic of conversation here in Puglia. Something that people talked about in the local shops and in passing. Something to “think” about if planning a trip to the north of Italy, or abroad.We watched the stories about coronavirus on the news, heard about it on the radio and read about it in the press and on social media. But it didn’t feel like something that affected our daily life in Puglia.This morning we wake up to find that a quarter of Italy’s population - up to 16 million people - have been put in quarantine.After 1,200 new cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree placing the region of Lombardy, home to more than 10 million people and the financial capital, Milan, and 14 other provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice.People are unable to enter or leave, except for emergency access. Those who break the quarantine could face three months in jail. It is not a complete lockdown. Trains and planes can still run.Although the most recent restrictions do not (currently) apply to Puglia, we are now very much aware that Covid-19 is here.According to data issued by Italy’s Ministry of Health at 19:00 of 7 March 2020 we currently have 26 confirmed cases in Puglia. Two elderly patients - both with pre-existing health conditions - have died. People are starting to get concerned.Earlier in the week measures were issued by the Council of Ministers with the aim of containing the coronavirus. These included the closure of schools and universities nationwide. Social gatherings in public - and in private - where close contact of crowds was anticipated were banned.“Conferences, meetings, gatherings and social events, including cinema and theatrical events, held in any place, both public and private, which entail crowding of people such as not to allow the respect of the interpersonal safety distance of at least one meter, are suspended.”Sporting events, cinema and theatre most obviously, but also smaller gatherings were effectively restricted.Many social organisations have cancelled all events and meetings in order to comply with these requirements. Perhaps one of the most upsetting effects of the containment measures is that funeral services are restricted. In Italy funerals take place very quickly - often within 24 hours. Prayers are being said in private, families are unable to hold a public service.People with respiratory problems have been advised to stay at home, as have those over the age of 65.The decree even provides guidance to refrain from the traditional greeting of kissing on the cheek and hugging, to avoid crowded places and keep a distance of one to two metres from others.Friends in Bari are referring to feeling under house arrest - “arresti domiciliari” - even although today’s quarantine doesn’t apply to them.The psychological effect is starting to take its toll."

"Below is a Google Translate of the entire article linked in reply 251 on travel within Italy directed to Italian citizens. Thank you for the post Raffaele RPrime Minister Conte has just announced the new measures, summarized in the phrase ""I'm staying at home"". Stop sporting activities of all levels and gatherings even outdoorsYou may be interested in: chietitoday.it/cronaca/corona-virus-spostame…Coronavirus, ban on moving and schools closed until April 3: this is what the new decree provides""""No longer a red zone, but Italy a protected zone. I am about to sign a measure that can be summarized with I stay at home"". The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, said this a little while ago, live from Palazzo Chigi. ""It is the moment of responsibility - his appeal - you all have a responsibility with me"".The stringent rules established a few days ago for the areas of northern Italy most affected by the Coronavirus, therefore, now apply to all of Italy, including Abruzzo. The premier is about to sign the new Dpcm, which will become official tomorrow morning.Italian citizens will have to avoid travel on the whole territory of the Peninsula unless they are motivated by proven reasons of work, cases of necessity or health reasons. Assemblies are prohibited, even outdoors or outside of premises open to the public. ""We can no longer afford - said Conte - that become an opportunity for contagion"". You can self-certify the reason why you are moving, but a false declaration would expose you to a double crime: false self-certification and unjustified displacement. At the moment, the elimination of public transport is not foreseen.Sports events of all kinds are also suspended and gyms cannot be used for sports activities.From tomorrow, police checks are scheduled for those who leave home without work, health or necessity. There is no ban on leaving the house, but it will have to be done for work, health or subsistence needs (shopping for example). The Government, given the obvious non-compliance and the irresponsible behavior of many, runs for cover. Possible complaints against those who, like the sick, leave without reasons of necessity.The new decree automatically prolongs the suspension of teaching activities in schools and universities until April 3, while the previous one only provided for it until March 15.These are Conte's words: ""I know how difficult it is, but the numbers say that we are having an increase in the number of people infected. Therefore, our habits must be changed now: we must all give up something, for the good of Italy. And when I speak of Italy I speak of our loved ones, of our parents, of our grandparents. We must do it immediately and we will succeed only if we all collaborate and adapt immediately to these stricter rules. If public health is an asset endangered, we are forced to choose and impose sacrifices regarding other interests that deserve protection "".And again: ""I am forced to intervene even more decisively to protect all of us and especially the most fragile and most vulnerable people"".At the press conference, Prime Minister Conte had a thought for doctors, nurses and health professionals, for weeks ""in the trenches"" in the fight against Coronavirus: ""Today - he said - in taking these measures we must also think of them, who risk their own health to treat the health of others. The right decision today is to stay at home: our future, in Italy, is in our hands. Everyone must do our part. """"You may be interested in: chietitoday.it/cronaca/corona-virus-spostame…"

These are all proposals that we will make to the Government, solutions that we will submit to the evaluation of the Executive"".

"In observing the Italian prime minister some background may be useful.At the last national elections in 2018, the ruling leftish coalition lost out as did the Berlusconi party and a government was formed by the Five Star Movement and La Lega [the League]. https:/…2018_Italian_general_electionI wrote this, as an outsider, in 2018…blogspot.com/2018/10/a-perspective-on-curre…The parliamentary leaders of those parties did not want to be prime minister but Guiseppe Conte, a professor of private law with no parliamentary experience, accepted the challengehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_ConteIn 2019 the differences between La Lega and Cinque Stelle led to a collapse of their coalition, a new governing coalition formed between Cinque Stelle and the leftish Democratic Party, with Conte still prime minister. La Lega now in opposition and in collaboration with the Berlusconioni and Fratelli d'Italia [Brothers of Italy]. the latter direct heir to the Fascist Party.In regional elections La Lega has maintained government of much of the north but not Emilia Romagna. This meant lots of sniping between those regions and the national government. That pattern seems to have declined very recently with the urgency of issues and necessity of collaboration... and a rise in support for Conte himself.Just to note that where we of the Anglo world tend to scoff at the instability of governments in Italy, a major factor is in the Italian constitution. in the ferocity of demands for democracy post WW2, the constitution for the new republic went further than other democratic constitutions in allowing a government to be brought down not just by vote of confidence in the lower house (as in UK, Canada, Australia) but by vote of either house. These countries, unlike the US, have parliamentary systems where governments are formed, prime ministers appointed, on the basis of control of the parliament."
"Patient One, the 38YO man from Codogno is finally out of intensive carehttps://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/sono…Google translated""Am I in Lodi?"" Patient 1 speaks, just after leaving the ICUThe manager's words, the first to test positive for coronavirus in Italy. His wife, 8 months pregnant, returned home after hospitalization in the Sack and is waiting to give birth to a baby girl""Excude me, where am I, am I in Lodi?"". These are the first question asked by patient 1, the 38-year-old athlete and runner, immediately after waking up in the intensive care unit. The man first appeared at the Codogno hospital on the afternoon of February 18, without however having the symptoms that could have led to identifying him as a 'suspicious' case. So much so that after the necessary investigations and treatments, despite the proposed hospitalization, he had decided to go home.The hospitalization - A few hours later, however, the situation had precipitated, to the point of requiring, on the morning of February 20, the intervention of the resuscitator and an intensive care unit. It was his wife who had informed the doctors that her husband had been having dinner with some friends at the end of January, including one who had just returned from China. The swab and the discovery of the first case in Lombardy had been arranged before the explosion of the 'epidemic."
"Fanpage has published on Youtube a visit to and interview with senior staff of the resuscitation unit of a leading Milan hospital. The movie is here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjYLuKT7keEI have made a rough translation of what they say, which contains some repetition. Transcript begins:Resuscitation ward of the St Paul Hospital in Milan.Here all the patients have the corona virus, there are no other diseases being treated here.The mortality of patients brought to me is 20-30%The particular thing about this disease is that it lasts a long time.Anyone can be at risk of infection.No one can enter here.It’s extremely dramatic for a person dying, because they truly die alone.We only have corona virus patients who have breathing problems, brought into this protected environment, arriving sedated. They arrive sleeping and are intubated to have mechanical assistance with their breathing.We have been tossed into this tumultuous situation, everyone is closed out, we concentrate on the problem of infection from SARS-Cov2 [the name of the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, aka corona virus] This is something dramatic and violent. We dominate all existing health facilities. Lombardy definitely has an optimal health system but this epidemic does not stop, everything is inadequate.We have been working without a break since 22 February and we are wrung out.We get sick, we lack beds, we lack people. Above all we lack nursing staff.In the first phase the patient is in general anaesthesia, no feeling, no sight, not speaking, totally dependent on this ventilation machine that has become famous. We support basic life functions to allow time for the battle against this infection. An infection not just locally in the lungs but extending into other organs. Gaining time for the organism to recover itself, because no treatment exists. The system is clogged because the the number of resuscitation posts is limited.20-30% mortality, they were people in good health, predominantly male with high blood pressure.Data we have received and our own local experience indicate that any individual can be at risk of infection. The level of psychological suffering correlates to the impossibility of seeing anyone from family. Because no one can come in and this is a dramatic thing fo the person dying. They die alone. We are collapsing a bit because it’s now three weeks; every now and then someone collapses.end transcriptA few hours ago Fanpage published an interview with a manufacturer of resuscitation units based in Bologna. In this fast talking interview he said that hitherto most of his resuscitation machines were exported. He has now been directed to double production and export none.Edited: 4:22 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"""Because no one can come in and this is a dramatic thing fo the person dying. They die alone.""Thank you DennisThe video you shared provides a real estimate of the severity of the problem.Very touching"
That video and transcript made me really sad. I wish more people could understand how their desire to travel without respect for other's welfare can end so sadly for those who become infected and especially those who die alone.

Thank you Vagabonda..In the meantime I had produced a blog page with some comments on the sections of the paper.https://italiainsensoorario.blogspot.com/202…This information will be of relevance anywhere. Especially as and when we have more updates to observe trends. But already risk categories are evident.I note that in these papers the data are only for a proportion of the deceased persons17 March 355 of 2003 deceased20 March 481/3200
It should prove to be an informative collective blog/study. Impressive that you've already updated the blog with the 20 March entry.Vagabonda
"I remain indebted to you Vagabonda for telling me of its existence! I had been to the ISS site and not found anything when beginning writing that blog entry. I have every sympathy for health staff everywhere trying to maintain information, the back office situation. For many the information on preexisting disease risk will be unwelcome. For me not so much. In any case identifying level of risk should drive people to be safe. If anyone else finds a paper later than 20 March on deceased persons please send a link.....Just to add... using blogger is so easy, simpler and more rewarding than Word, and easy to update.Edited: 8:27 pm, March 24, 2020 "

"Understood, Raffaele. However my concern is not with actual full numbers but the documents that tell us which people die and why. To understand that is to give people a clearer understanding of risk than simply “old people” or “sick people.“ So far we have reports dated 17 and 20 March. Links in earlier messages and herehttps://italiainsensoorario.blogspot.com/202…The box on that page at your link…arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0… that is very important and good news is “incremento giornaliero degli attualmenti positivi “. The daily number of positive tests. That has been declining since 21 March. From about 4800 to 3500. I cannot find a number for daily testing, perhaps you or GAC have it. The percentage of positives is probably more important than just the number. My 9pm. Buona notte! Spero che tutti riescono dormire bene. I hope everyone is getting good sleep. Most important."

It means this week we hope to see the inversion of tendency, meaning our sacrifice to stay at home (18 days by now) wasn't in vainhttps://www.ilmessaggero.it/salute/focus/cor…Google translatedCoronavirus, for Fabrizio Nicastro, one of the experts of the 'Covid-19 numerical and statistical data analysis group', the peak is very close, and the situation is dominated by 3 regions. The peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy, therefore, would be ""very close"" and appears ""very wide, a sort of plateau"", said Fabrizio Nicastro, of the National Institute of Astrophysics (INAF) and among the experts of the Group numerical analysis and statistical data Covid-19 '. This is the situation so far, dominated by Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna. ""If another important region explodes - he noted - it is clear that the curve will rise again""."
"There is another line of research, in the UK.This suggests that in Italy, UK and other places a large number of people have been infected from before officially known, leading to the prospect that there may be a large 'herd' of people who have had the disease without report and are now perhaps immune. But there are still high risks. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…https:/…https:/…global_cfr_estimates.htmlChina has now closed its borders to foreigners, to defend against a second wave.In Africa we will see turmoil. A friend in Uganda has written to me about lack of either water or soap.Wherever we are the need is for continuing vigilance and social distancing."
"A new paper on deaths to 24 Marchhttps:/…Report-COVID-2019_24_marzo_eng.pdfThere are some minor variations from the papers of 17 and 20 March. But generally same pattern, same higher risk with age, if male, and with a particular pattern of pre-existing conditions. As before the most common symptoms at the beginning are fever and breathing difficulty [Dyspnoea] then less significantly, cough. So the pattern of who is most at risk is clear. To protect those people at risk it is important that people who are less at risk follow rules and reduce spread of disease. There may be prospect of plateau but not if there is risky behaviour, your country or mine.

The eventuality to die for the virus, if someone is in good or normal health conditions, is statistically low. It increases exponentially if you have no access to adequate cures.Thus, President Mattarella's words were not aimed to German people, but to EU Institution, mainly banks and financial world, always reluctant to intervene in defense of weak economies. They want to cope the financial situation with old instruments, non adequate for the contingent situation that need new financial instruments.Luckly, Italian economy is not weak.

Those production chains where spacing between workers with a mask obligation can be guaranteed could be involved. Certain manufacturing sectors such as mechanics, construction and trade (where possible) could fall. At the same time, two criteria could be considered. The first: those of the geographical areas, giving priority to the opening of those areas where the coronavirus has done less contagions. The second: age, with the elderly and more fragile people who will remain under protection."

"Good morningIn Italy the lockdown exit has partially begun although it won't be the same for every Region.https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cronaca/202…Google translated (excerpt)Coronavirus, here are the activities that start again todayThe Regions in no particular order: Veneto opens to jogging but from Lombardy to Campania the bookstores are still closedIt is not yet Phase 2, but it is at least the first shy step of a new beginning. Therefore, between gels and masks, bookstores, stationery shops and clothing stores for children, they reopen their doors, with all the necessary precautions. But this is not the case throughout Italy. Not a few regions - with a babel of ordinances - have decided to maintain the strong restrictions of the lockdown, while others have instead begun to loosen the meshes of the prohibitions in the wake of the now stable, if not slightly decreasing, data of the contagions from coronavirus.And it is not excluded that next week other sectors of industry, such as fashion, auto or metallurgy, may also restart, even if the head of the Civil Protection, Angelo Borrelli, calls for calm. ""At the moment - he said yesterday - these are premature hypotheses"". In a country still armored also on the mobility front - with the limitations confirmed on Sunday by the Ministry of Transport on air, car, rail and maritime traffic - from today, therefore, a slow recovery will be attempted."

No events, closed bars, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, museums, pubs and discos. Places of worship are open but no masses or funerals. Transfers from where you are are prohibited, transfers to the second holiday homes are strictly prohibited. Parks and playgrounds remain closed, as is confirmed by the stop for all sports activities, even the training of professionals. Motor activity near home is allowed, alone and keeping distance.STRICT ON THE ENTRANCES, STOP TO THOSE WHO HAVE FEVER Confirmed the rules on entry into the country and on short transits from abroad: those who return will have the obligation of fiduciary isolation even in the absence of symptoms. It is possible to move for work for a maximum of 5 days (72 hours extendable by 48). More stringent rules, in both cases, on departure from abroad: a declaration must be given to the carriers (with the reason for the trip, the address of where you will be in isolation and with which private vehicle you get there), which will have to measure the temperature and block the journey of those with fever. Stop confirmed for cruise ships with passengers and Italian flag. For those still traveling, at the time of disembarkation, Italian passengers who live in Italy are subject to 14 days of quarantine in their home, which they will reach only by proven means. Foreigners (of origin and residing outside Italy) are immediately transferred abroad, by plane or car, at the owner's expense."
"Here are a few ipothesys on how we will have to go on the beach this summer. Plenty plexiglass everywhere.I believe air conditioning will have to be a must without sea breeze circulation under the umbrellas. Generally I don't comment news on paper but this is incrediblehttps://www.ilmessaggero.it/italia/coronavir…Google translatedCoronavirus, how we will go to the sea this summer: umbrellas three meters away and plexiglass wallsThree meters away between an umbrella and the other and then plexiglass barriers. Not only that: staggered access and technological sanitation of common areas. Here's what our beach holidays could be like this summer. At least judging by the first projects that beach clubs are working on. Already designed by some companies that have made themselves available to the categories of tourism by offering the same barriers that are installed in supermarkets to protect the checkouts. Not only umbrellas and deck chairs isolated from the plexiglass. For tour operators it is easy to foresee a flood of hygiene requirements: from staggered access to the beach, to the installation of dispensing sanitizers in bathrooms, bars, ex-common areas, showers. Without forgetting the need for masks to stay in the open air, the possibility of staggering access based on the age group and the compulsory booking before access to the bathing establishments."
"Message from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commissionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE4BhKZWdQQ"
"Is this private beaches, public beaches or both? I can only imagine the mass amount of plexiglass it would take to cover our local beaches here in Alabama. Not to mention the drunken idiots that end of destroying them. I am in prayer that there is a solution to this virus that doesn't compromise the safety of all, some, or even the few. I pray that as you all begin going back out, that it will be both safe and without an increase in virus cases. With Summer just around the corner, we all need this to be gone for the purpose of our sanity, but more importantly the financial stability of all of our countries."
"SabrinaPost #383 is only an hypotesys they are thinking about. A guy I know manages a beach establishment in Francavilla al Mare, where I go on summer. He told me yesterday he prefers to remain closed rather than build such a mess. We both agree there won't be anyone (tourist or local) willing to spend their holidays in a transparent oven exposed to the summer burning sun.On july and August under umbrellas or palms is as cool as the sea breeze can flow among them. If the plexiglass stops the air flow then the temperature is going to be more dangerous than the virus.I believe they will change their mind in the next few days, but it's only to my humble opinion."
"Raffaele, I agree that would be insane...No breeze....sun coming through the glass just right will bake anyone even on a cool day. Plus it would take away from the whole point of going to the beach which is to feel the breeze and enjoy the open area."
"Thank you Raffaele for all the updates. We have a family trip to Italy that we booked in Dec '19 (that I planned for over a year) to celebrate me and my wifes 15 year anniversary but we fear we'll have to cancel and rebook for next year, after a vaccine can be produced. In your humble opinion, do you think it would be worth going in July if travel restrictions are eased? Will restaurants be open? Will beaches be allowing tourists? I greatly appreciate you keeping us updated and I check your posts daily."
"Hi DavidThank you for your post. I am afraid none can say what will be in July. I have no data to say. I am here to report what I see from within Italy but they don't ask my opinion on future steps.I was watching news on TV only a few minutes before I read your message. The speaker was telling there is a strong political and imprenditorial pressure to reopen activities but the experts are denying. The speaker said that even if some activities will reopen, we will have to cohabit with the virus. It means to wear gloves and masks plus social distancing for who knows how long for.I don't really know what the situation will be in Italy in the next weeks or months to allow again to go to the restaurant or in other non essential places.In my humble opinion, until all this mess will not be resolved worldwide I believe will be difficult to plan an holiday outside of own Country.I can only suggest to stay tuned. When things will begin to get better, if not me someone will tell here"
"Thanks for your quick response. I'll stay tuned to your updates from inside Italy. We have a drop dead date of May 20 on if we're going or not, giving us time to get some deposits refunded and hopefully airfare refunds as well. If all else fails, we'll rebook it all for next summer when the threat will be hopefully gone and the world economy back up and running at full speed. Best wishes to you and your family!"

Subsequently, from 27 April and until 3 May the return of other workers will continue progressively with an increase of a further 5% of the employed. By May Fincantieri expects a return to normalcy and full employment.As far as Electrolux is concerned, the Porcia plant in Pordenone will start working again on Monday after reaching an agreement between the company and the unions for a health protocol that includes the use of the thermoscanner at the entrance, delivery of masks, constant sanitization of the rooms, flexibility in the absences and a wide range of individual permits, especially for family reasons.On Monday, however, only the preliminary services to the actual reopening which is scheduled for Wednesday will be activated. Electrolux's 5 production sites in Italy (4,600 employees) which have been closed since 23 March represent around a quarter of its European production volume.""The company is preparing for reopening and it is essential that we in the household appliance industry - with the greatest attention to the health and safety of our employees - gradually resume production.

At the Lido Bacino Grande in Porto Cesareo, in fact, some tests are underway that allow tourists to go to the beach in total safety.

One in 20 blood donors (i.e. 4.6%) had already developed Covid-19 antibodies before the outbreak began. The percentage then rose to 7.1% in early April. A study by the Polyclinic of Milan indicates this. ""Social distancing - reads - would have helped above all to protect the youngest"".This is the ""first real scientific confirmation that in the metropolitan area there was a flood of infected people, even before the first cases of full-blown disease occurred.

At the beginning of the epidemic, seroprevalence was in 4.6% of donors, that is, 1 in 20 people had already come into contact with coronavirus.During the social distancing there was an increase of up to 7.1%. ""The purpose of this study - Daniele Prati comments - was to examine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic adults in one of the most affected Italian areas, and at the same time collect as many elements as possible to understand the factors of risk and laboratory values ​​associated with the disease. ""The practice of social distancing seems to have favored especially the younger ones, who have had time to develop long-term immunity. Changes in blood cell count and lipid profile occurred in all donors, who showed positivity to the virus: two clues that, according to the researchers, could help to better frame asymptomatic people, that is, those who despite having the circulating viruses (and therefore contagious) do not manifest the disease."

"June 3rd, 2020. End of lockdown in Italy.But it is not a global reopening. Here is what we can and still cannot do.https:/…Google translatedJune 3, what can (and cannot) be done with the total reopening. Boccia: ""Freedom of movement without conditions, even in Sardinia""""Freedom of movement without conditions"". So Minister Francesco Boccia summarizes the news of the last stage of Phase 2: in fact, from Wednesday it will be possible to circulate throughout Italy. Regional borders - including those of the worst affected territories - reopen without any order to the contrary. The governor of Sardinia, Christian Solinas, also takes a step back after a long arm wrestling with the Milanese mayor Sala on the possible introduction of medical passports. Except then propose a more flexible system, based on the registration of arrivals and the compilation of a questionnaire. ""Solinas has no longer placed a preliminary condition - announces Boccia on Rai1 - is working with all the others on mechanisms that allow to strengthen territorial prevention"". The main news is that from Wednesday self-certification will no longer be needed - except for certain areas that require it by local ordinances - because the move will no longer need to be motivated.Travel to and from abroad - From today, those arriving in our country from abroad will no longer have the obligation to spend a period of quarantine. In theory, travel to and from EU Member States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Monaco is permitted. But in fact not all European countries reopen the borders immediately (like Austria, which is waiting for June 15) or reopen them with a quarantine obligation for those arriving from certain areas of Northern Italy (such as Greece).Trains - In view of the reopening of interregional travel, Trenitalia announces that body temperature will be detected. Restoration also on board but with the delivery ""in place"" of packaged food and drinks.Cars and motorbikes - You can only travel together in a car if you are already living together, otherwise a maximum of 2 people will be allowed, both with a mask: the driver and a single passenger in the rear seat, on the opposite side. Alone even on a motorbike, except for 'hosting' those who live in the same house on the seat. Except in Liguria, where you can give anyone a ride, but only with a full helmet and mask.What is forbidden - In general, the recommendations made so far apply: no kisses and hugs between non-cohabiting people, no gatherings or crowded groups. So you can meet at dinner only as long as you respect the distance. For parties - public or private - you have to wait. As well as for the reopening of cinemas and theaters (scheduled for June 15). Still no national date for clubs and discos. The quarantine obligation remains for those with a temperature above 37.5: commercial and local businesses can prevent entry."
"Hi, not sure this was mentioned before somewhere but I find this a good official covid-19 statussalute.gov.it/portale/…and these good official FAQs about travel to Italyhttps://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…I would also like to mention that, if you are traveling to Sardinia, there is a requirement to register. You must register online on the Sardinia Region website (I am afraid Italian language only...)https:/…init (don't forget to print your receipt)or you must have an app installed (""Sardegna Sicura"") and register on it. The app is now available for Apple iOS and it seems still to be released for Android.Have your app registration or receipt of your online registration with you before boarding a flight or a ferry to Sardinia. Sardinia covid-19 situation is a very good one and the registration is mainly to track eventual imported covid-19 cases"

"The self-declaration for for entry into Italy from abroad has been COMPLETELY reformulated:https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…The changes are driven, in part, by the latest round of ministerial decrees (August 12, 2020), as well as by an attempt to make the document more precise and easier to complete.The website of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs which provides official information on restrictions for entry into Italy from abroad now hyperlinks several documents:https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…BEWARE that the main document, titled ""Extracts from the decree of the president of the council of ministers dated August 7, 2020"" is extremely convoluted and difficult to follow. Having a legal background in statutory interpretation may be helpful.https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…This is the Decree of August 12, 2020 concerning arrivals into Italy from CROATIA, GREECE, MALTA and SPAIN:https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…"

"#409 LinAThere is an ""OBLIGATION"" to do one or the other. Those who arrive in Italy from the designated countries without COVID-19 test results should test at the airport where possible (especially if foreigners). Residents returning home in Italy can also elect to be tested at their local ASLs, within 48 hours of arrival. Everybody waiting for test results is supposed to self-quarantine (either at home in in their lodging). I have read that foreigners are being given testing priority at airports (since it is not practical for them to be tested at the local health boards), but in at least some cases (Milan airports of MXP and LIN), they are urged to make a reservation for the test on the website of the airport of arrival. Test results are not immediate, but are communicated by e-mail or by phone within 48 hours. Where possible, it is preferable to be tested no more than 72 hours PRIOR to arriving in Italy, in order to avoid being tested upon arrival, and having to quarantine while awaiting results.The self-isolation requirement is waived:""for anyone (regardless of nationality) transiting, by private means, through the Italian territory for a period not exceeding 36 hours, with the obligation, at the end of that period, to leave the national territory immediately or, failing that, to begin the period of surveillance and fiduciary isolation""https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…(see point 6.H.)As you plan to leave Italy within 24 hours of arrival, it's possible that the COVID-19 test will be waived in your case. You should explain the situation when you arrive at the airport (and if requested, show documentation that you will be departing the country within that time span).Edited: 8:48 am, August 20, 2020 "
"Thanks GAC, still not clear for many people who transit.How can you book an appointment if next day morning you leave the country? You will not be there for results.Even if tested on airport(Bergamo don’t test) you will not be there for the results.I see many that struggle with this now."
"In my mind, it makes no sense whatsoever to be tested if you are a transit passenger who will leave Italy within 36 hours of arrival. I think that this is the only sensible interpretation of the regulation, and I believe that this is implied (because the self-isolation requirement is expressly waived). Personally, I would not be concerned. You will be declaring your transit status on the self-declaration form."
Thanks! Hopefully the form allow us to add transit option.
"My interpretation of the Regulation is that you fall under Paragraph 6.H. of the self-declaration form. You are not ""entering into Italy from Greece, Malta, Croatia or Spain"" but are IN TRANSIT to a third country, and your stay in Italy will not exceed 36 hours. While I might be incorrect, I see no reason why you would be required to take a COVID-19 test when you are in transit through Italy, and will likely not be in Italy when the results of the test are communicated to you. (You could nevertheless voluntarily choose to take the test at the airport (if offered) if you think it might be of help to you in your future travels, but that could also create unnecessary confusion to your status as a TRANSIT passenger, and I personally would not do this).Have you posed your question to the Italian Embassy or Consulate in your country of residence?"
"Thanks again GAC.You explanation seems right, (although 36 hours is enough to affect other people). I will contact the embassy and report back to everyone in this situation.Thanks again."
Have any foreigners landed at Naples airport from Greece? Were you able to get a test ok at the airport and get the results in a reasonable time? Finding it hard to find somewhere to get a test in Greece with 72 hours of heading to Italy
"There was a news report yesterday (La Repubblica) of tests being conducted at the Naples Airport, with results communicated within 48 hours."
"Thanks GAC, really helpful"
"hi all,i hope i have this correcti want to fly from greece on a fri morning to milan then get another flight to the uk within a few hours,even though this in not a full connecting flight and not a direct transit ,as i would need to collect my luggage then rebook in on the 2nd flightam i right in saying i do not need to have a test on arrival and do not need to have one in greece 72 hrs before i arrive,all what part of the form would i need to fill in??E or Hhope i have this rightthank you"
"I believe that you fall under Paragraph 6.H) of the self-declaration form. You are NOT ""entering"" Italy, but are ""in transit"" through the country for a period under 36 hours. Even though it is not a ""direct"" connection, you will not be leaving the airport in Milan. As such, it makes absolutely no sense to have a COVID-19 test (unless you need it to re-enter the U.K.). https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…See also Article 6, Paragraph 7.b):https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…"
thanks for clarity GAC just what i was hoping.
"I have a question about flying to Italy from Greece too. If you're not an Italian citizen and you plan to leave the country with your own vehicle immediately after landing, can you walk out of the airport without any major complications? I think that's what the Italian website explaining the current restrictions says but I'd just like to get some confirmation that's really the case."
"#422I'm not sure I completely understand your question. As a passenger in transit through Italy, I don't believe that you are subject either to having a COVID-19 test taken, nor to a quarantine, as long as you exit Italy within 36 hours of your arrival. If you rent a car at the airport immediately upon landing and clearing passport control, what sort of ""problems"" do you envision? You will need to fill out the ""self-declaration"" noted that you are a passenger in transit."
