"Hello all,I was planning a few months in SE Asia (Oct - Dec) this year. I'm going alone so I want as little worrying as possible. I thought I'd just do cities (Hanoi, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Angkor Wat, Siem Reap, Yangon and then Cebu and Bohol in the Philippines) because I don't do well with anti malarials.I keep coming across news on 400% increase in Dengue, and an outbreak across SE Asian cities and the Philippines this year and it's giving me cold feet. Mosquitos adore me, I wear DEET but my skin reacts to it after a week, and I'm currently quite a bit underweight.Is it silly to be considering switching destination (more to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Kuala Lumpur) instead and going to SE Asia another year?Thanks for any advice."
Dengue Fever is prevalent throughout S E Asia as well as other parts of the World. In Thailand it depends which part of the country you are visiting and time of year. A Deet based repellant is recommended but because if it's effect on you I would consult your doctor to see if there is an effective non Deet based one.
The time of year would be end of October to end of December and the parts of Thailand would be Bangkok and Chiang Mai.
See this recent information and the further link from it https:/…dengue
"Not sure about 400 % increase, maybe just a 400 % in reporting and acknowledging."
"Thailand reported 57% fewer dengue cases in 2016 vs. 2015. In the first half of 2017, less than 30% of the number of cases reported for all of 2016 were recorded, indicating a further decline of cases."
"Sri Lanka has had a 400% increase this year, so I would avoid going there, it is also much higher risk than Thailand. Dengue is worse in the wet season, October is the wet season still in some of those countries."
"#5 .... that sounds about right ..... Phuket seems right up there in top 5 every year.""Thailand reported more than 60,000 dengue cases in 2016. This was preceded by 142,925 reported dengue fever cases, with 141 fatalities in 2015.""outbreaknewstoday.com/thailand-reports-19-de…2017 is doing much better:""Thailand reports 17,000 dengue cases in first half of 2017July 1, 2017  During the first half of 2017, Thailand has reported approximately 17,000 dengue cases, including 27 deaths, according to the Bureau of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health.Cases were reported in all 77 Thai provinces.Of the total, more than 9,200 cases were classified as dengue fever, 7,300 cases, including eight deaths were attributed to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome was reported in 223 people, accounting for 19 fatalities.Overall, the provinces with the highest rates of infection include Songkla, Pattalung, Pattani, ............

"#5 thanks, can you link to your source please?Edited: 3 years ago "
"#7 Thanks for replying to me Loki,I don't know why I'm seeing such discrepancies. Your 17,000 is a lot less than the 136,000 this source I'd seen cited: samuitimes.com/thailand-experiencing-largest…and it was in Hanoi the 400% increase was reported :english.vov.vn/society/dengue-fever-cases-in…Very strange"
Oh Samui Times. Think that is for 2013: news.trust.org//item/20131024100249-aqxivnot 2017
"To quote the President of the USA ""Samui Times - Fake News!"""
samuitimes just reprinted a 2013 article with a new date........very sad rag.
"Very misleading and poor reporting, no wonder people get the wrong information, they should have made it clear it was 2013. The clue was reference to 2012."
"I use Jaico every time I go to Thailand - it's a green and white roll on bottle which is sold in pharmacies. It does contain DEET, but only 20%, and you don't need to cover your whole body. I find if I wash it off as soon as I'm indoors I don't have any problems. It's the only thin which keeps me bite free. I've been in Singapore and Bangkok for the past few weeks and haven't had a single bite, which is definitely a record. I'm also taking garlic and vitamin B1 supplements which are supposed to help too. My mum is even more of a magnet than I am and the Jaico worked on her when she was in Bali earlier this year. A friend of mine swears by the Tiger Balm citronella patches but I've not been brave enough to try a new product yet!As others have said, mosquitos are all over SE Asia, even in HK once you leave the city (though I know not all countries have the dengue-carrying ones), so if you want to visit these places and avoid getting bitten, you'll just need to find a solution which works for you. Good luck, and have fun!"
"Dengue tends to be an urban disease since it spreads from person to person with the mosquitoes only acting as vector. There's more danger of getting it in heavily-populated cities or tourist resorts than out in the country or on a remote island. And the mosquitoes that carry it bite in the daytime, not, as many seem to think, only at dusk or at night."

"DodgerOnce again the link you have quoted ORIGINATED IN 2013 and is identical to the one previously quoted. The Samui Times for reasons best known to itself just keeps reprinting the article, which in itself quotes information that did not and still does not correspond with other more official and authoritative sources, and changing the date to make it appear it is current. The ""news""paper seems intent on alarming visitors to Thailand in general, Koh Samui and Ko Tao in particular. Despicable!!!"
Fake newsFake islandAppropriate really.
Koh Samui a Fake Island? Just a figment of millions of visitors' imagination then? Fake reply more like.
That article is from 2013.
