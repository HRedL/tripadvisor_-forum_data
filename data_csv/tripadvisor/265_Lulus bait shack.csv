Can anybody confirm if Lulu’s Bait shack is open or closed? We have a timeshare at Beachplace and love Lulu’s.
According to their web site it is closed until further notice due to covid-19
I did see that but have also heard they reopened. I’m looking for somebody who has actually recently been to the area.
I just got off the phone with Beach Place Administration and they said Lulu's has been closed since March 16th.I called out of curiousity and free telephone line.
I have been told that both Lulus and hooters at beach place will not be reopening.
"When I called yesterday, they told me Hooter's had just re-opened."
