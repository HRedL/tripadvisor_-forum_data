Now that my late August vacation has been canceled it's time to thing about traveling to San Diego later in the year assuming things are better. Where would you recommend a family of 4 stay (two teenage sons) during Christmas week.
Coronado Island at the Del is a very festive spot during the holidays.Hopefully the remodel will be done by then.Mission and Pacific Beach has condos and homes available to rent.If you want scenic upscale( before SARS-COV-2) then look into LA Jolla.Visit San Diego.org for good info
"Things will NOT be better by year end.The vaccination is being worked on and earliest forecast is sometime in 2021.I would just stay home, plan to do lots of local Christmas activities, and not travel.Make it an old fashioned Merry Christmas; watch Hallmark movies, bake cookies or other holiday treat.Its likely the governor will even require us to not have family and friends over for the holidays.Rates of this virus are going up, not down.Yes, its a sad year, but I would think local.Many events will be impacted this year. Not sure what San Diego will cancel, but things like Christmas in the Park and the Rose Parade have already been cancelled. its too early for any of to know what events will occur."
"Normally.....That is the condition on any bright prognostication for San Diego in Christmas. Because normalcy is by no means a certainty, then cancellable and fully refundable plans are called for. That would suggest using hotels over Airbnb or Vrbo given some problems in disengaging. Your choice of hotel would be dependent on a number of factors, not the least of which is budget. Other important factors are what you intend to see and do and how you intend to get around. The coast is still nice, but colder than in August.Normally, we would go to the San Diego Zoo and/or the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. We would take in the freebie attractions in Balboa Park. We would go to Old Town and dine in Casa de Reyes because of the music and its built in Epiphany ....aka Three Kings.....decor.But that is normally. And we have our interests, while you undoubtedly have your own."
"The way things are going, are you able to commit to a 14 day quarantine upon your return to NY? Because nothing is going California’s way right now. After everything NYers have endured why they want to jump back into the frying pan is beyond me. Just don’t commit any money that’s not refundable."
Thanks for all the replies. I stated in my first post assuming things are better. I realize Southern California is having problems and frankly even though New York is doing much better I wouldn't recommend traveling here now. But I am asking about 20 weeks from now.
"NYDan, no one knows what’s going to happen 20 weeks from now as the situation is very dynamic obviously. With that said you’re more than welcome to come to SD and personally I welcome travelers from other states. Just follow the local public health guidelines. I would look for a vacation rental in Mission Beach as opposed to a hotel but that’s just me. The poster in post #1 gave you some solid regions to look at. A lot of people here aren’t wearing masks and haven’t been since the pandemic began and are out and about everywhere. It looks as though there isn’t a pandemic actually with so many people out now as businesses have opened up."
"@ Blaze. The fact that people are ignoring their personal responsibility by not distancing or wearing masks is exactly why Cakifornia case count an d death counts are rising!,I wouldn't encourage folks to come and ignore the rules!,That just makes this disease last longer!I wonder what advice Dan would give me about traveling to NY!We Californians are on the most quarantine list if we want to fly into NY!"
"Riff, I've been wearing a mask since mid March and am proud to say that my teenage sons do too; we've been social distancing too, maybe this is why NY has improved. I wouldn't recommend you travel here now because museums and other indoor attractions are closed. However I wouldn't hesitate to plan for a winter vacation here (refundable of course). I figured California is just a few months behind and that things will get better by mid Autumn."
Well 16 weeks ago we were pretty cocky that we’d done everything right. Then our Governor took the lid off and look where we are now. Does anyone seriously think this cat can be put back in the bag? Look at the sky rocketing curve in CA and realize that we’re under very few limitations. People are congregating in larger groups than they should. That curve in CA is going to keep going up. We should go back to SIP. Don’t for a minute think this will be a happy Christmas.
"Riff, I definitely was not encouraging anyone to ignore the rules. Lol I’m simply pointing out that most people here that I’ve seen particularly in the beach communities aren’t wearing masks and are not socially distancing and that was not to justify that the OP should do the same. In fact, I advised the OP to follow the local health guidelines. With that said Americans are free to travel to any state but Alaska does do things differently. They require a negative Covid test within 72 hours of arrival. I’m not a doctor but it is my opinion that this virus will simply become a part of humanity indefinitely. All we can do is follow professional advice from health officials."
Not true about travel to Ny. They want you to quarantine forc14 days if you are from certain states on their list. California and Illinois arex2 of them. There are more
"I believe there are other NE states that require quarantine. For NY, there are about 30 states on their list although it changes as numbers do. When NY was in dire straits, FL banned NYers from entering. So, no, free travel between states hasn’t been the case during this pandemic. And I wish CA would follow suit."
"Oh ok I didn’t know we were referring to the past I was referring to the present. Interesting. Even though there are restrictions in certain states still Americans are free to travel to all states currently. Those travelers may have to quarantine on their own dime but they’re free to travel there.So, yes, American citizens are free to travel among different states currently."
Somehow I think a 14 day quarantine will act as a very effective ban on travel.
