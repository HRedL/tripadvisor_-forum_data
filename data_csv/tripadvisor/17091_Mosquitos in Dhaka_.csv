Does anyone know if the mosquitos are bad in Dhaka right now?
There are mosquitoes in dhaka but no sign of epidemic dengue or chikongunia. Still use mosquitoe repellant. Better safe than sorry
"It’s painful, that’s all, nothing else. Dengue & chikungunya breaks mostly in summer (so winter is safer). Haven’t heard anyone got Malaria in Dhaka. As the earlier post suggested use repellent or net."
I took some repellent sprays from UK and dont think they worked too well. Since its winter you can get away with winter gear to cover yourself.make sure you wear socks and if you end up in a mosquito net in your bed do a final check. Riding in cars is where you get bitten the most
"In room, there should have mosquito net or use spray. While walking use, use mosquito repellent ."
It's bad in the Summer not in Winter.
We have been in and out of Dhaka 4 times in the last 30 days and didn't see or feel any mosquitoes at all. It's the dry season now.
