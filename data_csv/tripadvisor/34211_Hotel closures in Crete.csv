Are all hotels closed in Crete now really till April 30 and if so will they be reopen as usual by may 4 as I'm ment to be staying at star beach village does anyone knoe
Nobody knows what will happen after the 30th. The situation now is as described in the other topic.
"Sonia. I think you need to sharpen your understanding of what is happening in Greece and accept that the situation is so fluid, no-one knows what May will bring.I suggest you read this article..https://realgreekexperiences.com/greece-coro…In addition, tourist hotels WILL BE CLOSED UNTIL THE END OF APRIL (at least).Edited: 7:01 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"To be brutal, Sonia - I just really can’t see it, I wouldn’t even give it a 00000000000.1% chance of April and May holidays going ahead anywhere in Greece. And that’s not even factoring in where we’ll be regarding our aviation situation in the UK at that point, let alone Greece’s. I made so many friends in Crete that I have kept in contact with, I personally couldn’t bare travelling there at this moment - the thought of putting some at risk isn’t even worth thinking about. The Greeks really look after us Brit’s and now’s the time to show them some compassion, as bad as it will be for their tourist industry, life preservation is ultimately of course paramount. Try not to panic as with the way it’s going I don’t think many people will miss out on refunds for their holidays - just don’t cancel yourself is key!"
"Definitely don't cancel even though we probably won't go and shouldn't anyway. Don't give them a chance to not pay refunds.If it came to insurance claims I'm not sure where I'd stand. We have annual cover but it expires before May and any new policy would exclude cover for Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)... Maybe the policy in place when we booked would be how we'd claim??I know someone who decided not to go on a cruise and they were going to lose a lot. It has since been cancelled and they are lucky that they will not be fully refunded despite already cancelling.I too think there is a slim chance of accommodation etc. being open for May and even flights into Greece for tourists, especially from the UK.Personally I'd have gone somewhere between our Jan trip and May but didn't even consider it because of this virus and how it might impact everyone.Maybe 2021 will be better."
I have booked to stay in an apartment at the end of April. Does anyone know if apartments will be affected as the hotels are?I still plan to go and will only cancel if the government website advises against travel. When you consider there are more case of the Corona Virus in the UK and Spain than in Greece it does not make sense to cancel this trip to Crete.
"#5 - Greece is bringing in these measures to discourage holidaymakers from other countries. Precisely because there are more cases in the likes of Spain/UK, they don't want people bringing COVID-19 in to Greece and spreading it among the local population."
"#Orpandop - the reason it would make sense not to go in that scenario is... if Crete has done well to contain the virus, why go out there and put them at further risk (of death!) if it is entirely avoidable?"
...and what are you going to do anyway since everything is shut down?I see also you are from Barcelona which is also currently in a lockdown and flights between Greece and Spain are going to stop.
"rtj70Manchester, United... Excellent point Definitely dont go but dont cancel . I went cancel my Lufthansa flight and lo and behold i was only entitled to 30 percent of the purchase price. Let them sort it out . We are not going now but let see if they give me a full refund."
"#5 orpandop - that is exactly why you should not travel. That is exactly why this is a global problem, ie the transient population we now have. The ""I'm all right jack philosophy"" is still prevalent amongst some. Others might regard it as irresponsible."
"#5. Even if you can still travel to Greece, all visitors from abroad must now self isolate for14 days. Suggest you read this.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…Edited: 9:43 am, March 16, 2020 "
Well they ent want to lose tourism either they could do thermal testing at airport and if u ent pass u can't enter I ent have it why should I be not allowed to go on holiday in kisses of
"Someone could have the virus and not have a temperature. The only accurate testing can take 24 to 48 hours to get a result.At the moment it looks like if you could even get to Greece you would spend the first 14 days in quarantine somewhere and the seasonal accommodation, restaurants, bars, etc. are all closed. So why visit?It is not for you to decide if you can go on holiday to Greece or not. They are currently saying we cannot and for good reason. Do you really want it so you could spread this virus.It would also be useful if you typed your response in a language such as English. And start following the news.Edited: 8:41 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"So let's take your scenario Sonia & only your scenario, forget about the current actualities.You fly & are then thermal tested at the destination airport (I assume you mean that airport as you say refuse entry). Unfortunately, you are the only person to test positive for covid19 or show possible warning symptoms & as per your own last post, are refused entry. Forget about what happens to you next but consider all the people that may have come in to contact with you & that will now have to self isolate or worse for a minimum of 14 days...your fellow passengers, crew, staff & passengers at the outgoing airport that may have been compromised by you, staff at the incoming airport. Will you be having that?Edited: 9:42 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"At this time is it 'seasonal hotels' which are closed, not all hotels. That point makes little difference to the fact that it is virtually impossible to move around in Greece for 2 weeks after arrival anyway."
"It is useful to ask Sonia, where does she come from? How many cases in her country? How does she know that she doesn't ""have"" that? Any test or just a hope? For young people it could be asymptomatic!How old is she?I think we are trying to persuade and explain simple things, common sense and scientific facts, to really young person. I assume she is about 20 years old.All these days she is asking the same thing again and again. Sonia, protect yourself, your parents, your grandparents, your community. In 2020, holidays is not the vital thing!!!!"
"I fully agree with Elena. I'm surprised that many people only think about not losing their holidays during this difficult situation.Edited: 4:22 am, March 17, 2020 "
"Sonia, you need to wise up and accept what is happening in the world, people are dying and losing their livelihoods, it's not all about you."
"I agree with all of the replies I should not travel and now with closure of hotels and accommodation why would I. The Greek Government has officially announced that from March 16th all visitors to Greece will be compulsory quaranteened for 14 days.Yet EasyJet and many tour companies such as Love Holidays continue to sell flights and holidays to the Greek Islands in the full knowledge of this quarantine.This is very dishonest and unethical of them, if not illegal."
@ orpandpopYou are posting exactly the same thing on multiple threads (6 times at least).This is against TA rules - it is 'spamming'.
I didn't say it was all about me actually I just wanted to know if there making safety precautions so people ent need to be rude and I'm not a child in a grown woman actually trying to find out facts about if it will be open and will it be safe to travel as I ent fancy losing my money that I paid and also ya answering like I have corona virus I just wanted to know
I come from London England in a big woman I was just asking so people ent need to be abrupt
"If I were you Sonia K, I'd assume you aren't going."
"SoniaIf you are a grown woman you should be more aware of what is happening around you and around the world.Your posts come across as extremely selfish Even as you typed your last post, Greece had already announced that anyone arriving in Greece had to self-isolate for 14 days.And just in case you haven't got the message yet:""As countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and border restrictions, the FCO advises British nationals against all but essential international travel. Any country or area may restrict travel without notice. ""https:/…travel-advice-novel-coronavirus"
