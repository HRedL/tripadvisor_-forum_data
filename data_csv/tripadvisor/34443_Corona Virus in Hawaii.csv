"Saw a story about the couple from Japan with the Corona Virus, who visited Several of the Hawaiian islands. What is the chances that this is going to impact summer vacations to Kauai?"
"The couple,was on Oahu and Maui. Old news. Personally I'm more worried about the flu that is going around right now than the new virus. There are folks cancelling their trips to Oahu. How it will affect Kauai at this point remains to be seen."
"https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g29220-…From the Maui forum, over 50 posts.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g29222-…And this one is from the Oahu forum, with close to 70 responses."
Anyone who tells you how it might impact summer vacations is just guessing. You'll find a lot of opinion and conjecture. What you won't find is anyone with a crystal ball.
"Won't the radiation from Fukashima kill the virus?Seriously, you travel you can be exposed to all kinds of bugs."
Well I can tell you I'm not going on a cruise or going to China within the next 3 months. Hawaii sure!!! The flu/broncitis is much more likely something I am going to get.

"My former neighbors sailed on POA last week. They had no issues, normal cleaning and other protocols were in place. I still think the bigger risk on the ships is Norovirus, along with general colds and flu. Wash your hands a lot and maybe bring some sanitizing wipes for the remote and such in your cabin and you should be fine.Edited: 4:23 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"I'm sure POA is just fine, but I still won't take a cruise. I am a walking petri dish."
"Thanks everyone for the feedback. I hope the Corona Virus will be on the decline, and not continuing to spread rapidly as we approach the summer months. I’m sure it would wreak havoc on Hawaii’s economy if there were massive cancellations, if there were major concerns during the summer months."
If it does not abate in summer it is going to wreak more than vacations.
Good point.
"Spent 3 days of my Kauai vacation last week in bed with fever. Came home to the mainland with bronchitis. Not novel coronavirus, but the damp, cool weather combined with all the people (airplane, poorly cleaned rental car, hotel room, restaurants, tour boat, etc) makes for a perfect storm of germ exposure, ughhhh."
"Cari, I’m sorry you got sick. It’s the worst anytime but extra awful when you travel. I just did a 3 night getaway close to home and spent my last night sick as a dog. It happens this time of year. Although one year in June I got bronchitis while on Kauai so maybe the time of year doesn’t matter, This evening on a Bay Area radio station they had a doctor on and she actually said viruses travel easier in dry air vs. humid. I wouldn’t even comment on your post but I just heard this info tonight and I was surprised to hear this. It’s been very dry in California so now I have my humidifier on. Planes are the worst though. I hope you feel better soon."
"I listened to our president and he said that it would be gone in a couple of months, I think he said April. I guess higher temperature is the key."
You believe what he says.
Just kill me now...this is just a slow painful death.
It is the airport and plane that will do us in. Or the supermarket or pharmacy line.
"23 million reported US cases this year, 280,000 hospitalizations, 16,000 deaths.Wait, that's influenza.Just some perspective. If you're not panicked over flu, you should rein in your worry about corona."
I thought the topic of this thread was about the Corona Virus?
"People get sick on vacation. I did one year arriving in Hawaii. It was a bummer for 10 days, but when one travels in the winter in cold and flu season it can happen. Remember that you probably infected a lot of people on the plane coming home so thanks. Take steps to prevent the spread of any virus. Wash your hands frequently for 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer, don't shake hands with people and if you feel sick stay away from other people."
Looks like there's going to be a press conference (remember those?) this afternoon. Let's see what he has to say today. It is a different day after all and the all wise and all knowing will let us in on the latest!!
Can we keep politics out of this ? It's nice to having a place to go these days without having to hear it. Let's keep this about Kauai.
"Why is the Hawaii forum the only US forum where people are freaking out and posting constantly about this virus?Looking at other major USA tourist destinations, I didn't see any."
Because Hawaii has many tourists from China. Little Rock AK not so much.
Amen Napa that was my point. ..
"Actually, Hawaii has very few tourists from China. Like in the single digits overall every year--around 1-3%.The reason there's so much panic/paranoia on the Hawaii forums is a lack of geography lessons for millions of people.......can't even count how many people think Japan is just a short ferry ride from Oahu. Or that China is a tad longer ride, maybe on a small plane. We have far fewer flights from ALL the affected countries/areas than cities like NY, LA, SF, Chicago, etc., etc.---esp neighbor islands.People need to research and do what is best for them, but only after doing *good* research."
"Actually there has been some posts on the San Francisco forum, people are worried about going to Chinatown etc. Which is silly because the people that live there can’t travel to Wuhan just like everybody else. Whenever I fly I wipe down the arm rests, video screen and tray table with travel size disinfectant clothes. If everyone did that think of how much cleaner the plan would be! Not perfect but better. The doctor that was on KGO radio last night said to keep the air vent above you on, it blows particles away supposedly."
"SC Oh that is such BS about keeping the air vent on. You get sick on planes by sneezing passengers and they are touching toilets, seat backs, door handles."
"Well that’s what the doctor said so might as well try it. Of course you can still get sick if you don’t wash your hands or people around you are sick. Sometimes you can’t help it but you can do your best to prevent it. Here’s some tips to avoid getting sick. One is to point the air vent towards your feet to keep the air around you circulating. https:/…Edited: 3:59 pm, February 26, 2020 "
The air vents just circulate air in the cabin. That guy up in 11C that keeps sneezing? Your air vent is pulling cabin air that's probably been up by him...
"Right Mike.... Its just recirculated disgusting air. I turn mine off. That dr is just pulling stuff out of his you know what. All you can when traveling is try to prevent germs. Wash hands, use sanitizer, don't touch your face, sneeze in your sleeve and best of all stay off a plane if you are sick. I lived my life on those petri dishes of a airline tube for many years and I know what circulates in those vents. its not pretty."
"Not according to the doc on the radio or this website. Terribly sorry I shared info I heard last night from a medical professional on ways to try and keep from getting sick on a plane. Don’t turn the air vent on if you don’t want to, if you like stagnant air enjoy! Here’s yet another article on why you should put it onhttps:/…3fampOr try the google."
"Just a little touchy, there..."
No just prefer to rely on professionals and studies vs. what someone on the internet thinks.
"Scincalifornia, I too would have presumed you're better off without the vents blowing on you. But I read that last link you gave and it's pretty convincing after explaining the actual airflow in a plane.Better yet, I might just start wearing a mask and play it safe."
"Thanks for linking that article scincalifornia. Since I only fly once or twice a year and never really though about it, I really had no clue about how airplane air was circulated. I learned something very useful today!!"
"Sorry, Napaguy, I agree this forum shouldn’t be political, but when someone puts down a respected and very knowledgeable member of this forum who’s sharing advice that’s certainly is more believable than the recent “medal of honor” recipient who says the Coronavirus is no worse than a common cold, and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to take down the guy who lives in the White House. Give me a break!! And, yes, Mike, I’m a little touchy, too and have been for the last three years! I’m posting while I still have the freedom to do so."
"Napa and fishdiva. You’re welcome. I actually have been doing the vent thing for a couple years when I looked up “ how not to get sick on a plane “ when we went to Greece. KGO radio had an infectious disease doctor on and besides the obvious things you do like washing your hands, the dr. mentioned using the vent. You don’t point it at your face but towards your lap so you don’t really notice it. Of course the nob is probably filthy so wipe those down too. Coming home I’m way less vigilant, but know one wants to get sick while on vacation."

"As of yesterday, according to the World Health Organization, there’s only been 53 cases in the entire US, and so far 0 deaths. Perspective."
"I think you're reading old news.....it's 60 cases as of yesterday........including the first ""unknown origin"" case (in California). That person is in serious condition."
Not old news. The WHO website. It’s updated report yesterday the 26th. Maybe they update in the morning and more cases came throughout the day? Idk. Just sharing info. :)
Most of the known cases have come off the cruise ship that had been docked in Japan. The unknown case is located close to where all the cruise ship people are in isolation. I am off on vacation soon to a country who has ZERO cases but yet my family who traveled earlier than me said when they went through customs they are taking everyones temps. So precaution is advised.
Agree 100% jebett. I will be taking precautions as well. Just not canceling our trip because of it. At least not at this stage. Keeping things in perspective :-)
I totally agree that people should be keeping this in perspective. I've been saying that for weeks now!
"""Because Hawaii has many tourists from China. Little Rock AK not so much.""Do you mean Little Rock, Arkansas?  Alaska has no such city.Edited: 3:09 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"""Actually there has been some posts on the San Francisco forum, people are worried about going to Chinatown etc. Which is silly because the people that live there can’t travel to Wuhan just like everybody else.""I checked back into the end of January. Didn't see any and haven't the other times I looked. (I suppose it's possible they get deleted quickly on that forum.)"
AR sorry... You knew what I meant.People were worried about going to Chinatown in SF the day the virus was announced when it was in China only. Oakland Chinatown is dead. No one wants to go there either even though there are zero cases.
"I booked a flight to Arizona last Friday for May . The only thing I did differently was buy trip insurance, just enough to cover the fee to put our points back in the our account. So if we have to cancel I save $150 or I’m out $50 if I don’t need the insurance, but it covers other mishaps as does our credit card. I normally wouldn’t if I’m staying in hotels and one state over from home. I think trip insurance to Kauai is a good idea all the time especially if you’re booking a condo that you can’t cancel 48 hours prior like a hotel. It’s relatively inexpensive for peace of mind. If we had the time I’d be on a plane to Kauai in May instead of Sedona in a hot minute! ( I’m sure Sedona will be lovely ).Edited: 6:27 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Interestingly here they are starting to encourage residents to have a 2 week supply of food/ water /medicine on the local news. Not so much in that they expect a huge outbreak, but concerns about the supply chain being disrupted if ports have to be temporarily closed or if shipping slows down.Ever since the news report there has been a run on water and toilet paper across the island chain. We were at Costco this morning and they had a 5-item per customer limit on those two items, first time I have seen those signs posted since we moved here 4 years ago. And there were a lot of people buying as much as they could!No panic, but definitely starting to see so e behavior changes here."
They are suggesting that for CA too.
"Updated communique from the State of Hawaii, Department of Health:""Impact in HawaiiThere have been no reported cases in Hawaii. The Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) continues to monitor the situation closely and is actively working to detect cases of COVID-19 as early as possible.Screening is being conducted at Honolulu International Airport by federal authorities, and any passengers identified as having travel history to China in the past 14 days will be asked to monitor their health at home with public health supervision.Two travelers from Japan who visited Maui from January 28 to February 3, and Oahu from February 3 to February 6, 2020 were later hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19. After extensive investigation by HDOH, no one has been identified as having had close contact with the travelers and subsequently becoming ill."""

"The first death in the US from the virus was just confirmed.......in King County, Washington."
The lady who unfortunately passed away in WA State was a sick individual in the first place. Even if she caught the regular flu or a common cold her immune system was so bad she could have died from that.
It was a man......not a woman............https://komonews.com/Trump got it wrong and many media outlets have yet to correct it. I guess they're scared to.
"Well I haven't listened to Mr Prez today. I was listening to CNN this morning and they said it was a woman. Doesn't matter to me if it was he or she honestly. Heres the facts about the flu. My MIL almost died last January of the regular old flu because she has a heart condtion. ""So far, 16,000 people have died and 280,000 people have been hospitalized during the 2019-2020 flu season, according to preliminary estimates from the CDC."""
"Easy, Jebett! I just didn't want the bad info to keep going :-). I saw the very early reports and then later where they said it was a woman. I just think it's very sad that the facts weren't straight and think it's disrespectful to the man's family.I agree that the ""regular"" flu is dangerous.......everyone does. This is too. Neither one is good for many people."
"Interesting interactive map of the spread of COVID-19. At the moment, no cases shown in Hawaii (are they testing yet?). https:/…I listened to immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci who stated and repeated that those who are most susceptible to a bad outcome with the virus are those who are ""elderly AND have other underlying medical conditions."" So if that doesn't describe you, and you are going to Hawaii, not mainland China or South Korea, have a nice vacation! But check the map again prior to departure. Things can and will change.I agree, the familiar old flu is more dangerous, but the danger doesn't register with people, while this subject is commanding everyone's attention. Mine, too, admittedly!P.S. the first time I looked at the map, there were exactly 86,000 confirmed cases. Now it shows 86,008. The numbers update very quickly.Edited: 6:23 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Yes, Hawaii is now testing."
https://news.yahoo.com/washington-woman-died…I read this earlier. Prez was told it was a woman in a debriefing.Very sorry to hear the man passed away. I hope this flu and Corona virus are soon things of the past.
Local Seattle news station said it was a woman. But it really doesn't matter. The hospital and media does not even want to give the name of the person for good reason.
And now I’ve seen reports it was a man. The media seems to be going back and forth on this. I think in cases like this they don’t want to give much detail as to the identity.
There is a second death and that was also a man. Both were in poor health.
"I didn't hear the 50 year old was in bad health. He was supposed to have been healthy from what I read?No, only trump and his people got the gender wrong. In the beginning Washington had it right. A man.Edited: 11:44 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"https:/…Both had ""underlying health issues"""
Thanks...I'd like to see more but I suspect we won't.
"There is no telling. We had our tickets for travel booked in November, and now we keep changing sectors because of the Corona virus. Finally our tickets got cancelled. However we are travelling to Dubai. My concern is sitting on the flight. Do you think I will be allowed Lysol aerosol on flight to spray on my seat and table? Also I came across some corona virus facts that could us.. its good knowledge to know... Corona Virus facts that may save you... good knowledgehttps://dausel.co/h4bk50"
"I leave on an overseas trip this afternoon. I am taking lysol wipes but I always take lysol wipes and I travel a lot. I am more concerned about getting someone's cold than corona virus of which there are none in the country I am traveling to. Live your life and Dubai is a fasinating city. Its HOT there. Hot at 7am, hot at 1pm and hot at 11pm."
"Have fun, Jebett!6 deaths now in Washington.....very sad. The nursing home seems to be the eye of the storm."
"Traveling at this point with the current situation is not a good idea for not only you and your family but for others. Travel can wait its not a necessity.Edited: 8:36 pm, March 14, 2020 "
So sorry to hear that. God Bless your state.
"That nursing home also had 50 out of 95 employees tested positive for the virus (so far, some tests awaiting verification) . As of today there are 568 confirmed cases in WA state."
"""Do you think I will be allowed Lysol aerosol on flight to spray on my seat and table? ""Just saw this above. NO WAY. You do know that aerosol cans are not allowed ? Just take the clorox wipes with you if you can find them. But you can be spraying aerosol cans inside the cabin."
"Here are the stats:World Population: 7,771,095,400 (and climbing quickly)Cases of Corona: 167,543Deaths: 6,455"
"Contrast that with the rate of deaths from influenza, which has been estimated at between 250,000 and 650,000 per year: https:/…"
"Many virologists are theorizing that this virus has actually been in the country for longer than thought and healthy individuals who contracted (and their doctors too) just wrote it off as the flu not knowing it was something worse.But we will never know the truth. Actually at this point NO one knows the full facts about this virus. They even admit they don't know that much about it because we haven't gone through all seasons with it and we really don't know the full extent of what it is or isn't capable of. So when an reporter on MSNBC tells you that 14-20% of us will die that's irresponsible. This is the kind of thing that creates the panic. By all means, do whatever you need to do but keep in mind so much of what we're hearing about this disease is not founded in fact. It's worst-case scenario speculation.Edited: 9:07 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"""So when an reporter on MSNBC tells you that 14-20% of us will die that's irresponsible.""What reporter said that and when? Would it be okay for reporters to call this a hoax?"
Here's a recap of today's news:https:/…JUST CANCEL.
"Oh heck, Practice, I don't remember the guy's name. But I heard it myself. NO, of course reporters shouldn't be calling it a hoax. Yet at the same time they shouldn't be fear-mongering based on pure speculation either. Times like these call for being level-headed and not only thinking about ratings."
"Napa, not very good to post something you can't back up. That would be fear mongering, no?While I can't claim to recall much about that 14-20%, I *think* it was about elderly people only...........and came originally from a medical source? Does that jog anyone's memory?SW the Maui Meanie."
That percentage has been bandied about as a guess of what percentage of those sick will have severe cases.Please don’t post things you aren’t certain about.
"That was my thought too, that it is a reference to patients who will develop serious and potentially life long complications OR death. I have referenced it on various posts for weeks now. The hyper focus on death as the only negative outcome is dangerous."
"Guess one or two of you are getting all your information on Coronavirus from some of the “Experts” here. I feel sorry for you if this is where you have to go for to get the latest updates. As my mother used to say looks like we’re going to hell in a hand basket.Edited: 9:50 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Ah, the joys of hysteria!"
"""Napa, not very good to post something you can't back up. That would be fear mongering, no?"" I think some of you missed my point which I thought was pretty clear but I guess not. This was that the media is practicing fear-mongering by by stating scenarios that THEY cannot back up. It's irresponsible reporting. Period. And yes, it's fear mongering by top media outlets but why am I surprised. And NO, I cannot state the exact name, date or time so shoot me. Look, I could say the many threads we have going on here about this virus and the verbage being casually tossed about in almost every post with some harsh and moralistic self-righteous accusations thrown at people. This forum by itself is practicing fear mongering in my opinion. Look, we're venturing into relatively unknown territory here. No one has all the answers, even the experts. Let's all lighten up a little and stop the attacks on one another.Edited: 12:53 am, March 16, 2020 "
"""I think some of you missed my point which I thought was pretty clear but I guess not. This was that the media is practicing fear-mongering by by stating scenarios that THEY cannot back up.""How is anyone to determine if a statement can or cannot be backed up without knowing the original source? YOUR assertion is the one not backed up."
"Maybe we should close this thread. Normally this board is full of aloha. We have regular contributors who have helped many with their expertise and experiences on Kauai. We aren’t the experts on this topic and folks can get facts, commentary and speculation from the news. This topic is full of fear, uncertainty, and trying to discern what one should or shouldn’t do. Sometimes a lot of opinions are more confusing than clarifying."
So now the opinion (which had lots of factual information) of a Harvard Doc is under suspicion? I actually think this is a good thread that is related to travel. I doubt anyone clicks on the links posters provide anyway. This lays it all out.I especially think it's helpful for those TLDR's to just see how the numbers work. It helps to see the math
Where's the ALOHA? Where is the aloha in doing what one wants no matter what the impact on others?

Kristine it is not even safee to go on the plane flight!
Kristine I don’t think the CDC site goes far enough. It doesn’t ask if should you fall sick will you put undo stress on the health system to where you are traveling. If that place is Kauai the answer is yes.
"Kristine, I'm a few years younger than you. We have flights scheduled to go to the mainland in mid May. Although just one week ago we (dh and I) decided we would wait until mid April to make the final decision. We are pretty much convinced today that traveling then isn't in the best interest of ourselves or anyone else. The situation isn't going to get better anytime soon."
"The Surgeon General said the US is now where Italy was 2 weeks ago. If that doesn't scare people, I don't know what would.As more tests get done (thanks to the private labs), many more cases will be uncovered. People need to STAY HOME."

"Yesterday, the Mayor of Kauai implemented an island-wide mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. He also said that airline travel to Kauai will be limited to essential needs only. ""Until further notice, visitors should not be traveling to our island for recreational purposes.""Given the uncertainty over Covid-19, I strongly suggest you consider canceling your vacation and postponing until further notice."
"Hawaii is closed to vacationers. After Friday March 20, only planes providing essential services are allowed. Cruise ships are only allowed to refuel and replenish. No one is allowed to disembark. Restaurants are serving takeout, only."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!The very few remaining restaurants here where I live just closed down - the only way you can get restaurant food is by take out or delivery if it is offered.All people must be back at their accommodations by 9pm as of today - and cannot leave until 5am (exceptions for workers who have a night shift).In some ways this reminds me of the days after 9/11 - I was working at the Sheraton front desk and once the visitors on island were able to leave, it was pretty much a visitor free island for a lengthy period of time.So we résidents will get by - I have no worries about that and the lack of visitors. But any incoming tourists will only be stretching our minimal resources and finding things closed down not to mention making it more difficult for us to “flatten the curve” of COVID-19. I am very glad that steps have been taken to stop all non essential travel here.  For instance we only have 6 ICU beds on island. We will all get more info from Mayor Derek this afternoon.Malama Pono,JanetEdited: 4:42 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"I wish people wouldn't post false info like that planes aren't flying.....it doesn't help.There are IDEAS being discussed about limiting air travel. Only the Feds can do that.
