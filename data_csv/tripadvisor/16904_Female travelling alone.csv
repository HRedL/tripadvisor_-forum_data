I’d like to visit Amsterdam for a couple of nights next week. Flights and accommodation appear available but I just want to gauge some opinion about a female travelling alone. Is it safe? Where is good to visit? I’m genuinely happy to spend time alone exploring the city but I’d just like to check that I’ll feel safe if that makes sense? Thanks
You'll be safe.
Perfectly safe. I have gone by myself and with my husband. No worries. The biggest threat is possibly getting hit by a bicycle until you learn to watch for them.)Edited: 1 year ago 
As long as you use usual common sense you should be fine.Woman traveling alone to Amsterdam is one of our more popular thread topics.Edited: 1 year ago 
Not all areas of Amsterdam are safe! I got lost and had some issues in the western part of the city which appeared to be mostly ethnic. Those people did not like me. They were quite angry for no apparent reason. Thankfully I was on a bicycle and got out of there in a hurry.
"Devonsha, I understand and can see that, no city is completely safe, but when there are people around you shouldn't worry too much. As probably sounds very familiar, use common sense. No city is completely shielded from bad characters, but as long as you're down town you should be fine. I don't know you, but some people appear to be magnets for trouble. I am sure you're not one of them. It ain't Warrington though."
"We stayed for three weeks in the Oud West area, where the population is ""mostly ethnic,"" and had no problems other than eating way too much baklava."
"There were lots of people around when I was threatened! These were not just simply a few bad people I was unfortunate to encounter. Later I told a Dutch woman what happened and I asked ""Why are they so angry?"" She replied in Dutch style, answering to what she thought I was inferring (I wasn't). ""They have a right to here."" I didn't say anything."
OFG’sS. The OP will be just fine in the center areas.
My thought exactly.
"And in West she will be safe too, and in East and South and North. Apply basic common sense and you'll be fine... @Devonsha: maybe you attract that sort of behaviour for some reason? Gotta love the racial slur in the reply too!Edited: 1 year ago "
Right enough! Many people can’t see their behavior towards others but judge others for sure and in the case of this poster that seems to be the case.For all others who don’t go around looking for others faults - Amsterdam is very safe!
"I really don't understand what 'devonsha' is trying to say. Why was she singled out (on her bicycle) by an angry mob of flaming torch and pitchfork carrying 'ethnics'? If so, what promoted this reaction?I can't make sense of it."
Consider the source.They have had an epidemic of strange and unusual.
"I bet they could provide proof if they were not afraid of “copyright” issues.One of my all time favorite excuses why someone will make a claim , while stating that everyone in that thread is wrong but them, but refuse to,post a link of proof."
She's just instigating. Pulling your chain. Ignore her and move on to something equally trivial :-)
"I didn't go look at ""others faults"". In fact I was hoping to find a bakery in that neighborhood and get one of those fried dough things that are covered in honey (not Balaclava). But now I would never go into that area at night if I were alone. In fact at night anywhere can be dangerous, not just from people. You may trip over something for example. Peronally, I like to be inside by the time tit gets dark, no matter where I am.Edited: 1 year ago "
Don't forget to turn on the lights.
Sometimes the lights are not enough or there at all. I will finish by saying: Go to Amsterdam and enjoy yourself!
"How sad it would be if everyone decided to be inside by the time it gets dark. Especially for those who visit the city in winter time. I was there in January once, and the hours of daylight were quite short. Had I not ventured out, I would have missed a lot."
"Trolls are often surrounded by pitchfork wielding, flaming torch carrying mobs are they not?"
She clearly is a Dutch local and a fraud.
That last part is true. I take insult on the first part...
She (he?) clearly is NOT a Dutch local and a troll.And trolls will keep trolling if we keep feeding them.
Not a local was never a local but is quite funny and entertaining as long as you are not someone taking their advice as serious.
