I have an Iceland trip planned the second week of April. Scrambling for answers right now and weather Iceland is part of the travel ban?
"I’m in the same boat more or less and have the same concern. I don’t think they can stop citizens from returning home, though quarantine may be required upon return. I’m not a State Dept official, however, so I reached out to them and the US embassy in Iceland to ask. I’m curious if anyone has definite insight."
Same here. Emailed the U.S. embassy and State Department. Need clarification soon!!!
"From a press release, by the US Department of Homeland Security, on the travel ban:<< Today President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation, which suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. ... This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation. >>https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homeland…"
"Last time I checked, Iceland is in Europe."
"Yep - I was hoping for an implied continental Europe there. At any rate, my trip to Iceland is during the travel ban, but my return is after the 30-day ban. So the risk is the ban being extended or Iceland putting in place its own quarantines."

">>Last time I checked, Iceland is in Europe.<<So is the UK, yet the ban doesn't apply to travelers to and from the UK."
"I read the announcement at the US DHS site and the ban doesn’t apply to US legal residents. It appears the same rules to the previous ban apply. What was most problematic for US travelers was a statement by the Acting DHS Secretary that he would compel travelers from Schengen to pass through quarantine station airports upon return. There’s only about a dozen or so of them in the US, so return flights might get altered if/when that advisory is issued by DHS."
"- So is the UK, yet the ban doesn't apply to travelers to and from the UK.Or Ireland (or Romania, Bulgaria or Croatia). As far as it's being reported in the UK, it seems it's non-US citizens travelling from Schengen countries. It's insane - besides the fact that it's already in the USA anyway, what's to stop a French person travelling via London or Dublin? As an aside, and obviously nothing to do with it, Trump has golf courses in the UK and Ireland."
"“So is the UK, yet the ban doesn't apply to travelers to and from the UK.”The ban applies to the Schengen countries. UK is not part of it."
Yes. I know that.But does the COVID-19 virus know that?Last time I checked they were battling the same issues in the UK as we are here.
"It is one step in the process to arrest the spread. Necessary but not sufficient. From what I understand, more intra-US measures are also required. Ideally you want a complete lockdown like what China did (and if numbers are to be believed, the Wuhan R0 is now below 1)."
ilas: I wouldn't be so sure that that is not related.
"Given that roughly 40% of Europe <> US flights are from/to either the UK or Ireland (over 30% via the UK, about 6% via Ireland), it's not so much a back door as an entirely missing back wall.Edited: 6:43 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Icelandair will fly to only New York, Chicago, Seattle, and Washington D.C during this travel ban. https:/…"
"#10 Yes, I agree it is insane and very poorly thought through and implemented.However, imho, the person responsible will likely continue bragging that the low number of US cases is a direct result of his implementing travel bans at the appropriate times, all the while ignoring that residents/citizens of his own country are just as likely to be the source of what is undeniably going to be an alarming, possibly catastrophic, countrywide disaster.The continuing inability for US residents/citizens to be tested is a travesty and just as great a threat to everyone, at home and abroad. So sad!Anyone considering whether or not to travel to another country at this time needs to weigh their main options: a financial loss of money that has already been spent or committed vs the potential loss of getting sick or placed in quarantine and not being able to work for 2-4 weeks, or more. Choose wisely.Edit: Not suggesting that staying home will guarantee staying healthy, but at least you’ll be in your own home!Edited: 9:37 am, March 12, 2020 "
"DeltaWing, take your ""Orange Man Bad"" patter elsewhere. One hopes that at least a travel forum stays clean of the other virus."
"Plus please consider the risk of infecting others, possibly more vulnerable than you, if you have little or no symptoms and bring home the virus from somewhere else."
"VoiceofGoa--We are in the Seattle area, so the hotbed for the virus in the US. The schools around here are closing for a while to hopefully slow the spread of this. Some schools have announced 2 week closures, but quite a few are going for 6 week closures. I think this is a good step to take.Our trip is not until later in August, so I am holding out hope."
"I work in healthcare. 70-80% of the population is going to get the virus and most people will recover. The goal now is to spread out the timing of the infection so large numbers of people are not infected all at once. The US health care system and infrastructure can't handle the projected infection rates if everyone gets sick all at once. Even slow rates of infection are going to stress out our system.That being said, the US is really late to the party in terms of preventing the spread of this. The latest travel restrictions weren't thought out and the overall response since January has been very poor.Edited: 9:46 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Mtngrl - Hoping for the best outcome for you and your area (and for the whole country/world). This is not the time for cheap political shots, nor is this the right forum for that activity."
"A travel forum can provide varying points of view and suggest options, but also present facts. An important fact to consider is that some countries are testing and identifying COVID-19 positive individuals at varying rates: https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-…I agree with Kim that we should also be considering the implications of risks taken to those individuals around us who are more vulnerable, the elderly and immunocompromised."
"""A travel forum can provide varying points of view and suggest options, but also present facts.""That kind of broad criteria would include every conceivable topic in the observable universe. It is one thing to discuss travel policy and its effects, quite another to air your political preferences/prejudices."
"#24 With all due respect, my posts have not been based on political preferences/prejudices regardless of what you’re implying. They have been meant to get people thinking for themselves.I’m a Canadian and I only vote in Canadian elections; I wouldn’t want anyone to tell me how to vote in my own country, and I extend the same courtesy to others."
@voice of goa. Sometimes the truth hurts.
"Voice of GoaThank you for taking upon yourself the role of political watch-dog. Your post condoning the travel ban might be considered political, since generally the travel-ban idea is being discussed as an option by politicians but is dismissed by the medical community.I’m going to say it out loud: The ban is a joke:Take the 26 European countries with the best public health-care and (probably) the best screening and put them on a ban-list. Why these 26? What do they have in common? The Schengen Open Border policy.Do not place 16 other European countries on the banned list.That later list includes countries with excellent public health-care like Ireland and UK where the spread of Corona follows the same patterns as in most of the countries on the banned list. But it also includes countries with limited health services like Albania, Belarus, Turkey and Armenia. Label the virus as an “European” virus and try to assure the public that (a) since the virus is European and (b) all Europeans are banned from travel to the USA their country is safe? (“All” being 450 million out of a total of aprox 750 million Europeans)."
"Gestur,You must be confusing me with someone else. I'm the one arguing against bringing politics into this travel forum, the opposite of what political watchdogs are about. I have no intention of ever being any watchdog, political or otherwise. I say my piece, just like you and others do yours. Pace your claim, there are differing views regarding the travel ban. The head of Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, advising the President and charged with addressing the spread of the Wuhan virus in the US, had this to say - https:/…1238094994424111104"
"On top of that, the fact that the UK and Ireland aren't in Schengen doesn't mean much, in practical terms. There's still free travel from the other 26 and there are no health checks at the border. I came back from the Netherlands early on Monday - all that happened was the usual passport check, for me and every other British, Dutch, French, Belgian or German person on the flight. Infection rates here aren't much different to other countries.It's a political gesture, in my opinion. Brexit? Dislike of the EU? Trump resorts? Who knows, but if it were serious, you'd include not just the UK, Ireland and other non-Schengen EU countries, but Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, etc, etc. Even more so perhaps, because as Gestur says above, many have pretty basic healthcare systems. Russia claims it only has 28 cases. Really? 28? Anyone want a bridge?"
"<< ... the Wuhan virus ... >> is the epitome of political preferences/prejudice at this point in time of the pandemic, and a label we should all refrain from using.At minimum it should be called the coronavirus, although its official name per the WHO is COVID-19."
"Guys, please leave politics out of this. There are other appropriate forums for this type of discussion."
"#30 DeltaWing - I must have misplaced by card to the Woke club. More apropos, you should try reading. Heard of Old Lyme, Connecticut? Ebola river? Zika, Uganda? No? Try this -https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30440/12-diseases-and-lucky-places-they’re-named"
"We should be using accurate names used by WHO (Ebola, Zika, COVID-19, etc) in our discussions.Edited: 12:12 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"VoiceofGoa - You are being willfully obtuse. Ebola Virus is the correct term; Wuhan Virus is not. Yes, it matters."
"Yep. Ebola was named after the river because they did not want to stigmatize the settlement of Yambuku as people were initially calling it the Yambuku fever.Edited: 2:39 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Some additional information on the Trump travel ban:https:/…
@Voice of GoaGet you facts straight. Ebola was NOT named after a river!
"From the CDC ""Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.""Also the same reason the West Nile VIrus is named after the area if was first identified in Uganda."
"Nice, Irongrl, but please don't expect any Mea Culpa or a word of thanks from anyone here for helping dispel the mists of their...what's the word...ignorance. Instead, you can expect more of the surly retorts.Have at it, fellas. I'm out of here."
"Ciao. Only certain people call it after the region where it started, and they have an agenda"
