HiDoes anyone know when coral island will reopen as government guidelines say amusements can open on the 4th?
Have a look at their website
Thanks I have. Also looked at their Facebook page and doesn’t say. Thought someone local might have some more info either way.
Hi Yorkies_15Some info here.https://www.coralisland.co.uk/coronavirusMargaurite
When are you going?I can have a look on the 5th.
"Just come off the phone with my sister and she has been informed that ""Coral Island "" hoping to open Monday. (They would like to open Saturday) but can't say. Depends on when they have the inspection done, so not a cert! MargauriteEdited: 4:42 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Btw, thats excluding the casino..that will be closed.Margaurite"
No problem with no casino open it would just be great to be in there as always part of our Blackpool visit.
"Don't know whether you know "" Blackpool Illuminations"" been extended by 2 months this year, Sept 4th/3rd Jan 2021. Bear in mind too that dates/times of all info is subject to change... Hope you're in luck with Coral Island. Have a great time...https:/…Margaurite"
Yes Thankyou already had discussions about a visit later in the year to see the lights again when hopefully things have improved and we can have more of the usual experience
