"Hi we are going to stay in STJ the first two night and the last 4 nights in STT this july 4th weekend. Should we get a rental car or taxi would be fine going around? We will arrive at 3:30pm on Thurs July 1st, will we have enough time to catch the car barge to STJ?What car barge company would you recommend and do they take reservation in advance? Thanks"
"Having your own wheels and the ability to go where you want when you want is priceless. These aren't walking islands, public transportation is limited and unreliable and taxis charge per person with the fares adding up very fast.Here is the barge schedule and you can reserve with Love City:https:/…"
"I recommend renting a jeep from Amalie on St. Thomas. You have time to take the car barge; they have been running reliably. We road the barge back and forth yesterday and just drove onto the waiting barge. We rode the Grand Vic to St. Thomas and the Big Red Barge named Todd G on the way back to St. John. We would have to wait a half hour longer to ride Grand Vic again, but they started loading as we left St. Thomas. Reservations give you peace of mind for your first time.Cheers, RickG"
You're only on STJ for 2 nights and unless you're staying somewhere up a steep unpaved road you may not need the additional expense of a 4WD vehicle (which you DON'T need on St Thomas).
Thank you all for the useful info! How’s the Covid-19 restriction there now? Are most places open yet? Thanks
"Some but not all charters are operating. Many restaurants are open with social distancing, disposable plates and flatware. Bars are open but the Governor is debating closing them - very up in the air now that we have community transfer. Masks required in all public places. When you arrive you'll have your temperature checked and be advised of all restrictions."
"I'm confused about the pricing of the barge. On the site, from the link above, it states $4 for a car and then below that states $35 or $50. What is the $4 for?Also, are all barges loading and unloading from the same place and just have staggered times?Edited: 10:17 am, June 27, 2020 "
"You missed the part at the beginning of the paragraph where it says that the additional few dollars is for a government port fee. The $35 and $50 reflect one way or round trip fare and yes, if you look at the schedule you'll see that the times are staggered."
"If you buy a round trip ticket you have to use it on the same barge company, keep that in mind. Personally we don’t do that because you never know how plans can change. Also, just for future reference, if you are coming to the islands, especially during a holiday time you would want to have your vehicle booked WAY before now or risk having a hard time finding one. Considering the current situation I don’t think you’ll have a problem!"
"I have a question about the barge, does the barge just ferry the car and we would take another ferry to get across the island then pick up our car form the barge or are there passenger seats on the barge too? There are multiple barge companies, is there one you would recommend over the others? ThanksEdited: 6:55 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"You back the car onto the barge and stay with it (you don't have to stay in the vehicle), and drive it off once you get into Cruz Bay All passengers and all car contents are included in the fare. There are three barge operators and just pick which ever best suits your travel plans. You can reserve space on Love City but not on the others and the operators don't accept each other's tickets.https:/…"
Thank you for all your helpful answers STTResident!
