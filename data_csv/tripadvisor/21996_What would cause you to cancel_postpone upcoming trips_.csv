"This is more in reference to Coronavirus. I’ve told my wife that if it got to the point where numerous restaurants, pools, and so on were closed the I’d postpone."
Yay. Another Coronavirus thread.
Yes. If everything was closed I'd postpone my trip.
"I travel on a crowded London Underground train twice a day, 5 days a week, and mingle with crowds of people in Central London shops, bars, restaurants etc.As things stand, I'm probably more likely to get the virus here than if I was in Vegas.So I would only cancel/postpone a Vegas trip if either the UK or US governments/health authorities were officially advising not to travel there.Not that I've got any trips to Vegas in the pipeline right now!"
"i'm treating the Corona Virus like the flu. I'm a healthy person so If I contract either, it'll suck and i'll recover. I live in CT and hike in the woods and have the risk of lyme disease. I would say i'm more concerned about that but it doesn't stop me from hiking."
"As someone else already mentioned in another thread, when Randall Flagg comes to town.Edited: 9:56 am, March 05, 2020 "
"It was “ Randall Flagg is elected as Mayor” , I think."
Caroline but I'm sure you are taking all the recommended preventive measures though.
I would be concerned if Pauly Shore made another movie. I'm pretty sure that would be a bad sign of things to come.
"I’m going to Las Vegas next week & to Puerto Vallarta in June. I do not plan on cancelling either trip. I refuse to stay home on my couch worried about catching a virus. If in June there are restrictions and/or quarantines, etc in place for arriving in the USA or Mexico, then I will consider cancelling."
I would just be cautious in the short term and see what happens in the next few months. A Vegas trip for the umpteenth time isn't anything special anyway.
"Irish, it was Randall Flagg elected Mayor in the thread, but Randall Flagg aka The Walking Dude, won't be elected he will just take over."
"We've canceled a number of LV visits through the years. It has always been about our personal health. Not about what might happen, but about what did happen. However we did cancel a long trip to DC right after 9/11. Not because we were afraid, but because many of the things we wanted to see were no longer available to us."
"""Yay. Another Coronavirus thread.""Pretty sure IrishFan nailed it."
I'll be calling Coronavirus/Covid-19 its proper name from now on in here: Captain Trips
Come on. This is the thread you choose to start? How many do we need?
Anyone noticed that 'coronavirus' is an anagram of 'carnivorous'?Just thought I'd throw that useless piece of info out there: )
"We have our trip planned in April... my wife and i discuss this issue daily, my thoughts are, it appears that the U.S. governments are doing all possible to handle the situation for minimum effects to the puplic, we also have infected people in canada.... i think if you are in the lower risk catagory and do take the suggested precautions, ie. Washing your hands often, using sanitizers... Most of all keep upto date with whats going on, you should be able to make a sound decision, i hope it all works out for everyone to be able to enjoy vegas in a normal manner."
@espn....or...A6?
"Great post Shacky, but by April who knows were we'll be? I've cancelled a May trip not from fear of the effects of the disease, but I don't want to get quarantined someplace other than home.Edited: 11:03 am, March 05, 2020 "
"^^I'm eagerly awaiting the 'If I get quarantined in a Las Vegas hotel room, do I have to pay resort fees' threadEdited: 11:30 am, March 05, 2020 "
Probably if half the world has it.
"Leaving tomorrow for LV, 6 days, convention, trade show. Already paid $1000s in show cost and freight. I assumed there will be lower attendance. I shall have no travel for 3 months, until covid19 goes away in summer."
"We are having our umpteenth trip to Las. Vegas in early MayAll I’m worried about is if the flights get cancelled We are taking all precautions I.e. not going on public transport, washing hands lots more than usual.But I so look forward to our Vegas holiday.Fingers crossed"
Pauly Shore is deadacorn u vs air
"If the pools, restaurants, casino was closed, I'd cancel. That is the whole point of the trip.Frankly, I've been toying with calling Wynn Palace in Macau and offering them a few grand per night to stay in one of their whale only Garden Villas. Business is dead, why not make a little $$$. I'm not worried about getting Coronavirus."
"I cancelled my late Sept trip after 9/11 because I was worried about the reliability of the transportation system, but rebooked for December. So large disruptions to the transportation system would be my cause to postpone and currently I down really see that as a risk.Going to Biloxi on a junket in a couple weeks, where in Dec 2018 my seat mate gave me the worst cold I have ever had, it knocked me down for 2 weeks.As a side note I also drive to Caesars Windsor often and will be on the look out for border issues, just taking every ones temp at the crossing would create huge delays."
"What would cause you to cancel/postpone upcoming trips?Knowing that TrueKCRoyalsfan and his sidekick jamborino, were thereEdited: 1:51 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I've got bad news for you qdog. I'm moving permanently to Vegas next month.Don't take it too hard. There's always Atlantic City, which has the added benefit of being much closer to home for you (every cloud, and all that..).: )"
"Closed casinos or flight canceled without being able to rebook are currently the only things I think that would stop me. Or if it really became like Captain Trips but do not see that happening. (aside from the book - whoelse really liked the mini series? My husband thinks I'm crazy but he is a SK book purist.) Husband's company just sent an email yesterday stating no travel between now and end of April and we're like ""they obviously mean business travel, since it didn't specify"". 38 days and counting."
"I've only read The Stand and the Dark Tower series. I have a hard time with all of the tv/film adaptations I've seen of them.I'm really looking forward to the new miniseries they're making for The Stand.Edited: 2:33 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"@katijuice, I'm also an SK book purist, simply because his weaving of multiple characters and plot arcs doesn't often translate well to a screen. Budget constraints, probably.I've been a fan since his Bachman days (""The Long Walk"" positively terrified me as a teen). Have you read ""Night Surf""? It's a short story that predates ""The Stand"" and likely is the basis for the later work...it was based on a naturally mutating virus (A6) from Asia rather than a lab strain gone rogue. Scarier to me, especially in recent years. I'm due in LV for my birthday in late May. But my doctor will have the final say so...Edited: 2:44 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I have read about 75% of Kings books, but no I do not believe I have read ""Night Surf"". The only short stories I can think of right now are from the Different Seasons book that has the ""Long Walk"" (Stand by me) and ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Or that one a few years ago that he sold as a single (Joy Ride? Whatever the carnival one was called) . I do know that the book is almost always better as it can go more in depth, and maybe it's because I saw the mini series for The Stand before reading the book (I was like 15 when it aired) where as all my husband can see are the missing pieces and inconstancies. Shawshank is my favorite movie and he loves to remind me that prisons would not have been segregated in that time frame so Morgan Freeman should not have been cast as Red."
"If my cardiologist said I had to have a quadruple heart bypass by tomorrow or I will die, I would postpone my Vegas trip."
"@PB, Prayers to you, see you on the other side of your surgery!"
"Thanks In_Seeno, but I'm not going to have one. Already had one a few years ago, but that's what it would take to get me to postpone a trip."
"Something major happening in my family or with my house. Right now we are booked in the MGM Grand for August 28th to September 3rd. I have just found out that my daughter in law is pregnant with my first grandchild that is due mid October. With that said, I don't know if we will be able to go because they live in Florida and I'm in Brooklyn, NY and will be going back and forth for things like the baby shower and then for the birth and also the holidays. Right now I'm holding off canceling but this would be something that I would cancel for. I can't wait to hold this baby and love it."
"President Donald Trump suggested during an interview on Fox News Wednesday that many people with mild coronavirus symptoms could still go to work and get better. This goes against advice from medical professionals around the world who say that infected individuals should remain in isolation.“A lot of people will have this and it’s very mild. They’ll get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor, they don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “So you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and or virus. So you just can’t do that. So, if you know, we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work. Some of them go to work, but they get better.”...sez the unstable genius !"

"Shadow, here's some math for you: 70 cases 11 deaths in Washington....15.7%"
DTC - How many of those deaths in Washington are elderly and/or have pre existing health conditions?I'm not going to worry too much other than taking normal hygiene precautions.
"I could be wrong, jchav. But I think they were your age and about the same height and weight."
"Yeah, I already knew the answer. I just wanted to hear you say it since you were trying to sound the alarm with your misleading stats."
"Hey that isn't misleading.. 11 out of 70 is 15.7%.It's like fipping a coin where the first 6-7 are all heads.Edited: 6:29 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"And of those 11, how many died at one nursing home ? Did you conveniently leave out that fact to stir the pot ?Edited: 6:50 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"Around the world, the median age of the current outbreak is 49-56. The youngest with the virus is a baby 30 hrs old."
"Shadow, here's some math for you: 70 cases 11 deaths in Washington....15.7%It has a mortality rate under 3%, still high but not 15%. Its high in Washington because it hit a nursing home. If you introduce any respiratory virus into a community of immune compromised individuals the mortality rate goes up. You could have flipped that and said its 0% for people under 18. Point is that while the virus is certainly more than the common flu, it doesnt have a high mortality rate for healthy people with little exposure. Most recover fairly well, and Trump albeit ineloquent, is likely correct. Many people have had the virus, didnt know it and recovered. In healthy people it mimics symptoms of any common respiratory flu. People get it, get over it and move on. Again the concerns for me are the quarantine period and I would not want to unknowingly pass the virus on to immune compromised people on the plane, at my place of work or my family. Like the flu, it can be passed on during an asymptomatic incubation period."

You believe that in Chicago, or anywhere for that matter, 85%+ gun shootings end in death? Not even close:https:/…It's closer to a third. However it IS closer to your number for suicides.

The U.S. gun suicide rate is 10 times that of other high-income countries.Access to a gun triples the risk of death by suicide. Gun suicides are concentrated in states with high rates of gun ownership.""Most people who attempt suicide do not die—unless they use a gun. Across all suicide attempts not involving a firearm, 4 percent will result in death. But for gun suicides, those statistics are flipped: Approximately 90 percent of gun suicide attempts end in death.""Edited: 11:55 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I would neither cancel nor postpone any of my domestic travel trips. I quite honestly don't see any particular reason of doing so.Plentiful people in other public places (grocery/drugstores, shopping malls, concert halls/venues, restaurants, bus/subway systems, taxis, places of worship, & so on) elsewhere. Not only at the airport, on a flight, or inside a hotel/casino resort. Much everything's been touched &/or handled by many others; are you going to alcohol wipe down every individual thing prior to touching it? Most likely not."

">>People need to realize the simple fact, you get a flu shot, it prevents the current season flu<<this is wildly inaccurate. they guess the strains that might be prevalent, and put those in the vaccine every year, but it's extremely hit and miss. overall, it has reduced the risk of getting flu by 19-60% over the last 10 years. last year, it was an estimated 45%.https://bit.ly/3cBT5aXthe overwhelming majority of people who die from flu are very young, very old, or immunocompromised. the same happens to be true of Captain Trips so far.we have exactly zero idea how virulent Captain Trips is because we don't know how widespread infections are. a lot of people may have contracted it, and think they just had a cold. read from a variety of sources.please don'talk about things you don't understand.Edited: 10:02 pm, March 05, 2020 "
I'm in Chicago and I don't have coronavirus and i'm not shot! Not all hope is lost!
lucky man!
"ESPN..then don’t get the current flu shot..then u get ZERO protection ...I have never had the flu in 60 years, so either I am lucky or flu shot works... don’t put your seatbelt on, as many people in car wrecks die wearing one...called taking precautions ...but to each his own..."
"i get it every year, but i don't think it's that crazy of me to point out that getting it most certainly does not prevent the current season flu. leave your anecdotes out of it. i just posted a link to data compiled by experts.something the cdc has made very clear about coronavirus is that a lot of people may have contracted it and thought it was just a mild cold, so it didn't get reported. that could be a big reason for the mortality rate being so high right now. we won't know for sure until a lot more data is collected. we do know the overwhelming majority of deaths are in people who are elderly/infirm, or who are immunocompromised.Edited: 1:21 pm, March 06, 2020 "

If you think a trip to Las Vegas is too risky you could always take a cruise.
"I'm booked to go in late April and I'd say I'm only a 50/50 chance (at best) of going at this stage. Not even considering cancelling til we get much closer to the date & I can see how USA is coping with it. The 14+ hour flight is worrying me, as is the possibility I could get sick over there and it appears to me the USA health system is not at all prepared for this. I'm in my 50s, so there is a reasonable chance I would need hospitalisation if I got it. If it's as bad as it is now or worse, I'll be cancelling and will re-book when it's safe to do so."
Casino looks busy. Nobody wearing mask.
This virus is a Royal Flush against a pair of deuces.
"Walked passed restaurants, look full. Corridor is full of gamblers."

"Hi. Don't know where you are staying but a lot of shows have cancelled for a month, all MGM buffets, sports events, and pools are also closed until april sometime, check your resort before you come just to be on the side of caution.
