"Hi, we are planning trekking in Sapa on about October 26. Have you guys seen lots of mosquitoes there in few last days? We are concerned on safety as a dengue epidemic rise in Vietnam in October. Thanks in advance for any tips."
"Just cover up and use repellent. The local product Remos is safe, it contains only 15% DEET, but is very effective."
"Hi, have you been there recently maybe?"
"2 weeks ago. Ì was on a three week photo trip of the north. Never got bitten, not even once. And we were constantly outside in the wild and rough.Edited: 2 years ago "
