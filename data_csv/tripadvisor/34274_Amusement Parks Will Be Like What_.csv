"A few guesses:Opening June at the earliest 50% occupancy limitAll employees in masks and perhaps other protective equipment.All guests must wear masks, I'm not sure what happens when eating, guests would have to be very spread apart.Hand grips on rides will have to be sprayed down after every ride.Rides that get people wet will be closed."
Why would rides that get people wet have to be closed?
"That was a bit of a stretch. I made a leap. My daughter works as a carny at a park. One of the games the children reach in with nets and catch the ,floating on a small pool in a circle, plastic fish. I wondered how much a virus would be happy getting moved around like that and could it transfer.So then I was thinking on a bigger scale with splash rides. But I'm not in anyway totally confident in my conclusion. However I do think the parks will keep things tight in over abundance of caution."
I don’t see any of those happening.
"(I wanted to fix my grammar, from previous post, but was too late)So you think when they open everything will be hunky dory? I believe by the end of this month you'll find almost all businesses in general will be requiring masks for entry.Edited: 7:13 pm, April 04, 2020 "
I think there has to be a regime of mass testing with attestation of negative results or immunity for staff and visitors as a bare minimum condition for opening a mass audience venue.Disney will be the test case imho.
“So you think when they open everything will be hunky dory? I believe by the end of this month you'll find almost all businesses in general will be requiring masks for entry.“I think they’ll stayed closed until parks can be open under normal conditions.
"If you are really interested to know what's happening and what is in the works, go to the Theme Park Obsession you tube channel and watch the latest live stream that was streamed yesterday and then continue to watch. Dylan, the channel's creator, is doing weekly live streams from home while the parks are closed. If you would like you may ask your question in the live chat, but you ought to subscribe to the channel to get notification of when the live stream will occur. Seems to be every Friday. Alternatively, you could follow him on Instagram and find out the times that way. Dylan has worked for Universal Studios Hollywood in the past. His channel has focused on news and updates from all of the Southern California Parks. Knott's Berry Farm announced today that anyone with any of the three types of Season Passes will have all benefits and add ons extended through December 31, 2021 in addition to the rest of this year after the park re-opens. (Also those on the easy payment plan will see their payments suspended until Knott's repoens.) So all current Season Pasholders are basically getting an extra year. I am hearing that Disneyland Resort has announced they will implement a virtual queue system for ""big rides"" in order to move people through queues quicker and that will help set the numbers going through a queue better than FP. It's my hope, but not speculation, that Disneyland will not have any fireworks shows at all until the end of the year. I feel the same way about the parades. In my opinion, it would be a good idea to cut down the amount of people allowed into the viewing sections of Fantasmic and World of Color by issuing less Fast Pass and usher guests in so that they are not too close. However, it might be best to postpone those until the end of the year. I just think it would be good in general to have a hiatus on any entertainment that draws large numbers of crowds. That's not to say it wouldn't be wonderful to see them, but it could be safer and also save the company money. On the other hand it will put some entertainers out of work. I've become personally concerned in the last few years with Disneyland instructing their cast members to tell guests slightly before fireworks and parades to move forward, squeeze in, and allow more guests in. It has made watching fireworks and parades extremely uncomfortable for me even to the point of a potential anxiety attack. Thankfully, that has GOT to be a thing of the past! I don't think anything you are speculating will be put in place and I think theme park CEOs will decide to wait to re-open when it is much safer rather than make such decisions. Having said that, I would speculate that attendance will be down at all theme parks after they first re-open and for awhile because guests will still be cautious and, unfortunately, there are more people out of work. So going to a theme park will not be top priority.I'm really curious how security check will be changed, especially at Disneyland Resort. I once had a security check where the guy put his hands over everything in my purse including tissues!Edited: 10:19 pm, April 04, 2020 "
"FYI about water rides. Disney used bromine in the water, which kills bacteria and some viruses. (It has a mild scent and is reason water in the Pirates of the Caribbean has a distinctive smell. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that it's a standard in theme parks for water rides. The carnival type game you described may also use bromine in the water, unless it's not inside an established theme park and part of simply a carnival."

"Look at what China is doing. Disney Shanghai and Hong Kong are still not open. But many other businesses, including restaurants and shopping malls, are beginning to open. A friend told me 80% of Shanghai restaurants are open now.What they are doing is checking customers' temperature religiously. At every restaurants, supermarkets, stores, subway entrances, you see staff armed with one of those electronic body temperature scanners. Everyone must have their temperature checked at entrance. Everyone wears face masks.These are a couple of things we are not doing in the US. There is zero temperature check anywhere. People are just very slowly started to wear face masks."
"CV survives longer via water molecules, so there's that.I agree that nothing will open until late May.If I were giving advice to Disney, I wouldn't open while there was still an objective need for N95 face masks on employees. Maybe space-age looking face masks, specially designed for Disney.In an ideal world, people could take the antibody test that's going to be deployed in CA very soon and have a card that made them safe to enter.Disney should open with less than 50% of normal capacity and then encourage people to social distance."
"Antibody test? Interesting, but...... https:/…While entry point of SARS CoV2 is through mucous membranes in eyes, mouth, and nose....hence masks and face shields...I don’t think water is per se a good medium for the virus to survive very long.If Walmart and Target can sell apparel, appliances, and electronics just because they are also grocers and sellers of cleaning supplies, it will be interesting to see if there are conditions under which other retailers that are not in the food business might not be opened.....safety and certificates of health of course.But first and foremost, need the massive testing, including retesting if appropriate. And until then, stay at home and hygiene."
There is only temperature screening going into some medical facilities. I have been getting scanned daily for the past 3 weeks going to work. Everyone coming in our outpatient building employees and patients are getting scanned.Many many people are working on the antibody tests but the limitations are as stated in that article. There was a huge drive through study by Stanford in Santa Clara County yesterday and today. I have friends who got kits from Asia and some kits may be available soon in California. But we need testing for acute infection first before antibodies (presumably for immunity but may not be that accurate).
I don't think Disneyland or Disneyworld will be open until late summer or fall. They have let go of all their college student workers (a large percentage of their workers in Orlando) and sent them back home.They won't open until it is safe. The virtual queues are a good idea.
"The DCP cast members in WDW stay together in housing (apartment complexes) that is arranged by the Disney Company, with a percentage of their pay going towards rent. Makes sense to send them home and term them out. There is no such living arrangement for DCP CMs at DLR. They must provide their own housing and they keep their full paycheck. Often they live with family while working in the Disney College Program and attending college courses as well. So when DLR closed their home lives did not change. Any DCP CMs who decided to get apartments together could make their own decisions to continue living that way or decide to move in with family and give up their apartment (which they likely could not afford any longer once they found out all CMs will lose pay) and they could move in with family. Cutting the DCP is just a wise financial decision and doesn't indicate anything except an easy way to cut costs. It was a very responsible decision for WDW and I'm sure the families of those CMs are happy to have them return from Florida."
">>What they are doing is checking customers' temperature religiously.<<Except that doesn't catch the up-to-50% of carriers that are symptom-free.And I would think that any test result that one is simply virus-free is useless within 24 hours after being done. One could catch the virus on the way home from the test, in theory. The only useful test for 'safe socialization' would be one that indicates you're both 'immune' yourself and not a carrier. (I don't know enough to know if any of the proposed/actual tests show both. The only results you ever hear discussed are ""positive"" or ""negative"".)"
There are also people who are recovered. And there is discussion that they might be immune....as well as some that they might get reinfected....lots of stuff we dont know about this darn virus....but the blood from those recovered might be a basis for a serological vaccine......we'll see.Right now the course of action remains as directed.
>>What they are doing is checking customers' temperature religiously.<<Except that doesn't catch the up-to-50% of carriers that are symptom-free.Which is better than not checking at all.
"Since Disney owns the “Star Wars” franchise, maybe dress all cast members as Chewbacca, Darth Vader/Kylo Ren, or Storm Troopers, with filtration built in?As for reopening, I would think perhaps Sept - but depends on how things go.Just a thought, and stay safe folk,Hunt"
"As the water rides, if masks are required, not sure that many would want to spend a day with a wet mask?Hunt"
CoronaVirus needs water to survive in between attacking people.Humid areas carry a heavier viral load.Dry is better. This has been known (with viruses) for a long time.
Don’t they chlorinate the water?I wouldn’t be stepping foot into a place like Disney until this was over and well after fall to be sure there was no secondary outbreak. But then I don’t find that to be a hardship.
"Bromine is used, not chlorine. Basically the same, just with a more pleasant scent and not harmful to skin or clothing. It's standard in theme parks. I'm surprised you don't know that."
"Why would you be surprised? I haven't been at a 'theme park' for 45 years. My point was, isn't the water treated for germs? God know how many kids are peeing in it. My point continues to be, however, that given the state/rate of this infections (plague, whatever), why would anyone want to go where large numbers of people congregate? And not only that, large numbers of people from all over the country and the world? Without some ""green pass"" to only allow entrance to those already with antibodies (not to mention all the employees), reopening these germ cesspools is an invitation to another outbreak."
"""My point continues to be, however, that given the state/rate of this infections (plague, whatever), why would anyone want to go where large numbers of people congregate? And not only that, large numbers of people from all over the country and the world?""Don't know the answer to the ""why"" question. But even today, with SIP orders, people still congregate. Because, hey, we are a free country, no?"
"Civil society cedes authority to the government for the social good. That's part of what the ""social contract"" means. Debating this is meaningless. And hopefully people are NOT congregating."
"I said this before. Especially for those of us who lived in the Bay Area during the AIDS pandemic would remember too well, people continued to practice unsafe sex during those times. You can hope people are not congregating, but the fact is, people still do. They go to private parties, they go to churches, they go to the beach with friends.There is even a discussion on our Nextdoor group about whether and how many lives we should sacrifice for economic stability.Edited: 10:27 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"As I commented, I think Disney will be the test case. It has the most to gain by reopening, but that also means it has the most to lose if that cannot be done safely and with the confidence of its visitor base. So, it probably already is studying the conditions under which it can safely open and what changes it must make to its previous processes on safety and visitor movement. Plus, despite its losses it probably has sufficient assets to thoroughly research how to do this right."
