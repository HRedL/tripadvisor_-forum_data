"I've heard from people who have been to New York before that there's a special kind of exchange that happens when you eat at a restaurant in America (he was talking from experience in New York, but I presume it's similar across the states).It was something like:* waiter brings your bill* you write on the bill how much you're going to tip (I think)* you give the bill + your credit card back to the waiter* the waiter swipes your card and returns a receipt for you to signThis seems a little strange because they've taken your card and swiped it without you seeing how much they're actually taking. Is this normal, am I mistaken? Does anyone know how the process works and if there's anything special a tourist from UK needs to know (inc. how the tip factors in to what you write on the bill).Thanks"
"Not quite You get a bill, you give them your card, they take the bill and card and swipe the card, they bring you a receipt and you write the tip and sign. You have a customer copy too for your records.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Not exactly.The server will bring a bill which you can review for accuracy.You'll then give the CC to the server who will take it to be swiped (hand held credit processing machines that can be brought to the table are not common here)The server will return your card and two copies of the receipt (one for you, one for them) which will have a line for the tip and a line for the total with the tip.On the receipts you indicate the amount of the tip and then total the bill. (The final total will be processed afterwards when the restaurant reconciles it's transactions) Leave the restaurant their copy and take your own and the card and go on your way.Edited: 3 years ago "
You also won't be given an option on whether you want to be charged in USD or your home currency - the charge will be in USD.
"Gotcha! Thank you, this makes sense :-)"
"Why not, Vichy? Lots of retail point of sale machines give the option to pay in your own currency (Don't do it, by the way, it's a really bad exchange rate. Google ""dynamic currency conversion""). Is there something unique about restaurant POS machines that precludes this from being offered by any restaurant?"
"Quof - I have no idea why. I know it's definitely an option as I'm given the option when I travel outside of the US, but it's never been presented as an option here when I'm out with friends who are visiting and charging on their cards. Not sure if the restaurants set their machines to default to USD or the servers do it when swiping, or something else altogether."
"Also, some restaurants give you a list of what to tip on the bill according to the percentage of the bill. The usual is somewhere between 15-20%."
The bill the server will bring you has a subtotal that includes itemized sales tax (sales taxes are not included in prices here and vary by jurisdiction - 8.875% in NYC - some items are exempt …nyc.gov/site/…business-nys-sales-tax.page )
"Not really on point but, just like to throw this out for those worried about someone handling their credit card ... OpenTable, the restaurant reservation app, lets you pay via the app. So your CC never leaves your wallet. But only implemented at certain restaurants."
You can also pay the bill and leave the tip in cash on the table if you prefer.You don't have to put it onto your credit card bill.It is up to you.
Carefully. Still lots of skimmers out there.
That's good to know also. Thanks
do new yorkers/americans in general find that their cards are skimmed often?As a tourist we found the system of taking away our cards very strange and all three times we've been to new york now my mums card has been hacked and her bank has had to cancel her card.In ireland we always get brought the machine and would never give our card to be taken away.
I do not believe they will bring a machine to you in a US restaurant. Have never seen it done that way. In some places like some diners you usually go up to the counter and pay there. In many restaurants its as described above. I never had a problem in NYC. I will say I went to a TGIFs in Philadelphia and the waiter took my card and was gone for like five minutes. Like a month later someone ran over 2k via that very same card at a pool supply store outside of Philadelphia. Since that was the only time the card was EVER out of my sight I believe he ripped it off. I would have caught the charge when it was pending if I was not out of the country. My bank was kinda stupid because I told them I was out of the country on these dates and they still did not think it was odd that I was in PA making a charge at a pool supply company while paying hotel bills in Japan the day before and after this charge. The bigger risk I think is from gas stations. You hear about people installing skimmers etc at the pumps. If you see something that looks weird or attached on don't use your card until you verify its legit.
"Many restaurants have the card swipe tech built in to their POS systems which is why they take your card, run it and bring back your final bill for payment. If not integral to the POS terminal. It's typically a machine that's hard wires into the phone line or over an Ethernet connection. They do have cellular based card swipe devices but they are pricey (for the merchant) and have signal issues (they're typically on the 2g data band which is being retired). In most other places around the world, I've often if not usually had the machine brought over to the table. Can't think of a single time that's happened in the US.Edited: 3 years ago "
"if you're worried/concerned about paying with a credit card that it's going to be scammed and it's out of your sight. Here's a crazy idea- get some cash from your bank, throw the cash Down with tip included and walk out . Works for me. I suppose they'll be a discussion about that you One should not carry large amounts of cash around but I think you can carry $200. It goes pretty darn fast in New York City."
I rarely carry cash. Pretty much never in NY. Most places have come around to accepting credit cards. For awhile in Brooklyn a lot of local joints were holding out and demanding cash but even they have finally given in for the most part. Someone in line at the grocery store a few days ago tried to pay with cash and they had to go get change for like a $20 and everyone in line got delayed as a result. It was like that credit card commercial If I was a tourist though I'd carry like $50 in emergency funds just in case.
"In almost 25 years of having credit cards (and I have many, I don't carry much cash at all), I have had a problem with a charge maybe 3 times. Three problems out of hundreds of thousands of transactions isn't bad to me. Two of the three times the credit card company contacted me about the charge and they issued me a new one. The third time I think that people actually had my card because I think it was left in my Jeep that was totaled. They have always been great about removing the charges. Therefore, I don't think twice about servers taking my credit card to swipe it."

"While I agree you should not carry large amounts of cash, I think it's always wise to carry *some* cashDo not to get too complacent about the reliability of technology. Yesterday the system at my grocery store went out and they were not able to process any cards. Most people had to abandon their carts - only a very few of us were able to complete our purchases because we had cash. One person didn't even have cash for the small treat their toddler was loudly demanding. (Felt really bad for the store clerks who had to rush to put abandoned things back in the freezer and refrigerator cases.)Edited: 3 years ago "
"If you choose to tip in cash, write ""cash"" on the tip line of the bill, to avoid any hanky panky."

"You are far more likely to encounter a skimmer at an ATM where you handle your card yourself than in a restaurant. I know that handing your card over in Europe is unusual, but I've never ever encountered a problem with a card after using it in a restaurant. Most credit card fraud happens when someone steals your number from the bank directly, or from use online, than from someone writing your number down when they run your card through the restaurant's centralized credit card machine. (Which is never out of the control of the restaurant's employees, unlike ATMs.) It's really a non-issue here and it's not something I would be worried about."
"Really skimmers do not need to ""take your card away"" for 15 minutes, they have an app built into the machine that can do it as easily at your table or ATM so relax guys. The advantage of credit cards is you can oppose payment, you can question every transaction and stop payment. For 2017 I think the danger is in foreigners using debit cards, they are like cash. So UK people get selves a credit card, Aussies are less stubborn about this. Credit cards are great for travel and really in general if you shop around, pay in full every month for no interest, and yes you can do this automatically. Amazon for one is really hip on charging for stuff you did not order and all I have to do is question it and Cap 1 takes care of it, I do not pay until claim is resolved."
In Dubai even if you are willing to leave your card the waiter will leave and come back with the machine to the table.I believe it would be a good idea to issue a new card just for my USA trip with a small limit since it would be devastating to lose my main card.
"Interesting thread as in the UK they allways bring a machine to you table to process the transaction. Here we're told not to let the card out of your sight. Would it be deemed ""bad form"" if you want up to the till to pay?Fleagle"
The last time I was in NY I was shocked that my card was taken from the table. It's been years since that was allowed in Canada. My mom had her card skimmed in NYC recently as did many people in the group she was travelling with.Last time I was in NYC chip and pin seemed to becoming more common so I suspect that over the next year or 2 the U.S will catch up with the rest of the world and adopt chip and pin pos machines in restaurants.
While all my cards now have a chip they do not have a pin. U stick it inside the machine instead of swiping. The waiter still takes it and sticks it in the machine. We went to a brewery on Long Island last night. They hold the credit cards until u leave. There were stacks of them. Didn't really give it any thought.Edited: 3 years ago 
This is really hysterical. Who knew there was an epidemic of waiters running credit card fraud rings on the side? This is really not an issue. It's not something to worry about.
I'm with you sh071 and post #22. I'd be horrified if my card was out of my sight. It's been years and years since that's happened in Australia or Asia. I think I'll be paying cash in restaurants when I head over soon. The hassle of having a card scammed when you're on hols is horrifying.
"Your card is far, far, more likely to be scammed when you use it online to book your hotel or when you use it in an ATM to get cash than it is when it's run through a restaurant's secure, centralized credit card machine. Feel free to use cash if you want, just recognize that that increases your risks."
"While new CC's issued here have the chips the adoption of pins is very slow (the cost of new equipment is very high for merchants) so don't expect to see it widely here anytime soon.If you're worried about CC security have a copy of all card info and customer service contact numbers (lists, photocopies or a scan in a cloud account) or leave it with a trusted person at home so you can report any loss or fraud quickly. I do this with my passport and CC info.Some CC companies offer traveler services including quick issuing of new cards. Review your accounts to see what options are available to you in the unlikely event something does happen."
"Personally, I always travel with 3 credit cards and carry certified copies of all necessary and documents. I think you'd be crazy not to."
"Re Post 28: I had my card held on for the evening at a club we were at last week. It was a little disconcerting just because I hadn't done that before, and once I got back to the hotel I had a moment where I thought I hadn't got it back. I had! The server was more on the ball than I was. It's been quite some time since we've had to let the card leave the table in Canada as well. But I'm old enough to still remember how it's done, so it's not a big deal.I suppose if you are younger and from somewhere that chip & pin has been a fact of life for some time, having your card taken away will seem unusual. It's really nothing to worry about, but good to ask the question, because a person not expecting it would be plenty worried the first time a server up and leaves with the card."
I am surprised with many replies stating it is costly for merchants to replace their credit card machines. I did some online search and each wireless machine costs between 50-300 USD. How could that be of a burden ?I have one question though. My card is chipped and requires a PIN. Is swiping only enough for the transaction to execute ?
"Also, be aware that some restaurants will automatically charge you the tip (gratuity) if you have a large group. Usually 8 or more. Look at your bill carefully if more than 6."
"Lots of merchants have switched to the chip machine, but the credit card companies do not issue a pin. It reads the chip instead of a swipe. Pin numbers are only used if paying by debit card, not credit."
"On a recent trip I was in two cities. I used a credit card once in the first city, but not at all in the second city. The card was in my handbag at all times. A few weeks later purchases were made on the card on the second city. Luckily the bank flagged these purchases as suspicious and contacted me. When I asked how this was possible, they said that there is technology that reads cards from a distance."
It's not simply a matter of plugging in a new machine.The changeover cost to merchants are estimated to be Billions (and their liability for fraud losses might be less)https:/…
"Kaye, I disagree with many things mentioned in this article. Chip transactions took 10 seconds (Which is really nothing) more back in the early days (3-5 years back) but all machines I use on daily basis now executes the transaction ""instantly"" after I press the enter button.Also claims that clients wouldn't memorize their PINs is a joke. Everyone on this planet who carries an ATM card has a PIN, I have never heard of anyone forgetting their PIN they use to withdraw money with, most people set their credit card PINs the same as their ATM cards.Back to the cost, billions is an exaggeration, and supposedly, it's just peanuts for a market with the size of the US. As I told you, the machines cost is very low. Some banks in our area will upgrade all machines for merchants for free.The only thing that makes sense in this article is about tipping (which is almost non existence elsewhere in the world in the same way it is in the USA) so perhaps merchants are indeed worried about tips.Btw, when customers pay 20% tip for instance, how much of those actually goes to waiters ?"
When people use the chip cards in my town it takes forever.Everyone just stands around waiting for something to happen.The only time my card was compromised was at a hotel in NYC which was swiped for incidentals. The swipe was done in front of me. Apparently I spent $600.00 in a bar in Florida while I was in New York. The credit card company removed the charge immediately.I have used the card literally thousands of times across the US with no other problems. You all just need to relax.
"Never underestimate the desire of businesses to avoid spending one single penny of unnecessary extra cost if they can avoid it (at least here) ""Some banks in our area will upgrade all machines for merchants for free."" Perhaps - but even without set-up costs - what kind of contract must they enter, what are the ongoing costs to the merchant and is that less than the merchant's liability risk if they don't upgrade?If each and every cash register line in the US has to spend ~$300+ to upgrade it will come to billions.Not saying they shouldn't invest in the new technology but the merchants interests and the banks interests are different from the consumers interests in this case.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Just out of curiosity, how do you people, who don't have a pin or even a chip on your card, manage when you go abroad? Do you get a pin or how do you pay? Here everything is based on a pin, I think it's maybe six years ago I have last signed anything? Also any transaction up to 25€ is payable by just ""beeping"" your card against the machine, no pin needed. At the beginning the clerks were able to override the pin and you could use your card by signing your name, but that isn't the case anymore. Or perhaps it is possible, but just not done/needed? Anyway, what does a person, who doesn't have a pin for their card do when travelling? #curious"
"We can ask our banks to assign us a pin number, but it's not entirely seamless https:/…chip-pin-cardsWhen cards expire here they have been issuing cards with chips bit they are ""chip and signature"" for the most part.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I'm with the ""much adieu about nothing"" crowd here. I have had credit cards since I was 19 years old and have never had a problem with fraud. Not saying it doesn't/can't happen but it's miniscule compared with the billions of transactions performed every day.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Post 25 recommends getting a credit card with a small limit when traveling to the U.S. Keep in mind that hotels and rental car companies put a temporary hold on a certain amount of money on your card when you check in or when you pick up the car to cover ""incidentals"" that were not disclosed on check out or return of a rental car. The amount varies with the company and the estimated amount of the bill and could be in the hundreds of dollars. If all goes well, the hold is cancelled within a day, but this also varies by company. If you are not aware of this practice, which I think is universal among U.S. hotels and rental car companies, you may get a big surprise using that credit card for purchases in shops and restaurants if the card is declined for lack of funds"
"You guys are really being hysterical over nothing, I agree with Scott and Brooklyn Bridge here. There is a miniscule chance you will be defrauded and it can happen when the card is swiped or used online, there is no waiter cabal robbing you. There is more likely a waiter cabal griping about non-tipping foreigners or the famous 10%-ers. Just tip 20% please on your card or cash. Check your card statement and just do not pay any unauthorized charges such as a meal in Alaska when you are in New York. Seriously you all are fussing over something that pretty well never happens."
"A serious question - what if it's crap service (and it must happen at times)? What do you tip then? If it's for a 'service"", do you tip accordingly?"
If there is inappropriate service 1) don't assume it's the servers fault - it may be the fault of the kitchen or management 2) speak to the server. If they can't correct it speak to the manager. Leaving a low tip or no tip simply reinforces the unflattering stereotypes about foreign travelers and doesn't get you proper service.
"So you're, irrespective of service, people tip 20%? Sorry, i just want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. I have a 10 week trip coming up and want to do the right thing!"
Chances are very good you won't have bad service. Tips are the server's main source of income.
"Th only reason you would tip less is if you receive really poor service - that is the wait staff is surly, gives you the wrong food, drops messy things on you or ignores your requests. And in that case I would also complain to the manager and leave a note to the waitperson with a 10% tip.Also - do not punish the wait staff if the food is bad. That is not their fault - it's the chef. And for that too you should both tell the wait staff and discuss with the manager.In my experience wait staff bad enough to reduce their tip is very rare, although it's possible. We eat out a lot and have this happen only once every couple of years. And usually find it is a place new to us that we do not go back to."
Thanks nytraveller :) Appreciate that advice.
"""Th only reason you would tip less is if you receive really poor service - that is the wait staff is surly, gives you the wrong food, drops messy things on you or ignores your requests. And in that case I would also complain to the manager and leave a note to the waitperson with a 10% tip.""Why would that deserve any tip at all?? Fortunately I've never had any of these events happen to me. But if I did I would speak to management and expect a bill if ""zero"", with the same amount left as a tip. Have you actually had surly staff dropping food in your lap? And it wasn't even the food you ordered? :) Did they drop ""your"" food in someone else's lap?"
"""A serious question - what if it's crap service (and it must happen at times)? What do you tip then? If it's for a 'service"", do you tip accordingly?""It does happen. But it's so rare. Literally in decades of dining out, all over the USA, there have been 3 occasions when I didn't tip.Two of them readily come to mind. I say 3 because I think there was another time but the specifics escape me. So the chances that you'll encounter one during a holiday of a couple weeks are pretty remote. Unless you spend your time analyzing every action of every server. Which doesn't seem like a great way to have a relaxing meal.Just leave 15% . Or 20%. Either one. Then get on your way and enjoy your holiday. (Unless you have that less than 1% chance of having some bizarre event of a server dumping food in your lap and ignoring you lol).Edited: 3 years ago "
"Thanks IrishFan. The States has such a good reputation for customer service, I'm not expecting to have any issues - but just wanted to understand the custom.I have 10 weeks travelling around, probably two meals out a day. Except for two weeks eating at the US Open tennis and about half a dozen other sporting events, I expect all the food will be good. My expectation of food at sporting events around the world isn't high :-) Paris is the only place that hasn't disappointed there!"
"""Not quite You get a bill, you give them your card, they take the bill and card and swipe the card, they bring you a receipt and you write the tip and sign. You have a customer copy too for your records""Exactly this!!"
So just to check - when you initially get the bill you don't add the tip then - only after you get your card back right before you leave?? I don't want to accidentally look like I'm not leaving a tip! Also what is the procedure in a deli or other place where you order and pay at the counter? Thanks and sorry if this seems silly!
">>>So just to check - when you initially get the bill you don't add the tip then - only after you get your card back right before you leave?<<<That's correct. You get back your card with the actual credit card receipt (one copy for the restaurant, one for you). You add the tip to the restaurant's copy, total it, and then sign.If you're paying by card at a counter/takeout place, you just hand it to the person at the register and they will run it right there. You can add an (optional) tip before signing, or (more common) just leave some cash in the tip jar."
I have tiped less than ten percent on occasions when the service was bad and up to 35% when everything went well. Twenty percent across the board makes no sense to me.
