"Latest statement from company now not taking bookings until 1st Nov. We are booked to go 3rd July, wasn’t expecting it but looks like this a def a no.Beginning to look like 2020 is off for holidays. :("
They may be consolidating resorts due to low demand.
"It's saying on their website that the bookings have been paused temporarily. So things may change but there is still a chance however slim. Coming from the UK the biggest problem will be getting a flight. Also some of the hotels in the complex are still taking bookings for an earlier date. - Bahia Principe Grand Coba - stays available from August 1- Bahia Principe Luxury Akumal - stays available from June 15- Bahia Principe Luxury Sian Ka’an - stays available from November 1- Bahia Principe Grand Tulum - stays available from November 1https://www.bahia-principe.com/en/covid-19/…Edited: 7:28 am, May 05, 2020 "
"This doesn’t look good. We are booked to stay at Akumal in September, expecting to have the facilities of 4 hotels. I know these are exceptional circumstances but will be looking to rebook/cancel."
This is what I expect to see at a lot of the big chains. They aren't going to open the entire complex or all of their hotels until they have the demand for it.
The resorts that are consolidating show that they place profits over social distancing and guest health. That's quite sad.
Not unexpected but sad as when you pay this price you expect all facilities. As keen as we are to return I think for us it will Be 2021 when hopefully all 4 open as normal.
"kilarneyvt - it's a tough tightrope, but assuming bookings are low (e.g. if the combined resort is consistently under 50%), I don't think it's inappropriate to consolidate and still have social distancing."
We were due to fly out end of September for 2weeks to the Coba but what we have been told by TUi it doesn't look like our Hol will be going a head. Let's hope if the no fly ban is lifted and international boarders reopened they get a chance to fill our flight a little more for it to go! Saying that if social distancing on flights goes ahead it won't be viable to do long all flights.
"Forget 2020.Until a vaccine is found,air travel resumes and cross border tourism returns this could go on for a very long time."
"Just seen on the BBC News (UK) Government ministers are saying no international holidays for the rest of this year from the UK. Hopefully try and get to Tulum and Coba again next year all being well. Mind you with the new messures hotels are putting in, RUI in our case it wouldn't have really been a relaxing holiday not anyones fault so not having a go.Stay safe folks and hope to see you in Mexico next year."
You're going to see a lot of the mega resorts only opening parts of their resorts. Going to resemble ghost towns.
Yeah it's looking likely that summer foreign holidays are going to be a no go for UK travellers.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52632976
"se are booked for 24 July, Tui claimed to us it was open, and we would be going.......not impressed, current situation is not advising travel!"
We went to the Bahia complex in 2009 summer during the swine flu epidemic. Only the Akumal section was open. Some of the ala-cart rest were open in the other sections. it was fine.
I just heard that Coba guests will NOT be able to visit the renovated Tulum sectionPerhaps Tulum wil be elevated to a higher standard (Luxury??)
"Good Morning ! My research, has suggested as referred to Trip Central Canada and Air Transat . July opening for Airlines to Cancun . Bahia Akumal and Coba open July 3 ,Sian Kaan and Tulum open Nov 3 . Akumal Beach and Wellness open July 3 . Air Canada , West Jet and Air Transat all flying to Cancun at this time at normal pricing [ $ 500 return to Toronto] . I believe most of the World will be open for Travel in July and Vaccines this Winter . Please remember that this Virus as the many Viruses have always been with us and many people die every year, such is life . I receive a Vaccine every Fall because I have worked in Emerg , Respiratory Medicine for 45 years { Thus Standing Orders]. "" Live with Wisdom , Travel with Safety"""
"Please see my post of yesterday under, Tui Terms and Conditions . It is in the Quintana Roo Forum."
"The fastest a vaccine has ever been invented is 4 years. There are more resources being put behind this, but nobody should bank on a vaccine being available this coming winter. Whatever you book, make sure that it can be cancelled, and make sure it’s with a company that will not be going bankrupt."
^^^^^^^^^This.
