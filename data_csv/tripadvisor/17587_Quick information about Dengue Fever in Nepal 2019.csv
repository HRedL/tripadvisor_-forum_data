"First of all, no reason to panic or anything, but I definitely think people should know about this:During this year about 8000 people were hospitalized for dengue fever in Nepal. About 3900 people were diagnosed with dengue in the last 8 weeks alone. And unfortunately, it's not just the subtropical Terai that is infected, the virus is roaming in Kathmandu and Pokhara and even as high up into the mountains as Manang on the Annapurna Circuit.Dengue is spread by mosquitoes which are especially active in the morning and during the day. Not so much in the evening or at night. There is currently no vaccine and no therapy. **While a first infection is usually not live threatening to fit and healthy people, you'll end up having at least a week of very bad fever, so beware of those mosquitoes!** Wear thick clothes and repellent.The virus can't be spread human to human though.Here is a recent newspaper article on the matter:https:/…"
"Thanks for posting this, it's helpful to highlight it. Cases as high as Manang is certainly worth noting because of the possible perception there are no mosquitos at such altitudes.scoodly"
"It still monsoon, peak seasons are after the first frosts which kill the mozzies. So this high altitude dengue fever does not affect most trekkers. At low elevations protection is necessary for all. Too bad it is getting more common."
"Arkienkeli, I totally agree that most Trekkers from lets say mid of Octiber on should be safe above 3000m. However many start before that time and also many treks are especially at the beginning below that altitude.I'll start my Manaslu circuit on Oct. 5th at 700m in Soti Khola and think wearing long, thick clothes will be pain in the rear. Much less pain then getting effected but definitely annoying. And I really think areas like the lower parts of Langtang, Manaslu and the Annapurna Circuit and especially the area south of the Annapurnas between Mardi and Kopra could be affected since it can be very moist there."
"I have started a trek at c500m in March (broadly similar temps to October, I suggest) and yes, it's warm to hot and mozzies apart, shorts and t-shirts were preferred. Tightly woven but still thin and mozzie proof (arguably) clothes might work and some people use chemical repellents (I don't).You know this of course TMWSAM, just putting it out there...scoodly"
"Here are some useful info links:Mosquito management https://www.healthywa.wa.gov.au/Articles/N_R… wear long loose clothes, not just thick or close woven. Also avoid dawn and dusk outdoors where they bite the most and are active. A sleeping bag sheet is useful to cover face. I once backpacked 12 months from Bali overland to Sumatra, Malay peninsula, Thailand, India and Africa all infested with mosquitos and malaria and was on malaria drugs but the sleeping sheet, mosquito coils and covering up and avoiding dawn and dusk probably saved me.Global spread and increase of Dengue, even places like France and Hawai etc https:/…dengue-and-severe-dengueDiarrhoea illness is still a bigger concern causing 14000 premature deaths whereas Dengue is generally not fatal, see here among other issues http://www.healthdata.org/nepalEdited: 7:51 am, September 10, 2019 "
"Dengue in Nepal has also been turning up in Nepal's mountain areas, possibly due to climate change (yes Donald, it is real).No question, the beginning sections of many treks (think Manaslu) are very warm (30°C in 2017) in October. And mozzies were present.There is indeed now a dengue vaccine, but currently with very limited availability (especially for travelers):https://www.thaitravelclinic.com/blog/travel…"
"Hi, is November still at risk of Dengue? Kathmandu area."
"Climate change is one of predicted causes for disease spread and increase.November in lowlands is cooler but not enough to reduce mozzie breading that carries disease, however much less rain reducing the water for mozzies to breed in. For trekking it should be better.Generally if you notice mozzies around you then start to take precautions mentioned above."
"OP: many thanks for posting this. A friend picked up dengue in S America - not nice, at all. Mossies: most of my recent treks have been in Dec Jan, so probably the safest time of year in that regard. I do remember my feet being bitten a lot in late Oct 2005, at Tatopani on AC, and possibly earlier on (ie a bit higher, and further north)."
HiKathmandu is a relatively low area and November is not so cold so I would not rule out the risk of dengue so suggest taking the precautions below.scoodly
PS - KTM's altitude is about 1400m.
"I’ll eat my groundpad , and post a video of it , if anyone can find mosquitoes in Manang. This should be a mixup between where people get bitten and when they present symptoms - dengue incubation period up to two weeks . Or confusion over Manang village and district - district runs far lower ."
it may be better to travel during leech season then there wont be any room for mossies to get a bite
"Last trip and trek in late September and early October in Ktm and Langtang trek did not experience significant mosquito or any at all but this can be seasonal variation that year in mozzie numbers.I don’t think leaches and mozzies out-compete each other well for your blood, instead it’s both aerial and ground assault ;)"
"Mozzies anywhere near 3000 , any time of the year , anywhere on the planet would be sensational news. Compare with what the CIWEC clinic in Ktm says re malaria : ”We have not seen a single case of malaria that originated in Nepal in a traveler in the past 25 years. We believe that there is no malaria risk in Kathmandu, Pokhara or the mountain trekking areas. ”They have data , and a map (2018) , from the Nepal Health Ministery that backs this. See also the WHO 2017 malaria map for Nepal : https:/…"
"But dengue is the question here.Agree that unlikely to be mosquitoes as high as Manang. But Besisahar to Dharapani yes, Chame maybe."
"Another interesting article predicting the spread of Dengue with climate change https:/… and other articles suggesting 1400m altitude is the current limit of general mosquito activity but may increase to 2000m with changing climate further pushing the range and spread to potentially risk 90% of Nepal’s population. Manang district though mostly too big altitude has lower elevations that are susceptable to mosquito activity.Also, during warm windy conditions mosquitos can drift tens of kilometres so it is not a specific line in the sand where they are not active geographically.Mozzies are basically nature’s F22 Stealth fighters equipped with blood harvesting gear and evolved to outsmart humans including Trekkers fixated on mountain views and not what’s biting them. They seek humans and animals out at a distance by following the carbon dioxide breath trail, then heat sensors pickup body heat to aquire target and then switch to visuals for final landing. Only the female mozzie needs blood protein to lay eggs, while doing so injecting their probiscus needle regurgitating their fluids into you which contains blood stopping compound to seal the wound which can also contain disease virus and others. In addition to covering up perhaps try stop breathing and lower ones body temperature.Unless vaccine becomes more common in developing country urban and rural infrastructures it is an impossible task to eliminate stagnant standing water pools in drains, open sewers, ground levels, paving and drainage across the entire landscape where mozzies breed.Edited: 11:42 am, September 11, 2019 "
"Thanks Ali and everyone else for more Mozzie information.I'd doubt the 1400m though, since that's Kathmandus altitude and it seems to be there (even if I understand that every single infected persons there could have been infected somewhere else/lower.So the way I understand it is, that rather then the whole first week, only the first three days of a Manaslu or Annapurna Trek will be a pain in the back. From Ekle Bhatti (Manaslu Circuit ~1700m) and Tal (Annapurna Circuit ~1700m) probability of Infections should be low enough to break out shorts and shirts.Edited: 1:13 am, September 12, 2019 "

"Trekkers don’t be too alarmed but be alert and sensible. Number one stop reading regurgitated media reports of the same thing. The numbers are still in your favour and you are unlikely to be affected if you act when seeing or noticing lots of mosquitoes around you and they start biting you. One or even ten mozzie bites per time are very unlikely to give you the virus. It usually takes many dozens or hundreds of bites over longer periods of prolonged exposure such as the locals living with it all year round for weeks, months and years with no mozzie controls.I live in south west Mediterranean climate Australia, where there is large mozzie presence in summer and even spring and winter and work in government environmental health advising people about local mosquito diseases (Ross River virus that has affected 1:50 persons in swamp surrounded towns, the virus gives people a two year flu and is carried in local wildlife animals). When investigating people reporting to hospitals and finding out why they got the disease to prevent further spread, it’s usually those who spend time outdoors getting bitten for hours and don’t do anything about it like going indoors, covering up, not using repellants and coils and nets. If you do one or more of those things when noticing mosquitoes that is usually enough. While on the move trekking the mozzies won’t have a chance to bite, but when resting and still be alert, and at night while sleeping so sleep under a sheet if mozzies are present in the room. If mozzies are present carry and use mosquito coils, which kills airborne mozzies in the room.Edited: 11:26 am, September 12, 2019 "
#22 “While on the move trekking the mozzies won’t have a chance to bite”You must have encountered mosquitoes with seriously bad skills. Of course mosquitos will bite you while walking (and running).
Mosquitoes are generally slow moving so there is less chance of them having time to bite you. If anyone has experienced being severely bitten by mosquitoes while on the move they can state their experiences. If you do have problems then cover up with clothing and use repellants.
Hello. I hope you have had (are having) a wonderful trip near Manaslu. I start a trip there on November 1. Were the mosquitoes a problem on your trip? Any recommendations for minimizing problem (other than treating clothing with deet and applying to exposed skin)? Thanks very much.
"You should mostly be fine in November. There is fairly decent information on this thread already. You should definitely carry DEET but make sure there is real risk before carrying and using it on the trail. Depending upon the schedule and altitude - the showers and washing of clothing is sometimes less frequent - and you'd not want to expose your skin to too much DEET.One piece of incorrect information on this thread relates to dengue: The mosquitos which cause dengue are aedes aegypti, which bite in the day time only (dawn to dusk). So, the night time precautions listed above are not relevant to dengue."
"However, many other mosquito species associated with malaria and Japanese encephalitis and others are night time biters. So its pointless trying to predict which species will be around with which diseases and not taking precautions. At any one time or throughout the day and night there will be half dozen different mosquito species around with different biting time habits.Quote from one research article “The known malaria vectors in Nepal, Anopheles fluviatilis,Anopheles annularis and Anopheles maculatuscomplex members were recorded from 70 to 1,820 m above sea level (asl). The vectors of chikungunya and denguevirus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the vector of lymphatic filariasis, Culex quinquefasciatus, and that of Japaneseencephalitis, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, were found from 70 to 2,000 m asl in eastern Nepal. Larvae of Anopheles,Culex andAedes species were recorded up to 2,310 m asl. Only season had a significant effect on the abundance of An. fluviatilis,season and resting site on the abundance of An. maculatus complex members, and season, resting site andtopography on the abundance of An. annularis” https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303…And various species have been found up to 1700m altitude. Once again don’t panic, just be pragmatic and sensible, observe for mosquitoes flying around you and exposed skin. If seen start taking precautions under about 1500-2000m altitude. At night while you are fast asleep you may not notice them so keep windows closed and cover up. Note the risk for malaria and others at higher altitude based on reports seems low.If you think you need more information than all of above ample previous posts and info links you simply are too lazy to have read or understood them.Edited: 6:45 am, October 15, 2019 "
"You can protect against Japanese Encephalitis with a vaccine. If going to spend time in Nepal at lower elevations (e.g. Kathmandu) between August and October, it might be a good idea. Also, you can buy shirts that are pre-treated with mosquito repellants. They might be worthwhile."
