"https:/… This article seems promising, And so does all other stats seen recently. Croatia seem to only now be looking at being added to the list and its sitting at 27 per 100,000 and greece nearly half that figure in the last 7 days. I am flying out on the 27th, Is anyone flying out round about then and feeling positive?"
"We fly out to kos on 25th , I’m still very nervous as my children go back to school the day after we get back and I have an operation booked a week later so I’m keeping everything crossed that we don’t need to quarantine , unless anything changes by Friday we have decided to go and just have a good time as we wouldn’t receive a full refund if we didn’t go . After working all through the pandemic we would love to get away ."
"Hypothetically, I wonder what the gov would do if you arranged for a private test on arrival back in the UK, and all passengers were negative on that test?Technically there is no reason for your children NOT to go to school. The only issue is the governments own inadequate and incompetent protocols. Should children miss school in that scenario i.e. when they are probably the only children in the class who almost certainly don't have covid?"
The virus has an incubation period so any test may not necessarily be accurate.
"3- yes but that is the same for every scenario that involves a test, whether at home or during immigration (including into Greece)."
The U.K. government have decided that 14 days self isolation is required because of what post2 says. They’re not taking the risk that someone who has been in contact with the virus may test negative on the day they return but positive a few days later.At the moment the Greek government are doing random test of people on entry. That’s they’re call. I’m sure they understand that some who tests negative may subsequently develop the virus after entry.

"Has this been confirmed, That greece is now on the quarintine list? Surely not i have seen Experts saying that they are a long way off that, Watching nicola sturgeon talking live right now and not heard a thing about greece being added to the list.Edited: 7:36 am, August 20, 2020 "
@Marc They aren’t and they won’t be put on it. Their figures are far too low.
"No, there is no quarantine."

No quarantine at the moment but who knows what may happen in the coming weeks.
Flying to Crete 8 Sep. Just feeling anxious every day but really hoping I get. It’s not the way it should be looking forward to your holiday but it is what it is. Definitely will be going unless quarantine comes in which at the minute it doesn’t seem likely as the cases are holding their own in regards to UK requirements. Fingers crossed we all get.
I think Amomondo was commenting on the hypothetical scenario in reply #2 rather than saying people returning to the UK from Greece are required to quarantine.
"Cases do seem to be holding it down hopefully there is either a small continuous decrease of cases to stay well below the 20 per 100,000, Most people say it would need to be over 300 cases for 7 days for it to trigger the UK quarintine review. Fingers crossed but it can change at any day, 1 week countdown is on but still seems so far away."
"@Marc - we are similar to you in that we fly on the 26th and have seen the scaremonger stories doing the rounds that Greece may be on the government 'watchlist'. However - as has been said on here, the numbers are far lower than Croatia, which seems to be the only significant European holiday destination that may be added this week. Who knows what the future will bring, but I for one are now optimistic we will make it out there."
"We fly tomorrow and hopefully wont have to quarantine on return. As long as the 7 day rolling average is below 300 it keeps the 7 day average below 20 per 100,000 people which seems to be the trigger point"
"Croatia added, Portugal removed. Greece 7 day figure is now a fraction under 15. The initial figure of new cases today has been revised downwards slightly to 250.Edited: 12:15 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"Portugal ok to travel to now, how does Portugal compare to Greece figures??"
"But Croatia cases are less than Greecehttps:/…Edited: 12:29 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"@18According to the telegraph this afternoon, both Greece and Portugal were on exactly 14.7, which is pretty much around what most were getting on these forums for keeping up with the Greece figures."
PaulaC is correct - Iwas commenting on the hypothetical suggestion.It could have been better written and I’m sorry if I caused anyone concern by giving the impression that Greece is on the quarantine list
"Panitdenmark yes Croatia total number is slightly less than greece but heir population size is less than half .Greece will not be added to list any time soonEdited: 12:39 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"The transport minister makes it clear that it is not just one set of figures they look at and it could change for any country at any time.""A range of factors taken into account when JBC & Ministers assess Travel Corridors - including but not limited to: estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in a country; the level and rate of change in the incidence of confirmed positive cases; the extent of testing in a country, The testing regime and test positivity; the extent to which cases can be accounted for by a contained outbreak as opposed to more general transmission in the community; government actions; and other relevant epidemiological information"""
To me Greece does not look good.
Portugal is back on the 'No Quarantine Required' list but Austria and Croatia now require quarantine on return to the UK. No change in the status of Greece.
