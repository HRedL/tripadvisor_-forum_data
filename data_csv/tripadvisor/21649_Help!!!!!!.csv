"Hi guys,My husband is under the impression that the majority of tourists are wearing face masks in Phuket at the moment. Is this true? He has also read that some Thai official has said that tourists that don’t wear masks should he asked to leave.Having kept abreast of the virus via reliable news sources I didn’t think that the situation was quite yet this serious - maybe I have been naive.Can anyone confirm that this is indeed the case and the majority of tourists/locals in Phuket are now wearing masks?Sorry for yet another corona virus email.Kx"
False news!
Thanks Chris!!!!
"I can't comment on Phuket but I just returned from Bangkok yesterday. The vast majority of people, locals and tourists were NOT wearing masks.Edited: 4:30 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"just log into live cams and see how many are using masks -""-the proof is in the eating"" as the old saying goes"
"literally there may be 2 or 3 people wearing masks in the shopping malls. Usually foreigners / tourists.I'm flying to HK (Hong Kong - not HinKong - this being a Thai forum, easy to get confused) this morning. I will bring a mask with me to wear on the plane, in consideration to my fellow travellers - just in case the majority are wearing masks.Edited: 8:13 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"Anyone with half a brain....realizes it's all fake news. Unless in China of course......then again, it's all their version of the news.I have masks, have yet to wear, and doubt if I ever will, as can't see a situation I'd be in, that it would be needed.Edited: 8:39 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"Surgical masks do very little to protect the wearer from contracting the virus but rather will protect others if the wearer is in infected. I'm in Bangkok (non tourist area) and i would say 15% are wearing masks, many to protect against pollution (a valid reason to wear a mask) and the balance are ill-informed.Edited: 8:54 pm, February 25, 2020 "
We're in Phuket right now and hardly anyone is wearing masks. We only saw people wearing them at the airport.
"That’s great news, thanks so much for telling me. How does Phuket seem at the moment? Is it significantly quieter? Hope you have a great holiday x"
Yes quieter and the roads are great no big buses driving around and alot less minibuses.
https:/…Here now all okay40 cases in Thailand 22 recovered
"I'm currently in Phuket now and only some people are wearing masks. Problem is, we can't find places selling masks. A lot of places are selling hand sanitizer. I asked at one of the pharmacies and they had no face masks for sale.Alot of store owners and staff in restaurants and night markets are wearing masks however."
"Hi, I'm a local Thai living in Bangkok. It's pretty much true that the majority of the locals wear surgical mask. And, I believe this will happen so in other big city in Thailand. But this is ""NOT TRUE"" at all that the tourists will be asked to leave if not wearing a mask. We have no such rules and as my self living here, never heard of that. So don't worry, enjoy your tripFeel free to ask me questions :')"
"I see the Thai Health Minister has been at it again with his racist comments about farangs, saying they are all dirty and should be avoided, he was upset because one refused to take a mask he was handing out with his bare (unclean?) hands, funny he does wear a mask a lot of the time. Masks are not recommended unless you are infected or ill.Edited: 7:08 am, March 13, 2020 "
Thanks so much Fah I - that’s really kind of you Kx
