"Hi everyone, we are thinking of attending a basketball game in Chicago this Sunday. Couple of questions (I have never attended a basketball game) - Can we easily attend the arena and get tickets there, day of? We are staying at Courtyard Downtown, how would you get there (we have never used Uber)? And good food at the arena? Thanks for all your replies, in advance."
"There are 5 of us travelling together, 4 adults, 1 teen."

CTA #19 or 20 bus to the game. Google Maps will show you the way. Taxi and ride share are also available.
You can easily buy tickets on StubHub.comPrices are probably lowest the day of. Uber or bus to game. Very easy.
"Have you considered the Corona virus before going to the stadium? If so, then there are several delish places to eat in the West loop."
"As #5 suggests, the food at the United Center isn't particularly memorable, plus you are paying captive prices for it (I will pop for a beer or two however at hockey games). I'd eating somewhere downtown before heading to the UC."
"Unless something has changed recently, the food at the United Center is pretty standard arena food, so I’d eat before or after the game. Use stubhub for tickets, they’ll be reasonable. You’ll probably need Uber XL to get there with 5 people."
Take the CTA bus 19 or 20.
"No we really haven’t. I’m coming from a place with no cases, and where no one is panicking. So now you have me thinking about this trip and/or if we should be attending events with a lot of people."
"As long as no one in your group is age 60+ or has a compromised immune system, you all should be fine. Wash your hands. Don't touch your face. Standard practices during winter. Or, so I thought."
No one is panicking in Chicago either. St. Patrick's Day parade on Saturday is on.
For now. Boston cancelled their parade. Ireland banned all parades. We will see.B.
OEMC just said there's no plans to cancel. I wish they would though! So not a fan of all the wasted tourists.
The coasts are always ahead of Chicago. Even Jeopardy studio audiences are closed. Harvard is closed. And Chicago is going to let a bunch of drunk people walk/stagger/whatever around downtown. Unbelievable.
"Even if ""no one in your group is age 60+ or has a compromised immune system"" (advice of poster no. 10), you may want to think twice about attending the game if a member of your household or anyone else with whom you have frequent personal dealings fits in that category -- even if that at-risk individual will not be attending the game. If one of the attendees at the game is exposed to the virus and contracts Covid-19, even if that person has a mild case or is wholly asymptomatic, he/she will be a carrier who can pass on the disease to persons in the high risk category -- running about 12-14 days from contracting the disease, even if asymptomatic.The ""don't touch your face"" advice is great in theory. In practice, it's really hard to break yourself of that habit."
"Agree with MBA. Even if you aren't in those vulnerable groups, you could still be a carrier and infect someone. And the bottom line, whether you will die or not is beside the point. Who wants to experience a terrible flu like virus, even if you will live."
"This forum is for general travel information. It's a terrible place to get information about public health issues. If you have a question about the virus, put away the internet and call your doctor."
"Doctors are overburdened right now. Calling them to ask if you should attend a basketball game is a waste of their valuable time. If you are worried about it don't go. It is just a game - there will be lots more chances to go. B.Edited: 5:48 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Lol I didn’t bring up the virus in my post. Check out the thread. I only responded after it was brought up, stating that I was thinking over my trip now."
Good point... The internet. Home of unsolicited advice.:)B.
Virus hit downtown = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
"I cancelled our trip to Chicago, actually our trip is just on hold. Chicago is a great city, and it will still be there when we decide to come back. Thank you for all of your replies. Great forum."
"Good choice. I just wouldn't leave Canada to come to US in a health crisis. As you may have heard, healthcare in the States is not like Canada. Stay where you are for now."
Well all nba games are suspended anyways.
"Well, the NBA just announced they are suspending the season until further notice. Stay tuned."
NBA has been cancelled.
