"Hello, We've been living in WA for 15 years, traveled a lot but never been to ONP yet. Could you please tell me if going to park on Sept, 21-25 is a good idea? What do you think about staying in Port Angeles? maybe it's better to stay few days in one place and few days in another? How many days we really need to explore park and nearby area? Please any suggestions."
"Do your research. Read about the park, decide what interests you there, and then write back. There are all sorts of resources to get an idea of what ONP offers. start with a guidebook, look at the park website, and then read older threads on this forum.Edited: 9:44 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"In July 2019, my family drove to Olympic National Park and stayed 3 nights in Port Angeles as our home-base. We stayed in a nice AirBnB home. If you plan to visit Victoria, British Columbia (by ferry) as we did, then it would definitely make sense to stay in Port Angeles. I think you need at least 3-4 nights to enjoy ONP because it is a huge park that requires a lot of driving. There are so many beautiful places to see!Here is our ONP itinerary in brief. After driving up from Olympia with a stop in Sequim for lunch, we drove up to Hurricane Ridge on Day 1 (definitely worth seeing). On Day 2, we kayaked on Lake Crescent, walked in the Hoh Rain Forest, and visited Ruby Beach and Kalaloch Beach (for tide pools). On Day 3, we took the ferry for a day trip to Victoria, British Columbia (high tea, visit to the Royal BC Museum). I would recommend making Port Angeles your home base in you plan to do the ferry ride to Victoria. Otherwise, it makes sense to split your ONP trip by staying in two different locations. Hope this is helpful.Edited: 11:47 pm, August 06, 2020 "
You can't take the ferry to Victoria. There is no ferry right now because it has closed down during the epidemic. Canada has also closed its border to the United States because they view us as the world's biggest petri dish.
"Thank you for your reply. We were in Victoria many times in the past already. We also will stay near Port Angeles. I wanted to split between Port Angeles and Forks for shorter commute, but because of covid-19 we decided to stay in one place where we will have an entire place for us for 4 nights. You did so many things on day 2. From our base to rain forest about 2 hours of driving and we will come Sept 21-25 so daytime will be shorter, so not sure we well be able to see many things as you saw."
"Nadia, what is it you want to see?"
"We just booked a stay so I just start planning. Lake crescent, hurricane ridge, rain forest, maybe beaches, waterfall, animals. it will be my husband vacation so it shouldn't be hard to do, so some easy and moderate hikes. I see many places are closed this year."
"Late September is a good time for the Hoh Rain Forest. The vine maples flame into color at this time, the weather is usually decent, and the crowds have died down. The Hoh RF is the only rain forest close enough to Port Angeles for you to visit. It is a 2 hour drive, each way, of course, from Port Angeles. Port Angeles is the best base for Hurricane Ridge, which is also beautiful and less crowded in late September. Read about the Hurricane Hill Trail.The only beach that will be open to you is Rialto Beach, which is 90 minutes from PA. It is very lovely, but it has been horribly crowded this year due to Covid related closures of other beaches. Parking there can be a problem because one of the two lots is shut down due to Covid. If you go, try to arrive close to low tide.Your best bet for an impressive waterfall is Sol Duc Falls, one hour from Port Angeles. Bring a mask. The trail to the falls is not wide enough to stay 6 feet apart from other visitors, and it may be crowded.It is hard to spot animals in ONP, partly because much of it is heavily wooded, but elk are commonly seen along the road to the Hoh Rain Forest visitor center, especially in the early morning and the late afternoon. I have seen bears on Hurricane Ridge, but only at a distance. I have seen river otters in various places along the shore. One ran out of the surf with a fish in his mouth at Rialto Beach. He stopped, looked at all the people on the beach, turned around and headed back into the water."
"Thank you very much, Kaleberg."
"Kaleberg, could you please explain? I checked tide schedule. On Sept 23 Rialto beach has low tide @ 11:36am and high tide @ 5:32pm. Never had tide experience before. I understand that we should come by 11:30am. But when we should safely leave that beach?"
"You will be completely safe 24 hours a day, even at high tide. The only reason I said that you should go around low tide is that the wonderful tide pools are visible at low tide, and they get covered up a higher tides. You have nothing to fear."
