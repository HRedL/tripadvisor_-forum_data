"Hello! I am planning a trip to Hawaii for me and my boyfriend and am very eager to go snorkeling and swim in majestic waterfalls!! We are going to be there (if all goes well) at the end of May with half our time on the east side of the island and the other half on the west. Any local tips on where some secluded, romantic, snorkeling spots, and more secluded waterfall spots may be and or how to best find these? Thank you.Sasha"
"Tip - forget waterfall swimming. Aside from flash floods, rock falls and private property there is a real possibility of contracting leptospirosis.Secluded snorkle spots really do not exist. Get a good guide book and use that as a starting point"
"Save the romance for indoors. Waterfalls can have rocks tumbling on you or leptospirosis. Snorkeling spots that are good have people. Not throngs, but not secret spots."
"At this point, I would not plan a trip for the end of May, due to COVID-19 concerns."
"Honu is right, the “good” places will have people. Because they’re good places.There are no “hidden gems” anymore, thanks to the Internet. Anything still considered “hidden” is on private property or dangerous to access...or both!"
"If safe to travel by the end of May, I suggest that you check out Makalawena. It's a beautiful beach with soft, powdery white sand and tourquoise water. I don't know about the snorkeling; it's just a beautiful beach. Usually very few people there because most people don't want to do the 20-30 minute hike across the black lava. Just be aware that there is no shade, and carry plenty of water.,"
"Total seclusion should not be expected but remote helps. Basically places people have to walk to w/o car access. As for ""planning"" best bet is to wait. Labor Day week is typically a good time to be less crowded & hopefully virus scare will be resolved by then."
Ok thanks for all your input this is helpful. Places you have to walk to and such that makes sense. I will seek these sort of spots out. And what is this disease from water you speak of!?!
"https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/index.htmlIt can be found in a lot of freshwater sources. Basically if you're swimming under a waterfall you have to remember that the water coming to you is coming through a forest with all kinds of animals living in/near the water source and doing what animals do when they live near water which means you have no idea how much animal waste is actually getting washed along.Your risk is minimized if you don't have any open wounds and you don't swallow any water, etc...but water always gets in somehow whenever I go swimming. :)"
Leptospirosis - you get it from fresh water - especially in the tropics:  https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/index.html
And you also need to research Rat Lungworm.
"Don't think you get rat lung from a waterfall or snorkeling.Loads of other things to be aware of which is why I suggested a good guide book, far to many to list here."
"Actually, you can get rat lungworm from ponds and streams, which is what I meant. Sorry I didn't specify last night. Rats, pigs, and more have been shown to carry RL. If they have pooped or gone into a pond or stream, they can infect the snails there and onward to you.....plus just slugs living on the banks or in vegetation near ponds etc.The BI has huge issues with RL."
"we go to a couple remote spots for snorkeling, one in Puakobut the entries through the lava are difficult and not a lot of people around if you need helpbest to stick with the well known spots for safety and still plenty to see"
"Most of Hawaii is romantic without any requirement for seclusion. When two people are in love, their focus is on each other, not the others around them. You can have a romantic dinner in an ordinary restaurant, a romantic outing on a boat with other passengers along, a romantic day at a beautiful Hawaiian beach even though there are others playing in the water or walking by on the sand. It's what you communicate to each other with your eyes, your thoughts, your words, your deeds, while sharing new experiences that helps make the moment magical. I suggest strolling through Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens together 90 minutes before closing time.Edit: And I mean when it becomes safe to travel again.Edited: 1:41 am, March 19, 2020 "
