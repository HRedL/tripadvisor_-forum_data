Has anyone heard any new news on the beach restoration project? I wasn't sure if this whole swine flu epidemic has put a damper on the plans to begin in July.

Thanks CancunMole!
"1.- Well, insofar as the money for the project comes from beachfront businesses like hotels, marinas and restaurants, yes, the project has been affected by swine flu, rumours of violence in Cancun and the overall global economic situation.2.- The Environmental impact study is only about half finished--the analysis, not the presentations.3.- There is some doubt as to whether they will be able to use the Cozumel sand bank for the needed sand. There was a public meeting the other day where both sides (the government and Hoteliers vs Ecologists) presented their point of view--mainly to each other since basically no one else showed up. Before they decide, they want to see the results of the Environmental impact study.4.- The announcement of the winning bidder for the project has been postponed twice now and the last I heard was until June 9.Now, all of that has to be done and agreed upon so they can start on June 15! Yeh, right! Maybe June 15--but not 2009."
"Well I know on the Cancun forum people said they would still come to Mexico beach or not. I know I would not come with out the beach. But obviously there are so many die hearts that would still come down why should the hotels really care about the beach. I mean look at the people that come now for beaches that are so roccky in places you cant use them, or with so many sand whales you cant get around them. A few tequilas who cares. I say save the money Mexico, dont do the beaches, let them be natural. Than we will see if the people who said they would still come down really will. I doubt it! And I doubt the beach recovery will even make it this year, possibly if there is a beach to recover they will do it next year."
"I got back yesterday from a great week in Cancun! The beaches are disappearing... Spoke with an executive from the Royal Resorts that has taken a big hit because of beach erosion.... He told me there are numerous proposals on the table from various organizations in accordance with the Mexican govt and the hotels to solve the problem... The top one they are looking at now is developing a artificial reef from old train cars... This will slow the waves and totally calm the seas.... He said they will implement probably 3 of the ideas to help the situation and everything should begin after hurricane season which emds in late November.... So we will have a beach again next year! Regardless, Cancun Rocks!!!"
"Dont sweat it... I just got back on Saturday with my wife and 6 of our friends... We had the time of our lives... It was awesome.. Service was amazing.... I have been to Cancun 17 times and love it everytime but this was the best... As for the beach some had beach some not so much, seems to be a yearly thing don't stress it the pool is always there!!! Also NOONE was sick! Only swine effect was that we ate and drank like PIGS!!! Enjoy!!!"
