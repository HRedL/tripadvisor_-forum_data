Let the buzz begin!!! Whos going nxt few days
Hi. We fly on Monday for 3 nights. Soooooo excited. ❤ benidorm x
Hi! Let's keep fingers crossed that the flights aren't cancelled.
We are flying out next Thursday. Part of me is still undecided if we will go or think it could get cancelled.
Looks like Spain maybe going same way as Italy.No flights in.Spain on lockdown.
MagoWhere did you find that info or is it a prediction?
#5....mag61...Spain is not on lockdown..what a ridiculous thing to say at this time!!Steve
"Hi mag61,Untrue and a very irresponsible posting.At least 3 flights from Manchester have landed in Alicante this morning."
"For everyone's information, Spain is now reported to be the second worse Country for the virus after Italy. I live in a small Spanish town in the Provence of Alicante and it's here. Schools and all public events are shut. I don't go out unless it's really necessary. It must be really disappointing for people who have booked a holiday, but you have to decide for yourself."
"Steve, just because it looks like 'business as usual' doesn't mean anything. This virus is fast spreading and a lot of people that visit Benidorm are older or have compromised immune systems. Just like Italy it's going to get worse. Like I said everyone has to make their own decision. I know what mine would be, but I'm in a vulnerable age group. Of course 'everything is open' people have a living to make, so I can understand why they stay open."
"Hi Barbara A,You have made your opinion patently obvious, having posted on several threads with the same comments.What you haven't made clear is that IN EUROPE the number of reported cases in Spain is second only to Italy.I'm 65 and have Type 2 diabetes, but that won't stop me from visiting Benidorm in 11 days.The risk of infection in Benidorm is no greater than the risk in the UK.Edited: 6:45 am, March 13, 2020 "
"What's your point ?? As I live here and get up to date information I am trying to inform people with the FACTS. You also have given your opinion on a lot of threads here. I don't agree with you, but your entitled to your opinion AS AM I."
How nany reported cases in Benidorm? Do you have that fact?
"Firstly lets address what I've said. The information I have given is from the Generalitat Valenciana, of which Benidorm is in. I have not at any time said there are cases in Benidorm. In the Valencian region there are 94 cases 1 death and 2 in intensive care. I have posted that Spain is now reported to be second to Italy for Corona Virus. Given that Italy is on lockdown, I would have thought if you had more than one braincell, you could see how fast this virus is spreading. My little Spanish town (an hour away from Benidorm) has closed all amenities and schools. This is also true for the whole of Spain. Fiestas are postponed. This is the information I have given. I have not at any time told anyone not to go to Benidorm, and I have said we must all make our own choices. You seem to take some sort of offence at this, by your accusations of me posting on different threads (as you have done) and challenging what I've said. Unlike you, I wanted to inform people what is happening in Spain so they can make their own decisions. The situation in Spain is serious and the virus is spreading fast. So 'you' do whatever you want. I hope it works out for you. But I would appreciate it if you would stop trying to make an argument out of something so serious. By the way, I am entitled to post on as many threads as I choose, just like you without remarks such as you have made. Bye."
"Bigcol, you are in the U.k and not here in Spain, everything that Barbara has said is how it really is.Benidorm is full of tourists who just want to have a good time and enjoy them selves. I would normally go to Benidorm for the fallas and st Patrick's day but will be ad hearing to the advice to stay away from such gatherings."
"Hi!I am not saying that Barbara is being untruthful. Both of you reside in Spain and are recting to the situation as residents. It must be a very anxious time for you.I'm in the cold, wet UK and I need my week in the sun. I won't be joining in any large gatherings.This is a Benidorm forum, so members want information about that town. At the moment there doesn't seem to be any reported cases in Benidorm, and while I understand that the situation in the province will eventually have a knock-on effect, at the moment there is no reason to cancel very expensive holidays.I stress - at the moment.P.S. I apologise to Barbara if I have given offence. I noted that, until today, Barbara had made no contributions to any forum, but then had put almost identical postings on several threads. This seemed odd to me. However, this does not retract from my sincere apology.Edited: 9:12 am, March 13, 2020 "
Steve where did I say Spain IS on lockdown?I said looks like maybe it's going sameway as Italy.
Bigcol read my post properly.I didn't say flights were not coming in I said MAYBE
"mag61,The wording of your post suggested that there were no flights into Spain and that Spain was on lockdown.Two other members read it in exactly the same way, so it's not just me."
Flying in the morning
"There should have been no gap after first piece of post.It should have been.....maybe same way as Italy,no flights in and on lockdown.My fault."
But you actually posted No flights in Spain on lockdown which is a totally different statement. People should be careful with what they post as some others believe everything they read.
"Foreign Office has now changed its advice and is advising against all but essential travel to the regions of Madrid, La Rioja and the municipalities of La Bastida, Viotir and Mirande de Ebro. The Spanish Government is expected to declare a state of emergency."
Thanks Sunlover.Spain At last someone with common sense.
President Pedro Sanchez has now officially declared Spain to be in an emergency state of alarm.
"Post 18: ""I won't be joining in any large gatherings."" You are going to Benidorm, by default you will be in a 'large gathering' but you may want to review your travel plans now that bars and restaurants close at midnight tonight for the foreseaable future,"
"MarkinAlicante,Picky, picky!"
All Bars and Restaurants closing at Midnight. Still coming ????
Not at all bigcol but if I was Covid-19's target market I would not be quite so bullish about travelling. Each to their own.
Totally agree MarkinAlicante. Some people just don't get it and are rude when they don't.
"Again, two posters who reside in Spain - you have a totally different viewpoint from UK holidaymakers."
"Hello big col, i for one would hope against all odds you get to go away if not now soon after, and the same to others who maybe were or are travelling soon.Atb steve"
I’d be guided by people who live there because holidaymakers want things to be ok whilst the residents know whether they’re ok. I’d hate to contract the virus there and be stuck in a hotel room.Jules
"bigcol - I am also a holidaymaker, I have a holiday to Thailand booked but because I live in Spain currently I cannot travel there. What is so wrong, in your opinion, with the views of people who live in the area that you are planning to travel to? Just because they don't fit your views does that make them wrong?"
Are bars really closing tonight at midnight ?
Yes bars closing at midnight tonight for the next 14 days minimum. My mate works in a Benidorm bar and has confirmed it.Steve
"Re: Bigcol, #33>>>Again, two posters who reside in Spain - you have a totally different viewpoint from UK holidaymakers.<<<There are a few on here who also reside in Spain. Just because you were getting the answers you wanted to hear from some and not the others. Does not mean the answers you wanted to hear were correct, and those giving different answers incorrect. They were only trying to help and advise.Does not look like anyone is going anywhere now. I suppose a determined person could try to travel but would they be insured or safe? State of emergency brings with it very many emergency laws and restrictions."
"Hi jeny5,I haven't been seeking answers, nor have I been rejecting the advice that I want to hear.Surely a person who has forked out several hundred pounds has a totally different viewpoint to a resident of the region?This is supposed to be a travel forum, not a medical advice forum.Heard nothing from my carrier about my flight and holiday. Nothing online sbout hotels closing.Edited: 2:11 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Will you still go Col with the bars etc. shut down?I don’t think you’ll find anything online because measures seem to happen quickly and closures come unexpectedly. Jules
"It is quite common for some people to respond to a potentially dangerous situation by denial, a well-known primitive defense mechanism. Thousands of infected patients, hundreds of deaths. No, no, they say, not in Benidorm. Maybe somewhere else but not here. They simply refuse to accept the obvious. And the obvious thing is that the virus affecting the town is a question of time. Like somebody said on this forum, Benidorm is not in a bubble. So sooner or later it will come. I had planned to go there in summer, now I’m going to cancel the trip. Not because I’m phobic or something. It’s just common sense. It is those who deny what is happening are reacting in a neurotic way."
"Hi jules,Of course I will go, as long as the hotel restaurant serves meals and the bar serves drinks.The sun will still shine on the pool area. We don't wander around much so we will be delighted to stay in the hotel.There may be no evening entertainment, but that's a small disappointment."
"Hi willyandclark,I am just as likely to become infected in the UK as I am in a hotel in Benidorm."
Think you could end up confined to your hotel room.
"Hi PWag,Bring it on! Nice balcony in the sun - great!"
"There are far more cases in Spain and as such, as it stands at the moment , you are more likely to get infected in Spain. That is why the measures been taken are far more severe than the UK currently."
"Hi Buyurun,Not if I am not out and about in Benidorm. In the hotel the likelihood of infection is the same as in the UK."
"All those getting out of Madrid quickly before the lockdown. Where do think they have all gone. Holiday by the seaside. Morocco has stopped all sailings to Spain, perhaps ask why."
"Hi bigcol,Your decision, of course. But it sounds like a call for “a feast in time of plague”, if you see what I mean."
"Hi BigCol,I’m not sure I follow your logic or where you would get those kind of figures from."
bigcol…..I think you'll need to sprout a pair of wings.
"Hi Buyurun,Based upon my last visit to the hotel, the majority of guests were from the UK. There is no restriction on travel or gatherings in the UK, so if I am in a hotel with chiefly Brits, it's no different to being in a restaurant or pub at home.Out by the pool, where I will spend most of the day, I won't be close enough to anyone to worry about infection."
"Hi PamelaH,????"
"Hi BigCol,They will be guests that have travelled through airports and sat on planes, and been in contact with more people with a higher rate of infection than in the UK. All of which means that the hotel guests (even if they are British) have a higher risk factor. Never mind the staff. I still don’t follow your thinking. It is without doubt, according to the evidence at hand, more likely that you will have a higher risk of infection in Spain than in the UK. PS. All this could well change in the near future."
"Hi Buyurun,I welcome your concern and acknowledge your arguments."
"Hi BigCol,I appreciate your polite manner - which is evident in all your posts."
Things are changing by the minute and normally not for the better. I''m due to travel there in a few weeks but at present can't see that happening. I'd hate to get there and find everything closed as I have heard. I'd hate it more to get infected out there and have to stay longer in isolation missing my flight home. Where would you stay if your hotel booking is ended and where would you get food/drinks etc ? Better be at home where I have everything I need.
