"Hello. I will be in Rio de Janeiro for 12 days end of October & beginning of November. I will be staying at Grand Mercure Hotel Riocentro in Barra da Tujica. Do I need to use insect repellent all the time ??? the swimming pool is on the 10th floor, do I need to use insect repellent sitting near the pool, & take a shower before swimming because it is toxic ?? Also if I am walking in the area I need to use it ??? How bad the mosquitoes at this time . Do I need to wear long trousers & socks going to Christ Redeemer or is it OK to wear long shorts & sandals.Do I need it there also. It is toxic. Thank you for your help"
Your question regarding the hotel will be best answered by contacting the Grand Mercure Hotel Riocentro.Re Christ the Redeemer: I would recommend trousers and socks if you're reluctant to use repellents.
Thank you for your reply.
"weather plays alot in mosquitos and if they are active or around.Many times if its ""windy"" you wont notice them. That is until you go inside or someplace where there is no breeze.I was in Rio last late Sept. I didnt notice them until i got into my apartment. I did bring wipe on repellants, but i didnt use any. You can also buy and use sprays to use on your clothes but be careful with use since some are not suppose to be used on your skin. If you decide to use anything read the instructions.most repellants are not good for anything living. there are natural repellants like citronella oils and such, but what i have found is that they dont last as long if any and if they work is questionable. Also, from my experience in general to all repellants is that what may work for some person may not work for you. Readup on the many repellants and see what the reviews say.you can get stuff locally if you are concerned."
"Thank you for your response .I have OFF , I bought it before when I went to Kuching Malaysia, but I did not need it there. I stayed in the city. It was too humid for me. I see pictures of people wearing shorts & sleeveless shirts. They use insect repellents to be able to wear such clothes ?? Is it that bad ???"
Definitely not as bad as media pictures and many people wearing shorts and shirts are not using any repellent. I particularly used on my first days and ended up forgetting after a while.
"Thank you, that is reassuring, because the repellents are toxic & you need to wash your hands before eating."
"If you're not going to stay more than a few days and have no medical restrictions, you can have some drops of propolis every day. And use repellents normally, not at pool or places like that.It's easy to find natural lemonades everywhere so always have some, asking less suggar on them.If you stay many days, don't have propolis for all of them, stop for a few days and then again have some for some more days.Do not use long clothing, but take some repellent with you."
"I just read about a new insect repellent Kite Patch that does not use toxic chemicals. huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/06/kite-patch_n_3â€¦ The patch isn't available yet but it sounds promising. The company website shows a spray, but I'm not sure what the relative effectiveness is compared to the upcoming patch."
I must be incredibly lucky--I have never received one mosquito bite in 6 visits to Rio....in the Caribbean and Miami they are all over me like lint on a cheap suit.
"Elchevere, yo tampoco! :)"
"Thank you all, I am already in Rio, I sprayed once only when going to Christ Redeemer. I saw flies, definitely better than advertised. No need to worry."
Wafa H: Thanks for the update.
"With the start of summer and the warmer, more humid weather descending on Rio de Janeiro, state authorities are starting to worry about diseases caused by the Aedes Aegypti mosquitos. Rio Officials worry about a Chikungunya Virus epidemic:http://bit.ly/2h1scPG"
"The biggest challenge for Brazil today in the health sector is the combat against the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya, said Brazilian Health Minister Ricardo Barros on Monday. Barros also voiced his concern for the forecast of an increase in cases of the Chikungunya virus, during the 2016-2017 summer season.http://bit.ly/2htDZLx"
Health Secretary warns that Chikungunya could infect half of Rio:http://bit.ly/2iAdT9c
"Brazilian scientists on Tuesday began unleashing the first of millions of mosquitoes infected with bacteria meant to prevent the insects from transmitting the dengue virus to humans.Thousands of Aedes Aegyptus mosquitoes carrying the bacteria were released in front of journalists by scientists from the Fiocruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro.The hope is that they will then breed and spread the bacteria, denting the insect population's ability to spread dengue and other viruses including Zika and Chikungunya.Fiocruz plans to release 1.6 million infected mosquitoes a week, later stepping that up to three million.""We found that when an Aedes Aegyptus mosquito has the bacteria, the capacity of the mosquito to transmit viruses like dengue, Zika and Chikungunya is blocked or reduced,"" said the head of the dengue program at Fiocruz, Luciano Moreiro.""So the idea is that when they are released, they will transmit this, as if they were immunizing the other mosquitoes and therefore transmission will be reduced."""
Nice to hear.I just bought 2 OFF lotions for my 4 days in Manaus/Amazon. I read some said they used a lot in just a day. But even the Amazon tour owner Im going for told me to wear long sleeves.Glad I dont need it in Rio as someone said.
