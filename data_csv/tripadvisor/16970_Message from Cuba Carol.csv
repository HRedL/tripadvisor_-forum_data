"Hi All ,Received an e-mail from CC she asked me to let you all know to buy your pesos at the airport as the guests are being short changed at the cadecas and the resorts. Just passing it on. She is having a marvelous time at Mayanabo Annia is treating her like royalty so, so kind to her."
Scams and Ripoffs are spreading like a epidemic . Truely is sad . Johnny C
I guess somethings never change to bad that they keep these creeps working in these Cadecas ....
"Yeah Gato, I know what you mean. But it is up to the traveller to keep track of their CUCs and the current exchange rate. I know scams happen, but at the cadecas and front desks who decides the exchange rate? And I thought at cadecas there is supposed to be a current chart of rates. A scam to me is when the teller is actually stealing without getting caught (tourist's problem); ripoffs are a different story but still the tourist's problem for not being alert. Carol is not a first timer; she knows what to do."
"sundog have you ever tried to debate the rate when you are fully aware of that day's rate at one of the cadecas? I have and the reply was ""that is what you get"" si Cuba!! I really miss the ways of the old Cuba. I know times are hard for the dear Cuban people but when we are generous with tipping and taking down gifts it irritates me that this should happen. Whatever!!"
"Hey BeachLover: I agree with you. I'm just saying that it is the tourist's fault if he/she is being BS'd. I don't bring down gifts but I do tip; just not to cadecas or front desk personnel. (Well some front desk staff!) . Canadians are very kind to ""the dear Cuban people"" and that is the problem. And it also irritates me that is what first timers think. We have trained them well. Most tourists run into resort employees without seeing the true Cuba. Not sure what percentage of Cubans work in resorts; but it has to be miniscule compared to the agricultural and interior villages, towns, etc. If someone in a cadeca says ""that is what you get"", I have the option of going to another cadeca (even better is going to the bank). Carol & I are frequent visitors and we know the score and how to evade the scams politely. I'm sure she handled it correctly. We can ask her when she is back!"
"HI SundOg,I understand everything you said.I have been going to Cuba and many other destinations since the 80's. The gifts I don't mean the dollarstore but there are many items which the Cuban people need that are essential to daily living which they can't obtain. The resort workers do well but I go to a village and help two farming families that do not work on resorts. I spend the day late into the night we have a pig roast and much communication in my broken Spanish. Maybe by telling this more visitors will help the people in the villages that do not work on the resorts. It is a wonderful experience the real Cuba. End of story. Be Happy!!"
"It is easy enough to keep track if you get a printed receipt, but if they refuse by telling you that you only get a printed receipt if you use your charge card then many people will fall for that. This happened to me at Playa Cayo coco and after arguing with a brick wall I finally whipped out my camera and told him I was going to record him and needed him to say that to me on camera..........well let me share that he freaked out of his mind, started to wave his hands and told me his computer was down and he would fix the problem in 10 min. More like he needed 10 min to drain the in ink out of the machine so I could hardly read the receipt and that was going to be his excuse, I did manage to see the amount and sure enough he originally had tried to short change me 5 CUC's. The lady behind me told me that she taught I was being really nasty but she watched her money and he had tried to rip her off 30 CUC's. I did tell the GM with his interpreter and he explained tome that they cannot control who comes in to the hotel and that it is separate, but he was going to report it. Yeah like whatever, my rose coloured glasses are so smashed up it is unreal, I see Cubans in a whole different light. More like steal your Mother from you and then try to give her back, while expecting a tip for it."
"SweetMystery, I have to say that that last statement is harsh. I have had many wonderful encounters in Cuba and will continue to go there as long as the experiences are good. Broad brush strokes are usually negative. There are bad apples in every barrel, but as far as I have experienced, the good ones by far outnumber the bad ones....everywhere in the world. I would continue to encourage anyone to visit Cuba and experience the warmth. Just use your street smarts - as you would anywhere in the world. My dos pesos..."
Sweetmystery is not beeing harsh its the reallity of people working with Money in Cadecas except the last time we were in Cuba every other time i have been to Varadero well these so wonderful people tried to rip me off from stores to restaurants and of course Cadecas as trust me i have no sympathy for these jer?? .Yes lots of great people in Cuba but those bad creeps way to many for my taste sure give the rest of them a bad name as the only place i can say i trust them are outside of the tourist areas and of course the Bank in Varadero .
"A Few Bad Apples ???? . The Freaking Apple Basket is Rotting Away , and more Every Day .,Sorry to Say ..The Scams and Ripoffs are everywhere .,Johnny C"
You know some folks save up a long time to go on a nice holiday . Don't read these forums . Trusting good people . Not veteran travelers They go to places with good hearts happy to be on a vacation and these scamming pukes rip them blindly . Don't know about you guys but it Pizzes me right off . Johnny C
I find it interesting that I have never been short changed and always get a receipt when I ask for one. Except once....at the corner Duty Free shop in Santa Clara. Cashier charged me for 4 bags and he only used one bag for the rum. I knew he was scamming me for a few pesos but saw that the situation was going to escalate so I let it go.
LMAO at this thread. So I guess you wont get ripped off at the airport and if you do it is your own fault for being so na√Øve and stupid as a tourist?
"good heavens! the rates in the resorts and commercial cadecas and airports are set by the international bank in Havana. I wasn't ripped off by anyone but the Cuban government. why they set different rates is a mystery to me. the best deals are still at the airports so use them and make sure the reps know where you are. you can go to the airport exchange at both arrivals and departures. sometimes the customs area, too. and yes, count your money, get a receipt. I always count my withdrawals at bank machines and at the tellers in Canada so why not everywhere else. in the tiendas, too.. I also check the Canadian rate online with the internet in cuba as well. carol e. and get online and complain to the ministry of tourism in Canada!!!!!"
"Received an e-mail from CC she asked me to let you all know to buy your pesos at the airport as the guests are being short changed at the cadecas and the resorts. Just passing it on. She is having a marvelous time at Mayanabo Annia is treating her like royalty so, so kind to her.Carol its your friend that was complaining about people getting short change because you are the one that told her so as im not going to blame the Cuban Gouvernment but the creeps that work in these places and keep on and on with there little scam games ..Only way to stop it well count your money in front of them and if you see money is missing well ask for the rest but problem is lots of Canadians either they don't know how to count or they just don't give a hoot and then complain when they get home which is the wrong way to go .."
We all were just commenting on the Ops comments Carol Johnny C
I appreciate your responses but I have received counterfeit money from Canadian major bank tellers and been short changed at the abms here. and I've never been stiffed at santa lucia by staff. carol e. come to think of it I've never been stiffed in cuba. guess I've been fortunate since 1988. and I do email the ministry regularly.Edited: 4 years ago 
"hola :) Cubacarol reply #14, yes the Cuban bank and government set the exchange rates, but it seems that the hotels and resorts are free to charge what ever service fee (%) as they want. It seems to be usually 5%. It is the one sitting behind the counter or the one managing the resort or hotel that (i think) is profiting from the extra fee. ps - there have been times that i wasn't charged that extra % and it was done with a smile :)"
