I am or was planing on arriving in San Pedro Sula in the next couple days and then taking either a private transfer or the Hedman Alas Bus to La Ceiba and then the ferry to the Bay Islands...But I am getting alot of info from people in San Pedro Sula that there are road blocks blocking the route...and that it is currently not possible to travel by road between San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba....Does anyone have any information on this???
The road blocks tend to last only for a few hours when they do happen. The police will allow the protestors to assemble and make their point... and then will try open a pass.Today the road was free from San Pedro Sula to El Progreso and onward to La Ceiba. On Monday the bridge between San Pedro Sula and El Progreso was blocked... but today there were no protests there.It is possible to travel.... however... you need to be flexible in planning for a delay....Today the road to Puerto Cortes was blocked in the morning but by mid-day the road cleared up....let me know if you have any questions....
is it safe to travel to honduras? any idea on how this impacts travel insurance? We are planning to arrive overground from guatemala to go to copan and dive in utila what would be the best way to do this to avoid the disturbances? thanks
Do you know if Headman Alas is still running it's daily routes between San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba?
"abax, read your trip insurance fine print very carefully. I noticed during the swine flu scare that most insurance policies did not cover epidemics. There may be an exclusion for ""general insurrection"" or ""acts of war,"" which of course is a stretch."

The clashes with police/army has happened only in Tegucigalpa at the Presidental palace.... everywhere else the protests are just people marching with signs. In San pedro Sula there was a small group of protestors that did throw rocks and stones at police but this happened downtown.Just be flexible on your travel plans and if the road is blocked... its typically a peaceful protest that last for a few hours. The blockades are happening at the toll booths so its generally happening right outside San Pedro Sula/Puerto Cortes...However... i will say that Thursday is going to be key about the developments in Honduras.Mel Zelaya advises that he will return to Honduras on thursday. ( he is coming with the President of Argentina & Ecuador).. but the new government is saying that if he arrives.. he will be arrested.Nobody knows what could happened...
Do you know if Headman Alas is still running it's daily routes between San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba?Yes---- the bus service is normal.. 
Did they lift the Curfew in San Pedro Sula Yet?
"Thanks, eholbik for your continued great information. We are going to Roatan in about 10 days and then likely flying from San Pedro to La Ceiba in Sept. If you can, please let us know from your perspective of any news re: Zelaya's arrival on Thurs. "
The curfew is still in effect from 10pm to 5am until friday. 
Is that 10 pm in San Pedro Sula? I read somewhere that it was earlier in San Pedro Sula than in other areas?
Sorry... there was confusion on the curfew time as the local media was reporting different information.Some said it started at 9pm others 10pm.The current time is 9pm to 5am. This is effective for 17 out of the 18 departmentos (states)Colon is the only departmento that has an earlier curfew of like 6 or 7pm.... not sure why....
"treisben22,Mel Zelaya has postponed his return until the weekend. The OAS is giving Honduras 72 hours to reinstate Zelaya or face suspension. Zelaya is set to come with OAS rep, the Argetina and Ecuador presidents.Honduras government is warning that Mel will be arrested if he arrives...."
"Just Received an email from Hedman Alas, which said they have stopped issuing tickets for the moment. But said that they hope to start issuing tickets again in the very near future. So sounds like they are not doing the trip until further notice. They also said that they hope to have the line back up and running within a day or two. But with this weekends events i'm guessing there won't be any new buses until next week..."
"islandhopper,I check with Hedman Alas and Viana bus lines. You are correct. Both did not operate and are still no operating.....Wow.. did not realize this... nice find...."
