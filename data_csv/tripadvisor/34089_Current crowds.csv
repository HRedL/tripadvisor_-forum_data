What are the current crowds looking like during the week? We have a reservation at Lodgepole midweek from Monday thru Friday. It’s right before Labor Day so we are leaving before the expected Holiday weekend crowd.
"Here is a brief update about Lodgepole-https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14305…Hopefully someone can comment about the crowds. It is very good that you are visiting mid-week. (If I were going, I would do the busiest trails first thing in the morning and during the day pick less popular trails or grab a good book and enjoy a quiet area- probably your campsite.)Lodgepole Campground"
"Thanks for being a burden to the entire State Los Angeles. We've lived your Memorial, 4th of July, and now Labor Day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spikes in our communties while the infectious disease doctors are still trying to figure it out. You go LA."
"I’m not exactly sure how social distanced camping in an rv mid week away from crowds brings you more harm than a trip to target with people refusing to wear masks but you go ahead and blame those of us who wear masks, stay outdoors, put bucket shield hats on our toddlers who sorry to break it to you need to see the sun and get fresh air.Edited: 4:37 pm, August 08, 2020 "
Thank you lemon curls
"We just spent two nights at Grant Grove and are now at Wuksachi. Crowds have been far less than I expected. We chose this week because NorCal school districts start school this week and so I was hoping for reduced crowds. The week before Labor Day every school should also be in session (even if it's virtual).We've never had to hunt for parking anywhere, although we do try to hit the highlights early. To repost what I posted on another thread: Having never been here before I can’t say if the Park is more or less crowded than normal. But we drove by Moro Rock around noon today after hiking Hanging Rock. While there were a dozen or so cars parallel parked on the side of the road, there were also five empty parking spots at Moro Rock itself. Then at General Sherman parking lot, the bottom tier of parking was full but the next tier was only half full at 1pm.Most trails we took we saw very few people, except for Sherman Tree Trail. There was a steady flow in both directions on Sherman, but fairly easy to maintain twenty feet of separation from the next group, except for a cluster around the tree itself.Moro Rock at 8:30am had only 4 cars in the lot when we arrived. Everyone was wearing masks and trying to step aside for social distancing when passing each other up and down, which is very difficult with how narrow Moro Rock is. Crescent Meadow/Tharp's Log we only passed 3 or 4 groups of people for the entire loop. Tunnel Log there were only two cars ahead of us waiting turns to take pictures. Hanging Rock we had all to ourselves. Beetle Rock there was one couple with two kids, but they left and we had the place to ourselves. Little Baldy Trail we passed maybe 5 or 6 groups in the entire 2-hour hike.In Kings Canyon it was similarly empty. I got to jump into the river off Muir Rock with only two other people around. Zumwalt Meadow we saw about 6 or 7 groups during the out-and-back (you can't complete the loop since the meadow part of it is closed). We had Grizzly Falls and Roaring River Falls all to ourselves at about 10am, although we could see Grizzly Falls was packed with people when we drove back out in the afternoon. Big Stump Trail saw only 2 other groups. Grant Tree Trail was probably the busiest, although we arrived at 5pm to a half-empty parking lot and it was far less crowded at that time than Sherman Tree Trail. In fact, we had planned to do Sherman Tree in the early evening to avoid the crowds, but decided to just pull up our masks and get it done earlier today.Overall, this trip has been far less crowded than our local trails in Orange County, and you should be even better off later in August."
"Thank you so much DrHickenlocher. It is so great to visit mid-week!In years past, the road out to Moro Rock has been shuttle only on the weekends, because of the crowds. Good to hear that it isn't too bad on the weekdays."
Thanks so much for the update. It sounds like you had a great time!
"Great update, DrH. This is so very helpful!My family is headed there next week from San Diego and I've been a bit nervous about the crowds. This makes me feel a lot better. We decided to travel later too because of school schedules."
We just got back from a midweek trip Tues-Sat and crowds were way lower than I expected. Never encountered a full parking lot and the earliest we were ever at a trailhead was by 9:45.
@mere- how was the smoke?
"It was fine while we were there but we left early Saturday morning and I'm so glad. By then and during our drive south through Central CA, it was very hazy and poor air quality according to the weather app. If I had a trip this week, I'd be cancelling."
