"Qantas has today joined Virgin and Jetstar in suspending all international flights from the end of March until at least end of May. If you are currently traveling in Australia, please organize to leave for home as soon as possible. If you are an Australian currently traveling overseas, please organize to cut your trip short and come home as soon as possible. Looks like the options for getting where you need to be are rapidly diminishing. https://www.executivetraveller.com/news/coro…"
There's a lot of freight moved around the world on passenger aircraft ... I wonder how this will affect that?
Well Luigi ... I read this with a cup of coffee straight outta my machine and had this scary thought about coffee bean supply drying up ... I was mortified at the prospect.
"Able 58, there have been problems with Air Freight for weeks. One of the Large manufactures wrote to it's clients last month and advise all orders after 1 March would have 3% surcharge. Air Freight prices have increased.I Consult to a Company that Air Lifts into Australia from China and Europe. All items are delayed. My understanding is Qantas do own Cargo Planes and also look at stripping out some out Passenger Craft for this purpose.People who run to buy Toilet Paper , and other things should focus on things that that are made off shore they require. For Qantas, they can make more money with freight than Economy Passengers.Good Luck"
"Unfortunately, every day is bringing bad news."
"LuigiDo you know the self life of Toothpaste.I am the Executer of an Estate and been cleaning up the House.I found a cupboard with 120 approx. , I stopped counting at 60 when I thought I was half way .Some of them dated back.

"Luigi, I certainly agree with your first two choices - coffee and chocolate."
"I get my coffee on a monthly subscription, I hope they don’t run out of stock any time soon! No one in my house would survive self isolation if I can’t have my coffee."
"Where is the Coffee Roasted ???I bought a extra KG of Lavazza when things started going Pear Shaped in Italy..So ,I have stock to get me through till Christmas. That said I could use some Toilet Paper !!!!Good Luck"
"Thanks Luigi , There are also some that are marked Net 110 g""Contents : Strontium chloride in a pleasantly flavoured cleansing dentifrice base"".There was also about 20 unopened bottles of Scotch , Plus some nice bottles of Red dating from the 1970's The wine was fine !!! The bottles of Vintage Port are even betterNo way I would trade coffee for Paper !!!There will be plenty of paper next week !!! But no coffee. Good LuckGood Luck"
"Forget the toothpaste, Chok Dee. Just use the scotch as mouthwash but DO NOT spit!Edited: 9:30 pm, March 18, 2020 "
