HiThis informative and interesting (IMO) article was published in The Times Of India today written by a well published photographer and author.…indiatimes.com/city/…24354864.cms
"Quite frightening bruahy, its five years since i was therebut even then you could see it was changing,then i heard the russians had found it and i reallyconsidered it doomed from then... i know theymostly spoiled turkey, or the resorts they flooded therebut Goa must understand that the same people who needed beds also have toilet needs, and if that infrastructure is not inplace then an epidemic is on the horizon... and it would only take one epidemic to wipe Goa off the tourist map, and thatwould be a terrible loss to all our friends, and how could the Goans deal with only indian visitors?"
Quite a depressing article.
"yes rhino but its still basically conjecturethere is still time to repair the placebut they have to spend some of the millionson the infrastructure, instead of creaming itof into back pockets...how hard is it to collect the rubbish? thereare still plenty goans looking for workheck they even have to bus the beggars infrom Gudgerat..."
"Yep, I found it interesting Bruahy. I been there 13-14 times or so (lost count) over the last 18 years or so and have seen great changes, mostly for the worse. However, this is what seems to happen all over the world when a particular place becomes popular, seems to be inevitable.I must say that my own opinion is that the powers that be, should take the problem in hand and make the changes that need to be made, the growth should be managed in a proper way.I do realise that some people want different things from a holiday, like night clubs, noisy bars and loud entertainment etc, (i'm not one of those) but that sort of thing is ruining what people like me go Goa for, thank goodness for south Goa, but I fear that will go the same way eventually.Readers, please accept that is my own personal opinion.BOB...."
"I certainly except what you say Bob , Myself I like a place where you can have a quiet day or a jumping evening, we are all different. My gripe with Goa is the rubbish, It has increased so much. i hate to say it but quite a lot of that is caused by indian tourists who's culture is to throw it down where they stand. throwing bottles into the sea as sport , never stopping to think of the problems it can cause Of course that is not all the problem , corruption means nothing is done properly. Will they sort it out?? No IMO.In some ways i am glad i am old and will not see a place i have loved since 1986 further spoiled. It is such a shame."
"And yet when they tried to stop the encroachment of sunbeds right up to the sea edge, everyone was up in arms............it makes you think."
"I think that is not quite what happened Phil. Most people where in favor of some regulation , but thought 5 beds was taking it a step to far , Its about 20 this year and they must be near the shack ( I think) which most people will think fair . there is a middle between two ends. No one wants to sit on the beach as it is none to clean with lots of broken glass.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I was one of the complainers Vurda, sending e-mails to the authorities etc.But on reflection, it was getting out of hand with beds right up to the seas edge in places, so the tourist must take some of the blame.But i will be in Candolim soon and hope the beach at the Sinquerim end is as good as what a friend from the Santana txt me last week, saying how much the beach has improved since the upper part of our friend the River P as gone."
The beach looked much better this year with all the beds kept further back. 20 beds is enough for each shack.This was a great improvement I thought but I must agree about the amount of rubbish as it is becoming disgracefull.Although I had another great time there as usual i do feel that tourism is being took for granted. Giving it a miss this next year as we are off back to Vietnam and taking in Cambodia along the way. I sincerely hope that Goa gets it act together and starts thinking a bit more about its tourists but sadly I don't think that this will happen and things will only become even worse.
Its what those of us who have been going for years have been saying for years.Nobody who hasnt got rose tinted glasses on can see any prospect of real change while the deeply embedded corruption is allowed to continue.
