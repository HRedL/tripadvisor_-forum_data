Hi just wondering if any1 ellse has decided not to have the yellow fever injection. Like ourselves!! had everything thing ellse and bought malarone!! just wondering thanks!! As we have decided aganist it!!
HelloIt might be worth looking at the previous forum on this.Scroll down or type in Yellow Fever: Yes or No? in the search box.Also there should be other comments if you just type in Yellow Fever.Best wishes
We were told by doctors that they may not let us in country if we did not have the jab as they sometimes want to see the recoded of you having it done! We then looked into yellow fever and decided that it really is not something that we wanted to get so parted with our £90 for the jags!
"Hi,ive been thru immigration/border control in kenya approx 50 times and never been asked if i have yellow fever jab. They wont ask you.Edited: 10 years ago "
None of the injections are mandatory when going to Kenya. You may be asked for a yellow fever certificate IF you are coming from an epidemic country. I have never been asked to show any certificates. Danielle
"Hi there, I am going out for the 1st time with my 15 yr old son in Oct, and we are not going to be having the YF jabs, we have done research on here the fors and againsts and the if u have to or not, it seems clear to me that it is only if you are coming from an infected country that u need it and obviuosly the UK is not so we will not be having it, i wish u well in ur decision making, and have a great holiday, i,m sure it will all be worth it.Lizdrip69"
"hi keegan as mallamombasa said you do not need YF INJECTION. if you are going on to another country yes but we have been 14 times and have never been asked for it. so don,t spend your money and have a great time in kenya"
"Hi, been going to kenya now for 12 years and had the YF jab the first time cos I thought I had to have it. You dont! and yes I am going May 10th and staying at Travellers Club. Where are you staying.?"
"People like you confuse the hell out of me, why wouldnt you have the yellow fever jab? You spend a fortune on malarone of which everyone that I have met in person have had a bad stomach with as opposed to a very very cheap alternative of Doxycycline of who everyone that I have personally met have no problem with, yet you wont protect yourself for ten years with something that is advised? Spend a fair sum on a holiday, fortune on malaria tablets and then try and justify not having yellow fever jab, Im sure you have some logic behind it somewhere!!!!Edited: 10 years ago "
"welshie i think you find that YF jab is only neccessary if you are comming from or going to a country that has YF. some doctors say yes others say no. there are posters on here who spend upto 3 months at a time in kenya and have never had the jab. we went to kenya for the first time in 1991 and did have the jab, but have been back to our doc for boosters for other jabs and he said we did not need it. i would say, if you feel you want it, have it"
for got to add we take doxycyline

"Thankyou to you all for replys!! The reason we are not having this injection is because of the side affects, you can actually die from a brain seizsure after 28 days after taking injection!! its nothing at all to do with the money!! even tough it is expensive!!! its the side affects that worried me, so we not having it! thanks for replys."
"Keegan - you sound as if you have made an informed decision. As frequent travellers have said, we have NEVER been asked for any health documents when coming from directly UK. My only times have been when using Ethiopian Airlines and therefore having a transit stop in Africa."
"hi keegan just one other thing, a lot of people seem to have bad side affects with malarone. i know one year we tryed them instead of our normal doxycyline and the wife was really bad, i was ok."
Doxy is MUCH cheaper as well!
"Hi, was just wondering about ur comment on the yellow fever jab and the side effects of havin a brain seizure!?! We have been debatin whether or not to get it but had not heard of this. Where did you find this out and are there any other side effects?"
"Hi,severe reactions are extremely rare and more likely in the elderly, everything you could want to know here in this National Travel Health Network and Centre fact sheetwww.nathnac.org/travel/factsheets/YF.htm"
"hi it was the nurse who told me about it! after injection you get flu like symptoms, there are quite a few side affects. so where not having this injection. We have had the rest of them!! we go kenya next week!! so excited!"

"Hi I've just been to the nurse going to diani in June for 2 weeks, was told if going to mombassa and back do not need yellow fever which please about as often occur side effects!! BUt have been prescribed malorone.... now a bit worried have not heard of the other one you are talking about thats much cheaper too with less side effects, help how do I get those???"
doxycyline?? also nothing was mentioned to me about swine flu this was a good few weeks ago.... do you think I need to go back??Any info much appreciatedDawna
"hi dawna yes we always use doxycycline, apart from being cheaper they dont seem to have any side affects. one year we did take malarone which really made thewife ill[bad dreams/skin rash. ] i was ok. and whats all this about swine flu. one of the posters on here lives out 6months a year, and he never mentions it you will still need a doctors perscription."
"There is a lot of talk about malarone vs doxycycline on other threads. can you find them? (I don't have time.)Briefly, I have been advised by an expat doctor living in Kenya (as I do) that if doxy is taken in the evening, with the evening meal, it is most effective when it is most needed. A side effect is sun sensitivity in some people, but the Doctor concerned is very fair skinned and their whole family takes it. They say that when you are exposed to the sun the next day, the problem is minimal.We buy it in Kenya and it costs 3/- to 5/- per capsule. Get from a reputable chemist. However, you need to start taking it before you leave UK, so you'll have to pay more to get it in UK. Whatever, it is much cheaper than Malarone."
"The reason more people take Malerone, is that you only need to take it for 7 days after leaving the the risk area, whereas you need to continue to take doxy for 28 days, so Malerone is more convenient.I used Malerone on several trips with no side effects, the majority oif people do not suffer side effects, but some people get upset stomachs or headaches.Side effects for doxy are very rare and as said can mean increased sensitivity to the sun, I am fair skinned and have used doxy on two 3 month visits with no effect (but I am not a sunbather). There is a risk of heartburn but taking the tablet with a meal or with dairy products eliminates this. As doxy is a broad spectrum anti-biotic it might increase the risk of thrush in women. However it has the bonus that it is also prescribed for treating gastric illnesses.Discuss what best suits you with your nurse"
"Thanks for that info think I'm going to stick with malorone as thats the prescription I have currently and sounds like there re side effects from both anyway.......so going to take the gamble.......also its a pain keep going to the nurse.Regards to swine flu jab again not going back to nurse now just going to take the risk, I'm sure she would have mentioned it if its a concern...... thanks again hope you all have a good trip!Dawna"
"I say have the injection, we have done a lot of research on this and it points to having the injection. Insurance companies could hold it against you if you get ill over there. This vaccine is recommended - can't put a price on health. I just got mine this afternoon, going in May too."
I have been to a yellow fever clinic today and been told there is a very very low risk of getting yellow fever and not to have the injection. Nobody has had it since 1998 in kenya that is 12 years ago i think there are alot of people being misled. The nurse we saw was born and raised in kenya she goes back regular and does not have it. Therefore we are not having it.
"mayer14Thanks for passing that on. It's good when health professionals are using their own experience and knowledge and not just reading from the manual and recommending very expensive, unnecessary jabs. There's actually a host of jabs you *could* have before going to Kenya – plague anyone? rabies? typhoid? meningitis? . . . Richard"
