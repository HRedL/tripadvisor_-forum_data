"I recently posted and said that cholera was serious only in easternmost Cuba. I was wrong. According to both the Miami Herald and the BBC, there have since been dozens of cases in Havana proper.Please note that cholera is not an airborne disease. You can get it from water, food, and possibly from human contact. When I say it'd not airborne, that doesn't mean you couldn't get it if someone coughs or sneezes close to your face.Drink only bottled drinks or water that has been subjected to a rolling boil for at least 10 minutes. Avoid ice, and be very careful with salads and food that has not been peeled first and/or thoroughly cooked. Wash your hands frequently, and use soap (good advice nomatter where you are)Most foreign visitors to Cuba are required to purchase health insurance for the duration of their visit. Sometimes, its included with your package, and sometimes you have to buy it on arrival (ours cost about $25 each in 2011) If you do get sick, get help right away. Cuba has its problems, to be sure, but one thing they do have is good medical care."
Dozens of cases in a population of 3 million.
oh dear :-s going there on 1 February. should I go ahead by all means? Will be staying in Havana's Presidente hotel.
Tobias S:I wouldn't be changing my plans if i were going. Just take the normal precautions.
"I'm going next week... no worries from my side. Below is quote from UK FCO:On 15 January 2013, the Cuban authorities reported 51 confirmed cases of cholera in Havana. This follows their report of an earlier outbreak which started in the east of Cuba from June to August 2012. You are strongly advised to monitor local reporting, take sensible precautions regarding water, food and personal hygiene and seek immediate medical attention if you suffer from diarrhoea. For further information visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website. See Health."
How do I know the diarrhoea is not from eating something quite out of the ordinary? This is a very nasty story to read I admit. I thought Cholera was a disease from the Dark Ages.Edited: 7 years ago 
"Tobias:If you are that worried about it, go out and buy some dukarol, but personally I think you are worrying far too much about it."
"I think the best, most rational thing to do is following the situation closely and understand that 56 people have been affected in a population of over a million. As such, no reason to worry (yet).And thank you for that medicine tip."
"A population of some 3 million.If you are planning to stay in a shack with no running water, eat the dodgiest of street food, drink whatever water you can find - then worry.Otherwise, wash your hands before meals and after visiting the bathroom. Drink bottled or boiled water. Don't worry."
"Just take appropriate precautions as noted by myself and Gordon, and go! Havana is a wonderful city and shouldn't be missed. I made this post simply because a day or two earlier, not knowing the facts, I had posted that cholera had been reported only in the easternmost provinces."
"Don't be scared, if you live in Brussels and eat at the turkish you have more chance for a diarreah than from a cuban meal ;) drink a lot of fresh juices, be healthy and prepare your immune system, there shall be no problems!Edited: 7 years ago "
"thanks jucamadaas :) seems like we will be in Havana around the same time.Latest reports (and there aren't many, so it's promising) suggest that the outbreak has been contained."
"www.cubaabsolutely.com/Havana_Guide/top50.phpHello Tobias, we are also going to Havana early feb - here is a link I got from this forum that shows all the highly recommended places to eat - we are going to make a list to take with us so hopefully that should stand us in good stead, having said that we are staying in some casa's that have numerous fantastic reviews for their homecooking too. I shall also stock up on my hand gel. I din't know if it is very snowy where you are but is here in eastern Uk right now so I think I will appreciate the exotic, warm atmosphere of Havana no end when we get there ;-)"
"yeah, it's cold, frigid, foggy and snowy where I live. Havana will be like a dream! Thanks for the link. Hope the restaurants are a bit single-friendly, given of course they lose out (at least one place will not be filled at the table).Just for info Jools, how are you flying? I'm going from Brussels direct Varadero. According to my flight ticket it will take some 11 hours and 15 minutes to reach the destination (non-stop). It will be grueling that chapter. I say this for laughing, but with a tone of worry too: I will probably get so bored that I will want to jump from the plane, lol."
"What are they flying DC-3? It's 9,5-10 hours from just about anywhere else in central Europe."
"Guys just came back, it is very serious, pack Immodium, Hand Sanitizer, only eat in places noted here or in travel guides - don't let anyone open the bottle of water, you open it! Be very careful, if you get sick remember to replace fluids drink water, follow the BRAT (Banana Rice Apple Sauce Toast) method bring gatorade (powdered solution to replace electrolytes , don't drink soda, you need a proper balance of Potassium and Sodium, Immodium! Use only bottled water!Fluids are lost rapidily with Cholera, 1Gal painless w/ Gas stools that smell like fish are reported, replace water immediately!Edited: 7 years ago "
Hi TobiasWe are flying from London Gatwick direct to Havana Airport (Josef Marti) with a flying time of 9hrs 55. I have done 11.5 hours to Thailand before so i know your pain but I find the first 6 hours go pretty quick and it is after that I start to get restless :-)Hi DannyIt sounds as though they are putting a lot of effort in over there to keep the cholera contained to the one area though?
"Cuba is very aggressive at dealing with and containing epidemics. My daughter and I were there in August 2006 during a dengue fever epidemic. There were giant spray trucks all over Havana, a spray plane flying over every day, and warnings posted about the mosquitos spreading it in cafes."
"Cuba has poor water and septic management systems they are long overdue for an upgrade, if they don't solve this issue in the coming decade these bursts are going to get worse.Think about it the spoon, lettuce, produce, plate, toothbrush you wash could get infected, it can live and grow in any environment,"
There's no point trying to scare everyone about it who is still waiting to go! You didn't get it as hasn't any tourist yet! I've been to India - nothing can beat india for dire hygiene standards!!!
So far there has been no indication of any contamination by cholera of any water supply in Havana.
I must say the story of Danny H upsets me a lot. As a very 'thin traveler' I cannot afford to loose much more kgs. Why is it that I see no sites reporting the Cholera anymore? I really thought it was contained now.
"I'm not trying to scare anyone, just play it safe and smart - i don't ever wish anyone's vacation be ruined for something that could've been prevented. Don't drink tap water, be cautious were you eat, wash your hands constantly!https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&q=cholera+cuba&oq=cholera+cuba&gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i400.1737.3965.0.4245.12.4.0.8.8.0.125.292.3j1.4.0...0.0...1ac.1.TC8nfKpQt-wthe gov't did a good job on educating people on sanitary topics, washing hands, spritz hands with chlorinego to cuba have FUN!"
"that doesn't mean you couldn't get it if someone coughs or sneezes close to your face.================================================Maybe you are thinking of Tuberculosis, which is spread through infected droplets from coughing and sneezing,while Cholera is spread through contaminated water and food, and is more common during floods and rainy seasons."
"@Jools: day flight? Mine is leaving at 7.25 AM, arriving around noon Havana time. That is quite positive. Although I will have to get up ridiculously early (expected check-in at 4.30 AM), I should have at least some time to relax, stretch the legs a bit and enjoy a mojito at the poolside of my hotel.Return flight will take place during the night. Not a big fan of those, but oh well.Will try to have fun and not think of this cholera stuff. It is safe to shower, yes? @ Danny: we won't have 'Gatorade' where I live, so could you possibly state the European alternative? Also, never heard of the BRAT. I presume it is some sort of diet?"
"In the UK millions of people get norovirus every nov/dec but it doesn't seem to stop anybody coming here or going about normal business. With such high figures here for norovirus, 51 or even a few more than that in the whole of Havana with cholera still seems a very tiny number.Danny, you have to becareful how your posts read - imagine how you would have felt before you went if someone had come on here stating ""I just got back and it's very serious!!!!"" ""you may catch from your spoon, toothbrush and anything you eat or drink""The Cubans will be unhappy and doing everything possible to eradicate it again as bizarrely it was UN workers from Nepal that introduced it to Cuba!"
"Tobias - he gave the meaning of BRAT - banana, rice, apple sauce, toast.Gatorade is a high sugar fizzy drink."
"@TobiasOur flight leaves Gatwick at 11.35am arriving in Havana 4.30pm their time. The flight back leaves about 7.30 in the evening to get back to Gatwick at 9.10 in the morning - I hate the overnight flights, I can never sleep and the one time I took a sleeping pill, I was sat in the aisle seat and the couple in the seats next to me kept waking me up to let them get up and go for a wander - they did time and time again!!!! I always think to myself that I can't face anymore long haul but I am always lying to myself and it is always worth it :-)I can't believe I am just over a week away from the Malecon and beautiful architecture - not to mention a few days relaxing on Guanabo Beach."
"@ TobiasI think it will be safe to shower so long as you don't get too much water in your mouth , I survived a fortnight showering in India and they have no water treatment whatsoever! I have just been doing a little read and they do have water service companies but they sometimes have trouble with availability of chlorine to put in it."
"Gatorade is not fizzy...It is a sport drink (at least that's how its marketed) to combat dehydration. It replaces electrolytes your body looses when you sweat. They also contain potassium and other things...you can buy powdered mixes at Acklands Grainger and other safety stores, possibly even amazon. I think I've even seen it at my grocery store.Cheers"
European equivilant of Gatograde (which you can buy in EU) is Isostar powder or similar. If you want it ready made... Aquarius is the same.About showering.... just smell for 2 weeks or go for a dip in the sea (or maybe not... you might catch something dodgy:) )
"Jools1979, I believe you have your facts wrong, it is believed that it was a worker from Nepal that introduced it to Haiti, not Cuba."
Link below gives you latest info from UK FCO sources:www.nathnac.org/DiseaseReport.aspx…
"""it is believed that it was a worker from Nepal that introduced it to Haiti,""True enough, but then Cuban aid workers appear to have brought it back with them from Haiti to Cuba. At least, that is the theory, and it seems sound, since Cuba had had no cases for many years and the first cases that appeared did so in the area and around the time of the return of medical personal from Haiti."
"@ Eltor, I hate people who have to be arrogant on forums - I am saying the Cholera currently in Cuba didn't come from Cuba which is actually correct! Life is too short to be as pedantic as people like youEdited: 7 years ago "
You are certainly safer showering than you would be swimming in the seas near Havana !Just don't open you mouth - so no singing !Edited: 7 years ago 
The name of the medicin is DUKORAL and not Dukarol
