"Hi there!My fiance and I are planning a trip up to Scotland (from England) for the end of July to celebrate our anniversary. We were supposed to be getting married in September, but it's been postponed til 2021, so one more year of the old anniversary date it seems! We both had COVID at the beginning of March, and thus can't give or get the virus again, so we feel comfortable traveling now that things are opening back up. We're hoping to do a couple nights in Glencoe and then 4-5 nights in Skye. Flight options appear to be Glasgow or Inverness. We're hoping to do the scenic train from Glasgow to Maillag one of the directions, rent a car at some point, and drive the other way (it's flexible and a bit complicated it seems). So, I have two main questions:1. How to combine the scenic train with ferry/car situation. I know there is a ferry from Mallaig but then I can't figure out where you end up. How do you get to Portree or wherever you need to rent a car from? Are there rentals in that town or in Malliag? I'm reading that the ferry isn't going to be 100% operational, so I'm guessing that meas we should drive over the bridge to get to Skye? If that's the case, would I be able to get a car in Mallaig or I should I just abandon that leg of the train and rent a car in Ft William?2. Where to stay in Skye. We're lucky in a strange way in that since everything has been closed, there are so many wonderful places available to choose from. We're looking at airbnbs/self catering options, and would ideally like something scenic and removed. Are there areas that are worth investigating more than others, or areas we definitely shouldn't stay? Any help is appreciated. Best,Kelly"
"What do you mean you can't get covid again ??? There have been cases where people have had it twice and the experts are still working out what it does ! Don't think you're immune.https:/…Edited to include link. Bottom line, they don't know.Edited: 12:39 pm, June 25, 2020 "
“and drive the other way (it's flexible and a bit complicated it seems). “Yes it’s complicated as there are- AFAIK - no one way rentals between Glasgow and Skye as there no companies with a depot at both ends.
"Dealing with the Car!In that part of the World (Ft William, Mallaig or Skye itself) there are only very small independent Hire companies, therefore one way Hire (i.e. dropping the car elsewhere) is virtually near impossible, or extremely expensive as the the company needs to send someone down to say Glasgow to recover the car!So that’s you biggest obstacle if you are hoping to train it one way and drive back the other way.A car on Skye is virtually essential!Re your claim regarding Covid, it was in the news today that Antibody Tests are in no way conclusive, basically even the Scientific evidence that you are immune or cannot pass it on is inconclusive!"
"I was simplifying for the sake of conciseness. Nothing about this situation is clear. However, the overwhelming assumption by the community is that it's highly unlikely you can get it more than once. We are still very cautious (wear masks, keep socially distant). I was simply intending to point out that I don't believe we are a threat to this area (in line with governmental advise). But thanks for your link/input! :)"
"Very good to know! Thank you! I found a one way from Ft. William, but I hadn't fully investigated Skye. Definitely will be something to keep in mind! Appreciate your input!"
"We have not had the antibodies tests, but rather had the actual test when we were actually sick back then. I do not mean to imply it is conclusive, simply that we are certainly a lower risk factor than most. You can get chickenpox twice but it's still quite unlikely. :) It's not particularly relevant to my questions. Appreciate the feedback about the car. I think my train dreams might have to wait for another trip. :)"
"I wasn’t berating you over your assumption, if I were to have had it, I would probably assume the same, just highlighting the fact that the science behind this Virus is still being understood.Re the train and car.It is possible to hire in Glasgow and drop in Inverness, or vice versa, there are bigger Companies in both to facilitate one way Hire.So you could hire in Glasgow, drive to Ft William, take the Jacobite from Ft William to Mallaig and Return, or even the cheaper ScotRail Service, it’s the same track and scenery.Then from Ft William drive to Skye over the Bridge, the Ferry might still be restricted, then after your stay on Skye drive to Inverness and drop the car.All this could be easily done in reverse of course!Edited: 1:00 pm, June 25, 2020 "
There are local hirers on Skye who will meet you off the ferry at Armadale and IIRC will let drop at Kyle for the train.
"Here in Wales we are being urged not to use public transport if at all possible. I don't know if that's the case in Scotland as well, or when things will change if it is. It's just something else to think about in the new normal."
"I consider that those of us who have had this virus are just as much risk to others as most people. Primary transmission is by touching surfaces, we can still touch an infected surface and pass it on to many other surfaces. In some ways it’s more difficult as we constantly have to put the health of others first and don’t have the additional prompt of fear for ourselves. Take care, please."
"Brian, Morar Motors (M2) are the outfit on Skye who will let you pick up at Armadale Ferry Slip and let you drop off at Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland just over the Skye Bridge, or vice versa!That might be an option for the OP.So a flight to Inverness, train from Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh, pick up Car, Tour Skye (3 days Minimum recommended), Drop the Car at Armadale, Ferry to Mallaig, Train to Glasgow via Ft William!Or vice versa!"
"Is the train in itself important between FW and Mallaig? It's a great journey but you will IMO (ok, not being a train buff either) get more out of exploring its finest corners if you go by car.Enjoy the scenery at Glenfinnan (and perhaps watch for the Jaobite going over the viaduct).Stop off at Loch nam Uamh, beautiful, the Camusdarach beaches (made famous in the film 'Local Hero'), stroll the lovely Silver Sands of Morar, drive the 2/3 short miles to Loch Morar, a beautiful, peaceful spot.Skye definitely needs a car! If you do go via the Mallaig ferry to Skye, then watch the weather forecast - if there's one ferry that will be cancelled for weather or 'technical reasons' it's that one:("
"'I consider that those of us who have had this virus are just as much risk to others as most people.' Based on what evidence, please. 'Primary transmission is by touching surfaces' It isn't. Transmission is via droplets - different from aerosolised or airborne transmission - in most cases. Aerosolised transmission is less likely which is why distancing is recommended as droplets are relatively heavy and will fall or not travel far.'we can still touch an infected surface and pass it on to many other surfaces.' If one has a viral load, coughs into a hand and then touches a surface it is possible for the virus to be transferred to that surface. Another person would have to touch that surface then touch their eyes, nose or mouth to risk transmission.In terms of antibody or immunoglobulin coverage after recovery from the illness, it's too soon to determine how long that lasts as we're just seven months into dealing with the matter. Reports of those who have recoverd continuing to shed virus particles or virus aren't definitive on whether the virus shed is active or deceased.With all that, physical distancing and hand hygiene should remain first line activities for those travelling. I'd want a car when travelling to Skye, and would (if possible) take the train to Glasgow and hire a car from the airport to and from the countryside."
"With so many nights on Skye, consider spending at least one of them in Elgol. Not only is it scenic and removed, but it also facilitates an early morning boat trip to Loch Coruisk for one of the most spectacular hikes in Scotland, through the Cuillin hills. We stayed in one of the Steading suites in Coruisk House, a beautiful 100 year old inn. There is no self-catering, but the restaurant there is fantastic, using fresh local ingredients. One of the highlights of our trip . https://coruiskhouse.com/"
"I would second Elgol and the boat trip to Coruisk.Avoid Portree or Broadford if you want 'removed.'The Waternish peninsula gives spectacular views/sunsets.As do various places on the North Trottenish Coast around and beyond Staffin.Sleat, the very south end of Skye, has some tremendous views and feels off the beaten track...Ord, Tarskavaig...Ardvasar...far less visited than many other areas."
"Forget worrying about car hire or trains.You are scheduling this for only a week or two after the Tourist Industry gets the green light.Your biggest concern is accommodation, self catering establishments (rentals) are getting the go ahead sooner, Hotels and B&B’s might not be up to speed, couple that with a record Staycation boom for the foreseeable future, everyone else is itching to get some sort of holiday!Have you checked Flights? Edinburgh and Glasgow are handling around just 200 passengers a day, god knows if Inverness is handling anything?"
I too would rent in either Glasgow or Inverness and enjoy the drive to Skye.www.arnoldclarkrental.com
"Thanks so much for this info! I do enjoy driving, and am not particularly a train person per say. I think I just always fantasized about that scenic train. It's quite famous in the US, and there's a very romantic notion about it that's likely no true lol. Also, my partner doesn't drive, so any break I can get it sometimes appreciated! :) But I think driving is looking like our best bet. And thank you so much for the recommendations about location! Super helpful!"
Thank you for posting all of this as a reply so I didn't have to. :) Really appreciate it! And agree-- our first line defenses are what we have to keep doing regardless :)We're definitely having a car on Skye-- more of a question of getting it in Skye or on the mainland. Looking like mainland is the way to go! :)
"Your assumptions that I have done absolutely no research into this is staggering, and quite insulting. Of course I've looked into flights. There are flights to all major cities in Scotland daily from multiple London airports. Certainly fewer than normal, but you just need to plan for that and book accordingly. Also, as I mentioned in my actual post, there are a plethora of AirBnB's available all of whom are eager to have guests again so that they can maintain their businesses. Thank you for your concerns, but please do not act as though I have never traveled before. It's very insulting."
Oh this sounds lovely! Thank you so much! We will definitely check it out.
"If you fancy the train journey then you can park the car in Ft William and do a return trip to Mallaig and back.As hotels and restaurants are only able to open from the 15th July you might have to be flexible if you want to eat out.No problem getting food for an AirbnB obviously.EDIT - If you are replying to a specific post it helps to identify that, as the TA reply system doesn't function the way you might expect and just adds to the thread.Edited: 6:06 am, June 26, 2020 "
"Fort William - Mallaig railway is currently blocked by a landslide. No idea how long it will take to clear, last one nearby was a week of closure but who knows with Network Rail."
"Kelly, your post at 20 seems to be aimed at mine at 16.I find that astounding, in all the replies I have gave to you I have been helpful and offered nothing but great advice.If that’s the case, then I’m afraid you won’t be getting any further advice!"
"There may be a plethora of Airbnb advertising, but will they be enforcing the cleaning regime which is supposed to be implemented between occupancies?"
"I have to say, if you haven't already booked accommodation, best get something sorted. The Scottish schools are planning to go back on August 11th so everyone who isn't going abroad will be taking their holidays at home from 3rd July to 10th August!And yes, I agree with the previous post. Hopefully ALL accommodation providers will b up to speed on deep cleaning procedures.Edited: 9:38 am, June 26, 2020 "
"Thanks everyone for the advice/input. We have rented a lovely cottage in Culnacnock for 4 nights. We're going to rent a car either at the airport city or Ft. William (we're staying there at Ardrhu house for 2 nights; sorting out the car now), and drive on, off, and around Skye. We're planning to drive down one of the days to Elgor to do the boat and hike across to Loch Coruisk. The boating agencies are super helpful and taking reservations with the understanding that things might be changing and times need to be flexible, which we're fine with! Fingers crossed we get a chance to do that. Any other *must do* in Skye would of course be welcomed. Thanks again everyone! Oh, and yes, things do appear to be booking *very* quickly. Lots of people eager to get back out and about. :)"
"'Oh, and yes, things do appear to be booking *very* quickly. Lots of people eager to get back out and about. :)'Indeed! Sorting out our own trip up north right now including Skye(family home so no accommodation problems) - can't wait!Skye - so much to see....I'll post the link to what I would do with 2/3 days - it includes the Elgol trip which we have done a few times now and will do again. Magnificent part of Skye , including into Loch Coruisk and Loch Scavaig.https://wp.me/p4QqFa-2qI"
A short drive from Culnacnoc you might like to dine at Columba 1400 in Staffin.
"I think your original questions have been covered.I'm sure you will be aware of the different pace of easing the lockdown in England and Scotland however just in case I attach a link to the Scottish Government's most recent announcement. It may be of interest to others also planning travel at this early stage. ""Confirmation is subject to relevant evidence reviews and phase criteria being met"" - mainly that there is no significant increase in the spread of Covid-19.The concern may not be whether you are at risk of catching/spreading the Covid-19 virus again (immunity being still unproven) but that the Scottish Government may not implement the indicative plans at the review dates. Another factor which may come into play is the ""fear"" that some locals will possibly have of visitors and the consequent welcome, or lack of it. that may be extended at present. The bridge to Skye has always been an option, unlike many other islands, however a (theoretical) 5 mile travel restriction policy to date has meant that visitors have possibly been few and far between. Contributors from the island will know the actual situation better than non-residents. Perhaps by the end of July it will be ""business as usual"" - time will tell. https:/…"
"As a virologist advising the Scottish gov on Covid epidemiology I can tell you that static antibody protection may only last a matter of weeks, dependant on severity of infection (IE mild case = weeks). Also it is proven that, esp mild cases, can have virus remain dormant, be asymptomatic, but still be shedding enough to be contageous up to 6 months after you yourself contracted it. Skye's health system is fragile at best of times & we have already had v bad outbreak in a care home. Please be a responsible Sassenach and stay away until we have a vaccine or better theraputics"
"I think I need to know your name before I can be convinced, and also some sort of link to the research you are citing. If you are saying that you can get the virus more than once, how do they know that the virus can remain dormant in a mild case for six months? Couldn't the person have simply caught it a second time? And don't these people need to live in China if they have tested positive six months ago.As a virologist working in Portree, is your advice limited to Skye, or do you disapprove of the easing in lockdown generally? And you might like to brush up on the spelling of ""contagious"" and ""therapeutics""."
"'I can tell you that static antibody protection may only last a matter of weeks, dependant on severity of infection (IE mild case = weeks).' Is that right.'Also it is proven that, esp mild cases, can have virus remain dormant, be asymptomatic, but still be shedding enough to be contageous [sic] up to 6 months after you yourself contracted it.' Hmm.The data indicates the first case was reported in Wuhan on 17 November 2019. That gives a not quite seven month history of the virus and its effects during and after illness, and as such antibody or immune-modulated protection in the long term can't be measured yet.As for being 'contageous' up to six months after having come in contact with the virus and become ill, that measurement of six months seems odd with the seven month time frame we have. A very quick search at PubMed and elsewhere gives this https:/… and this https:/…Coronavirus_COVID_19__SARS_CoV_2_"
"The science looks a bit iffy to me, and the lack of any links to the source of the information even more so.Unless more information is provided, I'm going to regard post 31 very sceptically indeed."
I'd say that post comes under the heading Posting on the Internet Scottish Hogwash.I'll leave you to work out the acronym. ;)
"I am not about to debate the merits of scientific research here I fear, this is hardly The Lancet in terms of a peer-reviewed forum! Suffice to say it would be inaccurate to describe the risk of increased Covid transmission in such scenarios as nil, or even negligible. Just because something legally is permissible does not abrogate personal responsibility. Deluging remote rural communities such as Skye, or the Highlands more generically, at this delicate moment in the epidemiological progression risks increased spread & the overwhelming of, already limited, healthcare resource, ergo: common sense. Oh, many thanks for correcting the spelling by the way (auto-spell check I am afraid): such grace and curtesy (!)."
"'such grace and curtesy (!)' Auto-correct again?'I am not about to debate the merits of scientific research here I fear, this is hardly The Lancet in terms of a peer-reviewed forum!' One can't discuss or debate when facts haven't been produced, qv post 31.What's not at issue is that people need to be circumspect at this time whether travelling by rail, air or private car and whether in cities or rural areas."
">>>Just because something legally is permissible does not abrogate personal responsibility.<<<I do agree with this, even though I disagree with posting ""facts"" without any supporting evidence."
"The message being repeated by the Scottish Govt is to travel responsibly, taking the necessary precautions as advised (face masks mandatory in shops from end of next week for example), washing hands/surfaces....etc etc.I was listening yesterday (while on Skye) to the BBC's Highlands and Islands radio news report and they interviewed the lady who is head of Skye and Kyle/Lochalsh's Tourism Association. I think that was her title anyway. On behalf of Association members, she expressed nothing but delight at the opening up of tourism again both on 3 July (self catering places/the 5 mile travel for leisure restraint lifted ) and July 15th when all accommodation may open if they are ready to do so, plus restaurants etc. She did make the point that Skye's economy relies very much on tourism these days, (whether people like that or not!)Edited: 2:58 pm, July 03, 2020 "
"#36 Spelling in itself may be unimportant, but getting it wrong for words that should be second nature to a virologist destroys your limited credibility.When I type ""contageous"" and ""theraputics"" into this reply both of them come out underlined in a wavy red line. What language does the auto-spell check in your version of TA use?Troll."
"Yes - I would imagine that people whose livelihood depends to any greater or lesser extent on visitors - and that must account for a significant proportion of Skye's population, will be absolutely thrilled to see visitors returning. However, those who are not involved in the tourist trade may well be a bit more wary.So it seems to me that as long as you act responsibly and conduct yourselves so as to minimise any transmission risks, your consideration and respect for the place will be appreciated.Edited: 4:22 pm, July 03, 2020 "
