Great news! I hope it works out well for everyone planning to visit and for the locals dependent on tourist visits
"They may be open, but it may be hard to find a flight..especially from the states! But so happy that Iceland will start to get their tourism back!!!"
And more information from the Icelandic government here https:/…

"I'm booked to fly out on June 26 from Toronto with IcelandAir and in spite of the good news, I wonder if my trip will actually happen.1. Will IA actually restart flights from Toronto in June? The route is currently suspended and IA is still allowing cancellations/issuing vouchers through June 30th.2. Will there be demand for this route/will people be willing to travel in June? (which ties into above).Edited: 3:19 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"There are direct flights from Newark on Icelandair still for mid JuneWe were supposed to go to Scotland this June 17-28, but that is not going to happen. Strongly considering making a trip back to Iceland now. We went last June, and it was fantastic. I have to read the article and find out exactly what the restrictions are to enter the country, but if it is possible, that is great.Edited: 3:47 pm, May 12, 2020 "
Interesting article. We are due to go on July 31st. I have already come to terms that we won't be going. I bought through Expedia with flight insurance for what it's worth. The article regarding Iceland Air going bankrupt is unsettling. I am feeling as if I may lose all my money. Eeek.
"As I predicted. Stay positive, tourists! Iceland will welcome you (if you are healthy) even if Hawaii will not."
"This is certainly positive news, at least for the tourist business in Iceland and those that have bookings later this summer. It is a bold and somewhat unexpected move from the Icelandic government, in particular that they do not seem to limit this to people from certain countries, like what was previously discussed. I guess it goes to show how completely desperate the situation for the important (for the ecomnomy) Icelandic tourist industry has become.I think Iceland may be currently one of the few countries that have a fair chance of pulling this off successfully at this stage. Many other European coutries are discussing relaxing the strict regulations in the future, but what I have seen have been on a smaller more limited scale and with slower progress than what Iceland is proposing now.Like it was written in another thread, the low population density along with the outdoor activity-oriented tourism in Iceland makes it slightly easier to handle effectively a situation like this.This must be very expensive for Iceland, it will consume a lot of money and resources to implement the measures that they are planning to take, including full screening of all arrivals etc. But I suppose this is cost that the Icelandic government is willing to shoulder in order to save the tourist industry from total collapse.I wonder how this will be recieved by potential visitors. Will Iceland be swamped with too many incoming visitors, potentially overwhelming their screening and control capacity? Or will the inherent travel restrictions in the rest of the world limit the number of arrivals to smaller numbers? These are interesting times indeed.Another thing to consider for people that may be planning to visit is to make sure your current travel insurance is still valid for this situation. In many countries, including here in Norway, ordinary travel insurance is not valid in areas of the world where the government is offcially recommending their citizens not to go. And currently the Norwegian goverment for example is recommending us not to go abroad at all, meaning basically that my travel insurance is void outside of my own country. This applies until the government changes their travel advisory. I also assume many travel insurance companies now have restrictions in their policies so that their insurance does not cover any kind of incidents related to any kind of effects related to the pandemic, even indirect. So double checking your travel insurance cover may be a wise thing to do before traveling.Even if Norway and Iceland has a joint health care agreement that implies that from a health care point of view I do not really need a travel insurance to get needed heath care while in Iceland, I still think I would be reluctant to go there without a valid travel insurance, for many reasons. Not that I am planning to visit this year, we have postponed our next planned visit until next year, so no Iceland for us for the first time in many years."
"This is a stunning news! I hoped I will be able to travel north this summer (so far it looked only southern states will open, but I'm not a fan of too much heat :)) and this seems like a perfect opportunity. I hope it works out with flights :)"
"As posted in anorher thread by me It is quite encouraging news .. we should get some clarity of implementation in few days.. and more so I believe many countries will follow similar precautions now and expect this to become SOP(Standered operating Process) for each country.The biggest question is , does not having COVID gives one confidence to travel till Vaccine is available? Any direct flights are safest and I would take a chance but for a person like me who had to change at 2 Airport Istanbul- Munich and Amsterdam- Istanbul in return will not take any chances till we are clear of handling of passengers at each of the airports. Unfortunately in our case I will also have to relay on Indian- Turkish- German- Dutch laws in current scenario... and it seems highly unlikely ..But Yes, we are gearing up to accept COVID and are learning to deal and live with it.."
"Exciting news indeed, but having to quarantine for two weeks on my return home will keep me from any travel for a while. My insurance also will no longer cover me for covid and travel, so that is a very real issue."
"This adds a bit more to the original link, concerning conditions to enter Iceland:https:/…The above states this: ""After being screened at the airport, arriving passengers will go to their overnight accommodations, where they await the results.""If you test positive, I assume you enter a 14 day quarantineto remain in Iceland. But if you test negative but someone onthe plane tested positive, do you also have to quarantine?Iceland has done a wonderful job of knocking the virus down. I would definitely feel safe in Iceland, but I sense the flight thereis where the danger of infection is quite real.Edited: 1:49 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"Getting a positive test on arrival could totally knock a two week trip on the head, let alone the costs incurred of in room dining and losing the planned trip."
"#11 ""The biggest question is , does not having COVID gives one confidence to travel till Vaccine is available?""It does to some, it doesn't to others. Tourism will be down significantly, but it will not be zero. Personally, I'm happy to travel. I'm not gonna hide in a cave until we have a vaccine (which we may get in a year, or in ten years). If I get sick, I'll get sick - I've accepted similar risks when I travelled before.Iceland is an ideal option for tourism in times of physical distancing with its vastness and considering the fact that most sights are out in the nature. Unless you opt for a packed bus tour of Golden Cirle (which I wouldn't recommend anyway), it is possible to spend a lovely day, while keeping minimal contact with other people.The only question is what happens if I test positive in Iceland. My idea is to get tested at home, day or two before travel to Iceland so that I don't travel if I'm infected. However, if the small chance of getting infected in between, I wonder what would be the procedure upon getting a positive test in Keflavik."
"#15 if you get tested before and have proof of that check it sounds like you would no longer get tested in Reykjavik as well. Since the virus has incubation period anyway it would be fairly useless to get tested again on arrival as if you were in fact unlucky to get infected in the plane over, it would not show up on a test yet.It will be interesting to see what the more specific procedures will be if someone else on the flight tests positive for the rest of the passengers. I would assume it would be notification via phone and some form of self isolation / quarantine similar to one they have today, where you are allowed to go outside for walks or drives as long as you keep social distance from others at all times. Installing the tracing app is going to be a must according to the article anyway, so it should be a lot easier to contact trace tourists if everyone has the app.Edited: 7:13 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"Thanks for pointing that out. That makes things even more easier, provided there is some kind of uniform medical certificate that will be accepted across the border.Quarantiing the whole aircraft sounds like an issue to me. If I'm in 2A and someone sitting in 24F tests positive, I'm not sure there's a lot of reason for quarantiing me. Perhaps it could only apply to passengers seated nearby, based on PLC cards, if at all. A320 has a capacity of 150 passengers, if it flies full, it is statistically likely that someone will be infected (that of course doesn't mean they infected anyone else on the plane - I'm still not sure there have been many documented cases of an infection spreading in an aircraft). That of course wouldn't apply if significant share of passengers tested before travel."
Link here shows passengers wearing Mask and Face shield who were flown from Singapore- India .. I believe this is one of the option and in time to come there will be many new process found / modified till things become normal..https://www.news18.com/news/auto/aviation-mi…Certainly tourisum will not become standstill but now this is a hope and first move taken by Iceland Govt and many will use this window to start visiting. World is at standstill and hereon things only have to move northward. We will keep finding new ways to deal with this now.Sad part is .. My window for this year is gone!!!
I am surprised nobody worries about the COVID-19 symptoms if somebody gets sick during the trip. Some people get horrible symptoms and yes some people have no symptoms but nobody knows how your body will react to the virus until you get it. So I will not take my chance even if they open the border. Travel and tourism will get back to normal when people have access to the vaccine.
"#19 I think that is just a risk some will be willing to take and some will not. And I think this is expected since it's pretty much impossible to answer with a high degree of confidence neither of the questions: 'how likely am I to get infected on the plane over?' and 'how likely am I to get a severe case of it if I do get infected?' So it just comes down to individual by individual when it comes to risk aversion, fear of the virus in the first place (e.g. are you in a susceptible group to begin with) and even financial situation (e.g. if worst case happen and you do get severe case while in Iceland can you afford potential treatment cost depending on what insurance you can / can't get).Edited: 3:57 am, May 14, 2020 "
"#19 - The same could be said about numerous other diseases that have been around for decades or centuries. Even flu can have very severe symptoms, possibly kill you - and while we have a vaccine, most younger people are not vaccinated. (Note: I'm not comparing Covid and flu, just pointing out that other dangerous infections have always been here and people still travelled).Vaccine may not be available for years or possibly decades. I don't think most people are willing to do nothing for such a long time. Many will be cautious for a while, then get used to the reality and move on."
"I am definitely covered for flu while travelling, but now I am definitely not covered for coivd 19. Can I afford multiple weeks in ICU? Can I afford for a prolonged stay in hotels for my partner whilst I am in hospital? These are my problems. I have absolutely no issues with flying, I would be on a plane tomorrow if I could go to Scotland., but travel with no medical insurance is something I would not take lightly now."
"That will definitely be an issue for many (indeed it's one of reasons why I wouldn't do longhaul travel at the moment). However EU citizens are covered for emergency health care by their regular health insurance, since Iceland is in EFTA. So there is at least one (major) source market where this issue isn't that significant."
"@The810, very smart thinking there. never even occurred to me, even though I am from the UK. Though non resident, so not covered. The EU market is indeed large enough to keep tourism ticking over."
"bogwoppit--That is our issue as well, being covered for any medical issues. I am still waiting to cancel as out trip is mid/late August, but right now it is not looking good."
"Bogdan, I think your response in #20 to Wtraveler2017 missed addressing the actual question about the “severity” of the symptoms exhibited during a flight that could last hours, “...if somebody gets sick during the trip. Some people get horrible symptoms...”One of the criteria for flying should be that there is an isolated area onboard any flight where someone who starts sneezing or coughing uncontrollably, vomiting, becomes faint or short of breath etc would be able to lie down, rest and also be kept away from other passengers. Also if the passenger becomes very ill, who will be responsible for looking after their needs?"
"We're really diverging from the OT, but as a doctor, I'd say if someone is sick enough to crump on the flight, they were probably sick enough not to pass screening before they got on. Surely not always, but almost always, and at that point, no more frequently than when passengers have medical issues when flying anyways.The much,much larger statistical risk is someone who is asymptomatic but still contagious just sitting there happily breathing and talking and touching things.It will be interesting to see what sorts of rules and regulations will appear as travel opens up again."
"I am another that will probably not be travelling as we won't be insured (and would have to face quarantines upon our return home et al, but insurance is the big concern).Also, I'd be traveling with a family of 4 and while it's not probable, it's still very possible that one of us would test positive upon arrival -- either as an asymptomatic carrier (the kids!) or more frustratingly, because of a false positive. And then what would we do? Unfortunately, elective tests aren't available here (you have to be symptomatic and referred by a doctor), so we wouldn't be able to tell before we went."
"Very good news. I’ve just had to cancel my trip (we were due to arrive this Sunday).Now hoping that we might be able to rebook for the autumn and salvage at least one trip during this awful year.Fingers crossed all goes well with the reintroduction of tourists.Edited: 4:00 pm, May 14, 2020 "
>>present a clean bill of health from the health authorities in their home countries <<That's pretty vague and seems open to fraud. I hope they outline exactly what that means in the coming weeks. It should be interesting.
"This is some positive news but I think at the end, individual's risk taking abilities will come into play. I have my trip panned for 2 weeks starting 10th July. I havent cancelled it yet and keeping my fingers crossed. If govt allows and Iceland opens, would definitely want to go there as I agree that Iceland is one of the best places to visit in covid times due to more of an outdoor place!"
"Would these rules also apply if one arrives via ferry, or is it for flights only? Since I'm very uncomfortable in a face mask, I'm trying to do what I can to avoid flying and I'm thinking about driving my own car, provided that Denmark opens up as well by that time (it seems I should be able to get as far as Germany by mid-June). The idea is to stay in Iceland for a month or two, so it could be convenient having my own car anyway."
"There are no specifics on it, as is now operator just mentions the 14 day quarantine on arrival until June 15th: https:/…covid-19-information I did a similar road trip 2 years back, do keep in mind though you will be spending 2 full days on the ferry (so risk wise it would be higher than on plane) and pay quite a bit more than a flight ticket."
"Thank you. I already did some research into this, still considering whether it's a realistic option for me or not, but the most important thing is not having to quarantine upon arrival :) Hopefully no specifics mean no restrictions (it wouldn't make sense to treat ferries differently, but these days I wouldn't be surprised by anything)."
"https:/…From June 15, however, tourists and Icelandic residents will be allowed to enter the country from outside the Schengen area, and all travellers given the option to get tested upon entering instead of undergoing quarantine. Authorities expect test results to be available the same day, and those who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 will not be required to quarantine themselves.Testing will be done at KEF for arriving flights, but no mention of testing being done at the ferry landing. Failure to test, or have your own documentation of a recent negative test, means 14 day quarantine."
That's even better news! The first reports did not indicate if Iceland would open to travelers beyond the Schengen (EU) zone and the UK. But from the latest report it sounds like Iceland will look for a way to open up to all tourists including USA. Smart to be the first to the post as people are looking to make plans now. Airfares have already jumped $1000 RT on the flights I was watching. Hawaii is at the other end of the spectrum and will basically be writing off the summer.
"Just an update (and reality check, I guess):The lastest news indicate that there are still obstacles that could potentially delay the whole plan to open by the 15th:https:/…So, anyone planning to arrive in June may want to make sure they have a plan B in case the opening is not happening on the planned date."
Update about testing at KEF:https:/…
And another update on the same subject:https://www.ruv.is/frett/2020/05/28/question…
"Yes, it definitely seems like there is a bit of a spat between Kári Stefánsson and Svandís Svavarsdóttir, but a follow-up interview said that he would be talking in more depth with Þórólfur Guðnason (after a sort of hilariously misinterpreted comment about KS blocking him on his phone), so we'll see."
They have made friends :)https:/…calming-waters-in-border-test-dispute
"It seems to me that it would be far more sensible to test people before they travel (i.e. requiring a medical certificate before boarding). This way there's no need for increasing testing capacity at KEF and no need to solve what to do with people who test positive.Edited: 10:22 am, May 30, 2020 "
"Many countries don't offer testing for people without symptoms, so that might deter quite a few potential visitors."
"Yeah, I couldn't get a test if I wanted one. I actually see a buisness opportunity running quarantine/test centres at major airports globally: Transit into the quarantine centre, have a test, stay in the quarantine centre while you await the test results (maybe 24 hrs?) and then on to your vacation. Currently, Canada has no options for private testing, with all testing resources been applied within the public system and tests done on a priority basis as determined by the health system. As we haven't even opened up to domestic travel with in the province yet (despite being in the single digits for a good week now and all cases being traceable to known outbreaks) they aren't going to free up the resources for testing on demand I don't think.Its a shame, but we are doing OK, so I won't complain....yet. Clearly definitive test results are going to be key to international travel for the next couple of years.Really, you want to test people on arrival anyway, I would think, as the air in the airplanes is going to be one of the highest risk environments for the near future.Edited: 10:32 pm, May 30, 2020 "
"In India we already have 3 incidents where in All crew members as well as passengers been asked to quarantine as one of the passenger tasted positive...A flight from Delhi to Moscow was called back as Captain tested positive.. Fortunately its was an empty flight on its way to get back stranded Indians. Hence question here is... what happens to rest if one test positive on arrival..? Which rule will be applicable? Above incident indicates that things can change dramatically drastic and that too in foreign country for any tourist!! Unless there is a window and people are asked to continue their travel and report back if any symptoms pop up during visit!! Which I think is the only option to encourage people to start travelling freely...And above all depending on risk taking ability of individual... Brave will lead from the front and rest will follow in due course... Cheers..Edited: 11:31 pm, May 30, 2020 "
"""Clearly definitive test results are going to be key to international travel for the next couple of years."" - I highly doubt that. That may work for holidaymakers who take two trips per year, but not for business travellers who travel on weekly basis, commuters, etc. In Europe, borders where test is required are generally consider to be closed, because that requirement is prohibitive for any short trips (I live 20 minutes from Austrian border, normally I would cross it on almost daily basis, but I'm not gonna take 3 tests per week) and every effort is made to allow travel without tests as soon as possible. Tests are only a short term solution, they are not practical in a long term.""the air in the airplanes is going to be one of the highest risk environments for the near future"" - That's not true. For some reason it's a popular myth, but the reality is quite the opposite. New planes use combination of fresh air and recycled air that goes through HEPA filters, which are highly efficient and can capture over 99 percent of particles, including viruses. Plane is not a risk environment."
"I think business travel will be greatly reduced for a while if not for good as companies resort to virtual meetings rather than taking a flight somewhere.I agree that flying may not be as risky as spending hours with others in a smaller enclosed room without air circulation, but it is still an added risk you take, since you will be in close proximity with strangers for a longer time and you won't know how diligent they may have taken their social distancing before getting on the plane. In addition getting to an airport via bus or train and waiting at the airport will be an added risk."
"KimT--I agree about business travel. My husband used to go to Germany a lot for work, and that came to screeching halt. I joined him on his last trip, which was late January and we added on time into February. Right as everything hit. I felt we were lucky to get home. He had another trip back for early April, and that was pushed back to June, and of course that is totally scrapped now. So he does virtual meetings every week with his German colleagues."
Does anyone know when the next update is coming? The original release said prior to the end of the month which has passed. Thinking of rolling the dice on a last minute trip but was waiting on the update
"https:/…https:/…Looks like the plan is confirmed, but the government may not be paying for tests. The good news is that it looks like testing is finally starting to become more widely available in the US. I just got an email from my medical practice in DC offering the option to schedule a viral or antibody test whenever I want."
"Testing here in WA is only if you have symptoms. I think we have a long ways to go before this is available to most people, but of course that is just my speculation."
Thanks for the links lebsam. Still so many questions:What happens to passenger 501 when they run out of tests?Where will passengers wait for test results?What happens to passengers on the same plane as an infected individual?Will incoming tourists be free to board the Flybus before getting test results?Will infected pseengers be allowed an honor system quarantine or be housed together?Hopefully we'll get more info in the next week.
Exactly what I have in mind. I’m arriving around mid night. Will I be allowed to go to the BnB or will I have to stay at the airport for the night. I’m fine with staying overnight at the airport but only issue is what will happen to others if one passenger is tested positive in the whole flight.
"I have checked and I will have the chance to take a pcr and possibly antibody test at home before I leave, as long as I pay for them myself. So I will do that to be less dependent on testing capacity in Iceland. It will still be short notice and I would still lose some money, but at least I could rebook my flight and stay home if I teat positive.I might also not book tours and accommodation before, since availability should be better this summer than usually."
Great that you are able to take PCR tests in Germany. I don’t think you need antibody test then as it will anyway not be accepted. I think I’ll have to rely on the testing at airport only as Sweden is allowing testing via doctor reference only.
"I'll probably do both, since a positive antibody test would give me peace of mind in knowing that I am most likely not a danger to others and can maybe start seeing friends again.Plus my doctor said the antibody test might even be free for me, the pcr test is 160€."
"A lot of information was released yesterday.Announcement: https:/…Passenger Information: https:/…Passengerinfo.pdfThe key point (mainly from the second link) for me are:====================- You have to fill out a pre-registration form with contact information, travel information, intended first destination etc. before arrival- Tests at home are not accepted, testing has to be done in Iceland (""At this time, the Icelandic health authorities cannot accept proof of test results"")- PCR Testing is free from June 15-July 1 and ISK 15 000 (~100 EUR/USD) afterwards- You take your test at the airport and are then allowed to leave, even before receiving the results ("" Following the test, passengers can travel onward to their registered address (provided in their pre-registration form). Passengers do not need to self-quarantine until they receive their test results"")- Results are expected to be released within 24 hrs per app or text + phone call in case of positive test ("" Passengers can expect to receive their test results within 24 hours"")- If the test is positive, there might be additional testing to make sure and if it's confirmed, you have to self-isolate ("" they may be offered to undergo further tests to determine whether or not they have an active infection. In the case of an active infection, the passenger must self-isolate."")- A location for self.-isolation is provided free of charge, probably not a 5 star hotel though :) (""will be given accommodation at a specialised isolation centre at no cost to them"")- Further diagnosis / treatment after the initial test (after July 1) is also free of charge apparently (""Medical examination, treatment or medical supervision of notifiable diseases, including COVID-19, is of no cost to the patient. This does not apply to an elective PCR-test for the diagnosis of COVID-19."")====================I believe that's about as much as they can reasonably do to make the process as easy as possible for travellers. In general it answers many of my questions, especially you're not forced to wait in the airport, if the testing capabilities are overwhelmed and the financial risk appears to be acceptable,at least under the assumption, that you only book accommodation/ tours from one day to another (or at least with max 2-3 days cancellation policy). Of course there are still some points on which they are vague. For example, what *exactly* happens when someone on the plane was infected.So, what do you guys think? Is booking for July a go for you? I'm still on the fence, but leaning towards yes, if I can find enough accommodation and a good rental car deal with flexible cancellation options."
"I'm hoping to go in August. That plan sounds reasonable. My only real fear is that upon implementation, they find it's not working/realistic/etc, and the rules change again. We are also, by and large, only booking lodging and activities that are fully refundable/cancellable, just in case."
"This is really great information! As you said, everything looks fine with only exception of what happens if someone is tested positive in the plane but I believe that too will be sorted in coming days. So I’m on for my July trip:)"
This sounds good. I would absolutely willing to travel under these circumstances. The only thing that puts me off is the face mask requirement on most airlines (no way I can wear that thing for several hours) :/
"Without the mask you cannot protect others if you are presymptomatic or asymptomatic. I am not looking forward to it either, but I believe people should not be flying without a mask."
"Nor can I with a mask (as far as we know). But I don't want to start a flame, there have been many on this topic. I respect whatever the regulation is. I'm just saying I'm not flying as long as such regulation exists. For now I'm sticking with the driving distance (luckily, I have several cities with fairly relaxed rules available). If Denmark relaxes their rules, I will consider driving + ferry to Iceland, because I'd really like to visit this year.Edited: 5:05 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"I will only feel safe to fly if all airlines and airports require all passengers to wear a mask without any exception and reject any passenger to even step in the front door of the airport if he or she refuses to wear a mask. Also, there should be a very heavy fine if a passenger decides to violate the rules on the plane. For those passengers who can't wear a mask for some health issues, they should wait till the pandemic is over. After all, this is non-essential travel and if they can't wear a mask, they should wait till everything goes back to normal. I think Iceland is safe from this virus, but the problem is getting there may not be safe."
"We now know how someone on a flight who tests positive will impact others:The contact tracing team interviews those who have been in close contact with a confirmed active case during two days prior to the onset of symptoms , e.g. been within 2 meters of an individual for more than 15 minutes, or those who have sat close to an infected individual on an airplane (usually within two seat-row radius). They might be required to self-quarantine for two weeks from the time of last contact.A negative test result does not guarantee that an individual will not later be required to self-quarantine if they have been exposed to infection, e.g. on the flight to Iceland.Scroll down to ""In the event of an obligatory self-quarantine"":https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/fret…So if someone on your plane tests positive, and you were seated within a 2m radius of that passenger, even if you test negative, you may face self-quarantine. At least, that how I read it. IEdited: 9:49 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"In the link above, click on the ""see further information here"" which will bring up a pdf file.Scroll down per above in that pdf file."
"100 Euro is way too high, should be at least only half of that."
In my region in Germany private pcr testing is 160€. As far as I know the testing procedure is fairly expensive.
"Yes, that’s how I read it too. This maybe a deal breaker and it’s also unreasonable to expect airlines to keep 2 meters distance in seating arrangement. Not sure what Spain and other countries plan to do when they say they would allow quarantine free tourism from 1st July."
"The plan is simple: Accept there is a new disease and move on with our lives. Ultimately, that's the only thing we can do, unless we're ready to keep hiding for several years (if not decades).I still don't understand the fuss about planes. In last two weeks I visited several bars and pubs that were packed with people. I was seated mere centimeters from others and came to close contact with much more people than I would on a plane. Yet, no one makes a big deal out of it - and so far it seems that places that I visited (Czechia and Hungary), which relaxed their rules a while ago didn't get a new peak as result.But somehow planes are deemed different, even though there is far less human contact, people are not facing each other and there is superior air circulation system. I just don't get it. But in any case, I don't fancy being treated like a bio weapon, so until airlines change their attitude, I will stick to driving and places where I can feel like a human.I believe that meassures in Iceland are reasonable and I would have a great time, but the travel itself is too much hassle. By the way, it seems Icelandair doesn't require masks (but unfortunatelly they don't fly anywhere near my location).Edited: 6:13 am, June 07, 2020 "
"Agree with you that disease is there for some time in future. Your risk taking ability depends on what is at stake too. I’m going to all the restaurants, shopping places like IKEA in Stockholm but I know the risk is manageable that even if I contract, I sit tight at home for next 2 weeks. See what happened in Spain last week when a passenger tested positive. I think people will gain more confidence as we go into flying more and more."
"I would be far more worried about invalid travel and health insurances than contracting the virus on a plane or at an airport. On board aircrafts, social distancing cannot be maintained, hence the masks. Norway has a requirement for middle seat free on average size aircrafts and every other seat free on the smaller aircrafts - one can imagine airlines are not happy about that in these dire times when there are substantial resque packages and bankruptcy lurking behind the scenes."
"How open is Iceland right now?If one goes there on 6/15, will most restaurants be open? Will activities be back to normal? Are most hotels accepting visitors normally?If one will probably only go to Iceland once, and they go now, how will the experience be different?"
"Post #71 that is the only thing holding us back. We are all booked for mid/late August and are changing t 2021 instead. Our medical insurance does not cover us outside of the US, so we bought travel insurance last fall and that does not cover pandemics. So we are not willing to take that much of a risk!"
Plane/ restaurant/ IKEA/ Bars/ Pubs or any place is just a reason for anyone to get contaminated while out of comfort zone... ultimately it all depends on one’s immunity to keep Virus away... All the above places will provide an individual reasons and allow people to put up an legitimate claim on a place where they got from .. WHICH IS MORE SO Due TO LACK OF INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.... So people will venture out... test their immunity level along with the reasons provided to step out of comfort zone...
"#72 most places are open right now with some form or restrictions in place (shorter hours typically). It is a LOT less crowded than usual, so from that standpoint it's definitely a better place to enjoy the attractions once you do get here. Just for concrete examples here, 2 years ago in end of March / start of April (which is far off peak tourist season) I still remember Thingvellir being full of tourists, Geysir parking lot jammed packed. Now I did same trip last weekend, there were maybe 10 cars total at Thingvellir and Geysir was 90% empty. For me at least this was amazing, it was a lot more peaceful so I ended up enjoying them more. Of course, this is just me, and it comes at the cost of risking infection on the way here, likely lacking travel insurance and possibility of quarantine once you do get here. So in the end it will be up to you what kind of risk you want to take.Edited: 5:27 am, June 08, 2020 "
"@satkaj You post is more than a little confusing. "" a claim"" for what? Implying that people already have immunity is contrary to what the medical advice is. Sweden tried ""herd immunity"" and we all know how that worked out for them."
"Regarding the concerns for health insurance not covering outside the US - Based on the below statement, can someone explain why that would still be a concern? I want to make sure I'm thinking everything through.""Further diagnosis / treatment after the initial test (after July 1) is also free of charge apparently (""Medical examination, treatment or medical supervision of notifiable diseases, including COVID-19, is of no cost to the patient. This does not apply to an elective PCR-test for the diagnosis of COVID-19."")"""
"brennaabroad--For me, I'm not willing to chance that if I get infected that medical treatment would be provided at no cost. That is the statement now, but that could easily change, just as the cost of the test is changing. I would not want to be anywhere and not have medical coverage. My husbands coworker got Covid back in January and did not know until the end of the trip. We were all in Europe. On a Wednesday night we were having dinner together, and by Friday when he flew back to the US, he ended up in ICU on the east coast. He STILL has not made it back to Seattle. He is lucky to be alive, although it is still very touch and go. Hospital for over 2 months, respiratory rehab for a few weeks, at his daughters for a couple week, and now back in the hospital on a ventilator AGAIN. Seeing this first hand, I am not willing to chance this at this time. The rules etc are changing almost daily and for me, it is outside of my comfort level. If our insurance covered us, I would go in a heartbeat. Instead we are cancelling out August trip and postposing it until next year. Disappoint, yes, but for us the right thing to do."
"I have also no idea what post #74 is trying to say.My understanding of how we should proceed with social interactions is to assume that we have no immunity and that we could be a healthy carrier at all time, and conduct ourselves accordingly. Even people who have developped antibodies for the virus are not guaranteed to be immune, in the light of the current scientific knowledge."
"Agree with post # 79. As per the current understanding, no one can have complete immunity from corona. So basically we have to live with it and assume that we can catch it if we don't follow hygiene. The thing is, can we wait to travel till there's a vaccination (which may take more than a year) or should we take a calculated risk? Even if there's a vaccination, it would never come down to '0' cases! I'm up for travel again and would stay away from vulnerable groups during/after the travel so that I dont transmit to them. What Iceland govt is doing is the best one can hope. Rest, everyone should individually decide!"
"My insurance will not cover me whilst my country has warned against non essential travel. So Iceland would cover me for covid, if I arrived with it, I would spend my two weeks in a cheap hotel instead of enjoying the ring road.But, and this is a big but. If I fly, do not have covid, then get in a car accident, my insurance would not cover my treatment, and certainly would not cover a medivac, or family coming out to be with me. You need to examine your insurance for more than just covid related costs right now. Unless you can afford to self insure, which I cannot."
"I've talked to my insurance company today and they do not have any limitations in terms of Covid-19 specifically or pandemics in general. That's good news.Today a press conference regarding testing and border control procedures took place. I only have a source in German right now (https:/…), perhaps someone can find something in English. For the most part they did repeat what we already discussed over the last couple of days with some caveats:- They are planning to have testing capabilities of 2k/day ""after a month"". Entry will be refused for anyone beyond thee capabilities. They don't state what exactly that means.- The last tests of a day are performed at 7pm/19:00. That does not work well with most flights from Germany for example, which generally arrive later in the evening. So it's what, at least a night in the airport...Unfortunately it's all a bit too uncertain. I'll wait around and if there are major changes until June 15 I might book something last minute, but I've decided to not make any plans for now.Edited: 1:01 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"It seems bookings are not very good. There are ridiculously cheap hotels available in downtown Reykjavik and Hilton just pulled two of their three Reykjavik properties from sale until end of June. I'm not surprised tbh, the situation is too unclear and general panic is still very much alive in certain parts of Europe.If it's true that anyone who arrives after daily quota was reached will be denied entry, that's a definitive no-go for me. I was reconsidering my options in last couple of days and I figured I could actually fly from MUC with Icelandair (they do not require masks on board, so this obstacle would be overcomed), but I won't pay hundreds of euros, only to be turned at the border and sent back home. I can't imagine anyone else feeling differently. If I'm finally going to travel somewhere after over 4 months, I need a reassurance that it will be a smooth experience.Edited: 2:32 pm, June 08, 2020 "
Can anyone please share the link where it is said that passengers will be turned back if the arrivals exceed 2000 people a day? All I read at different sites is that daily cap is 2000 and that would probably mean night at the airport maybe.
"I don't think anyone is talking about being turned back. I also expect that if the number is exceeded, people have to wait in the airport (terminal) until the next morning. Same applies to flights, which arrive later in the evening. And even then, I've read in another forum, that at least one rental car company is currently planning to only give rental cars to people with a confirmed negative test result. I of course can't comment on weather that's accurate or not, but it adds even further to the uncertainty."
"Refused entry normally means being sent back home, but hopefully that won't be the case. Still, if you spend the night at the airport, what next? You'll get tested in the morning and that will make quota for that day's arrivals even smaller, forcing even more people to once again spend the night at the airport.Sounds too messy for me. In the beginning it looked like Iceland will have one of most generous policies, now I'm becoming convinced it will be one of the toughest places in Europe to go on a holiday this year."
"The number of people arriving each day is not unpredictable. You know the flights and the capacity of them. Having more people consistently arriving than they have tests for will create chaos in their airport and they have to know that. With the quality of their COVID-19 response it seems like the chances of getting this right are really high.This process is quite reassuring and hopefully will set a model for other countries. Now if they could just get everyone to wear N95 masks on airplanes, air travel would become one of the least risky parts of our lives again.Edited: 5:44 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"Having studied this document, if you want to go on holiday to Iceland this Summer, you need to factor in £90 (or equivalent) for a test on arrival. Looking at flights from where I live, departures from London Luton at 6.15 in the morning at £30, I imagine it'll probably be possible to space out so you're not sitting within 2 rows of anyone else! https:/…Passengerinfo.pdf"
"#87 An N95 mask requires a special fitting, they are not for the general population. But a fabric mask or a regular surgical mask would be fine for travel."
Where are people finding these cheap hotel deals?! I can't find any good offers at all!
"#87 So it's confirmed? Icelandair doesn't require to wear a face mask on their flights?I can't find this information on their website, and their customer service is not answering.I've booked my trip to Iceland in january, and I'm willing to go, but I really don't like the idea of spending more than 4 hours sitting on a plane with 200 people not wearing masks..."
I doubt people will feel safe to fly if masks are not required. I personally will not fly if masks are not required. The pandemic is not over yet.
"It seems wearing face masks on board will be required, at least for the first weeks...https:/…"
"""I doubt people will feel safe to fly if masks are not required."" - People who are afraid of COVID will not travel anyway, whether others wear (useless) masks or not. There are far higher risks during a trip. In Iceland itself, one will come into contact with far more people not wearing mask than they would on board an aircraft... At the same time, airlines are losing customers who are not afraid to travel, because they make the experience terrible. I can't wait to fly again, but I will not do it if I'm denied proper access to oxygen for several hours. Wearing it for 10 minutes while I shop is painful enough.It's a pity to see Icelandair changing their mind on the policy. I guess I'll stick to driving this year."
Wearing a mask for ten minutes while shopping is hardly painful...The article states that wearing masks means people next to an infected person wouldn't have to quarantine so I think it's a much better solution.
"Wearing a mask means you are willing to pretect others from yourself in case you are contagious without having symptoms. In my opinion a little bit of discomfort is not too high a price to pay for that. I would rather travel with considerate people close to me for a few hours, so of course I am willing to do the same for them. Inidivdualism won't help here, we can only mitigate the risk for the majority of people if everyone is willing to do their (small) part."
"Being denied breathing is not ""a small part"". General wearing of masks is not proved to be efficient. There is no known outbreak to be related to an aircraft spread. You will remove your mask while eating anyway. During your stay in Iceland, you will encounter far more people without masks than on the plane.It simply doesn't make any sense and won't help anyone. It will just discourage people from travelling. People afraid of Covid will not travel anyway.If anything, let's introduce two zones in planes. One with compulsory masks, another without them. That way the two groups don't have to mix. And bookings will show what is actually preferred by travellers."
"Interesting article about transmission of a virus in a plane : https://www.stripes.com/scientists-think-the…I don't think there is a situation in daily life when you are for several hours in very close contact with many other people in a tightly confined space. In my country masks are mandatory on public transport, required in many shops, and I'm required to wear them at work when I'm in a confined room with someone else. Passing someone in the street is very different than seating for several hours centimeters away from someone else. Masks are useful in restraining the spread of the virus if everybody wears them. If your mask is denying you breathing, it may be that it is not appropriate, or you have a breathing problem. It's not comfortable nor fun to wear a mask but you should be able to wear one for a bit of time without suffocating (health professionals do it every day). I think I would be OK to fly if masks are required, not if they are not."
Freddy and Kim--I agree 100%. I would actually give my business to any airline that requires masks over one that does not.
"I think The810 has a fair point, there is basically 0 mask wearing inside Iceland right now, so you will just end up running into similar groups of people in hotels, restaurants etc. Not to mention even now it's not clear how much this will actually protect in case of asymptomatic people (as shown by recent WHO statements that still we just don't know how likely these are to spread it in first place)."
"If I do travel in a few weeks I will be in my car or hiking out in nature once in Iceland and will not have any prolonged contact with others, especially not in a confined space for several hours at a time. I think getting to Iceland will pose the highest risk and once I have arrived and am on my way there will be less risk than in Germany.Masks do reduce the risk of drop or aerosol infection, even more so if both people are wearing one and wear it correctly and health care professionals wear them all day without any problems. WHO retracted their statement on asymptomatic carriers.Mostly I have found that the people who are wearing masks want to protect others, and the ones who are adamant about not wearing one are primarily thinking about their own comfort.I for one am glad that masks are required in places were you cannot keep your distance, like on public transport, in stores or on planes. I guess people who don't want to wear one and have no health reasons for it will simply have to avoid these places as long as the rules are in place."
"Fully agree with Kim T on all points. I'm hoping that hotels and restaurants are geared up in such a way that they allow for physical distancing. If not, I would probably try to avoid them. Bars and restaurants in France have re-opened with physical distance requirements between tables and mandatory masks for the staff (not for the customers of course). I have seen some places were those measures were not taken seriously and I just take my business somewhere else. Of course the virus is probably circulating more in France than in Iceland right now."
"Kim T: Will you not shop for groceries or eat at restaurants? Because you would be meeting plenty of people in those situations, and no, they most likely won't wear a mask. Same goes for hotels, there will be some contact, whether it's with staff or other customers (think about elevator for example). I've been travelling again for the last two weeks (although not in the Iceland) and I was pleasantly surprised that hotels I visited provided almost normal service with only very minor changes (and even those changes seemed to be motivated by commercial reasons, i.e. lack of customers). Same applies to bars and restaurants in cities which I visited, the experience was absolutely normal (except some staff wearing masks), so I can't wrap my head around why are planes treated like some dangerous enviroment. On my last visit to a bar I came in close contact with far more people than I would on a plane.I wonder how many of those who say they will only travel if face masks are compulsory will actually put their money where they're mouth is. I'm convinced that most people who are pro-compulsory masks will not travel anyway."
"I am pro-compulsory masks in closed spaces, and yes, I am travelling. Going to do some shopping is not at all like sitting for hours elbow to elbow with a stranger in a narrow space. Since the lockdown has ended, we're trying to live our lives as we did before, just with a few more precautions. One of these is wearing a face mask when on public transport or inside shops, because these are the rules here, but also because it is safer and respectful of other's health. Anyway, I've been to Iceland three times, and never met two hundred people, apart from waterfalls..."
"You know you won't be seated within 2 meters of 200 other people on an aircraft, right? :) By the way, masks can be removed while eating and drinking. So the person you're sitting elbow-to-elbow with will have a chance to infect you anyway...It. Just. Doesn't. Make. Any. Sense."
"Did you read the article posted in #98?I'm not saying compulsory face masks on airplanes can eliminate any risk. I'm saying they can reduce risks. Not wearing masks at all is the only choice that doesn't make any sense: we don't have absolute certainties about this virus, so precautionary principle is the only thing that make sense right now."
"I will be hiking/backpacking for about half of my visit.Check-in is a few minutes of human contact at a distance, grocery shopping is maybe 10 minutes, and I will probably get take-out rather than sitting down at a restaurant, but even if I do, I will be at my own table and have maybe a few minutes contact with my server while ordering if that.So no prolonged contact with anyone, much less sitting close to them in a confined space for four hours. Not comparable at all in my opinion.For me it's all about reducing the risk, because the more risks I take, the more I am a possible danger to others I come in contact with. The more careful I am, the less risk I pose for others. For me that is an easy decision to make."
"Also pro-mask but plan to travel. The decision to make masks required on the plane and thus not force people near someone who tests positive to quarantine was a huge point for me in whether or not the trip was worth the risk.I wear my mask when I go out in public places right now (if indoors or in close proximity outdoors), and while it certainly won't be enjoyable to do so for hours and hours on a plane and at airports, it will make me feel much more comfortable with my decision to travel."
"If you are arguing against wearing a mask, you are clearly just looking for justification not to wear one because you find it uncomfortable. There is absolutely no harm in wearing a mask other than your own discomfort, where as it can absolutely lower the risk of transmission. Obviously there are circumstances such as eating and drinking when you have to remove a mask, but the more you wear it the more you are preventing droplets from your mouth from getting on other people. For transmission of the virus, studies have shown that for people who aren't coughing and sneezing, time plus exposure equals viral load. More viral load equals greater chance of infection. So if you are sitting one row from someone who is COVID positive, your chances of being infected by them are much greater if they don't wear a mask at all for than if they wear one for 4 hours and remove it for 1 hour."
It seems that most reasonable is to wait little bit to see what will happen. I can quarantine myself at home for two weeks before trip and also I can go to do test day before flying but I really want to know that how will be handled situation where I test negative for Covid19 but somebody in same flight gets positive diagnose. I don't like lotteries (as I never win) and it seems a gamble little bit if they quarantee other people in plane if some stranger from plane is diagnosed for Cov19.And I really hope that masks will be mandatory. If somebody doubts about this then I suggest read https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-basic-dance-steps-everybody-can-follow-b3d216daa343 - there are really good explanation why to wear masks. Of course it is not miracle cure but if everybody wears them then risk of infection will be much smaller.
"I will actually not go in a restaurant if the tables are too close at the moment, not get into an elevator if it means being close to other people (unless we all wear masks). You can do your shopping quickly and you do not stay in contact with someone else for an extended period of time, and if a shop is too crowded I'll go somewhere else. And I never forget that I can be the one unknowingly carrying the virus.The810 you come from a country that seems to have had so far a limited impact of the virus, and good for you. Same goes thankfully for Iceland so far, but it's not the same in every country in Europe, and people from those countries, such as mine, where the virus is still circulating, will be allowed to travel to Iceland soon. Greece has allowed tourist to fly in since earlier this month, and there have been reports of a flight that had over 20 people testing positive on arrival on a 91-passenger flights... I would not get into a flight full of French (or UK, or Italian...) people without required masks for everyone.To be honest my trip is planned for August so there is still a bit of time for things to settle down, and for me to make up my mind. I probably wouldn't travel in June at all."
"Icelandair has made the masks compulsory for everyone in the flight from 15th June. I would say it’s a step in the right direction. Icelandair official also mentioned that if the masks are being worn by everyone, then quarantine requirement for anyone sitting close to a positive passenger may not be needed! I think this is the best news I was hoping for but would see how it is being implemented on the ground."
"I'm a surgeon. I've spent the better part of 30 years wearing masks, sometimes as long as 10 hours a day. Wearing one on a flight does not bother me. As oxygen particles are 150 picometers small (1/1,000,000 the size of a respiratory droplet) there is certainly enough oxygen getting thru a mask. Anyone who thinks otherwise must also assume every OR and ER staff are working with altered mental function from hypoxia. Most assuredly that is not the case.Absolutely agree the issue is viral load any given person is exposed to which determines their risk of developing an infection. That depends on how infectious the surrounding people are (and the WHO clarified ""pre-symptomatic vs a-symptomatic - makes no difference at the moment), how long you are exposed to them, and the size/air flow of the space you are in. Coding a very sick person in a small ER room - high risk of transmitting an infection. Passing someone who feels well on an open air sidewalk - low risk of transmitting enough viral particles to result in infection. People sitting together for hours in recirculated air, like a plane or restaurant - moderate risk. Masks help prevent this by not only preventing our own respiratory droplets from getting out into the environment, but also blocking at least some of those from other people from entering our lungs. Of note, this only works when wear the mask over your nose too.i'm glad the airlines are requiring masks. I'm also anxious to see how the testing, etc, works before I buy my ticket for August."
"Iceland wants to welcome tourists. But they also have a successful (fanatical maybe) virus control regime. It is unfortunate that they decided testing in the centres that Iceland aim to fly from is not reliable enough for them and all tourists have to arrive in Iceland not knowing if they will have to quarantine.. a sobering if small risk. According to their website data there are also 813 persons (as I read this) currently in quarantine although only 3 infected. You could be quarantined it seems just by sitting near someone on the flight over who tests positive). Whilst quarantine for a resident may be a nuisance for a tourist it will be a devastating blow destroying the reason they came. I hope Iceland will take a measured and pragmatic view of their zeal, like the rest of Eurooe who have decided to risk opening their boarders with some trepidism because they know they have to accept some risk. A little assurance from the Iceland Health and Tourism Authorities would be welcome here... does anybody agree ????"
"What do you expect them to say? Isolation or quarantine in case of infection or exposure are necessary measures to keep the virus spread under control and avoid exponential growth. They cannot waive these measures, just because they are inconvenient. That would increase the risk for both Icelanders and visitors.The risk of ending up in quarantine is something everyone planning to travel during the pandemic will have to take into account. I don't think there is a way around it, at least not while traveling in countries that take the virus threat seriously.And I guess there is currently no realistic way of knowing if a pcr test result confirmation in a foreign language from any of a dozen countries is legitimate and official or not..."
"With all the testing and possible quarantine requirements it now seems Iceland will be one of the least accessible places for European this summer. That's rather ironic, considering only a month ago it seemed like the only reasonable getaway. Still, I would like to visit, if I can get there by a ferry (i.e. if Denmark opens) or if airlines get rid of this mask nonsense.""There is absolutely no harm in wearing a mask other than your own discomfort, where as it can absolutely lower the risk of transmission."" - Untrue. There are negative health effects of prolonged mask wearing, several medical proffesionals pointed that out, but they are being ignored because it doesn't fit the dogma. ""Icelandair official also mentioned that if the masks are being worn by everyone, then quarantine requirement for anyone sitting close to a positive passenger may not be needed!"" - If this is the case, it just goes to prove this is just a security theatre because it makes zero sense. Even those who advocate for masks always point out that they are only an additional measure, which does not replace social distancing and its efficiency is far from 100%. The decision to not quarantine person sitting by an infected passenger just because they wore mask doesn't make any sense from scientific point of view. Especially if we consider that mask can be removed e.g. during a meal service. Don't get me wrong, I fully support not quarantining people just because someone else on the flight tested positive. But doing so on basis of mask wearing is completely and utterly irrational.Edited: 2:44 am, June 11, 2020 "
"I strongly disagree. Iceland has turned in a masterful performance in limiting the destruction of lives in Iceland by this virus. And they did it by testing, and not going into a full lockdown mode.What gives you the right to complain? If you do not care for their rules of entry, if being quarantined in Iceland at Iceland's expense is ""a devistating blow"", should you really even consider going?Iceland makes the rules based on what is best for Iceland. If you can't deal with that, find someplase else to go."
"The810, you have said what you have to say about masks, so you should just leave it there. Iceland will maketheir rules, and if you want to visit Icealnd, you will need to follow those rules.If a mask is so offensive to you, please consider some other destination.Edited: 3:14 am, June 11, 2020 "
"I don't agree with #114. Currently Iceland has done rather well in controlling the spread of the virus (which may be easier to do in a small island with not a lot of inhabitants, but still). In many countries that had also good success, the new emerging cases are very often brought by people arriving from abroad, so it's understandable they want to keep on protecting their population. Wearing a mask on a plane for a limited time and getting tested on arrival is not that big of a constraint. If people feel that there is too many risks associated with either catching the virus or being put in quarantine (and I can understand these feelings), then it's better to wait before travelling. I also understand that they currently can't rely on a test result from another country. There are many different tests, some of which can give false results depending on the conditions in which they are done, and you can't know if someone has taken a reliable test. Also, not everybody has access to a test in their country. For instance I could get an antibody test as I wish, but to get a PCR-based test of the presence of the virus this would have to be prescribed by my doctor, and currently only in case of suspicion of the disease or suspicion of close contact with someone who has it. I can't get one just because I need a result to travel.Testing people when they arrive insures that the people who walk around in Iceland are in the overwhelming majority virus-free, so it's less of a problem if you are in contact with other people who do not wear a mask ;)"
"drr49: Just to be clear, I'm perfectly fine with Icelandic rules and I would be happy to adhere to them (AFAIK, Iceland doesn't have and never had compulsory masks). The problem is the airline."
"The810, you won't be wearing it for prolonged use. You'd be wearing it for a 4-5 hour flight. I doubt very much that will have an adverse effect on your health."
"The810,Weather or not should people be wearing a mask in public has become a big debate.First thing first, a face mask does not only protect me. If I wear it, it may not prevent me from getting covid-19. In fact, I could very easily get covid-19 if I am the only one wearing a mask. When I wear a mask, it is to protect others as well. It could be you. So when I wear a mask in public, I am not making a political statement, I am saying you know what, I am a good person and I don’t think I have covid-19 and I hope I never get it, but if this is one little thing I could do to prevent other people from catching covid-19, then I am willing to do that. I am really amazed at what I am seeing. There is a screaming match going on about people who do and don’t wear a face mask in public or people you think should or should not wear a face mask in public. I am on the should side. I think everybody during this unprecedented time should be doing their part and wearing a face mask is one small thing we can all do to try to reduce the presence of covid-19. I read somewhere that if everybody had worn a face mask from the beginning, the death count would have been as 80% lower than it is today so what’s the big sacrifice about wearing a mask? Whats the big deal? Is it uncomfortable? yes, sometime. Is it annoying? yes. Is it another thing that you have to remember when you are going out the front door? No doubt about it. Does it take a little more preparation when you go out? yes. I have a mask in my car, I have a mask in my pocket so when I go out, I am prepared. So I don’t make much of a big deal about it. I am not making a political statement of any kind. I am just saying “You know what, if there is anything I could do to reduce the chance that I could give you the covid-19, I am willing to take this one for the team. ”I am willing to do it to reduce the chance.” Of course, I don’t like the way I look when I wear a mask in public.I don’t like having to remember to put it on. I don’t like to remember to take it off.So I am gonna do my part. I am gonna wear a mask, but people who don’t believe in wearing a mask don’t care about other people get infected. First of all, have you been tested? Do you know if you are infected? do you know if you are spreading the virus around when you go out there without a mask? Well you don’t unless you get tested everyday.Almost all scientists and experts who have a PHD degree and have spent decades in this field, they all recommend wearing a mask, so I am not sure what your credentials that make you think you know more than them."
"Thank you. I am aware how face masks (supposedly) work. I live in a location where they have been compulsory everywhere in public, so there have been quite a debate on the subject and I have a lot of experience wearing them. I also recall several highly-ranked medical professionals in Czechia speaking about their compulsory use.I'm happy to conclude that after few months, people grew tired of them, eventually stopped wearing them anywhere where their use isn't enforced and the anti-mask sentiment in the society is now significant (even among those who were very euthusiastic about them in the beginning). I expect this will happen in the rest of Europe too, as the time progreses (we had compulsory masks very early on, so we're slightly ahead with annoyance :)). But to get back on the topic of Iceland: There are no face masks rules in Iceland. Wearing masks on a plane can make sense when travelling to a place where they're required. It doesn't make sense on a way to a mask-free place."
"""Wearing masks on a plane can make sense when travelling to a place where they're required."" No. Wearing masks on a plane makes sense when you are coming _from_ a place where the virus is circulating. It makes total sense to wear a mask on a plane where you are confined with several hundred people who have a risk to be infected (indluding you, as very well explained). The virus circulation in Iceland is currently very low. People upon arrival will be tested and only those who are not carrying the virus will be allowed into the country. So most people which you encounter when you are actually allowed in have a very low risk of carrying the virus. Again, definitely not the case on the plane. See this : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/0… . Almost one out of 8 passengers tested positive.I'm actually interested to see what will be the results of the first days of testing, I hope Iceland authorities will communicate about that (and I'm sincerely hoping they will be lower than the incident reported above)."
"The810,The reason people stopped wearing them in Slovakia is probably because you only have around 1500 cases and 28 deaths. You're basing everything on your own personal experience in your own small country rather than taking other factors into account."
I am afraid there is bad news.Iceland have decided not to accept test results from tourists' home countryYou have to test on arrival in Iceland and go into isolation there if you test positive. so it is a risk. maybe you fly there for nothing but 14 days compulsory isolation
drr49--I agree 100%.
"#126, that was posted already. That makes sense as there would be no way to verify a test result was real vs a nicely forged fake piece of paper.If our trip works out in August, I plan to try to get a test here in the US a day or two before I leave. If it's positive then I can cancel my trip and not find out after I've committed."
Potentially bad news for anyone from the US hoping to go to Iceland in July (the last four paragraphs or so are the most relevant): https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/EU-…

"@drr49 - oh, sorry about that! The SF link worked for me in my standard incognito mode, so I didn't think about that. Thanks for the better link!"
"There were questions about what happens if someone else on your plane tests positive.This is what the Icelandic COVID-19 page says, so the two seat-row radius seems to be important:A negative test result does not guarantee that an individual will not later be required to self-quarantine if they have been exposed to infection, e.g. on the flight to Iceland.The contact tracing team interviews those who have been in close contact with a confirmed active case during two days prior to the onset of symptoms , e.g. been within 2 meters of an individual for more than 15 minutes, or those who have sat close to an infected individual on an airplane (usually within two seat-row radius). They might be required to self-quarantine for two weeks from the time of last contact. https:/…tourists-travelling-to-iceland"
"Well, that puts me off going in the next couple of months at least. Having to quarantine for two weeks due to someone else being positive would be so annoying. Oh well there's always next year I guess."
"I thought it had been announced that with the airline requiring passengers to wear a mask that it would eliminate the requirement of individuals near them on the plane to quarantine? Based on this article, though I suppose the language isn't very definitive.https:/…"
"Yeah, too many different reports and changing all the time it seems. Difficult to plan."
Agreed. Nothing too concrete is known in case of a positive passenger. Lets see how it goes for first few weeks.
