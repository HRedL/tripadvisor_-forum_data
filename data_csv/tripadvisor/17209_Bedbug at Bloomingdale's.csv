"It's becoming clearer that there is absolutely nothing (at this point) that anyone can do to avoid coming in contact with these little critters. Suggest everyone concentrate on efforts to prevent bringing them into your homes.The report says they found only one bedbug at Bloomie's, but that's like saying you only saw one roach in a kitchen -- for every one you see, there are hundreds lurking out of sight."
I think they are just focusing on bedbugs right now but i think they have been lurking for a long time .It is not the stores fault it is people not checking to see if they are on them.Everyone just should be aware of them and check there rooms no hotel is excluded from a one star to a five star hotel
Quick-- shut all the borders-- we must fight this epidemic. This one is not a concern though-- It was planted by someone who works for Macy's
"Iris, have you ever accounted bedbugs? It's not as if they make themselves known as soon as you get through the door....and that's exactly why they're so difficult to get rid of and so easy to spread.....We'll survive, I'm sure..."
I was just trying to state that it is not the department stores fault they have bedbugs Meyem.This is just the thing that the media is trying to do to scare people next week it will be some thing else.
