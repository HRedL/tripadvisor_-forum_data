HiWe are travelling to spain for the 2nd time in april. We would like to know how safe is it from the outbreak of coronavirus or is it just a media hype?
"That would depend on where you are planning to go in Spain. I am planning travel to Barcelona in Mid-March and have been researching this question. There are currently two ""hotspots"" where ""patient zero"" (a person from whom others that have tested positive was the likely source of contagion). Vitoria in Basque country (northwest Spain) and Torrejón de Ardoz (a suburb of Madrid). Traveling to these areas might soon be a much higher risk. This clearly is NOT media hype! However, it is a bit early to make a decision on your trip in April. You should re-ask the question about three weeks before your planned arrival in Spain. LOTS can change in a month."
"No one knows, just as no one knows whether and how far/how fast it will spread where you live. You need to watch for Government advisories and not base your decision on media hype. Remember, if a second person is diagnosed in a particular country, “two people have Coronavirus in X country” isn’t a headline; “numbers of people diagnosed has doubled in the last week” certainly is. Same story but the second sounds more dramatic."
"There have been 151 cases of the virus in Spain. Only one man who was 69 years old died and he had been in Nepal. Most of the other cases were of people who had contracted the disease when they traveled to Northern Italy. Spanish health authorities are investigating all cases.A friend from the US sent me this article: A DOCTOR ADVISES DOCTORS RE THE CORONAVIRUS:""Date: February 26, 2020 at 2:35:50 PM ESTSubject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemicDear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!James Robb, MD FCAP"

"I'm here now in Valencia, landed two days ago, its like the rest of the world, same virus, different country. Whatever you do in the country you're in, do here. Nothing to worry about. Out of the 80,000 cases in China, 40,000 have so far recovered. The news will tell you ALL of the deaths but not the people who survived. Keep clean, keep away from hysteria and you'll be perfectly fine. :)"
Does Spain have any travel restrictions on any other countries?
"As previously said, the situation is changing on a daily basis world over and just because a place has fewer confirmed cases today, does not mean that next week there won’t be a surge in confirmed cases. If you still wish to travel, then take the precautions suggested by healthcare professionals - keep washing hands, carry anti bac hand gel etc. If you must wear a face mask, wear it properly and not like some sort of fashion accessory! If however, you are one of the worried well and are getting anxious, then stay home and re-arrange your travel plans for another time."
This Spanish news channel is updated every couple of hours with the figures across Spain if anyone is interested. https:/…2004681.shtml
I agree with LivvyMad.
"""If you must wear a face mask, wear it properly and not like some sort of fashion accessory""Although normal face masks are absolutely useless in preventing you catching the virus. Only wear one if you already have the virus, and are trying not to spread the disease (and why are you out in any case?), or if you want to look like a total idiot!Edited: 7:03 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"We are also going in April and have found the following links very helpful to track what's going on. The first one is an Advisory being published regularly by the Spain Abroad program at St Louis University. https:/…coronavirus-update.phpThe second is a Wikipedia page dedicated to the Coronavirus in Spain. It has daily updates on where new infections are popping up, and a host of other stuff. https:/…2020_coronavirus_outbreak_in_Spain"
"""Just wait till virus spreads in your area and someone near you sniff and cough and accidentally spraying in your direction, what would you do then??If I am over 7 feet away, I don't need to do anything. And a common or garden mask that you see people wearing won't stop you catchingt the virus. Just because people are wearing the masks does not mean they are of any use - I am merely pointing out that the experts in the field clearly state that masks are only of use if you have the virus, and mitigate the chances of onward transmission."
"I have taken 4 flights within the past 8 days and my comment about not wearing face masks like fashion accessories was based on what I saw. People are just not wearing them correctly. I have recently witnessed:1) People walking around the airport or cabin with the masks hanging around their necks, lifting them periodically to cover their mouths having touched various surfaces without washing hands or using sanitiser gel 2) Wearing masks on board aircraft only, when you are just as likely to be infected at the airport where there are even more people 3) Asian females taking selfies of themselves wearing masks combined with cat or bunny ear type headbands! 4) People in airport toilets wearing masks but not stopping to wash hands after using the toilet - failing in even the most basic hygiene 5) People wearing masks on their heads and then lowering to cover mouth at certain timesMy point is, if you are going to wear a mask then wear it properly, otherwise it offers absolutely no protection and can even put you at greater risk. Personally, I did not wear a mask but I did wash my hands frequently and thoroughly and used hand sanitiser during the flight."
"How many cases there are in any particular country isn't the issue. The virus is now an issue everywhere, and is becoming steadily more serious. Decisions on whether or not to travel must be based on your personal risk factors, not on the opinions of strangers on a travel forum. The insouciance of people who offer reassurance of the ""It's no worse than flu"" and ""Don't believe the scaremongering tabloids"" kind is astonishing.For many people who contract the virus, it may be no worse than flu. For older people, and for anyone with existing health issues (i.e. respiratory problems, and diabetes) it is far more likely than flu to be a very serious illness, or fatal.If you are in this category, or even if you are young and healthy and don't mind the now considerable risk of getting ill, then don't worry and enjoy your travels. However, it surely makes sense, if you don't have to travel right now, to take the sensible precaution of keeping clear of crowds, such as in airports; and places where every surface you touch has been touched by dozens of people, such as aircraft (that's the easiest way to catch a cold at the best of times, even when no pandemic threatens). On the whole, the risk of contracting the virus is more in the time spent in such crowded places, than in the number of cases in the city or country you plan to visit.Edited: 4:20 am, March 08, 2020 "
"As others have pointed out, every potential traveller has to measure the risks (as outlined by medical experts) and decide for themselves. We're booked for a trip in April as well, so are following Spain's stats closely. As of last week, verified cases have begun to increase by about 100 a day. This virus is highly contagious, and things will likely get worse than better. The bottom line is most people don't die from the virus. However, it can be a major inconvenience and expense to be quarantined for several weeks -- on vacation -- in another country. As well, I can't imagine hotels will welcome infected travellers with open arms. In some airports, travellers' temps are being taken if they have come from a heavily infected area, before they are allowed to enter the country. The situation is still unfolding of course, but these are some of the things we are keeping in mind before making a decision to travel to this part of Europe."
The latest figures for Spain by community are here as of 14.30h today.https:/…2004681.shtml
iam traveling to Madrid this weekend. my hotel is in the center . how safe it is ??? from corona virus ?
Look at the link in post #19 for up to date info.
"The authorities are taking this seriously and the following has just hit the press:“The Community of Madrid has ordered this Monday the closure of all educational centers, from children to universities, before the advance of the coronavirus.The Government of the Community of Madrid has decreed the suspension of all educational activity as of Wednesday, March 11 to prevent the expansion of the coronavirus in the region, which concentrates half of the infections in Spain (577) and where there are 16 deaths, Efe sources have confirmed to the Executive.This measure, taken during this Monday during the celebration of an extraordinary Governing Council , affects schools, institutes, universities and business centers, among others.”"
"I think the key point to traveling or not may not even be ""catching corona virus"" - it's in getting caught up in a closure of a city, region, hotel, loss of transport, border/airport/trains shut down, etc. and then everything you came to see being closed/not happening.i.e. - what are they saying in spain about Semana Santa?It's not that you'll get it (though you could) - it's that you'll be marooned for 14 days somewhere when the government mandates a closure/lockdown/quarantine. Ugh. so disappointed. really want to go."
DCI agree with you. We have postponed our trip to France for the exact reasons you have mentioned.
WHO just declared coronavirus as a pandemic.
My cousin that lives in Spain sent me a text to advise me things are very chaotic in Madrid. Unfortunately I used Tripmasters and Air Europa and they don’t want to cancel nothing. I still cancelled everything .
"Well I live in central Madrid and would not describe things as chaotic! Supermarkets are busy if that what your cousin describes as chaotic! Alarmist comments at a time like this are not helpful, and are, quite frankly, irresponsible.Edited: 5:15 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Livvy, I read the museums are closed. Can you confirm if that is true and did they say how long they would be closed for?"
Brad: The situation is changing on a daily basis but this is the latest news you are referring to. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…
"Thanks Livvy. Yes, that is what I was referring to. Just figured I would confirm with someone who is there and not rely on everything from the media :)Thank you again."
"Brad: It is unfortunate but true, no doubt more announcements to follow affecting other tourist sites. I noticed that the streets in my neighbourhood where quieter than normal today, still many people going about their business, but a definite decrease in the volume of people.Edited: 6:39 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"I'm wondering why the US government isn't taking similar precautions, given that incidences of CV are vastly under reported in the US due to the unavailability of test kits."
I love Spain but right now 1000 plus cases in Madrid and my cousin wants me to come again but wanted to warn me. The governor of Florida put a new policy that if you come in contact with Coronavirus Or from a country with High frequency must quarantine for 14 days. It’s not rumors it’s a pandemic and the truth.
No travel to Europe as per Trump .
"I’m British and Trump is allowing flights from U.K., but I won’t say what the majority of Europeans think of this moron."
"DRman: Your initial post stated that your cousin said it was ‘chaotic’ in Madrid, it said nothing about Trump, or quarantine. Nobody is disputing the fact that this has now become a pandemic. I am, however, correcting the misleading impression you gave in your initial post that things are chaotic in Madrid ........ the simple fact is that they are not. Yes, people are stocking up on food items and supermarkets are busy, yes schools and museums are closed, but there is no evidence of chaos!"
"Can Madrid residents give some idea whether tourists have stopped, or has the city slowed down, or any other obvious and visible changes? We have a plan to visit mid April, and would like to adapt our plans suitably."
"Vasu: Museums such as the Prado are now closed until further notice. I guess that in the coming days more restrictions and closures will be imposed. Life goes on, but I did notice that there seemed to be fewer people than usual out and about on the streets of my neighbourhood yesterday. That is not to say the streets are deserted, they are not, just not the normal volume of footfall."

"I will travel to Barcelona, Valencia and Madrid on Saturday via train (Interrail)But to be honest, I am not sure if its a good idea to attend this trip.We reserved all the trains and if a single one is cancelled, we have a problem.Does anyone know how the Coronavirus affects - Trains- Museums- Restaurants and Barsin the Cities I mentioned?"
Look at previous posts on this forum which contain information on the current situation in Madrid. Take a look at the forums for the other cities mentioned for similar information.
Just play it safe and take the financial hit. Madrid has so many virus cases and a significant number of deaths.
Tell me how safe travelling is to cordoba Spain on the 28th of March
How safe is it to travel to Cordoba Spain on the 28th March
"As safe as anywhere else in the world, but not very safe on the 29th.Edited: 7:51 pm, March 12, 2020 "
How much of the Covid-19 virus is there in Castel de campo
Nobody knows Britain has 800 confirmed cases but the chief medical officer reckons it’s probably more like 5000/10000
"""Nobody knows Britain has 800 confirmed cases but the chief medical officer reckons it’s probably more like 5000/10000""Very true - unlike the US which is testing virtually no one, as you have to pay to be tested."
"None of the statistics can be correct, especially as most places now not testing even people with symptoms."
"Hola- Spain is completely shut down. Even Easter celebrations in Sevilla are now canceled. Don't travel, stay home! Patience and soon life will go back to 'normal'. 14-3-2020. Gracias"
"According to the draft decree for the state of alarm, people in Spain would only be able to move around if they need to go to work, buy foodstuffs or purchase pharmaceuticals.https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-03-1…"
This is all so depressing. Was looking forward to visit Madrid and and other places in Spain this year too. Wonder if things would reach some semblance of normalcy anytime soon seeing the way things are going as of now.
"Rajkk: The only thing any of us can do is to stay calm, follow the advice and sit this one out. Who knows how long it will take, but this situation will eventually pass. You will get to visit Spain at some point for sure, it will still be here, and your visit will be welcomed when the time is right."
@54 - this is exactly right. And same goes for anywhere in the world right now. Time is always the healer.
"@ LivvyMad,Hoping for the best!Thanks.Edited: 8:04 am, March 17, 2020 "
"We cancelled our travel to Spain and a few other places in Europe, based on the reality of the situation.Maybe it is just as well, for the world to take a step back, and realize what is the most important thing in our lives. For many, it is a nature given opportunity to spend quality time with the loved ones at home."
Thank you for your thoughtful words and all the best.
"Government orders “the suspension of opening to the public of all hotels and similar lodgings, tourist accommodation and other short-term accommodation situated on Spain”"
