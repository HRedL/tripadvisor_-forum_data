"Tour maybe the forum can help. I am scheduled to fly to STT (will probably postpone) on April 23rd as well. I have no notifications from Delta regarding cancellations and cannot find any announcements after an extensive search. Their website is still letting you book flights for those dates if you wish. I did not call due to my flights being almost a month out. No worries - I’ll just wait it out.Edited: 10:46 pm, March 27, 2020 "

Thats funny I don’t see it on Delta site either or on the web but it was in the governors press conference and you can’t book a flight today-tue so I’m sure they are lagging on cancelling it online.
Thank you Kit Kat and thank you Tour.
"I’m also waiting out canceling my delta flights for late April, but if I log into my reservation, the flights themselves still appear uncancelled...well, just noticed, my direct to nyc *return* flight (a couple days after 4/24) must’ve been canceled as now we appear to be on a flight with an ATL connection. ...did not however receive any itinerary update emails from delta (only many covid policy update ones!), which is interesting. I’m used to getting change notifications when an arrival time changes by 2 minutes, but nothing for an entire itinerary change? Ha. So, the waiting game continues !"
"AMS - same thing with me. My April 18th flight down on American was cancelled, but my Delta return is still ""on"" for April 25th but the times are weird and it even appears that i travel back in time as I now leave the 26th and return home the 25th with like 4 stops. I'm assuming there is more to come from Delta - as of now they won't even entertain any discussions unless you're traveling within 3 days. What's super frustrating is I want to use these credits for a future booking. Madness"
"What I meant is, my flight down is pre 4/24. If I start a new search , it doesn’t show up (of course, because it doesn’t exist anymore). But if I log in and access my personal itinerary, it still says that it is scheduled and on time.I know that it is canceled and I am entitled to my money back and will reach out and make that happen if they don’t automatically. I’m just amused that if I open my delta account it’s *still* counting down the days until I can check in online."
Call them now. I called AA and put in for a refund. They told me I was eligible but until I get my $$ won't be 100% sure. I did not have to wait on the phone. I would not rely on email as they are very behind and if you call and ask for the refund they won't automatically give you a voucher.
"I had flights on AA to a different destination this week. If u wait until AA cancels you can get your $ back, if you cancel first, you get a voucher. AA canceled my flight 2 days before the flight - I wasn’t taking the trip but knew to wait it out. Things might be different on Delta."
"My flight with AA was on May 2nd but the rep told me that since my flight changed 3X and by more than one hour I was eligible for a refund. But, generally I agree. Wait util they cancel then ask for the refund."
"Update: *finally* on Sunday when I opened my delta account instead of saying “12 days til check in!” it now said I had no upcoming trips. Later that evening I received an email from Delta informing me that my flights were canceled and that they were automatically processing an E-Credit.I did ultimately decide to call for an actual refund for a handful of reasons, and despite testing my patience with their crackly hold music, they were pleasant and the process was extremely easy. Once I got through to a representative, they were willing and helpful — though Delta certainly made sure I *really* wanted that refund — no automated call back and looking at my call log I was on hold for approximately 56 minutes. (I did consider giving up and accepting my credit, but then again— what else do I have to do these days ? ;) )"
