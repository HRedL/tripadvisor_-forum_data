"I'm visiting Mykonos during the beginning of April, in 4 weeks. Does anyone have any recommendations on what clothing to pack? Based on the weather, 'dress code' etc. Too cold for shorts? Too warm for jeans? Thanks!"
Thank you!
"cold in april, but attention at covid-19"
"I really don't think you'll be going to Mykonos in April, as all tourist accommodation is closed & very few shops , tavernas etc open because of COVID 19. If you could get here, which is not very likely, you would have to spend 2 weeks in isolation. Do a bit of internet research & then, in my opinion, you should cancel!"
