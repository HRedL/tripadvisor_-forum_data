"Rio Park is closing tomorrow. Flash and the Servigroup hotels have delayed opening. Jet2 are repatriating - we've been told we're going home early but don't know when yet. Atmosphere flat, as you can imagine."
"Well at least you there so enjoy what time you have left and enjoy the sun. My mates went to airport on Sunday but were told there was no guarantee they would be able to get back so got a taxi home such a shame for them when all packed and ready to go. Also the 14 day rule was in the back of their minds as well. Think the government needs a long term strategy not 3 weeks having to isolate, 3 weeks not isolating then back to isolation again. Holiday makers now to all destinations should just assume they will have to isolate on return and if they do not it is a bonus. They need to factor it in as things could change at any moment of time. Yesterday was sitting in the beer garden in the pouring rain instead of being in Spain so hope you get some sunny days in Benidorm.Edited: 4:35 am, July 28, 2020 "
"you will get even flater replies on here by the doom and gloom merchants, who take pleasure in it."
"Enjoy the sunshine, and safe journey home X..........We were due to fly to Alicante tomorrow, but very reluctantly decided to stay at home.We hope to get to Benidorm later in the year X"
Thank you
The Benidorm buzz went away long ago. Just been wandering around the Rincon area and was quite surprised how many people and traffic were about (not a policeman anywhere) The percentage of people wearing masks is falling fast. Last week around 90% and today only around 60%. Whole families without masks!!Loads of Benidorm tat shops open and more bars and restaurants still opening daily but most waiting until early evening to open. Reliable Marianos open 24 hours now.I noticed young Deborah filming around the 4 kings area which suits as it was very busy in there (highly recommended place to eat) Still loads of areas closed up and unlikely to open soon.Steve
"#5 Steve what is your take on the falling numbers of people wearing masks? More tourist and numbers have increased, so the % of none compliance appears to be more? or?."
"J&S....More brits arriving daily...for now anyway and it's mainly brit holidaymakers that defy the rules. And before I get accused of ""blaming the brits"" I can tell it's Brita by various ways. Before the holidaymakers were allowed to travel to Spain the mask wearing % was extremely high around 90% and now the 'locals' are being diluted the % is dropping!!And yes the Tropical bar is up and running with entertainment but doesn't open until later in the day.Edited: 8:10 am, July 28, 2020 "
Thanks Steve
"just reminds me when we had foot and mouth on our farm, people were still walking on our land, some people will just not listen and take it in we had 9 weeks in quarantin then"
#9 wasnt it the same Mr Ferguson (SAGE) who was part of the team that recommended the slaughter of 12 million animals during the FAM?.Correct me if i am wrong were the actual figures later produced showing 88% of all the animals were infection free?
just the same has covid19
So sorry this has happened while you are there. Try & enjoy your time that you have left there. Look after yourselves. x
"I’ve been there and back now, just wish people were honest on here instead telling people liesEdited: 5:49 pm, July 28, 2020 "
What lies? Is the quarantine lies? The fact that the Rio Park is closing lies? That many places are not opening now lies? What do you mean poster 13? Give us the benefit of your experience.Jules

Mask wearing on the streets is compulsory and there were police everywhere to enforce itSo the post about a low% of wearers seems a strange one just saying
"Masks don't stop spreading viruses, actually, tjere is a good chance and some evidence they help spreading it apart from deteriorating lings and immunity if wearing regularlly.Masks are also doing another planned thing, they strip us humans from individuality, by reducing our communication and are simple phisical bariers that helps is isolate oirselves even futher after over decade of social media.It is all antihuman."
"At #18 it just happens, mask use whether or not anyone agrees its a local rule in the valencian communuity of which benidorm is part of.You know, benidorm! That place you have never been to or plan to Visit either, ever! It Just has a popular forum to peddle your s***e."
11 million a year can’t be wrong
"I have never been there, fact and i'm not planning to go either.You got it.Anti human and questionable science rules are tools of tyrrany."
"@ #16...I hope that you are not referring to my post where I said that a lower % were wearing masks??You have only been here for a few days holiday whereas I see people in Benidorm every day. When it was just locals out and about ( before holidaymakers were allowed back) there was a very high percentage wearing masks, 90%, when Benidorm locals population was diluted with holidaymakers the percentage dropped dramatically to around 60% !! Especially in the Rincon area around the Silver Dollar and Piccadilly bars. Nearly everyone who was not wearing masks were brits. It's up to you poster #16 If you think I'm exaggerating (or lying) but don't start winging and moaning when the next lockdown comes and you loose your holiday.Do the right thing.....Steve"
"Hi Binsteve, as I said in another post, just ignore him. he might go away. He don't live in the real word. It a bad time for Spain in the whole. I only hope we can all return some time in the future.regards Mark"

"never mind brit;s in beni, just take alook back home"
"Maybe these selfish idiots who broke the social distancing rules with there riots and protests and street party's might act differently if a 3nd waive hits us .These rules are set in place to protect us ......now look at us , it was on the cards ."
"Pureacielo, you might be better using Qanon as a vehicle for your nonsense mate. The poster has had his holiday cut short and probably dosent want to hear your rambling’s. Just a thought."
"Puracielo, if you have no plans to ever go to Benidorm then can I ask why you are posting on here then? May I suggest a forum of a place that you DO intend to go to?You are trying to force your opinions of masks etc onto other people, as adults I'm sure we can make that choice for ourselves.The upshot is, Benidorm has rules of wearing a mask 99% of the time, anyone who doesn't want to abide by these rules isn't forced to holiday there. Simple really!"
"Puracielio. Please go and post your thoughts and theories on the forums wherever you have an interest in travelling to. Your views do not appear to be respected at all or wanted on this forum. You have told us that you would never travel to Benidorm, so please stop spamming all the Benidorm forum topics. Please use other forums to post your view, they might be happy to listen."
"Stop talking s**** I was there and your wrong,Couldn’t care lesss"
"Just seen a video from my friend living there now that she took last night. 5 minutes of the strip/square and a lot of people without masks at all, the usual drunken fighting and falling over sadly but the club was definitely no masks in sight.Presumably the video is also lying......"
Thank you Paul Newcastle for your post regarding masks being worn. Flouting the law on masks and social distancing will only make the situation worse. Steve
Feature from that august political journal The Sunhttps:/…
I also have a friend who lives out there and totally agree with what Tebo statement.He has basically said the nearer you get to the strip the less people are wearing face masks.
"The keyboard government control warriors would if capable have a really good argument with the Spanish police, but very quickly lose"
Tebo its actually very worrying seeing the videos of very busy bars all dancing without a care in the world.I suppose the fact you witness them during the day tells us the level of stupidity isnt likely to change while drunk sadly
"Can people stop posting B S on here just to get a reaction I’m back from Benidorm and all rules with masks social distancing was enforced EVERYWHERE except your bedEdited: 11:40 am, July 29, 2020 "
Paul Newcastle.Where's the video let's have a look.
Strange that my posts about the appropriate use of masks have been deleted especially at the time.Steve
Boring? Everyone gets it
Where is the video? Dont you think if it was available to share online i would have done so already to shut up the person crying over honest facts? In sure if you are in any facebook groups for Benidorm there will be evidence there too(like there is in Tenerife groups i use)
