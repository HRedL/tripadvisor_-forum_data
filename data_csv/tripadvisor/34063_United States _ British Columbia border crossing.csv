"If you are healthy and must cross the border for work or other essential (non-discretionary) purposes, you may continue to do so. Some examples of essential travel purposes are:work and studycritical infrastructure supporteconomic services and supply chainsshopping for essential goods, such as:medicationitems necessary for the health and safety of an individual or familyhealth, immediate medical care, safety and securitySome persons working in the health care field are considered exempt from the border prohibition. This is the case as long as they do not provide direct care for people over 65 years of age within the first 14 days of their entry into Canada.The above is from the link in post #3. Unless the border is open for non essential travel by summer, I highly doubt that you would qualify. Even if you own a home in Vancouver. Please plan on staying home."
"The border to Canada is closed to travel for tourism, recreation and entertainment until at least May 21st, 2020. That date has been extended already for 30 days from April 21st, so it is possible it will be extended again.Canadians can return to their home country with a mandatory quarantine of 14 days upon arrival.Our virus numbers are not nearly at the stage where officials think the disease is at a manageable level for moving about and the virus numbers in the US are definitely not low enough to be acceptable for moving around.Foreign nationals arriving from the U.S. without symptoms of COVID-19, will be allowed to enter Canada only for essential travel. Essential travel includes: - work and study- critical infrastructure support- economic services and supply chains- shopping for essential goods, such as: medication, items necessary for the health and safety of an individual or family- health, immediate medical care, safety and security"
Canadians in neighbouring Provinces aren’t able to go to their vacation homes in BC.The answer is NO !!!!
"I don't know when you are calling ""this summer"" is but today defininitely aint summer and most wouldn't consider it before May 21 (the current planned date the closure expires) so I think you can safely ignore all these responses and check again after May 21.Edited: 5:49 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"The CBSA website is dated March 20, 2020 and is now out of date. The effective date (March 21-April 21) was extended last week for a further 30 days to June 21. The link in post 3, bottom section of the page, has the info that is in effect."
"Last time I checked, 30 days from April 21 falls around May 21st, not in June. ;-)"
While not relevant to this discussion exactly.New Brunswick announced today that they will start opening up their businesses etc.What they also said is that the border control points will stay in place till a vaccine is available.If other provinces follow suit then it looks like the border will be closed for quite some time.Who knows how they will control entry and what guidelines they will use?
"I seem to have done word switches a fair bit lately, krp. Sometimes I catch it, sometimes I don't. Good thing I wrote post 6 first!"
"I am a Canadian living in the US with my US husband and dual citizenship kids. My whole family is in Vancouver, including my elderly parents. I am concerned about not being able to see them. Given that the current situation continues, any idea if we as Canadians (my kids and I) would be able to cross the border? We would plan to quarantine at my sister’s house for 14 days upon arrival, assuming good health."
"Karyn ~This link has information about travellers coming to be with immediate family members:https:/…travel-restrictions-exemptions.htmlThis link is a repeat of the link in post 3. It contains much information about Canadians coming (returning) to Canada. https:/…fRead through the articles and feel free to post further specific questions if you need to.As a dual citizen, you will need a passport for Canada. Canadians are required to have a Canadian passport to enter Canada now. This link discusses dual citizenship:https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugee…"
"Karyn, that's a hard one. I don't think any volunteers on here can truly answer that one. Do the kids have a Canadian passport at all? And assuming you could even get a flight, would you want to risk getting on a plane right now, especially with the kids? We are all struggling, all over the world, wanting to see our families. My daughter is in Vancouver, and she won't come home. She is so worried that she may be asymtomatic, and won't come near us. Our grandkids are ten minutes down the road, and we can't see them either. Thank goodness for Skype and facetime! I can at least read stories to my grandson that way."
"Even though you and your children are Canadian, you do not reside here in Canada, so coming back to Canada would not be ""repatriation"", which is being allowed. Unless there is a family crisis (i.e. someone on their death bed), visiting family members is leisure/recreational travel ... non-essential travel. Even those of us living in Canada cannot visit our loved ones in Canada, since we are supposed to be avoiding all non-essential travel. Even between some provinces, crossing the provincial boundary into the neighbouring province requires self-isolation for 14 days, and in some cases, provinces are not allowing entry to anyone other than residents and people involved in essential services.I share your concerns about not being able to visit family. I am not able to visit my kids and grandchildren, who live four hours away and in another province (although the location makes no difference in this case; other than a ban on non-essential travel in general, there are no barriers or requirement for quarantine between Alberta and BC ... if I weren't taking this seriously, I could ""sneak"" in a visit). We recently had a major family milestone, but were unable to celebrate together because of the pandemic. Then, earlier this week, my elderly brother-in-law in Manitoba had a stroke and will be in hospital and then in a rehab hospital for many weeks. Unless she is willing to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Manitoba, his daughter, who lives in Saskatchewan, cannot travel to Manitoba to be with her mother (who cannot visit her husband in the hospital).We are all having to make sacrifices and forego visits in person with those whom we love. I would recommend you use the same means that the rest of us Canadians are using to be distant yet remain close to loved ones ... phone calls, skype, facetime, messenger video chats, zoom etc.One other thing to consider - quarantining means you have no contact with anyone, other than someone dropping off meals or supplies at a distance of at least two metres. You cannot share living space with people who are not in quarantine. So unless your sister has a separate area in her home where you can be closed off from the rest of the family, quarantining at your sister's house would either require her and her family to be in quarantine with you, or for them to vacate the house while you quarantine there. As to your question about how long the border will stay closed, personally, I think it is going to be many months before the Canada/US border is open for leisure travel. It may be some months before there is even domestic travel. In post #12 above, it says that the NB government won't be opening their border (presumably with the US, not other provinces) until there is a vaccine ... I have read the NB press release, but have not been able to find any information to confirm that. If Harcon has a source for that information, I would very much like to read it, since I have elderly family in NB and have flights booked to go there late in July.Edited: 12:32 am, April 25, 2020 "
"@krpIt was widely reported yesterday.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick…Higgs said that they might consider opening up between PEI and NB but that would only happen in the last phase...possibly 6-8 weeks from now.Higgs also hinted at the possibility of restricting travel out of NB as well.Under the recovery plan, Higgs said the province will still have to keep borders closed, and he suggested it may even further restrict movement at the border.Close contact things like dentists etc. are not even in the first phase.All this is assuming that things go well and cases do not increase.This is from a province that has had no new cases in the last 6 days, I live in Quebec so they are not going to want to see us...:-(We were flying into Moncton and driving to PEI early July...Not entirely giving up hope yet but don't think this will happen."
"@harcon Thank you for the link. I had already read that CBC story, as well as the government press release. My question is specifically in regard to this comment in your post above: ""What they also said is that the border control points will stay in place till a vaccine is available."" Thanking you in advance ... any links you can share on this point are appreciated"
"@krphttps:/…Unfortunately, I cannot find this in English.You will see on the chart the last phase, which Higgs has said includes the border and sporting events etc. is likely only going to happen, if and when there is a vaccine or if there is another way to control outbreaks.Higgs also said in an interview on Power and Politics(can't find link) that they are looking at possibly opening border with PEI earlier since they are not affected by Covid as much as other provinces.PEI health minister said that it is too early to talk about easing restrictions at the border. Tourism, as you know I am sure, is a big part of PEI economy and I am sure there is pressure to open things up this summer.This is all as of yesterday, could be that things change dramatically for the better soon, all across Canada but I am becoming less hopeful."
You can find the P&P interview with Higgs at the 46:15 point of this clip:https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1729429059636
"@phpr and @harcon Thank you for that link and especially the detailed info about what part to watch, phpr, and thank you, harcon, for the article with the charts. Although I speak French very poorly, I have no trouble reading it. :)I looked for the chart showing the four phases of reopening in NB in English on the NB provincial government website and couldn't find it, but a google image search found an English version on the NB Green Party facebook page, so for anyone who wants to read it in English, here is the link: https:/…3164562226895854I find that bit about the border really, really interesting. In regard to the provincial border between NB and PEI, @harcon, you and I both have selfish reasons for hoping it will indeed be possible to travel to those provinces, since we both have trips planned for July. The phased in reopening plan gives me a little hope although that is also tempered by the risks of travelling across the country, especially because I am going there to visit relatives who are 87, 90 and 93, along with many others in my age group (50s/60s). In regard to the Canada/US border, the suggestion from NB that the Canada/US border won't be wide open until there is a vaccine is interesting, because as far as I know, the international border is not actually an area where the provinces have jurisdiction. So by NB stating that is their plan, it makes me wonder if there has already been discussion between the federal and provincial governments, that this may be the general idea for the Canada/US border in general.Edited: 8:06 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"What I heard in the video, and I could be wrong, was that in the 4th phase, the Green phase, large scale gatherings such as festivals and bar opening hours ""may not happen until a vaccine is found."" (46:49)Then at 50:00, ""opening up some freedoms within our own province, recognising the borders stay as is.""I took that as within the province, the opening of the economy would unfold in four phases but the border would stay as the rules are now. The four phases sound like a plan but the borders staying as is does not make sense, not as a firm decision. The border restrictions with Maine, Québec and Nova Scotia seems to me to be determined by the number of Covid cases in all four jurisdictions and those numbers could change.What does it say about travelling to NB? Unless the current rules remain in place for a number of months, it is not clear."
"Provinces seem to be making up the rules as they go along.BC, Ontario and a couple of other provinces do not currently have inter-provincial travel restrictions.Here in Quebec you cannot travel to certain regions within the province other than for essential travel.We certainly are living in interesting times:-(It would be interesting if someone was to challenge these restrictions, as under the Charter of rights and freedoms we are allowed to travel and work throughout Canada without restrictions.We have up until June 20th to cancel our rental in PEI. So, not cancelling yet.Things can change, hopefully! We can change our flights to Charlottetown instead of Moncton so, for us it really depends on PEI not NB.If the border was to open up between US/CAN border on May 20th then I would assume all inter provincial travel would be open..Again, not likely though."
It’s not just a matter of when then borders will open but at what conditions will they open. Right now there is a 14 day mandatory quarantine that could continue to apply well after the reopening of the borders.
"@kollision..valid point!Wishful thinking that if they allow travel between provinces it would be without quarantine. Although, would not be much point to allow travel and continue the 14 day quarantine."
">> Here in Quebec you cannot travel to certain regions within the province other than for essential travel.It's not just in Quebec - all over Canada, nobody is supposed to be travelling anywhere, other than for essential reasons. I've heard and read news stories from every part of the country, urging Canadians NOT to go to their summer cottages, for example. (Yet apparently that doesn't apply to our prime minister :-( , so is it any wonder that many are not listening?) Here, in the Canadian Rockies national parks, the parks are closed to all visitors, but they cannot actually barricade off the parks, because we have major highways running through. Yet there are still a number of tourists coming to visit. The town of Banff (which, according to CBC news reports, has an 85% unemployment rate right now) put up informational check-stops on the Easter long weekend, to try and dissuade day visitors from Calgary and area. That's not an issue here, because the town of Jasper is too far away from a city to be an easy day trip, but the town is putting up a sign on the main entry to town, to inform Albertans coming to stay here that they should not be visiting now. Hotels are still allowed to be operating (as an essential service); many are closed and some are only accepting essential workers and contractors (there is ongoing work on the TMX pipeline expansion project and also the largest campground here in Jasper National Park, among other projects), but some hotels are obviously still accepting visitors."
Non-essential for the Opposition leader to jam his family on to a small plane with non-family members also....
"^ ^ Very true. But then, one look at the ""leadership"" south of the border makes us all count our blessings!"
"Amen to that krp! I am so glad I have my case of bleach from Costco! You know... just in case! I am not looking forward to the long May weekend here. There were over 14,000 people travelling here, for the Easter weekend. The Horseshoe Bay to Departure Bay ferry run isn't even operable right now, and still they came. A friend of a friend even said that they were ""no risk"" to anyone here. They were in Winter Harbour, all by themselves, without a soul around. Catching their own dinner! And then even said, that they were safer here on Vancouver Island than in Vancouver, because of the numbers. Talk about a slap in the face to the people here!"
"The same thing is in play here, too, Joan. People think that coming to a small town in the mountains is safer than being in the city. Here in Jasper, we've had 9 cases of covid ... which means the number of cases per thousand people is almost twice the rate of that in Calgary, which is the hot spot of the province!"
With this nice weather its going to be harder to keep people at home. I'd love to be able to visit my relatives on the Island; or hug my family in Calgary; or attend a family funeral in SK last week but I can't and I won't. Why is it so hard to make people understand that what they do as individuals impacts everyone else!!!Just hope the Canada/US border remains closed for a LONG time.
Or go to Kingfisher for the big 65!
Oh JOan don't remind me :-(

"Explain to me why a set of Alberta plates showed up and parked on my street this weekend....I have trouble believing its an essential family visit, but I'll withhold judgement for now.The entire regimen seems to hinge on people doing the right thing. Enforcement seems to be a bit thin across all areas."
"Vancouverite, they may very well live here. I know of two different houses, on the same street, with Alberta plates. One of them moved here just before Christmas. And they have so many months to change over to BC plates. I can't remember the amount of time that they are given. And the other one lives in Calgary part of the year, and the rest of the year, they park in their adult daughter's driveway, in a huge motor home, and stay there the rest of the time. We were out today, delivering dinner to our son's family, and actually saw a car with Nova Scotia plates. Well, just the plate at the front was from Nova Scotia. The plate at the back was from Alberta! Illegal, I am sure, to have two different plates on a vehicle like that."
"Joan, Nova Scotia doesn't have front plates, so it wasn't driving that way when/if registered in NS."
"Maybe some of the Alberta plates in Ontario are actually out of work oil company workers who have returned home?There are certainly a lot of people who feel the stay at home orders are for others. Unfortunately, I know of some who think it’s alright to go to their summer properties.Edited: 11:34 am, April 27, 2020 "
"It's 30 days that you have, to change your vehicle registration and license plates after you move to another province to BC. You have to have an out-of-province vehicle inspection done by a mechanic, and any deficiencies have to be corrected. So that's a disincentive, for anyone who may have an older vehicle and who is tight on funds. Also, insurance is a lot cheaper in Alberta than in BC, and I know people who continue to insure and register their vehicle in Alberta for as long as they can after moving to BC.https:/…Registering-a-vehicle-in-B-C-.aspxEdited: 12:10 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"krp beat me to it on the 30 days and after that it becomes a risky game to play unless you can prove “temporary.” Temporary residence for a few weeks isn’t a problem but in cases where two homes are involved, “primary residence” becomes key. Any insurer involved in a large claim would look for a reason not to pay if residency was in question and “I didn’t know” won’t work.……………………………………….Here’s one that has kept me busy for a couple of weeks.On April 18, a 34’ US registered pleasure boat, crossed the border from WA and cleared customs in Sidney.Since crossing, it has made its way to Shearwater, on the central coast, stopping at six marinas, and two marine parks. Alert Bay was on edge as it travelled through there. It was turned away from one marina in the Discovery Islands and FN Coast Guardians prevented it from stopping in Namu.My assumption is an AK destination.The question I have been unable to get answered is, how could this happen, and why? There is either a simple, logical explanation or some jiggery-pokery. Anyone in authority I have spoken with, has passed the buck. A land crossing would not have allowed such meandering.https:/…"
"The border was closed - why was it allowed to clear at Sidney?Could be there is someone rich and famous onboard who is getting special treatment, maybe Harry's trying to sneak back into Canada :-)"
I am starting to think that some of these threads have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 and that some of these threads should go into self isolation for a min of 14 days )-:
"Kirk ~ You are not moving to BC to live, you are staying for the summer as a visitor. You and your car have probably come to stay in your Vancouver home before without problems.Your question is about being able to cross the border with Covid-19 in the mix. Right now, and tentatively until May 21st, crossing the border into Canada from the US cannot be done for leisure travellers (any nationality), only for people who provide an essential service - food supply chain workers (truckers), people bringing medical equipment/supplies, people who commute across the border to work for one of our essential services. I think this has been explained up thread.When Covid-19 cases drop to within ""manageable numbers"" as indicated by health officials, the border may slowly open to visitors, most likely with conditions. There is a LOT of work to do though, gradually opening up travel within BC and Canada, before that happens."
"Nah, there should be greater tolerance for chit chat during this time. With little travel talk, no personal contact between friends and the risk of substance abuse, why be a curmudgeon?"
"Curious if you rent out your place the rest of the year or pay the empty homes tax? Also certainly sounds like non-essential travel, but you could always drive to the border and see what happens. It is not like there is anything else to do anyway.For driving to other provinces, there are no laws against that, other than the Yukon I think."
"With regards to changing vehicle registrations in Ontario. We moved a month ago. Went to the registry office to change the info on the registration and our drivers license and OHIP cards. They told us to leave, and that the rules are extended for a year. ( yes everything has a years grace now) Perhaps the people with Alberta plates were met with the same."
"@wrldtvler - anyone entering Nova Scotia, PEI and Newfoundland must quarantine for 14 days, so basically they are telling fellow Canadians to stay home."
"Newfoundland has just tightened its travel restrictions. Beginning May 4, only residents, exempted workers, and people with an exemption from her office can enter the province.https:/…"
her = NL Chief Medical Officer.
