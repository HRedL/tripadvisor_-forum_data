"I will drive from KOA to Volcano Village via the Saddle Rd. We arrive KOA at 10:00AM so I will probably get to Hilo in time to have a late lunch. I'll have all of our luggage in the trunk so we need a relatively safe place to park. I won't leave anything visible in the car, nor will I open the trunk when I get to the restaurant. But still, it would really suck if the luggage was stolen from the car on the 1st day.I'd appreciate any restaurant recommendations that have safe parking."
"You may have already answered this somewhere else so forgive me if that's the case but.......why are you flying into KOA instead of ITO?(that said, my first thought was Hilo Bay Cafe)"
"I would stop at Imiloa's Sky Garden Restaurant. The parking area is nice and far from where lowlifes hang out. Also it is right there when you come down off the Saddle and hit the Komohana intersection.Make a left on Komohana, 1/4 mile to Nowelo St. signal, make a right (makai) and it's the second left, at the top of the U of H campus.Websitewww.imiloahawaii.org/22/sky-garden-restaurantHilo Bay Cafe parking is too close to Liliuokalani Gardens, right there, and I would never leave all my stuff at the Gardens, even though odds are good in the lunch hour."
"I would suggest Kens house of pancakes. An extensive menu, great food, and you can park right by the restaurant so that your car is clearly visible."
"A difference in opinion, for sure. I've tried to love Ken's, but the food is from a bygone era when people had no regard for arteries or fresh food. And it's one of those places with crashing plates and silverware. I do t see any reason to eat there unless it's that time of night when it's the only choice. YMMV.And there are lowlifes there in that area. I eat next door at Sombat's, and park over there, but I wouldn't with all my stuff. As amberloo pointed out in the Maui theft topic, lose all your stuff and bye bye vacation. There's been way too much carjacking and theft around some parts of Hilo this last year."
Thanks for the replies. I appreciate the advice.We are flying to KOA because I used frequent flyer miles on Alaska. They have an early morning non stop to KOA from San Diego. So we did a round trip ticket. Will spend the 2nd part of our vacation on Kohala coast :-)
"SunnySanDiego: I'm on the same morning flight from SAN to KOA on the 13th. With all the new TSA issues going on, what time are you arriving at the airport for the 7:25 departure?Sorry to be off-topic, but had to ask! :-)"
"CompmanSD - we're going on the same day! My husband has priority with Alaska so we check in at the 1st class line even though we are flying coach. We'll print our boarding passes and luggage tags at home too.Plus he has TSA global entry/pre-check. He'll get through the security line pretty quick. My nephew and I can't go w/ him but I'll give him the biggest carry on bag and the ziploc baggie w/ my liquids :-) He'll be able to board the flight before us too. At least the big bag will get to go in the overhead bin. Some airlines allow me (no status) to board with him. But I doubt Alaska will let both me and my nephew go with him.So for us, we'll get to the airport at 6:10-6:15. We will have a car service drop us off right at the terminal so we don't have to spend time finding parking."
"If parking is your number one concern and you don't mind fast food, try Kosmic Kones. You can have a hamburger and watch your car through the windows while you eat."
Definitely no fast food for us. I haven't eaten a fast food burger in the last 25+ years :-) My DH and I try to eat healthful as much as possible.But that doesn't preclude us from eating chocolate cake or ice cream!
"I'm with you, Sunny :-) I would take a hard pass on the recs for Ken's, fast food, Cafe 100, etc. Hilo Bay Cafe offers great, locally sourced food, including very good sushi, and lovely views of the Bay. I wouldn't worry about a car there as they have their own dedicated parking lot and I've never heard of any issues. Most other places are street parking or more hidden lots that might give me pause, although Hilo isn't as bad for thefts from cars as Kailua Kona."
"So you're coming on a Thursday? Then Sky Garden will be serving. btw, two of their dessert specials are House made lilikoi cheesecake and sweet potato haupia pie. Desserts are my main weakness.I've never eaten at Cafe 100 or Kosmic Kones, just doesn't appeal. I've eaten at Blane's and Verna's in the past, just do not care for that type of food, or the decor.Hilo Bay Cafe would be my go to for a social relaxing lunch. In your particular situation, I'll just say what I would do. I'd stop at the Imiloa cafe, very safe parking (but always have bags in trunk anywhere you go). I wouldn't go down to the old downtown or Bayfront. It takes about 15-20 minutes to get from the Bayfront to the south of town, and there can be a lot of traffic, which you do not need to seek out given you are coming over the Saddle. If you were entering town via Hamakua, then you would pass the Bayfront.If you stop at Imiloa, it's an easy drop down on Puainako to the Safeway area, where you can shop and then head out on Hwy 11, and with luck you can beat the commute traffic going south if you can get out before 4 PM.Obviously I don't have a stake in where you eat, but it's just what I would do if I were trying to efficiently progress from KOA to Volcano via the Saddle, and wanted safe parking. I like the Sky Garden because it has a large menu with plenty of choices, even though it's not foodie level like Hilo Bay. There's also a buffet and a salad bar, but I've only ordered off the menu. There's a nice view there from the top of Hilo.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Lately in Hilo I hear more about car thefts than breakins. There is more local vs local it seems. I was reading a lady's post that she was in her car in a perking lot with the window down and her iPhone on the dash, and some thieves reached in the window and grabbed the phone and ran off. Never worried about anything like that ten years ago. I still don't feel like Hilo is unsafe, but there are areas where I pay more attention. And locals are complaining a lot about the state of things. It's all about the ice epidemic."
Ice epidemic?
Yep. Crystal meth. www.civilbeat.org/2016/06/hpr-meth-story-2/
oh
I agree with Cafe 100! Great plate lunches and you can sit outside and keep an eye on the car.
"She already said they like healthy food, which is not plate lunch food at all. That's pretty much as healthy as Burger King."
Guess I'll keep my opinions to myself then.
"Burger King not healthy? Yeah, well , you know, that's just like, your opinion , man.Edited: 3 years ago "
