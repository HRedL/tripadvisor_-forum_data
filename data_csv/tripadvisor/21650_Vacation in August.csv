We are planning a vacation for aug.15-22. We already have a hotel but would like information on any good restaurants to eat at and anything to do for two adults. I was also wondering if there is a site that I can go to every now and then to check about the virus to see what might or might not be open
The best central source of information is the governor's coronavirus site: https://www.virginia.gov/coronavirus/
Thank you I will check it out
"A little more guidance as far as restaurants would help. I’m assuming you are staying at the oceanfront. Mostly tourist type at the oceanfront but still plenty of decent options. Check our Chix and enjoy live music outside. Repeal burger and bourbon is a great place as well. But guidance as to type of food and atmosphere (fine dining, seafood etc) would help."
"We would like to try a nice seafood place, and are open to any other type of foods. We have been there before and mostly ate at McDonald's and order pizza. The pizza was good but would like to try a place that you can sit at and enjoy the restaurant. As for doing anything were open to anything. The last time we were there we mostly hung out at the beach or hotel."
"We like Rockafeller’s for seafood. In fact, if you do a late lunch/early dinner (as we like to do), you’ll likely be able to get your choice of tables by the window and take advantage of special pricing."
McDonald's and pizza ?
"When we were their the last time and that's about all we ate due to the fact the couple with us didn't have a lot of money. This time when we come we want to eat at nice restaurants. We're open to seafood, burgers, pizza, Italian etc."
"We have some good places on the southside like Seafood Blue and Spirits, Margie and Rays, Sandbridge Island Restaurant, Fire Brew, Whiskey Kitchen, to name a few."
Always a good meal at CP Shuckers
"We are so far planning on coming in aug and was wondering if we will be able to go in a restaurant to sit down and eat. I was also wondering are face mask require for the ocean, walking the boardwalk, etc."
"Again, the link in post #1 is your best resource. Currently masks are required inside, and restaurants are take-out, delivery, and outside dining only, limited to 50% of capacity. Non-essential businesses have limits on number of people inside at one time.The original open date of June 10 is now “indefinite.” I’d guess by August things will be open, but the situation is fluid and nothing is certain."
The mask policy applies to public transportation and inside buildings. There is no set date for lifting the policy.
