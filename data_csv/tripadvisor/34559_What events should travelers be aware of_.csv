"Hello Travelers,Colleen from the Tripadvisor Content Team here! Over the next few weeks we are going to be posting questions in this forum in order to gather tips and advice about the destination you frequently offer advice to travelers on. The goal being to help gather more personalized traveler and local insights to be able to share more widely across the Tripadvisor community. If you have any questions about this initiative, please feel free to reach out to me in this thread or the TA Support Forum here: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12…We look forward to reading your responses!Today's Question: What events should travelers visiting Hong Kong know about? (Some things to consider when answering: name of the event, when & where does it take place, a description of the event, and any tips for experiencing it).ColleenTripadvisor Content Team"
"""What events should travelers visiting Hong Kong know about?""How about where the protests are taking place?For the past 6 months, we rarely have ""where to sight see"" or ""what are special events coming up"" questions. Most questions posted are about ""is it safe to come to Hong Kong"". You can see it on the top of the pinned question with over 2000 replies.Until the last month questions about 2019-nCoV. Now the questions became ""how can I cancel my trip to Hong Kong"" and ""where do I get my refund"".You can take your time. This ""Today's Question"" will be the same for the next few months, with lots of things cancelled. When travelers' can't even fly to Hong Kong, what local events would matter?"
You can access the Discover Hong Kong - Events page for a fairly comprehensive breakdown and description of major events that are held here in Hong Kong each year (see link)discoverhongkong.com/nz/…index.jspA few of the majors below come to mind Chinese New Year (late Jan to mid Feb - multiple events) - cancelled this year due to Coronavirus Outbreak Hong Kong Rugby Sevens (March-April) - TBD if the event will still be held Hong Arts Festival (Feb-March) & HK Art Basel (March) - both cancelled due to CoronaVirus OutbreakMid-Autumn Festival (September - multiple events)
"I also fail to see the point of this new TA initiative. The specific question posed, in light of coronavirus and on top of protests is not only naive, but offensive to those who care about Hong Kong and its recent struggles. The question posed in the London forum, “How would you describe this destination?” was equally ludicrous and unhelpful.As noted above, the content of the old TA with an updating Top Questions function was much more useful."
"@TA_Colleen you really impress me with this question. It shows me that apparently there are people in this world that are even more detached from day to day reality than those our government. I really didn't realise this is even possible.Well done, keep it up, and you will go a long way in helping TA lose it's relevance. Just like you guys so thoroughly messed up the ""experiences"" thing to the extent that as former supplier I've simply given up on it.Keep up the good work!"
"Look, TA asked. So at least some concern about the forums. There is no reason to be so sarcastic."
"JP, what do you mean,For some reasons nearly all posts relating to it are gone.I still see a full page of questions about Mexican beer."
"I think by EVENTS what she meant is where can you buy toilet paper, mask or rice?"
"The intentions of the question are good. The timing is terrible given the political movement and the virus. We can't really provide useful answers at this point.While I don't think the question is particularly relevant now, I don't understand why anyone needs to show negativity. Posters come and go. TA honestly doesn't care if any of us stops posting. I have seen posters disappear for good. There will always be the next DE ready to spend way too much time here. In other words, if you don't like it, you don't have to participate. If you have an issue, you can always email TA direct or post in the DE forum.I do hope they do a better job of moderating the forums. Too many people post non-travel related content. Some DE's (in other forums) are downright venomous and xenophobic."
"TA Colleen posted the same question to a number of forums. She did not ask this specifically to HK. Yes posters here are hyper sensitive. But she is asking (probably directed by her boss) as a general question to a lot of forums.First we complain that TA don't care about forums. And then when TA asks for some suggestions, we piled on."
"I don't know what's worse - not caring, or pretending to care and in the process showing you have no clue of what's actually going on (just following the news should give major clues on the HK situation, reading the forum a little even more).Top questions similarly: outdated and wrong information is at least as bad if not worse than no information there.And then there's the years old bug that links to other threads of this same forum break the moment you're using the Hong Kong version instead of the international one... TA also doesn't care.One can only hope TA is reading the responses to their own question, and maybe they even listen to the concerns."
"Does TA care? I posted my request and sent several messages to some past contacts about a simple task of changing the title of a longest thread in Hong Kong forum:Is HK save to travel?Stone-walled. It has been an eye-sore for me. Because the word was mis-spelled. The OP may have posted in a hurry. Maybe it's an honest typo. A thread that got over 2000 replies! Lots of people referred new comers to visit that thread. Guess what, it was forcing all of us to mis-spell too! Maybe it is ""not that simple"" to change a thread's title?Edited: 1:13 am, February 07, 2020 "
"There is a Cantonese slang to TA: 攞景定贈慶 (= blaming someone for giving hard time to the other or showing happiness when the other is suffering, in a wrong place at a wrong time)"
There are TAColleen questions in many many forums about activities and don't leave without eating x They are spam from TA to create a new service. Forums vary on how they like this.
Spam is probably best ignored then.TA_Colleen didn't respond to any of our messages either. Wonder whether she's actually monitoring the threads she opened.
