From her ankles to her knees. We were sitting at Schooner Wharf yesterday and I suspect she was attacked by no-see-ums. Any ideas how to make the itching go away? She popped a Benadryl earlier today and now looks like a fan at a Grateful Dead concert.
I heard Nasonex works wonders.
When I have had that misfortune I have used the Benadryl Itch Relief Stick and it brought immediate relief.walgreens.com/store/…
"That happened tours one year, the drug store pharmacist handed us 2 bottles of stuff, and said it would help but the best thing to do is DONT SCRATCH. Very hard not to scratch but it actually works. Sorry I don't remember what the bottles of stuff were."
My wife feels her pain. When we go down she is the one who gets eaten alive and I just sit there right aside her without a problem.
"Is there a certain time of day the no-see-ums are out? I have never had an issue with these, but I know wind direction can have a lot to do with it."
We were told sunrise and sunset are bad tines and being by a light source after dark.
Kampergirl - usually around sunset and sunrise.
"I feel her pain. After years of saying 'I've never had a problem with mosquitos or no-see-ums in the keys', you guessed it, I got hit real bad last month. About 20 the first night while we were watching a storm roll in on our balcony and another 15 or so a few nights later at the Tuna. My legs were a mess, and to make it worse, he was sitting right next to me both nights and didn't get one bite! The itching was intense, but I managed to refrain from scratching and it stopped after a few days (but the red bumps stayed more than a week)."
"yes, it really is painful, even when you just have a few bites.I can't remember what I used but it smelled a little like bleach IIRC...Did anyone else who got bit have any bug spray on? What kind? So we'll know to avoid it. I make it a point to always spray myself down in the bathroom before I step outside in Key West, unless I'm heading out snorkeling. Can't recall the name.All exposed skin gets sprayed.I found that wearing socks can help with the wanting-to-scratch issue, but if you'll be outside it's usually a bit warm to be wearing socks, so if you go that route you might want to eat indoors, in the air-conditioned restaurants."
"I was always the one spared from the bites...until last summer. It was a rainy trip, and I think I also got them from SWB, all over my legs! It was a pain. I didn't do anything for it. Just kept drinking."
"Get a bottle of Benadryl gel -- the gel doesn't have to be rubbed in like the lotion, so it irritates the bites less. It's also cool, so it feels nice.Nasonex is a nasal spray that takes a couple of weeks to become fully effective -- so it does bugger all for your legs."
"They find me no matter where I am around sunset. I have normal white vinegar in a spray bottle. After bitten, I spray or rub on the white vinegar. Within 5 minutes or so, the itching stops. Overnight, the bumps disappear. Not sure how good this will work a day or so after being bitten, as I use it within an hour of being bitten. Doesn't hurt to try considering a bottle is 99¢ at Faustos."
Tea tree oil...stinks to high heaven but works great....Also after bite sticks...
"Oh no! I was eaten alive in Jamaica last year when husband got not one bite. I looked like a lepper. I had 40 bites just on my arms and back. We are going to Key West in August. Now Im nervous. I was miserable . Benedryl at night, lots of alcohol during the day."
"Deet is the only preventative other than covering up, even then I spray my clothing. After bites Benadryl spray does help, a lot. Women's body temps do rise at certain periodic times and just the 1/2 degree can make the difference. They are attracted to heat and carbon dioxide but it's really tough not to exhale. Wind is also a deterrent, they cannot fly or land. Citronella only works on mozzies and the wind must cooperate. 100% Deet is really the only real protection but beware it will melt you rubber or plastic flip-flops. I know, scary. I have camped in the swamp at Ginnie Springs and other inland swamps for scuba and it does work but the health risks are probably substantial. I have always been bug bait. My ex used to joke about hiring me out to garden parties to protect the rest. We divorced.Cheers,Sunny"

"Oh dear.... Not nice I have never heard of these nasty little bugs... What the heck are they???We are going in October for 2 weeks, I hope I don't meet up with them"
"Janet, other parts of the world call them midges. Very small biting insects.you'll also find that baby oil works quite well -- they get stuck in it and suffocate (kinda gross, but no bites!)You don't need to resort to deet for noseeums-- save the deet for mosquitoes, out in the swamp."
"It's very possible the the men/husbands are getting bit as well. They just may not react to them. My husband used to react badly. I would feel an occasional bite, but, the red spot would be gone in a matter of hours. Unlike the weeks it took for my husband's to disappear.The good news is most people react less with repeated exposure. He now gets much smaller red bumps that last only a few days, not a couple of weeks.I've read mixed reviews as to whether Deet actually repels the little buggers. I know a lot of people who have been bitten, despite wearing Deet.Baby oil does work, but, it's messy."
I have never been bitten by these little bugs while in Key West...I wonder why?? We go to SWB and a lot of other places!! Maybe I'm just not sweet enough...??!!
This is the first I've ever heard of these types of bugs. Never had issues before :crosses fingers:
Might try using a cortisone cream on the bites. Because sand fleas and/or no seeums seem to find my husband this always goes into our bags with the Benedryl.
"This may sound silly but my neighbor in KW told me to wipe fabric softener sheets on the bites, or maybe to keep them away, I don't know I'd been drinken. I feel them starting to buzz me in the backyard around dusk or in the shade when I'm at the pool. Always from the knee down, I just spray on some off (30% deet) and they leave."
"I'm the one that usually comes back from vacation covered in bug bites (50+ more bites). Last year from St John and Cocoa beach and the year before that Cambodia. Took almost a month for the bites to go away after every trip. Was more diligent this time when we went to KW last week. During the day, I didn't worry about it, but after 6PM, I sprayed myself down with deet. I came home with 1 bite. It's a miracle!!!"
I have heard of the fabric softener sheets rubbed on your skin to keep no see ums away. It works well for some.There's also a spray made of FL's West Coast called NoNoNo See Ums. You can buy it at any Dion's Quick mart. I've used it to keep them away.
"and lots of people still use Avon Skin So Soft bath oil, just rubbed onto your skin...bug repellant that's actually kind to your skin AND smells nice."
Could it be no see um bed bugs? Big epidemic of these in the us now.
"David, no she definitely got them mid afternoon. We got some cortisone cream from CVS and that did the trick. Thanks everyone for the feedback. John"
"I got attacked by noseeums while sitting on a bench, eating fried shrimp and chips from Two Friends restaurant, waiting for the Key West Conch Train to pick me up. Right by the corner of Front and Duval. And it had rained just about an hour earlier... I started noticing the bites later in the afternoon, all around my ankles. It's weird because on my first trip into the Keys (in early January) I only got a few bites and didn't put on any bug spray, but nowadays I'm making sure to wear ""protection"" as much as possible when I'm down there on my May trips. Has anyone else seen fewer noseeum bites in winter versus late spring?Edited: 6 years ago "
"No see ums aren't around as much in the winter unless it's a very warm winter day. They like sand, dead leaves and such and rocks. Come out around sunrise and sunset."
"Noseeums are absolutely, positively not bed bugs.Noseeums are biting midges of the class Ceratopogonidae -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeratopogonidaeBedbugs are cimicids -- a completely separate family of insects."
"DavidL, the bed bugs would have had to jump off the bed and run down to the Tuna to have bitten me. I was aware of something buzzing around my legs but I didn't feel the bites. Noeeums are not bed bugs, lets make that clear before some stupid rumor starts."
"I'm afflicted every year. Quarter to half dollar sized welts.. They're especially attractive on your face.Hardly anyone in my group gets bitten. I've tried everything (except the vinegar suggestion or the baby oil, will add that to my bag of tricks) Nothing works.. Not even the deet for me."
"buy a bottle of the Avon Skin So Soft bath oil -- the original scent.Rub a little of it on your skin -- straight out of the bottle, not diluted.Generations of Floridians swear by it -- Avon has huge disclaimers, and while I won't make any bets -- I know I don't get bitten when I wear it. (anecdotes not being data, etc., etc., etc)"
Caladryl !!!!!!!!!It's the best thing ever! You can probably find it at the CVS there. It comes in gel form and its so soothing! I use it all the time - it a mixture of Calamine and Benedryl - it will not make you drowsy since it just goes on your skin.
"We have a Winter home on Pine Island, FL and no-see-ums love my wife! One day she forgot to use bug spray and looked like her legs were shot with a shotgun, along with red welts on her neck and arms. Not sure what made me come up with this, other than feeling really bad for her and Benadryl not doing much, but I made a paste out of BAKING SODA and AMMONIA and dap it on the welts with a Q-tip. Within a few minutes she was not complaining about the itching, or rubbing (not scratching) her bites. Not the prettiest, but if hanging at the house, well worth with the war paint look. After it dried up and flaked off, just redab with the paste and good to go for another hour or so."
Tea Tree Oil is meant to be brilliant for bites
Well it happen again on our visit the wife got eaten alive again. I did manage to get a few myself but not as many as her. Some day we will figure something out to stop them. This time when ever we returned to the room she would do a complete spray down with repellant and they still got her. At least this is the only minor inconvenience for her and she wants to keep coming back.
"I am leaving tomorrow and I bought 3 bottles of the strongest sprays I could find in London...I am really allergic to some mosquito bites (not all of them) and the last time I was in Key West (last November), my arm was so swollen and painful I was actually tempted to cut it off. Thank god it happened on the last day of the trip. Otherwise it would have ruined my holiday.Now the only thing is that I'm really pale and I'm wondering if you are supposed to put the sunscreen on first or the other way round! Does anyone know ?"
"We have just returned from two weeks in Key West and neither myself or my husband had any bites at all!!! All we used was Boots Soltan sunscreen/aftersun with insect repellent. I have to say though, it is the first year that we have not got bitten. When we had a day in the Everlgades we also used Boots Repel Tropical Strength Insect Wipes, which we put on top of the sunscreen. We did not get bitten in there either!"
We just got back and neither of us had any bites. We didn't use any spray. I carried a tiny spray bottle of Skin So Soft oil but never needed it. A couple of years ago we camped at St. George Island SP and the mosquitoes just about carried us away! So its not that the bugs don't like us.
"This past Oct. the no-see-ums were just horrible. I carried a bottle of Deep Woods Off with Deep and Benadryl gel at all times. No hair products in my hair (I learned that lesson the hard way).I know if I missed a spot on my skin I get bit and blow up, they don't touch my husband."
"Alcohol in the Hand Sanitizers actually helps, rub it on them and they won't itch!"
