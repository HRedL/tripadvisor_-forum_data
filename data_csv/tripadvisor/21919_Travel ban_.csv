Did I just hear all travel to Europe is banned in the next 30 days?
"Yes, yes you did."
"The United Kingdom is EXEMPTED (however, it may be very difficult to find flights from Italy to the U.K. at this time)"
Yes. I have a trip planned to Europe on April 5th. I have travel insurance but I don't think it's going to cover it. It's with Allianz. What am I going to do?
The ban takes effect Friday night. NOT tomorrow.
GAC...Is it “all travel TO Europe from the US is banned”..or “all travel FROM Europe to the US is banned”... or both...and the UK is exempt because...
"The President said that all travel FROM Europe TO the U.S. is banned for 30 days beginning 23:59 on Friday March 13 (presumably EDT).It should be apparent, that there won't be any flights TO Europe from the US, as the planes would not be returning to the US from those countries.No stated explanation why the U.K. is exempted. Might it be the ""special relationship"" going back to FDR/Roosevelt?"
"Chester... planes won’t go over if they can’t come back. Read more here: nationalreview.com/news/…One reason flights from UK may be OK is numbers. Far fewer nonstops to USA from UK than from European hubs.Edited: 9:44 pm, March 11, 2020 "
>>the UK is exempt because...<<Trump does not know it is part of Europe.
"Of course, makes sense...I’m not thinking clearly as back went out today. thanks."
lol sydneynick...
"UK is non-Schengen... Ireland is outside ban too:""DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf:President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation, which suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. These countries, known as the Schengen Area, include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation."""
Correct! Thank you!
"Very helpful, thank you! But I think that everyone should not travel in this period anyway. Think first of all about your health and the each other's!!"
I'm afraid it is more cynical than that...https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/12/tru…
