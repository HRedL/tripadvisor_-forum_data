"Hello!Does someone know it if it's possible to get a covid-19 test stated in English somewhere on the island? I found some info on the www but nothing that seems up to date. And if, what's the price? I know it's possible on one of three airports that we will need to transit from, but it's around 190-200 euros."
"You can get a COVID 19 at Bangkok Hospital (very expensive: THB 25000), Thai International Hospital (considerably less expensive) and at the government hospital in Nathon.Edited: 1:18 pm, July 02, 2020 "
Thanks for your answer!25000 sounds totally insane
"Covid-19 test for 25000 THB?That may explain the ""allegedly"" very low rates of infections and deaths then."
"I think the 200 EUR or 7 - 10K THB is the starting price at reasonably priced hospitals. Haven't a clue about Samui though.It was posted on here somewhere, and should be easy to find on www"
Assuming you have to fly via Krung Thep anyway. Simply too easy to find that info ... https:/…I think I posted this before:https:/…
"They even have a test kit available for 500 THB, though doubt if that is available to the general public, since they can scam you for 1000s of baht more. TITEdited: 8:58 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"before someone asks:https://www.pattayamail.com/coronavirus/thai…https:/…5e71a2bee3f8e40aef41ff6cThat took all of 1 minute of Google searching. Never let the facts get in the way of a good spin. Maybe the numbers simply are that low. Or most intelligent people realize, C19 isn't a threat to their livelihood, so why bother testing at all.Edited: 9:04 pm, July 02, 2020 "
https://www.samuihomeclinic.com/ is the preferred local gp service of me and most of my expat friends. They definitely have a COVID test but the price is not mentioned on the site. Given that everything else is cheaper there than the hospitals it might be worth a quick email.
"On sale now....was ฿1,790.00 now ฿1,432.00Y'all really need to learn how to search the internet.https:/…covid-19-rapid-testEdited: 10:20 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"OK you own me *Not Me* - I just looked at the list of lab works available. But under £40 ... yay. Result. And sincere recommendation for this facility for any small medical issues on Samui - way nicer and cheaper than any of the hospitals.Edited: 3:37 am, July 03, 2020 "
"Koh Samui Hospital is apparently now offering a 4,000-baht swab test for arrivals under travel bubble arrangements who want to avoid the 14 day quarantine . That's not the same as a SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test offered by private clinics."
