"To the people living in Rome and surrounding areas. How are you all doing amid what is happening right now? I hope you are all ok. I think it’s very easy for people to forget that what is a holiday for us is your livelihood and home. I recently watched a couple of videos that had been uploaded on different social media of neighbours playing music and trying to stay upbeat. It was great to see.I, along with the rest of the world, hope everything settles soon. I work in my local hospital as a nurse so I see first hand what is occurring and it’s very scary and very real. Just wanted to reach out to you all and say stay positive and hang on in there. Things are changing so rapidly at the moment. Thinking of you all!!"
"Well intended OP, 25. Other discussion topics may be more successful."
"Thank you. It's alright. Epidemy is still under control, like 70-80 a day for all Lazio 5 million people. And soon we will see the effects of shutdown. I'm optimistic. And after all, they are asking me to stay at home and work in the garden, not to join the army."
"I know it has to be rough, but I am curious how did it spread so quickly in Italy apart from China where it started."
"""And after all, they are asking me to stay at home and work in the garden, not to join the army.""Appunto!"
Right now the belief is the Germans did it. A German working in the Munich area had a business meeting with a Chinese woman. When she returned home she tested positive. The German then tested positive. This was about the 20th or so of January. After a few days he felt fine and traveled to northern Italy to see various businesses. The DNA of the virus of all (or at least all those who have been tested) seems tied to that one initial contacthttps://tg24.sky.it/mondo/2020/03/07/coronav…
"""And after all, they are asking me to stay at home and work in the garden, not to join the army.""Amen, that's true optmism and I endorse it :D Don't know why so many fellow countrymen of ours are in deep mourning."
"""Don't know why so many fellow countrymen of ours are in deep mourning.""Fortunately, no one I know is, besides a few business people who are naturally concerned. For many, it's business as usual or take advantage of the opportunity of being at home all day to get stuff done / relax. But it does depend upon your personal circumstances (I suspect it's easier in the countryside) and, very importantly, general outlook on life anyway."
"Maybe a better way of putting it is that people are just getting on with their lives, adapting to the restrictions, finding ways around them (I've had several ""virtual"" aperitivi, which is the latest in thing) and taking advantage of the situation where they can. Some couples and families are delighted to have more time together. Few if any I know pore over the statistics or follow the news avidly. The only dark cloud on the horizon for many is money ..."
"""I suspect it's easier in the countryside""I was going to say the same thing :D Many people here feel like they're in jail. I mean, we're trapped, yes, but it's not bad at all if you know how to manage your time.I also agree that it must be bad for business owners and their employees, especially those who don't have a (regular) contract. And fo free-lance workers as well. My concerns go to these categories."
Plenty of people live in fairly small apartments that only work if you can spend part of the day outside.Many people are off work. The kids aren't in school. If you go for a walk you risk a fine. People are surprised many aren't happy?
Now's the time to get that dog you've always been thinking of adopting!
"Yep,dogs look very proud of themselves,because they now ""walk"" their owner for a little extra fresh air :)Also its not easy for those who don't have car,as if you got it ,you allowed to ride to the outskirts of city to some big park of forest with a family and spend time without risk of fine"
Around here we have more dogs that people. Or at least it seems. I'm seeing less dog walking than usual.
"Good one Natasha.I’ve been quiet, but thinking about you all a lot. Just don’t have the words. Tired of writing “hang in there”, feeling helpless. But glad to see some in good spirit. I think perhaps the only thing that can revive things at the moment is a tipping or free tour question. We are pretty much there as well. No fine yet but you risk leaving the house. I’m lucky to live in a house but our parks are not particularly attractive. And I live in a place called “the borough of parks”.My immediate circle of friends and family is fine. But we are in such a service oriented society that it’s dire to say the least. Many friends in the food industry especially are suddenly unemployed and very scared right now.Hang in thereEdited: 7:17 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Well Natasha, if YOU are lost for words than we are trully f$&ed. Your words often resonate in a healing powers kind of way. It’s only been a few weeks but some of my clothes no longer fit. I ate a corn muffin today for the second time this week. I hate corn muffins.I have no motivation to blog. My last post is about a cemetery. I’m getting back into the stock market, which means more money to loseToday I’m moving my oldest home from her school in Philly. Sad times for the kids tooBut first I need to investigate why we have so many corn muffins and more importantly why no one eating them"
"I am trying watch less television, it's brings more panic and confusion, I just follow TA posts, read new decrees of government, world official statistics and news about whether new cure found... Other I don't watch it does not help at allWhat now we can do, if not remain some humor and try to stay fit? Ziggy, I know your sense of humar is always with you, but perhaps don't try to uncover the mistery of corn maffins, may be its better idea to switch from blogging to more physical exercise, could be more relevant to the situation:))"
"Nora, lots of good work out programmes available on You Tube for all levels and tastes in exercise regimes. I still do a Jane Fonda from the late 1980s that, even though I'm fairly fit, can still be bit of a killer if you add the weights and really go for the burn! There's so much you can do at home if confined; catch up on your reading, catch up on your e-mails, cook new recipes, board games, card games, chess games. My bestie now back in Florence is even learning French via Skype lessons. Think positive, take advantage of the extra time, be grateful we aren't sick or suffering."
"Of course, lastraniera! I am actually exercising a lot with weights at home, do yoga, stretches, elliptical... Read, watch, walk, cook... things I never had time to do before. I do listen to the news, mostly government and state official announcements, but at this point all of us need patience. Driving yourself and others into a full blown depression by dwelling on all the hysteria coming from hundreds of news outlets is definitely not healthy. Reposting them on the travel site does not help. We have to remember that coronavirus related diseases are not the only life threatening illnesses in our days."
"Nora, yes gyms are closed,but its the less of a problem,can do it home,also I like aerobic dancesThe most I miss now of activities is my LONG passionate walks through different areas of Rome(and Palermo)♥♥This is irreplacesible,i think you understand me:))"
"@Kuroneko,I am not an expert in cakes and pastry,even if Italy is a paradise for it, my passion is not that,but chocolates,all sorts and colours,Perugina and Venchi shops are my magnetes:)As for travelling,oh sure you are right,I also developing itching for trips,hope all of us,this way we shall burst each others economy very fast!"
I'm more or less ok with Banana/nut muffins. This corn crap will now always remind me of the virus. I'm so desperate to travel that I feel like aimlessly driving somewhere far. But no matter which direction there's no escaping this. I cancelled so many hotels I think I broke Booking.Puglia - cancelled (pre virus)Israel - cancelled Jordan - cancelled Charleston - cancelledSavannah - cancelledDrive to Florida - cancelled
"Good grief, Ziggy!For me:New York - cancelledLondon - cancelled Israel - cancelled (and my husband is not the happiest guy now)I was hoping for the third driving trip to Nova Scotia, but the borders with Canada are closed for non-essential traffic now. All my husband and I keep doing for now are our day trips to Maine, to York and Ogunquit, and walk for hours enjoying the ocean...Well, we all have to get over it one way or another...Edited: 4:47 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"I am antsy - would love to get in car and drive somewhere out of the city but, everything is the same everywhere now. I had a UK trip in the works which I had to postpone before this situation hit so I am looking forward to getting there when we can begin to travel again - and, of course, Italy is already booked (but for late Fall which, obviously, I may end up having to cancel)I've read a few people (not on here) compare some of this feeling and situation to 9/11 and after; I don't personally feel that at all. After 9/11, my office was closed for a long time since we were right by it - I had a trip to Italy already planned and I went - and when I got to Rome, it was all so alive and felt joyful and hopeful and even with my trauma and sadness, I could get out of myself and be in the middle of all that life and touch on some pleasure of it allThis? The uncertainty of just how long, how bad, what's next, where to go, what to do - all of it - it just feels like I can't move and knowing all the people are getting sick (worse), losing their jobs, etc - Looking at the live webcams of some places in Italy is breathtaking - not a soul walking through the piazzas, every now and then I will see a bird fly into the frame across the piazza and I am reminded I am looking at a live webcam.If anyone does find somewhere to go where you don't need to worry, etc - I hope you enjoy it!!Stay well everyone - I'm almost looking forward to threads about ""what is there to see and do in Rome"" -"

"I agree with every word of your post, MCat... This pandemic is definitely not 9/11, not even close... I am wondering who can possibly make this absurd comparison and do those people have memory?Stay safe in NYC!"
"#33 You need to updateCompare https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18… [#832, 840]and contrast casualties from 9/11https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_…Consider how local 9/11, how global COVID-19, how persistent and easily spread COVID-19"
"Sorry, but I am sick and tired of these endless links. We are all adults and can easily find the information we need ourselves. I have zero desire, time or pressing need to compare statistics at this point. I know what our country has been through on 9/11 and this is enough for me as well as for all Americans."
"And even without links, who needs these numbers on the travel forum???"
Thanks @ Post #4 Dennis A for post and up to date details.
"As someone else said, everything they ask us is to stay at home. At the present moment situation in Rome is not as bad as in other areas of the country, more boring than dangerous, but we hope that the lockdown is working and that next weekend or in the beginning of the next weekend cases will start to decline. Because nobody wants to think about the alternative.Thank you for your thoughts"
"guipep71, you comment is a breath of fresh air! Of course, the situation will improve, the virus will go away and Italy will be better than ever. Stay safe, healthy and optimistic! Grazie Mille! Nora"
And the sun is getting stronger and stronger! I am taking sun on my face and vitamin DI believe it will knock down Corona:)
#31 Momcat: Oh I echo your feelings! Looking at the webcams of Rome's iconic places completely empty now is surreal. I am planning to be back in the Eternal City as soon as the craziness ends. Stay well - stammi bene!
"@25 cathTake care of yourself there in UK, hope Boris Johnson will take adequate messures immidiatley, same strict as in Europe,and stop behaving childish, as I am worried about my olderly friends there"
"Thanks Graceinusa - you too! Why on earth is anyone comparing stats to 9/11 - vs. this situation (or any situation)? If this in response at all to my earlier post - I was referring to the uneasiness, uncertainty, etc - and how this FEELS different to me vs. how some others are feeling who feel that the ""atmosphere"" (for lack of a better word) is similar to how things felt here after that day. And, I sure don't need to be told to ""consider"" anything at all vis a vis comparing these two entirely different events."
@25 Hope you'll be well soon!!!
"#47Natasha, it was Nora who made the comparison. It would not have entered my mind. Absurd indeed."
Post 34 and the removed one are direct comparisons which were certainly not done by me.
"""And the sun is getting stronger and stronger! I am taking sun on my face and vitamin DI believe it will knock down Corona:)""Hopefully so, but no guarantee."
"Nora,and Dennis,luckily I did not catch the beginning ,who started it,I just managed to see the end of dispute,and good thing its removed:) but its not important anyway,as whoever started it,I am sure it was without intention to compare it in proper terms,somehow I think it was taken out of contextIts not the time for misunderstandings,lets all kiss and make up:))"
"Yes, let's support each other here, and not compound the situation. However it began, it was without negative intent. Whether the feeling is the same or not, the pain felt is acute for both. I write ""is"" even for 911 as the aftermath deaths from 911-related illnesses will soon pass those lost on the day of the attacks.So much for statistics!There's someone's life and loved ones behind each number and statistic. Let's please be mindful, sensitive and respectful of this as we post daily updates.Vagabonda"
"You are as wise as always, Vagabonda! Unnecessary scaremongering coming from some posters only hurts Italy. My love and admiration goes to Italy and you. Nora"
"Stay with facts. Here are links to major Italian newspapershttps:/…106123268Abbracci delicati con le scarpe, a tutti [gentle hugs, with the shoes, to. everyone]Dennis"
"Addressed to whom?Most readers here don't read Italian, and so realistically how useful are links to Italian newspapers?Has anyone noticed how quiet the forums?No one is posting.There are no travel queries.No one is travelling to Italy.Even those who had booked holidays have mostly cancelled, and have moved on. Everyone everywhere is now preparing within their own families for dealing with this pandemic.And yet there's an obsession on these forums for posting statistics and newspaper links. Certainly anyone with interest could search the internet themselves as statistics are readily available.The sticky links at the top of the Italy forums have outlived their purpose and usefulness, and especially given the lack of travel.Vagabonda"
"Vagabonda #58. At the link, at the top, it says:""This is a set of links to major national newspapers, to see perspectives: both local concerns and broader views. Open in Chrome to be offered a translation to language Google expects you to use:"" The alternative is using media far away or uninformed ideas."
"Brava, Vagabonda! Just wondering if obsessive link posters can do something else with their day besides posting links? It tactless, selfish and useless at this point."
The most important thing in a crisis is to stay in touch with the real.
"Yes, but where?As this virus spreads globally, readers want to know what's happening where they live.There's less interest in travel and travel forums as there's no travel happening for them.And they need to prepare for the pandemic at home.These are the English forums, and readers here don't typically read Italian, so all those links to Italians newspapers won't really benefit readers here. Few will take the time to run them all through translation websites. And why would they when they can read accounts in English worldwide?There are a few newspapers with English editions, but I often link to resources outside Italy for English-language. I might first read an Italian newspaper for the facts and information, and then find a comparable resource in English.Vagabonda"
"Re #58, Bravissima Vagabonda! Well said!"
"I think that you will find there are foreigners in Italy from many places, needing to survive or get home. I think if you have apprehensions about the pinned threads in the Italy forum the place to express those is in one of those. Please be conscious that a participant here, not from Italy, had been like others dismissive of the COVID-19 threat and here had said it was nowhere as bad as 9/11 and nothing like 9/11 would happen again. Thus I offered numbers. Then that person’s comparison was deleted. Good night and good luck."
"To Dennis ATHANK YOU for ALL your posts and links!!Please ignore the rude comments and those just arriving from other City forums who just want to stir the pot!!! Feel free to post what you want- if they dont like it they can by all means scroll on by!!! They do not own this public travel forum!!! That being said- we are continuing to deal with a Global Health Crisis around the World, and appreciate any/all updates and comments. Its a time to come together not fight over nonsense like he said/she said. I am sending continued good thoughts and prayers to the people of Italy. Here is a link for the latest US info from thd CDChttps://www.cdc.gov/index.htm"
Here is a link to a live webcam from Romehttps:/…roma.html
"It was just announced by the US President for all American citizens in Italy, France, Germany, and any Country abroad to fly back to the States immediately, or be prepared to stay in whatever Country they are currently residing/visiting.This is not scaremongering, but facts.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/cor…https://www.vox.com/2020/3/19/21187080/state…Edited: 6:28 am, March 21, 2020 "
"It’s clear that what has developed on this board is far beyond TA’s original intention, and as Vagabonda rightly points out, now that no one is travelling, the tsunami of posts – few of which are genuinely travel related anyway- have begun to outlive their usefulness. Many of us may (and do) scroll on but I stopped to contribute to this particular thread as the OP specifically asked “the people living in Rome and the surrounding area” a clear question, to which I answered in my post #9. The Internet can be an invaluable resource for information - these forums are often a prime example - but the threads and posts of the last couple of weeks smack of something uncomfortably different. Even quarantined at home, an intelligent mind will find a vast array of healthy, meaningful things to do. We certainly live in difficult times, of that there is no doubt, but there is still a great big world out there beyond this wretched virus. Life is rich, so why not embrace it?"
"I haven't been reading this forum since the very early days of the virus. But seeing you here Iastraniera reminds me of happier times and of all the wonderful advice you have given me and so many others. I am delighted that you are well. We were scheduled to visit Italy again in May, and we will return as soon as we get the ""all clear"". Many blessings to you!"
"And to you too, Robin. If I remember rightly, you stayed in one of the pretty villages in the Val d'Arbia just south of Siena? Happy days!"
"I'd just like to chime in here and thank Vagabonda, Lastraniera, Kruoneko, et al for all the great advice they've given--certainly made a difference in the happiness quotient of my Italian trips.Blessings to you all and I hope to be in your beautiful country again soon."
"A pleasure for sure Jackie C!May we all soon discuss travel again.It was hoped that lessons from Italy would have been learned worldwide about faster containment, but it doesn't appear so as trajectories appear worse.Blessings to you as well, and may you stay safe and healthy.Vagabonda"
"Many, many Rome locals (known & unknown) illustrate so much for the rest of us. Love & appreciation to this country seems inadequate."
