"Now that the borders are open again,It will be interesting to hear of anyone's personal experiences.I am thinking of proof of Travel Insurance and the self isolation guidance Taken from the UK Governments website on travel to Ukraine I quote """"All foreign nationals will be required to demonstrate health insurance upon arrival.""""Has anyone had this asked of them?And also the app that has to be downloaded onto a Ukraine phone ""Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine may be completed through the “Dii Vdoma” mobile app.""Any comments will be a big help as my wife is travelling next month.Thanks in advance"
"So you need Ukrainian phone number for the app? Makes no sense. And in terms of health insurance, my usual US health insurance(I have Kaiser) technically should be ok to provide for the trip? They have several numbers listed on the back of the card( US, Canada, Europe) I always bring it with me when I travel. All that is well, but 14 day self isolation is not good given how my entire trip is 14 days total. Ugh! US high numbers do not help and we are not getting better *_*"
"Hi SanOk I spoke to our travel insurance and he will furbish me a letter that will cover all health issues for my wife's trip. I am hoping that this letter will suffice at the border,that she is covered by health cover. Cannot think of anything elseSince posting we have looked everywhere including the website of the Border Control.As for the download of the app it is to avoid a visit to a sanitarium for health check. From what I read it's a difficult app to downloadNatasha it does say the app must be downloaded onto a Ukraine Smart phone. Apparently it can be done at the airport with a ""QR Code"" but that can be a nightmare holding up queues.Edited: 12:11 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"Hi Taureanthanks for that.What travel insurance are you using, if I may?ThanksregardsSan"
So your wife is still travelling even though she will have to be in self-isolation at her destination for 14 days? I will see if anything changes after 4th of July and as much as it pains me - I'll look into cancelling my trip for this year.
San hi. We are covered with travel Insurance by my Bank account which is actually Aviva.Natasha hi. My wife will be staying with her mum and planned not to venture out. How this app determines anything I don't know unless you have to carry it with you everywhere even in the shower!!! How the check is done I don't know.
Thanks a lot Taurean.much appreciated.when does your wife plan to go?thanksRegardsSan
"Taurean & San , since you are in Europe and there are quite some positive changes coming after July 1st - I think your travel won't be too bad. Unfortunately US is banned from all European countries and I don't see it changing much for the rest of the summer. This sucks."
Aaaand it s blocked again...until 17th ia what they say according to unian.
San Tickets booked with Austrian airlines July 3rd (hopefully)
"I go to Ukraine every year in July and I desperately want to be able to go. Unfortunately, I am American. Do you think there is any chance I might be able to go and not quarantine for the entire duration of my trip?"
No. You'd be denied entry and you'd be wasting your money.
"crvela, Hi,I go every year too to see my family and I am in the same situation as you are . I am waiting to see if Europe is allowing any Americans to travel after July 1st, or if there is an extension again, I have until July 25 (my first flight to London) to decide if I am still able to travel. I am not purchasing ticket to Ukraine just yet, I feel it will be harder to get credit/money back on any European flights. I'll be also checking if any other country (not Ukraine) will allow Americans to travel without 14 day quarantine to maybe meet my sister there. It really sucks this year, I am pretty bummed."
>>>>No. You'd be denied entry and you'd be wasting your money.I don't think that is accurate statement. This is from current publication of US Embassy of Ukraine site:The Ukrainian government has lifted the entry ban for foreigners. U.S. citizens will be allowed to enter Ukraine if they can demonstrate that they have medical insurance covering all expenses related to COVID-19 treatment while on the territory of Ukraine. U.S. citizens entering Ukraine will be required to enter into self-quarantine if the Ministry of Health considers the United States a country with high incidence of COVID-19.
"Natasha,If you have patience, every 3 days the restrictions will be re-evaluated by Ministry of Health.I must say , USA amount of active COVID cases very high!!Check embassy site often:https:/…"
"Beams, the poster crvela wanted to know if they could go to Ukraine and not quarantine, if they went and refused to quarentine they would be denied entry.Edited: 5:32 am, June 17, 2020 "
"Snukr,She asked if there was any chance to not quarantine. Answer was no, you have to quarantine!! ))Now if she said I will not quarantine, then you are right.I do see your point!!!Edited: 10:28 am, June 17, 2020 "
"Hi taurean,is it direct with Austrian from UK to Ukraine? or via any stop in between?Thanks"
"Hi Beamswhere did you get this info about quarantine ban lifted in Ukraine, Please?thanks"
"Its a stop in Vienna. I took Austrian a couple of times when flying Paris-Odessa. If a flight is early in a day you won't have a long layover. I took afternoon flight and I usually end up with overnight layover in Vienna. Which is not too bad, last year I was able to travel to city center in Vienna and have dinner there. Its beautiful."
"Hi Natasha, hope you are well and safe.i do prefer a direct flight though. It is already a long distance trip and I am trying avoiding any extra time if i can...thanks"
"Sanyes Natasha has quoted correctly there is a stop over in Vienna and my wife's flight has around an hour!Would second that Vienna is a beautiful city and so clean. Had 3 days solo there last year.There is also LOT that we use with a stop over in Warsaw.No direct flights to Odesa from UKKyiv is the only place that you would get direct flights from UK using UIA WIZZ or RYANAIREdited: 12:26 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"Guys from the french ambassy:- borders are opened you need the vdoma app...you need a ukr phone number to use it. it consists of taking a picture of you at random moments of the day...however the app works really really bad and has lots of complaints that it violates human rights (also 1star on google play)countries in red need to have insurance covering covid treatment abroad + self quarantine 14 days...nothing to add to what SNUKR or BEAMS are saying... i would avoid kiev as the city is showing no progress at all...my target is odessa... so...since i am a legal citizen of ireland i am in the green zone...but i also live in spain where i am now...so i might just take a flight to dublin and then a direct one to kiev and avoid the 14days if i can...I ll take the gamble ;)YEdited: 12:31 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"Hi San, since I have several flights before I finally make it to Odessa with the bunch of stop overs (I usually have stop somewhere in US prior to getting to Europe) I actually prefer overnight in Vienna, it gives me a bit of a rest and actually helps with jet lag. :-) Youss - app that makes you take picture at random times? That sounds hilarious and you could probably cheat it somehow, especially if its not even working correctly. Of course I would not advise cheating, as they will have your address and could potentially send someone to ""visit"""
"Hi everyone, thanks for the useful information in this forum topic. Regarding the App, assuming I have to quarantine on arrival (I am due to arrive 3 July) is it a problem if I leave Kyiv to go to a different City - for example Sumy or Poltava - by car and self-isolate there for 14 days? Will the app only start for 14 days when I arrive in the City I plan to stay?I also read that the app doesn't send messages in the night. Does anyone know what time it stops sending?Thanks!"
I am not sure Lyndon T but believe the app has to be activated at the arrival airport so would sense it starts from your arrival.
">>> where did you get this info about quarantine ban lifted in Ukraine, Please?You misread what I wrote. There is quarantine at moment. I think it is subject to be reviewed periodically."
Hi Youssbcnwhen is your flight? that is a good idea to get into Dublin and then fly to Ukraine.Please let us know if it did work and hopefully overcoming the 14 days quarantinethanks
"I think it is important which passport you have!!!Or if you have on one ticket, a flight which originated from a country which is red!!"
Beams could be right.What if you are transiting (airport only) through a red country but originating from a green one?
"hey Sandro, i wouldn t risk it if i were you... i explain ..my french passport has an irish address on...so ONE of my many plans is to go to ireland and catch a connecting flight to ukraine...and then i d be coming from A Green zone...BUT...if ukr authorities are able to track or ask me where i was during past 14 days...then i m F'd because id be saying france or spain... so there is a risk....my other plan is to spend 7 days in turkey, 7 days in georgia (from the first of july) and fly to ukraine...so i can prove i come from 2 green zones with the stamps on my passport ;)"
"Hi Youssbcn,thanks for your explanation and it does make sense your warning which I do accept and consider indeed.I will monitor the situation as somebody mentioned before every 3 days and I hope and pray that it would change soonthanks a lot"
"Here is my understanding of the app : Various times throughout the day, you will receive a message from the app .... you are REQUIRED to take a picture of yourself with your smartphone and send back within 15 minutes of the request. Again it will be done numerous times during the day BUT not at night when you are assumed to be sleeping.It does not just read where the physical phone is locatedThat picture has metadata on it which shows time and importantly the geolocation. That geolocation is VERY accurate (within several meters, not just same street). The system then automatically matches your face and the location where you are supposed to be quarantined. I received this from the USA Embassy in Kyiv : ""Currently, the United States is on the list of countries with high incidence of COVID-19. Accordingly, you will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. This is a very strict requirement and cannot be waived under any circumstances. You have a choice to self-isolate at your place of lodging or be taken to a health facility 280 kms from Kyiv for the duration of your quarantine. If you agree to self-isolate, be prepared to download a smartphone application called ”Diy Vdoma” upon arrival, which the Ukrainian authorities will use to monitor your self-isolation. To monitor whether the United states will remain on the list, you can check the website of the Ministry of Health"""
My wife's flight on July 3rd has been cancelled.I understand from Austrian airlines that all flights to Ukraine have been cancelled due to the Lockdown being deferred to July 31st.Anyone heard any other news??
"Wizz Air resumed flights between Ukraine and 6 countries yesterday including the UK. I haven't heard of any flights being cancelled, but seeing the number of CV cases in Ukraine rising daily I think they've probably made a mistake by opening the borders too early."
"My Ryanair flight from Manchester is on 3rd July so I am sure we will see soon. As the quarantine facility is 280km from Kyiv as someone stated, surely going into quarantine after arriving at another City directly from Kyiv shouldn't be a problem? Anyone know for sure?"
"John, Thanks a lot for your detailed explanation.I will go into a small country rural village and there is always a problem getting a reception for the Ukrainian networks (Kyivstar etc..). Many times the phone shows""NO SERVICE"" and/or intermittently during the day.On that basis I would Not be able to be online and connected as I should and it would NOT be my fault.What in that case?ThanksEdited: 6:41 am, June 20, 2020 "
Taurean_traveller122 that is very worrying! Did they say why it has been cancelled in specific?Thanks
"John,Likewise do you know what the situation is to go to another City from Kyiv (ie drive to Sumy or fly to Kharkiv) before beginning quarantine?Also, what time at night does the app stop sending messages?Thanks!Edited: 8:07 am, June 20, 2020 "

John SThanks for that input. Yes agree all along as we have read and been guided by UK guidelines and Ukrainian guidelines.The only problem we have had is the App. We tried to down load onto my wife's Ukraine phone but continually freezes. Apparently a common complaint.Don't know when she will go as her flight cancelled.
is you wife's phone an android or iphone?

"After reading John's summation of strict rules for people from red countries I wonder who is going to visit Ukraine !! Your likely full vacation will be monitored and your interaction is very limited. Even someone from a green country will still face limited contact with limited ability to enjoy holiday with many closers.The quarantine restrictions are now extended to July 31 !!!I did read this tidbit: If travelers who come from the “red list” countries have documents that prove they have been in a “green” country during the last 14 days, the border service will consider letting them in without self-isolation, according to the Health Ministry."
"The fact they require a Ukrainian phone number is not so bizarre, as many travelers have inexpensive phone plans and buy some cards when arriving in Ukraine. What is more interesting are the people who have American insurance plans. Unless you have a very expensive plan ... and no, Obamacare doesn't cut it ... the overwhelming majority of Americans policies do NOT cover expenses incurred overseas and when they rarely do, you usually are required to pay upfront and get reimbursed back home, something Ukraine wouldn't be the slightest bit interested in, as they want to ensure they'll get paid for what little service they'll be able to provide, not to guarantee that you'll get your money back when you go home"
Kyiv Post has updated their page on information and rules for traveling to Ukrainehttps://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/tr…
"travel insurance does cover COVID right now... Ukraine has always required the health insurance when you entered the country, but it was rarely checked"
"Again, most of these plans will only cover reimbursement when you get home. I would be VERY sure they will pay Ukraine DIRECTLY and have it IN WRITING. If not, you may be hit with a very expensive bill if something happens to you. (Sort of like the rental car insurance on your credit card. Sure, they might reimburse any car damage later, but if you're in, say, Mexico, for example, and you're found at fault for an accident which put someone in the hospital, they will NOT let you leave till the bill is paid. You want to sit in jail while your credit card leisurely looks into your claim? More power to you!)"
new updates and clarificationshttps://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/fa…
"Typ ;The fact is many of us are only making sure we have the proof of health insurance because it is required by the bureaucrats in UKR. If a person is actually afraid they would be better off not even taking the trip,Personally I think the fiasco was a miscalculation leading to a mass hysteria. If people are not in the higher risk groups the extreme fear is unfounded. The worry about having to pay costs out of pockets is not an issue for most of us, we are just getting the proof of insurance because of the requirement."
"You need a subscription to see those Kyiv Post articles.I've always purchased travel insurance whenever I've gone away, not because it's a requirement, because it's foolish not to. It's also foolish to think you're not at risk of getting CV.Edited: 2:27 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"its even more foolish to think you are going to die of it ... I had it in February and tested positive for antibodies recent;y ... I am 63 , not fat not comorbidites and it was a bad flu with an awful cough that wouldn't go away.If you get it, you have at least a 99% chance of surviving based on IFR... probably ore like 99.7%(My regular heath insurance I ave an addendum to that covers me overseas. With the UKR rues and Covy panic, I got the travle specifically so I could point it out"
"If you think it's foolish to travel without medical insurance, then you're not only a parroting victim of that scam, but you've clearly not read your policy. While most of them are of some value IF you get a medevac policy, most of them cover so little or put so many restrictions on using services, or make claims processing so painful or outright reject claims if they can link them to any so-called preexisting condition, that it amounts to you throwing money away. Basically, the older you are and likely to need such a policy, the less likely they'll pay off. Probably the biggest scam since life insurance policies for your children, who produce no income which needs to be replaced by an insurance payoff"
"Well, it looks like there was another new development.Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers has cancelled mandatory self-isolation or observation for foreign citizens entering the territory of Ukraine if they have a negative result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 conducted after crossing the state border. The Cabinet approved the change in the entry rules for foreigners on June 25, according to the State Agency for Tourism Development of Ukraine.Is anyone able to clarify the requirement for the test? Is it done at the airport? Is there a cost?"
"These new regulations include the statement that:""A policy must be issued by an insurance company that is registered in Ukraine, or a foreign insurance company that has a representative office in Ukraine or a contractual relationship with an insurance partner (a healthcare management organization) in Ukraine. The policy must cover the costs associated with the treatment of COVID-19, observation and the entire duration of stay in Ukraine.""I have asked my company to confirm (or deny) this. If they do not satisfy this requirement then I do not think I will be able to get a new policy now with suitable cover as most seem to be excluding COVID-19 expenses other than purely those to get one home.There is also the problem that, while FCO advice remains to recommend against travel, many insurance policies will be invalid for those who have ignored that advice. I suspect that until FCO change their advice appropriately and UK is in a Green Zone then it is foolish to take a chance, even if WizzAir are only charging £8.99 from Luton to Zhuliany!So much more clarity needed!And whilst an earlier respondent is quite correct regarding the breadth of exclusions in a Travel Insurance Policy and difficulties claiming anything on many, if that's what Ukraine Border Control Officers need to see then we don't have a lot of choice!Read more on UNIAN: https://www.unian.info/society/coronavirus-c…"
"I agree Andrew it’s very unclear. Being from the UK like me you could get a policy with staysure which covers Coronavirus, but as they aren’t based in Ukraine or don’t have a partner or office there (I assume) I don’t know if this will cut it. Like you say, without some clarity it makes travelling a big risk.Details about the testing also seem very thin."
"If that was addressed at me, I did not say travel with the medical insurance. If someone can afford to pay the medical costs and many of us can) you self insure. It is a choice.It is not ignoring the risk, its just that some have higher financial resources."
"There are other issue about the travel insurance policies. Many in the USA do not specifically state they WILL cover COVID .and the larger travel insurance companies give their assurance on the websites BUT it is not in the policy, They have no done addendums for some reason.In the USA there are many major companies other will issue the policy, it will cover COVID BUT will not cover in a country rated a level three. It would be possible to have a policy showing coverage but not be covered. As of now Ukraine is level three.There is a company that issues health policies AND does not have the restriction. They also have an addendum state specifically COVID is covered, I hesitate to d an advertisement for them but they are easy to find and specialize in travel insurance."
"Hi John,The link would be useful under the circumstances and I’m sure wouldn’t be regarded as advertising. Do they cover UK travellers and more specifically does it comply with the following?:“A policy must be issued by an insurance company that is registered in Ukraine, or a foreign insurance company that has a representative office in Ukraine or a contractual relationship with an insurance partner (a healthcare management organization) in Ukraine.“"
"It is possible to buy Ukrainian travel insurance online, but finding any which includes Covid-19 will be difficult."
I have found some which will cover me for Coronavirus in Ukraine...but it is not from a Ukrainian company and I do not know if they have an office or partner there (doubtful).
"That NEW restriction in a company having a representative office in Ukraine has put a monkey wrench into a lot of idea ..... I now have over 500,000 of medical insurance that they will , in theory, not accept.In looking I the Ukrainian companies, there are problem : almost all in Ukrainian and of course they dont work on weekends. there was a list of a few int he newest Kyiv Post article ...It would eb great if someone wh had alred arrived could tell us how they worked through this. I think the health insurance issue applies whether you are from a red or green company.If I get in next week, Ill post on here the process.... If anyone finds an insurance company that works please post.In the qurantine issue , they have announced "" On June 25, Ukraine’s Cabinet of Minister decided to cancel mandatory observation and self-isolation for foreigners after they undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 and the result is negative. The test can be conducted after the visitor has crossed the state border of Ukraine. ""They need to provide distinct guidance that doesnt morph daily. But , as we. all have been told by our Ukrainian friends :This is Ukraine;"
"I am still hopeful of going next week and will post my experience.The best option I could find in insurance was on the UIA website for one of their partners. It says it includes Covid-19, so if that isn’t accepted I don’t think anything will be unless they accept a foreign policy in the face of it.Would still like to hear about the new testing process and the insurance checks too please.Edited: 4:13 am, June 27, 2020 "
"Ukrainian insurance firm pay a lot less than so those in the West, so it would probably be better to buy travel insurance from a Ukrainian firm and also in your own country."
"btw, i had confirmation of your flight going ahead from the Ryanair press office a few days ago (as I have someone aiming to come on the return leg)"
"link on UIA site seems to have disappeared ... here is direct link .... https:/…5e5c20f687f3409543cb515a5a50677eI agree that because of the limited dollar amount this pays, to be safe do another policy. I use Insubuy and Trawick Intl underwritten by Nationwide in the USA .... $500,000 limit ... $250 deductible .... that was around $100 USD .... I talked with Jerry Martinez ... link is https:/…"
Thanks Jez.I saw that UK is now on the green list of countries on the update so I will take my chances!
wait....what????BRB just booking my flight!
"I found this https:/…viewIs this the latest one? if so, why is the UK/Sweden/Spain listed the way it is?And the UK government page hasn't been updated recently either?"
"I am struggling with the lack of info too. It looks like the UK is now on the green list but it's ambiguous. I had a search for Ukraine Health Insurance and there are lots of companies offering it for expats and people working in Ukraine for short periods but the minimum period I can find is for 2 months and it's not cheap. I never got as far as seeing if it covered COVID but I did notice that the policies only cover you for about £5000 . I have no idea of medical costs in Ukraine but it doesn't seem a huge amount to me.Can anyone post a link to the latest versions of the red/green list as the ones I can find are out of date, given it is revised every 3 days."
"Yes, Spain, Sweden and UK now seen to be in the green zone but without much explanation. Maybe the number of flights arriving from Luton became too much hassle? As John posted before, the insurance offered via UIA/ERV seems logical and states it covers Coronavirus. Maybe it is a state provider...so money goes to the Ukrainian government.Again, boots on the ground experience would be great to hear."
">>> Yes, Spain, Sweden and UK now seen to be in the green zone but without much explanationIf you look at worldometer site, Sweden, Spain and UK do not show active cases, it has an 'N/A. Only those countries show this out of over 200 countries listed. What's that about???As far as info listed sivota, much is old news and not fully applicable. Some info does not make sense, logistics in Ukraine is absent!!!Seems new info comes out daily, as well as more questions.Where exactly does PCR testing get done, is there a laboratory at airport.....which airports???"
"For Spain, Sweden and UK it shows Н/Д which means they have no statistics for those countries. It's highly unlikely they're in the green zone.Edited: 4:51 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"snukr,You find it odd that active cases and total recovered is what there are no statistics on .If you had total recovered you could know active cases.( total deaths is shown)"
Lack of statistics makes more sense Snukr - I doubt UK are really in the green zones too as the incidence per 100K was well over 40 a week or so ago (fairly sure it was more like 400 on 14 June) and from what I can see It's plateauing not decreasing.
"I agree that it makes no sense for them to be in the green zone but it's Ukraine so...There may be some truth in that UK/Sweden/Spain don't list active cases so have been greenlighted, especially with the additional resources required for monitoring. Then again, it could easily be just an error.I can't seem to find where the updated list get published.As someone else pointed out, there is a workaround if you get a PCR test (and are negative) but it's not clear where, how or how much this would cost.Finally, from the UK, FCO is against all non-essential travel - though what is considered essential isn't defined. It does mean, however, that a lot of UK based insurance companies wont cover you (they say). Whether someone checking your insurance would know this though is a different matterSo, lots of questions remain unanswered for everyone."
New list here: UK back on the red zone.https://moz.gov.ua/uploads/4/24692-informaci…
"Well, it doesn’t look to me like it’s in the red zone, or the green zone. But with N/A in no-mans land! Hopefully a test isn’t required but if it is then hopefully it’s straightforward enough at the airport to avoid quarantine."
"My understanding of a PCR test is that it takes 48-72 hours to get the results back. However, my mate is going to speak with her doctor and try and ascerain more info. Seems unlikely they will offer this service at the airport."
I read that they had set up a lab at KBP for testing UIA staff. At Vienna airport the results take 3-6 hours for the PCR tests.
that could be interesting!
There are flights tomorrow between London and KBP so hopefully we will learn more.
"The UK press are saying that the FCO ban on non- essential travel will be lifted for some countries this week. So that could resolve the travel insurance problem if Ukraine is on the list. I checked our AXA family annual travel policy (in existence before COVID) and it covers Ukraine and treatment for COVID (but not travel cancellations due to COVID unless booked before a cut off date in mid March). I still need to find out if there is an affiliation between them and a Ukranian insurer. A quick Google suggests that AXA sold their Ukranian business a few years ago. I still can't see how border control could check that bit quickly though, given all the insurance companies in the world and the need to get people through in a reasonable time."
"Great Info guys ... as people arrive, please take the time to give input to those of us coming ... I arrive late this week.."
"Out of curiosity John, what is your plan?Your coming from red zone country so you are subject to 14 day quarantine, if you choose self isolation you need a Ukrainian number BEFORE you go through passport control. You can buy sims of other side of control.Then you need insurance policy covering COVID associated with a Ukrainian company.There is no info on PCR testing eitherAre you staying more than 14 days?Hope all goes well for you..... way too much uncertainty for me!!!You may be our Guinea pig!!! )))Edited: 7:00 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"Sivota - John S posted a link here where you can take insurance in Ukraine. I have purchased it for a month for around 20 euros. Like anything, we don’t know if it will do the trick but worth a try!There is a lot of uncertainty. I am due to fly early Friday morning but there are still several things I might need some re-assurance over before taking the risk of a flight:1) I do not have a Ukrainian SIM card yet either - is it possible to get one before immigration or not? 2) will I still need the App installed if I take the test at the airport?3) Is UK even in the red or green zone?4) what is the process then for installing the app if I test positive for the virus?5) How much is a test? How fast are the results? How do the test results link in with immigration?6) is the insurance policy sufficient for the criteria?7) if I can’t overcome some of the obstacles above, what is the outcome/consequences? Can I take a flight out of there? Will I need to?I understand a 3 hour flight is nothing compared the the people from USA but I’d still prefer a degree of certainty of what to expect!Hopefully UIA are flying into Ukraine from London today do you would hope they will have an idea being the national carrier. But I am flying with Ryanair."
LyndonGood luck and please be so kin d as to report back.My wife spoke to the Ukraine Embassy in London yesterday and they just said to her call nearer her flight date (Aug 3) as things are changing daily.If that doesn't inspire wannabe travellers what will!!
"Thanks Taurean,I’ll be checking as close to leaving as I can. If it doesn’t look good I will pull the plug on this trip.I hope Ryanair staff may be able to help beforehand, but as this is the first flight that will land there I won’t hold my breath.Surely they will at least make money if they thought about selling Ukrainian SIM cards on board!"
the guidance I have seen is that you get given a sim card if you don't already have one.If you're anywhere near Reddish you're welcome to borrow mine?
"Thanks for the offer Jez, I was in Altrincham but will be driving over from Yorkshire now but appreciate the offer! I read that they had stopped selling them pre-immigration, but surely even in Ukraine they will have a solution - otherwise it would cause chaos I’m sure getting through, with people left in limbo.Of course if the UK is conveniently not in the red zone it will be much less hassle all round - but I’m bracing myself for a worst case scenario, if I do even go. And then there is the issue of the Covid test! All fun and games..."
"Thanks Lyndon/Jon. I found the discussion about medical insurance cover and my son was taking it out last night. The cost was under £5.00 for his trip of just under a week so excellent value. He should also be covered by our own policy if FCO lift their ban on non-essential travel. Here are the links for anyone else who wants them.https:/…travel-insurancehttps:/…Lyndon are you flying from Manchester via Budapest? If so and you have hold luggage, my son checked with the Budapest Airport Police about whether he could reclaim his baggage and transfer to the next flight without filling in the Police form in advance (required for entry into Hungary) and they told him that that it wouldn't be an issue. Good luck with your trip. If you do make it, please share your experience."
"Hi Sivota,It’s a direct flight from Manchester to Kyiv but I did consider going via Dublin or Budapest. If I take the trip I will report back here the process and everything it involves! Good luck to anyone making the trip - the first flights from the UK go this evening so if anyone has first hand experience it would be great to hear. I suspect UIA will be more prepared for their flights from London."
"I am surprised I do not see Iceland on the red zone green zone list. Am I blind or does anyone know why?It seems like it might be possible for someone from the US to fly to Iceland, get a covid test at the airport. Spend 2 weeks there and then go to Ukraine. I would rather spend 2 weeks vacationing in Iceland than 2 weeks of self isolation or quarantine in Ukraine. I work in Tech and can work remotely anywhere compatible with a US time zone and get full pay. Jamaica could also be an option for me.I am very frustrated by all these rules. Each EU member is treated as a separate country, but the US is treated as one country. My state (Washington) would be in a green zone -- or almost."
"Dave, Iceland is on the list (page 3 about halfway up) and well in the green zone.I hope there’s a new list tomorrow which clarifies the position of UK, Spain and Sweden. Even if it’s red I can make a more calculated decision."
">>>> but surely even in Ukraine they will have a solutionLyndon...that is funny!!!!If you have been in Ukraine, you would know things are done from the hip....."
"This will be my 20th or so trip, and I’ve seen some things.I’m not naive...but surely a Tom Hanks type situation in The Terminal couldn’t really occur. Could it?"
">>>> Could it?Who knows what will happen!!!! I think what likely will happen is sheer chaos, no one really knowing proper procedure so fudging going on. ie: let go through immigration without Ukrainian number, can get later. COVID testing done in 45 minutes(Haha)"
"Thanks Lyndon, I am glad I found this forum. I am planning to wait a month to see how things settle down. At this point a covid test on landing and 14 days in Iceland (where I can sight see by day, and work remotely by night) and then off to Ukraine seems like a good plan. Better than self isolating with some flakey app asking me to take selfies. My girlfriend from Ukraine might join me towards the end of the 14 days if she can get off work. I don't think Iceland is in much risk of going from green to red.I have seen a few people suggest a covid test before departure could avoid self isolation/quarantine, but I have not seen that on any official Ukraine site. Does anyone know the facts about this?I have the freedom to work anywhere with decent internet and more or less compatible with US time zones, and it is frustrating I am stuck so far away from my friend. I do have another friend in Kiev who manages the visa processing for Ukraine and I will find out what she knows. If people here have specific questions I will summarize them all and ask my contact for clarification."
Iceland won't allow you to enter coming from the US.
"Coming from Germany I entered Ukraine today at Lviv airport.Despite having been to Belarus within the past 14 days I had no problems at border control. I don't have to undergo a self-quarantine or do a Covid test. There was no questionnaire.But you need to present a document from a health insurance stating that they will cover Covid treatment. This was even checked before we boarded the plane, at least one guy was rejected because of it."
"Thanks Guide698683, that’s really useful information. Would be great to hear from anyone that has visited from the UK yesterday or today."
"Germany is in the green zone, so it's citizens don't need to quarantine."
intersting that they didn't flag up the Belarus thing!
"Actually I have fluid plans :1) Currently you must stay at least 14 days. In case PCR testing etc doesn't work out, I will work out of my apartment2) To get a pcr test in Kyiv. There is little to no information about how to report the negative resut whcih breaks quarantine. I know of one group that says they return results in 3 business days (yhey dont work weekends, this is Ukraine..lol)3) I now have multiple insurance policies (lol) This website links to two that meet the citeria https://visitukraine.today/4)The sim card, from my understanding IF we know someone who can get the simcard for us ahead of time. We can give that number which will satisfy the requirement. THEN we must install it when we reach our destination. UKR will have where we are staying as we go through control so, if yo dont install it or ignore the app, expect a knock at your door. I have already heard of one person form Kuwait that had that happen.I really dont think it will be that cumbersome. Just details to make it smooth"
COVID test must be performed in UKraine from mu=y understanding.BTW at pet peeve its Kyiv
I’m reluctant to book accommodation because it all hinges on the 2-week quarantine and whether I can freely move around. I may as well stay in Kyiv if I have to quarantine - but then I won’t know that until I enter KBP!Hopefully someone who has arrived from the UK will post their experience. Also surprised about the Belarus thing...my initial plan was to travel in via a green country which looks like it would have worked.
"Some more clarity on the process can be seen here:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq62xTuEjVoSo effectively I just really want to know whether the UK is red or green zone now. If it is red, I probably won’t travel."
"I sent a message to KBP airport and they told me UK is in the red zone. Also, no testing is available at the airport, you need to do it privately somewhere in Ukraine."
"Even more mind boggling is the info on quarantine on the visit Ukraine website!https://visitukraine.today/If you click on the 'more info' link it says:During quarantine it's not allowed:To stay in transport, shopping malls and entertainment centers, shops, premises not wearing personal protective equipment, such as respirator or face mask, including homemade ones;To leave observation places on your own.So does that mean you can go out if you wear a mask and find a friend? TA needs to add a head in hands emoji - I'm stressed and I'm not even going!Edited: 2:12 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"It’s crazy...and if you’re not allowed out, how do you take a test?I think my only hope is an unlikely air bridge announcement tomorrow..."
"as I have said numerous times ... many of our friends understand the statement ""This is Ukraine"" as the answer to absurdity and inconsistency like this"
"You're not allowed to go out during quarantine.The insurance they're selling is cheap, 3 € for 3 days and 0.72 € for each extra day."
"The insurance isn’t the issue. It’s the other logistics of having a SIM card, installing the app, passing immigration, getting to your accommodation, taking a test etc, waiting for the results, quarantine..."
"You have a choice of taking a test or going into quarantine.I've seen it stated it's possible to buy a SIM card on your flight. I've seem that on UIA flights, but I'm not sure if other carriers would do it.The danger with taking a test is if it shows you have CV you'll be refused entry into the country.Edited: 6:59 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Yes you have a choice but you are in quarantine until after results of a test which could take up almost 1 week before you know.....plus whatever cost of test they provide which can be whatever they charge.I have never been on or seen an UIA flight which sold sim cards, That's news to me. I have been flying into Ukraine for 16 years!!! Maybe I should have asked? )) Maybe they have several plans to choose from. I wonder if you can choose a carrier too? ))If you are positive for COVID, you'll have been in the country for almost week. Wondering how you are 'refused entry into the country'? Shoot, you could have exposed many people which in turn exposed many others and the domino effect starts!!!Edited: 7:24 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"I am glad I found this forum it will be interesting to see how things work out and I am looking forward to here experiences. I hope to go in August, but it depends on travel and virus rates and how all the rules evolve.I do have the freedom to work remotely. What would be good options for a green zone bridge country for an American to stay for 2 weeks on his way to Ukraine a country that has these factors?1. Allows US people to go there without quarantine (a test on landing is fine)2. Safe and not too expensive to stay or to then head next to Ukraine3. Compatible with working remotely in a US time zone (I am willing to get up early and stay up late within reason)4. Reasonably easy for a person who only speaks English to get around.It seems like options would be1. Mexico. Does anybody really believe Mexico is truly in the green zone?????2. Jamaica3. Bahamas4. Dominican RepublicI have been in all of the above countries before so I know what to expect to some degree. I have only been to Ukraine once. Also in none of those countries are there any English language barriers.Any ideas? Caribbean to Ukraine looks like a rather long trip. But I would rather spend 2 weeks working and vacationing in Jamaica than stuck in a hotel for 2 weeks in Ukraine and dealing with all the requirements.The problem with just biting the bullet and staying stuck in a hotel and working remotely in Ukraine is my work hours would be about 7PM to 3AM in Ukraine. I can do some work at any time, but I have many teleconferences. That is not impossible but inconvenient."
"Snukr,Just in relation to a few of your points...mostly things I learnt in the last few days.1) like beams says, I too have never once seen SIM cards sold on flights going into Ukraine. I suggested that Ryanair (And others) should consider selling them, but my flight is the first out there and I doubt they will have thought that far ahead.2) you need to know the telephone number of your Ukrainian Sim when you go through passport control. You do not need to have it installed at that time but they suggest a friend or family member buy your sim in advance of your arrival.3) You cannot take the coronavirus test at the airport. It was mentioned in the minister for healths speech yesterday. You need to find a facility in Ukraine that will do it. If you are negative, they notify the government and you no longer need to use the app. If you’re positive, you need to continue with the 14 day quarantine.Edited: 2:41 am, July 02, 2020 "
"Beams. How do you know how long the test results take? If you take the test you won't be able to go where you want, you'll be held somewhere secureI've been flying to Ukraine for 24 years. It may not have been UIA, but I've definitely seen SIM cards sold on flights, possibly Wizz Air? No plans, just the packets you can buy with a set amount of call time and data. By carrier I meant airline. Everyone can choose which airline they fly with.As I already stated you'll be held securely, you won't be able to roam the streets and go where you want."
"Lyndon1) I have now checked and it is possible to get SIM cards on Wizz Air flights.2) Do you have a friend or family member in Ukraine?3) You don't need to take the test if you don't want to, so long as you quarantine for 14 days. Of course if you think you may have CV during quarantine you should of course take the test."
"Snukr,I asked Ryanair and they said they won’t be selling them. I have a friend there and I could take a test but I can’t be bothered with the hassle and possible quarantine. I’m going to have a few days in Germany instead and try Ukraine again later in the year.As far as I’m aware, if you have the app installed you are allowed on to your onward destination in the same and once there, activate the app and it then works for 14 days sending messages throughout the day.Edited: 5:18 am, July 02, 2020 "
"For info on this...You have to have the app installed, you don't have to have the sim installed. You have a 24 hour period from arrival to activating your sim (which means you can go to the shops).If you are staying alone then you can go out up to 2km from where you stay to take the test. Also, taking into account the number of chances you have before it flags up an error, that should be fine even if the testing place is further away - the test takes a couple of minutes maximum.https://expatpro.co/blog/rules-of-isolation"
"Jez, you don’t have to have the sim installed but you have to know the phone number...If I’d known the 2km rule it might have changed things for me, especially as I found somewhere to take the test for $9. Anyway, with the hassle and thought of being anxious at the other end I’ve changed my travel plans. I could have travelled to another green zone country and entered that way, but couldn’t be bothered with the additional cost and complication.Good luck to anyone making the trip shortly!"
">>>Beams. How do you know how long the test results take?I don't know but I am basing on what I have seem in normal testing of 3-4 days. Can't picture Ukraine getting test done asap. Maybe there is paying extra for expedited testing? And what about false negatives and false positives? And retests?When you are in self isolation, I didn't picture you are in your place 24/7 without ability to leave to go outside. Not even to get food or just walk around. Has it been actually mentioned what you can and can't do?"
Latest England COVID stats make interesting reading - it looks like the average rate per 100k has been well below 40 for several weeks. Even taking into account current peaks in Leicester it looks to be about 10.https:/…covid-19-local-area-data
"""Jez, you don’t have to have the sim installed but you have to know the phone number...""noooooo. That's a misnomer - If at the time of crossing the border you have only a foreign sim card in the phone, you have to show to the Official that you have installed Act at Home app and stopped at the point where you have to enter the Ukrainian phone number for self-isolation registration"" I found somewhere to take the test for $9."" - details and link please!!!!my mate is still due to fly in tomorrow."
"Hi Jez,I read both reports about only needing a number and stopping at the app installation screen. Several websites stated that you needed to provide the number to the border authorities because that’s what they would use to contact you if you didn’t respond to the app. Anyway, I couldn’t be sure so have opted against travelling.The test place was in Sumy where I was due to travel on to from Kyiv, sorry!"
"We are planning to arrive by car into Ukraine. However, to reach our destination / home of our family relatives (parents of my wife), it still would take 1.5 days of driving. Now it seems at least NL is lifted from the 'red' to the 'green' list, but ""what if""? What if we would need to go in self-quarantine, would we be able to at least travel to 'our' house?Edited: 3:02 am, July 03, 2020 "
Can someone who has gotten through please share the COVID-19 insurance they used. I'm trying to find a Ukrainian one online but it's not easy.
https://visitukraine.today/ there are two listed in this site ... i go in tomorrow and will know then
Good luck John. End of July would be nice for me now.There are some testing centres listed below this video and some useful information:https://m.youtube.com/watch…Good luck!
"Lyndon, on your video link, girl said cost of PCR test is around $150 and results in 2-3 days AND advises to use interpreter to help and be sure you understand procedures at lab and make sure if negative result will be properly sent to authorities!!"
"Great seems good, do you have this insurance yourself? if so let me know how it goes, good luck."
"It doesn't work for me, filled in the form, they are supposed to send a confirmation code on email which I don't receive, did anyone else use visitukraine.today ?"
"I heard mixed info, they just need to implement the testing site at the airport like many country like Jamaica, Turkey Dominican republic, Barbados it's easy who's Going on vacation for self isolation."
"It is interesting that this clinic has home test kits:https:/…Why not sell home test kits at the airport and then just have a courier pick them up or just require travelers to drop the swab off at the clinic?Depending what I read here I am planning to give it a go early August. I have a friend there who can help with translation and such. I will ask her to call the clinic to find out about buying a test kit in advance (and SIM card, but I have found some places online to get a Ukrainian SIM card).The cost of a test kit and a few days in isolation is not that big a deal, IF they work the kinks out of the process. It seems like they just now defined how test labs can upload results.There is still no guidance of limitations, if any, where you can self isolate.I think more countries should just require tests on landing, but make it done at the airport like Iceland and Austria. They also charge about the same price."
">>>>Why not sell home test kits at the airport and then just have a courier pick them up or just require travelers to drop the swab off at the clinic?And a...……. whose dna will be on the swab??? Why even take a test, just ask people when they arrive at airport if they are infected or not."
"ok here is the story coming into KyivKLM checked to see if I had insurance before I was allowed to board in Amsterdam. (The links I posted before both worked as insurance)2)As you get off the plane in Ukraine you are temperature checked3) At passport control the ask if you have the app installed a) If you do not the y send you over to scan to install the app on your phone b) If you do have the app installed they want you to enter the Ukrainian number in the app to make  sure it works 1) You MUST have a sim card installed or you have to take a screenshot of the number and  then you are allowed to progress back to passport control4) Once back at passport control they ask for proof of insurance and where you are stayingIf you did not have a UKR sim card installed, you must install it as soon as possible.after leaving the airport.It i actually very simple. IF i had a UKR sim card already in my phone it would have taken less than 5 minutes for everything.Im trying to find where we can do the PCR tests and will report in the next day or so. Ill also post about how the app works after i install the sim card.The whole process was nothing at all,"
"If my girlfriend has SIM card for me and wait outside airport, will this be ok for them???She mail me a SIM card but it still not here yet but can buy me other and send me number. Thanks"
"John S, please let me know what you have found about the covid test.. i am planning to come in on 16th. Do you have to do the test in Kyiv or can you do it at or near your final destination, say Vinnitza for me?"
"Hi, @ John S... will this insurance work: https://covid19.vuso.ua/engEdited: 2:14 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"I had that policy and this one just in case ... not sure if both were ok, but i had no issue,https://visitukraine.today/ there is a link for two insurance policies there"
"here is a problem I am still having today ..... I did not have my simcard before and at the checkpoint, they screen printed the phone number and took down where I was staying etc.After arriving at apartment and installing screen card and firing up the app ... i get this message ;"" Помилка ліміт спроб на Вхід в додаток на сьогодні Вичерпано Спробуйте будь ласка завтра"" which translates as : ""Error limit of attempts to Login to the application today Exhausted Please try tomorrow""It is the next morning now and I receive same error message when trying to activate!!!! ... I am screenprinting when I try to start app just in case the authorities have an issue It proves the problem is on the app side. Will attempt throughout the day today t get it working."
"How did you prove the address you where staying at, Can i just show them the address and they accept this.I will be staying at my girlfriends apartment."
">>>> I will be staying at my girlfriends apartment.You do know you are supposed to be in isolation?You don't have to prove where you are staying, from app it will show your location from photo."
">>>>> The whole process was nothing at all, John, I think you spoke to soon!!There are too many unknowns involved in process at moment"
"Im sitting in Kyiv right now ... so this is experience ... im by the passage areaThe app is the issue, that I am working through after that NP< except scheduling pcr test"
"suggestion is to have simcard installed before you hit Ukraine. That way they can set everything up for youThe app is ONLY Ukrianan and there are zero instructions if you dont read UKR. My app is up and running, I have not has a request yet an will update when it happens"
"efruydfjv,You can try this link:https:/…We had no problem bying it. We are going on the 14th of july."
Has anyone had experience coming in from a green country? No such issues?
Hi there! I am half tempted to fly in via Germany. How are you supposed to prove you have not been there 14 days!? If you had 'family' in Germany you would have no hotel booking etc...?
"Chris, that’s my question too...flying in from a green country on a green passport!"
Passport stamps
"App still possible frozen ... have received any requests for picture or anything all day ..... this was the potential issue many had talked about .....following the rules but the app screws up ..... The law was written so that there is no problem from our standpoint BUY t is massively flawed because of the app not working correctly. Shows 13 days requited to Quarantine still, will be interesting to see if it changes to 12 tomorrow"
John S do you have a sense on the length of time it may take to get the test done and get off the quarantine ? I’m able to schedule the test before I arrive and then should have the results in 24 hrs but I wonder how long it takes to get all that stuff done to get off the app
"In theory its very quick ....once you have the results, i wouldnt worry ....The clinics are supposed to report directly to t he Did you find an english speaking clinic to do the test. If so do you mind sharing""“An institution that has performed PCR or ELISA research, at the request of a person to terminate self-isolation in case of a negative result, sends a message to the Center for Public Health of Ukraine.

There are few clinics where i am going (Vinnitza) https://medilabs.com.ua/ is the one i'm planning to go to. But i'm also checking on some options in a public hospital as well.I speak Ukrainian so i'm not sure what the English situation is in those places. i'm just concerned about the time it will take to get take off that app. I wish there was someone on here that has done that.
"app.. just requested I take a picture, again all instructions are in UKR.You tiltyour head in various positions so it is not ju someone taking a picture of a picture of you.Not to bad, but again, if it were in english t would be easier. so far today one request. you get npoinformation if you are ok"
"Im flying to Kharkiv tomorrow morning now! I hope all will go well. I have insurance and app, Hope this is all i will need and things will be ok.Thanks for all the helpful information on hereEdited: 1:13 pm, July 05, 2020 "
Simon - can you report back on how you got on getting through at Kharkiv and also if you find anywhere to get the test done in Kharkiv please.
John So are you trying to do the Covid test and get off the app or are you planning to sit on the app for 14 days
Im going to do the test... but I wanted to do the app so people had some info about how it works
"Gotcha, well good luck. If you need some help with translating feel free to call me I’m in EST time zone. I’m very interested in the time that it takes them to submit the test and how long it takes to get rid of the app. Thanks!"
"Yes, I will report back. Little worried about travelling but i think all will be good. Fingers crossed anyway! I buy travel insurance recommended from here so i hope it will be good."
Strange feed back from my sister in law who flew into Zhuilany today from Denmark. All that was required of her was a temperature check and asked where she was staying....Mykolayiv!The plane was from Copenhagen so maybe because it's in the Green Zone nobody was checked.All those who had the downloaded app went to produce them and none of them worked . So much for all the publicity of having the app on a mobile phone with Ukrainian sim!
"Taurean,With a Ukrainian passport, and coming from a green country assumptions were made. Didn't your sister-in-law let authorities know where she had stayed? )))As I said many times, this the unknown, app is new and kinks need to be worked out."
">>>> Im going to do the test... but I wanted to do the app so people had some info about how it worksJohn, Hope all goes well with testing. From what I have read is 2-3 days. Who knows? I don't see the incentive of Ukraine labs to rush to get results out...… unless there is extra $$$ involved )))))I did see a couple labs with cost appox $100. Lyndon said he found one in Sumy for under $10( if I remember correctly)"
My GF said this clinic is goodhttps://dila.ua/From reading the web page it seems like they send a nurse to your location for the test. This would all be rather daunting unless you speak Ukrainian or have a Ukrainian friend.I would expect you could isolate with a friend if you both follow isolation rules and both take a test.
"I need to know following information.How much do they charge for Covid19 test at arrival in airport?How long it will take to have the test result?I saw some complain about tracing app.If I fail to take selfi in required time, how much penalty are we expecting for each miss?Hope someone have already enter Ukraine could share these info asap."
Hi BeamsYes you may be correct re assumptions. No questions were asked of my SIL she lives in Denmark but was travelling by train to the south and thats the only question they asked.
Covid tests in Ukraine range between $100-150 anything under that is probably not going to get you anywhere. My understanding is that you prob can pay a little extra and get the test results expedited at least that’s the case in Ukraine with other tests. Fine for breaking quarantine is roughly $600
The app does work ... i unloaded then re downloaded it .... i wanted to be safe .. it is a sillt app though
"Thank you AK for your answer.About tracing app, I read somewhere that selfie request only comes in day time. Is this means, if we go for shopping or a little drink at bar in the night can not be traced?All nessecarry information can be just show on my phone screen? As I don't have access to printer.Do I need to show return ticket confirmation and bank account balance as well? For those who entered Ukraine from UK, please confirm if UK is in Redzone or not.Could you also share the website of insurance that worked again please?There are several insurance site has been mentioned but I need to know the one which worked at the border)"
"I'm all for helping eachother but dude, all the information you are asking is in this thread..... please do some legwork yourself.. everything, including red/green list links, are all within this thread.as well as some of it is in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch…Edited: 9:08 am, July 06, 2020 "
"Yeah, I understand someone in this forum call up to the airport to check as UK is grey zone due to lack of stats in the list. Their 3rd July updated list also showes grey zone.I was hoping someone who actually crossed border may be able to confirm it."

>>>> I was hoping someone who actually crossed border may be able to confirm it.Let me simplify...…. if it ain't green then it is quarantine!!
">>>>> If anyone knows or another way to get there from the mainland U.S., please feel free to correct me. Thank you.Another member here, John, a few days ago transitioned through Amsterdam"
How? I can't find any KLM flights and I was under the impression Amsterdam was not letting Amis in
"John, I only read that AMS will let in transit psgrs if traveling on ""essential"" business and in any case, I see no flights from anywhere in the US (incl. LAX) going to AMS in August!"
"I am not sure where you are looking but I see flights with Delta, Air France, KLM, Turkish and LOT.Prices of ~$1300 in July, $1100 in August and Under $700 ( Turkish) in Sept. All LAX-KBP with one stopFlying through Germany and UK are definitely quarantine at moment."
">>> I only read that AMS will let in transit psgrs if traveling on ""essential"" business and in any caseI found this on Delta site re flights through AMS:Passengers traveling to or through the Netherlands are required to complete and present a Health Screening Form (English/Other Languages) at the departure gate prior to boarding.This is the form:https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/Gezondheidsverklaring+(versie+2.0).pdf"
"That's bizarre, because the Netherlands government site specifically says no travelers who aren't performing essential travel!"
"To be fair, I was looking at lwo, not kbp. But I do know for a fact that LOT is absolutely not available in August and Americans are absolutely banned from entering Poland for ANY reason if they're not a citizen or married to one (as I am)"
">>>>> But I do know for a fact that LOT is absolutely not available in August Out of curiosity, I checked skyscanner, starting on ~Aug 18th there are flights to Warsaw out of Chicago. The flight out of LA-Warsaw re-starts on Sept 1st.According to IATA, flights to Poland suspended till July 14( other than mostly countries in Europe) and there is quarantine for anyone other than same countries mentioned before. I don't see anything about transit."
"Because you have assumed correctly. Transit is irrelevant. The only Americans let in will be those holding Polish passports or married to Polish citizens. And even then, I STILL won't do it, because you are subject to a 14 day quarantine."
I was just going through Amsterdam and then on the Kyiv ...... In Amsterdam the checked I had insurance before I boarded ... that was it.My USA flight went Atlanta to Amsterdam on Delta and KLMI am sitting a few blocks from Maidan just off Kreschatyk as I write this.
"Well, I've booked to fly into LWO from PHX via IST.Now, let's hope that when I get the test somewhere in LWO on the 19th of August, they'll clear me before I pick up my rental car on the 23rd!"
"I'll try and post info on my gf's experiences of returning to Ukraine from the UK. no insurance requirement as she's Ukrainian.She arrived yesterday lunchtime, had to install the app, She hasn't activated the app yet as it needs to be done within 24 hours. However the app has been sending her constant messages saying 'go home' 'you need to go home' 'you need to activate the app' etc... every 30 mins or soHaving installed the app, she went to a clinic for a test (not sure which one, cost 1800UAH) and the results may be available as early as this evening or tomorrow morning. This would mean a maximum of 12-24 hours in self-isolation.What is currently unclear is how the information on a negative test gets passed to the correct people. She spoke to the border control who said ask the police, she spoke to the police who said as the border control. She's since been told to go to a local police station and inform them. who knows!Anyway, will keep you all updated once she activates the app and/or gets the results."
Most of the clinics will report to the government . Here is the process: https://glavcom.ua/news/u-moz-poyasnili-yak-…
"Well i made it to Ukraine Kharkiv all ok, The border control at Kharkiv where good although English was a little broken.They asked for Insurance Documents, to see the app on phone, Ukraine phone number i will use and address of where i will be staying.There was no problems really. My girlfriend set the app up for me and i took the picture they wanted last night. This morning at 1042 they sent message asking for picture, it took 3 tries to get it to work, bit all ok in the end, Im just waiting see when they will message me again today.I am trying to find somewhere to get test done in Kharkiv at the moment.Edited: 6:11 am, July 07, 2020 "

"John S, are you waiting on test results ? Where are you in the pipeline ?"
thanks John the problem is that some clinics don't. And the time it takes for the system to get updated isn't clear. I think the issues for me appear as follows;1. How do you contact the Ministry of Digital Transformation if the clinic doesn't update?2. How long does it take to update the system?3. At what point are you deemed to be able to be free from self-isolation? is it the point of receiving a negtive test or of the system being updated? Surely in can't be incumbent upon the isolatee to ensure a swift administrative process.
"Hello Everyone,Just wanted to thank all the contributions on the thread. There's a lot of info and links provided. I myself need to travel from the UAE (classified as a red category country) to Kyiv for business for 5 days which will make it interesting. I plan to follow the footsteps that both John S and A K are doing. Arrive and try to immediate go to a clinic to get the PCR test done that same day in order to get have the quarantine lifted with 2 days if possible. If anyone knows a clinic that has a quicker turn around time on the results, I would greatly appreciate it."
just found an update also with 'authorised' places...https://phc.org.ua/news/algoritm-pripinennya…

"Awaiting test results ...... there are a number of false positives in PCR testing, IF someone tests positive I would suggest taking a second test to confirm"
"John S,Which clinic did you go to to get your PCR test done? Did anyone speak English?"
The difficulty is I am not sure you can travel for less than 14 days .... the potential quarantine period .... I would verify that first but I l do not think it s currently possible if you travel from a red country
"I used Adonis which was recommended to me by a very connected individual... they did not speak English, I had a friend on speaker phone to translate when I arrived ... it was no big issue"
"The testing facility has to do the update ... until the information is updated and accepted you are not ""free"" .... The testing facility takes down your passport number and you UKR phone number. That is how I believe they cross reference the results with the agency.Hopefully i will have the update on the finality of how it works by tomorrow."
"The testing facility has to do the update ... until the information is updated and accepted you are not ""free"" .... The testing facility takes down your passport number and you UKR phone number. That is how I believe they cross reference the results with the agency.As with many things in Ukraine, this is in flux. Those of us that have traveled to UKR a lot understand the process is a changing process in almost everythingHopefully i will have the update on the finality of how it works by tomorrow."
thanks John!
"John, i'm glad to see you got the test worked out.. and it will be an interesting experiment to see how long it will take for all the dots to connect. Yes being from Ukraine I know how the flux works but at least there's a path forward. I'll be anxious to see how you end up.I'm encouraged by the fact that the facilities seem to know this now.. as I called yesterday and even named the ministry incorrectly purposefully and the lady corrected me as to where it needs to be submitted.. so yeah.. seems like it may work out.Edited: 8:58 am, July 07, 2020 "
Thanks for the info on Khark8v airport and the list of Kharkiv clinics. Any idea of prices/time scales for the test?
"Prices i have relieved range between $50-150I suspect $50 will give you ""standard"" timeline if you pay a little more you can get it sooner."
"@John SWhen you arrived, did they ask you how long your stay in Ukraine would be? As you mentioned they might be an issue if I coming in for 5 days from a red category country. I will have a PCR in Dubai with results before I leave. I know it will not be accepted, but just added assurance that I am negative. I don't mind if my trip gets extended in Kyiv. Anyways, I always have a great time there as long as I am not quarantined for too long Just need to get back to work though."
"A.K,I would strongly recommend you check your ticket again. From what I've heard LOT is up to their old games again, which is to allow people to book flights, having already cancelled them (which is what happened to me). As far as I know, LOT is (currently) not flying out of the US until 18 August. And yes, your documents WILL be checked and if they're American, you WON'T be entering or transiting Poland.I would suggest, if they did that to you, that you do NOT accept the rebooking for the 30% discount code, which I did. Twice they sent me a code; twice, they didn't work. The whole airline is going through ""restructuring"" now (i.e., bankruptcy to emerge with a new name and not honoring past debts)Edited: 2:25 pm, July 07, 2020 "

"With too many uncertainties I cancelled my trip and now have credit to re-book with American Airlines any time within a year and a half.

"I was able to book a flight out of LAX through Amsterdam on August 1 using my Delta miles. I plan to stay about a month and I can use my miles to return also. Fully changeable flights and about $180 in fees each way. I plan to return end of August. Only about 45,000 miles each way. Before the pandemic I went to China 4 or so times a year so I have many Delta miles.I am fortunate that my job allows remote work although the time difference is not that convenient. I have not seen my GF for 8 months. It will be a working vacation if all goes well.I just hope the rules do not change for the worse!"

"test results back by the end of next day ... niw waiting for notification from Government I am 'Off app"""
"To update people... my gf went and had the test carried out straight after landing (so about 3pm on monday). She activated the app within 24 hours, and received her negative results at about 8pm local time last night. She received one message during that time.This morning she took her negative to the local police station and got them to update the system manually.Her post (if made public) is here: https:/…Will get the name of the testing place from her in a few minutes but seems very efficient. Under 36 hours from landing to results. Under 48 hours from landing to freedom, and less than 24 hours of 'self-isoaltion'.Edited: 5:25 am, July 08, 2020 "
test was carried out here: https://uniclinic.com.ua/cost was 1800uah
"I am being told the app updates at the end of the day .... I have received no requests for picture today but am playing in the safe side ... The story i we should be in isolation until officially notified by the app ..... since i do not speak Ukrainian, I am following that rule"
"@ John SIf you can John, would appreciate it you let us know when your negative results come through and the cancellation of your quarantine on the app. I saw an update from the YouTube channel A K sent previously, where she states some have had the test but they app did not cancel the quarantine. I hope it is just a bug that can be fixed or the clinic did not follow the process. Check the comments section of the YouTube videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUXonq0u_o0"
o will know by the morning the clinic sent me the following info ... that isolation is stopped at the end of the day when the software is updated .... I will know tomorrow or later tonight if it works
She's now published her article on the awfulness of the app... enjoy!https://medium.com/@Rommari/ukraines-act-at-home-app-or-50-shades-of-bureaucracy-hell-a25a6e7d654f
Great article Jezmyers. It doesn't in still much confidence in the system though.
"Sivota - absolutely not. It's clearly a shambles. i can imagine the police calling me, who doesn't speak Ukrainian, and trying to explain it to them. I suspect that i would be significantly less polite."
"Jezmyers, Thanks for your link to article from your GF.Why is anybody surprised ? The only people authorized to get quarantine lifted was the testing centre sending test results to ministry of health. These police and border guards know very little if anything.This is new and unchartered territory. It will take some time for all to understand new procedures"
"John, Hope all is well with you and you are able to move on from the app, let us know how it goes. I am scheduled to come in on Tuesday night and have a test scheduled on Wed morning."

"Hey John S, just wondering if you're off the App?Edited: 9:22 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Hi all,Just to share my personal experience. I arrived to Kyiv from UK last Sunday. Was made to install and activate Dii Vdoma app by the border officers, confirmed the location on arrival to my hotel I've pre-booked hotel visit from Dila laboratory for Monday morning, received negative test results by mid-day Tuesday, quarantine lifted early Wednesday 20hr to transfer data from lab to the app is slightly frustrating, but not a bad experience otherwise"
you'll all be glad to know that my gf is still getting messages (and ignoring them).
"not yet.... am told tomorrow (lol)As an aside, the bureaucrats in Ukraine stand on their own. The clerical staff is predominately useless and does as little as possible. Until that changes and heads roll and people actually work at their jobs, the country will not progress ....(JMO)"
"You've already had your spam deleted once, it's going to happen again."
"Brent - this information is already available on this thread. However, thank you for summarising it. If you making phone calls to the various Ministeries, perhaps you can ask why the UK remains in no man's land on the red/green list when the combined incidence of the UK countries as been well below 40 per 100000 for a number of weeks. Posdibly, this is an admin quirk because the data is represented as England, Scotland, Wales, N. Ireland rather than as UK. If so, then perhaps you could explain that they need to combine the data from each country. Getting some clarity on that would be really useful."
"Well, from reading the journalist's article, I see the USSR is alive and well, after all. Thank you to the contributor who mentioned www.dll.ua. I went to the site, let Google translate it, which it did unusually remarkably well, read the info about locations in the city I'm going to, about how to have a nurse meet me, etc. The website is incredibly detailed and clear. If you don't have a Ukrainian phone number, you can set up the appointment by email if you want a nurse visit. You will need to fill out a referral form online and email it to them, but you can Google translate that too and fill in the answers in Ukrainian.As for the rest, read Catch-22, learn to shrug your shoulder a lot and be able to laugh at yourself. They're on their own hamster wheel and really don't care whether you can balance yourself on it or fall off.Edited: 8:22 pm, July 09, 2020 "
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTB46FJOF5w .lol ...Ok so here was the problem, a transcription issue at the lab and they had inverted numbers. The office took care of the situation today and within 20 minutes I was off app and a real person again ....If ti hadnt been for that issue this would have been easy.The lab I used was Adonis https://adonis.com.ua/ . Very nice people and , as I said, when the issue came up they got to the bottom of the problem and fixed it. That is rare for Ukraine ... (I have to especially thank Julie in their back office)Off to explore the city I have grown to love .... one of the truly underappreciated cultures and cities of the world"
"The problem on mine was clerical .... when the lab sent the test results they had mis-entered the number. In most cases you would assume it would generate an error message when everything didn't match.After we found the problem it was 20 minutes and the app updated and sent me the ""freedom"" message. That part worked well.The app is still idiotic BUT if you do the test, its no big deal"
"Does anyone know if you can get through border control without a Ukrainian SIM card/number? I’d have to get a SIM card to to use the dii vdoma app, and I don’t know what my options are right now."
Border control will verify you've downloaded the app on your phone when you arrive (which you can do). You will need to buy a SIM between the border and your hotel(?) and then enter the information in Dii Vdoma so they can needlessly message and annoy you until you either bribe someone or get so drunk on vodka you won't care. OK?
"Hi this is Brent. I am British Turkish. I understand my first post getting deleted as it had links to my commercial products . I do not undestand, why my second one got deleted . It had no links or mentions to any commercial products or services. I believe it was a decent recapture of latest developments related to ukranian travel situation. It had also had information about the situation in the current location ( Berdyansk ) that I am staying. I will be reading this forum, and as a seasoned traveller last 6 years in almost every corner of Ukraine , I will try answering any questions with individual posts, if any . With my subjective opinion. Answering Sivota's question ; The situation in every ministery, that we speak , it is hard enough to find someone to give us the proper information , let alone reaching higher authorities. The situation is quiet new for them too. And there is some confusion in every party involved . Border Control , Local and Central police departments , Ministeries etc. I think it would be impossible for us, to reach the circles of people who are policy makers. But hey ' This is Ukraine' and I believe process will get eaiser with time. In my opinion not USA maybe , but soon UK will be in the green zone too. But if you thinking of visiting from UK and you do not want to pay this £45.00 £65.00 fee for a clinical test. Think of the reduced flight ticket prices right now. I was travelling for a one way ticket between £100-150 at high season between London - Kiev last year. Now I can get prices around even less than £50.00 . On top of that the accommodation prices are around 10-30% cheaper . If UK became a green zone country , it may not make much difference , as this might increase the flight prices. Ukraine is one of the least affected countries from Covid19 anyway . Also compared to holidaying in Spain for example you would only spend only, at worst, HALF of your budget here in UKRAINE. Especially Eastern Ukraine and the place I am at the moment . Latest Health Ministery reports say an increase rate of only 1-7% in hospitalization rates for surrounding regions of Berdyansk. So far, apart from grocery store and restaurant workers ( obligated by law) I have not seen any people with masks here in Berdyansk. It is like Covid 19 never arrived here . Full restaurants, bars and clubs . So I would say do not overthink things and start making your plans. Happy journey to all. Regards Brent"
They normally allow you around 12-24 hours to get a Ukrainian simcard and upload . But they are happier if you prebuy and give it to them
"I do not think bribing will work :) but taking an approved test will ! Which will be only few days, if you know how ."
"I'd love to pre-buy a card (especially from Kyivstar). Unfortunately, not available outside the country! :-("
People are wearing masks in places other than supermarkets and resturants. It's nonsense to suggest they're not. Claiming that to help your business won't work.
"Unfortunately, he's not wrong. Feel free to look at YouTube postings of the last few days in Kyiv. On the streets, almost no one has a mask and they ain't wearing them around their necks inbetween stops"
As i am under control of the APP how does it work if you go to the clinic for a test and they message you?? Do i take phone with me or just leave it at home and take the chance they will not write me while im out?
SimonYou have two options;1) go straight fro the airport to the clinic to have your test taken safe in the knowledge that you don't need to acivate the app for 24 hours from your arrival.2) you can travel 2km from your place of self-isolation and still be classed as 'at home'.I am hearing that things are slowly improving in terms of the tests/results/release from the app. I'm scheduled to fly out on the 31st July so we'll see but my gf is covering this extensively in the national press so.There's a big discussion on her Podcast on it from 17:30 https:/…
"We have friends that flew in from UK via Poland yesterday - they got straight through border control, no questions asked and not told to self isolate. I guess that border control are focussing on the direct flights but who knows. I still think It's important to have the app and be prepared to self isolate/get a test especially if you are coming from a high risk country/area e.g. USA/ Leicester UK. I personally would not want to put people at risk.Brent - thanks for your response."
"i am in central Kyiv and I will attest to the FACT that the vast majority (85% +) of people are NOT wearing masks while on Kreshatyk and walking around town.When required in stores and supermarkets , yes ... but only in places where required.(BTW the muzzles are useless against a virus)Edited: 8:39 am, July 11, 2020 "
I took my phone with me and they buzzed while I was out ... no big deal just respond as soon as you get back and document ... where you located ...PM me
High risk country and putting others at risk .... lol ... you really do not understand this virus
"I have made a few videos of Berdyansk. I am not providing links, because it might be against forum rules. In those you will see thousands of people in the background not wearing masks. There are a few exceptions surely. Because they are so rare, I stopped and asked these two 20 year old males why they are wearing masks. They said they are making a statement:) (I do not know know whether fashion statement or anarchist statement) . The only place in Berdyansk that people have to wear a mask is when they supermarket shopping at the moment. Even in minibuses in town people stopped wearing them.  2 months ago in Dnipro 50 to 80% of people were wearing masks walking in the streets. And 100% of the people had to to wear mask in shops and public buses etc. To answer snukr , I am only passing on what I see in the streets , how can I be passing on such false information to sell something? Also do you have a problem with people making an honest business and service ? This is the third time you now write back to my posts negatively. You were right on my first post, but I believe not on the rest . It was Friday night last night. All the 3 busiest bar club places in Berdyansk was full to every table. LOTS of people dancing on the dance floor not a single person with mask to be seen. I believe soon, even in Kiev they will be opening summer clubs around HYDRO PARK . Although KIEV and some parts of Western Ukraine are the worst affected places in Ukraine.  With hospitilazation rate increases of 30-65 % at some previous weeks. But situation I believe will probably improve . I will be monitoring the situation,  just like anybody else. And hopefully pass on the latest news , maybe here or on my website / YouTube chanell Regards BRENT"
"BrentI see that as an honest opinion.My wife has spoken to her family in the South and it seems that wearing a mask has seemed somewhat of a novelty. Almost ""It won't happen to us"" syndrome. Almost like the UK with a lot of people.My own opinion is that many have not been caught up in any serious way with this pandemic and whereas the Government and Border Controls are taking it seriously many are not.As a side issue do be careful of even mentioning anything as per your last sentence of having a website/You tube channel as this may easily be construed as self solicitation.Edited: 10:17 am, July 11, 2020 "
"John, I think what most people do not understand is that the mask is not being worn to protect YOU, but others, by limiting how far spittle can travel. If others around you aren't wearing a mask, no, yours won't protect you. The idea is to be ""socially conscious"" in protecting others and hope they'll do the same (which in the US, is like asking a dog to sit in front of a bowl of food and not go near it for 30 minutes. Good luck on that!). I will be spending most of my time at abandoned synagogues and graveyards and other ruins, so my time around people will be very limited (rental car). Still, mask and IPod-friendly gloves for the other times. Can't end my life because I may die tomorrow, can I?"
"I live in Washington State. Masks are mandatory, and 99% of people wear them when indoors in stores and such. They are not required when outside and able to socially distance. Sadly though, most people not wearing masks seem to be hispanic ... and they tend to be the most at risk population. Not all masks are equal, but they roughly reduce the spread by 50%. If an infected person infects 2 others this is exponential growth. But if on the average only 1 other the percentage infected will be flat. So they can make a difference but are not fool proof of course. I dread wearing masks on all the flights though. I like splash shields better, but they are not generally accepted as a mask alternative. I am not particularly worried about getting covid in Ukraine but the flight has risks.I have booked arrangements to arrive August 2 and stay for the month. I will work remotely about half time.The information on this forum has been very helpful to set my mind at ease ... knock on wood nothing changes!I hope all countries are more successful at getting this virus contained."
"actually the scientific studies show you are incorrect ... I know the propaganda about protecting each other ... is that why in 2019 both the CD and WHO said maskes were useless and the UK , a month ago int heir directive about opening businesses said the same thing,https://evidencenotfear.com/tag/face-masks/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/med… page 35https://www.sott.net/article/434796-The-Scie…"
"Actually, I agree with you completely and have always said as much. And while I happen to be in the high risk group, I firmly believe this will not end until we let the virus take it's course. But remember, this is the US, where BLM and their Leftist sheep are running amok and attempting to bring about the 21st century version of the Terror of pre-Napoleonic France. As long as the majority allows them free run, your life and livelihood are in more danger from them than a room full of rodents carrying plague fleas. Now whip yourself twenty times, say fifty hail Marys, burn your well poisoning neighbors and put the mask on!Oh, and to keep this travel related, should I bring a hoodie for the nights in places other than Odesa or is it way too warm for that?Edited: 7:12 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"Whilst I don't think this is place for an argument on PPE, as someone with a doctorate in biomedical sciences and getting onto 40 yrs in public health , here are my thoughts, which are evidence based not social media based:Wearing face masks/coverings are the lowest form of protection. In the hierarchy of control, isolation, social distancing and behavioural change are the game changers. Oh and not moving from country to country if you can avoid it but can fully appreciate why people want to. So here is my starter for 10.Face mask design has to comply with international standards I.e, they have to do what it says on the tin.For face masks to work as designed they have to be face fitted (nearly killed me kast time I did it - read out a poem after 20 mins of steps) and be worn properly. Beards are 100% out as are not fitting the straps tight enough to get the correct suction, wearing under your nose or over your glasses. Let's not even go there for for under your chin or wearing as a head band.Advice from WHO that is a month old is a month old. Convention back then was that face coverings do nothing to protect you, but may protect others from you but only if used properly.This has changed - - if worn properly and are of 'good' design they reduce emmisions from you. So if everyone wears one, then everyone benefits.There are no design standards for face coverings - some are better than others. Some are useless.Again, they need to be worn properly. Shave off those beards.Well yeah probably repeated myself a few times there but the point is that most people on this thread want to comply with the somewhat bizarre regulations, which in almost every county stem from being under prepared. The UK is no better. They will all take timd to bed in. Being aware of the incidence of where you come from is vital as is taking precautions. Also remember the antigen test is only good for the day the you take it. It tells you nothing about the subsequent days. So you can arrive, have the test, be negative and 2 days later be infectio6s."
Face masks useles?!?!? But what about my doctor buying that all-over body robe with the bird's beak and pointed hat?
the plague doctor ....... https:/…
Well I am glad the app works when the negative results are uploaded and those of you who were in quarantine are free. I guess the best way to be free from the app is to immediately to go to a clinic upon arrival (if you can) and get the test done so the amount of time in quarantined will be limited. Thanks for sharing
OK am relating what our friend experienced 4 days ago at Boryspil airport. UK passport holder.She said the staff at Border Control were extremely helpful.Helped her download the aforementioned app and load it up.Told her she had 2 options.1) To self quarantine at her son's address for 14 days and regular checks on her phone to see she was complying.2) To get tested at a clinic that the airport were working with and recommended.Cost of Doctor UAH 600 and cost of test UAH 1700.She was in there maximum 30 minutesShe opted for this and within 3 days was notified on her phone that she was clear.Don't know the name of the clinic but her son drove her there.Guess for anyone else it would be a taxi to the clinic and in my wife's case (if we opted for this) another taxi to the train station.Does anyone know of a clinic in a more central part of Kyiv?
"Yes, very good, John: the plague doctor.UAH 2300 seems about ... right. Though, as I said, you can do a PCR at home with a nurse for UAH 1800 with dll.ua. You can even set up an appointment beforehand via email, if you know where you'll be and at what time. For those not in the know, please be advised that you can download the DII VDOMA app BEFORE showing up in Ukraine; you just won't be able to activate it until you get there (unless you have a Ukrainian number, that is)."
"Adonis Clinic did mine and where very helpful .... sounds like somone is getting a kickback on the ""official airport clinic"" ...lol"
"""Adonis""?!? If it weren't for Ukrainians' general disregard of homosexuality, I would say this sounds like a place where the male nurse might ask you out for a date afterward! :-)"

Totally confused over the quarantine. Is it possible to leave the place of quarantine as long as you stay within 2km? Do you have to have someone with you?

"Came into Ukraine yesterday at 5pm, went through the app got it activated at the border. Did a test in Vinnitza at Medilabs this morning at 8am and then made my way to the address where I was to ""self isolate"" checked in at 3pm about two hours shy of the 24 hrs limit you have to get to your place of isolation and check in the app, then 30 min later medilabs sent me results and I refreshed the app it said I was out of quarantine. So basically total time was about 30 minutes.. yeah its a waste of money and yeah someone is going to be making money on these tests.. but other than that.. not a big dealEdited: 9:23 am, July 15, 2020 "
"Ukraine has increased 40 active cases per 100.000 rule to 55 today. This might get UK , SPAIN & Sweden off the RED ZONE list. Watching out for the release of latest RED/GREEN zone list. And soon France and Canada. USA not likely at the moment. For people coming from USA, there are other ways too. Contact me , if interested . Also do not make a big deal out of the PCR clinic test either . It is a straight forward process. Brent"
"A K . Which country you transited from ? Did they ask about it, with passport stamps ? Or you could have easily declared that you stayed in that country for last 2 weeks ?"
"I came from USA via Frankfurt. They asked where I came from and where I transited looked through stamps but either way USA is a red country so they had to put me on the app.I didn’t try to do anything shady because frankly this app is the only sensible thing I see the government do here in years. Yes it’s annoying yes it’s a waste of 50$ on a test etc but at least there’s a way to do it. Unlike Thailand for example, etc. so I think you all should just look at the info on this thread and our experiences and try to follow this best you can.Edited: 1:36 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"The latest, sort of .... Moves are underway to have testing set up at KBP and LWO so people can get tested upon arrival and, if negative, not go into isolation at all. I'm curious to see how quickly the tests can be done, as local labs claim results outside of kyiv can take up to 78 hours to get!"
"Today I tried to travel to Ukraine. My flight route was supposed to be Dallas to Paris and from Paris to Prague and from there to Odessa. But when I tried to check in at the airport I wasn't able to check in because supposedly there was an issue about me traveling from Paris to Prague even though I was just transiting. So, I'm not sure what to do about it since there isn't many choices about routes from my location."
"You can go the same way I'm going: PHX to JFK to IST to LWO, return ODS to IST and so on. Jet blue connecting to Turkish airlines"
"> I'm curious to see how quickly the tests can be done, as local >labs claim results outside of kyiv can take up to 78 hours to get!Most of those 72 h declared by labs is the time reserve for transportation the sample to other bigger lab and other time reserve for possible waiting line. Also lab іutilize previously existed equipment for PСR tests which often is not the fastest.I have no idea which equipment they'll buy for airports, but it's possible to choose equipment which will give results in less than 3 hours."
"Why would you want to do a test in airport anyway. Arrive, book a test for same/next day. Results same or next day. Respond to relevant authority. Get released from the app and restrictions. Alltogether 1-2 days. You can find it cheaper outside. Close to city center rather than farout airports. If anything happens and you need to go back. Also what happens , if you test positive (or false positive ) . You will be sharing sensitive information with a government agency needlessly. Have you tried going through Ireland or Turkey from Paris ? Dublin Kiev flights are real cheap on Ryan air at the moment. Thanks for the reply A K. So they do check stamps for US travellers . It is easy for Europeans if travelling or transiting from a green zone . As there are hardly any stamps between them ."
"We have at least 5 -6 cities , outside Kiev, and private clinics giving results in 12-24 hours. Also we refer to the cheapest and more suitable clinic. This 78 hours result must be real small towns or that particular lab with less facility. People think an airport , even assuming they work 24/7 , they give the result straight away. They probably will not work 24/7 . Plus it is likely they will respond result in around a day. Or Monday if it is done on a weekend. Ukranians do not like working in the weekends , especially in summer :) You still have to upload Dii Vdoma App and report for that time period. Not 100% sure , but we will see how it goes. This is Ukraine :)"
"In Vinnitza Medilabs did test at 8am result was ready at 3pm test was 1500 hryvnya and they uploaded everything to the app by 5pm. Overall if one plans the trip out and makes reasonable accommodations and time expectations things will be ok. Some of the comments on here about this and that reflect more on the traveler than Ukraine. Of course if you try to fly to Ukraine with a dozen stops in between just to get a best deal it’s not going to work. Cmon people it is a pandemic time, real or imaginary pandemic no the less. Ukraine is not that big one can find reasonable single transfer in Europe to Kiev and then deal with the app stuff and continue on no need to try to fly directly into a smaller airport. Not that big of a deal. Yes you will pay more yes it’s a waste of couple of days but that’s the price you pay. If you can’t do it you can’t do it.Edited: 5:50 am, July 16, 2020 "
LOT has resumed flights from Warsaw to Odesa.https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/306…
Oddly UIA seem to be one of the last to fly into Odesa.
"If you scroll down the page of the link I provided it says there also now LOT flights from Warsaw to Lviv, but those flights aren't yet available to tourists."
"Hi guys, thanks for all the info on this thread, have found it very useful and obviously things are changing by the day. Here's my issue:I am doing some European travelling until Christmas. I am from the UK and my initial route is from 25/7 France, Switzerland, Austria, Czech, Poland and then Ukraine (Kiev) before travelling to Belarus where I will be staying for a month. I will have travelled nearly three weeks in what are currently five green zone countries before arriving in Kiev (by train). As it stands (and for clarity), I believe I still need the following:1. The App2. A test3. To self isolate until the test has been ok'd as negative and the app cleared, which could be two days. My plan was to go to Chernobyl, so I'm assuming that if all is well, I shouldn't book a trip for at least two days after arrival.Can somebody confirm the above please.Also, in Belarus, Ukraine is seen as a red zone country (I appreciate this is the Ukraine forum and not the Belarus forum) and so I would have to self-isolate for two weeks and equally if I returned home to the UK. So my question here is, how are things currently in Ukraine? Are things so bad that moving from red to green is unlikely in the next month, or are things improving? For me personally, the issue seems to be getting out rather than getting in!"
"P2gotv .. I'm not overly concerned with sharing my results with a government which loses all control over me once I leave. And, positive or negative, they're informed anyhow. In the US, I'd be more likely to trust a government agency than a private business who's computer security is questionable at best. As for your assumption about time, I have yet to find one lab in lviv which promises less than a 54 he return, truthfully or not"
"To Paul y. First of all, in less than a couple of weeks, I expect UK to be in Green zone. But it is not your citizenship / residency that counts . But the place where you stayed last 2 weeks. I have done the route from UK to Ukraine a few times by car. They do not stamp your passport till polish border. Entering ukraine. Maybe also in Switzerland , as they have slight different schengen rules. Both France and Czechia is in red zone right now. Coming from Poland , all you have to say is that after France you spend 2 weeks in switzerland /Austria / Germany / Poland . And you will not need the app or the test . All you need is a cheap covid19 insurance. 10-20 € You will be fine to go anywhere in Ukraine ."

"A government keeps records and can even inform your own government , if she wants. A private business in UK for example has to abide by the data protection act . And will never release this info. Or they could face a big compensation. A respected or even an average business only keep records for commercial purposes , such as an email list to sell or newsletter. Under no obligation to release any data. Such as client privacy privileges. Even to the police , unless a criminal case has opened. Even in those cases a court order might be necessary. It is your constitutional right not to release any illness of yourself to any authority. Even hospitals do not have the right to disclose any individual records to any other goverment agency. They can only compile a collected record and statistics for their own training/planning needs. You can only be subjected to a case , if a criminal situation arises. A clinic ( public or private ) has to get your consent to release the results to the suitable government agency By taking a quick test in an airport and signing a consent form . Your result gets automatically sent to the relevant government agency. What if you get a positive , even worse a false positive , result. That could stay in a government record for a while!!! I personally, any given day , would trust any respected business enterprise a lot more than a government agency."

"Anyone knows test sites/laboratories in Odessa? Any recent travelers to Odessa feedback, especially from red zones?"
"I'm looking into staying with my girlfriend in Kiev. She's a resident working remotely. This thread has been quite useful, but there are some things I'm unclear on.Can I quarantine at her place, which is a one-bedroom apartment? During that time, she would stick to the same rules as someone under quarantine.Or do I need to stay at a hotel? What is the process of finding a hotel to self-quarantine in?It seems it will be pretty tough not speaking Ukranian.I understand that people have had used with flight cancellations, especially from LOT. Are any airlines particularly reliable?"
"Yes you can quarantine in her apartment All they are looking for at the border is an address they can care less what it is. I’d suggest you spend the $50 on a test though. Lufthansa and Turkish air have been the most reliable as they had basically zero cancelations in the last couple of weeks. Out of Chicago at least.Edited: 4:51 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Well, I think I’ll finally try and make the trip again next week if there is testing available at KBP.Could someone who has used the app tell me what time at night the last message is sent?Thanks in advance."

Ukraine has extended it's quarantine until 31st August.

"It seems to be hit and miss as to whether they follow the rules. Someone just reported going to KBP via FRA, Americans and not on essential travel. Also supposed to be banned"
I came through Frankfurt no one checks anything. You can’t enter Germany as an American unless essential but transiting doesn’t count.
"Doing the Chicago-Frankfurt-Kiev trip today. Remember to have COVID insurance as well. They checked mine in Chicago before I boarded. I got a policy on the visitukraine.today website that is linked from the US embassy site. If anyone has English instructions for the DII Vdoma app, that would be greatly appreciated. Safe travels all !"
"Paris to Prague is within the EU, which is why you were denied. If you fly Dallas-Houston-Frankfurt-Kiev you are OK because you never enter the EU in Frankfurt. Both the US and Ukraine are non-schengen."

This application screen you need to show to State Border Guard Service officer.You need to confirm your arrival at self-isolation place, as your location is recorded when you send photo. It should be the same as the one you specified when logging into mobile app.Of course, you won't have (I assume) a Ukrainian cell number before you get there, but you have 24 hours to get one and register. I can't remember where I saw the information, but I believe you will have to take four pictures of yourself: straight on; from below; to the left; the right. They can (will) call you between 0900 and 2100.On the other hand, if you are flying to KBP (or maybe LWO), they are supposed to set up testing right at the airport which will not only save you the time to find a clinic, but is supposed to come back with results faster. Cost, I don't know. The PCR test in clinics seem to range for 1500 to 2300 hryven"
"@Scott H, let us know how it goes man! Thanks in advance for reporting back."
"Jez - that’s good I’m sure I will see you on the flight in that case! I have lots of time before my flight to Kharkiv so plan to get the test done at KBP. After working everything out it seems like the cheapest and least complicated way of doing things.I don’t know if it has been posted here as I’ve missed a few posts whilst I decided not to travel and now to travel again, but if anyone has a quite new phone you can buy a Ukraniam e-sim from lifecell either through the app or on the website.Looks easy enough to set up."
"I've seen ways to buy a Ukrainian SIM here in the States, but they cost significantly (ie, obnoxiously) more expensive than waiting to, say, buy Kyivstar once you land.Well, another day, another drama: I found out last night that my flight from Istanbul to Lviv on Turkish Airlines was cancelled and has to refund my ticket. This is the THIRD time, from my original flight in May on Condor; to the August flight on Condor being cancelled; and now this. So, now it's off on LOT via JFK going and returning via ORD. I am betting on nothing, however, since this is booking number four in less than six months! My calendar looks like someone spilled black ink all over it from the changing it multiple times.Anyhow, outside of whining, I wanted to give a heads up to anyone booked on Turkish Airlines to CHECK your reservation with them. My flight is (was) some three weeks ahead and neither they nor JetBlue, the outbound carrier and the one responsible to advise of schedule changes, let me know about it. Only when I tried to sign in and got an error message did I (correctly) assume the worst.Lyndon, if rumors turn out to be true, you won't even have to leave KBP to get your test done!Edited: 2:24 pm, July 24, 2020 "
lyndon - wonderful stuff.drop me a line jezmyers at hotmail dot comif you are getting a test done near the airport then i might get mine done at the same time.
"Jez - will drop you a line.Yes, you can now book the test at KBP airport (I believe the testing centre is in Terminal B can be booked online).I saw the links yesterday and will post them tomorrow if it’s useful for people. I read that the cost is around 50 USD and results are sent within 24 hours by email and also to the ministry of health."
"Lyndon- my son flew direct to Kharkiv and out of the 5 clinics on the official list there were only 2 that were actually offering the test. The first - Millenium had a 1 month waiting list for appointments so he had to go to the other more expensive one. He had the test on the Tues but didn't get off the app until the following Monday, so get it done in Kiev if you can. He did say that you get a hour to respond to the photo request before you fail."
Google translate of the app Q&A above. Hope it's some use.
"Well, appreciate the detailed instructions, but to someone not following closely, it gives the impression that if you show up at the border with no Ukrainian phone number (ie, SIM), you will be forcibly conveyed to a hospital, since you have no way of activating the app in the border guard's presence.Edited: 9:49 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"Thanks Sivota,Yes I’ll be getting it done at KBP as I’ll have time before a layover flight. I think it states 6-12 hours from that facility."
Did anyone actually take the test in KBP airport? Is testing place open 24 hours? Now long does it take to get the results from testing in KBP? Anyone has personal experience with this? Thanks.
"Hi Yuri,It’s 24/7. The link to register and pay is here:https://testcovid19.com.ua/"
"Hey Taurean,Wondering how did you trip go? Particularly the customs: the mandatory app requires local cell number in order to get sms and confirm.. how did you get local sim? Were you asked proof of medical insurance? We’re you checked for temperature, etc? Did you have to take COVID test once you reached your destination?I’m planing a trip in early September, thus all the questions. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
HI there KalebIt's my wife who is travelling not me.Her flights have been cancelled around 3 times but she is due to travel August 4.
"Remember, the link provided for airport testing is for a private company only serving KBP and ODS"
"My experience with the Dii Vdoma app: I arrived in Odessa at 6:30 pm on a LOT flight from Warsaw. I had previously downloaded the app from Google Play, but had not opened it. I also had a copy of my insurance form, which was checked. I did not have a Ukrainian sim card. The agent told me to wait, then after a few minutes, took me to a kiosk located in the same room on the other side of the checkpoint. There I purchased a sim (from Lifecell) and changed some money to pay for a taxi. It was not expensive. At that point the agent gave me back my passport and I took a taxi to my apartment. I had previously set up an appointment at 9:00am the next morning for a Covid test at the Americam Medical Center at 2 Frantsuz'Ky Blvd. That was $125, a bit high, but they speak English. I then stocked up on groceries, went to the apartment, installed the sim and opened the app and filled out the information with the help of Google Translate camera mode. This should be done within 24 hours of your arrival. The app asked for several picture angles and this was confusing at first. It buzzes when it's not happy. I don't understand Ukrainian, but if you just tilt and move your head in the same way as the animated face on the screen, the app will finally come up with a (horribly unflattering) picture. The black button below sends the picture along with you geo-location info. The app then requested additional photos 3 times the next day, at 10, 1:30pm and 7:30pm. The following day the times were similar. Note there is a black bar on the bottom of the app with ""103"" in parentheses. Don't push that, it's to call an ambulance. The negative lab results were ready on Friday morning, and the lab sent the results to the app admin. By Friday at 7pm the app sent me a green check mark, meaning I've cleared quarantine. However, I'm meant to leave the app installed throughout my stay. Altogether a pretty painless experience, although if I were to do it all again I might use a cheaper lab like Medilabs. Odessa is a nice town!Edited: 8:15 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Thank you for making the effort to tell exactly what you went through. My only surprise was, based on the comment I left in a thread about the test, supposedly, you could have done it right at the airport for 1500 гр, takes 15 minutes and results usually come back within six hours. However, unlike you, I'm not there so you would know better the realities on the ground"
"Thank you Lyndon, I live in US and my trip to Ukraine is entirely discretional as I want to visit my elderly parents in Kiev. I still have some reservations. Why the website to register for a test at KBP is not widely available in the airport website, or on the site of US Embassy in Kiev? Also as most americans I work, I can only take a short vacation, and can visit Kiev for not more than 10 days. Is there a guarantee that this system will work? What if the test results will not be loaded by then? Will I be able to board the plane after 10 days back to the US (in the case there is a screw up in the communications with this app and that will be below 14 days) as I am a US citizen? I am sure I am not the only one who wants to have answers to these questions. Thank you."
"@Longest_Screen_Name: wow, your comment is priceless! one super important question though: you said you installed and activated SIM (local number) only after you got to your apartment? so the customs let you in without checking the app activation on your phone? thanks!K."

"As stated earlier, and confirmed by others who've been there, you are NOT required to have a Ukrainian phone number before you get there --- and, in fact, to my knowledge, NONE of the four major providers in Ukraine will send you one overseas. You ARE required to have DII VOMA on your phone when you get there. A previous poster has stated the border guard took him to a kiosk in the airport to get a SIM on the spot. That's great. But if that doesn't happen, it is my understanding you have 24 hours to sign into DII VOMA and provide your number and location. The border guards won't be all that concerned: if you don't do so, their computer system, in theory, should detect that when you try to leave and they will fine you. Also, to the best of my knowledge, if you attempt to leave Ukraine prior to the 14 day quarantine, if you have to be in quarantine, you will be fined also. Thus, a 10 day vacation may not be feasible if you suspect you will end up being in quarantine for whatever reason (and bear in mind, it's a risk, because you may contract something within days of leaving and not know it)."
"@typicallyarrogant: your speculations are not helpful. this is what it says on their official site: https://visitukraine.today under the App Description: (read #3):How to log into mobile app?1. Enter Ukrainian mobile phone number, confirm registration with the code received to mentioned phone number,2. Fill in data on location of self-isolation place;3. After filling in data on self-isolation place, the screen ""Are you already at the self-isolation /observation place?"" will open. This application screen you need to show to State Border Guard Service officer.4. You need to confirm your arrival at self-isolation place, as your location is recorded when you send photo. It should be the same as the one you specified when logging into mobile app."
"You may believe what you wish. By your interpretation, only those who have physically been in Ukraine and have an active SIM would this be able to enter the country. Since people on here have stated clearly that they have not had such and I have friend who entered three days ago and doesn't have one, obviously, they are all lying and secretly writing comments here from their living rooms in Odessa, Texas.Edited: 2:41 am, July 26, 2020 "
"Is there actually anyone who took a test in KBP airport and can say how long to took to get out of self isolation after the test in KBP airport? Additionally the official site shows many places in Kiev to take a test, but none of them have phone #, addresses or hours of operation. Any experience with these mentioned places? https://www.phc.org.ua/news/algoritm-pripine…Thanks.Edited: 9:39 am, July 26, 2020 "
"I hope to see more information here, as I am planning to visit in the end of August. The FB post about testing at point 48 is not available on fast line site at all, it is only a FB post. The other site proposed here:https://testcovid19.com.ua/not mentioned anywhere else, and this is a private company, who knows if they are for real. The testing places in Kiev mentioned on the official site do not have phone #. addresses or times of operation. So where is a guarantee, when I arrive to KBP airport there would be a reliable and verifiable way to get out a self isolation, or a reliable test site, where I would be able to call and verify that they transmitted the test to the government of Ukraine? To what I see with the information I have here and other sites there is none."
"There have to be official government testing sites, at least in the main Ukraine international airport (KBP), with clear description and prices, and the number where to call and ask questions. As it is in Germany for example. Short of that no discretional traveller will visit Ukraine."
"@kaleb: Yes the agent let me pass after purchasing a sim and merely showing him the Dii Vdoma app icon on my home screen. It's probable he copied down my new sim number into his records, but I did not see him do it. Your mileage may vary. As to others who asked, yes I did see a testing center after I cleared customs and entered the main arrivals area in Odessa. It was closed at the time (7:00pm). Finally, I don't believe it's possible to enter Ukraine (from a Red Zone country) for a stay shorter than the quarantine period (currently 14 days). If you were to test positive then you would become a real problem. I had myself tested in the States one week before my departure date to make sure I was clean and I would strongly recommend doing that. I ended up showing those results to several airline staff on the way and it made things easier. Good luck all and stay safe."
"Hi all, I have reviewed the thread and think that what I am to ask hasn't been covered. We are two Spanish people traveling to Belarus from Spain. We have a long transfer in Kiev (over 18 hours) and we wanted to know if we can leave the Boryspil airport and visiting the city without restrictions if we are leaving the country in less than 24 hours, which is indeed the time we would have to activate the Act at home app. Thank you so much"
"There seems to be a new regulation effective Saturday, allowing people to be free from self-isolation if they passed a PCR test 48 hours prior to crossing the border. ""Also, a person can be free from self-isolation in Ukraine in case he/she has a negative test result for Covid-19 by PCR, which was passed no later than 48 hours before crossing the Ukrainian border (starting from 1/08/2020). "" https://www.visitukraine.today/ This may be easier than getting tested in Ukraine, but is there any source of information about what kind of documentation they will need?"
"hi Gonzalo: here's what it says on KBP website (https://kbp.aero/en/covid-19/): During transit, those persons who leave the borders of Ukraine within two days are not subject to observation or two-week self-isolation. Relevant changes were made by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in the Resolution of No. 392 dated 20 May 2020.In addition, the amendments stipulate that border service does not allow foreigners and persons without citizenship (except for foreigners, persons without citizenship with permanent residence in Ukraine and persons recognized as refugees or persons in need of an additional protection) to cross the state border of Ukraine without the relevant policy (certificate) of insurance for costs associated with the treatment of COVID-19, observation.so it sounds like you're gonna be fine! just make sure to get insurance at https://www.visitukraine.todaysafe travels!Edited: 5:40 pm, July 28, 2020 "

"And then promptly pay a $1000+ fine when you leave Ukraine, because your passport information is linked to DII Vdoma by border security and when, upon exiting, it shows you haven't quarantined, you can give them this fool's address to pay the fine for you"
"Also in terms of us living in the US the option of 48 hours of foreign test is useless. My state of OH is in the middle in terms of contamination. I inquired today, if I do not have any symptoms , how long it will take to get results. The answer was 6-10 days. There are not even commercial options where you pay for faster results."
Does anyone have any information on flying to Ukraine without a Ukrainian sim card to activate the DII VDOMA app?

"I agree, but you can alway think of a smart lie. *reply to: typicallyarroganttripadvuser"
"I really do not understand why you would think of ""a smart lie"". The entire process is there to prevent this Covid 19 from spreading. I think it is everyone's responsibility to try this as much as possible. I am working in Kharkiv, Dutch myself. When I came to Ukraine, the Netherlands were red zone. By now it's green zone. I was in self quarantine for two weeks. Or you follow the rules or you stay home. I looked on the site of Kharkiv airport and there is a testing facility on the airport. You download the app, do the test and if you're ok, you'll get the result in 24 hours. Also the app is informed and you're free to move around."
"I'd like to remind people of something brought up earlier: if you have an (expensive) phone or iPad, which is capable, you can buy an esim online from Vodafone or Lifecell (surprisingly, not kyivstar). I don't have a $1200 phone, but I needed to replace my iPad and bought an Apple Air 3 for a big discount. With the iPad, you can buy the esim, download Skype or a number of programs where you can make phone calls over data lines, and have your Vii Domain and Ukrainian SIM and phone number before arriving. Since I spend the entire time driving, it's not so ridiculous for me, since I otherwise never use a cell phone (which I'll probably leave home). It'll feel a bit ridiculous pulling out an iPad at border control, but it'll be worth it to have the number ahead of time and a big screen for Google maps."
"I think that post # 357 is very arrogant and irresponsible. Surely the attitude should be lets beat this and do as is required rather than ""lets lie to the system because I will be okay and don't want to bother with all this cr*p""Ukraine health services are struggling anyway without the attitudes of people like this"

"And travel around and infect people around you, because you only have two weeks in Ukraine?? I don't know if you're just that stupid or that you are just trying to be funny here. I hope it's the last. But if so, you are failing in this miserably. I also don't understand why your post isn't removed. If one looks at a post being inappropriate, I think this falls into that catagory."
"Anyone entering Ukraine will be allowing for an extra 2 weeks in case they have to quarantine for the full 14 days, no one is going to go to Ukraine for 2 weeks to spend it all in quarantine. Anyone travelling from the UK needs to spend 14 days in quarantine on their return. People travelling to Ukraine at this time need to have a lot of spare time."
Did you make it to Ukraine? I'm planning to go in a few weeks but can't find a SIM before arriving for the Dii Vdoma tracking app. Do you know if they allow arrivals to buy a SIM at the airport after going through immigration?
"yes.you install the app via wifi, show it to border staff, show it to passport staff then go and get one once they let you through. As they have the address you are staying at, and your passport details, it is incumbent on you to comply."
The UK is now in the green zone. UK citizens no longer need to quarantine in Ukraine. Some countries which were in the green zone are now in the red zone.https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-society/307…
Could someone please explain the algorithm they are using now to determine which countries are red and which one are green?
"It's the number of cases per 100,000 citizens."
">>> It's the number of cases per 100,000 citizens.There is more to it than just # of cases per 100,000. Plenty of countries with lower amounts than Ukraine.I think that is what the question from #368.That last column in table of red/green zone may have something to do with it.Edited: 1:19 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"It's the number of cases per 100,000 in the last 14 days. The last column is the increment. There are currently 66 countries in the green zone."
"Effective today, 01 August, there are two things you may want to know:1. The number of cases per 100,000 to get out of the red zone has dropped from 44 to 24 (i.e., it'll be harder to clear restrictions);2. Ukraine will now be divided into four zones: Red, Yellow, Orange and Green. This is based on their own number of cases in a region and how many ICU beds are occupied. Each level has its own restrictions with the next ""dangerous"" level incorporating the levels' restrictions below it and their own.If you are especially dependent on public transport or socializing during your trip, you may want to go online and reads what restrictions you may be facing upon arrival."
"It is hard to understand at all. The situation in Australia and Spain (both in red) is much batter than in UK (now in green) for example. On the other hand ""active cases"" is a wrong measure too as some countries only testing sick people, while the others tracing and find a lot of cases without symptoms, I just hope that there will be well defined procedure with the test in the airport, and verifiable guarantee that if it is negative isolation will be over..."
"My speculation is that Ukraine is working towards reciprocity, it might be because now they use multiple parameters, so they will have an easy reason to allow citizens of countries who allow ukrainians. Another thing I found Austria and Germany. Those arguable the best countries in Europe in that respect are in the red list. I think this is a conformation of my hypothesis."
I used the app for last message i got was at 21:37 on the one Saturday night.
Cases in Spain and Germany are rising at this time. The UK government has ordered anyone arriving in the UK from Spain must quarantine for 14 days. This has affected a lot of people as Spain is the most popular destination for UK tourists.
I'm to trying to understand about the PCR test in a foreign country max. 48 hours upon arrival. I'm planning to do such a test because I need to be in Lviv for 4 days but nobody in Ukraine knows where I should show the non-covid declaration to avoid Self quarantine and any other troubles... Does anybody have an answer for me?
"NEWS FROM POLAND:Due to an increased spike in the country, Ukraine is in the process of re-adding Poland back to the red zone countries. As a result, it is very possible flights from Poland to Ukraine and vice versa might be affected. On the other hand, there are (were?) many Ukrainians in Poland working, so they might keep them running for their sake.If you have a ticket booked through LOT (as I do), you should keep a close eye on this as they have been regularly canceling flights (like my return in October). Understand that, currently, if you ask for a refund, there are MANY customers who had flights in March and April who have NOT gotten their money back yet."
"I entered Ukraine on July 9th from Poland, by car, no problems at all. The only thing you need is your health insurance card or certifate. Nobody asked for any app on the mobile phone. I am still in Ukraine and i will leave the country in about 10 days."
"This is August, not July. And they're talking on both sides about closing the borders. Especially to vehicle and foot crossings"

"Ukraine compares number of active cases per 100'000 inhabitants - as the number has dropped in Ukraine but still increased in other countries, the number of red listed countries increased.

"Trying to do the PCR test in the USA within 48hrs as well, not sure if they will accept it in Ukraine though.Edited: 9:22 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"As of 01 August, you can present confirmation of a negative test conducted within the 48 hour period before arriving in Ukraine to avoid another PCR test and/or isolation. Please note that, regardless of the result, ALL visitors (even from the so-called Green Zone) MUST have a medical insurance policy upon entry."
"Does anyone know how exactly the 48hr PCR test process works? After showing the appropriate documents to them, will they automatically take you off the quarantine with no wait or do you still have to go through the process of waiting 24hrs until they update it on the app Dii Vdoma?"
"The State Tourism Development Agency states that foreigners entering Ukraine from the countries of the ‘red zone’ are allowed to not undergo self-isolation if they have a negative coronavirus test.The agency has said this in a statement with reference to the explanation of Health Minister Maksym Stepanov, Ukrainian News Agency reports.""Foreign citizens from the countries of the ‘red zone’ can enter Ukraine without self-isolation, but with a negative test for COVID-19,"" it was said.It is noted that a test for coronavirus by the polymerase chain reaction method with a negative result, made 48 hours before crossing the border of Ukraine, is a reason for foreigners from the ‘red zone’ to not undergo self-isolation."
Hey guys any update on what your experience was like at the airport ? James
"A comment on another thread has indicated that, in Odessa at least, someone showed up with a negative test result within the 48 hour window and it was NOT accepted. Since she showed it one day after the regulation went into effect and the ""word"" rarely makes it down the chain in a fast manner, this is no surprise. It might not be worth the hundreds of dollars to pre-test when you can do it for one-fourth the price there and not have to struggle to prove that what you have is valid."
"Hi - I'm in Krakow, Poland at the moment and I'm going to Kiev, Ukraine on Sunday. I have the medical insurance as required and I have downloaded the Dii Vdoma app as well. The problem is that I need a Ukrainian sim-card in order to register and I can't seem to get one here in Poland. Does anyone have any experiences with this issue? Any help would be appreciated :)"

"I just made entry last night August 6 at 2038 pm from Turkish airline. Washington Dulles airport - Istanbul - KBP. Since I’ve been reading everyone’s experience, I prepared travel insurance, the self quarantine apps, self quarantine address and SIM card( my girl had it waiting for me outside airport, no one allowed to be inside except passengers). I thought I could just gave the Ukraine SIM card number to broader guard so I can install it outside of airport like previous travelers experience BUT NO, now you can and HAVE TO buy the SIM card before passport control. Boarder guard still sent me to the counter to buy a new SIM card. He would not let me through even my girl had one ready for me. The SIM card counter is next to the only restroom in passport control lobby. Kiev star and Vodafone are the two only ones available. 10$ for one year use, 60 minutes international calling, 6gb data, unlimited calling texting locally. They will set it up in 5 minutes for you. You just pay 10$(they accept all kinds of currencies). Very easy process. The pain is you have to go back in line again waiting to see the boarder guard again. I talked to a young passenger who let me cut in front of him. I went to the same board guard who helped me set up the apps and I was let through without a problem. I met a traveler from US at SIM card counter, who didn’t prepare anything. He did not do the home work and had no idea about travel insurance, no quarantine apps and the worst was his iPhone was not UNLOCKED so the SIM card did not work in his phone. I dare to imagine how long it took for him to get his stuff together for the boarder guard lol So if you don’t have a Ukraine number and SIM card, I strongly suggest you go to SIM card counter to buy it first instead of standing in line wasting time. I also saw the update before I left DC that they take your PCR test 48 hours before your arrival. I took the test in Virginia August 1 so that policy was too late for me since I had 72 hours before my departure. In US some tests take 3-5 days even 7 days to get the result back so it might not work for you. I have kaiser and I get the result back in 24 hours! Next time if nothing changes, I’ll do the test first. Also border guard advised that they can’t just take any test result letter. It has to be certain format stating your full name, passport number, test location and time, what lab, the date of entry to Ukraine, test result and SPECIFICALLY stating it is a PCR test ONLY! They will not accept any other tests if you don’t have that PCR on your test result letter. You might have to TELL your doctor to type all necessary info because they will not. Anyway, I have dila home visit test at 0830 am on August 7 then I’ll drive to cherkasy for my self quarantine. Hopefully I’ll get the result back in 6-12 hours so the lab will notify whoever and the apps will set me free. But so far so good, dila already called my girl for confirmation and they can email me the result. Also boarder guard advised me to keep the negative test result email or letter when I leave Ukraine if I stay less than 14 days. They will have to see it. And of course they will fine you 600$ When you leave Ukraine if you skip the quarantine apps. Hope this helps to other travelers."
"Excellent post, Kai. Given what some people had said about test results not being accepted at the border post, I had a fantasy they were going to say, sorry, it needs to be officially translated by a Ukrainian consulate into Russian or Ukrainian and notarized by the UPA. And, of course, the sims at the airport are more expensive, but ... Instead of flying to Lwow via Istanbul, I should’ve chosen Kyiv,; maybe Turkish wouldn’t have cancelled my flights."
Kai thank you for your post. It was very helpful.
"I also arrived yesterday afternoon on a delayed flight from Frankfurt. My experience was very similar to Kai's except I already had a Vodafone sim card in my phone. I ordered it through ebay and it was already activated. I installed the app in Frankfurt, and it was no problem getting the app set up and worked through the prompts when I arrived."
"Hello, thank you very much for these informations. I would like to fly to Kiev. I'm French but I've been in Italy for one month (green zone) I will probably transit to France.

thanks for your answer !
"There is official testing information on KBP airport site, however the companies mentioned are different that were mentioned here before.https:/…"
"There is also a procedure how to enter Ukraine without ukrainian sim card. You only have to know the ukrainian # . So it seems like you can ask someone in Ukraine to buy a card for you and provide the phone # of the card. You can give the # to immigration officer, but they actually permit to install the physical card when you get to your address. Here is an official document about it (in ukrainian).https:/…instrukciya-diy-vdoma.pdf"
"Hello. My fiancee, a Russian citizen, will be driving to Kyiv from Belarus to catch an international flight the following morning after entering Ukraine. Length of stay in Ukraine, about 20 hours. Staying overnight at hotel near airport. Safe to assume she needs the PCR test result before she'll be allowed to enter or depart Kyiv airport ? Besides insurance and passport, (no visa required for Russian citizens, as we understand ) anything else needed at the land border checkpoint or airport ? Phone App required in this instance ? thank you"
"Jeff, it is a difficult question. My guess is if she shows the ticket going out of Ukraine within 24 hours, she should be fine without any test. It is my educated speculation though."
"I have written a few times before , but for people that do not like to scroll down , I will repeat again . You are given upto 24 hours to buy a simcard and upload. I did not hear of anyone that is turned away , because they did not have one. The only recent change is , now they installed kiosks selling them in airports. If they are open and operational you will be forced to buy one and give the number to border control over there. As this is a lot easier for them , also runs down the risk of someone avoiding or forgetting to start their Dii Vdoma App. The only downside in kiosks is that price is around about 10$ . Which is around double the price , you can get in the city center. But still very cheap compared to western standards and their phone plans."
"For people trying to pass over Ukraine only for 24-48 hours or less , this maybe not be enough time for a test and more importantly a result. You may want to make use of the recent development of a test result 48 hours before your arrival from the arriving country. This may not be a good option for the travellers from American continent. Because of the result , travelling/ transit time necessary. Travelling for a few days to ukraine( or to any country ) goes against every requirement and restriction, that countries want to impose . During the covid 19 precautions. It is understandable that those might be not allowed or penalized ."
P2GO TV. Do you know for a fact that in KBP airport such kiosks exist BEFORE immigration line? Thank you.
"These comments are very useful to me, as I'm going to be flying in on Wednesday. I do have some questions.Do you have to register in advance for the PCR test in Boryspil International Airport? If so, where?Is the kiosk that sells sim cards open all the time? That does seem better than having someone in Ukraine buy a sim card for me and giving over the #.Edited: 6:10 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"On the first question it is NO as in all announcements they say it is optional, in addition looks like several companies doing it, so who knows which company will be available when you arrive (registration is company specific). Just be ready to spend up to $80 on the spot for a test. The second question is the same as mine, and there is no clear answer. My parents in Kiev sent me a simm by mail, I still have 2 weeks before my trip, but there are stories on blogs that these days it takes months to receive a letter from Ukraine...Edited: 6:32 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Another thing was not mentioned here, you have to have an UNLOCKED phone, as most phones here in US are company specific (like ATT), such phones will not work with any ukrainian sim card.Edited: 6:51 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"A recap of current situation. If you are coming from a GREEN zone ( UK, Turkey, Netherlands etc...)country,all you will need is the compulsory Ukrainian based Covid19 Insurance. My company supplies quick, reliable and probably cheapest one at £9.00. Remember it is not your citizenship/ residency that counts , but the country you travelling from and where you spend the last 14 days. Apart from this , you will not need anything else and you can travel anywhere in Ukraine as little as possible , even less than a day."
"From the Ukraine Embassy today- Без обязательной обсервации и без предоставления согласия на самоизоляцию с использованием электронного сервиса «Действуй дома» Единого государственного веб-портала электронных услуг также могут въезжать в Украину лица, следующие через территорию Украины транзитом и имеющие документы, подтверждающие выезд за пределы Украины в течение двух суток."
"If you are coming from a RED zone country ( Usa, Germany, France , Spain, Poland , Russia , Belarus etc... )  First you will need the compulsory covid19 insurance just like everybody else, unless you are a citizen/ resident of Ukraine.  Second you will need an UNLOCKED phone that will accept an Ukranian simcard . Please use a secondary phone or a phone that accepts dual simcard . Also make sure it will function with a new SIM. Some phone contracts will not accept your phone's use with a different sim. The list of GREEN/RED zone countries updated in our website.  Also available through a Google search of relevant websites . You will need the Dii Vdoma app installed , preferably before you arrive , on that phone. If a kiosk is open and operational , the Border Control will make you buy a plan and simcard.More expensive than the ones you can buy in the city, but still a decent price for Western standards and  tariff plans. They will obtain the number for their records and to start the app. You can purchase it prior and have it send to your home country , but that's not necessary . Even if a kiosk is not open , you will be given upto 24 hours to buy a simcard and start the app. So please do not worry about that too much. I have heard of people being not allowed to board a plane, because they did not possess an Ukrainian based covid19 insurance. But, have not heard a single case where they are not allowed at the lack of an Ukranian simcard . If you are transferring to another city from KBP, many kiosks around Vokzalna sells it too."
"In order to get relieved from the Dii Vdoma app, thirdly you will need a PCR test. You can get this done at a few airports now. A few company / clinic operates. Not sure if they are operational 24/7 . Could also differ from airport to airport. For KBP I have been told price is around 1500-1800 uah ($55-75). Not the cheapest for Kiev,  but if it is convient for you, why not. Most results passed on to relevant authorities around 24- 48 hours. But you don't have to take the test in airport and can book a test for your arrival day or next day at the city. This can be done in a private or public clinic. The cheapest private clinic I found in Kiev after contacting at least 20, is around 900 uah ( $30). With similar 24-48 hours result time. Also found a public clinic for 500 uah ( $18) . But this one has not been tested and not sure about their result time. If you buy our assistance we help you with booking , result of the test . As well as translations if needed . Especially the result time will vary from city to city and the workload of that clinic from time to time. Also the price can dramatically change with each city and clinic . So far Kiev has been very reliable and most people got released from the app within 24 -48 hours. I met an Ukranian/ American guy yesterday, who has come to Kiev from Florida a few days ago. He said he was released from app in less than 2 days. Although he only used a private clinic in city. Then he made his way all the way down to Berdyansk to have a summer holiday . Although the process sounds complex , please do not let that put you off your trip to Ukraine. With the reduced price flight tickets, that should compensate a little for the clinic expenses."
"For UK visitors travelling from around London, the cheapest flights at the moment is through Wizzair from London LUTON airport, to Zulhany airport in Kiev. Which is in a central position compared to Borispol. You can take a taxi ride around £3.00 to most places in Kiev. As UK is in the GREEN zone,  you will not need anything but Insurance. For people arriving to Zulhany airport in Kiev from a RED zone country , I am afraid there is no airport PCR test at the moment. You have to book one in a private or public clinic in the city. You can send me a Personal Message for some free information. I do not have the latest nightlife information in Odessa and Lviv. But all other cities we cover ( Kiev, Kharkov, Dnipro, Zaphorizhia, Poltava,  Berdyansk) have fully functional nightlife and travel situation. Even when there was a 23.00 curfew for restaurants and bars a few weeks ago, I remember at least in Kiev and Berdyansk quiet a few establishments operated semi illegally. Check out my Berdyansk nightlife youtube video with Ukranian XFactor winner at https://youtu.be/DvB5wck2xZQAll places open in Berdyansk. I also heard that Saxon, Indigo, Heaven & Forsage was open this weekend in Kiev."

"I just had a following weird experience: I was traveling to Ukraine from Slovenia (Green Country), with a transit in Germany.I explained this to the green shirt agent (border guard?) that helps people with installing the apps, and she let me go to border control without installing the app. Then I went on to the border control agent, explained the situation again. He didn't require me to show him the app (which I never downloaded, but he did ask for my ukranian phone number (told him I don't have it) and address. He never told me anything about quarantine.So I am a bit confused now, what were the address and phone number needed for, if I am not in quarantine? I'm afraid that there might be a mixup and he mistakenly sent me to quarantine - and I would not like to pay a $1000 fine when leaving Ukraine.Any ideas what I should do in this situation?"
"On a side note. Does anyone know for sure if Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia ( border guards ) all share the same database which shows if a citizen of any of these countries have a current travel restriction ?"
"Roland, you arrived from a green country, so none of the discussion here applies to you. You are OK."
US State Dept. put Ukraine to level 3 (reconsider travel) up to level 2 few days ago. They actually put most of the world to level 3. So any tourism from US to Ukraine now is dead. I will still go in 2 weeks as I think the visit to see the parents is still legit...https:/…
"I know Snukr, you are determined to write a negative response to every post I write. But I have taken that trip from Zulhany airport to centre Kiev (eg Kreshatik) or Vokzalna at least 50 times. or opposite direction. Price is always around 100 uah ( around £ 3.00) . Obviously with a taxi app. Or you think Uber is the only safest way around to travel in Ukraine or Kiev. Uber has a good English interface, but more expensive to similar apps. I understand it could be preferable especially to first time visitors. Or even worse you take the first airport taxi that shouts out to you. In that case you will be lucky to pay less than the double price. You should not advice false info here as a veteran Kiev traveller like yourself. Most short to medium distance taxi trips , will cost around 100 uah ( £3) these days. Especially with a decent taxi app. I have never tried it, but BOLT is very suitably priced, I have been told. Also in English. I am using an Ukrainian one which I am happy to carry on because of loyalty discounts. On a different subject Netherlands is put back in the RED zone today. Hope that does not mean they put UK back in RED zone again soon. as UK after a long wait has just been put back in GREEN."

Appreciate any insight if your friends travelled.Thanks,Wahab"
"Hi _wahabim and welcome.Our friend did in fact travel from LHR to Odesa via Warsaw and there were no problems on arrival in Odesa.This was all on one ticket and luggage checked through to destination.The route that you are suggesting will not be a connected flight which means that you will have to collect luggage go through customs/immigration and re-check in.Don't know if that has any effect.Edited: 2:21 am, August 12, 2020 "

Ukraine seems opening up. Germany back in green zone. France for the first time and many more European countries added to GREEN zone countries list.
"Looks like the additional constraint on increase of cases over 2 weeks to be below 30% for ""green"" part of the list has been removed. Ukraine is ""open"" - just that visitors from ""red"" part of the list are subject to to arrive either with a recent negative SARS-Cov-2 test, or have to undergo an application controlled self-isolation that can be terminated with a negative test. Tests can be done at Lviv, Kyiv, Odesa airports, results available usually within less than 24h.

Make sure your test has your passport information and is in Ukrainian. Several people have informed me that some border guards are not accepting them otherwise.
"Hey all, Can UK citizens still enter Ukraine? I tried booked a ticket for 31st August but it says on ticket site ""Ukraine has restricted the entry of all foreign nationals except those with residence permits, and has suspended all flights except for repatriation flights.""I was there in July and everything was good then. Have things changed??"
"See discussion above. UK passport holder are allowed to enter Ukraine - and UK is still on the ""green"" part to the updated list, so travellers from the UK are allowed to enter without having to undergo quarantine. Visitors need to show proof of insurance covering Covid in Ukraine, get it before traveling, but can be bought at some of the airports at arrival (takes time).

"Hi you all, I have been reading this thread as well as what is written on https://visitukraine.today/As far as I understand me coming from Sweden (and Swedish passport) it would allow me to enter Ukraine and visit Kiev, I don't really need the app since ""green"" countries do not need to isolate. The only thing needed would be the insurance.Is this correct?Also is it worth visiting or are most of things closed? Thanks for the help!"
Ukraine closed its borders for foreigners starting this Sat.
"as someone above has posted. It is expected that Ukraine will today announce a closure of its borders to foreign visitors from 29th August until at least 28th September.https://hromadske.ua/posts/ukrayina-zakriye-…From midnight on August 29 to September 28 inclusive, foreign citizens and stateless persons are banned from entering Ukraine due to the coronavirus pandemic.This decision was made at a government meeting on August 26.According to Prime Minister Denis Shmygal, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should announce the decision of foreign partners and ""conduct all diplomatic work in this regard.""And who will be allowed to enter Ukraine?Exceptions are citizens who have residence permits in Ukraine, members of international and humanitarian missions or organizations. Or if they arrive at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine or are crew members.Citizens traveling to the territory of Ukraine in transit and having documents confirming their departure within 2 days, studying in Ukrainian educational institutions or serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine will also be allowed to pass. Refugees and those in need of additional protection will also be able to enter.In addition, the border is not closed to cultural figures who arrive at the invitation of cultural institutions together with an accompanying person. The same applies to participants in sports competitions held in Ukraine.And, finally, people who come for treatment in health care facilities or bring us homophoetic stem cells for transplants will be able to pass.Officials also clarified that border guards will be able to let Belarusian citizens through if they want to stay with us. President Volodymyr Zelenskyi asked for this.At the same time, the government has extended quarantine in UkraineThus, the Cabinet of Ministers extended the adaptive quarantine at least until October 31. Ukraine will continue to be divided into four zones according to the level of coronavirus spread.All due to the fact that 1500-2000 new patients with COVID-19 are registered in Ukraine every day. On August 21, coronavirus disease was detected in a record number of people - 2,328. Therefore, the epidemic is not over.In total, the virus was detected in 110,085 people in Ukraine. Of these, 2,354 patients died from complications and 53,454 recovered."
Yes we are banned. My girl just called me that Ukraine news just announced quarantine extension to November 1 along with ban for all foreigners entering Ukraine until November 1. Both effective today immediately. Those of you who already booked flights need to cancel or change it. https://youtu.be/Y44OyXt6evo
"I was due to fly on Saturday morning the 29th, do you think i can still enter or not???"
"Thank you for the information, that is pretty unfortunate for meCheers"
The ban on foreigners entering Ukraine is until 28th September not 1st November.
Hi SimonIn a word...no.I mean you can fly but you won't be allowed in.Jez
"official announcement... (which says from midnight tonight not the 29th, but i think that's a typo.https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/uryad-utochniv-k…"
"Ban to September, November it really doesn’t matter at this point. If the numbers don’t go down, government can always continue the ban till whenever. I truly hope the one month ban can make a difference. I had a plan to go back in October. Simon your best bet is to cancel the flight get your credit and book it immediately and go once they open again. Don’t wait too long in case they change again."
">official announcement... (which says from midnight tonight not the 29th, but i think that's a typoit's not a typo, unfortunately. Last moment government decided to put restrictions into action 1 day earlier than initially announced."
yeah...saw that. Glad I didn't change my flight to fly in today! looks like i'll book myself in to go on the 28th sept!
"Hi Simon,Have you decided to fly or cancelled your flight?"
"What about foreign nationals who are already in Ukraine? My wife, although ukrainian has a British passport and is coming back next month"
Glover123I am in exactly the same situation and as they are already there it shouldn't be a problem.Cannot imagine that anyone is going to round them up and deport themIt's only for entry.....at the moment
"Hello, does anyone know about feasible ways of getting an exception and be able to enter. I have seen that ""students"" and cultural workers would be allowed in. Any experiences trying?"
