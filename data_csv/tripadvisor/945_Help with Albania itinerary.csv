"Hi there, I am planning on going to North Macedonia and Albania and have some problems coming up with an itinerary for Albania. I would like to visit Tirana (with a day trip to Kruja), Vlore and Saranda (possibly some day trips from here as well). I have 8 or 9 days in the country, so my questions are:1. Is this all doable or should I stick to two instead of 3 cities? If 2, which ones? Tirana is a must. 2. My last stop in Macedonia is Ohrid, so where should I go from there first? Tirana or the coastline? 3. Please feel free to give me any other recommendations. I would also love to visit Korce and Berrat, but I just don't see how that would be possible on this trip. EDIT: I am going by car, so transport from one city to another is not a problem.Thanks!Edited: 5:20 am, June 25, 2020 "
When are you willing to travel? At the moment all Balkan countries have covid-19 spikes and borders are closed or mandatory 14 days of quarantine required.
"Hi, I contacted the Albanian embassy and they told me that borders are open for Serbian citizens. I am planning on going this summer if the situation permits. Would you recommend against going to Albania due to covid?"
"I recommend to go, if it is possible by law. Viruses similar to current one are always with us, simple distancing from crowds and washing of hands help against them.Edited: 2:14 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"floriani 22, whyare you not telling truth?There are Balkan countries without quarantine for tourists."
I don't talk to who denies the reality
"Katarina, it is not the citizenship, but where you come from. Monitor the situation, once you are in a covid-19 neglecting country it is extremely difficult to keep social distance. The others will be attached to youEdited: 2:55 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"This florian guy or whatever is his name is fear mongering. Covid is just a normal virus over reacted by the media for specific purposes.Nevertheless,.people in Albania are not neglecting. Distance in restaurants is respected, in busses you enter with Mask, and hostels have strict rules that if are not respected are fined with 5,000 euros.People can easily do vacations."
"Yes just normal virus, with the borders closed by the neighbors. Keep saying that to you that is nothing. Social distancing in Albania? Hahahaha that's a joke. The fines? All on paper as the 120% target on the plan.All the spikes after the lock down are due to neglecting safety measures in all countries.Edited: 9:08 am, June 26, 2020 "
"My friend cought this normal virus. She went for 2 weeks in hospital, no ICU, but oxygen yes. After leaving the hospital she was really weak for other 2 weeks. She is 38 and she fully recovered in 1 month. Without hospital she could be somewhere else."
"What issues does your friend have?Does she suffer from other illnesses?Is she obese?Does she suffer from diabetes, weak heart etc?I know people that had flue and had to be in hospital for 5 days for example."
"Unfortunately she has been fine and a little too active for me. She goes everywhere, she never stops...a hurricane"
"I have two or three (I don't count them) serious pneumonias in my life. With hight temperatures etc.What for that? C'est la vie!Edited: 5:00 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Ohrid to Tirana is the best route. I'm not sure what you are going to Sarande for. If it's for the beach then there will surely be somewhere closer to Tirana with nicer beaches. Sarande beach is just gravel and rubble. Albania is a very small country. 1-2 nights is fine in most places.If you stuck to the north of the country you could also add Berat.Edited: 10:09 pm, June 27, 2020 "
