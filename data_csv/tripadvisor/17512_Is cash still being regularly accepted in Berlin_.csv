"Hi all,I am travelling to Berlin in 2 days' time. I would rather not use my debit card because of the non-sterling fees the bank takes when you use your card abroad. So am wondering whether cash is commonly accepted in Berlin right now (due to COVID)?"
"Yes, Germans are obsessed with cash, a little pandemic is not gonna change that. ;)No, honestly, a lot of stores put up signs asking customers to use a contactless card if available and overall the percentage of card payments increased due to covid but you will always be able to use cash pretty much everywhere. Germany is much more cash-based than most of Europe."
thanks so much!
"You will need a combination of cash and card. Lots of small shops take cash only and one coffee shop I went to only took card payments for over €10.My bank charge 3% for cash withdrawal and the same for card payments, so it made no difference cost wise."
"The basic rule is that you use a debit card to get cash from an ATM (depending on your bank you may get a small fee for each withdrawal) and you use a credit card for purchases, museums, restaurants, bars etc. My credit card (a Halifax Clarity) does not charge any fees for purchases abroad, but if you use a credit card to get cash, you will be charged interest from day one , because this is considered to be a loan.Every time I visit Berlin, there are more and more places which take cards (sign of the times), but I always have some cash, just in case. Most restaurants and shops will have stickers showing which cards are accepted."
"As others have said, cash is accepted everywhere, 100%. But card reluctance is now drastically reduced. Perhaps it’s a side effect of the pandemic, but I also think it has to do with the ease of use of the new mobile point-of-sale gizmos. In any case in Berlin, I now pay for almost everything with my Mastercard credit card via Apple Pay on my iPhone, even very small purchases under €10. Merchants almost never decline. I only rarely visit an ATM nowadays, since I rarely need any cash."
Maybe it varies with the area but many bars and restaurants that I go to are cash only and I have not seen any changes on my last visit a few weeks ago. Down here I rarely use cash !
"It seems now some places only accept cash and some only take credit card even here in the U.S. With that in mind, I would make sure you have a combination of both to be perfectly honest. There really is no telling if every place will take cash nor if every place would take credit card."
"Really, Jordans? So how many places that don‘t take cash have you seen in Germany?"
and yet another completely irrelevant post by jb.
"""So how many places that don‘t take cash have you seen in Germany?""Not many but there are some.https:/…a-53349878"
"I have yet to see somewhere that will not accept cash ! Whereas many smaller restaurants and bars will not accept cards, even German bank cards"
"I get the feeling that that claim is based on a photo of an unidentified café in Berlin, and so I'm going to say it's bollocks."
Yes!Please carry cash. Notes and cents both are very imp there. You won't be able to buy basic stuff with a 100Euro note!And not everywhere cards are accepted which can put you in a stressful situation
"DW is a mainstream German media outlet, I can't imagine one thinks they are just fabricating photos. Carrying both is just commonsense advice when traveling, anyway. The original question is sort of pointless, though, you'd take cash and see if they took it, and if they didn't, you'd have to use your debit card even if you'd rather not. I guess she just didn't want to be surprised, but if they didn't accept cash, you'd have to choice anyway, really."
"This is a typical case of being ""Lost in translation"". The German text on the signs in the shops does not say, ""no cash"". It says that cards and contactless payment are preferred, and people are asked to use those. This does not mean, though, that they won't take cash if the customer has no (contactless) card. They will."
"Unfortunately many businesses (as well as taxis) are still cash only in Germany. I travel all over Europe on a regular basis (well, a little less regularly right now), and Germany is the only country I still need to get cash. It is a hassle in my opinion, and I wish the Germans would do something about it."
"OP: Did you travel and if so, how are things and did you manage with cash OK?"
Cash is accepted everywhere as you can read in all of the previous posts....
"It will be a cold day in hell when the cash crazed Germans ban cash :)You will have MUCH bigger problems if you do NOT carry cash with you at all times.Edited: 5:07 am, August 21, 2020 "
"Day 3 of my trip to Berlin and so far, I have paid for everything in cash. I have not seen anywhere asking for card payments only, unlike in the UK !"
