"Don't use your credit card, or better yet, don't patronize these a##holes who ripped us off for $ 2000K on Nov. 25, 2004. You've been warned!"
Which places on the island or was it just Senor Frogs? What happened?
"so sorry, what happened?"
"wife and i are going to cozumel ( january 28th thru february 4th ) and need more info concerning using cash or taking a charge card . fluid either way , however which is safer ?"
"That's just awful, carpenterma! Seems like this is an all around epidemic: My relative got ripped off for approx. the same amount as you right here in Ontario just 1 week ago! Pretty scary."
"That's horrible! We had a scar like that last time we went to Coz, but when we called Visa, they cleared it up. What we thought was 1500 dollars was acutally only 1500 pesos. Check with your creditcard company...maybe that is what happened. "
I thought that only happened to us. We used our credit card in Cancun in a reputable upscale restaurant. Got home and found out our card had been cancelled by our credit card company. There was an employee stealing the card numbersand luckily ours was not misused. THat was they last time we ever used a card in Mx. Cash only.
"Just make sure that they do not any more zero's to your bill. Right now its 11 to 1..2000k would have been 22,000 pesos...Ive heard of them doing that to tourists. Its just not right...I would not leave an open CC with them. I would pay as the drinks arrive and leave tip at the end...."
"I use three forms of payment, credit cards, dollars and peso. Now most places are running 11pesos to a dollars, but when it was 10.5 some did 11 some did 10 to a dollar. I have never had any issues with credit cards. plus you get the best rates. You can always use ATM machines some places give in pesos and some in dollars you just have to see what they are. "
"I just got back from Mexico. This was an area of great concern to me. One solution is a travel funds card from American Express. You can purchase the card with your Green/Gold/Blue card with say a balance of $300. You can always add more to the card over the internet or by phone. They will also replace it like travelers checks if it is lost or stolen. No, I don't work for American Express, it's just a very good idea."
