"We are driving down to Corolla on July 4th. Looking for suggestions on which route we should take and any tips for this trip. Google has us driving through Delaware (rt. 13). Is this the best choice. This is our first time visiting the area and we are very excited! Do we need to cross the bridge by a certain time, or any other helpful advise is appreciated. Thank you!"

Keep up with Covid19 restrictions at https://www.nc.gov/covid19Right now we are under Phase 1 restrictions. Who knows what it will be then.
Thank you both! I've made of your recommendations. Be well.
