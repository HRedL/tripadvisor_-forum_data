I need to refund my booking because the flight has cancelled and the country doesn’t allow outsiders due to the corona virus and I have called Travelgenio many times but there’s no answer from the call. The line got hang up after 1 min. @TravelgenioHas anyone have the same issue? That let me feel Travelgenio doesn’t want to refund or deal with any cases as of corona virus impact so they don’t answer any calls.
"When did this start - you jay be rushing? Travelgenio will need to get a refund from the airline (just one of the issues by booking through a third party) before refunding you. I have a cancellation outstanding - not through Travrlgenio (and not virus related) and was told it could take up to 6 weeks for the airline to refund. I suspect people are quite busy right now.....,Edited: 8:22 am, February 08, 2020 "
"Refunds for cancelled flights via 3rd parties is a 6-12 week process. The 3rd party doesn't refund the passenger until the airline refunds the 3rd party. The process is time consuming. If you are waiting on the refund to purchase a ticket home the wait in in vain. Purchase another ticket immediately and go home. The refund will follow, eventually. Calling and harassing the 3rd party isn't going to help."
"Keep in mind that if you had just purchased directly from the airline, you probably could have pulled up your reservation on the airline's webpage and requested a refund directly from them. Now, as stated, you must wait for Travelgenio to request a refund from the airline, receive the refund, deduct their fees, and then pass your money back to you. The airlines and third parties are swamped with all the cancellations. It may take some time to get your money back."
"Hello Shaniece, thank you for contacting us. Of course we can help you with your refund. Bear in mind that the refund times depend on the airlines. As soon as the airline processes it, you will receive your refund via the form of payment you used to make your booking. Anyway, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and we will check the status of your refund and will give you an approximate time for its processing. Regards."
"""...That let me feel Travelgenio doesn’t want to refund or deal with any cases as of corona virus impact so they don’t answer any calls..."" Really !!!! Are you being serious? This is a worldwide issue. Given the number of flights disrupted by issues connected with the precautions being made to limit the spread of the virus it is no wonder that help and customer service lines lines are overloaded Shaniece - it is simply not realistic to expect to receive any refund you may be due immediately. For a start you will only get any refund due once the airline has sent the funds to Travelgenio and as they must be cancelling many many flights nothing is going to happen at their end quickly. Add to that the fact that by booking via an online TA and thus inserting a third party into your booking you have to allow for knock on delays as the OTA itself processes the refund and you should not expect to see any money back any time soon .Edited: 3:24 pm, February 08, 2020 "
Hello. I need help from your customer service because of a changing flight.I called too many times but wasn't possible. Giada.depra@gmail.com Please contact me soon.
Giada - not a good idea to have your email address on a public forum (leaving yourself open to much spam)I suggest you remove your post and contact Travelgenio via the email address in post 4
Do customer service and Travelgenio belong together?
"Hi Giada, you will receive a reply by mail during next 48 hours. Regards"
I sent 2 emails to Travelgenio already regarding refund for a flight to Beijing due to Coronavirus- no response and I tried phoning the company and the number seems to not work. Please advise how to get this sorted?
Hello Karina. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next 48/72 hours. Thank you for your cooperation.

"#15 - refunds will take weeks- there are thousands, possibly even millions of people affected by cancellations right now. I made a non-virus related cancellation in December. It took 8 weeks for the refund to come through.You will simply have to wait."

"HelloI have flight on saturday to Sri Lanka from Doha. And i also couldnt reach @travelgenio customer service even they say during the call that if you have any question about corona virus, it will take much time to talk with customer service due to calls. But they never answer.We had to cancel our Sri Lanka flights from Doha because our company which i worked for is not allowed us to travel internationally and domestically. I bought my ticket from @travelgenio and my friend bought the same ticket from Sri Lankan Airlines website. He easily contacted with Srilankan airlines customer service and refunded fully. I have not even reached @travelgenio customer service. I sent mail about refund of my ticket but i am still waiting reply. I hope everyone is so sensitive about this global issue and not to put us in difficult situation and reply asap.Fingers crossedThanks,"
"imge t - welcome, Sadly you are learning the difference between booking with an airline and booking with a third party."
imge t please refer to our call center numbers. Mails in customer.service@travelgenio.com have a few days reply delay because of the many requests we are receiving. You will find them in the General Conditions section. Regards

I ask for a quick reply.Reservation number: RD4PR4 or 17260922Reservation number: SC36M2"
"Same goes here. I tried to call travelgenio many times, but no answer. My flight will be on 21 April 2020,but my family unable to travel due to coronavirus. I need to cancel the flight ticket and ask for the refund. What I suppose to do now?I sent the email. To travelgenio but no feedback."

Travel genio ref CCJJDV. I have raised a cancellation request, ticket No 3344104 but not had any confirmation that you are looking at my request to cancel. I fully appreciate that we are in difficult times, but it would be courteous to know that you have at least received the email and that my request to cancel all 3 tickets on all legs of the journey is being dealt with.ThanksEdited: 4:41 am, March 12, 2020 "
"I have called @travelgenio so many times but on hold for ages, got through twice but they cut me off within a minute or two so still unable to sort out getting my refund.

I bought the cancellation protection cover too and am due to fly to Qatar this monday, lesson learnt to buy direct from the airline."

Dear TravelgenioThis is customer service number for international calls that i found on your blog 0034 91 116 0765 (international calls).I understand that customer service is so busy. But in my situation it should has priority so it shouldnt be delay because the flight is in 2 days on Saturday. Thanks for your guide to check General Conditions. But it is not acceptable that you consider corona virus issue in general condition. It is really global crisis and should be consider in special conditions. Each airlines has refund or open tickets without any cancellation fee because of corona virus cancellation requests. My friend's cancellation and full refund request accepted by Sri Lankan airlines for the same flight. So my expectation from travelgenio is the same. Because we are your customer and we use travelgenio to trust your brand and customer oriented approach. So this is really epic and sad global case. I believe you will show the same sensivity as everyoneLooking forward your replyThanks
You never answer !!!!
"I have the same problem, it is impossible to contact Travelgenio!!!!"
"Thanks for the reply, i already have but no reply, i spoke to an advisor just who said they would resend my confirmation email with my code and once i have that to call back (nightmare) to cancel the flights but they cut the call off AGAIN, third time this has happened with me calling over 40 times in the last few days Trying to get through. But not sure how long i will have to wait for that. When i sent the emails the other day i attached a screen shot which was from yourselves confirming my booking and it also stated i had the cancellation protection cover Too. I have been told to self isolate due to working in a hospital and exposure to possible coronavirus cases so i just want this sorted asap. I have also direct messaged yourselves on trip advisor and appreciate you Be really busy but getting cut off by your advisors on calls is frustrating."
"Dear Travelgenio, I do understand that you are overloaded, cannot answer the call etc... but not giving any piece of information about Coronavirus on your website? It looks like you don't exist.Kasia"
You now that none of you are writing directly to Travelgenio? This is not the travelgenio webpage.
Same with me. I have been trying to cancel my tickets to Italy from 1st March. They have not responded till now.
I called them on 17th feb and was told my flights were cancelled. I then received an email saying I would get refunded in the next few days but this still hasn’t been done - nearly a month later!
"Shamster - why do you persist in posting on here as if you are speaking to travelgenio about stuff you have had from TA ( for example ""i attached a screen shot which was from yourselves confirming my booking.."" ) ? when in fact the messages you are talking about were clearly from Travelgenio. You need to deal with them direct not share your correspondence with a load of perfect strangers in the TA community who cannot help you We have explained several times to all the new posters like yourself that this is a public travel forum - a chat room for the Trip Advisor community which has NOTHING to do with TG. and is not a messaging service to Travelgenio.. If the Travelgenio bot from Madrid pops up asking you to contact them in response to posts you have made on here (they seem to be trying to field situations potentially resulting in bad press and sometimes follow the discussions on this forum) you still need to contact THE COMPANY on the email address they mention not write more messages to them on this thread will get you nowhere very fastEdited: 8:39 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Thanks for the message, why do you feel the need for such a lo post though? Fyi the reason i Am persistent in posting (the second message, wow thats persistent) here is as its been the only time they have actually replied to me. But thanks for wasting everyone time with your message, bye now."

"Travelgenio gives very poor service in normal times. At the moment, its call centre will be totally overwhelmed by the number of calls. You will be very lucky if you are able to get any response, but you are the one who chose to put a dodgy online agent between you and the airline."
"Everyone is going to have to be extra patient - they are not known to be the fastest responders at the best of times but these are exceptional times and call centres will be swamped with the volume of calls coming through - all of which are probably from people who consider THEIR problem to be a priority/more important than the next person'sEdited: 5:24 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Exactly MenorcaRegular.It wasn’t that long ago the bot was saying there would be a response within 48 hours, thenit changed to 72 hours, then a few days. Now it’s using the vague “following days” whatever that means.Expect long delays or no response at all. Anything else is a bonus. Even great agencies are struggling to cope as are the airlines at the moment. Folk who decided cheap was the only search criteria when buying tickets are now repenting not using service and reliability to determine who to appoint to purchase their tickets or to book direct."

"I am due to fly to Canada and would like to cancel my flight. The airline is West Jet - on their website it says that they are offering a $0 cancellation fee for any trips booked before March..which mine was. Does this mean I will get a full refund if I cancel? They also have advised travelers to deal directly with the 3rd party they have booked with, but I have been unable to communicate with Travelgenio. No replies to emails or no connections on the phone. Can anyone advise?"
"Hi Zowena, due to the amount of questions received during these days our mails are delaying the reply a few days in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Also you can reach our call center if your flight is in next 72 hours in order not to collapse the hotlines. You will find them in the General Conditions section. regards"
"Zowena,Travelgenio never answer emails in under 72 hours at the best of times, so don't expect them to answer them quickly at the moment!!! Goodness knows what ""Also you can reach our call centre if your flight is in next 72 hours in order not to collapse the hotlines"" means? It is total gibberish!"
"Hi, I booked a flight through travelgenio from London Gatwick to Banjul, Gambia by connecting in Barcelona. But due to Coronavirus I tried to call Travelgenio without no response and then called Iberia and was told that my flight was still active but I was told that Barcelona El Prat Airport is locked down so there is no way for me to reach Banjul, Gambia. My flight is on the 27th of March 2020. Can I have an update about my flight, please. Thank you."
"Hi. Yeah, I have the same problem. Travelgenio simply doesn't answer the phone. I have called more than 20 times over the past 5 days - I wait on the line the time they state is the waiting time, and then instead of getting an answer I'm disconnected. They don't reply to the e-mail requests either. I have requests waiting for a week or so, while my flight is in two days. If you find a mean of communication they respect or find that they are officially stopped giving customer support - please update. I will get my money through the court then. Thanks."

"Hello,I can’t get through to Travelgenio either.  I want to be postpone my flights in April to Istanbul. Turkish airlines, whom I am flying with, are allowing this free of charge, but it must be done by today or I will miss out!! . But I have to contact Travelgenio to change my booking. They will not answer their phones. I have tried several times have been cut off after a short while. Are they ignoring the coronavirus crisis? This is a disgusting way to treat customers during a crisis.If so I would strongly advise anyone against using them. It is much better to book directly with the airlines. I’m going to make my views known to sky scanner about this. It is a disgrace to let customers down at a time and we should all be putting to get it to help one another."
"Hello Carolineann. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking and your doubts so we can review your case and give you an answer? Thank you, regards."
"Skyscanner will not be interested Carolineann - you will be wasting your time ""making your views known to Skyscanner"" Skyscanner is simply a portal through which people can check what prices are on offer - the online agents etc pay to advertise on the Skyscanner platform and once a customer selects one flight option and proceeds via the link to the online ticket flogger's website that is the end of it from Skyscanner's perspective - they are not responsible for the site you actually book through - you CHOOSE your supplier and by proceeding to book through them you agree to their T&CsAs you are discovering, ""It is much better to book directly with the airlines"" - as you have now realised because you didn't and inserted an intermediary between you and the airline (Travegenio are its customer on your booking not you) you cannot deal directly with Turkish Airlines and cannot do anything to ensure that your wishes are carried through quickly enoughEdited: 4:07 pm, March 16, 2020 "
@travelgenio i still dont have any response about my cancellation from yourside. I also talked to Sri lankan airlines and they answered in the same day. I will sue if you dont answer my mails. Sri lankan airlines confirmed that they refund my tickets. And they asked me to tell you that they will refund. So refund and answer asap. It is so shame
"For heaven's sake. Travelgenio has very poor service when things are normal. Right now, its call centre will be in meltdown and it will take some time for your problem to be addressed.Threatening a law suit will not have any effect."
"It is not threatining. It is asserting by law. If you try each way and get no solution or answer, you protect your rights by law. So this is not a kind of anger claim. This is global issue and so sad for everyone. Each airlines is so busy due to the number of questions but they aswer very well in customer oriented or human oriented manner. It is not personal case so @travelgenio shall do the same."
Thank you for contacting us imge t. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days. Best regards
">>Each airlines is so busy due to the number of questions but they aswer very well in customer oriented or human oriented manner.<<No, they are not answering well. Every airline and travel-related call centre is in meltdown, and there are long delays in obtaining a response."

TRAVELGENIO I emailed you yesterday and still no reply to my email.  I am very worried now. I urgently need to reschedule my flights.Can you let me know at least when you will return my email??
Travelgenio I send you any email yesterday. As you advised.Still no reply!!I urgently need to reschedule my flights.I also contacted your company through the form on your website as you recommended. Still no reply!!Can you give me a timeline as to when my email will be answered??
"@MenorcaRegular The last thing I need is a lecture from somebody like you at this time. People should pull together and be kind to each other at this time. Your comments are so unhelpful and hurtful. Yes I should’ve probably booked directly to the airline, but it’s a bit late now for that and I’m trying to resolve the situation. I suppose that you have never made any mistakes in your life? If you don’t have anything constructive to say then I suggest keeping your condescending remarks to yourself."

"Denisa, the airline doesn't control these third party booking sites.

As you chose to use this abysmal company, that's not the case. Your contract is with Travelgenio."
"Hi Denisa, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Please contact us via customer.service@travelgenio.com if you have not done so, write your booking code and flight date in the subject line, and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
"Denisa.You have a ""reply"" from the Travelgenio Bot. It is their new stock reply to the virus situation. No human reads or replies to posts on this forum."
"""..I need a answer as soon as possible..."" - if you are expecting a full refund any time soon forget it - you will be part of a very long line of other travellers also waiting for refunds to be processed and nothing you can do or say will speed things up BTW have you checked the T&Cs that you signed up to when booking your holiday? Even if the airline refunds the flight cost in full TravelGenio are entitled to deduct their own administration charges from it in accordance with their T&Cs."
"Hi Travelgenio,This is regarding booking reference 17746019. Because there is travel ban imposed for the traveler and flight has been cancelled by Etihad, please cancel the ticket and initiate the refund.Booking code Travelgenio:17746019Booking code Amadeus: VRA7DSPlease contact on the number and email contacts given for these tickets."
"This is a social media platform, not Travelgenio. Your message is simply clutter here. You have to contact them not post in a discussion group."
I have emailed you 3 or 4 times over last week and no reply. I tried ringing and no answer. My flight is Monday to canada and won’t be going due to coronavirus.
"Sorry Colin M. This is not Travelgenio. Instead it is a Trip Advisor discussion forum. As Travelgenio work on a shoestring at the best of times, expecting a speedy response at a time of international crisis is unrealistic, I'm afraid.Did you book through them because they appeared to be cheaper? Now you know why. Minimal customer service staff, not that most of the other online ticket floggers are any better. If you're expecting a refund, Travelgenio are likely to take a cut, so you won;t get back as much as you paid.If the flight itself is still being operated by the airline, but you are unable to travel on it, don't expect a refund at all."
HiI am facing the same issue .We trying to contact Travel Travelgenio.com and raised service requests for 3 times but there is no reply from travelgenio.com.Eitihad cancelled the flight due to Covid-19 but to get the refund travelgenio is not replying .fraud website .want to take legal action
"The situation you describe is not a ""fraud"" - you are just not getting the refund you hoped for as quickly as you want which is completely different. A fraud is a deliberate attempt to permanently deprive you of funds that are rightfully yours and there is no evidence that is the case with regard to your situation . Are you even sure that the airline had sent the refund to Travelgenio yet? Until that havens TG will not be able to do anything and once it does TG will have to process it (deducting any fees you agreed to pay when booking) and they are not known for speedy actions at the best of times so will be overwhelmed at the moment You are going to have to be patient.Edited: 5:18 am, March 21, 2020 "
Hello Neha. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days. Thank you for your cooperation.
I got my flight on the 27th and have also no reply. i just wrote the 3rd message. Oman Air moved the flight from the 26th to the 27th which would shorten the vacay a few days before vacaition. Furtheron there´s a travelban. My bookingcode: 16806927

"@TRAVELGENIO the country doesn’t allow outsiders due to the corona virus and I have called Travelgenio many times but there’s no answer from the call.How it's going to be for the refund ??? I have raised tickets twice , here are the numbers : 3445887 & 3483932.and even sent you email. Please respond asap.ThanksMithun"
Mithun - whether you can receive any refund will depend on whether the actual flights have been cancelled by the airline or whether they are still operating but you are unable to travelStart by looking at the airline website at what they are offering - may be date change or voucherIf the flight is cancelled and the airline are issuing refunds then you need to persevere with Travelgenio (maybe try the email address the bot provides) and request that they process with the airline
Thank Carol for your reply. Yeah I checked @ airline website and they are offering full refund on cancellation or free reschedule.I reached out to airline also but they suggested me to reach out travel agent for refund. But Travelgenio not responding.Thanks for sparing some time and responding really appreciate that.

"ShauLita,For your urgent travel need, you may want to consider arranging your own travel via an airline directly -- as in booking new tickets. If you read back through this thread (and other postings about Travelgenio) you'll see that they aren't usually very prompt in responding/taking action, even before the current COVID19 crisis. If you're lucky you may be able to get refunded from Travelgenio later.I would also check what the current entry rules are for where ever you're trying to travel to/from. Due to current travel bans, quarantines, etc, you may want to contact the government to see if you can get an extension due to the COVID19 circumstances.Edited: 12:30 pm, March 30, 2020 "

Hello @travelgenio - I have a return flight booked next Fri 10 April. I've sent multiple emails for the past two weeks and used your website's contact form to submit a cancellation request but haven't received anything back yet. I also can't get through on the phone as it just hangs up. I understand that of course you are extremely busy processing cancellations but I just want to ensure that my request has been received and will be processed as well. Obviously I can't fly next week due to domestic travel bans in Australia. Could someone please get back to me?
"Hello Travelgenio,Still waiting for your reply. Please just confirm my cancellation , it's ok if refund takes time. Please already there so many uncertainties we are dealing with.Thanks,Mithun"
"Hello, I have a same issue. My flight has canceled because of virus. I can not reach anyone. I called them and wait long but they did not answer me. Really weird situation. What I am suppose to do?"
"TravelGenio are based in Spain. Spain is one of the countries worst hit by Covid-19 and the entire country is under lockdown. If there are any staff at all in TravelGenio's offices, they are probably totally unable to deal with the volume of calls and emails. Lets face it, they weren't much good at customer service before the outbreak. I suspect that what response they are able to make is by individual staff members working from home at the moment."
"Hello Travelgenio,I have contacted you two times already but I am still waiting for your reply. And my reservation is for tomorrow (of course flight is cancelled). I understand that the whole procedure with refund will take time, but I am expecting that you will answer.

INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"Hi Travelgenio. This is not helping me. I've already seen this. and wow, I'm so surprised you replied! :D with no explain but one link! I thought you've never learned!I'm going to explain my situation properly.My flight and my sister's are canceled by Emirates airline at 28th March, and NO ONE informed us about the cancellation. We just found out in the Heathrow airport, this was awful experience I've had ever.Long story short, I and my sister want to get a full refund of our flights.this is not our fault, we didn't cancel anything, even my flight, was canceled twice. (I changed the first one and I paid 53euro for the change fee, but it turns out nothing. cause the second one was also canceled. I paid for nothing.)The whole experiences that customers are going through are terrible, you cannot just give me the link without any explanation."
Travelgenio use a bot to post replies on here.Sorry but no human from the company will actually read your post.
"Oh really? thank you.but I thought that's not a bot, seems like a human being wow... thank you!"
Wow you actually went to the airport without checking on the status of your flight before you left home? Why?
"I booked two flights from London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon from Emirates airline. But the airline canceled my flights, I want to get the full refund of my flights.I tried to contact to Travelgenio/tobe so hard with facebook, calls, website and emails. but there is no answer.Did anyone already have the refund? and the process is done already?thank you."
"I got an email couple of days ago: ""We are contacting you to inform you that due to the global crisis resulted from the expansion of Coronavirus, your flight has been cancelled.We are currently managing the requests for refunds of all affected tickets, so that as soon as the airline approves such refunds, the amount will be refunded to the form of payment provided when making the booking. We will continue to keep you informed of the progress of the refund process.We are sorry for the inconvenience this situation beyond our control may cause you.""I cancelled all my bookings, trips and everything because of that e-mail but when if I check the airline or even travelgenio it doesn't look like the flight has been canceled. What should I do? Tickets are actually for August 2020. Best regardsEdited: 9:26 am, April 04, 2020 "
No me and my sister didn't get any information of cancellation until we reach the airport. That's why we were more angry at that time
"And also we checked the status before we leave the house ofc, but the flight was ready to departure on time when I search on google"
"Sorry I forgot to mention I got this e-mail from Travelgenio. Like I said the weird thing is, i think the flight isn't actually cancelled. But all my plans, honeymoon, beatutiful resort. I canceled everything because of that e-mail. Current price for everything is like 2x higher. I'm so pissed. Well if I get my money for the tickets back i guess I can change plans for ""after corona""."
"Hi Yhyeon, thank you for contacting us. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days. Best regards."
"If you have both the email showing incorrect information about the flights having been cancelled when they had not AND have taken screenshots of the airline's website showing that the flights are NOT currently cancelled at all which you can then use as evidence of the info on their email being incorrect (if you haven't taken screenshots do it quickly) ,I would suggest that you consider finding out whether you could sue them for consequential losses such as any non refundable deposit on the honeymoon arrangements etc that you have suffered as a result of cancelling unnecessarily because of their mix up.Edited: 10:27 am, April 04, 2020 "
"I am desperately trying to Contact Travelgenio by phone without success.My sister purchased a return ticket from Travelgenio to India. Her return flight on 30th March was cancelled due to Covid-19. There is no news on how she will get back to UK. The airline has asked her to contact Travelgenio to make her return ticket ""open"" so that she can choose when to return. Is there an online form to be completed on Travelgenio web site, if so where do i find this? Can you please email me on cchitroda@hotmail.co.uk. thank youRegards, Chan"

Hi. The airline has approved the refund on the 25th of March and they have said the action to be taken is your responsibility now to process the refund.I will call the airline again this week while we we eagerly await your processing of our refund.Thanks
Hello Ellie. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response about your refund to your mailbox in the next few days. Thank you for your cooperation.

Hi Angiejaz;INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…Best regards
"Hi @travelgenio, the link you supplied doesn't have an online form as you say. I've already emailed customer service multiple times and I have submitted a Cancellation Request form already. I received a generic email from TravelGenio on Sunday evening saying that if flights are cancelled you will organise refunds, but haven't received a tailored respond to my request and have not been assigned a case number. My first flight was scheduled for this Friday 10 April, so that's 48 hours away and I haven't heard back. I understand why there are delays with communication and I appreciate that it takes a while to organise refunds, however I would like this request at least responded to given we are 48 hours out from the flight. The flight was meant to be with Qantas and according to their website it has been cancelled, as Western Australia has shut its borders so it's not possible for us to travel there anyway.Please, can someone email me back directly to acknowledge this cancellation and subsequent refund is being processed (even if that processing takes some time)? Thank you."
"Isabella, the responses from Travelgenio are those of a bot - no human from the company are reading anything on this forum.If QF have cancelled the flight - not rescheduled it but cancelled in that it won't operate, period - then depending on QF's terms you may/should be eligible for a refund, but again that depends on the ticket that Travelgenio purchased on your behalf.If there is a booking at the QF website and it shows that the flight has been cancelled then make note of the details and those of when you asked Travelgenio to make the booking.Travelgenio are a useless company at best, and right now they're worse than that. Rather than try to contact them, speak to your credit card issuer and ask if they'll deal with Travelgenio to process the refund offered by QF.Travelgenio may take a month or two to ask QF for a refund, and they will charge a fee for processing that refund. If you had other flights booked with other carriers the same process will have to take place, and they'll charge fees for each refund.I wouldn't spend two minutes trying to contact Travelgenio, but that's up to you to decide."
"Thanks for this! Much more helpful than anything I've gotten out of Travelgenio... I figured as much and have had someone else suggest going through my credit card issuer instead too, so I think time to take that route after many failed attempts with Travelgenio. Thanks again and all the best!"
"Hi Isabella, it is shown in the contact section. Could you tell us your booking code?"

I have a feeling you'll only be contacted if you are due to travel in the next 3 days.
"Omer: Don't put your email address on a public forum unless you want LOTS of SPAM.As Roj says, you will hear from TG around the date of your flight. They have hundreds of thousands of customers to deal with"
"Hey,Thanks for the feedback. I just want to know if i can get a refund for a regular flight ticket due to the current situation."
"Hola, Gracias por la respuesta, pero mi vuelo es para el sábado y hasta el momento no he recibido nada. Realmente os pasáis un poco. Indíqueme cuando me va a reembolsar ? Hay serio puede responder a mi solicitud?Gracias!"
"Hi, I've been waiting for 5weeks now and may I know the update of our flight's details, I would like to refund our ticket. Our Booking reference number: PF5ICT and Booking code Travelgenio:17698105. Still, on your website, our ticket was ""Open"", however, indirect airlines websites, it has been canceled. I think this matter deserves your urgent attention to settle this problem and you are not coordinating properly. I've received an email once only from your helpdesk but until now no response."
"EVA Air is an excellent airline. I have flown them almost exclusively. Great service, food is decent, and they are highly recommended. However, in this era of Covid, they appear to be using the virus as an excuse for some sort of bridge loan, from their customers. I had to cancel a recent flight to the US, and they tell me it will be fully refunded. Within 90 day! Yes, you heard that right. They are going to keep my money for three months, even thought they have agreed to a refund. Is any other airline doing this? I can understand that they are busy. But three months? Seems a bit abusive, and seems like they need the cash, and have decided to allow their passengers to loan them money, interest free. This is an injustice, and I needed to call them out.Edited: 3:24 am, April 10, 2020 "
">> Within 90 day <<there is a difference between within 90 days and after 90- daysI was quoted 28 days by an airline and refund received in 3 days.I expect you will receive the refund long before the 3 month period and suspect the fact that many airlines are quoting long refund times is to stop passengers jamming their phone lines with ""where's my refund"" callsYou seem to have duplicated this on both Travelgenio and Qatar Airlines threads....both appear to be the wrong place"
"Valverde, ¿puede indicarnos su localizador?"
"Omer Y, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them (if allowed because they cancelled or the new policies) and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"

Hello Valverde. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days. Thank you for your cooperation.
"I wrote several mails to Travelgenio and no response, nothing. Both airports (in Luxemboirg and Waraw) are simply closed.

But they do not respond.Can anyone from you guys pick up the phone or reply my mail please??"
"Piotr:Skim this board and you will see many replies from TG.Generally they are working on refunds in order of flight date.

"Greetings dear representative of TravelGenio.I would like to ask you, how is it come, that your support department is ignoring our inquiry for almost a month now. On 18 Mar 2020, we've filled in the form and received the automatic reply with the ticket #3419339. Unfortunately, nobody contacted us in any way within two weeks. We've sent 2 more reminders. There was no result either.We've tried to call your UK support line, but got automatic operators reply ""The number you are using is not in service"".Since you are active in this forum section, please advice, how/where should be escalate the case and get attention from your support department.The inquiry is regarding one cancelled flight (VIE-VNO), which is a packaged of four-flight trip (2 flights to and 2 flights back in one ticket, we own 2 such tickets).Thank you.Edited: 6:40 am, April 14, 2020 "
"Travelgenio has been very clear that they are prioritising those who are due to travel in he next 72 hours. I doubt they have the resources to do anything more.Will they start to catch up? I don't know when, but they might at some point. We are in uncharted waters a the moment."
"Well, if they do now have the resources to provide the clients with the required services, the company has to make public announcements and inform it's clients about the new rules (if they are logical or obligatory due to context) and/or ask for the agreement. Otherwise, everything is managed by the local and international law. Which, in EU and/or UK states: if a company is unable to provide the services, it is required to make a refund of received funds for such services order within the next 15 days after receiving such request from the customer. If the company can not guarantee it's financial responsibility, one of the situation development ways is a filing for bankruptcy, which I hope will not happen. But it is a definite and most common option.Edited: 7:18 am, April 14, 2020 "
">> if a company is unable to provide the services, it is required to make a refund of received funds for such services order within the next 15 days after receiving such request from the customer<<How can Trevelgenio possibly do this when it is based in Spain and Spain is in total lockdown?"
"I don't think they have the resources, and won't for some time. They are hardly quick at the best of times, and while the lockdown in Spain has started to be gradually eased this week, I can't see anything in the news regarding people employed by rubbish travel sites being allowed to return to work."
"Oh wow, we have an EU/SPAIN expert from the other side of the world. Well hello there. Lock down means less or zero physical interaction, just in case our Australian friends didn't know. Every single internet based company is working. Yes - remotely, yes - not so quickly, yes - we understand the situation thus we waited so much already. However, this does not excuse the company from the guarantees they have to provide, or any other ethical communication, as an example. So, yes, please, don't put your expert opinion with no valid information on the topic. Thank you very much."

"RE Post 281 from Aleksej P. ( whose profile has ""gone on holiday"" so he maybe not see this anyway)Alekej you have no right to be so rude to a long term member of this forum like sydneynick in that way - do you think it is OK to join the forum, throw a few posts around and then feel entitled to offensive to a member with 13 years membership and over 100,000 contribution posts under his belt ?? If the answer to that is ""yes"" then no wonder your profile has been reported to the moderators - that sort of behaviour is not acceptable The only reason that I did not report your comments in Post 281 as offensive was so that others could see how rude you have been to sydneynick .For the future (if TA allows you back onto the site that is) kindly be more polite to other members and realise that ANYONE from ANY part of the worldwide community is just as entitled to you are to post on any forum that they wish (and to respond to your posts whether you like it or not). - you have no right whatsoever to tell another member who is using moderate language and making a valid point about Spain's' lockdown ( which is far stricter than the UKs) to stop postingEdited: 11:57 am, April 14, 2020 "

"@ Tilly41 (Post 288) - that is very odd - when I was writing my ""offended on behalf of sydneynick"" message I was trying to check Aleksej P.'s profile page and it wasn't there - (the ""this page is on holiday"" message was showing and nothing else) I rechecked 3 or4 times over the course of 10 minutes and every time you couldn't get to it so I thought that the moderators were having a look at his account! . Oh well, he is welcome to continue to post like everyone else provided he understands the rules of being civil and not sniffy about who he thinks should or should not comment on his posts!"
"287, MenorcaRegular, you have full right to report or not to report any post. I must admit I am really questioning your post in this thread, this is a complete off topic. I was provoked by a person, who has no idea what is going on in the region I AM IN, thus I have full right to express my dissatisfaction. Now, you, as a glorified user, make other users post more irrelevant comments on the topic. It's funny, how people can judge other actions and ignore their own actions. Have a good day."
"Dear TravelGenio, please specify the time frame, when does your support team plan to reply to the inquires, which are not urgent, but send a month ago. Also, how can a client escalate the case which could possible be ignored for a unspecified amount of time?As I mentioned before - we understand the situation, but we also require a provider to keep their promises and service quality. We already gave you two discounts - solved our travel situation on our own by investing our time, effort and funds, also prolonged the legal time for the refund two times. We expect the communication (ASAP) and a solution (later) on the canceled flight from your side.Edited: 5:50 pm, April 14, 2020 "

"I live in Lithuania and work more than 3 years in a multiple world wide travel services providing company, main office of which is in Spain, Tenerife. Are you implying you know how things are better than I do? Seriously, do you? Comments about how EU companies function in so called 'lock down' and how law works in our region from your side are incorrect. Arguing about that just makes you seem incompetent. And it doesn't really matter what an amazing contribute this or that user is. Remember the Menthos advert, sometimes it's really better to chew. Thank you for understanding. P.S. I didn't know TravelGenio was ES based, all the contact information suggests it's UK company. But, thank you for clarifying that.

Aleksej after spending over 3 years working in world wide travel services you still booked with Travelgenio? Doesn’t say much about you extensive knowledge.
"I didn't have any experience with TravelGenio earlier. At the moment I can say their online reservation system works very well, is functioning as expected. The complain I have is absence of support (not following the terms of use and complete absence of communication, except instant automated reply, not working official UK phone line). This makes me search other ways of reaching their staff, using other communication ways, like this public space of TripAdvisor, which I am thankful for."

I'm travelling with Turkish Airlines who are doing this free of any charges, but I'm suppose to contact Travelgenio first as it was booked through their site.This is really not a way to treat people during this period. I wouldn't recommend anyone booking through them as their customer service has been unhelpful, especially during a crisis like this. I'm disappointed and would think that we would be more helpful to one another during this difficult period."
"Tia, the airline may be doing changes free of charge but as you booked with a booking company you will likely be charged fees by them for doing that work for you. Have you looked on their website terms and conditions to see what fees you could be charged?If you browse this topic you will see contact details/email addresses they give out but there seem to be long delays and many people are having an issue getting in contact with them."

Some are going bankrupt, some are laying off all their staff. Online Travel Agents aren't considered ""essential businesses"" by most governments - those that still have ANY staff (and it appears that Travelgenio is one of them) are swamped trying to bug the airlines (who have the money) to refund, and then to process those refunds back to passengers.I wish you luck getting your refund, but I fear you need to temper your expectations...We are reading lots of tales of those that did not use a middle-man to book getting their refunds promptly - this is the price people pay for using these outfits, that we have been warning against using for years on here."

I understand that a refund will take time, but I have received absolutely no contact from Travelgenio, and I have emailed their customer service address several times to simply request a confirmation that I will, at some point, be reimbursed. Has anyone who had a flight through travelgenio that was cancelled by the airline on them had any information about a refund?Those of you who would like to criticize me for purchasing my tickets on travelgenio... why are you on this thread?"
"Dears I wish to arrange refund of my ticket as well (Booking reference: NN8TWA) as my flights were cancelled. Flights between 02-12 April were not possible as both airports (Luxembourg and Warsaw) were simply closed due to COVID-19 On Travelgenio page my flights are shown as ""Confirmed"" which is simply not true.It's not possible to call them. I sent mail on INFO@travelgenio.com address but without response since several days.Can anyone assist here please?"
"Thanks for reply.I added my booking reference (LO/NN8TWA) in another post. I saw their HELP page but it does not contain any address or contact apart from COVID-19 message. I tried to reach them via INFO@travelgenio.com but also without result. Understand massive demand for response these days, but at least automatic message that they look at the case could be helpful here.Best regards"
Kelly - people are not criticising you for your choice of agent. Rather they will point out that your choosing Travelgenio has made it more difficult and more costly to get a refund for your flights. It was your choice to choose an agent to book your tickets rather than booking tickets yourself.
"TravelGenio, if you do see this message, my booking reference for my Paris/ Tokyo trip that was cancelled it FDYBQK. Would love any information regarding the refund at all, even just a simple ""it is coming eventually but we don't know when"". In response to the person explaining that the criticism about our choice to book through TravelGenio is simply a response that gives context for why the refund process will be longer and more complicated... I'm pretty sure all of us know that... and people like you, who would clearly never make such a ""stupid"" decision (very condescending by the way...) are only taking the time to comment on a thread about TravelGenio to be trolls. I am not buying that it is out of a sheer desire to be helpful that someone who does not use TravelGenio comes onto the threads, many many pages in, just to continue saying ""If you're struggling to get your refund, well just so you know it's your fault"". You could perhaps consider doing something more positive & productive with your time. But I know that trolls aren't smart enough to get that (even if they may be ""smart enough"" to not purchase tickets through third parties ;))Edited: 6:10 pm, April 19, 2020 "
"Kelly - I don’t make my point to attack you, but to try to get over to others that using OTAs means committing to the terms and conditions that you sign up to in doing so. You presumably are now aware of the pitfalls but this is a public forum and maybe, just maybe, one or two other people might read the comments I and many others continue to make on here and avoid them in the future.Although I do wonder sometimes whether it’s worth it frankly."

"Hello travelgenio I've been contacting you as well for quite sometime now because I saw the notice from singapore airlines that they are giving considerations for those travelers who booked even before february 2020 as they are opening the ttickets until may 2021. I am one of those that has been affected by covid19 and had a no show because my country of destination is already on a lockdown. However, according to singapore airlines, if we booked to a 3rd party agency, we have to chase you to process our request. Since the time I've learned about it my calls and emails got no replies. I demand to have my ticket arranged with singapore airlines and have it opened until may 2021 as what their notice is all about. I'm already fed up!"
"You cannot ""demand"" anything I am afraid. Things will happen slowly and you HAVE to go through TG because that is who you booked through. If you had booked direct with the airline they would be happy to sort it out with you but the airline will not deal with you because you are only the passenger not their customer - that is TG who bought the flights from them. Unfortunately you chose to use an third party vehicle to book your trip (possibly without researching their reputation beforehand and possibly also without reading their T&Cs which you agreed to when booking) This means that they will need to handle your cancelled flight issues and also that it is very likely that they will charge you admin fees for doing it (read the T&Cs for details) Good luck but I suspect that nothing will happen in anything lie the timeframe you were hoping for"
"Well, anyone can demand whatever you want, but it doesn't mean that those demands will be met, lol!Travelgenio, who aren't very good normally, have more or less gone into hiding since travel collapsed due to the virus. i hope you'll learn a valuable lesson about the advantages of booking direct instead of through grotty third parties."
"Glenngeley G, Please contact us via the contact section of our site and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Take into account that our reply times have increased. cordially"
i have been trying to change the date of my booking due to arrival complications with the coronavirus pandemic. Havent had anyone confirm it was being processed.I tried calling i was on hold for 20 mins a person then took my general flight info put me back on hold for nearly 20 mins and hung up on me!. i need service!!
"I'm sure you have skimmed this thread, Dominic. You picked a bad company and they will get to you ""eventually"".Have you noticed that TG does post here fairly often and needs certain info from you in order to help?"
"Dominic Z, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Please contact us via the contact section of our site and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
My flight is this Sunday 26th of April and I've been CALLING to travelgenio but no answer. I just want a refund on my ticket.Please let me knowl..Thank you.
"Rita: Please read the thread before posting.Travelgenio has to ask the airline for a refund. When eventually this is provided, Travelgenio will deduct its fee and pass the rest on to you. As every travel-related office in the world is in meltdown right now, a realistic timeframe would be 2 or 3 months."
"Although I have sent emails like you instructed about a month ago, I have yet received ANY response. Our flight is in less than 72 hours. I ask that an agent calls me URGENTLY +972528992234"
Could you tell us your booking code Naama or the support ticket number?
"Putting your phone number on the internet is possibly a worse move than booking with TravelGenio, Naama."
At least Naama hasn't replied here with their booking code and support ticket number!
"I have also contact them even via mail, and all i got was automatic message. Turkish airline had cancelled my flight, and @travelgenio has written that I will get a refund when the main company decides to cancel. Whish,like I sadi, Tuskish did. NOW WHAT?!"
please contact me also i have booked two tickets via your agency (Zagreb-Istanbul)gugic.matea@gmail.com Thank you
"Please read the thread before you post, Matea. Travelgenio will have to ask Turkish Airlines for a refund. When this is received, Travelgenio will deduct its handling fee and send the rest to you.Every airline and travel agency in the world is in meltdown right now, and many are also in lockdown.

"Dear,same issue from my side, checked with Turkish Airline and got that i need to contact Travelgenio to arrange the refund. contact Travelgenio on their email (customer.service@travelgenio.com), but there is no answer yet... my flight is after two weeks (which is canceled) ...this is what i got from Turkish:Dear xxxxxxx ,First of all, we would like you to know that we are sorry for all inconveniences caused by the Coronavirus affecting the entire world.We have checked your reservation and have reviewed your feedback form.Your ticket has been issued by a travel agency. Accordingly; if you booked your ticket from a travel agency, every transaction related issue has to be handled by your agency also.Therefore, kindly contact your agency for your options.Thank you for your understanding.Sincerely yours,xxxxxxxCustomer RepresentativeTURKISH AIRLINES INC.Customer Contact Center"
"Nikola: I hope you get your refund.Even if you do, I hope you have learned to book directly with the airline in the future so you avoid these awful agencies.Tell your friends so they do not make the same mistake you made"
"Hi Nikola, We are currently managing the requests for refunds of all affected tickets, so that as soon as the airline approves such refunds, the amount will be refunded to the form of payment provided when making the booking.

"Hi,May I asked again the update about our request to refund or rebook our flight? yes, I received an email from your colleague and they told me that they will be sending me an update or the voucher if the airline replied to them. It's been 1 week again and I didn't receive an update, I've tried to email them back for 3x and no response. Our supposed flight was on April 21, but it pass by and until now no voucher or refund received. Booking code Travelgenio:17698105Booking code Amadeus: PF5ICT"
"Maffy:Every airline office and travel agent is in meltdown right now. It is taking many airlines weeks to issue refunds.A realistic timeframe for your refund would be 2 to 3 months, not one week."
"Hi Maffy, all info regarding the info provided by airline was sent the 3rd and the 10th under mail reference 3281551 to the mail used in the booking process. Any further details will only be provided as a reply to that chain. Refunds or vouchers have to be processed by airlines. RegardsEdited: 3:31 am, April 24, 2020 "
Have also tried several times emailing travelgenio and no reply. Constant phones calls to a dead phone number. Have been on to the airline and the flights have been cancelled but the refund has to go through travelgenio. Inexcusable really to have zero customer service at this time

">>Inexcusable really to have zero customer service at this time<<For heaven's sake! Travelgenio operates out of Spain, and that country is in total lockdown. How do you expect them to provide customer service when the Spanish government has closed their office?"
"Travelgenio code for this booking: 17034858,booking code: WLZUKH,Names: Naama Gutman Sharabi and Assaf Michael Gutman"
"And your point is ???? Naaoma , you have already been told previously on this thread that this is NOT a Travelgenio website - you need to continue to contact THEM directly not post requests to TG on an open travel forum which has nothing to do with the company It is also very risky publishing your personal booking details on an open public forum - you have no idea who is looking at your message !"
Naama Gutman you can contact us through customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will contact you asap. Take into account our reply time has increased. Regards
"I tried a few times as I said and no one answered! over a month ago, again in beginning of April. no answer through customer.service@travelgenio.com. and no answer when I called over the phone as well.

Hello. I was meant to fly Auckland to Doha to Dublin on 1st May 2020. I contacted Qatar and they told me the refund was issued to Travelgenio on 30th March 2020 so when can I expect to receive this since it has been over a month ?
Antonia: Please read the thread before you post. It is likely that your refund will take months to be processed.
"Antonia W, Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
Hi. My flight to Rome has been cancelled as well and Travelgenio changed my flight without informing me. The airline has confirmed that I qualify for a refund but I can't get through to Travelgenio. Does Travelgenio charge a service fee to process the full refund issued by the airline or will it reimburse the full amount?Thanks
"Read the dozens of threads, Sim. You will be lucky to get a personal e-mail, nevermind a voucher. No refunds.We have SO many threads about this awful company going back many years. A tiny bit of research before you gave them your money would have saved you many headaches. We've had thousands of complaints here in the past 2 months, and only 2 people have reported any positive info from the company."
"Sim103, Thank you for your comment. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our specialised agents."
"@ Sim103 - you asked ""..Does Travelgenio charge a service fee to process the full refund issued by the airline or will it reimburse the full amount?.."" the answers to those two questions are Yes and No.All admin fees are shown in the T&Cs that you signed up to when booking - it matters not whether you cancelled or if the airline did - if the airline requires you to go through Travelgenio to get your refund they will charge an admin fee for processing it"
"there aren't any fees deducted, Menorca, when there is no refund or voucher issued. 99.9% of posters here have not reported any refund or voucher or even a followup e-mail"
But Sim is absolutely certain that there is a refund coming from the airline which is why I mentioned the admin fee - whether he will ever see it is another thing entirely
"The specific question that Sim asked has been answered correctly. I don't think there's a high chance of Sim getting any refund at all, at least not any time soon, but perhaps they might get something at some yet to be determined point.It won't be the full amount, I;m pretty certain of that."
"I am absolutely disgusted by your company. I have a package booked to Cuba. Cuba have closed the borders and therefore we are not permitted to travel, along with virgin Atlantic cancelling all flights from Gatwick. I have attempted to contact travelgenio by email numerous times, with no reply. I have tried to contact them via phone and can’t get an answer, just an automated message saying fill out the contact form. There is no contact form to process a request. Your company is an absolute disgrace, the lack of communication is illegal. Having done a little research online, I understand that they are linked to an illegal parent comp at operating with illegal procedures. Make no mistake about this, THIS IS A SCAm COMPANY. I suggest to anyone in the same boat as me, and it seems there are many to proceed with legal action. They seem to have a policy in place where they will not speak to you unless your flight is due within the next 72 hours. This is a ploy so that you cancel late and they aren’t obliged to give a refund, DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRICK. Perdue then through small claims courts. I don’t only want my money back I would like to see the end of these cowboys. No morales whatsoever."
"Richard:We have threads here going back YEARS warning folks away from TravelGenio. You are preaching to the choir here. Your post isn't going to stop a single person from giving TG their money, as anyone who does a bit of research on the subject will find those 10,000 other posts here.You need to tell your friends, your Facebook contacts, Tweet about it, blog about it, etc, if you want to help anyone avoid what happened to you.By the way, lack of communication isn't illegal. It obviously doesn't hurt business as we have had over 100 threads started here in the past 60 days by TG customers."

"Hi, I would like to know my update on our refund? until now no actual response and no clear update, they will always be saying once the voucher receive they send us. Until when are we waiting for the voucher? I've been waiting for about 2months now and our flights have been cancel since the last month of April. Your customer service only emails me 3x and every time I reply on that email they will never never never respond on my email again unless I posted here on the forum and you are forcing them to email me. How frustrated your service and until now no voucher or refund receive? I didn't even receive a call from your helpdesk and even I'm calling your hotline number they just hang me and wasting my load to call your customer service. I need my refund/voucher as you promise because I need it urgently to book my flight because I have been stuck here for so long and I need to come back to my country.Booking Number: PF5ICTBooking code Travelgenio:17698105"

"I have several flights tomorrow, May 12, that I need to cancel. We've attempted to call the customer service line, but the call is dropped each time after being placed on hold. Our ticket information is below:Booking code: 17607058Since it looks like Travelgenio is monitoring this thread, can someone advise on how we can cancel this?Edited: 11:49 am, May 11, 2020 "
I would follow the advice in post 393 above. I'm very doubtful it will make much difference but at least it's something you could try.
"I was able to get through to a representative and cancel one of my flights. They're only allowing you get into the queue to speak to someone if your flight is ""upcoming"", which I think they've defined as ""less than 3 days"". I downloaded Skype because the rates were good (about $.02/min). My call was dropped several times when going through the automated system when going through the route for canceling/modifying an existing flight. I tried several different routes through the automated system, and found that inquiring about ""frequent flyer"" and waiting for 10 mins on hold, I was finally able to get through to someone.Edited: 1:26 pm, May 11, 2020 "
"GOOD info, Nick!"
Many thanks for your feedback. We are glad to know that you have had been able to solve your cancellation with our services. Regards.
"I don't think Nick said his problem was solved, TG. Just that he was able to speak to a person. Small victories should be celebrated, but you still need to reimburse him"
"Travelgenio said it could take up to 30 days for the reimbursement, so we'll keep an eye out for that. I received a cancellation confirmation email minutes later, so it looks like it's been canceled.While on that same call, I attempted to cancel another one of my flights (which is in 4 days), and while the representative was looking that one up, the call was dropped. So I'll be trying again in a few days with the same method that worked today...fingers crossed"
"Hello. In view of unresolved COVID-19 pandemic, I would like to request a refund for My Silk Air ticket (Travelgenio booking no. 17120576),Per Singapore airline website, they allowed to FREE of charge refund whole amount to customer, however as the ticket was booked trough travel agent, I need travelgenio help to proceed on this( https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/precautionary-measures/covid-19-travel-waiver-policy/)Your assistance on this will be greatly appreciated.FYI: I had email customer.service@travelgenio.com several times, but no reply is received so far"
Read reply 391. That will get you a canned reply from TG. Then you will go into the queue of tens of thousands of people who chose to give their money to this dreadful company. Hope for a personal response later this year.
"Hi Storyteller381544, We would ask you to check how to contact us to register your petition (with the booking code in the subject and the mail used in the booking process). Once done, our agents will contact you as soon as the actual situation allows. Due to the actual amount of petitions, reply times have increased. Thanks"
Still no resolution to this and still no contact. I understand there is a heightened demand in your customer service at this time but my flight departure time is almost a month ago. Surely I should have been contacted by now! I have been on to the ECC and they are looking into the case.
"Document your attempts to reach them, Noel, and file a dispute with your credit card company"
"Noel B, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
I'm having the same issue. This company seems to be full of it. I have been waiting fir any answer for MONTHS. The best part is that when I check My trips for my cancellation status it says that my flight doesn't even seem to be cancelled on their site????
"Read post 406, Roosa. And promise to do RESEARCH before you give your money to bad companies in the future. There are warnings here about this company going back many years"

Can someone from Travelgenio please assist me with cancelling a booking and getting a refund or possibly a voucher to redeem at a later stage when the COVID19 crisis is over? Finding it extremely difficult to make contact with Travelgenio. Been sending emails but no reply and the info on the website as to how to cancel a booking due to COVID 19 is very vague. My country does not allow air travel at the moment. I need to get this sorted please.
"Yolandi:Read the post above yoursThat's the only thing you can do, then wait and hope.You picked possibly the worst company to give your money to. We have posts here dating back many years telling you not to use them."
Thank you for your reply. Yes I did see that post yesterday and followed the steps. Still waiting for a response. I realize that I should have done more research before i booked with them. Will definitely be more careful in the future. Did you ever get any feedback/refund from travelgenio?
"We have three reports of replies from TravelGenioWe have nearly ten thousand complaints.If you can’t get a refund by filing a dispute with your credit card company you likely have a very long wait with a low chance of satisfaction.You basically gave your money to a random stranger on the street who promised you a good deal and didn’t t ask any questionsEdited: 6:24 am, May 27, 2020 "

It leads to nothing and I am still waiting for a response. Please, I need proper communication from you. It would be nice to not have this conversation over Tripadvisor, or is this the only way you communicate with your clients?"
"Yolandri:that is the only reply you will get from TG. They have made that post 5271 times. No one gets a personal reply here, and as mentioned, only 3 posters here have reported hearing anything beyond this reply.Dispute with your credit card now."

"I too have been trying to contact @TravelGenio for more than a month now without any reply. I need to postpone my flight from Zurich to Montreal that is in 3 days!! When I call, the machine says my flight isn't in the upcoming days therefore they can't help because it doesn't have priority but it's literally in less than 72 hours."

"Pamela: you will receive a form letter and then nothing. Ultimately you will have to dispute with your credit card to get any money back. You will be very sorry you chose this company, if not already"
"I have the same problem - I can't get refund from my tickets. I bought 3 tickets from Poland to Korea and 3 return tickets, before coronavirus was in europe, I asked TravelGenio for refund beacuse Polish Airlines LOT canceled my flights. The request was accepted but I still haven't received the money.I wrote a lot of emails, tried to call many international TravelGenio numbers but no one answered. It's so frustrating."
"Expect nothing, Jon. You chose to give your money to a well known bad company. Why?Dispute with your credit card company"
"I had the worst experience ever with Travelgenio and will never use it again!My flight was cancelled at the beginning of the COVID emergency in Italy. I immediately tried to contact Travelgenio (by email, phone was impossible to reach)They answered me last week, after more than 2 months, to tell me that my flight cancellation was not linked to COVID (while Alitalia sent me a confirmation of it) and I was due to no reimboursementLuckily Alitalia granted me a voucher after just a 10 min call!NEVER AGAIN AND DO NOT RELY ON THEM!"
"Thank you for your comment Noris. We would like one of our agents to study your case to see airline guidelines for your tickets.

"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. I tried contacting them for a MONTH to postpone my flight. My flight is tomorrow and suprise suprise, I wasn't able to postpone it. When I called, the machine said my flight isn't soon enough to talk to an actual person and when I sent emails to customer service, a robot replied with a link that didn't work. When I logged into the travel genio website with my email, my previous flights appeared but not the one I wanted to postpone. The only way I could see my booking was by clicking directly on the confirmation email I received from TravelGenio after my purchase. Travel Genio is an absolute scam, I will never purchase tickets from them again and I don't recommend anyone to do so either. Save yourself the trouble and money waste."
"Same reply as to your post from the other day. You picked an awful company to give your money to. We have YEARS of complaints on this board.File a dispute with your credit card company, or be prepared to wait for many months to hear from TG.We haven't had a single person post here in a month that they heard from this companyTell your friends not to use them, not us. We already know. you need to reach people who, like you, don't do any research and just jump at ""cheap"" faresEdited: 5:19 pm, June 02, 2020 "

"Travelgenio,In regards to your response to Noris (#428), there's no need to tell him to email you with blah blah instruction about the 8-digit confirmation code which only will bring him to a page that requires him to clink on a link, check for his email and return (again) to another page about his flight details. He has his voucher and case is closed. Good for him.For you to repeat the same message to all of the 10,000+ dreaded customers here only proves that you are really incapable of handling the situation. What a shame."
if nothing else it confirms that it is some sort of automated reply service - if TG cannot read and understand the post it is referring to properly there is little point in them posting a reply!
Almost 4 months now and until now no concrete refund to our request about our flight. This travel genio scam to our money and they never resolved our request.
"We keep telling you that, Maffy.Have you disputed with your credit card yet?"
"Yes, I did. I already filed a dispute with my credit card. Hopefully, I can still get my money back even it takes a while. I already surrender to travel genio and I've booked my new flights directly to airlines. I will never never never book again on this Travel Genio."
Best post of the day!
"Maffy, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves and makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
So TG: Have any airlines issued refunds to you? I ask because we haven't seen anyone get a refund from you in a very long time.
"I am very disappointed with Travelgenio. I have purchased in last 5-7 years at least 50-70 tickets, and if there was issue they always helped me. Now I have 3 cancelled reservations and they dont care, do not answer the phone, do not reply to emails nothing. Their email customer.service@travelgenio.com is totally useless. After you submit 1 request, you are not able to submit another one on different reservation.I would highly discourage anyone doing business with them in the future. It is not worth it, Not worth the time, money and all the stress."
"I am doing it now too. Booked directly with the airline. These cowboy sites do not have much future ahead of them. Everyone now can see, how selfish they are. When there is an issue, they put their hands away from problems. I liked them previously a lot. But after them showing their real face, I will never use them again."
"Hope you saved enough money over the years to cover these losses, Alex."
"Ales, everyone has been able to see how very poor the likes of Travelgenio are for years. While there will be those who won't use them ever again, there will also be plenty who will, mostly because they don't even think about checking for warnings.No, I'm afraid they will just see what they think is a cheap price and leap in without further thought.What surprises me most is that your good l;uck with them lasted so long."
"Have same issue! First it was not possible to reach Travelgenio when I needed to cancel my flight because of Covid, so I reached airlines directly and asked to cancel flight, but not to do refund, because I was planing to fly anyway after borders are open and will just book new dates. Now after few months I tried to reach Tarvelgenio to make new booking, their application from in web page didn't work so tried to call, no success...then I reached airlines directly and found out that airlines have refunded all the money to Travelgenio some time ago. So it was big surprise as I didn't ask for refund. Now I don't have new tickets, no money and Travelgenio don't replay in any possible way. Don't think they have intention to do it. Does any one know how to report for such cases, should I do it in local Police where agency is registered?"
Ingars - Apply for a refund from your card provider. TG will not help you. There are thousands of posts for this company all with the same issues.
Thanks!
"Ingars, We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
"You are joking, right? I have sent emails, filled applications, called, and did even cancelations by myself directly with airlines, because you didn’t bother to replay to me. Better spend time answering requests, emails in your system not showing fake interest and care in TripAdvisor!!!"
"File with your card. You can register with TG like they suggest but you won’t get a personal reply from them No one hasGoing back to your original question, the police can’t help you. What happened here was you chose to,give your money to an incompetent company. That’s not a crime, and it is easily avoided if you do research before giving away your money to strangers.We have YEARS of warnings here about this company . Do research before you give strangers your moneyEdited: 4:30 am, June 16, 2020 "
"Don’t agree. It’s criminal responsibility take money without my approval, at least in Europe Union. :) I understand if they don’t receive money from airlines, but they did thanks to my proactive actions calling directly to airlines and asking to cancel. And Travelgenio took action to request money from airlines but not paying it back to me. So it’s criminal charge to take others money without their permission. Anyway I’m filling application in necessary institutions for fraud and inappropriate commerce practice. Will let you guys know progress. Maybe at least make them to lose license. Will see."
"You gave them your money willingly.There Is no law against incompetence.They have disappointed tens of thousands of customers, we have proof here and yet they continue to operate?Does the term Caveat Emptor mean anything to you?I would LOVE to see them shut downs. And what would happen next is you and everyone else would just give your money to kiwi or eDreams or the next “cheap” airfare company on the listEdited: 5:01 am, June 16, 2020 "
"Ingars If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
"Good luck in your encounters with the Spanish justice system. Please let us know how you get on, and when you discover whether selling tickets on line from a base in Spain even requires a licence."
Hey Igar how did you cancel directly with the airline? they don't allow me! they say I have to get in touch with travelgenio and they talk to sales with Airindia... whatever! IMPOSSIBLEDo you think I can proceed only witht the airline? any tip?
"Sorry, don't think we speak same language.. I'm not talking about bad service, I speak about stealing money - it's a big difference. Yes, gave money in exchange of tickets. If no tickets, then should be money. And thanks for opinion, i will try my luck and spend my time on doing reporting everywhere it's possible. For me it's not about money anymore. And no need to comment that it's useless to do it, I will anyway."
"Hey! I did cancelation with Qatar Airlines, they allowed me to do it. Unfortunately I was able only to cancel my flight, but not rebook or request refund, that have to be done through agency.."
"Will do Andy!Edited: 5:33 am, June 16, 2020 "
"Ingars by all means contact the police where you are and in Spain if you are convinced that Travelgenio are criminals. But first, please get your card provider involved if you haven't already done so. Hopefully, when you say filing claims with various institutions, that's what you mean, not making complaints to EU authorities or instructing lawyers to take legal action.My focus at this point would be on getting my money back."
"Maria, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
"ngars, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
"After some days, my mail referring the cancellation of my Turkish airline flight from Berlin to Istanbu was answered. They wrote that I can get my refund but I have to pay 30 EUR fee per passenger for administrative cost, which the airline established. I don´t understand why I should pay this fee because the airline cancelled the flight (Convid-19). The EU Flight Compensation Regulation said, that the he customer must be reimbursed the entire cost and not only a part of it if the airline cancelled the flight. I´ll only accept a full refund. Otherwise I´ll contact my legal insurance and give this facts to my lawerEdited: 9:02 am, June 17, 2020 "
"I suggest that you instead read the TG terms and conditions you agreed to at the time of your booking which would have included a provision to charge an administration fee. I would be fairly sure that the EU Regulation you refer to applies only to airlines, and not online ticket floggers."
HiI took the advice by emailing Travelgenio customer service staring reference number and I got a reply saying that there was no reference found with that number. Very disappointing. I have absolutely no way of contacting them and it’s been 8 weeks since my flights were cancelled. Funny that money can be taken instantly from thousands of people daily when booking flights but you have to wait months to get a refund. Will never use Travelgenio again because it’s impossible to contact them.
"Dirk and ashleen: We have well over 100 threads here going back years telling you to STAY AWAY from this company.5 minutes of research would have saved you months of heartache and your money.At this time your best option, if travel insurance won't help, is to initiate a credit card chargeback.TG does not respond to e-mails, letters, or phone calls. No one here has reported a personal reply or a refund in months, and we've had well over 10,000 complaints.Don't give your money to strangers in the future before researching to make sure they are legit. Had you done so this time you wouldn't be posting here. Book direct with the airlines!"
"We will indeed see Ingars (post 350) , but I think that in your irritation you have overlooked an important fact which is that by inserting TG into your arrangements THEY are the airlines customer not you - this means that the airline HAS to repay whoever bought the ticket from them not the passenger, Do you know for a fact that the airline HAS refunded TG already (and when) or are you just assuming that they have done so ? An airline agreeing to the refund and the actual process of refunding the money to the agent who bought the tickets seem to be two distinctly separate processes, and until TG has received the reimbursement it will do nothing to start the (horribly slow by all accounts) process of getting around to repaying you .In the current situation every agent good or bad is overwhelmed with refund claims and are unlikely to pay up immediately .As others have already said, YOU chose to use an intermediary who does not have a great reputation even in normal times , you could have booked direct with the airline had you wanted to but did not, and as a result you are now finding that the bargain that apparently attracted you isn't such a bargain after all If you are insistent on trying to go down the legal route, it is very important to understand exactly what ""Fraud"" is - it is not the same as incompetent actions by a very long chalk. On this forum people love to bandy the Fraud word around whenever they are disgruntled, but in most cases the problem they are upset by does NOT fall within the legal definition of ""fraud"" . Firms like TG are very careful to ensure that their T&Cs mean that the operate within the law and being incompetent and/or really slow to connect with customers does not make a company ""fraudulent"" The police will not be interested if you approach them and when you eventually get your money from TG please do not expect to get back 100% of what you paid - because when agreeing to their T&Cs when booking you agreed to pay their service/admin fees which seem to be 50 Euros per passenger plus any fees charged by the airline/hotels etc -see …travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and… . Good luck - please tell us how you get on this and how long it actually takes you to get it resolved .Edited: 10:17 am, June 17, 2020 "
"Ashleen C, please check you are using the same mail as in the booking process as it will recognise the relation between mail and booking id and send the link automatically. Regards"
"Hi everyone.I also had no luck trying to get to them by phone or email. Try login in to Travelgenio webpage with your email (same email you used for buying tickets) and then go to customer service and ask a question through their platform. I got an answer in 10 days (I had a question regarding my trip because I didn't know what will happen to it because of corona situation). There might be a problem though: I don't know if you can login if the flight or tickets were already canceled?!?! In my case the flight still had status 'confirmed' (tickets were for late August).Then, I got an email one day (a month ago) from TG that the airline changed our flight and that I have to confirm the change. Well I didn't confirm anything because I logged in to airline website and reserved our seats etc. so for me, that was the confirmation (I don't have much experience so I thought that was it :D). Last week I got another email from TG asking me what I want to do: confirm the change and pay for agency fee or get a refund (yes, they actually offered me a refund, saying because of the flight schedule being changed, the airline can in some case refund the money). Because of the current situation with covid19 and because I wasn't able to get 2 extra days off at work to get on that flight I chose a refund and 2 days later the money was back on my credit card. Believe it or not, I actually got a 95% refund for my tickets (it's actually 30 EUR admin fee per person) and I must say it was pretty pretty quick . I know that in this situation the changes were made by the airline not by me and maybe that's the reason I got the refund... Well, I quess I am 1 of 10.000 so I consider my self a very lucky person. I just want to say that they actually have customer support, just getting to them is a hassle.. I've learned my lesson: From now on I'll always book directly with airline."
"You are one in ten thousand indeed. Funny how you found TA to post about this after the fact. So weird that you would think to look for a place with all these complaints to post your tale of victory.Edited: 7:01 am, June 18, 2020 "
No it's not weird actually. I had a really frustrating experience with TG in april and I've been checking this forum since then. Because I got my money back I decided not to go into details and trash talk but just give people some hope. I'll PM you so you can check that i'm not BSing you.
I was just thinking if I ever see a post saying they have had a refund off TG I will faint with shock and then I spotted this. It took me 20 minutes to recover.
"Many thanks for your feedback APTrader. Our agents are doing their best to be able to give support to the huge amount of queries we have been receiving during last months. Sometimes it takes a lot of time to be able to manage it with airlines, which are also working hard to solve all this situation. Regards"
"AP Trader did PM me. Said his original post in this thread was #225Quoted here:---------------------------------------------------------------------I got an email couple of days ago:""We are contacting you to inform you that due to the global crisis resulted from the expansion of Coronavirus, your flight has been cancelled.We are currently managing the requests for refunds of all affected tickets, so that as soon as the airline approves such refunds, the amount will be refunded to the form of payment provided when making the booking. We will continue to keep you informed of the progress of the refund process.We are sorry for the inconvenience this situation beyond our control may cause you.""I cancelled all my bookings, trips and everything because of that e-mail but when if I check the airline or even travelgenio it doesn't look like the flight has been canceled. What should I do? Tickets are actually for August 2020.Best regards--------------------------------------------------------------------------I have mentioned here that we had 2 claims of refunds and 1 claim of a personal contact. This seems to be the personal contact. The fact that this is the same person who got the contact on one hand makes this look legit. The fact that this person's flights weren't scheduled to go for another two months when we all have seen hundreds of posts from TG that ""they are handling refunds in the order of flights"" and ""do not contact us until 3 days before you travel"" makes this look like a total setup to me.Since both those options are possible, in my mind, I'm going to go for the tie-breaker the 10,000 other posters here who have reported zero contact and zero refund and say this is a setup. TG's really fast reply thanking him for the feedback is just icing on the cake.I could well be wrong. I often am. And if I am, well, 9,999 more customers to satisfy and I will gladly eat my hat, crow, and anything else."
"One swallow certainly doesn't make a summer, even if the poster is genuine. And I also have my doubts about that."
"Hello travelgenio team,can you at least be informative and respond to me about the refund, I totally understand that this is difficult situation for all of us but if you would Infrom about the refund policy I can at least hope that my money will be returned to me.my flight was scheduled on 22nd march from India to Germany and it was cancelled 3 days ago because of corona, eversince I didn't hear anything from your side, its already been 3 months,can you please inform me about the refund process.thank you.Edited: 3:04 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"Sanjay:Post 447 is the only reply you will get from TG on this forum.You picked a company with very bad customer service to give your money to. We have been warning people away from using them for many years.You can try a bank card chargeback, or you can wait and hope that eventually you see a refund."

"Hello Travelgenio,I had flights to Toronto booked from 22nd May - 7th June 2020. Due to government advise from the world Health organisation we were not permitted to travel to Canada on those dates. I have been trying to contact Travelgenio but am frustrated as i cannot get through to anyone, via telephone or email, i keep being directed to fill out a contact form which does not exist, the website directs me to my trips with no contact form option. When i go to my booking i am told i cannot claim a refund as the flight was not cancelled, (which is incorrect as on the 22nd May i checked the Gatwick departures and my scheduled flight was not even listed). So this flight was cancelled but there was no cancellation email sent out and in My Trips this flight is not showing as cancelled!I understand that the customer service teams are extremely busy right now, but all i want is some reassurance that at some point in the near future i will be receiving my refund of £800. Please can someone reply as this is causing me a huge deal of unnecessary stress and anxiety.Many thanksChristine D"
Christine:The 2 posts directly above yours are the only advice available for you.This is a terrible company and we have warning threads here going back YEARS.Follow the instructions in those posts and best of luck to you. You really need to do research before you give your money to random companies.

"Christine - this is not a conduit to TravelGenio - it is a public chat forum ! Have you checked with the airline about whether the flight was actually cancelled or not? If not do it now because you need to know - there is a huge difference between YOU not being able or being disinclined to go and the flight actually being grounded - if it was, then the airline has to reimburse the cost of the tickets purchased and if it wasn't then because you will not get a refund from the airline, there is no point chasing Travel Genio about it anyway. TG will not be able to help if the flight went ahead because your contract with them was to provide tickets and that is what they did ! If you simply did not use those tickets because you knew that you were not going to be allowed into Canada or because you were disinclined to travel because of FCO advice, then you need to contact your travel insurers!Edited: 12:48 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Trying to contact TG through these forums will only increase your stress and anxiety, sorry Christine. Especially when the hapless bot pops up with it's normal templated nonsense. You might feel initially reassured by the bot appearing, but that won't last long."
"Christine D, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Hello,The outbound flight did not go ahead, i know this as i checked the departure board at Gatwick for the 22nd May and the arrivals in Toronto where we were destined to land and our booked Scheduled flight was not listed on either departure board at Gatwick or Pearson Int in Toronto for the times that i had booked. This indicates that the departure flight did not go ahead and was cancelled, yet when i log in to travelgenio bookings and check in My Trips there is no mention of anything being cancelled. The outbound to flight to Toronto was grounded which means that i am entitled to a full refund. I have also spoken to my Insurance company who said that i am entitled to a full refund from Travelgenio.The insurance company said that they could also help me but would need a confirmation of the flights being cancelled ,and as i have already explained above the flight status on my trips is indicating otherwise? The only explanation i have for this, is if the scheduled return flight on 7th June did go ahead and that is why the the trip is still indicating that this went ahead which may be causing the problem?Also i dont see why i should have to go through my Insurance company when i have been advised that TG should be refunding me?"
Thank you i will give this a try.
"Hi Christine,You say ""Also i dont see why i should have to go through my Insurance company when i have been advised that TG should be refunding me?"". I'm sorry but that is your insurance company advising you, not the T&Cs informing you. If the flight was cancelled and you took no action to cancel, a refund should be payable from the airline to TG to you minus applicable service fees. You'd almost think the insurance company are trying to steer you away from a claim wouldn't you?"
"Christine - checking with airports is not the same as checking with THE AIRLINE. Contact them - ask which of the two flights you were booked to travel on were actually cancelled and at the same time ask them to confirm whether any refund has been processed for either ticket yet and if so when it was sent to TG . Armed with that info and evidence you may be able to start to move forward !Edited: 7:35 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Christine,Just a thought. By any chance did you happen to cancel your flights when you found out you were not able to travel? This is irrespective of whether the flight went ahead or not."
I emailed to initiate my refund from TravelGenio 3 months ago with confirmation that the refund was in process. There has been no update on the website and 3 months later I still have not received the refund. I called the airline and they said no refund has been initiated on my tickets.
Dispute with your credit cardDon’t use terrible companies like this in the future.
"Xian C, refunds depend on the time airline authorise and manage them. Due to the actual situation, it is taking a longer term than usually. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"Xian, TG are a terrible company who take far too long to pass on refunds, but it is at least correct that everything is taking much longer at the moment, even for other, better companies.N_T's advice re your card provider is good. I can't see involving them being slower than waiting for this lousy outfit to get around to you."
"I called the airline and they said Travelgenio never even initiated the refund with them. 3 MONTHS AGO. The lack of communication is abhorrent. Why do I have to contact you on tripadvisor and not on your actual channels. I will email again like you said, but I don't have much hope as they have not responded to any of my emails in the past 2 months."
"Yeah, thanks. I will reach out to to the card company today. Frustrating as in other forums people are getting refunds, or atleast showing that they are working on it."
"Do you mean people are getting refunds through other agents? If so, I think you're right. But there is very little evidence of many Travelgenio customers getting their money back.Personally, I think they laid off almost all of their staff or at least sent them home and all but closed their operations down, as it all reeks of a business that is run by one person in the bedroom or kitchen at the moment."
I am currently in Thailand. And had several flights cancelled (because of covid). No problem to get the money back. Now I booked a flight with travelgenio 29.07.2020 BKK -Frankfurt. With Turkish airlines . I got a message from Turkish airlines over a week ago that this flight is cancelled. (Covid) Nothing from TG no notice nothing over their page my flight still showing all fine . What the ....? No chance to speak to them nothing . Any chance to get my money back ? These are criminals? Until few days ago they still offered the same flight for sale even I got notice already that it's cancelled
"We have nearly 20,000 complaints here about TG going back years.You can’t just give your money to random companies on the internet! You have to do research!I expect you might get a refund by the end of the year. They might deduct fees. Or you might get nothing.Your flight is still four weeks away. Keep trying to reach them, but expect nothing. Eventually you should file a dispute with your credit card"
"And I would also like to add, that it is entirely possible, that the amount they charged the traveler, bears no resemblance to the amount they were charged by the airline. So if the traveler was charged $1000 for a ticket, and the ticket flogger was able to buy it for $900, then how much do you think the traveler would be refunded? Its no wonder that there are so few refunds being made by these online ticket floggers. Someone suggested that they have probably laid off their staff and closed up shop."

But are you sure there will be a refund ? Or should I contact my credit card company ?
"If airline authorises it, it will be refunded. It depends on them and their policy and ticket restrictions. Regards"

I have had the same problem two weeks into lockdown I phoned thier number someone was on the other end and put phone down it was showing on my mobile phone as call was to Spain. They definately do t want to speak to anyone. I will try ahsin as I am supposed to travel next month to the Caribbean just under £4000 for the family of 4 flights. I would rather prospone the trip this year or get my money back.

"@ Remeaise (Post 506) . You are in a difficult position . You do not have long to sort this out if you are due to travel next month and TG are notorious for being hard to contact and slow to act. They will also charge you fees for processing any refund or amendment ( this was covered in the T&Cs you agreed to when booking) .Have you checked with the airline that the flights are still scheduled to fly? If not, you should eventually get a refund (but I do mean eventually - airlines themselves take forever to refund even if one is due because of a flight being grounded, and then there will be the dreadful TG delays for processing it even further so it will take months). IF the flight is still scheduled to fly, then it depends on the type of ticket you purchased whether the airline will accept any amendment but unless your tickets were fully refundable ones you will not get a refund simply because you no longer fancy going anymore - the best offered is likely to be a credit voucher or to transfer to another date ( paying any difference in the fare cost)  The countries of the Caribbean are currently no longer listed by the FCO as not recommended for non essential travel sby British travellers, so your travel insurance will not pay out if you simply change your mind about going.I recommend that you currently check the airline's website to find out if they are offering any options to reschedule (you will not be entitled to a refund simply because you are now disinclined to travel) and whether you can arrange that direct with them ( many airlines will not let you as TG is your agent and TG is the airlines customer not you"
"I had airplane tickets for April and we couldn't fly due to the virus country block and i reported this to them and they said 6-8 weeks for a refund. It's been 12 weeks and no refund. I been emailing them, calling them and no answer on when my refund is due. After calling many times the international number and the USA number and holding for 10 min they hung up!!! This company is a fraud and I am reporting them to my credit card i paid with which is my Mastercard."
"Hi Mona, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase.

"Some of my flights have been cancelled and it is impossible to get to talk to someone at their customer service for a refund: they make you wait for 12 min and then the call ends every time. I’ve spent hours on this for several days. Moreover, it’s impossible to submit a ticket online regarding my issue: a message shows up saying that I have already submitted one when I never did. I’m extremely disappointed.@travelgenio worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. If I won’t receive an answer in due time I will proceed with legal means to receive a refund plus compensation."
"Bruno: There are hundreds of threads about Travelgenio and some 20,000 complaints. Nobody is getting any useful contact, and taking legal action would be throwing good money away after bad."
"Hi Bruno, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Good luck with a refund, Bruno. There won't be any extra compensation.We have over 20,000 complaints about this company here going back YEARS. If you had spent 1% as much time researching this company as you have trying to contact them we wouldn't be having this conversation.Have you tried going thru your bank card to get your money?"
"@ Mona ( Post 509) if you couldn't fly in April because of a ""country block"" as you call it (I assume you mean an entry restriction imposed by the country that you intended visiting) , then you may well not get a refund from the airline anyway. Unless a flight itself is completely grounded (many flights still run but due to Covid.19 entry restrictions certain passengers find that they could no longer use their tickets because the destination country will not let that particular nationality of passenger in) , then the fact you could not/did not wish to fly on it is a matter for your travel insurance to deal with not TG . During the height of the Covid19 travel disruption some airlines contacted customers offering them an option to reschedule if they wished , but that would have been before departure date and if a flight was not ""cancelled"" completely, once the departure date has passed then no refund or credit is likely to be due to anyone that did not fly on it. Unless the tickets you bought via TG were expensive fully flexible ones (unlikely as TG is an outfit which flogs cheap non-refundable tickets) then unless the flight you had seats on did not take off at all, there is only a very limited set of circumstances in which any airline will refund anything other than airport taxes if they chose to cancel. When, from where and where to were you supposed to be flying ? Did you approach TG to cancel the tickets before the airline got in touch about any risk of cancellation/rescheduling, or did you wait until you were notified by the airline that the flights were grounded and invited to apply for a refund or to rebook for new dates and only THEN approach TG to sort it all out for you ? The timing of what precisely happened and when is crucially important , because even if in the end the flights WERE grounded, if you had already jumped the gun and given TG cancellation instructions, then your instructions to your agent to cancel would simply be regarded as a disinclination to travel and the bad news in that instance is that will mean that you may well not be entitled to anything back from the airline in which case you need to rely on your insurance cover to recover your losses . You need to supply a lot more information before anyone on this forum can possibly follow what happened and when in order to comment about your situation . Having used a third party to book tickets you are bound by TGs T&Cs and few airlines will deal direct with you and expect your to go via your agent . Unfortunately you chose to use an OTA which has years of ""less than perfect"" reviews so it is not clear why you chose them at all. I hope that you read their T&Cs carefully during the booking process and are aware of the €50 p.p.admin fee that TG charges for handling any amend or cancelation. Unfortunately the problems you have experienced are unlikely to amount to ""fraud"" - horrible delays are more likely to simply just be typical of this poorly managed outfit which has had a dreadful reputation for poor service and long delays for years TBH I do not understand why anyone uses this company unless they have naively fallen for ""cheap fare"" offers and completely failed to research the company's reputation. Everyone has a personal responsibility to be savvy about handing over their money and to take care to understand what they are signing up to. Sadly if you did not do enough research, you will not be the first person to be wooed by the cheap fare fairy's promises nor the lastEdited: 9:50 am, July 27, 2020 "
i have same problem its been 4 months and i still didnt get my refund i dispute so travelgiano send me email that cancel dispute and we give u refund.but after 3 weeks they not give me refund and i send them 5 email non of the reply .now i m going to bank this friday to subpmet all the email i send and they send em to open the case again
why not all we have problem repot it to somehwer in public court
"“ repot it to somehwer in public court”—-It needs someone to take the initiative and start a case. Many write here in forums about doing it, but no one appears to have the courage in their convictions."
"Ali: Lots of advice in the pasts above yours, and in the other 199 threads about this company. Take 10 minutes and skim the recent posts for good ideas.Where would you take them to court? On what charges, exactly?"
i dispute it from bank and they email that if u cancel u r dispute we give u refund so i cancel it and now they not replying my email so i just call bank to open case they told me brinf all emails u send them or they send it to u and we dispute it again
but airline say we not get any refund request from TG
Pick better companies in the future. Let your bank credit card fight with them this time.
"Ali s, We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
"Who,how and why didqldMWlxQUj get away with spamming the forumsSS"
No one is answering call..There is just music nothing else..I tried so many times using hotline but couldn’t get connected to human.
"That is their business model, Urmi. Zero customer service to give you a price a few dollars less than booking direct. It's always been their way.. Follow the instructions in post 523 and you should get a refund eventually. Or not. They are a terrible company with over 20K complaints here. Do research before you spend money!"
"I hope it is a refund you're after, Urmi, not help in rebooking a flight or something similar. At least you should get a refund somewhere along the line. If you need some other type of assistance then I don't think you're going to get it."
"Urmi M, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Ive been trying to get through, literally for months!! I’m always left on hold and then the line clicks dead. This is disgusting and I’m due a much needed refund. Travelgenio, you should be doing better than this! I’d be better of trying to get through to the queen!!"
When will I get my refund!! I’ve had zero communication from yourselves.
It’s really bad that I have to find my answers on Trip advisor rather than from Travelgenio via email or on their website. Not very professional
"And when will I receive a reply?? I’m currently on hold now for over 20 minutes, costing me a fortune and I know that the phone will click dead in another 20 minutes. But I’ll keep trying."
"You won't get thru. Providing customer service was never in their business model.If you book with them and EVERYTHING goes perfectly with weather, and equipment and health, and everything is on time, you might save a few dollars with them.If any single thing goes wrong you are up the creek without a paddle.We have over 20,000 complaints here about them. 5 people have come back and said they got refunds, so it's not a zero chance of a refund, but chances are low!"
"Lynette C, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
"533 Northern, and no one has ever said that the tickets they bought were cheaper than from the airline. Not one ever."
"Not so, Grahame. We've had comments of ""saved a few dollars"" and ""saved 20 pounds""!"
I can easily envisage that sometimes it's possible to save a small amount as crappy third parties will just make the money back in the fees they charge which normally most people have no idea about until they have to pay up.The apparent savings on the advertised fare are one thing; the overall cost is quite another. But most of the time I think that the apparent savings even on the flight ticket are illusory.
"I've had majorbissues with this scam of a company too, I have emailed travelgino and tip monster many many times both companies say my email address isnt the one I booked from even tho I have all my booking confirmations that THEY SENT on that email! I need to make changes to my flight which is due to to leave on 24th Aug and have been trying since mid March to contact these robbers.I have contacted KLM (airline I'm flying with) and they say the cant make changes because TG hold the authority on the booking. I would like to get a personal reply and not an auto response telling me to email which I have done and had zero response or the automated rubbish about no booking on my email address."
"You won't get a personal response from Travelgenio, so if I was you I'd forget all about that.I don't know anything about Tip Monster to be honest. Who or what are they?"
"Sophia; We have over 20,000 complaints here about TG. We likely had over 15,000 when you made this booking.If you continue to buy things from online merchants without doing research first you will now and then lose your money (or it will take forever to get it back). This is one of those cases. You gave your money to a random stranger who made nice sounding promises to you, but they are unable to keep those promises. This was highly predictable."
"Hi Sophia K. Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps. Best regards."
