When looking for hotels in Venice on the hotel site many of the hotels are booked or if they have a room have a rate listed 3 times more expensive than a rate listed on a travel web site such as tri advisor/ travilocity/ hotels.com- ect. Do you think it is safe to book on one of the travel sites when the price is substantially lower or should I book only directly with the hotel?
- And of course booking on trip advisor would be my top choice if I do not book directly with hotel :)
"You can't book with Tripadvisor, they just list booking sites for the Hotels,we find www.venere.com as good as any,"
Do you think it's safer to book directly with hotel? Wondering why rooms are available when hotel shows no vacancy or very high prices?
"I always book directly with the hotel and did not notice better rates with consolidators. If you find better rates, you may bring this up with the hotel and see whether they would meet the rate. I just think that if I book through a consolidator where a hotel has to pay a commission, I will be given a room with a view of trash cans :)"
"Since when using an intermediary portal, the hotel must also pay a commission, it seems highly unusual, unless it is not the same category of room which could explain the price difference."
"Also, take a look at what is included. It is possible that tax/VAT is not included when booking through a consolidator, which may explain a lower price."
"hi: i booked a double room directly with a B&B and then later was browsing booking.com with the same place and found a double room for substantially cheaper...and said to myself, ""Hmmmm""....so i wrote to the hotel and asked if they could offer me the same price and they explained that what I had booked with them was a much nicer room (they were right and the pictures were different) and the one online was the 'basic' double. They could switch my booking to the basic room if i wanted for the less expensive price....they also let me know that because i was booking so far ahead (a year), the nicer room was being given to me at a substantial discount and told me the price difference....i opted to stay with my original booking for the 3 nights."
"I always book directly with the hotel, emailing them with all the precise details of my stay, mentioning the cheapest on-line price I've seen (whether from their own website or a third party), and asking for a quotation.At worst you'll get the rates offered on the hotel's website but often they'll find a way to discount or offer an upgrade (breakfast included, pay-in-advance or cash discount, etc.) In my personal experience -- and I understand this is not universal -- I find that once you arrive at the hotel, it's much easier to check in early, switch or upgrade rooms, or ammend the reservation if you've booked directly with the hotel rather than via a third party. I have seen hotel staff say to travelling companions ""your booking isn't with the hotel it's with xxxxx.com so you should call them, instead."""
Read this:https://www.mainstreet.com/article/an-epidemâ€¦So booking direct or with a reputable travel agent (not an online travel agent).
"We have booked direct also with the notable on line booking agencies , really not found we have been given inferior rooms,"
"I do my research on hotels.com or expedia for ease of comparison and viewing multiple hotel options. Once I find one(s) I like I go directly to the hotel website. 9 times out of 10 I find the hotel is offering the same room for the same price. If not I just book with the site - I've only ever made actual bookings with hotels.com. I've booked several times with hotels.com without any issue - when I've booked fully refundable rooms with them I have ended up cancelling a few times as something better/cheaper came up - refunds process has always been quick with no problems.I've received complimentary upgrades when checking in via a 3rd party reservation and having booked directly, so I wouldn't even say something like upgrades are negatively impacted by not booking direct."
Thank you so much for your advice!
