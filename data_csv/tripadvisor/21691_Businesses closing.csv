"I notice on their web-site that Senior Frogs on the Strip has decided that it will not be opening at all this year. Are there many other Albufeira Bars, Cafes, Restaurants that have also decided to do the same ? We are considering whether or not it is worth putting ourselves through a two week quarantine if restrictions are not lifted by September 8th . Obviously if the resort is almost empty or half of it closed , then that may influence our decision ."
"I have noticed that three of the 'tourist' bars at the marina have not so far opened with no sign that they intend to. All the rest are open. Of course, the 'nightlife' and 'entertainment' bars are not permitted to open.In the old town area I reckon 90% of restaurants and café / bars are open although some are keeping shorter hours eg not opening at lunchtime. Up here in Páteo, two of the places that have hitherto been closed have opened up again within the last week.There are plenty of people here from countries other than UK and only of few Brits of course. Overall business is obviously down n this time last year.Here's a picture of the town beach on Sunday. You can perhaps judge for yourself.https://i.postimg.cc/NFPFQc6p/DSC08967.jpg"
"Although Albufeiras nightlife will have been affected more than others the same restrictions that are behind the closures mentioned apply across the Algarve.A holiday abroad this year will for some be very different to past years.Fewer activities, closed bars and clubs, earlier closing times.That is not to say that you cannot have an enjoyable time just a different experience. .Probably more nightlife now exists where ever you come from in the UK."
Wouldn’t the fact that the virus is on the rise again influence your decision never mind the quarantine?
"The only thing that will put people off going on holiday is a complete lockdown.Insurance issues, wearing masks little or no nightlife will influence some but not a significant minority..A second or even third wave will have little effect."
Maybe when hospital beds start getting full again that will have an effect.
"William B - how is your comment relevant to the question? All the while people can make their own decisions they will. We do it all the time. There is risk in everything.Wait for UK governments to prohibit overseas travel completely. That would surely help keep you safer.The numbers here in Portugal are still tiny. About 0.5% of the population have been confirmed as infected since it began. Of those around 97% recovered completely. Not much worse than the annual 'flu epidemic, for which there is a vaccine."
Scaremongering doesnt help nor does being locked up all your life in your little bedroom . Grow some balls
"Speak for yourself #7, my bedrooms are huge.Cubsur, other comments are not relevant but thanks for highlighting mine."
Cubsur you also keep drawing a comparison between COVID and the annual flu which has no relevance at all.
"Well weighing all up I will still come end of August should FCO advice change, meaning insurance is valid. I can asses the risks and on the basis that we will stay in a private villa, have large initial shop delivered, make occasional but limited other visits to local small supermarket, otherwise spending daytimes around our own pool, eat out maybe 10 of 15 nights whilst following correct procedures re social distancing, hand cleaning/sanitising and mask wearing and on that basis feel that the risk is very low (the highest element being time in airport and on plane). William, you clearly have your concerns, fair enough, you have done your own risk assessment, but please let others make their decisions as they see fit. As long as they are complying with regulations then it is entirely down to the individual. Cubser, I would agree with William though on the point re COVID vs seasonal flu. Not saying seasonal flu is not a serious and often deadly disease, but COVID offer a new and additional threat, is far more deadly and has caused thousands and thousands of extra deaths so far this year compared to 10 year averages. We all have to be careful but being careful and having a holiday abroad are not mutually exclusive."
sr frogs opp the chemist on the strip defo open last sunday night and think the lower one open too but not 100% sure. I drove around the whole area for about 20 mins around 20:45 and it was depressing. Most places open and only 3 that I could see had more than a dozen clients. Most had 2-6 and the streets were full of masked up workers chatting with very few obvious tourists wandering around. Maybe the bars filled up later in the evening......
"Snr. Frog's Oura has a CV-19 closed banner on his TA_ page, which could only be done through 'his' management centre. It states he's closed till 30/12 If he is open, someone needs to remind him to remove it, I'm sure it's difficult enough getting punters in at the moment."
Lemmings -> cliffs.....
"As I said, why not let everyone decide for themselves instead of posting dopey comments like that!"
Temper....
#9 Annual deaths from flu 650k worldwide with a vaccine. Deaths from covid19 670k worldwide (to date) no vaccine available.
If countries hadn’t been on a lockdown it would be in the millions !
"Keirkitt in reply 16 makes the point I have been making all along. The numbers just don't stack up. What is it we are not being told about COVID-19 that makes it so dangerous? There must be something to have caused this massive reaction from governments world wide.The economic effects are now being realised. Many holiday related businesses in Albufeira and elsewhere will possibly never re-open for lack of money and ultimately lack of customers. Overseas sunshine holidays are no longer feasible for many.I passed through Lisbon airport earlier today. Talk about businesses closing! Row upon row of aircraft (mainly TAP) parked nose to tail all over the airport, many shops etc around the airport closed, although not in the tax free area you have to wind through to get to the departure area. Few checkin counters open. My flight out to France was about 3/4 full.I shall be glad of the change of scenery and also Albufeira is too hot for me!Edited: 1:37 pm, July 31, 2020 "

"Cubsur you seem to have a very short memory . Do you not remember that before lockdown various countries had approaching a 1000 people a day dying of multi organ failure because that is what Covid does to you , terrible scenes from hospitals across Europe and the rest of the world ."
No further comment from me on this issue.
"Just an update re Senhor Frogs ( up the side of Mambos Bar), I have had a message from someone who works for them and it's confirmed they will not be opening this year."
"the economic effects are now being realised?and this is just the beginning.i can even tell you roughly where it is going and how it will end unless the masses wake up and grow a backbone but people need to make the own mind up,they also need to get rid of fear otherwise they will never think clearly and I see a lot of fear in people that doesn't wash with me or many,many others.yes there is a new strain of the coronavirus and if you are getting on in life and have a poor immunity system and underlying health problems then it can be lethal just like the flu from last year and the year before and the year before,take away what the press,main stream media and obviously lying politicians who are really insulting our intelligence have rammed down our throats and would there be any difference from this time last year?I turned off from the main stream news the first week of lockdown because it was obvious to me they were trying to put fear in people for a reason!! so I went down the alternative news route which there is still plenty of them despite the obvious shadow banning by the broken facebook,youtube and twitter,hell even the president of the united states tweeted a video of a dozen or so doctors on capital hill last week giving their expert opinion deleted because they(our enemies) don't want you knowing the truth.other than building up your immune system and washing your hands I could debunk everything from the many,many doctors who have been pressured in to putting covid19 on death certificates when they clearly haven't died from covid19,to the PCR test which when you do your homework is clearly invalid making it very easy to manipulate the numbers,if you don't believe me look up a alternative news channel who all say the say thing whereas our goverments change there minds on a daily basis or read up on the guy who invented it in the 1980's who clearly wrote you can not use the PCR test for covid19.by the way nobody has come up with a gold standard test yet(isolate and purify)which beggers the question how can they be looking for a vaccine!!!as for masks my brother is a carer and I've been wearing a mask on and off in my line of work for 40 years and I would sooner go to prison than wear a mask instructed by our so called elected leaders who are supposed to be serving us but it now seems the other way round.at the end of the day people make their own mind up and if they want to take a vaccine then please do your home work on the record of bill gates vaccines and de-population speeches."
Was it good? Sorry I missed it. Sometimes you can almost visualize the saliva sprayed on the screen.
Quite a long piece about refusing a vaccine and 'I would go to prison rather than wear a mask'. Blah blah
