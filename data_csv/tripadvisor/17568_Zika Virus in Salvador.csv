I am not pregnant or at risk for getting pregnant but it still seems like all the Zika virus news makes going there seem unpleasant. Has anyone been recently who could discuss the impact of Zika and mosquitos in general?
"Salvador is trying to deal with the Zika virus:http://bit.ly/1KfWrQVThe Brazilian government is preparing to launch a “mega-operation” to eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites and to educate the public about its role in combating the spread of disease.In a nationally televised broadcast, President Dilma Rousseff announced the mobilization of 220,000 soldiers to accompany the country’s 300,000 health workers on house-to-house visits.http://bit.ly/1O4Nnc4Zika Virus: Questions and Answers:http://syndication.nih.gov/zika.htm"
"Brazil reports an explosion of dengue, a bad omen for spread of Zika virus. If mosquitoes are spreading dengue, they could be spreading more cases of Zika and chikungunya as well, doctors warn.http://wapo.st/1KgfVow"
"I am living in Salvador since many years.My partner had zika in november, she felt unconfortable (mainly headaches) for some daysI never had it, but having a strong imune system is proven to help and prevent zika, dengue and .. the fluI would simply compare it to having the fluallthough there is no scientific proof (yet) that zika leds to micro encefalia for babies I would not advise pregnant women to comeif you have a good physical condition then just arrange for adequate repellent and you'll be ok"
"UPDATEit is getting more and more UNlikely that zika has anything to do with microcephaly ...but instead a pestice the Brazilian government made add to the public waternet in order to control mosquito problems, We are talking about PYRIPROXYFEN as a much more reasonable cause of the microcephaly.More and more doubts rise about the reasonability of this pesticide :sott.net/article/312010-Zika-virus-or-insect…https:/…theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2987137/…Of course, the Brazilian Government denies the above in official statements BUT suspended (or at least pretends it did) the use of pyriproxyfen :…globo.com/tempo/filtro/noticia/2016/02/gove…no smoke without a fire ;-)Edited: 4 years ago "
Rumors that tainted vaccines or contaminated water might be the cause of microcephaly in the country were quickly dismissed by WHO and Brazil’s Ministry of Health.http://bit.ly/1PYMzeA
"More than 35 million citizens of Brazil live without drinking water and one hundred million have no sewage system. The lack of basic sanitation is one of the factors which has led to the proliferation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits the Zika virus, dengue and chikungunya fever. http://bit.ly/1U7S0JR"
Research indicates another common mosquito may be able to carry Zika:http://reut.rs/1TbF9XQ
