"Most of those people are delivery people. I see them hanging out together on the street. I wouldn't order delivery because those people are likely to bring the virus to you with your food. They spend their down time in groups chatting, they are making deliveries to and interacting with god knows how many people, and go all over the place etc. They seem highly likely to get infected."
"People just don't get it sometimes. As the stories of the new virus was starting, I sat down with a friend who told me about 5 minutes into our conversation at a concert, ""Oh, I think I'm coming down with a cold."" Luckily I didn't get anything. Then there was the story of a woman who walked into the local Spectrum (cable, tv, phone) office late last week who was wearing a hospital bracelet. When she was questioned by the clerk she said that she had just come from the hospital for treatment for the coronavirus. They immediately shut down the office & disinfected everything but what was she thinking?"
"""They immediately shut down the office & disinfected everything but what was she thinking?"" she was simply thinking about herself and nobody else. A lot of people are selfish. There is real concern that the president is considering pulling back on the social distancing against the advice of the medical community. If he does that it is game over. Guess we need a famous NBA player or someone to drop dead over this for it to be taken more seriously by the public."
"The rest of us order from restaurants and drive or walk over to the restaurant to pick it up at the front door. This seems safest to me. My Brother-in-law lives in Times Square, so he, his missus, and the dog are about the only one who walk around there nowadays. And he picks things up at the restaurant door, and leaves a 20% tip for the staff."
"People in the UK are ignoring advice to self-isolate or keep contact to an absolute minimum. News reports show all of our beach resorts and coastal walks/promenades absolutely mobbed yesterday. Parks were the same and hillwalking, mountaineering resorts were the same. These stupid people are just not getting it.Boris is making a statement at 8.30pm tonight (20 minutes from now) and I fear it will be to advise of total lockdown due to ignorance/disbelief of the advice given non-stop so far."
@5 my understanding is that the UK was letting the virus spread under the theory that people would build up immunity and they could keep it to a level that it wouldn't overwhelm the medical system. Now they are seeing that its not something they can keep in check and are trying to backtrack.
No red259 this is absolutely not the case and I can’t imagine how or where you got that idea. I’m off to watch the PM address to the country now and will post afterwards.
"#7 - There were multiple reports (perhaps incorrect?) about a plan to at least partly rely on ""herd immunity"" https:/…"
"So, our PM Boris Johnson has just announced a lockdown for at least three weeks. This is largely due to people ignoring the advice to self-isolate, keep a safe distance, stay away from people/public places etc, etc, etc. I feel upset at the view the UK were allowing the virus to spread to build immunity. So not the case as to to laughable and embarrassing.It’s a bit of a nightmare to be honest and none of us know how we will deal with it. No choice really, but I forsee a lot of difficulties.Edited: 4:49 pm, March 23, 2020 "
@7 Just some examples. It absolutely was the case. https:/…https:/…https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…
In the UK there WAS talk of letting the virus spread. This was in the early days. The idea was knocked on the head because this strategy works when there is a vaccine. There's NO vaccine.
"As I said, I feel upset at the view the UK were not taking this seriously. The vast majority of us absolutely were/are.Possibly BJ’s delivery of the handling of the crisis was/is different from your leader’s way, but please be assured that the vast majority of us have not seen it the way your links above suggest."

"I don't think anyone is saying nobody in the UK was taking it seriously, only that the government was taking a huge risk in its policy of herd immunity.At least they had a policy, here in the states it'd very much a ""whatever each state wants to do,"" which is worse, since the ones not taking it seriously are just a 90 minute flight to the ones that are."
"""At least they had a policy, here in the states it'd very much a ""whatever each state wants to do,"" which is worse, since the ones not taking it seriously are just a 90 minute flight to the ones that are."" Yes the US is a disaster at this point because the country is doing everything half-assed with some states doing tons and others just screwing around and a federal government that isn't stepping up fully."
I read an article today that whether people take the virus seriously depends in large measure on their politics. Rejection of science and medicine cannot have a good end.
"""I read an article today that whether people take the virus seriously depends in large measure on their politics"" Honestly purely from the politicians I can't tell if next week everything will go back to normal or if we will all be dead. Of course, if you look at the science and listen to the actual medical community the answer is pretty damn clear."
"""Yes the US is a disaster at this point because the country is doing everything half-assed with some states doing tons and others just screwing around and a federal government that isn't stepping up fully.""That's why the governor's strategy of working with CT, NJ, and PA makes so much sense.

"I share your frustration. I have been out of my apartment building 4 times, briefly, in the last 2 weeks. The only way it slows down is if everyone stays inside for a few weeks.My friend's father has been in a medically induced coma and respirator with this for a few days now, and they're starting experimental treatments on him.

"I said isn't stepping up FULLY. We have governors bidding against eachother on medical supplies because the national production act isn't being used. We have states all doing their own things often with little to no guidance from the federal government.

"The 'herd immunity' theory WAS the original thinking, but was quickly dropped."
Back to restaurants: the good actors in this business are trying to make sure there’s funding to get back in business. https:/…fn99tfQssW
The Javits Center is probably one of the most suitable places for a conversion to a medical facility because of the many electrical outlets provided normally to exhibitors. Big spaces without these are less practical.

"Staying current:No shock that Liquor stores are making a killing in this environment.And Barneys will be come Eataly. That will be interesting....And one of my favorite restaurants has become a fish market, for now...https://ny.eater.com/2020/3/24/21191721/nyc-…"
"""Bumbling Boris "" I watched a whole segment about him. I don't think he is a bumbling guy. I think he is putting on an act and he knows exactly what he is doing. I don't follow him too closely though so I could be wrong but I think Boris is sharper than he lets on."
"""No shock that Liquor stores are making a killing in this environment."" yes no shock at all. I may pick up some wine at some point. Its just that I have to walk several blocks to get to the place I like and that is a lot of social distancing I would have to do. Is there someone who delivers wine?"
"In Quebec, for the next 3 weeks, only essential stores are staying opened. Which means food (humans and animals), pharmacies, marijuana stores and liquor stores. Oh yes, also Walmart as they have a food section. All these are considered essentials."
"red: Is there someone who delivers wine?EVERY Liquor store delivers. I got an email from Garnet that they are now only delivering cases right now. But I have ordered from so many different liquor stores, depending what I'm looking for, and have never been denied. I bet your local liquor store will deliver if you call. They may have imposed a minimum."
"Hmm I guess that makes sense. I don't buy alcohol that often maybe once every six weeks or so and like to go and look around the store before picking out what I want, although I do have some wines I am partial to so I could certainly call up and place a specific order. How much would I typically save by buying a case vs buying individual bottles? I don't normally buy in bulk (don't drink it super fast and limited storage area) but if its going to be a few months then maybe it would be worth looking into."
"Depending on the store, 10-20% off of a case. Most stores will do a mixed case without an issue."
"Re “not just the hamptons” ... can we just acknowledge that such a phrase is a gross mischaracterization of an entire community? Are there arrogant mega rich? Yes. But there are also plenty of regular people. Generous people. Hard working people. Local people. My husband grew up here in the 60s and 70s and we got our own house here 10 years ago. I’m tired of hearing the bs about our community. The place runs on local businesses. They’re hurting. They depend on the summer season and do you really think people will be going to the Hamptons this summer to be going out? And please, forget the puff pieces about all the mega million homes. They are just one part of a very diverse area. Did you know 1/3 of East Hampton is Hispanic? Probably not because that doesn’t get the headlines. That it’s a Sanctuary City? Probably not. And forget the designer stores. They’re just billboards for high end international brands."
"The hamptons have a lot of lower income people that live there year round. The rich just come in during the summer. I grew up in a summer town on the shore. The town's population would quadruple during the summertime, but only a small group of us were true locals.Edited: 11:42 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"Huntley, I fully agree with you and have quite a number of friends among the local community in each of the towns. The comment was in reference to another post that contained a quite heinous article about the homeowners who have left the city and gone out east. I think it was in the NYPost, but it was the subject of a lot of comment in this forumThere is nothing wrong w people who own homes to choose to spend time in them now. Others disagree, but if you own a home, pay taxes, etc, then it should be available for you as you choose. And I am quite familiar w the year round nature of the local communities (I’m both very friendly w a number of locals and have dated two or three for extended periods). Note: another one of these class warfare articles will be appearing in The NY Times soon. I was asked to give names of people i know who left to a reporter writing a story on people leaving the city but I declined. I gave them (w my friend’s consent) the name of someone who left for Canada instead."
There is the Shinnecock Nation lands next to Southampton and an African American community outside of Sag Harbor as well.
"Risa - I read that post piece. I’m glad to know you didn’t take it seriously!As the Dr (not Fauci, the other dr who’s name escapes me at the moment) said behind the podium, people leaving nyc (like we did) for their houses on Long Island (like we did) need to self quarantine for 14 days (which we’ve been doing for 18 days, so far.)Yesterday the Town of East Hampton issued the same recommendation. We already have many cases here. And just a small hospital. So we are staying home 24/7 for however long it takes until this horrible crisis passes. We’re also very grateful to the usps guy, the fed ex guy, and the ups guy, who have been literal lifelines as we order online to stock the pantry & the freezer. If other people are in the same boat, please give these people a tip. Whatever you can afford. If you go out and shop, please consider doing the same in grocery & drug stores. And if there are small businesses you rely on generally but can’t support now either because they’re closed or for any other reason, most places have set up go fund me campaigns for their employees. Give as generously as you can."
"Yes. My friends out there and in Manhattan are all tipping very very generously for the services. I plan on Venmo’ing my hairdresser some cash (as soon as I find out whether I’m getting paid or not. Unclear right now and, well, quite scary). I spoke with one of my restaurant owner friends he has had no trouble getting fresh supplies in sag harbor. And I hear Bobby vans has converted to a meat purveyor in Bridgehampton and packing up for home cooking.I never take those articles seriously. One or two bad actors is not indicative of a whole community.Edited: 10:56 am, March 25, 2020 "
"I guess some situations bring the best in people and others the worse.There was an older lady at a grocery store a few days ago, someone screamed at her for being there as it was dangerous for her. The message was right but the delivery of said message was all wrong. The lady was there because she had no one to help and started crying. Fortunately, someone came to her rescue, gave her phone number and offered to do errands for the older lady."
"Risa - yes, restaurants and other take out food businesses are really stepping up out here with curbside and/or delivery. And I’m sure we will occasionally take them up on it! But it’s not financially sustainable for many people to eat this way regularly, and it’s not our thing in any case. My husband spent 3.5 hrs going from store to store looking for things when we first got here. He was extremely frustrated.  And that was before the shelves at some groceries went empty. I don’t actually know how the stores out here are this week. But with more and niece NYC residents landing here all thev time ...mThe good news for us is that I love to cook. But the time suck has been finding the right online sources for various things. MI’m dealing w a resp virus (not covid) that I picked up in India 8 weeks ago (!) so I’m compromised. I’m also 63. So it’s not smart for either my husband or I to shop around town. Ive recently started a daily Instagram of what I make for dinner every night. @CiaoBellaFina (my jewelry line account.). Sadly I left almost all my jewelry materials and all my finished product in NYC because we didn’t have room in the car for it & thought at that time that my husband would be back in a few days to load up that and other overflow. That turned out to be a bad idea. So I’m expressing myself in the kitchen instead. It’s been very rewarding. I’m trying new things based on what I have in the pantry & the freezer. So far so good lol. Tonight’s dinner is home made 7 grain bread, fish I got from Alaska sautéed with lemon & capers, and a simple stir fry vegetable from a bag of same from Trader Joe’s that I brought from our nyc freezer. To all my friends as well as people I don’t know who are still in NYC, we think about you constantly. We love our city. And we’re grateful to every single person on the front lines, and to gov Cuomo, who is doing a fantastic job, demonstrating competence, straight talk & empathy every single day."
"You're doing the right thing. I understand why people are leaving. While I have friends in Manhattan who insist that they are fine going on long ""socially distant"" walks, it makes me nervous. Between elevators and door handles, etc etc, there are too many land mines to risk going outside. At least out there, you have a little space to be outside. A friend of mine in DC is experiencing chills, usually the first sign of ""it."" She has a dog and has been doing long dog walks, and probably got exposed that way. It's very scary. I'm staying inside. Thankful for my yoga mat and Deepak Chopra meditations."
"A couple of points regarding the UK and ‘herd immunity’.Firstly there is no vaccine and there’s no prospect of one soon. There may never be a vaccine - there are other viral illnesses that have no vaccine (the common cold for instance). Most viral illnesses are mitigated by ‘herd immunity’ to some extent.But the issue with Covid 19 is not only is it more infectious than (say) ‘flu, it’s also more deadly. The effect is that with a highly infectious deadly disease healthcare systems get overwhelmed quickly and when that happens people who would ordinarily recover can’t get treatment and die. These need not be Covid 19 sufferers but anyone who needs a high dependency hospital bed or the staff with the skills.The UK number crunchers reckoned more than 500,000 additional deaths (more than WW2, more than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined) within a few months. So it became obvious the only viable tactic was to slow the spread and reduce the peak demand on hospital beds.It may be the total numbers infected will be unchanged, but by reducing the peak the availability of the healthcare system to respond is improved and the death count reduced. After a while (months hopefully) sufficient people will have been infected and have developed immunity so although the disease may rumble on the hospitals will be able to cope. Maybe a vaccine will turn up but the strategy doesn’t rely on it.And yes Boris appears as a bit bumbling and on the edge of losing control - it’s an act! Nicola Sturgeons act is very different, but successful politicians all have a style that works for them."
"IMO it's not necessarily the act of going to an alternate location.It's whether you do so responsibly.Arriving and behaving like locusts when the local stores (esp. in a location in with a ""season"") when they would not have anticipated increased demand and been able to increase stocks is inappropriate.Knowingly traveling with test results pending/confirmed and/or symptoms of active disease and then showing up at a smaller hospital is even more wrongEdited: 2:01 pm, March 25, 2020 "
Exercise indoors if you live in an apartment: You have a :built-in Stairmaster.

"Huntley, the NYTimes piece came out. It is just as obnoxious, although arguably better written. I am not promoting it by linking, but you can easily find it."
"#53 Apartment buildings constructed after Sept. 1, 1951, have enclosed stairwells that are not well ventilated. Persons huffing and puffing are going to contaminate the air rather quickly should they be sick. In my building, there is a foot square louver at the top with the doors to the stairwell being raised an inch or so to admit air."
"I walk up/down stairs in my building once in a while. They're very dusty, so breathing isn't great. I suppose I could go out and walk up and down the steps at Federal Hall, but I'm trying to stay in to social distance. (elevator buttons, elevators, doors, they're all one big petri dish).

"Just a shout-out to my fellow New Yorkers. Hope everyone is hanging in there. Big big big shout-out to medical professionals, EMS, Police, Fire, and everyone who is considered essential personnel. I have been holed up in my studio apartment, the one that I got thinking “Well, it’s tiny but I won’t be spending much time here.” I have been doing fine, thank God. I got supplies a few weeks ago and have limited going out to absolute essential trips. Last week I had to go in to work and, not wanting to take the subway, I rented a Citibike. I sanitized it of course, had gloves on, my own helmet. If. You are in the city and able to do this, I highly highly recommend renting one of these bikes and enjoying the relative lack of traffic. It was surreal pedaling through Herald Square and Times Square and crossing over those wide avenues with only random cars and buses to dodge. If you are stressed out or getting cabin fever, I highly recommend. Just be sure to disinfect the bike and take care while renting it, using the touch pads with a tissue, gloves or wiping everything with disinfectant."

My husband grew up in a small village by the ocean with dirt roads, local fishermen and small houses. In the past fifteen years, that village has become a mecca for people with more money than taste. They buy, tear down the houses and build McMansions. No lobstermen live there any more and most houses are owned by people ""from away."" His mother has managed to hang on.

I didn't see anything in DTs tweet that said that they are coming to NYC. The US shouldn't pay for their security IMO.I do agree that DT doesn't need to be tweeting this but it is the same old same old and I am amazed that people still comment on these types of tweets. He is not going to change so people should put their focus elsewhere also and ignore stupid tweets like this.
"I don't see it as appropriate to judge them. Her family is in California. Their agents and staff for some of their organizations are in Los Angeles.

"#144. There was a similar problem with the Hasidic community here (primarily in the Borough Park & Williamsburg areas of Brooklyn). Long after gatherings of more than a min number of people had been banned here, they continued to have large weddings in Brooklyn. In one case neighbors called the police, who arrived and asked them to disperse, at which point the revelers went outside and started to dance in the street (the neighbors filmed this). This was a couple of weeks ago. Borough Park and Williamsburg are now two of the hardest hit areas of the city, in the ""red zone."""

"You have your opinion and I have mine, someone who wants to watch wrestling will have theirs. #289, how is someone ""spreading the virus"" by going to their second home? You're assuming that they have the virus. Plus if they go shopping with a mask on and follow the social distancing guidelines, then what's the issue? People have a right to go to their homes, first home, second home, whatever."
"Re 292 and 293: I think there is a lot of confusion about what is and is not dangerous behavior. While it's true you can't assume someone is spreading the virus unless they have been tested, some (like the PM of New Zealand) take the approach, for now, to stamp out virus (which is what they are trying to do there) we all need to assume we are carriers, no matter how good we feel -- therefore, stay inside, wash hands/sanitize both BEFORE and after going out, etc. (And even if you HAVE been tested, just because you were negative last week doesn't mean you're negative this week).The thing about second and third homeowners retreating to their country properties is it is perceived by locals as possibly straining local services (not to mention importing plague from the big bad city) -- whether small community hospitals or local supermarkets and gas stations. Of course, it is true that the second and third homeowners are also taxpayers and have a right to be there. However, those taxes would likely be higher for everyone if local government needed to assume services were going to be provided year round to a larger population. The hospitals, regardless of who funds them, would likely be operated and staffed differently if they knew they would be serving a larger population. Many small community hospitals in resort areas bring in temporary docs and nurses during normal ""high"" seasons, have more calls by specialists from regional medical centers in ""high"" season, etc. So having a whole bunch of people suddenly move in during the off season can at least temporarily strain services. It's nothing that can't be fixed by having supermarket and gas stations order more, or a tax hike next year, or scrambling for more hospital help now, but in the meantime it can be unpleasant for the folks already there.Some people are really getting carried away by something about which they knew practically nothing a month ago. Yesterday some woman on my neighborhood site was mouthing off about how disgusting it was for people to be walking around outside without masks. Well even Dr. Fauci doesn't wear a mask outside if he knows he's going to be 6 feet from people, like when he's running or power walking with his wife, and has said he thinks that's what other people should do too. -- basically no need for a mask outdoors, which I assume is why none of the children I see playing in my park wear masks.Edited: 5:42 pm, April 14, 2020 "
"""- basically no need for a mask outdoors, which I assume is why none of the children I see playing in my park wear masks."" Masks are recommended for outdoors. In many parts of NYC its pretty much impossible to keep six feet of social distancing at all times including outside. The point of the mask is so people who may be infected but don't know it do not pass it on to others. Fauci is not power walking through the streets of NYC. If children aren't wearing masks that is because of their parents and the way I see the young parents acting lately I wouldn't make any decisions based on their actions. For people running in a park I don't think a mask is feasible with running, but they also tend to be spread out and if passing people do it very quickly.Edited: 6:16 pm, April 14, 2020 "
"""Some people are really getting carried away by something about which they knew practically nothing a month ago.""Totally agree."
"And as I understand the most recent research, people who are running often propel their fumes much more than 6 feet -- more like 15 or 20 -- so I steer a VERY wide berth when I encounter them, esp since none of them wear masks and they frequently run on sidewalks. Otherwise, I am not particularly concerned, as I don't have much trouble staying 6 feet away from people."
"Also, regarding #295, can we have a cite on who specifically is recommending masks for the outdoors? Like what govt official or agency?"
The street in NYC is clearly a public place where it is difficult for most people to maintain six feet of distance.https:/…cloth-face-cover.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/well/move…
Have you been on a NYC street recently? I live in midtown Manhattan and generally have no problem staying 6 feet away from people. My only issue is the groups of homeless people now congregating on some corners that I sometimes have to walk through to get to my destination and the little kids racing around on scooters and bikes.
"""Have you been on a NYC street recently?"" yes frequently and I have never been able to completely avoid people since I live in an extremely dense residential neighborhood. I have a couple of friends that live in midtown and there is a lot of commercial space in their neighborhoods so with those people not coming into work that diminishes the number of people in their area. I wish I could just walk around without having to pass a dozen of people within a five minute period. The homeless drive me nuts because they camp out in front of doors to restaurants/stores and you are forced to come within six feet of them to enter/exit the premises. There should be a stop put to that. I don't have patience for the kids on scooters/bikes zipping around if they are coming within six feet of me. That is clearly poor parenting, especially since we know children can be asymptomatic and spread this."

Not only are real people employed by these places (The Met has over 1000 employees who are now furloughed) these places generate income for other places as well as someone who comes to NY for the Opera, will eat at a restaurant and stay at a hotel and do other things to spend money and help the economy"

"""We should be happy with what the federal government has done and is doing. No one is perfect, but look beyond the politics.""It doesn't really matter what Trump does, does it? Doesn't matter how many Americans die due to his incompetence does it? No matter what trump does you seem like you will defend him and try to shame others for calling out his conduct. Nobody is saying he has to be perfect, but he refuses to ever acknowledge any of his mistakes and lies and tries to pass the blame to others as he continues to make mistakes. Its reprehensible that you think the way he has conducted himself warrants a defense. To say we should be happy with 614,451 confirmed cases and close to 30k deaths and that we still don't have the necessary testing is just appalling. 752 people have died in the last 24 hours. I don't understand how anybody can claim to be happy with the federal response, except if they believe whatever lie Trump utters. I mean he lies every single press conference. I know you will claim fake news, but that just shows how deluded you are. All people have to do is go to his twitter feed and compare what he is saying now to what he said back then or look at past public statements by him and compare it to what he says now. There is nothing to be happy about with a president who seems completely incapable of being honest especially in a time of crisis."

"That is correct, Andy. You can use any scarf or bandana, it doesn't have to be an N95 surgical grade mask.

@344 yea I thought of that but I don't have any of those laying around. I could use a scarf but its going to be too hot. I have some face masks but they aren't going to last forever. Not sure which stores are more likely to have them as most of the stuff nearby is pharmacies and they are always sold out. I guess I could look for some hardware stores to see if they are still open.

Maybe we should be grateful that he hasn't treated us the way he treated Puerto Rico after Maria; he threw paper towels into a crowd and laughed. We should be grateful that he's not mocked us yet, but he's not done, as you say,""the best is yet to come"".The title of the topic is Bad Behavior, and in this case it looks like the worst behavior has started at the top, but filters down to his trolling Washington Examiner reading minions."

A lot of Monday morning quarterbacks here, but I'd like to know what you would have done if you were in the hot seat. Not surprising, we live in a heavily democratic area, those that are deep blue hate the current administration and even when good is done, they pick it apart. All of the left wing publications want to put down the President and the administration any chance they can. The tolerant left only sees things one way. If you post a right wing source, they denounce it. Well, it is what it is. If you're a liberal, keep believing everything the left wing publications are putting out. Puerto Rico, didn't they find all kinds of supplies in warehouses at some point? Wasn't Cuomo crying and crying over ventilators, saying he needed so many more than what he did? If you think Cuomo isn't playing politics, then look again. The Javits and the Comfort, were those ever filled to capacity?"
"""The best is yet to come"" was said by President Trump at every one of his 2020 rallies prior to the pandemic. OAN carried all of his rallies without interruption.

Some people will lose family or friends. Some people will lose their businesses and be unable to recover. Some people will walk out unscathed. We are not all in this together.

"The worst one I know is a friend who died and his wife could not go to the funeral because she was in quarntine and because she was at high risk, she also caught it and has been in the hospital on oxygen for 2 almost 2 weeks.This really isnt disucssed here as people think of NYC as a big anonymoyus city, but that not always the case, there are parts in the outer boroughs where there is a small town mentality and everyone sort of knows everyone or knows someone who knows that person . Like a 1 degree of seperation so its really bad here as everyone has been hit"
"420 - Howard, anyone who lives here long enough knows NYC is a series of overlapping villages. You may not know all the names of the people on the stoops, the shopkeepers or the people you see regularly commute on the same times but your begin to recognize each other and they become your village.i may have noticed it as I moved here as an adult - natives may take it for granted or not know it happens less elsewhere in car culture.One of the best pieces of advice I ever received, when I moved here in the bad old eighties, was to patronize and become familiar with the shopkeepers that stayed open late along my walk home from the subway so they'd know I was a part of the neighborhood and shelter me if I needed to call the police"

If you know where they are going I would report the religious leader. The few (because most religious leaders are not doing this) religious leaders who are conducting these in person services are the problem. No reason why people should be allowed to go risk being infected and then bring it back and risk your health or that of others in the neighborhood.

We are in a precarious time with risk, economic insecurity and far less density on the streets. That's what happens. Be prudent, be careful, be wise, be safe. This too shall pass."
"The article posted in 433 is disturbing because of the heightened risk of currently quieter streetsIt's also a big problem because kids who were supposed to be under some sort of supervision, even in normal times, should not be out especially when one is a known criminal.The good thing is that bystanders still intervened"
"@438 They should have a curfew on minors. The city council has discussed this before and its done in other large cities such as Los Angeles and chicago. It won't solve the problem completely by any means, but it could certainly have an impact. No reasons for unsupervised minors to be out on the streets on their own at night during the current situation."
The woman whose husband died of corona and who has been in the hosptial for 2 weeks was intubated. and sedated and put on a ventitator
I'm sorry to hear that Howard. How old is she?
early 50's
Oh wow that is somewhat young for this type of complication.
440 Howard - I'm so sorry to hear that.I know it's not much but we are thinking of you and your neighbors and hoping for the best
Her husband who died was also early 50's . Someone else i know who died was late 50's and a couple of others early 60's
When I go on here and say Queens is #1 I didnt mean it this way
Hang in there Howard. Someday this will nightmare will end.
"Howard, as you know, I've had a friend's father who has been on a vent for weeks now, he's 57, and still hanging in, in the hospital for a month already. Some days, there are good signs. Some days, I think NYU is keeping him alive to test out theories....I don't know. This virus is tricky, there doesn't seem to be a consensus or predictability which of the treatments work, although there is a new drug from Gilead Science that seems to be working better. Another friend of mine who was deathly ill and in the ICU for 2 weeks responded to an experimental drug that I can't remember the name of....so they are making progress. I hope your friend's doctors hit the magic combo and she comes out of it soon. But the vent allows her body to rest and maybe it will help her heal. Please keep us posted. We are all learning way too much about epidemiology. I preferred being completely ignorant."
"The NYPD have been very badly impacted by the virus so their ranks are depleted. Kids are out of school for at least another month. A single woman going out alone at night in NYC in any section of the city, pandemic or no pandemic, is a very bad idea. Ten years ago, my daughter and her then boyfriend were mugged in Brooklyn while attending an off campus art opening. They were jumped by a gang of kids in Halloween masks. Her boyfriend was beaten and had a seizure. My daughter had her hair ripped out and her cell phone stolen. Bad time.https:/…Prayers for our men and women in blue. And Howard, I'm very sorry for your losses. My good friend's Dad just died from Covid. We haven't reached peak yet in the NY metro area."
"While I grew up on Long Island , I have lived most of my adult life in NYC. I can tell you my neighborhood of Queens is very safe, As safe as Long Island. I know Queens and Nassau County very well (I grew up in Nassau and still work there) Single woman can walk perfectly safe here, they do all the time"
"I think it is very bad advice to tell single women it's safe to walk alone, at night, either in NYC, Queens or anywhere on Long Island. My best friend is a single woman in her 50's who lives in a single family home in Forest Hills (a very nice section of Queens). She has had several attempted break-ins ever since her dog died and has installed a security system. If for some reason a woman absolutely has to go out alone at night, she should carry bear spray with her. I believe mace was outlawed by the same folks who authorized the bail reform disaster."
452 - I'm under the impression the possession and use of defense sprays was legalized in NYS under limited circumstances - over Rudy's objections - in 1996. https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/nyregion/… Has it changed since then? Are the same politicians in office?Have you ever lived within the NYC city limits? How often do you come here?
"Here are a couple of links to clarify what I meant about mace being illegal. I suppose I should have clarified that animal pepper spray of a limited quantity is permitted. It would appear mace is also legal with extreme limitations regarding means of purchase. >> It is illegal to mail pepper spray from another city, state or country into New York.>>Meaning, if you live in NY, you cannot order pepper spray online and have it delivered to your residence. https://legalbeagle.com/6611469-pepper-spray…https:/…pepperspraycenter.com/newblog/…So if you want to carry pepper spray for self-defense in NY, you have to go to an authorized dealer and pass a background check."
"#453As a DE for Brooklyn, your response of ""Nonsense"" to the mother of a college student who was mugged while she was accompanied by her boyfriend at 7:00 PM (still light) in Brooklyn is .... I don't know what. Her boyfriend was taken by ambulance to the worst hospital in Brooklyn, rated F. She didn't have the pepper spray I had purchased for her with her because she had her boyfriend with her. I hope you never have to receive a phone call like I did.https:/…"
"What century and what planet do you live in, Lisa? While we are in a bad situation right now where caution is advisable, normally I go out all of the time alone. (Queens and Brooklyn are part of NYC). I walk all over Manhattan and take the subways alone, without fear or concern (but with awareness). There is no reason for not living a full life if one is single in the New York metropolitan area."
"#45721st Century, planet Earth."
"Pepper Spray is Legal, I bought it in a pharmacy. As a native Long Islander, I apologize for other people who claim to be from Long Island"
"#456You did say in #453 “...pandemic or no pandemic...”As a female tourist who has visited NYC on her own, I have felt very comfortable staying in LIC, midtown, and lower Manhattan, loved exploring Astoria (reminds me of where I grew up in Toronto), travelled on the subway to Little Italy in the Bronx, explored parts of Brooklyn, event went to the Ironbound area of Newark to visit the Portuguese area there, and felt safe.Of course coming from another diverse big city, and understanding that most people just want to be left alone to carry on with their own business, helped up my comfort level and avoid drawing negative attention. Sadly, sometimes people bring out the worst in others, maybe that’s why I feel compelled to speak up here; certainly my gut tells me that your college student and her boyfriend weren’t necessarily trying to blend in or be respectful of others. Sometimes bad things do happen to (good?) people for no reason, but sometimes they bring it on themselves. Just saying.Edited: 10:21 am, April 17, 2020 "
"This thread had turned a corner but unfortunately it never lasts long. As a frequent solo female visitor to NYC, I find it ridiculous to say that a female should never walk alone in the city. Of course, bad things can happen to anyone, anywhere, any time. There are some parts of the city where I wouldn't walk alone late at night, but I also have no reason to be in those areas. I regularly walk alone at midnight or one am, I take the subway at 1 am. I am always aware of my surroundings and I choose my path wisely, but rarely have I ever felt uncomfortable. I'm mostly in Manhattan at that time of night but on occasion have stayed in LIC and downtown Brooklyn. If I were in the city now with empty streets at night, it would likely be a different story.Back to the previous topic, my condolences to those who have lost friends and loved ones and best wishes for a full recovery to those ill."
"#461Your ""gut"" is wrong. They attended NYU and Columbia. They were in Brooklyn for an art opening of one of her classmates. My daughter even rented a loft in Williamsburg/Brooklyn for a year with 3 other students. They were robbed.Tourists coming to NYC or visiting any area in NY, need to keep their eyes open and as you say, not stick out like a sore thumb because they run a high risk of being targeted by pickpockets.I'll say it again - advising single women to walk alone at night in NY is unwise. It is also foolish and irresponsible. Those of you who feel confident to do so, bully for you. Rock on. Advice from a man, with all due respect, is irrelevant."
"Tourists with even minimal commonsense are not at a high risk of crime. Pickpocketing is not super common in NYC. I see women walking alone at night ALL the time. Under normal circumstances with basic commonsense NYC is safe.Edited: 12:00 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"However irrelevant a man's opinion may or may not be on whether a woman ought to walk alone at night in the big scary city, that of a suburbanites is even less so, by a lot. With all due respect of course.The women I know have no problem walking along at night. They do it all the time. They'd likely feel sorry for one so mousy and petrified that they couldn't walk around ANYWHERE in our city at night unaccompanied, specially since it's so commonplace. But keep everyone should keep their own counsel on it.Edited: 12:17 pm, April 17, 2020 "

Unreal. In a time of crisis this is the crap the country gets. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/liberate-d…
"Agree with Kaye in 470.For anyone genuinely concerned about actual safety under normal circumstances (that is, when tourists return):""I see women walking alone at night ALL the time. Under normal circumstances with basic commonsense NYC is safe.""I grew up not far from Manhattan, but moved here after college when I was 21. During the 80s, there were some rougher spots, like Amsterdam Ave in the high 80s-90s, which were a little dicey. I was pickpocketed on subways and buses during that period from time to time. Since then, the city is fine. I take the subway home late at night (2AM?) by myself with no concern. I walk home after 11 with no concern. My decision to take a taxi instead of the subway has to do with (a) if it's late and there will be a 20 minute wait for a subway and I just want to get home already or (b) I'm wearing very high heels and in a place that is more than a 10 minute walk to a subway and it's late and I'm tired. Otherwise, I have left black tie events at Cipriani after 11 or 12 at night and gotten right on the subway at 42nd next to the entrance. No concern whatsoever. No concern walking home from the subway. I can't speak for the safety of every spot in the 5 boroughs of NYC. But I have zero, absolutely ZERO concern about being a single woman in Manhattan alone at night moving around in any locale that would be likely for a reasonable tourist to be. That's 37 years of continuous living in Manhattan on the UWS (W 90s), UES (East 60ths) and in FiDi. And I've walked home from let's say, Pastis to FiDi, whenever the weather is good (and the shoes aren't stilettos, but just wedges). And that's why I love NYC.Edited: 2:27 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"Hear, hear to Risa and Kaye. I was also going to say my wallet was last lifted from my bag in NYC in the early 80s. Late 70s/early 80s was the most recent time I felt unsafe traveling alone by subway at night - a guy was definitely looking me over like he was going to grab my bag and run off at a stop, so I joined 2 women who were also in the subway car and they agreed it looked like he was getting ready, but it didn't occur.I call BS on women can't be out alone. Be sensible and pay attention."
"It's wonderful that there are so many NY women who have no qualms about walking alone at night in NYC. But I thought this was a travel forum. It also might be a spot where parents of young women from out of state who are attending university in NYC might want to check on safety issues and ""bad behavior"".I'm sure the parents of murdered Barnard freshman Tessa Majors would disagree with you ladies. That was last year, btw, not in the 80's. https:/…"
"Being able to walk safely (or otherwise) in any city, is indeed subject appropriate in a Travel Forum."
I don’t want this sage advice to get buried too far down the page:“ Whatever it Is it doesn't seem quite right to play along with her twistedness”
^^^^So true.
I doubt many tourists are wandering through morningside park. Its not a place tourists have any reason to go and wandering through there is certainly not exercising commonsense. In 2019 it was one of the parks with the highest risk of muggings. Honestly if I use your logic I would be more concerned about MS-13 killing me if I walked around Long Island.
"Tessa Majors was an 18 year old, beautiful college freshman from Virginia attending Columbia University's sister school, not a tourist. From the same article:>>Crime in Morningside Park was so rampant in the 1960s and 70s that the New York Daily News reported locals referred to it as ""Muggingside Park."" But by 2001, The New York Times declared that the Morningside ""nightmare"" had ended, writing, ""children are in the playgrounds … and Columbia students routinely settle under trees to read."" >>I guess the New York Times was wrong."
"Long Island is getting its MS-13 problem under control. However, NYC is a ""sanctuary city"", one not interested in removing MS-13 from society.>> The gunman, identified by sources as Ramiro Gutierrez, 26, of Queens, is believed to have shot Abel Mosso, 20, a member of the rival 18th Street gang, on the crowded platform at 90th St. and Elmhurst Ave. in Jackson Heights around 12:45 p.m.>>https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-cri…"

There is no need to gather in violation of social distancing guidelines and put the rest of the population at risk in order to protest though. That is being selfish.

">> Not all NYC college students are saints. Not all NYC students have common sense. >>I was waiting until one of the posters who claimed it's total ""nonsense"" and ""BS"" that there is danger for a woman to walk alone in NYC, before responding.Seriously? You're going to victim-shame an out of state college student for being murdered by a 13 year old NYC thug? The NYT assured people that the ""nightmare"" of the park was over almost two decades ago. An out of state parent doing research on the area might have come across that NYT article and felt reassured. I suppose if Tessa had just been raped instead of murdered that also would have been because of her lack of ""common sense""?Oh wait. Here we go. From yesterday's NY Post: https:/…Was this nurse who beat coronavirus and on her way to work guilty of having no common sense? A group of juvenile thugs, just like the group that jumped my daughter beat her and stole her purse. This poor woman is a Queens resident. So don't tell me NYC is the land of angels and nothing bad ever happens to women walking alone. Your ridiculous anecdotes of how safe it is seem more absurd every day."
"@Lisa MThe locals on this thread were way ahead in drawing appropriate attention to that event, and expressed concern about an environment that could result in an escalation of similar incidents. Please reread posts 433-439 inclusive to refresh your memory.Your post 450, where you referred to your daughter’s mugging in Brooklyn 10 years ago, and then went on to say that NYC was unsafe for women, “pandemic or no pandemic” triggered numerous responses disagreeing with you, including mine. What happened to your daughter 10 years ago was unfortunate, and understandably upsetting, but at the same time irrelevant to what is happening now. In your last post 507, you bring up the same incident that @red expressed concern about in post 433, and others responded with the need for everyone to be extra cautious in NYC at this time. Summary: These are scary times for everyone, everywhere, and they will bring out the worst in some people, as well as the best in others. Everyone is in this together. Non-locals shouldn’t be traveling as tourists to NYC at this time. The locals are already looking out for each other as much as possible. May everyone remain well and stay safe."
"Oh, post #433, the one where the juvenile delinquents were referred to as ""little savages"". That one. Gosh, I am so sorry, I missed that in-depth discussion. Take me out to the woodshed and paddle me. I deserve it. You folks are just so amazingly kind and brilliant. So how many of you filed a complaint on ACS in order to try and keep NYC streets safer in the future? Anyone?"
"Low crime rate doesn't mean ZERO crime rate. Sorry your daughter fell on the wrong side of the statistics. That sucks. And as you point out, she was WITH her boyfriend. So why do you think women walking alone are in more danger? Proverbially, sh$$ happens. Sorry it was your daughter. And low statistics doesn't mean ""walk through Morningside Park"". You couldn't pay me to walk through that park, day or night - I used to live not far. Without victim shaming, college students have many resources available to them at their universities about safety and their environment. But each person makes their own choices. And, while this is true, ""Please reread posts 433-439 inclusive to refresh your memory,"" I noted the change in the situation now as far back as post 236 on April 10. Now is not the time to walk alone after dark. When the emergency is over, I will feel safe again."

People protesting to open up sooner rather than later are frightening - we have conservative numnuts here in our State who's arguing the same. BIG EEK!Edited: 9:02 pm, April 18, 2020 "

"#528:Isn't Cuomo the one who ultimately decides when to reopen the state?I hope you are holding his feet to the fire?Where is the forward plan for opening the state that justifies moving the date two more weeks? I understand he is coordinating w/the other states but I have seen no plan from the gang of 7 that ties to that 5/15 date (or any plan for that matter), have you?"
545 - Since you appear to be an NYS resident have you contacted the Governor's office and your legislators? Have you received any responses?
"Rjr, if you’re watch the press conferences, he answers that question in detail. Arguably too much detail. But he is absurdly transparent about the analysis that is going in to figuring out how and when to reopen. With over 2000 new hospitalizations a day, I don’t really understand why anyone thinks it’s time to reopen. This is killing me (like everyone else). But knowing people who have been very very sick, and seeing the death rate, I am willing to trade worrying about how to pay the bills for a better chance of not getting it. Given a two week infection period, my ignorant analysis would be two 2 week cycles to see where we are with new infections. That puts us at may 15. If we cut it down to a non scary number, and it doesn’t jump to other areas of the state, then it makes sense to start reopening.Edited: 10:42 pm, April 18, 2020 "
Cuomo has been pretty clear about all of this. The real question is where the heck is the help with the testing capacity so we can even see how much this has spread? You got states like Texas gearing up to open and they have tested less than 1% of their population. Its not unreasonable to want actual data on the spread before throwing away the last couple of weeks we have spent on stay at home orders. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFAWVA2IrK8
Exactly. What's the point of all of the sacrifice if we just reopen too soon and everyone keeps getting sick?
#546:I have written to Cuomo three times over the course of the pandemic. He responded the first time which was late March. No responses the last two times (most recent was Friday). My Friday response asked about the action plan with these other governors.My question still hasn't been answered here either. What is the coordinated plan with these other governors? That was supposedly the point for moving the date ahead (per his press conference words) well before the originally set 4/29 date.
"RisaLI agree. I have been self-quarantined since March 6th. In my little Village, as of yesterday there were 127 cases. We have not yet reached peak. Not until we are half way down the down side of the curve should we consider reopening, imho.Back to Bad Behavior - I know this isn't NYC, but this threaad seems to have veered off topic. Talk about ridiculous bad behavior:https:/…"
"#550 - ""My question still hasn't been answered here either. What is the coordinated plan with these other governors?""I don't have any more details than any other member of the public.I do find Cuomo's emphasis on testing/tracing/isolating to be consistent with Dr. Fauci's concerns about testing and reopening too quickly.The Federal plan released a few days ago, as far as I can tell, is a fact based but skeletal framework which lacks any of the specificity, coordination and actionable detail you seem want from Cuomo and the other Governors. I think that testing is key and there are complex issues to be solved. Apparently there are shortages of materials/chemicals needed to perform the tests. Many of the needed supplies are primarily sourced from China and India who are choosing not to export them - an issue the Governors coalitions may not have the leverage to solve on their own.While I understand the itchyness to get out and be ""liberated"", especially if you live somewhere other than NYC where it feels like a miasma that permeates everything, the outbreaks in meat processing plants and native American reservations in the flyover are worrisome. (I have family in places that are not under stay-at-home orders whom I am very worried about as they are at relatively high risk from age and preexisting conditions. They are taking things seriously but many in their area area not.) Some have said ""the cure can't be worse than the disease"" - I think that is true - but in a different sense than they implied. Reopening anywhere without well considered executable fact based plans is a recipe for multiple waves of disease that could in the long run be much more destructive to lives and economic recovery."
"Okay ... so a NYC apartment is a really bad place to keep a tiger! RIP Ming.https:/…ming-tiger-harlem-nyc.htmlEdited: 8:57 am, April 19, 2020 "
"#552 -Thanks for the cogent response.I agree that there has to be plan but my frustration is that NYers were told that the 4/29 date was needed to ""flatten the curve"" which has occurred even according to Cuomo. So the movement of the date out beyond 4/29 well before 4/29 under the guise of coordination with the other governors requires a more detailed justification such as detailing a focused plan from the group of 7 to the public IMO. My concern is that when 5/15 comes (or even before) the date gets moved out again with nebulous justification. I am following the pause rules and will continue to but it needs to be a two-way street as far as the reasoning for the shifting dates otherwise Cuomo will start losing creditability. I am sure I will not be alone especially among those who currently have no income."
553 - Yes that is very bad behavior. But wasn't the tiger discovered and removed from the Harlem apartment in 2003?
554 - I understand your frustration and share much of it.

"556:Do you have an income? Many Americans, whether it is sensible or not, live paycheck to paycheck. So I don't think ""acting out"" is counterproductive from their perspective esp. if they have been told the curve has flattened which was the stated reason for the stay-at-home orders.

"Rjr, I hear your frustration - I share it - but your question assumes that there can be a static plan to implement. There can’t. It’s ever changing and ever evolving. For now, the epicenter is still Manhattan and places within 30-50 miles. They have to make sure that it stays here and continues to recede. Not jump up to your area. None of us want that. Making sure the current plan is working means. Not just numbers going down, but keeping it from spreading. So that means they have to coordinate (for example) transportation, weekend travel, commuting for jobs. They need a system for sanitizing the trains for example. How do you do all that? How do you pay for it? That’s just one example. Then they have to decide who goes back to work, does everyone? Is it by industry or is it by risk factor? How do you tell some people they can work but others can’t? How do you say movie theaters but not broadway? How do you allow the Math club to resume high school activities but not the football team? Is tennis a contact sport? Then you have to make all of those decisions as all of the data on transmission is still so new And evolving. It’s a Herculean task.

">>> But the likely need for extensions seemed obvious to me as it is a dynamic situation that evolves based on public willingness to comply. and with lots of potential for backsliding if people choose to act out in counterproductive ways<<<As an observer from another region, I absolutely agree Kaye. Although we are impacted to a significantly lesser extent, we are going through similar public frustrations, and debating the merits of demands to ‘re-open’ sooner.A rhetoric posed to me from a colleague fairly high up in the tourism industry - those calling for a sooner/earlier easing of lockdown measures, should a catastrophic level of second wave were to hit, and it directly impacts them, their families, their loved ones, their friends, will they accept the the blame for the losses themselves, or will they blame the decision makers even though they demanded it themselves?Risa - excellent Post #562Edited: 11:07 am, April 19, 2020 "

Risa -It is but he should also be pinging Congress to tell them to get back to work on it as well as I believe they have chosen to be on break unless I missed something in that regard.
"566 - Cuomo is on TV right now saying he and the other Governors are asking ""Washington"" to fund / help the states through additional legislation. Hopefully that means all the governors are using their various communication channels to press that message."
"rjr, he is constantly beating up on our senators and House members, haranguing them for not doing enough to get dollars to the state. He has done so publicly and privately. I think you can practically see the bruises on Schumer from his Queens style demands. He hasn't been shy about saying that our Congressional delegation let us down - and I agree, they cut a deal that didn't help NY. (And that's hard for me to say because I have a few friends, including one who threw my bridal shower for me, in that delegation)."
"The mayor is politicizing this because of the tax revenue losses. Yes, we needed to shut down, but doing that creates a loss in revenues. The states want to make their own decisions, but they're certainly not shy about wanting the federal government to help them. The mayor should be talking to the governor, whom by the way started this year with a 6 billion dollar deficit. https:/…I agree with rjr, Congress should be back in session to fund the Paycheck Protection Program, which has run out of money. But Pelosi, is too busy for that:https:/…1250707291587788800As far as an ""opening date"", I bet we go beyond June 1, at a minimum.

"583 - ""Are you saying that no truth comes from the President? "" Like a stopped clock can be right twice a day . He occasionally says things I can agree with. However I think that few of them are deeply held beliefs and are often adopted as a matter of perceived political convenience instead of any real conviction. Think about all his flip flops: D to R, Pro Choice to Pro Life, never asked god for forgiveness but now professes to be a christian ""What does acting like an adult look like to you?""Dignified, able to speak in full sentences, willing to learn, rational and attempting to live up to his oath to the constitution and all citizens - not only his devotees.I have a pretty far right/libertarian leaning combat veteran friend who is appalled."
Expecting a president to tell the truth and act like an adult does not automatically mean someone hates the president.

Didn't realize it was in reaction to anything in particular, but they are apparently all outside CVS or Duane Reade stores. They are about the only places open late (ish) now, so I guess it is not surprising.I was out at about 9 tonight for the first time in a long time and it was a tad quiet for me.I saw something going on on the opposite side of the street that made me glad I wasn't on that side of the street.

"#640, #644The Ontario Ministry of Health has been providing the public with daily updated epidemiological summaries, since at least mid-March in the form of PDF files that one could download. I have kept the occasional one.Early on the epidemiological summaries included the breakdown in the number of cases in the province based on history of travel vs locally acquired. Over time the % of travel related cases decreased compared to community acquired cases; what didn’t decrease was the number of cases with a history of travel to the US compared to other countries. We were actually booked to travel to Palm Springs in March, but cancelled our trip based on the information being published by the Ministry of Health at the time. We were concerned about getting sick while in Palm Springs and not being able to return home when planned, or even if we didn’t get sick while in the US having to go into quarantine for 14 days on returning home to Canada.The earliest daily summary that I kept was actually for March 31st, which I downloaded at the time to share with someone who was still claiming travel between Canada and China as a major source of local infection—the Toronto area actually has the largest concentration of Chinese immigrants in North America, if not the world—and I wanted to show them that that idea was not at all accurate!These are the numbers for the top 10 travel locations from Appendix A of that 11 page March 31st summary (moh-covid-19-report-en-2020-03-31): “Confirmed cases (n=567) of COVID-19 with travel history* by location: Ontario, January 15, 2020 to March 31, 2020”United States 168 (cases)United Kingdom 61Cruise 48Germany 24Spain 21Mexico 20Austria 19Iran 17Philippines 15France 14Italy ranked 18th, with 5 cases, and China ranked 21st with only 4 cases related to travel from mid-January until the end of March 2020..The above information is in keeping with the NYC data showing that Flushing was actually fairly unaffected by COVID-19 around that same time period, as well as news items reporting the majority of NYS infections had originated in Europe, not China: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…Here is a link to our MOH website but I don’t know how to get links to specific previous daily epidemiological summaries, https:/…section-0 . If you look at today’s summary you’ll see that the areas of Ontario with the largest “rate” of confirmed cases is actually at the site of border crossings between Ontario and New York State (Figure 5 on page 9 of today’s summary).Edited: 12:39 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"** areas of Ontario with the largest “rate” of confirmed cases is actually at the site of border crossings between Ontario and New York State. **How many of those 168 U.S. cases between Jan. 15- Mar. 31 were ""initial"" cases? You can't prove that. I guess Canada should have closed its borders much earlier than it did.We were supposed to be having a wonderful time in Turks and Caicos from 3/23 -4/1. We wait all year for that vacation. I rescheduled for December. Hopefully things will be sane by then. I don't blame my President, I blame China, WHO and the CDC for mucking things up."

Apologies to the forum for throwing a few crumbs of feed to the troll as my breakfast entertainment - I'm sufficiently caffeinated now.I still think it is plausible that she is an employee on the night shift at a troll farm elsewhere on the globe.

Not sure what Waco has to do with anything other than someone wanting to try to convince people that the media lies or some nonsense. Below is an article from Time magazine that talks about waco and points out there was an independent arson investigation that the fires were started from inside. Not to mention they had bugs in the place and heard the orders being given inside to start the fires. Just another right wing conspiracy theory that has no basis in fact. https:/…
"Actually, the Netflix mini-series was based on two books, one by one of the survivors and the other by the FBI negotiator. So yes, Time magazine is most definitely fake news. There was never a suicide order and the tear gas was incendiary. What a stain on our FBI, ATF and Justice Department.  A Place Called Wacoby David Thibodeau &Leon WhitesonStalling for Time: My Life as an FBI Hostage Negotiatorby Gary Noesner"
"Can't argue with a right wing nutjob. Everything according to them is fake news if it doesn't support their world view. Just to be clear because Lisa is trafficking in complete conspiracy theories that have been debunked here is some more info below. By the way Gary Noesner only negotiated for the first part of the standoff and his position is that the davidians set the fires which is what the investigations showed, so its not like they got that from his book. https:/…https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-waco-raid-…https:/…"

"Red says:""All my sources rate much higher on factual reporting than the ring wing ones.""Ohhhh. Rated by whom? The DNC? Evidence and truth. Two very important details in arriving at a conclusion about reality. And what is very interesting, to me anyway, is how the omission of certain facts by certain sources leads to a biased perception of what equals truth, or the truth that one side finds preferable.For example, our President did excitedly ramble on about injection and disinfectant, but he wasn't referring to bleach for God's sake. He was referring to UV light. Anyone who thinks he was referring to injecting Lysol has to be a Democrat! And as far as hydroxychloraquine not working, I'm pretty sure Tom Hanks' wife took it and got better. But the Left and our President's detractors will do anything they can to destroy hope that he tries to bring the American people. The Left with their arrogant, pretentious, think they're smarter and better than hard working blue collar, redneck, Bible thumping Americans have divided this country in a way that hasn't been seen since the Civil War. Keep trying to repress the American people with stay-at-home orders and irrational closures of beaches and mountain trails and you will see another civil war. Waco. I've never watched as much Netflix as I have over the past 6 weeks. I remembered the story vaguely. I remember busting my ATF brother-in-law's chops about it some 20 years ago when he opened up the back of his Suburban and I saw the chestload of firepower he had in there. I said, ""Uh oh, hope you're not going to go all Waco on us"", and he cringed and said, ""Yeah, that was a mess"". So which ""truth"" do I believe? Time magazine? Or the story by the FBI negotiator who was on the scene and whose book the Netflix series was based on? I'm going to say the latter. I definitely remember hearing reports of the Davidians being tortured by the government before the tank/gas assault. Deep state tactics, for sure. The Left only gets upset when our troops torture terrorists. American women and children? Eh, that's fine. I know nothing I say will change the minds of brainwashed left-wing ideologues. They are too deeply steeped in their worldview to ever consider that everything they hold dear is wrong. Does Trump talk too much sometimes? Sure. Was Koresh's polygamy and marrying of a 14 year old icky? Yeah. But the children weren't abused. 35 people left the compound because of the negotiations, Koresh didn't use weapons to hold them hostage inside the compound. Freedom. There are a lot of folks on the Left who don't want you to have it. Be prepared to defend your rights."

We’re not interested in rescuing them from bad decisions they've made in the past, we’re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems that they created themselves [with] bad decisions in the past.""In my opinion, he's not off point.

"What McConnell is saying makes no sense. The pensions are hardly the reason for the budget shortfall. Its medicaid. Its all the poor, elderly and uninsured in New York that the government has to provide for, because they can't afford insurance. 1 out of every 3 dollars spent in new york state goes towards medicaid. There is plenty of wasteful spending. Cuomo actually tried to reduce funding to one program that was incredibly wasteful and got sued in court by advocates and wasn't allowed to. Then you had the federal tax changes where we no longer get the tax deduction for state taxes and that caused a lot of higher net worth people to relocate to other jurisdictions and a loss of revenue to New York. The cost of living in NYC is too much for many young people and there has been a population decline spurred even further by the federal removal of the state tax deduction. Younger people are leaving New York state and we are left with a smaller tax base but a huge population that we are required to provide medical care for. Not to mention how the state is aging: "" There are now more residents aged 65 and older in New York State—3.2 million—than the entire population of 21 states. Today, nearly one in six New Yorkers is 65 and above (16 percent), a larger share of the state’s population than ever before.""So medicaid costs are going to be much higher when you have elderly populations and 1 in 7 older new yorkers living in poverty. https://www.syracuse.com/health/2020/02/how-… https://nycfuture.org/research/new-yorks-old…"

We know the reasons why, but this is Cuomo's third term.

The longer we stay shut down, the longer the loss of revenue will occur. There is no easy answer here, we can't just open up tomorrow, but we also can't stay closed for months and months."

@832 Yes Andy you have repeatedly posted that link from January ANYTIME this issue gets mentioned. Of course that is a completely irrelevant point because we aren't talking about a bailout from the situation in January. We are talking about the intervening event of a pandemic that has cost New York a $243 billion loss and new york is the hardest hit state in the country and has been hit harder than any COUNTRY in the world. Talking about the state of the budget in January is rather pointless.
"***Talking about the state of the budget in January is rather pointless.***It's not pointless. You posted a link where Trump dismisses bailouts for ""poorly run"" states led by democrats. NY is a poorly run state, led by a democrat. How can anyone think a 6 billion dollar budget deficit, before this pandemic, equities to good leadership."

Looks like Mayor DeBolshevik is going to close down 40 miles of NYC streets to cars, especially the ones near parks. LOL. That's just brilliant.

Everyone said thank you (as muffled as it sounded :)From my experiences; going out and taking proper precautions are not an issue.

"@red259I suspect those who are all for the concept of heading towards herd immunity have not had anyone in their family come down with a serious case of COVID-19 requiring intubation and ventilation, or even death. Let’s hope they’re not given the opportunity to regret their words.Decent and civil posters on TripAdvisor Forums know that this is an anonymous site and do not expect you to reveal personal details, nor do they want you to."
"#879IMO, the sentiment that’s being expressed [by using the phrase “being a white guy”] is that the VP should NOT be let off the hook from wearing a mask if he chooses to visit a hospital in the midst of a pandemic crisis, especially since he was asked to do so.He’s definitely not setting a good example for others considering that there were times when he seemed to get a lot closer than 6 feet to other individuals, including medical staff and other patients. Not only was he putting those individuals at risk, which everyone defends him on by saying that he’s being regularly tested, but he himself could be exposed to something which would in turn add another level of crisis to this critical moment in time."

"Bad Behaviour or good Trump: FDA gives emergency approval to virus treatment drugThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency approval for the drug remdesivir to be used as a coronavirus treatment, US President Donald Trump has said.Trump said that the CEO of Gilead, which developed the drug, had described the move as an important first step and would donate 1.5 million vials of remdesivir.Vice-President Mike Pence said distribution of the drug to hospitals would begin on Monday.The drug, which was originally developed as a treatment for Ebola, cut the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 to 11 days in one US trial involving hospitals around the world.However, a Chinese study has questioned the drug's usefulness."
"""Until then, do not demonize legal gun owners when there was no incident to speak of."" yea I just have to wait until the next mass shooting right? I don't have problems with lawful gun owners.

People who think that type of action is appropriate aren't people that sound like the most stable individuals."
@908 In terms of Remdesivir there are some studies that show it is helpful. Its not a game changer or anything like that but it may be able to be used as part of a drug cocktail down the line that could make a impact. It seems like a reasonable move by the FDA.
@910 Anything that can help is great. We just need to make sure the right tests are made before reassuring the public that it works.
"@911 agreed but unlike the other drug they never really hyped this one and this seems more science driven. From what I see they are not trying to oversell it , but just indicating that its a step in the right direction that they can build on so it seems like they are keeping expectations in check."

"""There has also never been a mass murderer who was an NRA member""A lot of people don't join or support the organizations they benefit from."
"""There has also never been a mass murderer who was an NRA member""Being that the NRA membership roll is not publicly available I guess we only have the NRA's word about this. I'm sure they are very diligent in checking before making their declaration the person isn't or never has been a member. In the end its a red herring argument, which has nothing to do with anti-government militia members bringing rifles and tactical gear to a government building for a crowded protest during a pandemic."

People who have actually been in combat defending our constitution. Not one of them would indulge in such cosplay. They find the gun waiving LARPing to be irresponsible, a sign of inadequate adulthood and a real source of danger to their 2A rights."
Re 907 re 903 - I think it was to do with the fact the person took the gun to a Christening. A little bit worrying that you are ok with that.
#907 -Please refrain from name calling.

">>>You're assuming they brought weapons so that others feared them<<<Legitimate questions as I’m genuinely interested to understand -If it wasn’t for the purpose of fear/intimidation, what was the purpose of bringing guns? Self defence? If so self defence from whom? Authorities?"
"If it wasn’t for the purpose of fear/intimidation, what was the purpose of bringing guns? You'd have to ask those that attended to know for sure.But, we have the right in this country to bear arms. Each state has it's own rules, but in this case, one can bring firearms into the Michigan state Capitol, so they are simply exercising their rights."
"There are a lot of perfectly legal behaviors that are provocative, or unnecessary. People are free to exercise those choices, of course, and I would probably protect their right to exercise many of them. But are they necessary?Last week at the farmer's market, one person bought up ALL of the multigrain and whole wheat loaves of bread, early in the morning. The vendor said she didn't want to run out. Totally legal. Totally selfish. I was so happy they had bread today. Toilet paper hoarding is legal too. But not good citizenship.So, I question (pretty rhetorically, intended as food for thought, not a real answer): at such a volatile time, when everyone is in emotional crisis and mental health is precarious, is bringing guns into a State Capitol necessary? Is it a good idea? What would happen if just one person lost their grip on reality, one member of the State Capitol Police felt threatened? If their intent is reasonable discourse, could it have been achieved without guns? Like I said, not questioning their right to carry guns in Michigan right this moment. Not questioning the lady's right to buy up all of the bread. Not questioning the right to hoard toilet paper. Not questioning the right to go to your house in the Hamptons and buy up all of the meat and toilet paper. Not questioning the right to do a lot of things. But is it a good act of citizenship?And has anyone noticed how clear the air is? My allergies have not been acting up at all!"
Oh please. Common sense tells you why they brought guns. Intimidation. Even the Republican state senate majority leader in Michigan called them jackasses.
"***People are free to exercise those choices, of course, and I would probably protect their right to exercise many of them. But are they necessary?******is bringing guns into a State Capitol necessary? Is it a good idea? What would happen if just one person lost their grip on reality, one member of the State Capitol Police felt threatened?***Some people are very fearful of firearms, I get that. Bringing firearms into the state Capitol is legal, so for them it was necessary and their right. ""What would happen"" is hypothetical, nothing did happen. Is it a good idea for police to carry firearms? What if something happens? I'm not trying to challenge you Risa, just saying that Michigan has a law that allows what they did, and nothing happened. Just because people carry guns, it does not mean that they're criminals or looking to partake in criminal activity."
"I see it as an example of passive-aggressive behaviour on the part of some participants who choose to take their firearms along to what is supposed to be a peaceful demonstration.The problem with passive-aggressive behaviour though is that it often triggers anger and aggression in others, hence the concern about the potential for a situation like this to escalate into a crisis that was not intended by the participants.Scary behaviour no matter how you look at, imo!"

"Au contraire, the Constitution and Bill of Rights applies to everyone."
">>> How would people react if it was BLM protesters, or Muslims, or undocumented immigrants, or any marginalized group?<<<That’s a very interesting question Warriorjan, from several different perspectives. Although the idea of unfounded associating of marginalised groups, with terrorism or acts of violence is unfair, I believe the reaction would have been vastly different - from at least one side of the fence. Which brings us to perceptions about the reasons why some feel they need to exercise their right to bear arms. One estimate puts the total ownership of guns in the US is amassed by only 30% of the population. An interesting aspect is that according to many articles I’ve read, the predominant reasons for gun ownership is self defence, and recreation. Dig further and the advocates appear to indicate it is part of their identity and essential to their freedom. So going back to what Warriorjan asked - if the above (essential to their identity) was indicated by the marginalised groups, would everyone feel safe if nothing happens? And further to that, what are US gun owners perceptions of people carrying guns in other countries?"
"Kaye has touched on another interesting and overlapping aspect about the history. Not directly related but intertwined - wasn’t there an academic article published by the Hoover Institute several years ago about the impact of the constitution on public policies, and the government’s ability to change with challenges faced in the present?"
"The Secret History of Gunshttps:/…Governor Reagan told reporters that afternoon that he saw “no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons.” He called guns a “ridiculous way to solve problems that have to be solved among people of good will.” In a later press conference, Reagan said he didn’t “know of any sportsman who leaves his home with a gun to go out into the field to hunt or for target shooting who carries that gun loaded.” The Mulford Act, he said, “would work no hardship on the honest citizen.”"
"""I'm not trying to challenge you Risa, just saying that Michigan has a law that allows what they did, and nothing happened. Just because people carry guns, it does not mean that they're criminals or looking to partake in criminal activity.""I expressly acknowledge that it is not illegal or criminal. The fact that nothing happened ""this"" time doesn't mean it couldn't have. We have lots of laws because of the risks of ""something happening."" and we warn lots of people not to exercise rights because they're not good citizenship.It's legal to smoke cigarettes and cigars in open places...but I recall being at a Concert in the Park when someone was smoking a cigar nearby. It was miserable. Sure, it was legal. But good citizenship? Not so much. It's my personal OPINION (just an opinion, we're all entitled to them) that guns shouldn't be in state capitals, and certain other places. But my opinion doesn't matter in this case. Having a right to do something doesn't mean that it is the right thing to do. We are on edge. I would hate to see bad things happen for no good reason.Water guns are perfectly safe and legal. But parents teach children of certain disenfranchised communities not to play with water guns in certain public places for their own safety. That's sad but a fact of our times that it is not safe for themselves to do so. We're in a time where we should consider looking at the big picture about whether exercising our rights at the expense of community interests. (also not fact, an opinion. Oy, I've been watching Gov Cuomo too much and his incessant need to state what is fact and what is opinion.)"

"That’s quite the article Kaye, thank you for linking that. I had no idea of such extensive and history, nor that the US in fact for almost 50 years, had gun control so similarly enforced in many countries around the world in the present day.It’s incredible to read that two people who had so influenced gun laws (Karl T Frederick and Justice Scalia), both had notable sentiments/opinions expressing concerns;“Preserving the ability of law-abiding people to have guns, Frederick would write elsewhere, “lies in an enlightened public sentiment and in intelligent legislative action. It is not to be found in the Constitution.”And this“Nothing in the opinion, Scalia wrote, should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms”The latter correlates with Risa’s sentiments about what could happen when guns are in possession in the wrong hands"

">>> One can say the same about any weapon that is used inappropriately, such as knives, bats, etc<<<Absolutely agree Andy and can not refute that. No question about it.But it’s just the sheer scale of gun related homicides vs non related is staggering - 75% vs 25% - which would suggest that weapons used other than a firearm is less likely to kill or result in a death, and much less likely to cause a ‘mass’ scenario as mentioned by Red.Even more staggering when less than 5% of all gun related homicides are accounted for in mass shootings. Which (based only on numbers) means 95% of gun related homicides receive the level of media attention that often follows a mass shooting incident.The figures from Pew Research and CDC;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htmhttps:/…Edited: 3:05 pm, May 02, 2020 "

"Even if ex-employees are not entitled to medical coverage, SOME employers are continuing it for several months because of the crisis.Also note that in US there is federal law called COBRA that gives certain people (former employees, former spouses, widows) who would otherwise have lost health coverage (and that includes all medical, dental, vision, etc) the right to continue coverage for period specified in law as long as they pay full premium -- both employer and employee shares -- plus small admin fee. For terminated employees I believe max period is 18 months. Although employee has to pay full cost, this is generally less expensive than buying on open market, with better benefits. When I did COBRA several yrs ago my premium was around $700 a month and included dental. When it ended and I had to go on an individual plan premium was about $1400 a month and did not include dental. BY the time I turned 65 and qualified for Medicare my premiums had gone up to $1800 a month (tho was a comprehensive plan with both in and out of network benefits, low copays, deductibles, etc.). I would have to read law to know if COBRA distinguishes between furloughed and terminated employees. May just boil down to whether the event results in loss of employer coverage.Edited: 6:33 pm, May 05, 2020 "

"This pandemic has made clear (not like it wasn’t clear before frankly) that our system of obtaining and paying for health care doesn’t work.

"I may be mistaken, but to the extent there is private insurance in Germany (or is it Switzerland?), it is tied to employment. Further, if a person leaves that employer, the coverage continues until the individual is covered by another employer's plan, so could go on indefinitely.When the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare"") was being negotiated several years ago, there was at one point a proposal to let COBRA eligibility continue indefinitely -- until an individual either became eligible for a new employer's plan or qualified for Medicare. That would have been great for people who wanted to go out on their own or work somewhere where health coverage was not offered. But alas it didn't make it into the final bill."

Its rather pathetic with all the medical providers who got sick from inadequate PPE that people would suggest that the administration got the job done. The second link is our president being told directly by a nurse about how PPE is sporadic and she has had to use the same (single use) mask for the past several weeks. To which he quickly jumped on her to suggest well some people have PPE. Yea so there is still PPE shortages in this country so don't act like the problem has been solved. It hasn't even though Trump wants to tell the country it has.https:/…https:/…
And there are many groups on local levels who have taken the initiative to help get PPE where needed. People know the problem hasn't been solved.
Maybe Jared used his Russian friends to procure the supply of PPE from Russia.
"On the upside, going forward NY State will require hospitals to have on hand a 90 day supply of PPE and other essential equipment. In addition, the 7 state consortium formed by NY State and 6 of its neighbors will be buying as a bloc. Hopefully this will give them more negotiating power and lower prices. Maybe they will also buy security together to avoid those situations where state authorities recently managed to buy badly needed supplies, only to have them literally ""hijacked"" by federal ""agents"" who refused to disclose on whose behalf they were being seized (perhaps Jared and his fraternity brothers?).I hope the consortium gives some thought to future threats -- not only pandemics, but also things like massive cyberattacks from Russia. The possibility of a serious cyberattack scares the living daylights out of me, especially if Jared and Ivanka were once again put in charge of the federal response. All states really need to be prepared to deal with these issues on their own."
">> On the upside, going forward NY State will require hospitals to have on hand a 90 day supply of PPE and other essential equipment. <<I saw that somewhere, but if I recall correctly, he also said that the 90 day supply needed to be at the level of what was required to meet the needs of the hospitals during the recent crisis.There are a few problems with turning that goal into a reality: 1. There are currently no supplies available anywhere to meet and maintain that need, and it will be a long time before the international manufacturers will be able to meet the current worldwide needs. 2. Most of the manufacturing of masks, gowns, gloves, swabs, etc takes place in China. 3. The current administration’s recent targeting of China is not going to facilitate procurement of the necessary items, imho. 4. Time will be needed for manufacturing to ramp up locally. 5. The cost of MADE IN THE USA products will be significantly higher. 6. Going forward there will be a tendency for hospitals to revert to purchasing cheaper PPE made abroad—because memories are short.Canada was a major hotspot for SARS in 2003; hospitals were poorly prepared to meet their PPE needs. Decisions were made then to never allow staff to be put at risk again due to poor stockpiles—but here they are again!The only solution may be for federal governments to maintain adequate stockpiles for this kind of event going forward.Edited: 7:09 pm, May 06, 2020 "

"Here in Syracuse, there was a guy with a gun at a ""Liberate NY"" rally. The next time anyone had notice of him, there was a noise complaint inside a supposedly closed bar. When the cops got there, they heard loud music playing inside. When the cops attempted to enter they discovered that the place was locked. The cops broke in & discovered that there was a bunch of people inside & the guy with the gun at the rally argued with the cops that they had no business disrupting his party. So not only did the leader expose people to Covid-19 but if a fire broke out, everyone inside might have died since the doors were locked."

"""the only solution may be for the federal government to maintain adequate stockpiles""That will not be viable in the United States. The federal stockpile is for their own use, not for the people of the country who paid for the supplies via their tax dollars. The federal stockpile is for those who do not ask nasty questions, most especially if you are female (being a minority makes it worse) or criticize the power that be. The federal stockpile is not for those in need, it is for those who will praise and articulate that praise on a constant basis to be rewarded with the stockpile supplies.

"Cold, Crowded, Deadly: Virus Stalks Workers at U.S. Meat PlantsWith thousands of workers sick, plants are closing and the food supply is faltering.https:/…At least 10 workers say their supervisors or infirmary staff sent them back to the line feeling sick. One eight-year Cargill veteran, who calls herself Anabel, says she worked the entire week of March 16 while sick. She says her supervisor in the beef division ignored her health complaints, and a plant nurse gave her acetaminophen and told her to keep working because her temperature was less than 100.4F, the CDC-directed threshold for coronavirus concern. At one point, Anabel says, she overheard her supervisor telling the nurse he was “tired” of so many workers getting sick. Anabel got so weak she could hardly stand up, but she didn’t leave because she didn’t want points on her record from unexcused absences. “Every time I coughed, there was someone in front of me and next to me,” says Anabel, who tested positive for Covid-19 on March 24. “All my co-workers got sick.”"

"‘It’s too early to go back’: Workers fear for their health and finances as states rush to reopenhttps:/…Some workers are returning to the labor force out of financial duress, taking jobs they may view as unsafe after struggling to obtain government aid. Others are under pressure from their states to return to their old roles or risk losing unemployment benefits entirely. In Ohio, which has encouraged businesses to report employees who don’t come back to work, approximately 600 employers have already turned in about 1,200 workers, the state’s labor agency said.But advocates for workers’ rights say that average employees have been thrust into an unsafe, unhealthy position, with few viable options for recourse if they contract the coronavirus on the job. The White House and Republicans in Congress are pushing to create new policies that would block employees from suing their employers if they contract the virus at work.“We’re making folks make the near-impossible choice between going to work and earning income to put food on the table, and protecting their health,”"
@1065 Yes unfortunately in the rush to reopen the country in places that don't meet the CDC guidelines the most vulnerable people are the ones who get forced to work in unsafe conditions and if they refuse they can lose their jobs. The get the country open crowd are likely not the ones working in places for low pay that are facing high rates of infection and maybe death.

@1068 yea the personal responsibility thing is a joke for low level workers. Employers should not have immunity if they force people to work in an unsafe workplace. There should be a reasonable person standard about if a company took appropriate precautions. It would have been nice if the administration did not bury the CDC documents that outline standards for a safe reopening. What we need is uniform guidelines based on science that establish standards for the safe reopening of companies in various industries.
Nice. Some people because of delays by some state governments in updating their systems haven't been able to get unemployment and haven't seen a dime and now the governor of Arkansas is reopening and saying they must go back to work and if they refuse and collect unemployment it will be considered fraud.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coronavirus-u…
Being that Trump's own valet tested positive earlier this week and Trump has been interacting with him in recent days its kinda appalling that they did this event with 96-100 year old men so he could get his photo op. He couldn't even bother to wear a mask. A member of Pence's staff was just announced as also being positive. https:/…
"Nothing appalling red, unless you're living in fear. The likelihood, and this is just an opinion, is that the valet driver probably never even got close enough to Trump. I would also think it's safe to bet that Trump is getting tested every single day."
1072 - Red - Since Trumps personal valets duties include serving him his food and beverages anyone exposed should not be interacting with senior citizens https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/the-…
"Fear? Huh? Approaching 76,000 deaths and you don't think its appropriate who has a known COVID exposure to wear a mask when around 96-100 year old men? What a ridiculous statement to imply that is somehow being fearful. ""The likelihood, and this is just an opinion, is that the valet driver probably never even got close enough to Trump."" White house valets are the personal assistants to the president. They have daily interaction with him. They are the people who bring him newspapers, food, whatever he requests etc. This valet was in the room with Trump as of Tuesday which was the day he started showing symptoms."
@Kaye apparently you are living in fear because you are saying something that is commonsense!
"1076 - Red - Situational awareness is important.Fear, like pain, is a signal there is something you need to pay attention to and then act prudently and appropriately. The implication that experiencing fear leaves people curled up in a fetal position crying and shaking would amuse my combat veteran friends"
"Kaye and red, the weird thing is, he himself has some very weird health condition that probably affects his immune system ( so weird that I don’t remember exactly what, although it involves if I remember right, veins and inflammation). He is a nice guy, and truly self-made, but this attitude baffles many of us. I generally don’t engage, but his response to one of my FB links couldn’t go I responded to, at least initially. And the whole opening thing is about driving down the unemployment requests. I saw a post by a restaurant owner in Georgia who said they didn’t want to open, if they don’t open their insurance won’t cover for business interruption, and their employees will get unemployment denied. Same reason why the White House doesn’t want to expand testing -it’s bad for the numbers."
"***Fear? Huh? Approaching 76,000 deaths and you don't think its appropriate who has a known COVID exposure to wear a mask when around 96-100 year old men? What a ridiculous statement to imply that is somehow being fearful.***Fear, yes fear. How many of those 76,000 deaths have been from underlying health conditions? Trump said he had very little contact around the valet driver. Since Trump is likely getting tested every single day, it would be known if he had tested positive. He's clearly not worried and nor should he be, you can't live in fear. And for those WWII vets, they are voluntarily participating, so they are clearly not fearful either."
"1078 - Warriorjan, I know he has Rosacea but isn't that more of a cosmetic skin disease?"
"I think there has been speculation about Trump having rosacea, or perhaps he has side effects from some medication he has been taking. My cousin-in-law has something that I had never heard of, and so complicated that it was very difficult to diagnose, and hence I can't remember what it is. Other world leaders did go into self-quarantine and isolation when they had been exposed. I don't think a mask is too much to ask. It would set an example for others."
"Potentially exposing others to a virus because you are too vain to wear a mask isn't bravery. Its called ignorance, selfishness and stupidity. Unreal that you are on here trying to claim people are fearful because they advocate for people to follow the appropriate precautions set out by the medical community."
"***Intentionally exposing others to a virus***Potentially, big difference. As I mentioned before, it's likely that they're testing the President every single day."
"""Potentially, big difference. As I mentioned before, it's likely that they're testing the President every single day."" - as seen in my post above I had already corrected the word. The tests are not 100% accurate. False negatives are not uncommon at all when it comes to these tests."
Put your mask on folks:https:/…
"Yeah, you conveniently corrected the word, that's why I posted what I did, before your correction. You're too much red, we need more testing, but wait, the tests are not 100% accurate."
Obviously there is a massive difference between people who have known COVID exposures and the risk of a false negative so the additional precaution for them of avoiding contact with others during the incubation period vs saying that we shouldn't have testing at all because there are some false negatives. Anyone with basic commonsense would understand the flaw in that argument.
This afternoon Trump referred to the illness as the “plague”and complained that the reporters were worried about the WW II veterans catching it but not about him catching it. There is now a positive case on my aunt’s wing at her nursing home. We just found out. Hoping she tests negative.

"@1138 Some people over here use words like ""mainstream media"" also but it's a kind of hollow terminology in my honest opinion. The homogeneous group called ""liberal mainstream media"" is non existing. It's a created image of a unified opposing army that isn't really there that way. There are a lot of media, all with their own point of view. And important: the fact that media are mainstream doesn't make them good or bad or liberal or conservative for that matter. And not all liberal media are the same like all conservative media are not the same either. It is also a strange idea to think media always pick a side. Maybe some of them do but not all of them. Media try to bring facts. Yes, they bring facts from a certain point of view and newspapers have columns with opinions but when good media bring facts they just bring facts. And there only can be one version of a fact. It makes me sick when politicians or citizens suggests it's always about picking sides, like there is only black and white.

The only plausible explanation is that some of those who continue to support him cannot admit that they may have made a mistake; others continue to be fans because they have many of the same racist, narrow-minded views of various other countries, as well as their citizens or descendants; and then there are the few who see him as the best way to achieve their own goals, whatever those may be.I will soon be 62 years old and have lived for the last 61 years in Toronto. The majority of TV news, sports and entertainment (except for ice hockey) programs that we watched growing up in Canada were American. I am old enough to remember the behaviour and character of DJT in the 1980s - 1990s as depicted then in all media forms. He was someone few US citizens at the time would have wanted representing or leading their country; the current person is very much the same man he was then, he has just learned that the art of the “con” is going to get him further than the art of the “deal” and he now uses that knowledge to con a large number of his followers. Most of the members of government in his own party eventually realized that they could just sit back and let him be the con artist he is, and they too would benefit in ways that mattered to them. Morality and Ethics has been trumped by Greed and the need for Power: DJT didn’t have to shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, as long as he avoided wearing a tan suit! Or, maybe all he really needed to do in order to gain their support was wear a fake orange tan to prove he wasn’t the same as the widely and internationally respected President before him. I hope history will not be kind to those who enabled the orange man’s behaviour.Edited: 5:06 pm, May 12, 2020 "

Wow, that's quite an observation, coming from someone who isn't even a US citizen. No one is perfect and for those that hate Trump, it doesn't matter what he does, they simply don't like him and want him to fail. These are the same people that support CNN and the other outlets that are simply out to trash Trump at every corner. I laugh because I've had a few members pm me a while back becuase I made some comments about supporting the President. Those members were glad that I was being positive towards our President and were tired of seeing anti-Trump post after post. We can all agree that no one is perfect, but the liberal talking points are ridiculous. Really now, who wants to see the leader of your country fail, I'll just never get that.

"1167 - Under fire, President Trump drops his Mar-a-Lago dock plan — for nowhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/sty…President Trump has temporarily withdrawn a controversial dock proposal at his Palm Beach resort that had raised larger questions about the legality of the change of his official residency from New York to Florida.The decision, which was disclosed in a letter sent to the Palm Beach mayor and town council on Monday, comes three days after The Washington Post published a story that outlined assertions by local attorneys who argue that agreements Trump entered into with the town prevent him from living at the resort, and may have precluded him from legally registering to vote in Florida. (Trump has said he voted by mail in Florida’s Republican presidential primary this year.)“One prevalent issue remains lingering, whether President Trump still considers Mar-a-Lago Club his residence,” Stambaugh said Tuesday. “He still can’t have it both ways. It’s either a club or a residence — not both. Florida’s voting laws apply to citizen Trump. If he resides there, he will have to close the club.”"

"Re # 1212 and 1216 Most of the job growth enjoyed before the current crisis was due to actions taken in Obama administration.ALL of job losses in last two months, the worst since the great depression of the 1930s, as well as sagging value of retirees' 401k accounts, can be attributed solely to the failure of the President to acknowledge the likely effects of a pandemic and to refuse to plan for it (not to mention his termination of a group put in WH by previous administration SPECIFICALLY to plan for such events, and don't try to blame this on Bolton again). How could someone touted as the world's greatest businessman/dealmaker be so totally, completely stupid he'd think (and publicly admit) a deadly virus would ""go away by itself in April, like a miracle"" or was ""under control' because there ""were only"" 15 cases on a specific date in late Feb or early Mar?He's the laughingstock of the international community. Madonna contributed more than the US to an international group in Europe set up to work COLLABORATIVELY on vaccine research."
"So you don't think that under Trump, the U.S.. rid the mid east of the ISIS caliphate? Really, Red? And you cite Vox as a source? What very bad behavior on your part. I also saw you cheered the NYPD tackling and arresting a Mom with a young child. That was horrific. I am usually a big supporter of our 1st responders but I think those were MTA NYPD and they are having some serious issue with harrassing minorities during this pandemic. Everything is upside down and backwards when you let criminals out of jail for Covid and try and arrest a Mom because her mask slipped down. For God's sake, the toddler had a mask, too! Shame on the NYPD, shame on Mayor DeBolshevik and shame on Cuomho."

"Funny how you leave out key facts. Such as that she had previously been removed from the station two times before this after she simply refused to wear the mask (she was told she could wear the mask or leave) and that she snuck back in both times. That she was screaming in the cops face, that she was threatening to cough on the cops, that the cops were begging her not to act this way in front of her child, that the cops were directing her out of the station for the third time (again because she was refusing to wear a mask) they weren't trying to arrest her, that she tried to go back into the station instead of out which is why the cop put his or her hand up to her and that her response was to smack the cop.

"Delta Wing your post # 1211 was so articulate and eloquent for a non US citizen of course!! It is rewarding to know there are still people who reasonable. People who do not want their own rule of law, people who do not insist that only their agenda is correct and all others are wrong. People who do not need to ridicule and destroy those with differing views.Here in the US that is the case (in my opinion). We have 1 news channel (more opinion than news) that attacks anything and everything that is not a talking point issued to them by the federal government. They are more akin to propaganda than news. Their viewers, more accurately their followers as it is a cult, believe all that is said. Their followers allow their heads to be filled with thoughts and ideas that are parroted by the state anchors. They play the role of victim. If you are not for their concepts then you are against them. You experienced this yourself by a poster who infers you deranged because you actually have a mind that thinks. The same poster who insults you because you live in Canada, in his head Canadians should not be allowed to comment on US activities. This is what Amercia has to deal with.Let history be the judge of this president- we know where that is going. The world laughs at him and by extension laughs at the USA. They don't laugh at the people of the USA just the individual who the UN general assembly laughed at in his first speech there. At present we need laughter, we also need leadership that cares about the country rather than themselves and know how to lead. We have more than enough laughter due to him, we have much too little leadership and absolutely no concern for the people of this country except those who financially benefit him or acquiesce to his demands of subservience.Ask not what you can do for your country, ask what you can do for our dear leader."

"On Tuesday senate majority leader McConnell falsely smeared President Obama with the claim that no type of game plan for a pandemic was left by Obama's administration. Ignoring the fact that the current potus has held office since 2017 with time to formulate his own plan. Regardless, tonight on fox news the lying senator from Kentucky admitted he was wrong (did not say he intentionally lied). This admission comes only after Dr Rick Bright testified in congress that there was a response plan from the Obama administration for the new administration only for the plan to be ignored by the current potus.Bad behavior by the lying senator.

"Even If You're Trying To Avoid Grubhub By Calling Your Favorite Restaurant Directly, Grubhub Could Still Be Charging It A Feehttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessa…Here’s how phone fees work: Grubhub (which also owns Seamless, MenuPages, Tapingo, and LevelUp) generates a unique phone number for each restaurant on its platform; it appears on the restaurant’s Grubhub or Seamless page and redirects to the restaurant's own phone line (a restaurant cannot list its own phone number on its Grubhub or Seamless page). The redirect number can also appear higher in Google search results (including the Google panel for that business) than the restaurant’s own line. This leads some customers to call it even if they don’t intend to use Grubhub. Some restaurant owners have also raised this concern about Yelp, which lists Grubhub numbers, according to Vice."

@1269 Dorian's has always been the hangout for self-entitled preppys. Same types that have been there since the 1980s when the preppy killer was there.

I wish they would go ahead and let them reopen restaurants and bars, if for no other reason than to just get these fools off the streets. They are making a lot of noise -- shouting, laughing, etc. -- and I can only assume it's going to get worse as the temps rise."

It also reminds me of that saying, “A fish rots from the head down.”Please, someone give me a good reason, or explain to me in a way that is logical, what it is about a large part of the populace that makes them such &$!#% selfish idiots! The weather has been “absolutely gorgeous” at some point EVERYWHERE that the pandemic has wreaked its havoc. Kids in Madrid were locked indoors for SIX WEEKS without being able to go outside at all: “In Spain, where the crisis is also easing, the streets echoed again with children’s shrieks of joy and the clatter of bicycles after youngsters under 14 were allowed out of their homes with one parent for up to an hour of play.” https:/…What is wrong with people? I don’t think there’s a “new” Kawasaki-like syndrome suddenly showing up in the US at higher rates than elsewhere...there are just more idiotic parents who don’t follow recommendations that have been put in place for everyone’s wellbeing, including children!Sorry, but this “non-US citizen” has lost her cool tonight."
"Its very easy for someone who doesn't live in NYC to say this behavior is ok. For those of us that live here and need to walk these streets to get to the store and run essential errands we shouldn't have to walk through a crowd of unmasked drunks. Nobody is saying people can't go outside and do what they need to do, but gathering in unmasked groups on the sidewalks to drink is certainly not appropriate by any standard and is selfish.Edited: 10:50 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"Call the cops then red, get a megaphone and protest, or just go another way. Just put a mask on, what are you afraid of?"
"But it would be nice to be able to be out and about, say taking a walk, without having to worry about negotiating crowds of sidewalk drinkers. To the best of my knowledge, sidewalk drinking in crowds was not legal before the pandemic (in my neighborhood at least it's a phenomenon the police have monitored), so I see no reason why it should be now. Furthermore, by sending these people indoors to do all their crowd drinking, eating and shouting I can only assume the greater portion of infection risk is going in with them. If they want to infect themselves (and I hear that is popular w/some young people in some places), that's fine with me."
Whatever Andy your opinion and advice is worthless as far as I am concerned. The fact that our are condoning this behavior just shows you for a troll and nothing more. I won't be engaging with you any further.
"I’m not condoning the behavior, but I understand why it’s happening. Troll, I think not, you just seem so worried and fearful, unable to figure out what to do."
@1282 absolutely correct. Some people seem to think simply wanting to walk down the sidewalk without unnecessary exposures is being fearful or some nonsense. When people engage in this unnecessary behavior they are being disrespectful of everyone else in the neighborhood who also live there. Pretty straightforward.

"I have started wearing a mask in stores a week ago. Before that I would wear a mask only when going to residences for seniors for work. The problem I had with the mask was the fact that it fogged up my glasses. I told a nurse at a residence and she showed me that if I twisted the elastic it was better and she was right.I don't wear the mask in my car, at home or walking on the street, but I wear it in stores and have it with me if I feel I will be in a situation where social distancing will not be possible.I do it and understand the concept being wearing it, what I do not understand is that we are told that it's been done in China for years, but, as far as I understand, the virus came from China, so how was wearing a mask for them a solution to spreading the virus?"
@1289 Someone should explain to her that people who refuse to wear face masks aren't a protected class that is being discriminated against. Just one more example of an individual that the education system has completely failed.
"""Can anyone tell me what kind of ""medical condition"" would mean someone ""cannot"" wear a mask,""Usually it is a person with a heart condition or lung condition. My husband had heart surgery and the mask does cause him to stop in the middle of a leisure walk to catch his breath. The obstruction caused by a mask can also cause his heart beat to increase. We have to walk with a monitor to ensure it is within acceptable range. If he did not wear a mask this would not be an issue. But, for him it is not a case of not being able to wear a mask. It is being able to manage when he needs to stop and catch his breath or reduce his heart beat due to limited oxygen. We are currently looking into a fitness high altitude mask; with the probability it would assist.I am sure there are worse cases than his.Edited: 6:43 pm, May 17, 2020 "

"""what I do not understand is that we are told that it's been done in China for years, but, as far as I understand, the virus came from China, so how was wearing a mask for them a solution to spreading the virus?"" Not sure I understand the question. China was really able to suppress the virus through drastic actions. They have had some flareups which they are working on suppressing, but when this virus started spreading it wasn't told to the public for several weeks which is why their situation got soo out of control, but its not like before this all chinese people were wearing masks all the time. They might wear them on high pollution days or maybe if they are sick or something, but not on a routine basis so they weren't all wearing them when the virus initially spread undetected."
Even if she did have a medical condition that would not allow her to wear a mask (honestly it sounds like she is just lying about that) the store is still not obligated to let her in. They offered to pickup the items and bring them to her. Apparently what she wanted to buy was too private. Don't they see the products when they get rung up anyway? Aren't they going to see her walking around the store with those products after she picks them out? In terms of the credit card concern has she never been in a restaurant where you have to give your credit card to the waiter and they take it out of sight to ring up the cost? Her excuses sounded quite lame and it seemed more like she just didn't want to wear a mask and was going to say whatever to try to get her way.

So sad that Lisa's post #1341 was removed. I guess those that reported her post couldn't handle a positive comment about our President. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) released the following statement back in April:https://www.ptcommunity.com/wire/ama-prefers…
"@1343 - While this article has some relevance I think the key question here is, is it sensible for a world leader to state this information publicly? There is still research going on to establish if this drug, in combination with 2 others can prevent people with COVID-19 from becoming seriously ill. There have also been studies suggesting it could actually be dangerous. Nobody, as far as I'm aware has suggested there are benefits to taking it as a preemptive measure if you have no symptoms. It's also widely accepted that this, and other anti-malarial drugs can have some pretty serious side-effects. Let's also not forget the fact that there are people with existing chronic illnesses that rely on these drugs to manage their own conditions.If his doctor is happy to prescribe then fine, that's up to him and the patient. However I would be very keen to know what, if any benefit sharing this information would have? When you know you have influence over millions of people and many will likely now want to do the same, would it not be sensible to keep that information to yourself unless you can be 100% sure that the impact will be a positive one?"
"Thanks, SpringerAndy. I just popped back to see if anyone got the vapors from my post and I guess they did ... LOL. Ohhh,ohhhh, no, she said something positive about the President! We must silence her! No one should read that right wing nut-job's opinion!  Buncha fascists in here."

"I sent a message to a TA staff to look into that (I am sure) one individual that is reporting all posts.I will say this; My husband is Republican - I am not.My husband voted for Trump - I did not.My husband is white - I am not.We have known each other for 20 + yearsHowever, through our political disagreements, we still have respect for each other and each political views.There is a huge difference between a debate and pure hate for the other political party. This thread has shown pure hate for a political party that one does not align.When one poster does not agree with another posters political views you see the following: -1. Fighting in place of a healthy debate.2. Name calling (accusations of no common sense, stupid, troll etc).3. Pure hate (especially towards Republicans).4. A place where ones posters news source is not respected as any others (for political reinforcement).5. Posters see their political views as superior.6. Having posts removed that one does not agree.If you do not agree with someones political view and unable to debate - but throw hate -- you are part of the problem. For me - childish behavior.If anyone (as seen on this thread) came for my husband with such hate and venom - this non-Republican would stand up for him. He would also do the same for me. I guess that is what us grown A** men call maturity. Along with the ability to respect another persons political beliefs.I know my husbands respect for another persons political view (different from his) comes from being gay, A gay republican is often disliked/alienated in the gay community. So he knows the ""pain"" of being hated and judged for being a Republican.My respect for others - come from being a person of color where judgment is frequent.Edited: 3:37 pm, May 19, 2020 "

I asked him to show me how I twisted his words when they were directly quoted. His response .Some people like to play victim. Some people like to accuse others of bad behavior. Some people like to accuse others of name calling. I see these same people exhibiting the same behavior they accuse others of and doing it themselves. Doing it prior to others do. I see posters whining about their posts deleted and the posts of those they agree with deleted. When posts they do not like are deleted, again . My post on bad fathers day behavior was deleted. No doubt because the bad behavior was by potus in pushing down his TEN year old son on a mountain to win a ski race. The source of the quote was the child who was pushed over.

A place where ones posters news source is not respected as any others (for political reinforcement).5. Posters see their political views as superior.6. Having posts removed that one does not agree.If you do not agree with someones political view and unable to debate - but throw hate -- you are part of the problem. For me - childish behavior.If anyone (as seen on this thread) came for my husband with such hate and venom - this non-Republican would stand up for him. He would also do the same for me.I guess that is what us grown A** men call maturity.

"The Hot New Far-Right Trend: Claiming a Disability to Avoid Wearing a Maskhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hot-new-fa…As with many successful disinformation ploys, the claims have a kernel of truth. If a person has a legitimate disability that prevents them from wearing a mask, the ADA might require businesses to let them in. But even in the case of a legitimate disability, Gostin noted, a business would be legally allowed to bar a person who was “endangering the public.”And if a person were to prove medically unable to wear a mask, it would only be doubly important for those around them to wear protective equipment.“A person with asthma or other respiratory problems is a highly vulnerable individual,” Gostin said. “If they were to get COVID-19, it’d be a stronger likelihood that they might get a very serious illness, resulting in hospitalization or death. They’re more likely to contract the illness if exposed, so we need widespread masking to protect persons with disabilities.”Flat Earthers, scripts and ""hall passes"" oh my"

"“Actually several doctors have said that common (non N95 masks) are useless.”That may be true but I guarantee you that every single doctor looking after someone who is positive for the virus would rather wear a “non N95 mask” than no mask at all.Also, if any of those doctors were advising someone who had tested positive for COVID, they would certainly recommend that the individual isolate themselves from others and if/when contact was necessary with a caregiver, the caregivers should wear a mask or other face coverings.Edited: 6:03 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"""Actually several doctors have said that common (non N95 masks) are useless."" Actually that is exactly NOT what the studies show. I posted links to about studies that show how masks cut transmission of the virus by up to 75%. If people who are walking around asymptomatic have a mask on they are much much less likely to infect other people. The suggestion that masks don't protect you from getting a virus is a red herring argument. Yea they don't do very well at protecting the person wearing the mask, but they do quite well at helping to protect other people from you. If everybody wears them then everyone is much safer. The most depressing thing I saw today was a couple not wearing a mask and on the block directly behind them was the temporary morgue trailer of the hospital filled with the bodies of COVID victims.Edited: 6:30 pm, May 21, 2020 "

"I thought the third link in post 1419 was particularly helpful because it gives good practical advice for those individuals who really should be wearing masks for their own protection because of underlying health problems like asthma and COPD. Let’s face it, even if they stay home as much as possible there will be occasions that they will have to leave their home, even if it is just for an assessment with the physician who normally monitors their health problems.IMO, some of the current mindset, that wearing a mask to protect yourself doesn’t help, was triggered early on, both in the US and Canada, because there was such a shortage of masks while the number of cases out in the community was thought to be low; at that time it was felt that the risk to the average person out in public was low so individuals were encouraged to NOT wear masks in order to prevent mask hoarding by the public, similar to what was seen with toilet paper, in order to make available as many masks as possible for the service providers who needed them. Often we were told that wearing a mask actually increased our risk, because we would become less vigilant and less likely to use the other preventative measures of social distancing along with frequent proper handwashing.As it became obvious that the number of cases in the community was higher than previously thought, and that many cases were actually asymptomatic, the message started to shift towards encouraging everyone to wear a mask. Aside from the issue that the pandemic was promoted as a hoax in some circles—which hasn’t helped—I believe the mixed messaging has confused many people who genuinely want to do the right thing. If these individuals had been told to wear home made masks, or bandannas, from the start there might be less resistance at this time.This is an unprecedented event in our collective lives, and mistakes were made by those who we thought should have known better. As they learn more, we need to learn from them, in order to keep each other, and in the long run ourselves as well as those we love, safe and well.Edit: I plan on wearing a mask to protect others and I hope others will wear a mask so that my family stays well.Edited: 8:29 pm, May 21, 2020 "

"Its important for people to understand that the CDC, Mayo Clinic, Dr. Fauci and many if not all state departments of health support public mask use. Also, this is a new virus and as such there are ongoing studies, so when people post articles from several weeks ago a lot can have changed by then as scientists and doctors learn more about the virus. Finally, I have seen the claim before about how the virus can come into the eyes. The reason this is not a relevant argument is because the virus does NOT come OUT of the eyes. The point of wearing masks is for people not to spread the virus and that is done by covering the mouth and nose where the virus is expelled from since its respiratory in nature. Therefore if other people are wearing masks its much much less likely that someone would get the virus through their eyes to begin with. Some people have stated on here they won't ever change their mind. So it doesn't matter what the science says, instead they go on and on about fake sources or whatever. They can believe whatever they want it doesn't make it true. There are also still people out there who are convinced the earth is flat after all."

Good for you. Do you want an award?
"“I wear a mask to protect others and glasses to protect my eyes.”I also wear glasses, this predates COVID-19, and like others I found that my glasses would fog up, which was particularly annoying when I was shopping. I have now started using a paper clip to help with this annoyance! Before leaving home I straighten out a small paper clip and tape it, using good quality clear shipping tape, to the inside of my mask along the top edge of the mask. When I put the mask on, I push on the paper clip wire so that it fits snugly against my nasal bridge, which in turn stops my breath from escaping through the top of my mask, and that actually helps decrease the amount of fogging on my glasses!I use cheaper quality paper clips because the wire is thinner and bends easily, but a piece of any fine gauge wire should work. I’ve even thought of taping a twist tie to the inside of my mask but I haven’t tried that yet. I did find that regular scotch tape didn’t adhere well but clear shipping tape does; a thin strip of duct tape might work too. The shipping tape is actually a bit too wide so I cut it in half, lengthwise, and use only one piece. If you decide to try this, make sure that the piece of tape is long enough to cover the ends of the paper clip, or wire, so that they don’t rub on your face, another reason to use finer gauge paper clips or wire. Remember to remove the wire before washing the mask and make sure it’s dry before using it again :)"

Meanwhile north carolina had its highest number of new cases of the virus to date today. I hope this woman isn't planning on coming back to NYC anytime soon. https:/…
"North Carolina didnt fully reopen yet, although they had a recent spike. However, Georgia FULLY reopened and seeing no spikes. Therefore stay at home orders could actually be causing spikes,OR the majority of these case spikes are coming from nursing homes. I know in NJ, HALF the deaths came directly from nursing homes. You need to focus on the actual cause of certain spikes and contain them, rather than just lockdown the entire state. You quarantine the sick, not the healthy and get the economy rolling again. So many families will be losing their homes and deplete their bank accounts if they cannot get to work again. Many already have lost everything. I saw the stats for NY yesterday and they are SO LOW, that it upsets me that NYC is still not reopening. The stats are proving it is safe now. The Gov is destroying everything. Where will NYC get tourist income from if no one wants to visit anymore after 50-75% of the restaurants are gone?"
Too soon for spikes from the recent openings to be seen. Let’s review after 2-3 weeks
"WRONG. Georgia reopened beginning of May (incubation period is 14 days max). Therefore, not true."
"NT -Georgia reopened the last week of April so its been a month, I am not sure why you think that is not long enough if 14 days is the magic number?"
Since Georgia is inept at reporting data it may be prudent to wait and see https:/…
Georgia’s rolling seven-day average of new daily cases has fallen for three weeks in a row.https:/…
"#145214 days is the “magic number” needs to be used in context. This usually refers to the incubation period, i.e. how long it can take for someone to develop the infection once they have been exposed. If they have not shown symptoms during that time they are considered clear, but we now know that without testing they may in fact be infectious only asymptomatic. Without testing being done on everyone those cases will get missed.An asymptomatic person who is still infected after 14 days can continue to spread the infection to others; that new group of infected people may contain individuals who themselves have mild cases and escape attention, or those who get quite sick and become a statistic by being tested or admitted to hospital. Just because they’re not showing up yet, doesn’t mean they won’t in another week or two. If you recall, it appears that those who require hospitalization because of COVID-19 usually don’t need it right away; their symptoms may be mild initially, build up over 7-10 days, and when they start feeling weak, short of breath, etc that’s when they show up in hospital. A better time frame for assessing the success of reopening, without an immediate uptake being seen, and in the absence of random testing of “healthy” people, will actually be 3-4 weeks at least.Georgia’s Department of Public Health website, https:/…covid-19-daily-status-report , doesn’t show the timing of their tests, so they may not be doing any random testing currently and only test those who show up in hospital for confirmation. I do hope—for everyone’s sake—that there will not be a resurgence of cases, but I do think it’s too early to say that the re-opening has been successful.#1454Again, that “decreasing” rolling seven-day average may be a reflection of decreased testing being carried out and not a true decrease in cases. Georgia doesn’t appear to report anywhere how many tests have been done on a daily basis in the last month compared to before the re-opening."
"""WRONG. Georgia reopened beginning of May (incubation period is 14 days max). Therefore, not true."" As was already mentioned the data reporting from the state government in Georgia has been called into question. In general the incubation period is up to 14 days although there have been studies where incubation periods have lasted up to 24 days, so 14 is not the max. This is only the incubation period. People don't suddenly go to the hospital and report symptoms upon onset. It can take up to a month before people seek medical attention (if it gets to that point). On top of that the data for Georgia that we are seeing now is from two weeks ago, so yes its still too early to know how the reopening worked out for Georgia given these factors.In addition, Georgia can be quite rural so what they do in Georgia is not necessarily something NYC should just copy. We have 197k cases in NYC in a dense urban area. Not the same thing. Rural parts of new york state are already opening up because it is safe for them to do so. https://www.businessinsider.com/reopening-ge…Edited: 5:06 pm, May 24, 2020 "

"Correct Springerandy. Also, NY has some very rural parts just like Georgia. Furthermore, GA has large cities (i.e. Atlanta). Georgia has been opened for about 25 days already (well past the max incubation period). For ANY state, at least HALF the severe cases from COVID are in nursing homes and long term care facilities. Yes, it is well past time to reopen fully. If there is a spike in certain neighborhoods, then I understand closing things down in certain neighborhoods or particular businesses. But they cannot keep everything locked down forever. Its getting ridiculous at this point.

"“ For ANY state, at least HALF the severe cases from COVID are in nursing homes and long term care facilities.While that may be true, and I have no reason to not believe that considering 80% of COVID-19 deaths in Canada have been in nursing homes, two important points should be kept in mind when advocating to reopen fully:1. The majority of seniors across the US are not living “in nursing homes and long term care facilities” so there is a large part of that group that will be at increased risk of getting sick and dying if everything opens up again. They already sacrificed a lot in their lifetime so that we could have the lifestyles that we now enjoy. How we treat them now will serve as an example to younger generations of how they should treat us down the road. In addition, one of the main reasons that I hear expressed as to why a single payer health care system is not welcome by many is that the elderly will be euthanized in order to cut costs (not true imo)! However, it seems to me that in fact the countries with universal coverage are the ones that are trying hardest to protect those same seniors that live among us in our communities, regardless of the sacrifices we need to make. This was witnessed in countries like Italy, Spain, ... and I see it happening in Canada as well.2. Apart from the fact that nursing homes are filled with vulnerable individuals, they’re also a form of a mini-community that includes relatively young staff, and that younger group of individuals have also shown a greater risk of getting sick with many dying. This should make all of us stop and think what would have happened if measures that were taken to distance people in our communities had not taken place: most likely there would have been the same widespread devastation that took place in our nursing homes."
""". But they cannot keep everything locked down forever."" nobody is or ever was talking about keeping everything locked down forever. The only person I have ever seen suggest such a thing was Trump. They are looking at opening NYC in the first two weeks of June. The idea is not to open prematurely and end up with an outbreak and being in the same exact position we were at when it started.Edited: 8:06 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"#1459Thank you for posting those results!Some statements in that article need further clarification before anyone can judge their true significance:1. “668 new cases of the coronavirus [reported] Sunday afternoon, bringing the cumulative total to 42,838.” => That actually represents a 1.7 % increase in cases. It doesn’t say over what time frame, so for all we know that could have been over a period of just a day or two.2. “The number of currently hospitalized patients continues to fall. On Tuesday, 986 current hospitalizations marked the lowest number of COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized since hospitals started reporting data to the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency on April 8. Those record lows changed to 959 on Wednesday, 919 on Thursday, 889 on Friday and 848 since Saturday.” => For these numbers to be meaningful they need to indicate when these people were admitted to hospital; this trend may just reflect the gradual health improvement in patients that were infected before the re-opening occurred and the fact that there weren’t relatively new cases being admitted (the later reflecting that the shutdown was helping!)3. “cumulative hospitalizations increased by 28 from Saturday to Sunday afternoon.” So 28 people were sick enough to be admitted in ONE day => Isn’t that a reflection that there are more cases popping up in the community and shouldn’t this be a cause for concern?4. “As of 1 p.m. Sunday, there have been 481,954 tests completed, an increase of 28,417 since Saturday. Approximately 8.9 percent of molecular and serological tests statewide have come back positive overall.” => Only molecular tests are accurate for diagnosing new cases, how many of the 28,417 were molecular type tests? Without that information, this actually doesn’t tell us anything about what is going on, one way or another. If they were all serological tests, what breakdown of antibody type was found? If they were overwhelmingly IgG type then these individuals are actually not recent cases but fully recovered cases that were infected more than 6 weeks ago. That figure of 28,417 may look good on paper, or in a article, but only to those who don’t understand what they’re reading, imho. But then again what do I know?"
"#1463That phrase has been used by him to scare people i.e. He’s insinuating that those who favour/introduce a lockdown are not planning to open up again, where in reality their plan is to open up once it’s safe to do so."
"#1464: Your comment would carry more weight with me if you refrained from telling me how to judge something. I assume I am included in ""anyone"". At any rate, Georgia's numbers do not reflect the doomsday projections made when their reopening occurred at the end of April."
"I don’t believe I have the right to tell anyone what to think or believe. I do try to explain why I think or believe the way I do, but if after reading my comments someone disagrees with my statements or my interpretations I have no quarrel with that at all. When push comes to shove, I have no crystal ball that allows me to see into the future any better than any one else! As I’ve indicated before, I would welcome a situation where re-opening communities quickly doesn’t lead to a resurgence in cases; that would give me hope that the same could happen in my own city! If it will make you feel better I have no problem changing that statement to, “Some statements in that article would need further clarification before “I” can judge their true significance.”"

"Lisa you are equating taking people to task for not caring in the least whether they spread the virus to other completely innocent people not in their own family ( and frankly I saw interviews where people didn’t even care about that) to somehow trying to control them and narc on them. That is a false equivalence. You are saying that you don’t care because you protect yourself. But grocery workers and delivery people and wait staff and others not in the medical field are wearing the same masks most people in the general public are wearing, not the PPE the medical staff get. So they also are relying on other people to be considerate. And people are not doing it. They have pretty much shown that they can’t be left to their own devices. The governor of North Dakota had to ask people in his own state to not shame people who choose to wear masks, how insane is that?"

"#1502 The press release I heard quoted on NY1 barely an hour ago said the woman had been placed on administrative leave, not that she had been fired. Maybe they decided to instead fire her since I saw that.Also, I heard the dog had been taken to a shelter, not that it had been permanently relinquished. In NYC, to take an animal away from someone who doesn't want to voluntarily give it up they usually have to go to court and that can be a long process during which animal cannot be put up for adoption. I know this because I used to foster cats for ASPCA andsome fosters were indefinite because they didn't know how long court case would take. Sometimes animals are taken to shelters to check on their health, let owner cool off, etc, but are returned without court action. Am not suggesting woman should get dog back -- looked like it was choking -- but wouldn't be surprised if that happened.I thought one of the most disappointing things on this was the suspicious comments I saw on TV by Police Commish Shea.Edited: 3:58 pm, May 26, 2020 "

N95 masks are common for people that work with dust, construction, painting, etc. And how effective are these N95 and surgical masks against viruses:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16490606/"
">>>>> From your 2006 reference:“Conclusion: The N95 filtering face piece respirators may not provide the expected protection level against small virions. Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm. It should be noted that the surgical masks are primarily designed to protect the environment from the wearer, whereas the respirators are supposed to protect the wearer from the environment.”>>>>> My interpretation and application in today’s world:1. Surgical masks are primarily designed to protect the “patient” from the “doctor/surgeon” which is analogous to what is being asked of the average person today when they go out, and can’t remain socially distanced from others who are not part of their “bubble” group. Therefore, surgical masks should be worn by YOU when out in public to protect OTHERS, not yourself! Since there is a shortage of surgical masks, wear a cloth face covering per the CDC advice below. If everyone wears a face covering simultaneously, the rate at which the infection spreads may not be stopped 100% but it will be decreased, making it easier to reach the goal of Ro.2. Respirators (N95 masks) are supposed to protect the doctor/nurse from becoming infected when treating infectious patients. They may not be 100% effective, but they’re the best option available currently for any medical professional providing certain types of care that exposes them to “aerosolized infectious agents”.Getting back to the driver of that car, unless he was in the process of intubating or suctioning someone while driving his car, he didn’t need to be wearing an N95 mask.|||#1544 “When people started wearing masks, they used what they had. N95 masks are common for people that work with dust, construction, painting, etc.”=> True, and since those N95 masks are notoriously uncomfortable, people are less likely to wear them, even if they have one, and instead continue to complain about how uncomfortable they feel when they “wear a mask” rather than follow the current advice* of the CDC to wear a cloth mask. In fact, not only are N95 masks uncomfortable to wear, “N95 respirators may make breathing more difficult and lead to increased breathing and heart rates. Individuals with heart and respiratory conditions should check with their doctor before wearing an N95 respirator.” https:/…N95-Respirators-FAQs.aspx *CDC advice: https:/…diy-cloth-face-coverings.html and https:/…cloth-face-cover.html"

"An example of good, gracious & generous behavior on your part, Northern Traveler!"
Why the purely political posts aren't removed here is beyond me.Sorry to upset the snowflake by questioning a slanted reporter. Most folks on both sides understand who is slanted towards or away from their viewpoints.
"You did it to yourself.And attempts to degrade people by calling them a woman’s name is a bad look, even for you."
"Man, I go out walking and miss all the drama...."
1558 - I missed it too. More of the same?
"100,000 people have died from covid in the US as of today (that is more than Spain and Italy death count combined) with the numbers going up. What does Trump do today? He retweets Lou Dobbs from Fox News who is calling Trump arguably the greatest president in history. An absolute disgrace."
1563 - So we're winning and can declare victory?
Tough crowd ter.

"I love Lou Dobbs.And frankly, that 100,000 number is grossly inflated. How many of those 93 and 100 year old Covid deaths would have died of natural causes during the same period of time anyway?"
What were Michigan residents doing rioting in Minnesota? THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
"“Have you looked at the per capital numbers? The US is well below both Spain and Italy in both mortality ratio and deaths/per 100K”While above may be factually correct at this time, it’ll be interesting to see how those numbers compare by the end of July. If one thinks about the US per capita numbers back in March—two months ago when the majority of the deaths were occurring in Spain and Italy—given that those three countries are at different points in their outbreaks today, the US figures will surely rise at a greater rate over the next two months."

"***I love Lou Dobbs.And frankly, that 100,000 number is grossly inflated. How many of those 93 and 100 year old Covid deaths would have died of natural causes during the same period of time anyway?***Yeah, Lou Dobbs fan here as well. But I thought you were better than that Lisa, LOL. Oh sorry, that was Breitbart. As far as numbers go, yeah, there is a lot of controversy out there in regards to inflated numbers. What I find interesting is that if you look at the NYC daily death summary, it's very clear that the vast majority dying with Covid had some underlying health condition. In the link below, it's up to May 16, the total deaths are 15,888. Of the total deaths, 96 are reported as No Underlying Conditions. https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pd…"
"True, Andy, but I have underlying conditions according to those guidelines. So does anyone who is:Over 60OverweightDiabeticHeart ConditionEtcetcetcAnd most of those folks (and me) can expect to live another many years. But if COVID gets you and you have one of those conditions, you are in deep trouble. So yeah, we're all gonna die anyway, but if we don't get COVID, we can expect to live much much longer"
"Thank you, Northern Traveler. To hear thousands of deaths dismissed because “oh, well, they had an underlying condition” just stuns me. I’m not sure where Springerandy lives, but around me I (still!) see giant refrigerator trucks parked outside of funeral homes to handle the overflow of bodies; a stream of funeral cars entering Green-Wood Cemetery (I used to see a few per week, for a while it was 3-4 every day); constant smoke from the crematorium. This is not normal mortality (as the data clearly show). This is a mass casualty event, and to say otherwise is very bad behavior. You can debate the *implications* of that (what should open when, with what precautions), and I might surprise you by actually agreeing with you on some points, but to deny the magnitude of the pandemic itself is...well, I spent enough time on this post to not want it deleted, so I won’t say."
"I don't know if they do this in other counties, but I like the hyper-local infection map in Nassau County. I can watch to see if new cases are slowing (which they are). I can also check and see if there is a spike over the next two weeks because of all the partiers on Memorial Day weekend. There's plenty of testing site available, so this should prove to be a fairly good overview of how seriously we need to take social distancing outdoors. Big jump? Serious. A few new cases? Not serious.https:/…3545ec3d3a3e4ac1babe7d4714fedb56Edited: 12:47 am, May 29, 2020 "
"***Thank you, Northern Traveler. To hear thousands of deaths dismissed because “oh, well, they had an underlying condition” just stuns me.***Of course it does Linda. However, where did I say that I dismissed those deaths? I did not use the phrase ""oh, well"", so please do not put words into my mouth. All I did was to provide statistics that show a trend. ***but to deny the magnitude of the pandemic itself is...well***Oh no, the pandemic is quite real. But the data for the NYC death count shows that the vast majority of people dying have other health related issues, that's a fact."
"***I (still!) see giant refrigerator trucks parked outside of funeral homes to handle the overflow of bodies; a stream of funeral cars***That's because DiBlasio and Cuomo killed thousands by not properly utilizing the resources they were provided such as the Comfort, the Javits Center and the $21 Million field hospital in ... wait for it ....

"I don’t care if people have underlying conditions or not, it doesn’t make their deaths somehow more palatable. And plenty of people without underlying conditions have either died or are looking at some long-term health issues. And for the record, I was not ‘whining’ about missing the drama, nor do I report posts for anything other than self-promotion/advertising. BTW, Illinois is the only state that actually met the national guidelines for reopening that were issued by the current administration. Until someone started tweeting about liberating states, because he was watching hosts on Fox."

"DiBlasio and Cuomo didn't kill thousands by failing to properly use the Comfort and the Javits Center. They didn't use those places because in the end they apparently had enough space in hospitals. In other words,somebody over-estimated their possible need for beds and/or the skill sets of those facilities. I don't believe the Comfort was ever intended for COVID patients. Its specialty is apparently combat wounds, so they intended to use it for normal gunshot sounds, stabbings, etc, but those didn't materialize in a much quieter city. The Javits Center was intended for people w/milder COVID symptoms, and though they had some of those, it was not in numbers expected. But neither facility was prepared for seriously ill COVID patients.If any of those deaths are their responsibility, it is more likely because they were not prepared and acted too late. It is possible they were waiting for the federal government to provide some guidance/leadership, but if there is one thing local and state officials have learned from this catastrophe it's that you can't count on the federal government for leadership. I think one smart thing Cuomo did was set up that consortium with 6 other eastern states to acquire, store and share supplies. I suspect this will come in handy in future disasters when the national government fails.."
Some people can't be trusted with children apparently.https:/…
"1570:""given that those three countries are at different points in their outbreaks today, the US figures will surely rise at a greater rate over the next two months""""Surely""? Conjecture hasn't turned out well for scientific models so I am assuming it will not go well for someone doing the same on TA."
"Darwin was right again, Red"
#1586:Cuomo is pretty much getting a pass from the national media for the state nursing home fiasco (3000-5000 deaths depending on the source) and takes no accountability if he is dared to be questioned about it in Albany. He hasn't shied away from acting without the federal government so I am not buying the lack of a federal response or that he just following the federal government's lead (I seen both used) as excuses for these or other deaths where his actions have been called into question.
"QQ2,I can't believe you are defending the total mismanagement of hospital resources and Covid-19 patients vs. placing INFECTED COVID PATIENTS INTO NURSING HOMES! Cuomo even just had the nursing home order scrubbed from the website. My friend's Dad who had kidney problems was shipped off to NH and died allegedly of Covid. No excuses, Cuomo needs to be held accountable."
He was likely going to die anyway. Or so I read here.
"rjrGreat points. Some people don't get the point that those people would have had another 10 years or more if not for Cuomo's despicable, careless handling of our elderly. Yeah, we're all gonna die one day. But it doesn't have to be today because of idiotic bureaucracy."
"#1590 I realize Cuomo is getting a pass but if the federal government had taken the lead on this, hadn't shut up that doctor at the CDC who tried to get the word out (Messonier, the one who finally went against orders & had conference call w/press in late Feb that made clear what we faced; I couldn't believe my ears) and simply ordered states to take action a couple weeks before most of them did (not to mention help coordinate provisioning by professionals instead of by president's son in law and his frat bros) many lives could have been saved. I have read that starting the lockdown just a week or so earlier in NYC could have saved 50% of the fatalities here. It really would have helped if the pres, instead of denying advice of his own experts, denying there was a problem & obsessing over his ratings could have ordered everyone to prepare.To be honest, I was slowly stocking up on supplies in early-mid Feb based on what I had been reading in the NY Times since early Jan.I also think it's important to watch out for the attitude that ""it's just a bunch of old nursing home people who should have died a long time ago/were costing us too much/got more than their fare share of real estate gains,"" etc., etc.Everyone's life has value, and from what I have heard this is an awful death full of suffering you wouldn't wish on any sentient being. And a lot of the older victims were not ""nursing home people"" on the verge of death. They were active people living in their own homes and contributing to their communities and families. Then there is a huge group in the middle (that is, between the asymptomatic 20-somethings and the nursing home crowd). These are people, often in 30s to 60s, who survived but who had very serious cases with long hospital stays and may have suffered life-altering after-effects that will change their lives forever -- possibly requiring, in addition to major lifestyle changes, ongoing medical monitoring & care/expense, rehabilitation, career changes or disability benefits, organ transplants and who knows what else. Personally, I would like to avoid having anything to do with any of that stuff. I am not a wealthy person and know there are not enough insurance benefits on earth to cover those types of largely post-hospital expenses."
"#1594Yes, 100%!"
I forgot to say “Thank You”
"*** I have read that starting the lockdown just a week or so earlier in NYC could have saved 50% of the fatalities here.

But why blame the president, DeBlasio or Cuomo could have shut things down earlier, that decision was up to them. You mentioned that you were planning in early-mid February, that's good, you were proactive. Maybe the mayor and governor should have been more proactive. Everybody is quick to blame the president, mostly because they simply don't like him. Did Trump do everything right, no. But what leader could have handled a pandemic perfectly, the answer is no one. Anyone in that situation is bound to make mistakes."
"No, we are not going to let deblasio take out a 30 year loan and let him spend it however he wants to. The last person I trust with money is deblasio. There needs to be significant oversight given his track record. https:/…"
"You know what, I agree, no one would have handled things perfectly, and anyone would have made mistakes. But the current occupant of the White House will insist that he handled everything ‘perfectly’ , as he never makes mistakes. Just like he has never had to ask God for forgiveness. Just like his gut feelings are always right, never wrong."
"Trump retweeted an article arguing that the mandated use of face masks to control the spread of the coronavirus represents a ""culture of silence, slavery, and social death.""I can't imagine any other president behaving this way but don't worry Trump apologists will defend this behavior too. https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-shares…"

Unless YOU did post on this thread how potus took no responsibility and YOU did criticize potus. Did you? I would appreciate you giving me the post # where you did as I have a golf game soon and do not have time to check. This is my 1st golf game in 3 months, looking forward to it.If you did not post a criticism of potus for taking no responsibility, for avoiding questions about his lack of responsibility and for giving himself only a 10, well I must say that is an example of bad behavior.

"@1637 RJR is not suggesting that Trump should be excused for his conduct. Simply that Cuomo should acknowledge his failures. I wouldn't say Cuomo is getting a pass since I have seen significant coverage of this story in the media. He claims to have followed the CDC guidelines and that nursing homes could turn away people if they could not take care of them safely. Those claims should be investigated to see if that is all true. I find his explanations a bit lacking. The policy did not make sense and why were these issues not raised if that was the CDC guidance? The least he could do is acknowledge the pain of the families who lost loved ones and that it was a mistake. I understand the republicans are looking to score political points with their investigations and if that was actually the CDC guidance its quite lame of them to do so, but still there should be an nonpartisian investigation to determine what went wrong and why and how to prevent it from ever happening again. If Cuomo did indeed make mistakes he should fully acknowledge them. We all know that Trump will never do so, because he refuses to accept responsibility for anything. That does not mean we need other politicians to behave in the same way, because that is not what leadership is."
"Seriously if you don't live in NYC go and protest in your own towns. We don't need crap like this here. White supremacists, Antifa, anarchists whatever. Don't come to our community with this garbage. https:/…"
"Thank you red. It should also be noted that that terrible nursing home policy was recently removed by the governor so at least no patients will die because of it and no more families will thus have to suffer. I do credit Cuomo for that.Edited: 4:43 pm, May 30, 2020 "
"1639 There is much blame to be assigned, I never wrote there was not nor excused any responsible party for their failures. When individuals post attacks on a member of a party they do not agree with and when the basis of that attack can be applied as well to a member of a party they agree with (and to a much higher degree in this case) I will call out that hypocrisy. Which is exactly what the poster who criticized the governor did. I asked the poster to show me the posts in which they criticized potus for the same behavior, for much worse behavior. The poster has replied since then but exactly like their idol...avoided answering the question, because they did not criticize dear leader previously.Disagreements and discussions with responsible parties is not a negative. When posters only want to advance their agenda and overlook everything done by those they favor, that is not responsible that is hypocrisy. It was nice to see the poster fault their idol but that acknowledgement should have preceded their comments on the governor not be typed only after they admitted it only to further an attack on one they do not like."
"@1642 I understand what you are saying but RJR never claimed Trump does not engage in the same behavior.Looking at what is stated it is implicit that RJR acknowledges that same behavior in trump and does not support it. People don't need to explicitly condemn everyone who engages in that conduct in every single post, especially when speaking about specific issues or conduct. Its when they try to excuse the conduct constantly and then try to call it out on the other side every chance they get. That's not what RJR was doing and I think if you reread their post the distinction will be clearer, because I hear what you are saying I just don't think its the case in this particular circumstance is all."
1642:This is one of the problems with forums like this and social media in general. You know nothing about me yet you glean assumptions about me apparently because I don't completely align with your ideology. I think you would be better served not to harass people who you disagree with and who have not harassed you.
1644:I’m politely asking you to read your own post and then pretend that I wrote it. Thanking you in advance :)
"1644 engaging in conversation is harassment, as is questioning your claims?I need not ask if you understand the term ""snowflake"" LOL2 posts from you and still not providing the post # of your previous criticism of dear leader for his score of 10.0 and ""I take no responsibility"".Sadly, I did not golf today as the course was closed in anticipation of a famous golfer who travels with his own security detail and get this, you and I foot the bill. Wonder how he rates his golf game."

Apparently a number of people arrested in the riots have been connected to white supremacist groups. I watched a live feed from Minn last night and saw a self contained group of three or four white guys systematically setting fires. Their methods were organized and they knew exactly how to maximize the damage and the information coming out now matches up exactly to what I saw. https:/…

"The country is in the middle of a pandemic with protests & riots breaking out across the country. Lets see what words of wisdom the president has put out today via twitter to calm the nation:""Crossing State lines to incite violence is a FEDERAL CRIME! Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done, and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests. Thank you!""- Notice he mad a point of saying liberals? Using the unlimited power of the military against Americans? Oh and he is talking about doing this own and not at the request of state or local officials. He is literally talking about using the military on states run by his perceived political enemies. ""It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don’t lay the blame on others!""- a number of out of state people connected to white supremacy have been arrested, but apparently its all the radical left according to Trump.""Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late, great General Douglas McArthur or great fighter General George Patton. How come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by Liberal Democrats? Get tough and fight (and arrest the bad ones). STRENGTH!""The mayor is trying to calm the public and restore order and this is what the president puts out? Fight? The job of the police is not to fight. Its to restore order and make arrests where appropriate. Not resort to unnecessary violence. ""The professionally managed so-called “protesters” at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble. The @SecretService handled them easily. Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???""- This sounds like a dog whistle to his supporters to show up and attack protesters who are known to be planning to appear tonight at the white house.""have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least. Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action. ""- this tweet was directed at protesters if they hopped the fence at the white house. There is a long history of segregationists siccing their dogs on african americans. Oh and by the way the secret service is a professional law enforcement agency and routinely have fence jumpers and rarely do they hurt the person or use 'ominous weapons' to effect a lawful arrest. ""On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser , who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice!""- A total lie. The DC police were on scene as well as Parks police and this is verified by the secret service.""Much more “disinformation” coming out of CNN, MSDNC, @nytimes and @washingtonpost, by far, than coming out of any foreign country, even combined. Fake News is the Enemy of the People!""- An oldie but a goodie. In a time of crisis Trump attacks the media as 'fake news' and refers to them as the enemy of the people. ""Here we go again. Fake News @CNN is blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. They are sick losers with VERY bad ratings! P.S. Can’t blame China because they need the cash?""- I guess he is upset about the CNN reporting today about how Flynn was cutting deals with Russia re: sanctions imposed by Obama on Russia on Trump's behalf BEFORE Trump was president. Doesn't fit with their narrative that Flynn was framed I guess. https:/…index.htmlIn a time of extreme crisis for the country the above are all from tweets from today alone. The only times he seems capable of saying the right thing is when someone else writes a speech for him and he reads it without changing anything."

"Trump just issued a tweet calling for calm and unity in this difficult time. He said we have to heal as a people and work in a bipartisian manner to address the systemic issues that have caused this nation such pain. Just kidding. His actual tweet is as follows:""The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldn’t do. Should have been used 2 days ago & there would not have been damage & Police Headquarters would not have been taken over & ruined. Great job by the National Guard. No games!"""
They had area behind them they should have reversed and gone around and not attempted to drive through a crowd of people and put lives unnecessarily at risk. That being said it would be nice if AOC also denounced the criminals who were blocking emergency vehicles instead of just attacking the cops. Protesting doesn't involve blocking and attacking emergency vehicles. https:/…
"Kind of funny how this entire thread began with you liberals claiming that not wearing masks and staying 6 ft apart as ""bad behavior"".

"Plenty of blame to go around. There have also been arrests of white supremacists engaged in these criminal acts. There have been arrests of people who are anarchists involved in these acts. Some people are just criminals who use the distraction of protests to commit crimes. None of these groups are liberals. Of course Trump seems more concerned with Antifa per this tweet. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.""What is interesting is ANTIFA isn't a centralized group. Its not really organized at all. Unlike white supremacists hate groups. Strange that even though we have evidence of the involvement of white supremacist organizations being involved that Trump doesn't target those groups Instead everything is liberal this or liberal that, which apparently his supporters are now going to come out and try to push as a narrative, instead of addressing the underlying issues that led to these conditions or trying to calm the situation."
"red259, do you have proof of those arrested and their ties to white supremacist groups? And it sounds like you're justifying antifa, very odd. Oh, by the way, Trump denounced white supremacist groups a long time ago. The hatred and vial that comes from liberals."

@1661 Exactly some people trying to lie to suggest I support ANTIFA or some such nonsense its absurd how dishonest some people are.
"Straight from Trump's national security advisor. There is NO systemic racism in US police forces. Its just a few bad apples.So basically there is no real problem. Just a few bad cops and then they wonder why we are seeing what we are seeing around the country to these levels? Only a completely ignorant person would say such a thing. That doesn't mean all cops are racists or bad people. Its very much the contrary, but the system itself has fundamental problems of racial disparities. Its not a simple solution. Its a very complex problem. Merely removing a few 'bad apples' is something that has been said for decades and that isn't the sole solution, because its not just individuals that are the problem but the system these cops are called to function within. A refusal to even acknowledge these issues in this day of age is rather pathetic given all the evidence. Chris Rock summed up the problem with the 'a few bad apples' argument pretty well: I know being a cop is hard. I know that s$#t’s dangerous. I know it is, okay? But some jobs can’t have bad apples. Some jobs, everybody gotta be good. Like … pilots. Ya know, American Airlines can’t be like, “Most of our pilots like to land. We just got a few bad apples that like to crash into mountains. Please bear with us.”https:/…index.html"
"The proper way to address the country and try to calm the situation (statement of Joe Biden):These last few days have laid bare that we are a nation furious at injustice. Every person of conscience can understand the rawness of the trauma people of color experience in this country, from the daily indignities to the extreme violence, like the horrific killing of George Floyd.Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.I know that there are people all across this country who are suffering tonight. Suffering the loss of a loved one to intolerable circumstances, like the Floyd family, or to the virus that is still gripping our nation. Suffering economic hardships, whether due to COVID-19 or entrenched inequalities in our system. And I know that a grief that dark and deep may at times feel too heavy to bear.I know.And I also know that the only way to bear it is to turn all that anguish to purpose. So tonight, I ask all of America to join me — not in denying our pain or covering it over — but using it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen. I will keep the commitment I made to George’s brother, Philonise, that George will not just be a hashtag. We must and will get to a place where everyone, regardless of race, believes that “to protect and serve” means to protect and serve them. Only by standing together will we rise stronger than before. More equal, more just, more hopeful — and that much closer to our more perfect union.Please stay safe. Please take care of each other.Edited: 4:01 pm, May 31, 2020 "
"Red, every job has ""bad apples"" whether it be cops, teachers, priests, or even your plumber. There will never be a day where you'll be able to say all cops are perfect. Just like you will never be able to say ""I can trust all teachers for my children"". Why? Because the world isn't perfect and never will be. This is another reason why these protests make ZERO sense. First off, they already charged that Minnesota cop with murder. 2nd, there will definitely be another incident like this next year, and the year after that, and so on. Just like when they reopen schools....I am sorry to say that yes, there will be more school shootings no matter how safe they try to make schools....and yes, there will be more COVID cases inside schools after they reopen, no matter how hard they try to prevent it with useless non surgical masks, thermometer checks, etc. My point is, you cannot reach perfection no matter how hard you try. There will always be bad apples and no protest will ever stop that. But my fear, these protests will surely cause a spike in COVID19, not the healthy guy on the boardwalk who didnt wear a mask. BTW, side note...I was out on Rockaway Boardwalk yesterday and I'd say only 25% of people had masks on. Just too hot to wear them. Many cops didnt have them on either or had them draped under their chin. Their main focus was keeping people from swimming due to no lifeguards (yet there were several surfers). Go figure."
"To make a general post: -NO white person has ANY say on how a person of color should handle the disgusting treatment of George Floyd. In fact, do not tell us how to handle any racially driven situation or that there is not a problem. This is bad behavior. You will never know the frequent emotional daily pause we have to endure. A pause to ensure that we are NOT in a situation where our skin color will cause unrest or make a white person uncomfortable.You might NOT agree with our chosen solution/s. But, what you can do; recognize that there is a problem! A problem that can no longer be tolerated.Calling protesters ""liberal"" is trying to make our call for equality - political. Using the term ""liberal"" to identify protesters means you do not want to address the real issue - inequality. Showing your support for inequality.I am sorry but the idea of ""keep communications open"", ""do not fight violence with violence"" , ""thugs"", ""animals"", etc. all usually come from a white person or is politically driven. Where has that gotten us; only to George Floyd! - i.e nowhere. How much longer must we voice our inequality? As our grandparents would say - “Who cyaah hear muss feel!""What is sad is that you have white people complaining about the ""stay at home"" order from Covid-19. That their freedom and rights as Americans are being taken away. Really? I guess the struggle is real. Colored people have been living with limited freedom, rights and opportunity from birth. Generation after generation.ALL white people will still be privileged over colored people when all is done.If you (the white person) want to help in our journey to equality; be our champions. Recognize that there is a problem. If there are doors that we cannot open - assist in opening them. Fight for our cause. How we break racism is by having white people standing with us and standing up for us. We need white allies to break racism.If you are sitting back and letting inequality occur - then you are part of the problem. Unfortunately, we live in a world where most look out for themselves. What benefits them before community.My husband and I where considering a home in another state. It is sad that the first criteria we have to look at; what is the racial make up of that town/area? How would a colored person be accepted in a chosen community?Sad really.We are only fighting for equality which leads to freedom. ""Early in the mornin'Before the sun begins to shineWe're gonna start movin'Towards that separating lineI'm wadin' through muddy watersYou know I got a made up mindAnd I don't mind if I lose any blood on the way to salvationAnd I'll fight with the strength that I got until I die """
"Thanks for that, nycforever...but sorry that you felt the need to write it. I was struck by something in the preceding post, the idea (quoting freely from memory) that “incidents” like the murder of George Floyd will continue to occur. I was ready to respond with outrage (“that’s exactly why people are in streets, to STOP them from continuing”) and then saw it was coupled with a reference to school shootings, which just made me sad. That’s a level of acceptance/fatalism in the face of violence that I just can’t fathom. It honestly seems less like a left/right dichotomy than a philosophical/theological one."

"A friend of mine wrote this. He is one of the kindest and friendliest people I know. He wrote this a few weeks ago before all of this. This is a successful adult man with with multiple degrees including one from Harvard and still this is how he is made to feel in this country:""Will my new phone get me killed?""That was the thought that I had when I discovered that my new phone didn't have a headphone jack. You see, I take long walks 5 days per week as part of my ongoing therapy for a traumatic back injury. I depend, as so many folks do, on listening to my fitness playlist to get me through my workouts. However, I'm not like most folks that I see on my daily peramubulations. I'm a moderately large, bearded, Black man, and I am never allowed to forget that fact. I don't have the luxury of disappearing into the background, or losing myself in a trance while traveling through time and space. I am forced to be hyper-vigilant, to be aware of the threat that I pose simply by existing.Which brings me back to my phone.My old phone was great. It had lots of features, not the least important was a physical headphone jack. Why was that important? So that my high-visibility hot pink headphones could provide a visual signal that I wasn't striding towards you menacingly while ""ignoring your verbal commands."" Clearly anyone wearing my usual workout gear, high vis, fluorescent, *conspicuous*, wasn't fitting a description. These are the subtle yet meaningful ways that folks who look like me, who mass as much as I do, who absorb visible light in a fashion more pronounced than others, navigate our way through this world.And it's why I looked at my new, top-of-the-line, premium phone with concern.You see, when I purchased this phone from a salesman who looked like me, whose skin tone was so similar to mine, in the camaraderie of our exchange, it never occurred to me to inquire whether the security features of this premium device also included protection from the flinch; protection from ""the look;"" protection from the ""are you listening to me"", hand hovering near a holster, jaw tightening, threat-level raising, another #sayhisname moment only a moment away...Is that too much to ask for from any device? I guess so, because the real truth is that those pink headphones were not a bulletproof vest. They weren't Kevlar and ceramic plated body armor. They were an illusory protection at best, because the answer to my question ""Will my new phone get me killed?"" is simple. My phone won't get me killed,My country will."
