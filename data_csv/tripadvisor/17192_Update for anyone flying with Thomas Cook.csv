Hi I am due to fly to Cancun with Thomas Cook Signature this Sunday (3 May) and have just had a call from my independent travel agent. They have confirmed that at the moment there are no restrictions on flying to Cancun and everyone they have there is absolutley fine. My travel agent will ring if there are any changes. She said that this had all been reviewed this morning so is the most up to date information. ThanksAl
"Thanks for that, we fly with Thomas Cook in 3 weeks time, and until someone tells me no I will still be going."
"I am just on hold with Thomas Cook now trying to find out info, we fly in just over 2 weeks time. Thanks for this update though and as soon as i have heard something i will let you all know. I have also contacted my doctor to get there advise ( they will prob jut end up saying ""dont go"" ) BUT nothing's going to ruin our hol which we booked way over a year ago. Thanks again.Cara x"
my parents set off this morning from cancun with thomas cook too. they said they are keeping an eye on things and head office has been advised by WHO and that there are no reports in cancun yet so flights are going ahead as normal.
sorry that should have read set off for cancun this morning. 
" I think I would want to discuss this further with TC as it appears that the info is changing regularly here is a link to confirmed outbreak in pupils from a school trip returning from yucatan. http://www.edmontonsun.com/n Also the 13 cases being investigated in New Zeland are also a school trip returning from yucatan. foud this out from friends who live in NZ it's on their zealand news. We were just about to book but have delayed to see what will happen.Remember the TC will not want to start cancleing until they are forced too by the gov (that always lags behind the reality of any situation), but if you are concerned and have info to prove why, I would want TC to put in writting to me that they have read this info and are still forcing me to go or lose my money, this may prompt a few managers to change their mind! I would also contact your insurers if you are concerned and feal that its to great a risk, as your insurers may agree and offer a refund. I would be concerned and would not take my daughters there at the moment (infact, I checked and my insurers would not cover me to go there until further notice as one has other health issues)."
Thanks Al My parents also fly out next sunday 3rd from Gatwick and she is just trying to get through to Thomas Cook so I will pass your message on.Denise x
Hi thereMy family and I am going to Cancun on the 18th May and are going unless they stop the flights were still going. I won't get refunded by my insurance unless the FCO say not to go. At the moment they are advising against it but not saying DONT go.
it looks like they're stopping the flights from todays. FCO advised against travel to mexico this morning. thomsons have cancelled flights and are flying people home.
According to TC they will not be flying folks out upto and including 30 April. Discussions taking place about subsequent dates as we speak. No doubt those affected will hear in due course from their travel agent or tour operator. 
We're going with TC direct on 12th May. Have been on the phone to them but they are very non-commital at the moment. If FCO stance is still the same as it is currently we've been told we'll be offered a refund or an alternative. This is not going to happen until nearer the time though.
anyone know what their stance is with people there at the moment with them? In terms of getting home and refunds?
"cazamic- You should be able to claim on your insurance now. I would give them a call. The gov cannot tell you not to go, only advise against- that is the strongest advise they can or will issue (they can however, stop you getting back under a closed border order). That is why the package hols have now pulled there flights, they know they have to under this order. What is not clear is how far in advance if todays date you can get a refund for. I would contact you insurance company and get them to fax/email if you can cancle with your given dates."
"It is my understanding that you will only be able to claim on your insurance if your holiday is cancelled and as of now carriers such as Thomson, etc have only cancelled today's flight and they are making a decision on other flights for the next few days/ weeks later today"
"Fragile,I believe you saw this coming several days ago. "
"flipflop_man, your understanding is correct. Insurance companies will not cover cancellation at this stage stating it is down to the travel companies to either offer an alternative holiday or refund. The only time travel insurance will come into play is if the travel company offer neither of these options (which is unlikely) in which case they will cover the legal expenses for you to sue your travel company for breach of contract.TC will currently not let us change our holiday plans without full cancellation charges as we're within 56 days of departure. All we can do is wait and see."
At times like this there is always a lot of misinformation - fragile please note that that is not a dig at you but a general comment. 
"I have just spoken to our Travel Agents as we are due to fly to cancun on 21st July and they have said that at the moment, there is no need to worry but if all flights to cancun are cancelled by the time we go then we will get a full refund. Fingers crossed it wont happen and if it does, it will be that straightforward. "
" It depends on your policy. My insurers will now not let me travel to mexico, I have a medical policy due to an ill child - I have checked - I am covered to STAY but NOT TO GO!!. It is worth checking your policy, but do not take any info given out in a phone call- you must get it in writting(use a fax) before concidering your options- The policies bought with holidays /through TA are unlikely to cover you, but still worth a check. Policies have differencies for all sorts of reasons. It is not a one shoe fits all job!Yes I did see it coming thats why I advised people not to cancle yesterday (and the day before) and to wait until today. I was/am(not now working because of children) a chemist involved clinical research programs for 15yrs and have had the 'joy' of dealing with WHO and MAA as well as FDA in my past life so could anticipate the next steps a little- but what they do even surprises me - the WHO non-travel ban surprises me!! my fear is that this is driven more by todays ecconomics than science!!!"
hi all thomas cook has canceld all flights till the 5th mayand first choice and thompsons are canceling on a day to day basis iv just spoke too first choicescotlandmags
fragileI think I am correct in saying you had yet to book your holiday to Mexico which is why you case is slightly different. They would not cover you as when you enquired the swine flu outbreak had already been announced
"Lastest TC Information is:The following policy decision has been made for passengers travelling to Mexico with Thomas Cook : All outbound Thomas Cook flights up to and including 5th May will be cancelled. They will, however, operate to bring passengers back to the UK who are currently in resort. All passengers travelling up to and including the 5th May can either amend to an alternative destination or cancel with a full refund. Passengers travelling between 6th-31st May are able to amend free of charge to an alternative destination with Thomas Cook, no cancellations will be permitted at this moment in time. "
"fragieUkI had called my insurance and thats what they said, they wont refund unless FCO say NOT to go and they would need it in writing. I booked with Holiday Direct but it's still TC, and they said they would refund or arrange allternative. For me that is reasuring. But I really wanted to go to Cancun. I have worked hard for this holiday and my kids were so excited. Now I keep bursting into tears! Sods law. We have waited so long for this damn holiday, I can't belive it. Anyone know of any other nice places to go as an alternative? I still want to go to the caribbean if possible."
"Hi, where did you get this information from?? we are thinking about changing to Dominican Republic as we were due in Cancun on the 15th May for 2 weeks. So we need to make a decision quick about what we are going to do as we also have a hotel in mind. Thanks very much Cara x"
CaraWho is your question addressed to???
I fly on the 26th I dont want to spend the same amount on another holiday i saved long and hard to go to mexico! At the moment all i want is my money back! what do i do? if i wait till later will they still allow me to change if the situation remains the same or gets slightly better? any help would be appreciated
" Hi yes that is correct but I did ask them what would have happened if I was already booked and they have said the same thing, they could not allow me to take my older girl to mexico at this piont in time, she requires 24hr canulation into her stomach so risks of infections for her are very much higher than for others. But my parents are due to go in 2 weeks, they have contacted their insurance company and due to medical conditions my mum has they are in the same situation as us. They are at this moment waiting for the fax to come through to confirm what they have been told on the phone, before they rebook elsewhere. But they will have to take the excess hit of £75/pp. I now think that as WHO have not put a travel ban in their advice that the UK travel ban will only last about 1 week unless there are more cases coming back from cancun identified in the next few days. It will be hard for UK to maintain the travel advice against the WHO advice. So if it you now do not want to go and are getting a way of changing for £50pp as Thomson seem to be offering then it might be worth taking it. Although, you may end up loosing out if in the end UK keep the travel ban in place.Its hard to know what to do - and I feel sorry for you all. On a possitive note the interviews with those coming off the planes indicate that out there it does not seem to be impacting on anyones holiday so if/when you go it should still be fun."
"caz- barbados is a lovely place to go to, beaches are prob sone of the best in the caribeen. What ages are your family, as that may help some people on here give you some ideas."
"I agree with you fragile on the WHO as they are now saying we are at a turning point and things could go either way - so the next couple of days are crunch timeWe need a lot more information on where any new cases are and their links back to Mexico, if they are indeed linked to Mexico.I hope that the Mexican Government has not tried to hide anything about local cases in the likes of CancunYes the UK has been ahead of the pack on this but that is our way. After all Mr Brown likes to save the world!!!!!!!!!!"
"We have been told by our travel agents that we can change at no further costs (re: administration fee), in a bit of a quandary whether to go to the Excellence Dominican Republic or Crystal Cove Barbados. If anyone got any suggestions feel free"
" The vision of Mr Brown in a superman outfit, nearly made me choke on my lunch!!"
Sorry - Flipflop Man :)
jeeeeeez we're all doomed if gordon is saving the world!
"This is what caribbean warehouse now have on their siteUpdate : Tuesday 28th April, 11:25The following policy decision has been made for passengers travelling to Mexico with Thomas Cook :All outbound Thomas Cook flights up to and including 5th May will be cancelled.

"
It now only states anyone travelling in May....with no dates mentioned
 thats a strange change back from the end of may one give out a few hours ago- I wonder if they now no more about how long the advice against travel is planned to be in place for.
"does anybody know what is happening with thomsons holidays have they cancelled flights after todays were cancelled, im travelling with thomsons on the 20th may from manchester and dont know wether to look for something else now."
GSGPlease expand you comment
Look on thomson site they have a little advert with mexico news on it click on it and it will tell you what is happening
cooljulesThomson are due to make an announcement at 16.00 today
"I'm due to fly out 12th June, no mention of anything past may as of yet so i guess i'm just gonna have to sit and stew for a few days!!Don't mind changing destinations I just don't want to lose my money lol! "
this is odd....I don't have the 11:25 update on the Thomson website I'm looking at. It still ahs the 9.00am one form this morning saying that flights today have been cancelled and a decision will be made later for the 29th.Curious
DionExcellence Punta Cana is a great resort - check out my review and the many pictures attached to itHappy to answer any questions you may haveWe are waiting on more information before we make any moves as we are not due to travel until 12th May.I still have faith that the WHO have more common sense that the FCO and Gordon Superman Brown and hos various batmen
I've got a funny feeling that nobody will be going to Cancun for quite some time.We are meant to be flying on Saturday morning and have now accepted the fact that we won't be going to Cancun!!! Such as shame because we were really looking forward to it!We are now struggling to find other places to visit!Any suggestions welcome!Michelle
We are due to travel on the 15th May with TC also. I am currently pregnant and do not want to travel to Cancun and take the risk at the moment.Carribean warehouse are just offering alternatives at the moment for this date and no promise of a refund unless flights are cancelled. I have also been told by the insurance company with current travel restrictions in place my insurance would be invalid if i flew!
 My moneys is on not before the 23rd May- I thinks thats why TC changed there amendment timeline from the end of may back to 22nd may in their lastest update
"fragileUkMy kids are 17 and 9 which is why the hotel in Cancun was perfect, it suited all ages. Barbados sounds good, anyone know of some nice all inclusive hotels?"
" Hi for the ages of your kids the gap- great for body boarding - nice walk into town (quitish town execpt spring break). We stayed at southern Palms - not all in but did inclue the water sports and had nice 1 bed codos. My parents have changed to escape the gap- next door to the souther palms but a slightly cheeper placeThe gap has some very nice restuarants but they can be quite pricey so it might be worth going to the gap and a least then you can eat in the gap sometimes but do not have to eatout all the time. Green monkeys all around this area.West coast - calmer water great (nice reef just off shore) for snorkeling crystal cove I think is hear and in meant to be quite nice. Some nice small shoping places if your kids are girls South coast- higher waves -and wind good for experienced surfers and windsurfers, not so good if you are not very goood swimmersEast coast- nice views but rough (and quite dangerous seas) nice for a visit but not to stay hear, this is where the plantations are sugar and bananas, also the green monkeys can be found here also"
"My kids are both boys and we are all good swimmers. I will have a look for some all inclusive deals. Not sure whether to get my money back and find my own hol or get Direct holidays to offer something as an alternative, I suppose I could suggest areas. Damn this is so annoying as have insurance, car parking booked. What a nightmere! My once in a lifetime holiday ruined - I am half thinking of just getting my money and waiting till this all calms down and go for a last minute deal and get some savings."
"hi just read new up date.they are unable to control it, it has reached level 4. it is now epidemic.all flights now been cancelled"
where has this been reported?
WHO upgraded to level 4 after yesterday according to their website. It is not an indication of a pandemic until level 6.
hi my news on my computercame up as urgent they also urging british residents that live there to leave mexico also
Just changed destinations..now going to Dominican Republic. Staying at Iberostar Bavaro. Looks lovely and it's not to bad as we were planning on going to DR next year but we will now HOPEFULLY go to Cancun next May instead. So fingers crossed things will be ok. I am still annoyed and upset as i was soo excited about going to Cancun .. But i suppose it's no one's fault. Hope every1 get's sorted soon. xx
