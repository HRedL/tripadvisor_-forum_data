coronavirus?
"Iâ€™m not sure if anyone can say for sure. When we were at Myrtle Beach a couple of weeks ago, they were many, many hotels on the strip that had no vacancy. One thing you have to keep in mind, is that right now they are limiting capacity at many if not most of the hotels."
What city are you trying to visit? When do you plan to visit? Like this weekend most hotels will be sold out if near beaches but inland you could probably still find a room. With Covid going on not so many people are traveling and not all hotels are cleaning like they should. You might want to disinfect your own room.
