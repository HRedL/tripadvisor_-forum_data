"Hi, we are a couple in our 50s, we are looking to stay within a short (30 mins) transfer of Faro airport in September (hopefully), can you help with resort suggestions please.We must have an attractive sandy beach, variety of local small shops, restaurants and bars, but not too busy. Something with some character and if there is a old town” area and harbour this would be perfect.Any suggestions appreciated.Thank you"
"I think Alvor would fit the bill perfectly, apart from being a bit further from the airport than you have specified - maybe 50 minutes. Armação de Pêra is a bit closer to the airport, but probably still a bit more than 30 minutes."
"Olhos D Agua is approx 40 mins from Faro airport. Lovely small resort but still plenty of nightlife but not hussle bussle and noisy . The beach is only a small one but if you walk a few minutes you will find other larger lovely beaches. As PaulV66 suggested Alvor would fit your bill but I would say more than 50 mins from airport depending on when you are going with traffic situation/season. mmm Armacao De Pera, I find that resort too modern and lots of high rise buildings, although it does have an old original part of town. On another note Faro city itself just a cockstride from airport would suffice if you pick the right area, historic old side, marina etc. As regards lovely sandy beaches I'm unsure on that. Perhaps another member can give info."
Thanks I will investigate this
Olhos de Agua sounds great with other beaches a stroll away - Thanks
"Hi Rads,Olhos De Agua is about 30 minutes or thereabouts from Faro airport. It is a nice resort with around 60 bars and restaurants. The main beach in Olhos is quite small, but it has a nice feel to it, as it is fronted by a promenade with fisherman’s huts and their boats that still operate from there. Within easy walking distance you also have the beaches of Maria Luisa, Barranco das Belharucas, and Falésia which is a beautiful long beach stretching almost to the neighbouring resort of Vilamoura.Olhos lies almost midway between Albufeira and Vilamoura, and both these larger resorts can easily be reached by bus or taxi.Olhos has two decent sized supermarkets, a small indoor market and a variety of gift shops. There are plenty of coffee shops where you can enjoy a drink and a homemade cake or snack.The restaurants and bars are mainly on the road that runs across the top of town, or on the one leading down to the beach where there is a small Square and Promenade. If you explore the side roads though you will find a few hidden gems. There are plenty of Portuguese restaurants and several Italian, Indian, a couple of Thai and a Chinese. There are also a couple of English places if you feel that you need a taste of home. I don’t know whether you’ve been to Portugal before, but it’s definitely worth sampling some of their traditional dishes.Olhos has a bus service which is not overly frequent, but is certainly adequate to get around. There are also two taxi ranks. One is on the Car Park at the top of the beach road, and the other is on the main road opposite the Oceanus Hotel."
Alvor is 50 mins from the airport on the toll road .
Alvor would be the best choice even if it is a little further from the airport but is such a lovely place that it is worth it. Graham

A husband and wife `team`who have assisted with the bars and restaurants listings at Albufeira Guide ... well deserved praise .. they go out of there way to help ... long may they continue ..
"Thanks missfox0, algarveaddict and pyrman for your kind words and comments.I’m only too happy to give help and to offer advice about Olhos and the surrounding area if and when I can. When we said goodbye to Olhos in late February, we were already planning our return which was booked for yesterday. Sadly that wasn’t to be, and so stuck in isolation here in Oldham, I like many others look forward to the day when it will be safe for us to travel back, and when these forums will once again be buzzing with questions and comments about the various resorts and the pleasures of visiting the Algarve."
"Try Olhao or Fuzeta which are close to beaches. If you want to go a bit more west and touristy, consider Quarteira or Vilamoura."
"Have you considered Faro itself? It seems to have much of what you're looking for! It has it's walled old town with lots of history, a more modern city centre around a lively marina. Lots of restaurants and bars. In my opinion it is much more charming to be in a 'real' city then any of the more typical holiday resorts in the central Algarve! The only thing is it's beach, Praia de Faro is about 10 minutes away by car, or a short ferry ride from the marina. Here's a good introduction to the city if you're interested: https://wetravelportugal.com/faro-portugal/"
"I would consider Tavira in Eastern Algarve. Transfer only 30 mins away. You can also use public transport to get there by getting taxi/bus into Faro Town centre and getting train to Tavira. Much cheaper and more cultural. Tavira is a traditional town with river running thru it. Very picturesque. Tavira has a great selection of shops, bars and restaurants to suit all tastes. Beach at Ilha de Tavira is 20 min boat ride from harbour area. Very enjoyable journey with views of the salt flats enroute. Beach has sunbeds to rent however if you want, go up the beach for 10/15 mins and you'll get relative solitude. From Tavira, you can get the train east to the border, hop over the gaudiana river by boat and your in Ayamonte, Spain. A nice day trip for some Spanish tapas and wine. I've been going to Tavira for 9yrs now and love it. Check it out.Edited: 1:54 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Thank you so much for this information, it sounds perfect for us.I think we will be booking Olhus in September -assuming the Covid situation has resolved itself by then.Genuinely thankful for your reply.Thansk"
Dear Mike PThanks for your reply but we are after somewhere with a beach we can walk to easily rather than a boat ride away.Appreciate your comments thoughThanks
"Hi AnnieI think Faro would be great for a day visit for us.Olhos for us ticks more boxes, but we will definitely visit Faro too.Thank you"
"BTW The_Rads if you ever decide to stay in Faro City itself have a look at Hotel Eva its lovely, situated directly on the harbour/marina front. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g…"
Can thoroughly recommend Olhos. Stayed last year and no complaints at all.
"Hi bebopyo,A taxi (for up to four) will be about 8 euros to Albufeira, but at weekends and in the evenings, around 10 euros. To Vilamoura it’s just short of 15 euros, rising to about 17 euros at weekends/evenings.The local bus into Albufeira was 2.35 euros each way, but I think this might have increased slightly, earlier this year. I can’t remember the exact amount, but would be by about 5 or 10 euros. To Vilamoura, I think it’s about three and a half euros or thereabouts."
I think Alvor too it is beautiful and lots for you to do and see it is very relaxing and lots lovely beaches and so pretty we go 3 times a year ;-).if you want to know more please ask can recommend apartments even x
"Hello HibbyI would love to hear more about it an certainly any apartment tips would be welcome. So far just been looking at VRBO and AirBnb but in the past have had much better luck with real localsEdited: 12:40 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"Check out Fuseta, East of Faro, it has beaches, a small harbour and a few bars/restaurants. Very quiet."
"Regarding EVA Hotel by the bus station in Faro ... it is now owned by a `quality` group https:/…hotel-evasimilar to the place mentioned earlier ... Velamar, Olhos D`Agua ...https://detailshotels.com/velamar/the individual websites tend to give a better picture of what is available .."
Stay in porta bay hotel in ohlos de agua you wont be dissapointed
"Have you thought of Carvoeiro. It in as a pretty sandy cove with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants. We’ve been going there for several years."
"We have stayed at Olhos, Carvoeiro and Alvor and we are in our 50’s with teens. Any of these places would suit you. They all have nice beaches, restaurants and the areas feel safe and we have always felt the Portuguese people to be very friendly and welcoming. Although Carvoeiro is hillier so may depend on fitness and whether you can cope or be bothered to tackle this in the heat. Wherever you decide have a fabulous time and do carefully check the location of your accommodation on the map as some places might say a particular place but they may be situated on the very outskirts."
Can you please recommend a nice apartment. Thank you
"Have a look at Tavira, not too far from Faro, plenty of character, excellent beaches as you would expect and a lovely laid back vibe."
"Another factor in their favour would be that there have been very few cases of Covid-19 west of Albufeira, or east of Faro... there is now a decent `quicklook` site for accomodation athttps:/…city-beds.phpEdited: 9:31 am, June 03, 2020 "
"Great thread and sorry to hijack but visited Algarve two years ago with my partner and our then 10 month old. We stayed half the hol in a farmhouse b&b near Portimao and the other half in some villa residence in Fuseta. Had anb amazing time but hoping to return in Sep with the toddler who will be 3, a heavily pregnant partner and again want the same vibe the OP is after.Bearing in mind we've already visited the likes of Lagos, Alvor, Tavira, Olhao and Fuseta already, where else should we opt to stay and visit? We've some time booked already in Bordeira so looking for somewhere for the remaining half, ideally between there and the airport."
"hi, could you recommend a 4 or 5 star hotel in alvor. We usually stay in a lovely town house close to old town in albuifera. We love the restaurants and buzz around. I'd like to try alvor in Mid late September if circumstances allow. thanks"
"You could try the Alvor South Beach hotel , its right on the beach and easy walk into town . Personally we always go self catering as there are so many good places to eat in town we dont want to be tied to a hotel . If you do go self catering there are some nice places , you could look at Vila Da Praia apartments , club Alvor Ria and Solrio . All very good quality and easy walk to beach and town centre ."
