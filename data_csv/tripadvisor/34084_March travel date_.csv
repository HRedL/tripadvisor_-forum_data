"I asked something similar but realize September isn’t the best date. If I was to fly to Australia from sf, how likely would international flights open in March? For as many educated guesses as there can be."
"There is no Educated guess! Currently no body can say yes or no.I suggest just ring the Airlines and say will you be flying in March.?September this year, I doubt it will be possible .March is more likely. That said the Australian Government may not allow non Nationals in, till a Vaccine is on the Market and people travelling have had it and can take a test .Good Luck"
"Very true. It is not what is happening within Australia but without that will govern when the international border will reopen. Even if more air routes come back online, if the mandatory 14 days quarantine is not lifted, it will still make for a very awkward holiday. It is not a very black and white situation."
"No one knows. Even those who are ""best educated"" don't know. It will come down to numerous factors. The Federal Government will make a call but States can also make their own decision about opening their borders.My best guess? International travel in to Australia for tourism is high on agenda but health and welfare of our citizens is higher. Don't hold your breath..."
"At this point in time Australia is traveling better than most countries in getting Coronavirus under control and may even eradicate it. Until a vaccine is developed, though, allowing foreign visitors will likely involve a 2 week quarantine. When planning your trip, if you can add those 2 weeks, your chances of success will be high for a March visit.Edited: 10:41 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"A two week quarantine? What will that process involve over there exactly?? Isn’t there a chance I may not need to be quarantined?? Like in the 2 week quarantine what will I be allowed to do and not do? Mind you I hope to be there for a week like 3/6-3/13.Edited: 10:55 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"I’m guessing it will be the same as it is now for all returning citizens, you are escorted from the airport to a hotel (of the governments choice, you don’t get a say) and you are quarantined in the hotel room for 2 weeks and are not allowed to leave. They have armed guards on each floor ensuring no one leaves. They deliver food 3 times a day. They may fine tune it down the track a bit more, there have been a lot of complaints about lack of fresh air and not being able to order food to be delivered. Maybe you’ll get escorted trips to a balcony once a day? It’s not much fun in any case. The only way you’d be able to travel without any kind of quarantining is if you can have some sort of proof of immunity or if the virus is completely wiped out by that point."
"For the record I’ll be a visitor not returning citizen. Also if I can ask you, in March next year, how likely do you think it is I won’t have to quarantine anymore by then? Also how much would a doctors note help if I can’t get a test verifying I’m negative for the virus??Edited: 11:55 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Nobody can tell you what the procedures will be by then, only the procedures that exist now. Currently nobody is interested in a doctor's note, because it is just a snapshot of your status when the doctor did the test. You could still catch the virus any time between that test and arriving in Australia."
How might I be able to provide proof of immunity exactly though?
"You cannot. The medical researchers have not figured that out yet.Edited: 12:26 am, April 16, 2020 "
"On the subject of immunity, this article describes the current state of research into testing.https:/…"
"OPNobody really knows, that lovely President Trumpet less than 3 weeks ago , told the American People that last Sunday it was going to be back to normal. However, even though for years he has been tell us he is sooo smart , he got it wrong. Then early this week he said he would tell the country when lock downs would be over. Within 24 hours he was proven that it is not his call.This is what , I think will happen in Australia . The Government here has been focusing around the 30 September date, this is on many fronts. While they stop people coming into the country, and the states lock down , they have a chance to just about stop it. This will be via three ways. People , will stop infecting each other, then people will recover , and sadly some will die.. Next will be the start up, it will be very different to the shut down, it will take a long time, this will be on many fronts, to restart will not happen over night. Airlines can not be shut today and fully back tomorrow. Travel in Australia will start by States re opening, this many be over many weeks depending on risk factors. I would say that there will only be one major Airline at first. I am predicting that Qantas may only Fly certain Routes and if and that is big If , Jetstar returns they will fly other routes.Then when International starts , it will be New Zealand , because they have been ahead of the game compared to Australia . There will be a shake out of Airlines across the world. Australia will probably place a lot of restriction ,ideally it would be people who are Vaccinated . However , this might not be so as nobody know if or when this will happen. Counties that have been effected the worst, will be the last. So this has UK, Spain, Italy and the USA as the last ones.As far as Quarantine, the self stay did not work ,the Hotel one has even had issues. The current on is being paid for by the State in which the flight lands . This will be all finished very soon , as I think the Government will take a stand shortly. That is nobody can return to Australia after a date.There is nothing wrong with dreaming... yes planning is ok too . However like has happened things can change very quickly. Even in your own country, your Government might not allow you to leave or worst return.Good Luck and just take one day at a time ."
There is no end game yet been announced by the Australian government although 3 different scenarios have been outlined. None great IMO.Until an exit strategy is publicly announced no-one on here can offer more than a guess.
"None of us have a crystal ball to tell you exactly what will be happening in March, we can only guess based on what is currently happening and the narrative from our government. We are consistently told to expect the current measures to be for at least 6 months, and depending on the situation there there may be a slow wind back of measures, but it won’t happen all at once. How long it will take and the order of things we have no idea. We can only guess. My personal thoughts are with the way our government is approaching this is that they will not risk reintroducing this virus back into the country while it is still rampant in other places, and there will be measures in place to mitigate the risks, such as enforced quarantine. And personally a Drs note means squat, you still have plenty of opportunities to pick up the virus between seeing your dr and arriving here. You just have to accept that your holiday may not happen, and no one will be able to confirm or deny this until March."
"It's likely non-Australians will be able to visit Australia in March next year, and it's also probable that you won't have to be quarantined. However, you may have to produce medical evidence that you have been tested within 14 days of your arrival and the test was negative. Or you might be tested on arrival and have to be quarantined until the results of that test come through.Of course I'm speculating. It might be completely the opposite. There may be a reoccurrence of the disease later this year and everything will go back to how it is now."
"From the US? Flights for tourism in March? Based on all I've heard and read from our leaders, I'd say very unlikely. Even it flights are available, until there's an effective treatment readily available to all of our hospitals, or a vaccine that's been rolled out enough, there will (I think) almost certainly be quarantine requirements of two weeks, which would most likely be that you are put in a room and not allowed out for any reason other than to be carted off to hospital until the 2 weeks is up. At the moment, NZ has been starting to talk about creating a nice little bubble for NZ and Australia where we have open borders as though NZ was another State of Australia. That's just an idea at the moment, based on the fact that both Aus and NZ are doing pretty well so far at getting Covid19 under control - we both have a way to go yet, but so far so good. Australian government noted NZ's suggestion on that but has not really commented on the feasibility at this stage. However, it MIGHT be that we start being allowed to move within our own State or Territory, then if that goes OK, open up movement domestically across State or Territory borders, and perhaps back and forth to NZ. I'd be quite surprised if NZ isn't among the first countries Australia reopens borders to, if NZ effectively joins the Australian National Cabinet which coordinates government action in response to the pandemic. NZ already participates in many regulatory committees in Australia so that would not be particularly novel if it is decided that's in both country's interests. For other countries our government will be super super careful before opening the border for any purpose, but especially for non-essential travel. As others have said, whether US Citizens are allowed in, when we start thinking about who comes in and under what conditions, will depend on what's going on in the US. At the moment, the US response is not exactly inspiring confidence that it will get its act together before March 2021."
"No one can say for sure, the science is not far enough along. Atm the Australian government is being very aggressive about suppressing the virus and is imo hinting that international travel will be heavily controlled until there is a vaccine, at which time you will be required to show proof of vaccination and possibly proof of a good response to vaccination. To date the shortest time for the development of a completely new vaccine was 5 years for Ebola. There is a lot of effort going into a vaccine for sars-cov-2, I'll be pleased and surprised if it takes less than a year: but everyone is guessing atm. Book if you like but make sure you have free cancellation..."
"PS proof of immunity would be measured antibody levels, we don't currently know what subset of antibodies to sars-cov-2 is important nor what levels you need for immunity...Free cancellation is your friend!"
