"Arizonans are very hospitable. But, in our current circumstances, tourist destination areas want to discourage people from visiting and perpetuating or facilitating the spread of this virus. And, for sure, some tempers are getting pretty short. So please blame it on the circumstances."
">> By the way I’ve been reading a lot of nasty comments by people in Arizona towards tourists and I’m not impressed with hospitality thus far. [@Jennifer G]That's probably because the ""kind"" messages early on were ignored. Over 90% of the country are under some level of stay-at-home orders. It should be clear to everyone by now that vacation travel is inappropriate at this time. If someone is still asking ""are you open for visitors?"" questions, chances are good that they're going to get a stronger response.There have been a lot of questions asked about future travel and I'm not seeing ""nasty"" responses to those."
"Is Hunt Valley, Maryland welcoming people with open arms right now? Probably not!"

"The Sedona forum is no worse than many others here on TA. In fact, it's one of the more helpful ones. If the hospitality shown doesn't impress you are more than welcome to visit somewhere else.Edited: 4:37 pm, April 19, 2020 "
"@Jennifer G, I have to say that I'm finding your posts and their timing very odd. Do you have a TRAVEL question about Sedona? Or are you just trolling the TA forums looking for ""rude"" posts to complain about?"
"Jennifer G - I am puzzled as to what you considered ""nasty"" in MPT's response. The OP's posted question was a concise 9 words in length...""...will anything be open?"" Mike's response was similarly brief and to the point and he suggested canceling the trip. What is wrong with that? I, too, am a physician and believe in treating all with kindness. BUT, look at the numbers from a professional standpoint. As of Friday, Coconino county (the main county encompassing Sedona) was reporting 292 cases and 26 deaths. Both of the hospitals that cover Sedona (Verde Valley MC and Flagstaff MC) are reporting ICUs busy with SARS-CoV-2 and deaths. FMC's ICU is near capacity and, unlike the East Coast, numbers seem to only be increasing in the West. Why would a responsible poster recommend anyone travel to Sedona, or anywhere else, less than 2 weeks from now? As for current response tone, even after people were ordered to stay home, photographs were published of Sedona's trails being filled with tourists standing shoulder to shoulder; not unlike the pictures that came out today of the beaches in FL. This behavior was putting everybody, including tourists, residents and first responders/front liners, such as you, at risk. It is understandable that it has ""riled up"" residents."
"Please, pretty please, stay home for now! Thank you very much. We would really appreciate it."
Too Early!Come in October.
"I am not a Doctor but I play one on TA.I follow Sky Ranch Lodge on Facebook and they just posted a big sale on their Facebook page yesterday encouraging visits starting May 1.“ Stay in spectacular Sedona, AZ and SAVE!! Stay 2 nights and get a 3rd night FREE for stays May 1st-August 31st! Visit www.skyranchlodge.com for more details! #skyranchlodge #sedona #redrocks #airportmesa #visitsedona #arizona”"
"Sorry...I am not going to sugar coat any part of the ""Stay Home. AZ is closed right now."" message that apparently nobody is clearly understanding. A switch didn't flip and the virus isn't magically gone. Illness & death is real and we are doing what we can here to stop the spread. Please respect that."
I am just passing on what they posted. I am not planning a trip.If a Sedona business is posting this (IT IS) then expect some people to not get it.
My family of 4 has twice canceled our trip to AZ (mid March and late May). There's no way we'd enjoy ourselves with all that's going on. We love AZ. and will return when we all know the 'new normal'. No state in the Union has a firm grip on how the reopening of the country is going to fare. Anyone who says different isn't being realistic. We'll be back in the future!
Yes it appears Sky Ranch Lodge is open for business on May 1st. Seems strange for a town that does not want visitors they are doing this. Maybe the hotel is anticipating the end of many restrictions 4/30 by the AZ Gov.https://www.facebook.com/skyranchlodgeNice picture but I could think of a lot better Pinot's for the price than CA Josh!
Other hotels are stating May 1 as their re-opening date as well... very conflicting information for sure.
"As someone said it is up to the Governor. AZ cases have continued to rise, but no one knows what he will do. To be on the safe side, I would wait until there is a clear message."
