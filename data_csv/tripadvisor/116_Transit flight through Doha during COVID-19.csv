"Hello,I have an airline ticket from the US to Georgia on Qatar Airways. Currently Qatar is closed, who knows what the situation will be in October. I wonder - if I just fly through the Doha airport without leaving it - is it still considered that I enter the country, and I'm a subject to quarantine? Or this doesn't apply to transit passengers?Thank you."
