"Hi all! Hope you are all staying safe. We are planning a trip to Jiuzhaigou in July. Are the park and scenic areas open? Do we need to be a part of a tour group to go in, or can we visit the areas independently?"
"Hello @Georgehu -- Nobody has answered in the last 12 hours. That's because you cannot currently enter China on a tourist visa. This makes you specific question moot. Please see some of the more general discussions about flights into China, visas, quarantine, etc."
"Ah thanks! Many of us are already here and living in China, so was wondering if anyone any any recent experience."
Most of us aren't living in China and don't have any recent experience.
"Ok, thanks! If anyone has any knowledge, would love to hear it. If not, totally all right."
"I was at Jiuzhaigou last November but I have no idea on the regulations now. I only can say, it's so very beautiful there (been there twice, also in October 2016)."
"According to their official website www.jiuzhai.com the park has been open since late March to domestic groups and individual tourists. But not to ""inbound tourists"" (meaning inbound foreigners from outside China). It's not clear how foreign expats who have been living in China are treated. I suggest that you either contact the Jiuzhaigou office directly by WeChat, and failing a response, contact a Chengdu-based travel agent that offers tours to Jiuzhaigou. Make sure that they know your residency status and that you've been in China since X date (your last entry). And your QR code status should be green."
"Now Jiuzhaigou is open. However, it is only open to some people.People living in Sichuan Province and people from epidemic safe areas.Because of the new coronavirus.，Some tourists in high-risk areas are not allowed to enter the park.，"
"Answer from the authority of the JIuzhaigou, the park is only open for people who have a Chinese Identity Card(Shenfenzheng)."
"Yes, only tourist with identity card; can book ticket."
