Does anybody know when this is being reviewed ?
"Last I saw said constantly,But don't hold your breath for Spain."
"The guideline is 200 cases per 100,000 people. Does not matter is no one dies once it goes past 200 any country is put on the list even is no deaths or no one in hospital.Edited: 3:06 pm, August 24, 2020 "
"Simon, I think you'll find it's 20 cases per 100,000 which makes the measures being taken even more ridiculous. Where I live, out of a population of about 65,000 we've had 25 new cases in the last week so we're being monitored very closely. Completely over the top in my opinion especially when the overwhelming majority of new cases are confined to a specific community."
"There were originally some talk of restrictions being lifted once the main holiday season of August was over and all the schools had their kids back. But then the numbers of infections in Spain have just being heading north since the restrictions were put in place. While this is constantly being reviewed as other posters have said, it’s going to be sometime before a travel corridor is back in place, sadly. If any country goes above the 20 per 100,000 they are going on the FCO quarantine list now such as Austria & Croatia. Turkey looks like they’ll be next. Spain unfortunately is still in the higher rate between 150 & 190 per 100,000 so there is a long way to go & the virus rates are mainly within certain communities and locations. Many places the numbers are fine, much better than most areas in the UK but the UK government are applying a universal restriction as their is no guarantee that infected Spanish citizens won’t be moving around internally within the country. Most people are a-symptomatic & it’s only the testing which is revealing these higher numbers, mostly too late after the a-symptomatic have been socially mobile & spreading the virus.Edited: 4:55 pm, August 24, 2020 "
"20 per 100,000 cases is madness. It is only 0.0002% of the population. ""Local"" lockdowns, quarantines and a variety of restrictions on our way of life for such a minute risk.What is lacking is any sense of perspective or proportionality towards covid."
"Thanks , Portugal it is then"
"Enjoy your trip to Portugal. We haven't been there for a few years now, but love holidaying there.Unfortunately Spain for some unknown reason didn't produce any new or updated figures over the weekend. Figures no doubt will be updated in bulk in the future.It seems the ""R"" of transmission is going higher at the moment, so more restrictions by the Spanish Government likely in some areas of Spain. Some news available on link below. Sadly the increase of people critically ill and poorly in intensive care went up be over 100 to 657.Hope you find a great holiday.Link below.https://english.elpais.com/news/society/"
"20 per 100,000 is 0.02%"
"I can't see it happening any time soon until Spain reduces the infection rate.The Spanish Health Ministry has warned that Madrid must take ""drastic measures"" if coronavirus cases continue to rise. The warning comes after the region reported 15,000 new infections in just a weekIn Spain, a total of 46,000 cases have been diagnosed since last Monday"
"LRP .... Its not, it is what Johnny said.Edited: 5:18 am, August 25, 2020 "
"Spains 14 day average 167/100,000 and still rising.Comparison to uk 22/100,000.No likelehood of any changes anytime soon for restrictions and advice or maybe this year.Atb steve"
"Majorca and Ibiza will come off quarantine list first,probably 2nd week in sept.Can't see Benidorm off list until new year at earliest,with being mainland"
"People when going abroad are can usually make up their own mind. How they feel they themselves and how they are able to cope with or in all sorts of situations.It's always nice to hear people have enjoyed their stay in resorts. Anyone wishing to travel is advised to take out full cover insurance. Lately the prices have come down for insurance with certain companies. More insurances are available now. Some have recommended battleface insurance, but there are others, if that one does not suit your needs.Unfortunately because of the high ""R"" rate in Spain, anyone returning or entering other countries within Europe is asked to Quarantine for 14 days. For some this isn't a problem at all. Flights are still available to Spain.Some parts or regions of Madrid are said to have a high rate of 300 per 100,000. Marbella also has a high rate. Murcia has also been mentioned as having a high rate. They seems high compared to the UK which is between 20 and 26 per 100,000.Spain is trying to get their children back to school at the moment,so it doesn't seem that their restrictions on bars will be lifted fully anytime soon."
"Lusty, your maths is perfectly correct. 20 as a percentage of 100000 is only 0.02.Anybody saying otherwise ie 0.0002 is seriously underestimating the figures and misleading people.Thanks Karl"
"Thanks Karl, it certainly was when I went to school and higher education.... to obtain the percentage you divide 20 by 100 000 and multiply by 100.Admittedly a small number but a potentially life threatening illness. Many views on whether lockdown came to late or was enforced too haphazardly- and the rights and wrongs will never be known even when you have the benefit of hindsight. Sad that people are missing their holidays, incredibly sad people are losing their livelihoods.... but devastating for those mourning for family and friends."
"Sorry, it seems to have gone up again multiplying.It's no longer 300/100000 in certain areas of Madrid.Copied from news 24/08/20.""Madrid, where the 14-day infection rate has soared to 366 per 100,000, authorities recommended on Friday that residents in the hardest-hit areas of the capital remained in their homes.Enrique López, a regional official, widened this call on Monday, urging residents to avoid “unnecessary social interactions” as much as possible. “We’re in a very difficult moment – like everywhere in the world – and we have to make sacrifices"""
"Yes Lusty, there is without doubt some dubious arithmetic taking place on TA these days. Thank you for your mathematical insight."
"Yeah it is 0.02%. A typo. Just pressed 0 for too long0.02%. A tiny percentage. Some of you seem to think that justifies lockdowns, quarantines and other harsh measures.Focus on the big points not the decimal points!Edited: 7:18 am, August 25, 2020 "
Me too...... guilty of not multiplying to get the percentage.I am beside myself with embarrassment.Sorry everyone.
"In the UK, the case rate is about 0.2%. Miniscule.The chances of dying from it0.03% in your 20s0.6 % in your 50s9.3% in your 80shttps://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-nor…Risk is clearly overblown snd exaggerated.By all means shield the elderly and vulnerable - if they want house arrest but don't wreck people's lives.A significant number of UK covid deaths in care homes - and about 90% for people withexisting conditions.Think about Higher unemploymentOther health conditions - cancer, organ failure, mental health.Education - schools and uniSocial lives - yes this is important.Some people seem to have a mentality 'I am in a vulnerable group so everyone else must suffer'Or that we should all have disrupted or restricted lives for something that is such a tiny risk."
What makes you think this?
"If the stats were reversed and spain was 22/100k and the uk was 167/100k and growing, there would be barely one person on here who would complain if spain imposed the same restrictions on us, why so many make a case that spain should somehow be treated differently in respect of the current situation is bizarre.Edited: 7:52 am, August 25, 2020 "
A few months ago it was estimated about 7% of UK had had covid at some point.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52837593The death rate is 0.06% of the total populationYou can catch covid without dying or being seriously ill.Yet focus now on covid rate of 0.02%.

"Perhaps those eager to travel to Spain might find it easier to have a look at how many were hospitalised last week.Sometimes it’s easier to look at how the rate of those critically ill and in a very desperate state of health has increased, patients so poorly that they are being admitted to ICU. ICU. Some figures from a few popular destinations. Figures obtained from worldometer chart.Netherlands 41, Italy 65, UK 72, France 399, Spain 658. To some Spain with 658 in ICU might not sound like a lot, but the worry is, that 3 days ago the figure in ICU was 541, quite an increase in number over this weekend. Hospital admissions had also increased."
"President is just speaking right now, they are not considering another lockdown at the moment."
"Thanks for the update Jeny, as I understand it the ICU stats are for people who have tested positive for covid but not necessarily the reason they are in ICU."
"Jeny5 - it is not clear from that website about the timespan of critically ill in hospital. I took it to mean how many now over an an unspecified period. We don't know the age groups or whether there are other health conditions too.For SpainCases 175/100,000Deaths 0.6/100,000Catching covid isn't by any means fatal https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaJamieandSuzanne - interesting. So ICU admissions may not be for covidEdited: 8:27 am, August 25, 2020 "
"Hi Johnny I dare say they had tested positive at some point, much the same way as the deaths are calculated"
"I have been following the figure from charts you have been posting JB. Watching and noting the Critical figure for Spain. Think I did post the 541 figure (or thereabouts) last week, because someone mentioned that there were not that many becoming seriously ill. The reason I noted the figures is because I myself am waiting to travel now the temperatures are coming lower. I am prepared to quarantine for 3 weeks if need be. As you have said several times, there isn’t much open in Spain, so would it be worth it.I am certainly not against travel, but agree, people should quarantine and be respectful of others if that is what is required.However, in view of those being admitted to hospital in Spain, I am now considering changing my bookings to Portugal."
"Well, we don't really know about these ICU stats. Not as clear as cases or deaths.One thing is clear, a very significant difference in cases vs deathsDeaths 0.6 per 100kThat is 0.0006%Check it out!"
"I think it’s right that the Govt reduced the ‘Covid deceased list’ by 5,000 and there will now be a cut-off of 28 days, providing a more accurate picture of the epidemic.As many people can spend weeks at home and then in hospital before respiratory failure develops necessitating ICU, it’s taking cynicism to a different level to suggest the increase in Intensive Care admissions isn’t primarily Covid related. I agree none of us can be absolutely sure of the exact numbers but the case is pretty persuasive towards Covid causation. Countries know the usual and excess number of admissions over any year.Jules"
"I haven't seen any conspiracy theories on here.Just a difference of opinion between those who think the response to covid is disproportionate, the very low deaths rates and others factors to consider versus those who think Society needs to be closed down on basis of minute risk or who think just because they may be in a ""risk"" group everyone's way of life has to change. That's selfish.Look at the stats:Case numbers. TinyDeath ratesm. MinuteAge groups affected. Over 80sNon covid health abandonnedIncrease in mental healthEducation/Exam fiascoJob lossesEtc etc.Whole response has been DISPROPORTIONATE"
"The whole issue isn’t as black and white to me Johnny and selfishness in terms of response cuts both way.The U.K. isn’t on lockdown now save for a few spiking areas. The numbers and deaths were not tiny when lockdown was required. We’ve moved on. With a more robust track and trace system, lockdowns wouldn’t be needed for all in those areas. Whether we like it or not we have to respect how Spain and other countries choose to handle virus control. Our holiday needs have to be secondary but even then we can still travel if we accept the quarantine penalties. Don’t think for one minute I don’t understand or assess the impact of all this. It’s probably affected me more than most and I have a role that gives me daily exposure to people/families who have been casualties of Covid. There’s no need to get shouty with the capitals either thanks. Jules"
"Yes Jules agree some of the theories are ludicrous, not all I might add.There are just too many holes in the whole thing a while back it was like the Dutch boy with his finger in the dyke ( none of you dare!!)now its like he is holding a colander"
"The way things are going in Spain, we'll be lucky to have the travel corridor reinstated this side of Christmas. The government are now going to allow provinces to return to a state of alarm."
"Figures now spiralling. Known fact is that is what this virus does, it multiplies. I don't think many would dispute that fact. The UK is doing well keeping our figures under control and low.Interesting to hear people earlier, say that there were hardly any hospital admissions in Spain. Over 5,000 recent admissions another 700+ more recenty. The article below was from 2 days ago. It may help explain why other countries needed to imposed fourteen day quarantine measures on those people returning from Spain. https:/…1951947"
"I don't understand why UK figures are so low.Our Government is very indecisive at the moment, seems to follow rather than lead, but still achieving results.We as a people are 'it'll be reet' sort of attitude.I expect it to rebound on us eventually, but hope it doesn't."
"Since the start of the pandemic UK has been 2 weeks behind Spain, so I expect the figures to go up in about 2 weeks..."
"Alisha, spain 172/100,000 and growing at quite a rate uk 22.5/100,000.Either spain would have to drop a heap and the uk would have to have phenomenal increases to get close to each other.Dont quite get how you work out the two weeks behind, the responses currently are very different.Atb steve"
"#43 which figures are you assuming will increase? Infections, hospitalizations or deaths?"
