Hi there I 'm from Singapore and will be visiting SF in the coming days . As you know there was a recent Zika outbreak in Singapore . Does anyone know if visitors from Singapore / Zika affected countries will be throughly screened for Zika symptoms or even quarantined at SFO. I am just worried about the possible delays here .Thank youDaniel
This is the latest info on Zika in the US from the Center for Disease Control. There is no mention of incoming travelers being screened.wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-information
"There is no airport screening for zika. That being said, it is always possible that if an arriving traveler appeared to an immigration official to be obviously seriously ill, they could always be detained for an examination. This came up during the SARS epidemic."
"Signs and symptoms of Zika can mimic a large number of ailments and there is no method of rapid detection that would be viable in a setting like an airport.There is no screening. If you are ill, stay home.Dr. Z"
Thanks for reporting the situation !
