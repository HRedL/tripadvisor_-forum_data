"No booze at beach bars ?? It's unamerican! It's outrageous! Oh, well. There's always BYOB."
"Bassman, it was decided to allow the beach bars to open but for take-out only and no alcohol to be served. Sorry, but the no alcohol rule also applies to BYOB!!! But no worries, by the time you return it'll be back to normal - we just don't know when right now!"

"Absolutely, Bassman! They'll be all over (undercover of course) doing personal sampling of containers. Applications are now being taken for those with a particularly high alcohol tolerance!The aim of course is to further discourage the groups which bring containers full of alcohol with them and feel there's no need for them to abide by rules which they deem stupid and in violation of their ""civil liberties"". The ones who initially messed it up for everybody ..."
"Those ""Social""drinkers ruin everything."
