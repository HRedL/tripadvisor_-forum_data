"Hi, Headed back to PV in March for the first time in a few years. Wondering if any folks have noticed if the number of visitors seem to be down this year?"
It seems to be busier than ever this year!
Agree with lesm017 - numbers are up over last year.
It seems to get just a bit busier every year.
"Hope that holds up (for PV business owners and workers) - big segment this morning on national news shows about the impact of Corona virus. Apparently tourism worldwide is expected to take a hit - people unwilling to be crammed into tight spaces (airplanes, cruise ships). We all remember the hit tourism took in PV when there were epidemic scares in the past."
"According to the people at the front desk of Villa Del Palmar in Jan this is the busiest year they have had in several years. Judging by the people on the busses, taxis, in the restaurants, shops, & on the streets, I think I have to agree. My wife & I both came home from P V with miserable colds in early Feb but nothing to do with the corona virus. Safe travels  Life is good"
"Fred T. I didn't think of the corona Virus. That may make some people think twice. Of course, that will affect not only PV, but world wide. I plan to be in PV in the spring and I will be alert, but it would make me think very hard about visiting some of the more under developed countries."
"You can bet that Mexico is not prepared to handle a major outbreak. I'm old enough to remember the chaos in the airport when a number of epidemics rolled through - spacing on the names I think there was a ""bird"" one - maybe a ""pig"" one - one you couldn't even pronounce - chika something. Once the hysteria kicks in (even if not really justifiable) it hits tourism hard."
"Before everyone starts worrying, Mexico has no confirmed cases of corona virus yet. When we left PV a couple weeks ago, we were asked at airport check in if we had been to China in the last 14 days., so it seems they are being proactive."
"Corona virus will effect tourism of PV unless it has many confirmed cases in the area. Well, I should saY maybe Asian tourism will Hold off for a while but that is about it. I’ve heard it’s the busiest February they’ve seen in a long time. Business is good, almost too good for those of us who have been going there for years!"
"I think it's too early to tell if Corona will be an issue. If it takes hold in the US/Canada all bets are off. It's already impacting businesses because it's disrupting the flow of commerce - when Apple catches a cold the US sneezes - lol. China is still the biggest trading partner of the US. What impacts the economy overall, impacts tourism.Edited: 12:50 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"We just returned from a two week visit on Sunday. We go 2-3 times per year and it was probably as busy as we’ve seen it. I don’t think most people are to the point of cancelling pre-scheduled trips, but maybe there will be a down turn in the coming months if things continue to be concerning."
Nope. Higher slightly.
"I read in one of the Mexican publications that ""Overall"" in Mexico tourist numbers were lower than expected. There are NO confirmed cases of Corona Virus in Mexico as yet. There I believe are cases in the USA. The Corona Virus will impact everything if not contained and that looks to be not likely as of now. Mexico I have seen in the last decade to be much more proactive than ever, so I am less worried about their containment than other countries. In the end, I think this will impact tourism, economy and everything worldwide, for some time to come. Influenza alone, yearly kills, more than Coronavirus but the difference is, the scientific community knows about it and has vaccines whereas Coronavirus is new. Just looking at the attitude of many folks around the world in regards to vaccines and better good for all, we could have a very bad situation on our hands. It is scary, but I do not think anyone is cancelling vacations to Mexico yet, though airplanes are just germ holders to me anyway, so it would be a good idea for al to wear masks. I also think at this point we need to remain calm and not proactive and not feed into hysteria. I did tell my husband who flies tomorrow to wear a mask, will he> Not likely! Would I, absolutely."
"More important than the masks, wash your hands! More often than you normally do."
I agree with washing your hands as well that is a given always..ALWAYS! I am a firm believer in masks for anything respiratory as well!
Have you tried buying a mask? As of late? Can't get one. Oh yeah...China makes those! Not even in Home Depot.
"C'mon, Fred. Stick to what you know. Don't know what that might be, but it ain't global economics. Remember a month and a half ago when you were all Chicken Little over Iran? Peso v dollar has barely budged since then, and what miniscule movement there has been had nothing to do with Iran."
"What I know is that Apple is going to miss their first quarter projections due to China supply problems and closed retail stores. That erased $64B from the market already. So, go bury your head in the sand at your own risk. Maybe it doesn't become a big deal but I don't think you can say it won't. I don't think we've heard the last from Iran either. Could either of these issues impact travel? Absolutely they have the potential to. Will they? Who knows?"
Backing Fred on this one. What is your point? Gonna be bad. We are so dependent on China.
Oh my. Here we go. (Again)
"Uh, yeah.Epidemic. Like no other.Have a son in Asia teaching English (year 5).Very concerning."
"Try a pharmacy for a mask and we have plenty here in Mexico.. but we do use them often if someone is sick or even if going into city for air pollution! Economically if this, god forbid, should become an epidemic or pandemic the economic structure will collapse. These are obviously serious issues, but lets keep it in focus now. :)"
Thanks Bezerk. We arrive in a few days. Will buy masks there. Since we can't get them in the states. Not being snarky.
"Should also mention, I'm typically on board with you Kevin. All hogwash!Unfortunately this epidemic is unusual. Hopefully they can get a grip on it."
This issue not sure it is an epidemic as yet is unusual only because scientists do not know about this virus? I am surprised cannot find masks in the states. Now there will be a mad rush in PV for them..LOL
"Appl up 1.5% today, and another half point after hours. Freddy, you were predicting a short term crisis with dll v mxn, recommending that travelers buy their pesos immediately as a hedge. So, what now is your long term prediction, since you've backed off from the short term crash? Which are you buying? And the SSEC is recovering nicely since the outbreak.""Maybe it doesn't become a big deal but I don't think you can say it won't.""Well, that's brilliant."
"I am hearing dollar expected to hit 21 or 22 soon in 2020, who knows with this impending virus but I have a stash of dollars in case. Masks are kind of like tissue around here, maybe I should buy a stock before they all disappear! We are proactive in Mexico for sure!"
"My question had absolutely nothing to do with coronavirus. Just wondering if numbers were down. Maybe one of you folks should start a thread on coronavirus. In the mean time have a margarita a chill out.Edited: 5:49 am, February 20, 2020 "
"I have to agree with Fred. Not because he says so, but I have spent 'some time' watching international economics and it is amazing how many things can affect us and world economy. The Middle East and China always have the potential to bite us in the backside heavily."
"Perry SAmazing how a topic can go sideways quickly. I googled some numbers. All stats show an increase in tourists. Granted PV tourism site’s data is an year old.PV Airport numbers show an continuous increase. Ending with the last quarter 2019. So fairly recent.As for a general feel from people here. We find more crowded than previous years. Lines ups to restaurants start earlier. More folks on the beaches, walking about and even spots that weren’t busy, are busier.BTW still going to have that Margarita."
Cheers!
"Anyone still thinking I was crying wolf prematurely? Fasten your seatbelts - it's going to be a bumpy ride. If it isn't already impacting tourism, it will be. I can't foresee any scenario where the stock market takes the biggest hits ever recorded and it's good for tourism. The only good news is that unless this situation resolves quickly and without to much economic pain - Donald Trump is toast.Edited: 5:44 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Fred T. As much as it hurts me and of course many others I have to admit that you are on the correct track We will just have to see how this plays out, but like you I don't like where it might be going.I bought some gold a year ago and my wife complained at the price. She saw what it had shot up to and now she is asking why I did not buy more."
"According to Mexico News Daily toyrist numbers in general for All of Mexio are down. Now maybe PV is up but PV is just a part of Mexico. Apparently last week was very very busy in PV as expected since it was vacation week for many states in the US. This week, personally resort I am at went from 100% occupany to around 85%. I do not find it any busier than other years here at this time. I did not come to PV last year at this time, I went to Cabo. So who knows but though surely not in the posters question, the corona virus will affect and possibly already has tourism worldwide."
I decided to return to Puerto Vallarta this year because of the Sargasso seaweed in the Myan Riviera for the last few years in March.
"Why do people care about masks? It’s been proven that they don’t do a thing. I’m still planning my vacations next month, really haven’t thought twice about it as they are in the states. Unless I hear not to travel from the CDC I’m not going to worry much."
"We’ve been here about 2 weeks so far, and based on what we’ve observed the numbers don’t appear to be up. Walking the malecon in Old Town many places are not full, even at sunset. During the day a lot of places have chairs and umbrellas open. Of course the popular places mentioned here are pretty full, as are the restaurants that everyone suggests, reservations at those places is a good idea. Maybe the travel going forward will change the numbers, but they don’t look to be up now."
I was there last week for 2 days before heading home and I thought it was more crowded than usual.
"Now that over 8000 people in California are being monitored, I think it is just a matter of time before it is spreading in Mexico. A lot of us who vacation in PV are over 60, the demographic suffering the most severity. We are supposed to leave late next week. I am watching the news closely. We’ll lose money if we cancel as our insurance we have is just for medical evacuation. Must admit beginning to become more concerned. Certainly don’t want to be quarantined anywhere. Wish the leadership in the US would be more trustworthy and organized."
What are you smoking Fred!
"As a medical professional, masks are a very useful device but must be changed frequently. Also keep in mind the regular flu kills thousands every year, but has s vaccine which many do not use. Corona virus is surely going to be nasty. wash your hands and you know if we all wore masks, even those with it would spread it less. No shaking hands either."
@Jim H - and yet. 8000 people being watched in your neck of the woods. They won't be booking any trips to PV in the near future. Dow is down another 600 points after taking the biggest hits in history. I think you must be the one smokin' the whacky tabaccy if you think Mexico tourism isn't going to be impacted by Corona.
If tourism is actually effected by the corona virus I would think it would be next year since most of the tourists have locked their vacation time in this year & like BigB927 are not going worry about it unless there is a real problem.  Hopefully it will pass without new outbreaks & all will be OK Safe travels Life is good.
"It ""will"" have a big impact on tourism, unless you're on a cruise .Does PV have many cruise ships come to port?"
Yes. PV has a quite robust cruise ship port especially during high season.
"The worst place to be would be a cruise. 2 confirmed cases in Mexico, both had traveled to Italy. sigh."
Tounge in cheek. Bet you can get a good deal on a cruise these days?
We travelled in early February from Canada and the flight was half empty (or half full) whichever way you want to look at it.
"32 million cases of the flu resulting in 18,000 deaths so far this year in the U S Infected people traveling to & from foreign destinations, in our stores, malls, restaurants ect 69 confirmed cases of the corona virus in the U S with all of them quarantined to stop the spread of the disease.  Stay calm, wash your hands, & enjoy. Safe travels Life is good"
"My friend got worried by family in USA nd went back today a month early. I gave her a mask to wear on airplane...as i always travel with them, just in case i am seated next to a coughing person. Me and Hubby are staying put...not gonna freak! U S media hype makes people crazy! I have a broken arm from a fall a week ago, & cannot stress enough how wonderful the medical community is here.....i"
"I was wondering if anyone is nervous whilst they are there if President Trump closes the border and you cannot get home, we are traveling with young kids and I am worried, would like others thoughts"
"The border closing plans include the port of entries, not the airports. I am headed to PV next week and am not concerned. I doubt that Trump would do it- he seems to make a lot of idle threats.Edited: 11:32 am, March 02, 2020 "
"As a US Citizen they must allow you to return to the country. You if ? of being sick with Corona would be quarenteened as it should be. I would not change my plans to Mexico, but China and Italy off limits of course. The regular flu as shown kills and sickens more yearly, yet many get no flu vaccines and think nothing of it.Stay calm, wash your hands, if you are coughing wear a mask."
"Thank you, Bezerk!!! We can always count on you for solid advice."
What would keep me at home is worrying about what extreme measures the US current administration might come up with. It'd be just my luck to be in Mexico when the President decides to close the borders.
"Thank you calmjohn and so do you!!Fred T...they could close borders, who knows but again you, as a US citizen will be quaranteed but allowed back to your country. I am hoping they do not allow any travel to Italy or Asia..and honestly hoping they stop all cruise ships from stopping in Mexico. Who knows exact happenings in a Pandemic, should we go into that. Right now travel from US to Italy or So Korea. are requested not to be done. Apparently all traveling to US will be checked for illness, which is a start. ( temp. checks).Thus far we are not at H1N1 status, stay calm, wash your hands, be aware Mexico is prepared for lots of illness. Financially this is going to make a huge impact..on every country. I prefer to be proactive than buy into fear factors. Stay well, you feel sick stay home. If you did not get regular flu vaccine get it."
"Dow up 5% today. Largest point gain ever. Fred, surely you had shorted both the Dow & the S&P, being the financial soothsayer that you purport to be. Oh, wait, you actually didn't act on your prediction? ."
I believe I predicted a bumpy ride. Fat lady hasn't sung yet.
"People on Reddit are calling that Dow gain a ""dead cat bounce"""
"We have a trip booked to Mazatlán the end of April, if they will let us board the plane going down we will worry about getting back into the U S when we leave Mazatlán. Stay calm & wash your hands. Safe travels  Life is good"
@RedMeansRunSon - Dow already down by half of yesterday's uptick even with a Fed interest rate cut and the session is only half over. This dead cat didn't bounce much.
Tourist numbers up; tourist numbers down. I don't care.I'm laughing at the armchair global economists posting the doom and gloom. The markets fluctuate.Get over it.
LOL - you old enough to remember 2008? Sometimes a little gloom is totally appropriate.

"I missed my edit. For information. Some of the posters on this forum hardly think of Puerto Vallarta as a place to vacation, but almost as a second home. Many of us have passed the 20 year mark and the 50 plus trips to PV and many of those visits were not for just 7 or 10 days. We care about Puerto Vallarta and the area and it relies on tourists. If the tourists don't come many of the friends that we have made there have no jobs for them and their families.Some of us are truly world travelers, including myself. I believe that 6 continents and flew over the 7th puts me in the ball park.Let us all be friends and help our fellow travelers and even have a little fun occasionally as that is all of the pay that we receive."

"Suzie, Those statements of mine were made were made in respect to earlier comments of bragging how many times that they have been to PV. On this thread you have not been getting rude with other posters and getting close to profanity. Also, I came to PV when I was in the work force and after I retired.Perhaps not you as we have crossed paths before but I do have a number of friends in the PV area and some that I get along quite well on the forums. Forgive me, but by some of your previous posts I did think you were, as I am, well passed the retirement age.Now please let us all get back to discussing the tourist numbers and if they are holding steady or declining."

"yikes..chill guys and girls. I have been retired per se for 21 years and not yet close to retirement age. How we got into that is beyond me. Political discussions are not allowed on TA whether they fit like a glove or not. PV and Mexico have taken hits to tourism before and survived. As they will thru Corona Virus but not to imply it will not economically impact the area. Oh and should some of those new buyers find themselves in a bad siutation with their new lovely property purchase, there will be many, like me who will be happy to swoop in and buy off them. ;)The media has made the whole issue doom and gloom all over the world, so rather than bicker and argue lets wait and see. The days of sleepy fishing village many want are gone and have been for some years now, it is called progress whether we as foreigners like it or not. We helped this craze, overtipping, paying ever climbing prices and so on. I love PV before and now..I hope due to the proactive stance already taken here in Mexico they do not get hit too bad once again, but who knows.Without a little off track banter will make for a very boring forum.. chill..I suggest we all have a shot of mezcal with tajin and oranges. :).My financial advise, lol, travel and spend hehe.

"Back to the OP's question, I think numbers are steady this year. I am sitting on my balcony and have been since 5:30 a.m. I have watched two floating Petri dishes arrive already, and it is only 7:00 a.m. It is possible numbers will increase, rather than decrease, as it seems Mexico is still accepting cruise ships and some countries are turning them away. Just from being out and about, shopping, eating out, living my life, it seems numbers are about the same, maybe a slight increase over last year. JMHO"
We talk with friends in P V who are in the tourist industry almost daily & they all say tourism is up & holding steady. Vacation plans have been made for months & unless the airlines & cruise ships stop flying to or docking in P V the people will be on them. Next year may be a different story however.
I think that's absolutely correct. Too late for many people to make changes without penalties this year. Next year? Who knows? Lots of balls in the air.

"Calmjohn - was that opportunity for canceling related to the Corona virus?(I haven't made arrangements for my flights for June yet, just because I haven't.)"
"Kansas, American posted a notice this morning that if a person bought a ticket between now and 16 March you would be able to make a one time change. Then when I opened my flight to check on changes there was a notice that if I wanted to change a flight I could do it with no fee prior to 16 March.I don't know if this is everyone or just their frequent travelers.I would say as you are going in June it might be worth looking into. I paid little attention as of now I am firm going in April. Perhaps I should start checking my options."
Okqy thanks Calmjohn. Just wondered for future reference when I do buy my flights. hmmm I wonder if flight prices will go down if there is much spread of the virus. Time will tell I guess.
I will guess that they just might start dipping when they have several empty seats. Time will tell.
"I am holding off on my flight to Boston and also to Mazatlan, till we see where this goes. I am due back in PV in May and June, was thinking of flying but think I am going to stick to driving, those two trips.

I forsee lower tourist numbers in coming months due to the Covid 19 virus. That is just my opinion. ( Poor Corona beer!). Calmjohn.

Air Transat is offering a similar deal for March.I can imagine how worried everyone in the travel/tourism industry must be right now
Are these change deals for travel thru March or bookings made in March but for later in year?
"Ugh, try being here at ground zero in Seattle, working in a hotel. It is very very similar to immediately after 9-11. Occupancy has dropped by 50% for March just in the last 3 days. So far it has not affected our summer cruise client bookings, but I am sure it will if it continues."
Bezerk-The new rules are for bookings made in March (or the first half of March) for travel into 2021. The rules obviously vary by airline.
"Thanks KC I will pursue this further when I am back home and settled ;)Edited: 11:06 am, March 05, 2020 "
Been looking at flights to P V in Nov.& they have been really high. I am thinking the price will drop soon since we are getting closer to that date & the Corona Virus is now starting to spook some of the travelers. We are booked to Mazatlán in late April & if Alaska Airlines will let us on a plane we will be on it.  Safe travels Life is good
"@tatterdema I work downtown and today it's a ghost town. A lot of major companies are giving folks the option to work from home (not mine). I can only imagine the tourism industry right now.@ squee I just changed my flight to PVR to arrive Monday instead of Friday next week. I figured it would be better to get there sooner than later and my employer was flexible with my vacation usage. Alaska still charged me $125 for a flight change, but bc flight prices have dropped quite a bit (at least for next week) I got a bunch of miles back. I'm guessing prices might continue dropping for a while, but Nov. is still anyone's guess. As long as MX lets me in, I'll be there. Hopefully the US will let me come back but it is what it is."
"{Are these change deals for travel thru March or bookings made in March but for later in year?}The newsletter I received via email from Alaska gave the cut-off date of trips booked after February 27th only were eligible for changes, credits, refunds. It didn't specify about actual travel dates."
"@flannel, you got that right. The upside, no traffic during the commute.... The slaughter continues today with cancellations outpacing yesterdays. :-(I went to Palm Springs over the weekend, and the only precaution I took that I normally would not have, is I took my laptop so that I could quickly book a rental car or flight home if there were issues. Flight both directions were completely full. I would not hesitate to take my trip to Mexico, and plan to still go in May. Completely understanding of people who do not wish to travel though.@Suze, Alaska's website says travel until Feb28, 2021. I think they are being kind of pissy not refunding people who already booked. Kind of like saying, ""we got your money, suck it"".Edited: 6:09 am, March 06, 2020 "
"At the Krystal, our neighbours are from Seattle and it sounds as if your area is a centre of concern from what they said and you saidWe're here and have friends all over the world and nobody else seems to be even talking about it. We are washing our hands more thoroughly but we should be doing that anyway."
We washed & disinfected our hands a lot while in P V in Jan & Feb & still ended up with a very bad cold. It took my wife nearly 4 weeks to shake it. Luckily I got rid of it a little quicker so became the home nurse. Stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing & wash / disinfect your hands more frequently than you would normally. This too will pass. Safe travels  Life is good.
"I'm so overdue for a trip to PV. Would like to bring my mum down - just lost dad - just to get her some warm sunshine and low altitude and walking around and a change of scenery.

As I wrote on another thread, tourists and expats can afford great treatment at private hospitals if they become infected; most of the Mexicans you will interact with in restaurants, hotels, and condos cannot. They will be treated at the public hospital, where care and supplies can be limited. Please behave responsibly. This is about way more than money."
"Lol, I would not call Seattle ""heavily infected"" by any stretch. In fact, I doubt that Seattle is really any more infected than other places in the US. It just hit us first, and in a place where it was most noticeable (nursing home). Thanks to lack of testing, we just do not know.If no one travels to Mexico, I would imagine that the economy in PV would cause more of an impact that the illness itself. That is what I am more worried about, the impact to the economy.Edited: 8:44 am, March 08, 2020 "
"{I’m quite taken aback that people from heavily infected areas like Seattle would travel here or anywhere.}Your feelings do not correspond to facts. Seattle is not ""heavily infected"". Post like yours only contribute to the panic.Do you really want everyone in Seattle who is holding their usual spring plane ticket to Puerto Vallarta to cancel their trip?"
"hmm - well, we all make our own decisions. Some very prominent and reasonable voices are saying that the best advice for people over 70 which describes a large number of visitors to PV should not be flying unless it's absolutely necessary. I'll be following that advice and I'm canceling my May trip - but, I've got several fairly serious undying medical issues. Better safe than sorry. The fact that the market has taken a toll on my retirement holdings with little sign of quick recovery helped me in my decision making."
"That sounds like a reasonable, thoughtful decision, and not a knee jerk reaction to much of the hype Fred.I just saw on the news that they are recommending people in that age and health bracket not get on a cruise ship either. PV will take a hit on that aspect also.Unfortunately I think it (financial) is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. That includes Tourist numbers to Mexico, and everywhere else relying on tourism dollars. I know I am seeing forcast numbers not seen since 9/11, and staffing has been adjusted to reflect that. :-("
"All true tatterdema - no jerking of knees and not making decisions based on hysteria or making recommendations for others. CDC says don't fly (if you're in my demographic) so I'll err on the side of caution. And, yes, I'm afraid the economic toll may be worse than the public health toll - especially true for tourist destinations and cruises that are popular with the ""retiree"" set."
Agree completely Fred T. People need to be smart about this. Do what is right for them.Just to me that would not necessarily mean a blanket statement saying everyone from Seattle should cancel their Mexico trips this spring.
"Suze - agreeing - article this morning that I'm sure someone will say is ""fake news"" - it says your governor is considering more drastic measures. So, whether you ""should"" fly out of Seattle could become whether you ""can"" fly out of Seattle."
"Yeah, that why I took my laptop to Palm Springs, in case they closed the airport down, I could still get back home somehow. I would not rule out closing of borders at some point, but I am not going to let worrying about that run my day to day plans. If it happens, it happens, and I will find a way to get by. If I had kids to care for or something, I might think differently. Cat sitter might make a fortune, lol.I do take precautions, such as a friend that is currently in the hospital having had a lung transplant is not getting any visits from me until it is over. If my mom were still alive in the assisted living, I would not be visiting her in the way I did before."
An elderly report.I still plan my April visit although we have gone into a much safer mode around 'home'. Limiting our social engagements and having a complete physical just before departing. Have several small bottles of sanitizer and a few small spray cans I am flying business class so that an unknow stranger can't sit beside us. The problem is --What will be happening and what will be in place in early April.Kansas PV Girl and any others flying from and to MCI and DFW I would appreciate any input either here on the forum or by PM.
"Calmjohn how are you flying Business Class from MCI? Or did you mean First Class? (I'm not scheduled for PV until June, that is if I decide to go.)I did find this MCI website with info on the virus.https:/…"
Judging from the emails I am getting with discounted airfares...rock bottom might I add...there are lots of airplane seats left in the USA going to PVR...as well as ALL of Mexico. Normally at this time with Spring Break and Easter seats are usually booked well in advance...and prices shoot to the sky! Well...NOT now.Think about how complex the situation is NOW in the USA...and then ask yourself what Mexico is preplanning. MONITOR your booking/reservations as things are changing fast. With airline stocks dropping down so fast things can change...and you just might not get a notice of a major time change/or even day change.
"I checked my flight for May, and while not accurate, its a good indication of how full the plane is....only 33 seats assigned, and the price keeps dropping."
^^^good advice Judy. United announced some really ugly changes to their policies yesterday. Now no refunds if they can get you to your destination within 25 hours of your original flight. Used to be 2 hours.
"Kansas,Yes, it is domestic first class from MCI to DFW and becomes Business class from DFW to PVR. Then back business class from PVR to DFW and domestic first class from DFW to PVR. By the time I add in that I can check 2 bags free per person and sit with just my wife beside me (I prefer the aisle and she prefers the window) both sitting where we prefer. A meal between DFW and PVR each way not to mention the great leg room and better service and free drinks. My vacation starts when I get on the aircraft."
"Ok just wondered how you were going business class from MCI. That's a good idea flying business to avoid sick people sitting next to the two of you. I fly without my husband on some trips though, so have to sit next to somebody."
I understand that it is harder without your husband. I could not go without my wife.
"Yes, numbers are down for sure. We returned yesterday and the past week in town it was more quiet than usual. Our flight to Chicago was a little more than half full, and the flight attendant said the flight down had 29 people on it. The past week there has been 50 or less passengers on flights to PVR from ORD, and they were expecting flights to be cut, and that's just United Airlines."
At Dreams Villamagna right now and it’s really quiet!! Was in Puerto Vallarta yesterday and it was way less crowded as well!
"Now that some time has passed, it’s interesting, almost comical, to go back and read some of the spirited posts of the first 20-30 replies..."
Sometimes I hate it when I'm right. To RedMeansRunSon who not so nicely said I should sit down and shut up - what did I get wrong again???
Precisely.
Ive got to decide whether or not we go within a week. Still planning on it but am very concerned about what the bard and restaurants will do if tourists stop going. Stay open or close?

"tfdhusker, as time goes on even if some restaurants decide to close for obvious reasons, you will have more than enough restaurants to choose from. There are at least 1000 restaurants in PV. So no worries.Edited: 3:20 pm, March 11, 2020 "
Much slower
"Flew out if ottaws to pv last week since then canada has closed all but 4 airport to incoming intl flights except incoming domestic flights, and those from the U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean and from St. Pierre et Miquelon, can still land at other airports. No more flights out of canada on pkg deals. All canceled. Sunwing last flight mar 17th..after that just getting people home. No outbounds. Im on sunwing havent heard a plan yet since this change. Staying at riu jalisco...pretty empty. My flight down 1/3 had canceled. Noticed hand sanitizer at resort has changed and pretty sure it has no alcohol in it...im using my own now and trying to be extra careful keeping distance from people hand washing using my red solo cups i brought w me and my own alcohol and mix. 2 week quarantine when i get back to keep others safe. Time for everyone to take extra measures for the safety of all. Tip your servers and cleaners well..they may be out of a job soon."
"It is a worldwide pandemic. Why are people even thinking of travelling for leisure?I think it is selfish to travel for leisure during the pandemic.I also think it is irresponsible for bars and restaurants worldwide to allow dining in.I have a reservation for Puerto Vallarta commencing May 12, 2020.I haven't cancelled it (yet), but I will if the WHO says not to travel.Everyone must abide by the travel restrictions."
"Timothy, I believe that I noticed elsewhere that you had canceled. I, too have canceled my April visit. It felt like pulling teeth, but I knew that it was what I should do. Perhaps I am too optimistic but I expect travel to resume somewhat safely by the end of May. If the world wide self isolation has to continue until then our world will change so much it will be hard to recognize what we have had vs what we will have."
"Calmjohn #136,Yes, I cancelled my trip.I felt it was important to shelter in place at home.I am disappointed at the pace Mexico is addressing this worldwide pandemic.I am especially critical of how PV seems to be too complacent.Some restaurants are still allowing dining in and some bars are open as usual.I think everyone (worldwide) should shelter in place."
Mexico as most other countries have different cultures and different paces as to how the people will accept even very important information. From what I understand from friends in Mexico many feel that to give up their socialization is to give up life. Progress will be slowPerhaps closing the local gathering place would be like not allowing the river to be dyed in Chicago. They don't want to understand the validity of it. A friend of mine in Guadalajara said that confining the people to their homes is not unlike prison to them.We can just do what we think is right. Others can do as they see fit. I guess that is what a free world meansPerhaps we will need to find a new area to vacation...….If we survive..
"Mexico must follow the same regulations as the rest of the rest of the world. I don't care what their culture is.This is a worldwide pandemic.If they don't follow the WHO regulations, they deserve whatever consequences that will happen to them.Edited: 9:38 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Timothy,As perhaps you know I spent a large portion of my life defending the 'free world'. My prime mission was the defense of the United States, but it also overlapped to our allies. In light of that I was protecting religions in the U.S. who do not believe in the same medical care that most of us believe in. I was in defense of people who were strongly opposed to many of my personal beliefs. Some of our allied countries have since been very critical of the U.S.  I devoted that major part of my life, under at times some very undesirable circumstances, for freedom of choice. That applied to the countries as well. Now we all have freedom of choice. I do not feel that I have the right to find fault with another unless they present eminent danger to me.Mexico is one of those countries that I was honored to aid in defense against the communist threat and other actions after that. Now they have their freedom to act as they will.I may not agree with the decisions that Mexico or any other country may make, but until it affects me directly I will not wish them ill just so that I can vacation there again. I for one think that they deserve the best, even if they attempt it in a way that I do not see best."
"Calmjohn #140I respect your opinion, but I take exception to your statement ""I do not feel that I have the right to find fault with another unless they present eminent danger to me"".From my perspective; ANYONE on the planet who doesn't follow the World Health Organization's recommendations is presenting eminent danger.This is a worldwide pandemic. and Mexico and specifically Puerto Vallarta are NOT following the recommendations.Until Mexico and Puerto Vallarta are in FULL compliance I have no pity or sympathy for them.This goes for the rest of the world too (including the U.S.).Edited: 9:54 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Timothy, You seem to be a man of reasonable intelligence. Why aren't you busy with your home area? You can, perhaps do something there. You can only cause bad vibes for yourself by trying to reform Mexico."
"Timothy, are you in Mexico or PV? Since when did the WHO become the almighty power over running countries, they are only a recommending body. Your disdain and lack of concern for others are disturbing. I too see many folks all over the world not heeding their governing bodies requests, it scares me, but I would not wish ill on anyone. Those of us here in Mexico do not need your sympathy, preaching or hate."
