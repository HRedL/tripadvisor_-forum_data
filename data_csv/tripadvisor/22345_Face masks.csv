"Can anyone provide an update (covid related) if face masks are compulsory when on the beach, Rubican marina or when walking along the promenade and town of Plays Blanca? Also does anyone know if they need to be worn in hotels? Thank you"
It’s not compulsory to wear a mask on the beach or prom.There are not enough people around to worry about personal space.It is compulsory to wear them in shops and public transport. You also need to always have one with you.Bars and restaurants do not seem worried about wearing masks. Some staff are wearing some are not. Customers are not wearing them.

"Hi Charlotte . As long as you have mask on you , hanging on wrists etc , you’ll find few instances where you will have to wear them . Large stretch of prom have white lines down the middle now so make sure you don’t stray into wrong lane ha ha ."
