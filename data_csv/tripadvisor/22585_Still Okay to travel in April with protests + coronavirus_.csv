"I've been following posts on this forum for a while and I am really grateful for all the people so generously sharing information for the sake of other travelers!My partner and I planned to travel in Chile arriving in Santiago on March 27th and staying for about a months. Given the civil unrests, we planned to spend only a couple of days in Santiago visiting museums, a couples of days in Valparaíso visiting Neruda's house, and the rest of time in other cities seeing nature. We are two travelers from US in our twenties speaking no Spanish. On top of everything else, my wife just found out she is about one month and a half pregnant.Here are our questions:1. Should we worry about protests outside of Santiago, like in valparaiso (to what extent), Pucón, and Punta Arenas? 2. Chile locals, do you see the protests getting more violent in April with the referendum coming up? Or, alternatively, are worries about the coronavirus going to reduce the scale of protests?3. Does anyone have information on the schedule of protests in April? I know there will be a big one coming on March 29. Should we leave the country before April 26?4. Chile locals, is the government doing a good job testing the coronavirus? -- Is the published number trustworthy, or are many people not able to get tested, like in the US?5. Chile locals, what do you think is the likelihood the government will close down major tourist attractions or ban travel from the US?Thank you so much everybody in advance?"
At the pace things are happening with the virus and travel restrictions it is impossible to say where our country or yours will be. I think the protests are the least of your worries. Airlines are changing their schedules daily. American Airlines has cancelled all flights from DFW to SCL from the 19th of this month until 3 June due to low passenger numbers. I would see what your government's official advice about travel is before deciding. I would imagine that by April we will see some closure of museums etc but that information is not available yet.Protests usually stick to the same places as do marches and are fairly easy to avoid. I have no knowledge of any sort of schedule for April. .
"Thank you so much dancingmolly! For now it seems Lamax is going strong with flexible cancelation policies. The US advises its people to ""reconsider travel"" but has not issued travel bans to any country South America yet."
"1) currently there are some protests in valparaiso, and in minor scale in punta arenas. No protests in pucón. It could change suddenly.2 and 3) i could not tell what will happen with protests in april before the referendum (actually nobody do. The situation is quite unstable). As told before, there's no protest schedule for april. March 29 is the young combatant day, an annual event that is not that massive but quite violent. In that day, avoid either santiago or valparaiso downtown and wandering outside of touristical areas. I believe after the referendum (april 26) the things will calm down enough.4) i believe the preventive and reactive measures taken by the government are insufficient and on the fly, but the official number of infected is trustworthy. 5) nobody can tell that.In adittion, if your wife is pregnant be specially cautious with protests as tear gas could be dangerous for her and your kid"
"Thank you so much Camilo! I've been reading a lot of your posts and found them extremely helpful. Out of curiosity -- how would the referendum look? Will everyone go on the street and vote on the day of 26th?I thought it would be prudent to cancel the trip but my wife insisted. Of course we try our best to avoid all the dangerous areas to protest her and the baby!For now our plan is to arrive on March 30 (Monday), go see museums on tuesday and wednesday, go to valparaiso for the next two days and then fly to and stay in pucón. Then visit punta arenas April 11 - 18, the desert area 18- 25. In the cities we plan to stay in hostels far away from downtown and stay inside after dark. Is there anything we are being too naive about? I would love to hear anything from you! (And of course, any other locals or travelers.)Edited: 12:44 am, March 15, 2020 "
"The referendum day will be a public holiday and probably will be the electoral process with the greatest turnout of the last years. Many stores and public services could be closed, there will be crowds and queues arround voting centers (normally schools), and celebrations in the streets by the supporters of the winner option from the evening until the early morning. Avoid the celebrations as if they was protests.That said, i believe your plans are fine.Edited: 1:21 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Camilo, thank you so much for your patient explanations! I wish you and your loved ones stay healthy in this pandemic."
"Buy your booze the previous day as their is a restriction on alcohol sales the day of the election.So sit back in a comfy chair, turn of the television and lift a glass while watching a historic event.I have reservations on how peaceful things will be, depending on which side loses, their could be quite a temper tantrum in the streets."
"I agree with #1. You should worry about the coronavirus, not the election or the political troubles. Possibly they will even cancel this election. In France, they decided to keep the elections this weekend but that's hugely controversial."
Update: due to coronavirus the borders will close during 15 days
Thank you Camilo! I am so saddened...
"As of today, US state department has also issued a level 4 global do not travel advisory. https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…I am in Santiago right now and we are leaving tomorrow to fly back to the US. Many things are closed: tourist sites, parks, museums. Yesterday in Punta Arenas many restaurants were closed too, so I imagine it won’t get better anytime soon.Edited: 8:39 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Doug,,,in Argentina tomorrow all people must stay at home with some exceptions.Argentina take the desition of a total mandatory quarantine in all the countryI believe in Chile the authorities will take the same desitions in a few days more. Now all shopping centers are closed, schools closed, sports closed, recreative activity closed, national parks closed"
You are probably know that Chile has closed its borders to all except citizens and permanent residents.
"Can anyone advise on the situation in Santiago currently? Have read that shopping centres have closed. Are restaurants open for business whether eat-in, take out or delivery?"
"The Chile border is closed to everyone except citizens and permanent residents.Edited: 3:21 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"I had to cut short my vacation in Chile and return back to US couple of days back. If any visitor wants to get back to their country they need to get out now. After border closure, even though there is no bar on visitors leaving the country, it may be hard to get flights out since once flights get out, they cant come in with foreign passengers. Many aeromexico flights were canceled mainly because their serviced aeroplanes are now located outside Chile and they cant run services starting from Chile that way."
"Just about every shop in Santiago is closed, and restaurants are delivery only. Grocery stores are still well-stocked and pretty quiet."
"Hi Dennis,Are you one of the foreigners who decided to weather this out in Chilelandia?"
I am. So far it's seemed like a safer place to weather it than the states.
"FYI, Thursday at 10 pm, total quarantine (stay in home) for these comunas of Region Metropolitana - Lo Barnachea, Ñuñoa, Vitacura, Las Condes, Providencia, Santiago, Independencia) - subject to review after 7 days.Edited: 4:35 pm, March 25, 2020 "
Oh interesting- I hadn't seen that yet. I've been following the US Embassy's emails and Chile's Ministry of Health. Where'd you find that out? Thanks!
"Minister of Health announced this live on tele about half an hour ago, a circular will be released to explain the details."
Aaah- thanks a lot!
"If you need to go to the supermarket or pharmacy, you will need to go to the local Carabinero office for the permission slip."
"Wow, ok. I may have to leave Santiago then- sounds like things will be easier elsewhere."
"Dennis.....in big cities as Santiago the authorities will take more restrictions in the next days or weeks,,,,,,, Also In Chillan, Pedro de las Casas and Temuco are the main focus of the pandemic. Be careful and keep safe"
"Thanks, I'm playing it day-by-day. Just figuring out how to keep myself and others safe while hopefully avoiding a full quarantine."
From 10pm this evening there is a complete quarantine in the centre of Santiago for a week renewable.
You might want to find a place where you can hunker down without any problems. Try posting on the allchile.net forum if there is someone that is willing to rent to you and then the next step would be to find transport to said destination.Hope it works out.
