"With people getting the Novel Corona virus in Japan, should I cancel my trip in April?"
"If you're young, healthy and follow proper hygiene procedures, don't cancel it."

">> If you're young, healthy and follow proper hygiene procedures, don't cancel it.Just make sure you are OK with the probability that you could be stuck in a Japanese hotel for up to another 14 days in addition to your original vacation, if another guest in the hotel is confirmed.Cases in point: Feb 2020 Canary Island H10 Adeje Palace hotel May 2009 Hong Kong, Metropark Hotel WanchaiOr flights being cancelled, or your government imposing quarantine upon your return."
"Age doesn't matter. School children have been infected. A nurse (20's) in Kumamoto has been in serious condition for a few days with a ventilator device. A university student (20's) in Sapporo called ambulance. When she arrived at a hospital, she was already unable to talk and has been in serious condition since then."
Too early to tell re April. Consider it and see what happens in the next 3 to 4 weeks.
Epidemiological madness: https:/…
People will be asking about cancelling NYC soon. Air travel is the problem.
Over 45 years old?
"Mortality goes up somewhat at age 60 and way up after 80:https:/…At age 45, you're hardly a grownup, Keith :-)"
Lol.... almost there. Not feeling so young sometimes. :)
"Just go ahead to Japan, as Japan is very huge. If you are concern simply wear a mask will do. Life is destinated,"
I need a destinated driver to steer clear of that post.
Yeah I wouldn't want to be bringing the CVd19 into Japan from NYC - which seems a hotspot right now. Up until about last week(?) almost all of our CVd19 cases here in Australia were tracked to travellers arriving on flights from the US.
"Yes, an ""old"" post in terms of the developments. Interestingly, the 14-day quarantine mentioned a month ago as a possibility is now a reality. I don't think the OP will be travelling anywhere in April."
"You are traveling from a foreign country? If so, please remain at home. I live in Nara and though local businesses are having a difficult time, folks are trying to maintain social distance and any protocols that will stave off the pathogen. Community transmission is an immediate concern and to a degree can be flattened. Visitors from afar, should remain afar until the pandemic has subsided. Thank you."
Really? That is less than wise.

"I’m sure they will cancel it. I have a friend who had two trips planned, and both have been cancelled and one of hers wasn’t until June."
"If OP is from NYC, I certainly hope he/she has canceled."
You should ABSOLUTELY cancel going to Japan. I'm shocked you are actually asking for opinions. You should get a full refund.
They asked the question a month ago.
"Dear tokyoskater, I think that you should definitely cancel your trip this April. My opinion is that for certain time now everybody should cancel their trips. Not only trips but, depending on the area where we are living and depending on our situation, we should even try to avoid going out altogether. This will help to stop spreading the disease, not to speak about avoiding getting infected. Think of the long flight itself. Think of possible quarantine. Think of those large amounts of people who are already ill and many of them in very bad condition, many of them young and dying. Now we should concentrate on overcoming this pandemic. I believe that when it is over you will be able to visit any place you like and this is what I hope for myself. My best wishes to you and stay healthy."
"Wish all of you are safe at home.Edited: 10:50 am, April 05, 2020 "
"yes, I would. not worth the risk. just get credit for the trip to go another time"
The main point of social distancing is to avoid unnecessary travel and even getting outside of your house for travel means that exactly. Going to an unknown place or a hotel is the exact same. You don't know how many people were in that room you're gonna be in or if they have cleaned it properly and disinfected the surfaces in the right way. Lots of people might be in your situation and tell themselves so if I'm young and healthy (which has not been safe either!) then it's ok if I go to a trip which I could postpone to next year or another time. And there will be chaos and crowds will be all over the place which is not safe. What if you're an asymptomatic individual who can make others sick just by going places and touching stuff and etc.? So common sense says you should stay at hone and cancel your trip.
"Every time you repeat your post hfot2 pointing out how outdated this thread is, you extend its life unnecessarily.We get it! :)Edited: 7:51 pm, April 14, 2020 "
I'm really enjoying this thread.
"Still surfing the pages for the forum of the trip that will not happen for us next month. :(But in answer to your question, I suppose we are moths drawn to the flame of inanity your empty and unnecessary repetition ignites."

"If one is young and healthy then supposedly it is less risky to travel. What does that mean? Depends on energy level and body feeling. If someone is feeling the difference to younger days, then they would be older. If flexible and energetic then they are younger . But this is my personal opinion. The doctors hear said that women are considered younger until mid forties for medical but... everyone’s different in how they age. A consiration too is...if you do get sick...is the place you are okay to be sick...does it have supportive health care and environment conducive to health...and are those you care for and who care for you nearby.Edited: 10:06 pm, April 25, 2020 "
