"Maybe a silly question but IF Thailand borders are still closed to international flights from the UK (via Dubai), am i correct in assuming our Emirates flights will have to be cancelled? We are meant to be flying from the UK on 27th July, and due to ridiculous flight schedule changes, due to arrive in BKK on 29th July. I am hoping Emirates just cancel the flight now (in the hope of achieving a possible refund) but just need to wait until nearer the time. Also, our return flights from Bangkok to Ko Samui are still scheduled (and will presumably stay scheduled) but obviously, if we cannot get to Thailand - we will not be on them! Can anyone advise on how i should proceed in trying to get any of my costs back in this situation? I am guessing travel insurance OR do you think bangkok airlines may offer a flight credit voucher or something?Problem is, these flights were not booked direct with airline, but thro 3rd party agents byojet & opodoAny advice is much appreciated. Thanks."
"As u mention Travel Insurance,you may try your luck here.Pray Hard and God bless you.Chok Dee"
"""Problem is, these flights were not booked direct with airline, but thro 3rd party agents byojet & opodo...""(Hope you saved a lot of money with this arrangement!)-Have you checked with this ""3rd party agent?""Good luck."
"Hindsight is a wonderful thing & i have now realised the mistake of booking 3rd party, but this wasnt the question i was seeking advice on...IF Thailand borders are still closed on July 27/29th, then am i right in assuming that the Emirate flights have to be cancelled?"
"Yes, if Thailand is not accepting international tourists then Emirates will cancel in which case you should be refunded.If the Bangkok Airways booking is separate and their flights are operating then you might get them to refund or they might offer a rebooking or you might just lose out as a no show - in which case you might have a claim on your travel insurance?"
"That assumption is false. The international borders are indeed ""closed"" and probably will be for some time, especially for Europeans. But some flights will still operate. These are for: 1.repatriation of Thai citizens from overseas, 2. Incoming foreigners who have special permission such as work-permit holders, certain professionals, diplomats, people whom the government deams are necessary, 3. an amorphous group of people who can get round the ""rules"" and whom we can only imagine but Thai people would know who they are."
"Ok #5, I should have said 'probably' cancelled. There are no Emirates flights listed to land at BKK tomorrow 8 June, pre Covid19 there were several every day."
"Thankyou , these replies are helpful. Im Hoping they are cancelled but its a waiting game..."
"I know its hindsight but if you had booked with emirates direct you could have refused the changes in flight times and applied for a refund,iv done this myself after speaking to emirates.it looks like your travel agent has agreed to the new flight times!"
"Good luck claiming back from 3rd party. Beware, many travel agents/3rd parties offer vouchers. Your Bangkok Airways refund will go to 3rd party agent. He has the option of giving you a voucher or cash. Should he go belly up before you can use the voucher your refund is useless. Advice: don't accept a 3rd party refund voucher."
"Given that your flights are taking 2 days to get to BKK I'd have expected that Emirates would have given you the option to cancel without charge as that is a ""ridiculous flight change"". Whatever happens you'll incur cancellation charges from your 3rd party.Also, Emirates have a flight leaving LHR on 27/7 @ 14.20 which arrives in BKK @ 13.15 on 28/7. I'd be asking for this itinerary and no other. This might also be cancelled as things are changing from day to day."
I doubt if UK tourists would be allowed in Thailand or most countries for that matter as early as July.
"Probably the same would apply to tourists from other countries with high Covid-19 mortality or/and high mortality rate. US, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Spain, etc."
"I had a five week trip booked to Thailand and Cambodia from July 16th. I had a none refundable hotel booked and paid for in Bangkok, two return international flights and one return internal flight. I also had car parking at Heathrow.I've had confirmation from all the companies I've contacted that I'll receive full refunds (including the non-refundable Hotel) and I've actually received into my bank full refunds from two of the companies.I think it's just a case of asking. They've all been great for me."
"tinks, I'm curious to know if you booked your hotel room directly with the hotel or through an agent.Edited: 5:01 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"It was through Booking.com. They reached out for the refund, hotel accepted. Full refund."
"OK, thanks for the helpful info. I think I may have to go through the same process if my trip to Bangkok next October does not take place."
"Thats good re refunds. Bookingcom have been very good i hear. I have non ref hotels with ebookers. One hotel in BKK has confirmed cancellation without fees but ebookers need to contact them. The other hotel I am still awaiting a reply. With regards to flights, i contacted Emirates, and Byojet. To my sheer surprise (having read all the negative reviews abt 3rd party bookings) , byojet have emailed confirmation of a full refund for the “unacceptable new flights”No fees mentioned.. maybe its too good to be true but will wait and see....."
"Check emirates policy on flight changes... I’ve had to look into this for Thai Airways. If a significant change is made, I.e a difference of 12hrs in flight or the flight number has changed then if you do not agree to new proposals you are eligible for a full refund on both legs of flight.Even though it’s through a 3rd party, if you have no joy with them you can still deal with airline direct regardless of what they tell you. In fact the airline should have contacted you directly to inform you of changes.As for BKK to Samui I’d say at best, get in touch with airline and ask for vouchers... most offer them to be used within 12 months, some longer.Im having same issues with U.K. to Bangkok then onto Bali at the moment.Edited: 8:22 am, June 10, 2020 "
"Paulj2578, thanks for reply. I am guessing this is why byojet have readily agreed to the refund (i was surprised) because the flight changes were definetly over 12 hours delay. I will contact bangkok airlines for a voucher offer.. sounds like it may be the best available option (if they agree) but will need to go thro opodo , who are not even accepting emails at moment (compared to byojet) At least a voucher gives us an incentive to try and visit again one day..."
