"With so many unknowns and the situation getting worse almost daily, COVID-19 obviously is making it's impact felt. So tell me, have you cancelled an upcoming trip or considering it?"
Nope...haven't cancelled it and NOT EVEN considering it!!
People seem angry with their responses. They put words in caps and use multiple exclamation marks. Why?
DTC...all you ever do is comment on other peoples posts. WHY don't you just focus on answering the OP's question for once??
"If I were travelling in the next month I would cancel. That would be for any major airport just because you know they aren’t disinfecting everything. I’m also a germaphobe and find it shocking how people just don’t wash there hands. In LV alone at least 2/3 people walk out of a restroom without washing there hands, this is based on my own observation and I’m also the guy that calls people out."
Not cancelling. Things are not really getting worse... yet.
"Nope, not yet. Any trip could be my last so I am not inclined to panic. Not until O;Sheas closes and Criss Angel cancels. I may be a silly old man but today Vegas looks safer than Florida and is perhaps the same as Minnesota. At least the CDC map of cases suggests so. I will wash my hands thoroughly and frequently cuz at my age...Edited: 10:51 pm, March 10, 2020 "
I won’t cancel. I may postpone it. I’ll be going to Vegas for sure June-August unless this thing spirals out of control.
"I canceled my April trip, more because my travel buddy got a new puppy than the virus. Was in Vegas over Presidents Day. I rescheduled to September, with a probable trip in June."
"There it is again...caps and double question marks. I have decided to wait until more is known; I think that's wise. I was going to go sometime this summer. However, I can go anywhere and at any time."
"Not Vegas, but I just made plane and hotel reservations to Orlando for three weeks from now (to go to a business training event), it was really hard. The hotel I can walk away no charge if I call by 6pm the day of arrival, the airline tix are changeable. I still feel weird because it's not the way I typically operate - make a decision and go.I watched a Dr. Drew interview and came down off the ledge a bit. I may make a ""day of"" choice if the news goes horribly bad. So far this ""pandemic"" is statistically insignificant compared to the flu. That could change. If I were going for ""fun"" I'd probably put it off for a while.I don't do much gambling in Vegas. If I were going for gambling I'd probably invest in a lot of alcohol wipes.Edited: 11:03 pm, March 10, 2020 "

@DTC not after post 1 that you already responded to did anyone do that. Slow your Minnesota role.
Coming next month. Not cancelling unless airline shuts down. Coming with 9 of my family members and we are all good and not worried.
"Because flight prices have dropped out of NYC, I'm considering booking for this weekend. Just need to clear it work wise."
A deal is not a deal if it costs you time at your company/work or if your insurance doesn’t cover unforeseen outbreaks.
CO...post#3
Grow up DTC!
"I'm replying to CO, not u."
We leave Saturday. Canceling has not even been discussed. We are laughing at everyone in full spazz. What are we on week 6 or 7 and this has yet to blow up like our faithful msm has promised us. “Next week” “next week” is what everyone says. Well we’ve gone thru 4 weeks of that and is it getting worse ?
"Tempname, nothing was going to ""blow up"" or nor was anyone going to spontaneously combust. Its a really infectious virus that can be deadly for older people and people with autoimmune deficiencies. Don't you think its gotten worse? Italy, China and other countries have shut down completely. Nothing wrong with taking precautions.To answer the question, I am supposed to be going next week for March Madness and as of now still plan to go depending on how things shake out."
"We are one of the people scrambling. We were scheduled to leave Galveston on a weeks cruise in 10 days. With government warnings, insurance companies dropping “travel advisory” countries or in this case, industries (cruises) from coverage, we decided to cancel. Carnival will give full credit for later cruises, so that turned out great. We are hoping to make lemonade out of the proverbial lemon, by spending the week in Vegas. I was shocked at the prices.... lowest I’ve ever seen. MGM $46/night, Harrah’s $30, Bellagio $117, Aria $92 and Mirage $58. And this is in CANADIAN dollars on Expedia, so take a good third off those prices. There have been a lot of people saying they are not cancelling but........P.S. Yes I know resort fees are added on"
"I'm booked to go late April/early May. The conference I was going to cancelled today. I haven't cancelled yet and will wait til much closer to the date to see what is happening then, but it's not looking good. I cannot find myself in a position where I'm quarantined for 2 weeks at the end of the holiday, and I think it may be difficult to get travel insurance to cover hospitalisation for the virus. I'm in my 50s with immune system issues and note that approximately 20% of diagnosed cases are requiring hospitalisation. I also have a trip booked to Hawaii for end of May. I'm trying to stay optimistic re both trips as I was so excited about them until about a week ago! But if I have to cancel, I'll likely re-book for July/August in the hope that it will be safer to travel then."
@drizzzt. Did you book? Scheduled for Vegas in 13 days and just taking it day by day. Also in YYC.
their....
"The CV acts like the flu, it likely won’t be a problem when the desert heats up. I’m booking a spot for my RV mid May."
Yes I just cancelled my travel plans. Indian Wells tennis tournament was cancelled and Vegas was both the front and back end weekend portion. Not happy but I will take a knee and book for Easter I hope.
"I've no plans to cancel my Easter trip but, if things get worse there may be a possibility I may cancel.Will monitor and see what happens."
"Over 2 Million people live in Southern Nevada (Las Vegas). As of today, 4 people have been diagnosed with the virus in the State of Nevada (3+ million population). Over 32 Million visitors come the Las Vegas Valley each year. Do the math. You are more likely to be hit by a car and killed in a crosswalk."
Not cancelled and have no plans to do so - I could catch it by staying at home.
I am scheduled to go end of April. Have not cancelled yet. Will postpone trip if necessary.
I was coming for Easter. Have rescheduled for Memorial Day.
"We are going March 22nd, for our first visit. We are taking it day by day. If some of our bucket list places to visit close, we would cancel. Hoping to see Hoover Damn and have tickets to Love. If we cancel 72 hours in advance, we would only be out the $150 for Love and have travel credit with Southwest. If we had to cancel, I don't know if we would make it to Vegas anytime soon. Our schedules are crazy and I have no desire to go to Vegas in the summer."
We will be there at Easter and won’t cancel. The only way we won’t go is if our flight gets cancelled and the decision is taken out of our hands
we will be there week of March 23 - planning on going unless reports get increasingly worse or flights cancel taking it out of our control. Looked at our seat assignments on both flights yesterday - both planes are only about 50% full to & from Vegas. Wish we could take advantage of lower room rates now but already locked into a package price with our airline.
"I am more worried about it being cancelled for me with airport closures or Govt advice changing to advise not to travel.We are coming on 23rd, and worried that the mgm buffet closures is just the start"
"Cancelled for 3/17-3/21, more because of recent surgery then Coronavirus, but would be a tough call. the concern is the possible disruption it can cause more so then actually getting the coronavirus ...There IS a reason rates have dropped like a stone, many cancellations.."

I leave two weeks from today. No plans to cancel at all unless the airlines do it for me.
"Planet, no need to worry in the US, the bloviator in the WH has said it was contained weeks ago...you should feel 100% safe now...also he mentioned that the spread of the virus is NOT inevitable, so that should also provide some comfort.."
Leave in 2 weeks for Vegas have no plan to cancel. Hoping airlines don’t cancel flights. Also hoping things we want to see and do remain open. Refuse to stop living.
"The SARS & most particularly the MERS Viruses were far much more serious due to their high levels in the mortality rate. But yet people didn't go berserk over them when they'd each struck. It seems most folks today are profusely glued to media reporting, which strangely enough has them immed. shifting into an hypochondriac state mode. I'm not necessarily trying to downplay this latest virus; however & just the same, I'm not going to up play it (this virus) either.This isn't to state I won't comedown with the virus. But should I happen to, it was most probably while shopping at the grocery &/or drugstore(s), at anyone of the local shopping malls or discount stores visited, or from 100s of other things or places I come in contact with upon an almost regularly daily basis.Not sufficient enough of a threat nor reason for me to be cancelling any of my vacation travels. Nether am I about to lose any sleep over it by turning into a worry wart."
"I have no intention of cancelling, unless travel restrictions are in place when I'm due to be there in early May. Especially as the Palazzo, which was quoting almost $500 a night a few weeks ago, is now $145 a night. I was fretting about where to stay but now I have my first choice at a price I find reasonable."
"I'm with BaseballDC. Living in the DC Metro, with such a huge concentration of people EVERYWHERE, I'm not sure it's any more or less risky for me to be in Vegas. And Vegas is way more fun. :)"
I have hotel reservations for Oct but holding off on the airline commitment pending further developments.....as I wait and see.
"I won't be cancelling my Las Vegas trips. They will have to be cancelled for me by circumstances outside of my control.If the casino dealers take to wearing face masks, then I will expect disposable face masks to be made available by the casinos to patrons at cost price. I don't expect this situation to arise, but I'm OK with measures of this nature."
"i'm going april 5-9 and june 20-24some on here will be happy if i catch this thing and die, though i'm not quite at the average worldwide age that dies from it....which is 80."
">>>On the plus side Matt Bridger is scheduled back in Vegas I believe today so we can watch fun vlogs to divert our attention in the evenings for a while.<<<I think he said that he lands today, which means we'll get a vlog sometime tomorrow or maybe Fri. :)"
"""some on here will be happy if i catch this thing and die"" - Jebus man, that is a sad perspective, lol. I wouldn't wish that on anyone, but I have been around here for a while and I can see your point.13"
"ESPN...average age of death is 80 so if 100 folks die at age 79 and 100 die at age 81 does that mean no one at age died at age 80 ?Edited: 10:46 am, March 11, 2020 "
it means the average age of people who die from covid-19 is 80
My point was only meant to show how misleading some stats can be.I would rather look at the median # rather than an ave. #.
"My job just issued a travel ban. No out of state business travel. Personal travel you have to tell HR and then they will decide whether to keep you home 2 weeks after your vacation. So I'm thinking Vegas will warrant an isolation! But, I'm starting to get afraid to go to the airport with all those people. So it's not looking good right now. I'd say I'm cancelling. Just waiting to see if JetBlue does something before I actually pull the plug."
"Let me explain Nuzza's 100 at 79 100 at 81. So for this case to calculate the median you take the 2 middle numbers and divide by 2. Thus, the median is 80. >80<"
my example was only for an ave score etc.Median statistically...relating to the middle value in a series of values arranged in order of size....sorry for the confusion.
"Not canceling trip for April yet, but I'm nervous that activities will start to close down. I am not too concerned about getting the virus personally because of my age and risk profile, but I don't want to be part of the problem in contributing to the spread of the disease to more vulnerable populations. The consensus of public health experts seems to be that we need to be taking stronger measures, so I am trying to start to prepare myself that this decision may be made for me by 3 weeks from now."

"Just a heads up. NY had 3 cases a little more than a week ago, Just now Gov. Cuomo announced ALL State schools are going to remote learning in a week. Meanwhile the NBA is about to announce some if not all games will be played in empty arenas. Vegas has 4 cases."
I am not in the hysteria camp but I do think that there are a few people who have commented on this thread who also play roulette betting a Martingale.4 cases? Think very soon 4-8-16-32-64-128 etc. If we're lucky. We do not have enough info yet on the denominator of the infection formula. We know the deaths but not the infection rate.And Europe is soon to be ground zero if it is not already.
"I'm guessing there will be many, many more cancellations in the next few days as the NAB just cancelled their conference. I would expect rates to further plummet. It will be interesting to see if the NFL makes any makes any decisions regarding the draft in the next few days."
"I just did. Well we both mother and I decided to cancel our trip to vegas. We’ve been weighing our prospects for weeks now and today sealed the deal We are sad to not go especially with all that has gone on with us but we are confident we made the right decision first and foremost for my mother’s safety , mine , that of others should I become a carrier , and should be also be stuck in vegas or any airport should the nation decide to shut down. With the official announcement of the pandemic , and even if vegas and our community has only a few case , we decided to change our behavior. We would normally not let fear obsess us or control us but this is beyond all of that. I’ve been following massive forums with key statistics , educated reasoning as well as that of the “opposite possitive side “ with all the information I’ve gathered and the constant worry and trying to make reason out of it all I’ve officially decided.... that cancellation is inevitable and the right thing to do. Let us all pray and hope that in a few months this all changes for the better. Thank you"
"To answer the question I cancelled a trip scheduled for March 5. I will be cancelling a trip scheduled for April 24 too.I am in a high risk group as I have several autoimmune diseases. I would like to try to explain some of the challenges I face as I try to avoid contracting Covid-19 so maybe it will make some understand why slowing down the rate of transmission is critical.I am staying home and only go out if it absolutely necessary. When I do I go during off peak hours. I follow all recommended precautions. I am under 60 as is my husband. This is problematic since he is still working. He is doing everything possible, including working from home when possible. Again he is following all precautions.As with many people with autoimmune diseases I do have doctor appointments and have a treatment once per month that takes place in a clinic at a hospital. Ironically this treatment is for boosting my immune system. At some point I will likely contract this virus no matter what I do to prevent it. I am one of the lucky ones since I do not work and do not have to work. I feel for those who are at high risk that do not have that luxury.What is vital for people like me is availability of hospital beds and equipment that is necessary to be available. By slowing down the rate of transmission makes this possible. We can do that by limiting mass exposure. I am not sure why that is so difficult to understand. Does that mean you should stop living your life because of other people's vulnerabilities? Not at all. Should people who are not high risk stop travel? I think that is a personal choice right now with no right or wrong answer. Is it a real hardship for large events or places that risk mass exposure to be postponed or cancelled or temporarily closed to prevent escalation of the virus? Again I have posted this to try to explain challenges faced by people with autoimmune diseases and to explain the reasons that self isolation is not the only answer to this problem."
"""We can do that by limiting mass exposure. I am not sure why that is so difficult to understand. "" - Because too many people are labeling this as ""media hype"" and aren't taking it seriously enough. As you probably know, there's more dim bulbs than bright ones these days.13"
"Latest News, a NYC woman staying at the Mirage attending the Women’s Power Conference at the Mirage since March 6, tested positive for coronavirus. Now, I’m having second thoughts on visiting LV."
"With the Covid 19 being in the Mirage, got to be more cases in the next week"
Just canceled my trip for 3/22 - 3/29. Personally I am willing to travel but the conference I was attending got postponed and a concert I had tickets for was canceled. I see now that MGM is closing buffets. I expect there will be a lot of other things shut down as well. I was able to get refunds on everything so I'm going to wait a few more days and hopefully book a trip to somewhere with a beach.
Nope.
Luv to travel might need to change name to luv to cancel
Not me.
Billy don’t be a heroDon’t be a fool with your life..Billy don’t be a heroCome back to me
"I live in a densely populated downtown area. I shop at busy stores and ride the crowded train almost daily. I could get sick just as easily going about my business at home, so I'm not cancelling my April trip. I'm washing my hands twice as much as I used to, and am more cautious about what I'm coming in contact with. If I start feeling sick, then I'll stay home from work and cancel any travel plans. Until then, I'm not going to let this impact my daily life."
"Travelling from region to region is how this will spread. So while I'm happy you'll be fine (Me too!) there a 70 million people who won't who are gonna rely on all of us to at least mitigate the spread.That said, this is a moot point. Even thought they are dragging their feet all they can, it is becoming entirely certain stringent national travel restrictions will be imposed within a week. It's moving that quickly."
"@upstate. I ha e to tell you , all your compelling arguments really hit home with me and although I tried to find every reasoning not to go like , we could get hit with a car tomorrow or our plane could crash scenarios , the cons still greatly out weighed the pros. And like it was said a million times , this is and was a leisurely trip for us. So we will just wait to leisurely travel when this hopefully dies down On a possitive note united offered us zero change fees even though we booked our tickets back In Early February after my father passed and vegas.com is giving us a full refund on our show tickets and the Wynn well that was comped so only thing lost was our anticipation to have a good time. Even though I’m sure the entire time I would be there I’d be paranoid as f. So thanks again upstate for your logical and Intelligent responses. Now let us all focus positive energy and hope this dies down significantly soon Mahalo"
"Be safe angelina and don't worry, Vegas will be there waiting for us. The workers in particular will need our money and I for one will be there to spend some."
"Exactly, Vegas will be there...plus nobody knows what will be open, closed, quarantined if you were visiting"
Thank you upstate. Yes we will be there to support our vegas peeps soon enough
"The Cal? Um no thank you. Although my prefers it , last thing I want to do is see my people when I’m trying to get away for a bit of something different. Hahaha. Nah I enjoying saying hi to all the aunties uncles cousins and friends I see there but I prefer the Wynn"
"We have booked from Boston, nonstop to Vegas and have never seen prices so low, in over 30 years of going to Vegas. Have also booked a couple other rock bottom prices on flights!!!! Not at all concerned."
Yes! We were supposed to fly out on the 22nd of March.
"Birddog51, I said the same thing about it might be my last trip. So many back surgeries and an autoimmune disorder. I’m going with a fun group to celebrate my 65th birthday and I’m going to live it up! My son doesn’t want me to go, but I can’t wait."
My trip is beginning of April. I think age and health is a big deciding factor when making a LOGICAL decision. Since I fall into the high risk category I am cancelling. Vegas is like a Petri dish of germs and people do a horrible job hand washing. I really wouldn’t want to be quarantined in luv.
I just cancelled my trip for next month to the World Cup dressage championships at the Thomas & Mack. I cancelled my Aria reservation. Had two out four days comped. Went back into Mlife to see what is now being offered and every singe resort has those 4 days now comped.
"Not cancelling where going this weekend. However, I did cancel our trip to Mexico for July."
"If I had to guess, there's better than a 50/50 chance March Madness is postponed or cancelled entirely. We are a few days from true mass testing, the rise in the number of cases confirmed might be stunning.Take for instance my hometown, a small city. The first confirmed case was today. But they are all but certain there are 20 more who just finally got tested."
March Madness is a go just no fans for now. Unfortunately this will kill the XFL.
"I would be stunned if any March Madness viewing parties happen in LV...so if your going for MM, be aware"
"""Media Hype"" It is like the boy who cried wolf. They have hyped up so many things no wonder people laugh it off. Our trip is in 10 days. I have 7 days to cancel the hotel. Flight is Southwest so I will get credit. Unless Cirque Love is cancelled, I would be out the $150 I spent on tickets. More than likely we will cancel."
We were booked to go on the 26th. Cancelled today. Not as worried about getting the virus as spreading it to vulnerable people or getting quarrantined in Vegas.
"""We were booked to go on the 26th. Cancelled today. Not as worried about getting the virus as spreading it to vulnerable people or getting quarrantined in Vegas.""This. I could probably survive an infection. But I have elderly parents whom I visit regularly; I don't want to put them at risk."
"We're not scheduled until mid May. We've plenty of time to cancel..will just monitor the bees nest up until shortly ( a week or so) before the trip, unless the situation truly combusts in the interim...which is entirely possible/ probable."
"At this stage, only way I wouldn't cancel is if I get it and recover from it before it's time to go....and even then, I might cancel because I believe much of Vegas will soon be shutting down."
"Due to tracel April 8th and although Ireland is not banned yet I can only imagine it's a matter of time.I will hold off to see if that transpires, however I will most likely now cancel this trip."
"I have 2 weeks booked in Vegas in mid May and really want come but expect I will have to cancel due to closed borders and travel bans. I also have no interest in coming if its a ghost town because bars, restaurants and buffets have closed."
"#98, yes, wait and see if you are forced to cancel. If you cancel earlier through 'disinclination to travel' then your insurance won't pay up. It will probably be a decision that is made for you."

"I was on the fence for awhile, but Im cancelling as well. NBA suspending the season and the travel ban pushed me offI don't want to go and just play poker with the local card sharks"
"We were planning a 10 day visit for the end of the month but will be cancelling it, and looking to rebook later this year.Reasoning:--Some of our group are in the age/high risk factor category--Wouldn't want to be quarantined and unable to return--It just seems like the socially responsible thing to do; limit non-critical travel to slow the spread of this brand new virus to avoid overwhelming health care resources once this wave does crest."
">""Media Hype"" It is like the boy who cried wolf.""<Yeah, and it ends with his sheep dying."
"My trip of a lifetime will be Easter Long Weekend. My daughter is a competitive synchronized swimmer, national level and as a single mom, I have saved for years to take her to O. Paid for everything back in October, VIP tickets, flight, hotel, nothing insured. I struggle with my decision to cancel. It will break her heart if we don't go but then again, if I get quarantined in a hotel room if there is an outbreak, with a 17 year old? That is what scares me the most."
"We just cancelled our trip for the NFL Draft. It doesn't matter if the draft is canceled or not, we are not going. I already canceled the room reservation, I will cancel the SW airfare for a credit."
"I'm in the process of cancelling, though I really don't want to. I had every intention of going in April, and have been planning this trip for close to a year now. It was supposed to be my wife's first time meeting an old high school friend of mine and his wife, to whom he was recently married. We're all reasonably young and healthy, so I'm not particularly afraid of getting the virus. I would also be driving, so I wouldn't be in any airports or planes, although my friend and his wife would be flying.Unfortunately, he just informed me he's having to cancel. Since meeting them was the whole point of the trip, we basically have no reason to go anymore, and it would be a major hassle anyway since we have a dog. But our hotel is non-refundable. It was so cheap, so if that were the extent of it, I'd be okay. But I just recently bought expensive show tickets that my friend requested, so I'm a little upset about that. Now I have to try to find some way to get rid of them that will recuperate at least some of my money."
Be patient Slug as it's becoming clear shows and even rooms will be closed and you'll thus get a refund.
"We did not have any trips on the books for LV, but have 7 planned trips - most hang in the balance.If we did have LV on the calendar, we would be weighing things - just as we are for our booked trips, and one of those to London.A highly volatile situation right now, especially regarding travel plans.Best of luck to all,Hunt"
Felt I was left no choice today. Was supposed to leave 2 weeks from yesterday for my bachelor party. Hoping to reschedule this summer.
"#111,Yes, the situation IS highly volatile, and changing by the hour.I would never blame anyone for being torn.Hunt"
"If there was no concern, I would have expected trump to be in Vegas tonight for his event...rates are free for a reason..."
"With sadness, we are canceling our trip for the first week of April. Living in one of the main outbreak areas (Seattle), we feel it would be irresponsible of us to engage in unnecessary travel at this time, and giving how rapidly conditions are changing, we are not sure what we would even find were we able to make it to Vegas. We are fortunate in that we did not prebook any shows or events, and since our flights are with Southwest, we'll be able to rebook our airfare for a future date without penalty."
My trip is scheduled for the end of May so not at the point I need to consider yet
"I wouldn't have thought so a week ago, but I cancelled my March 30 trip today. A little too much uncertainty for coming across a border as to what what travel will be allowed, risk of quarantines coming home, etc, etc. Airline offering free cancellation right now, so took advantage of that."
"We are due to leave on the 23rd ,,,March,,, I’m still on the fence. I’m more concerned that there will be limited places open. It seems things are changing hour by hour. Day by day. Then wondering if we go, we will have to stay away from my mom who’s in a nursing home and my grandkids when we return. Decisions decisions,,,,,"
Tough decisions....good luck
"“ Then wondering if we go, we will have to stay away from my mom who’s in a nursing home and my grandkids when we return. ”How much do you have to wonder about the nursing home thing?"
"Our trip was scheduled for the 25-1st, starting with a stop to visit family in Sun City, AZ then head to Vegas for 4 days, then back to Sun City for a day before heading home. I decided to cancel today because I don’t want to bring the virus to Sun City- I worry how badly the residents would be hit by the virus, since they are all 55+ and more likely to be high risk. I think it’s socially irresponsible to go. I also don’t want the anxiety for 2 weeks after getting back worrying about getting sick.My husband still thinks we should go but his worry is that everything in Vegas will be closed and it wouldn’t be a fun trip. Unforgettable, guaranteed. Fun, probably not. Assuming the shows we got tickets too aren’t canceled, we’d just be out $200 for show tickets, so not that bad. Plus, hopefully we can reschedule for September and get to see Kelly Clarkson- I’d much rather see her than the shows we got tickets to!"
Irish fan I would stay away from the nursing home and depending on how old the grandkids are if they are babies or have underlying conditions stay away. listen to Michael Osterholm on you tube he has a wealth of knowledge.I
People compare this virus to SARS and MERS those viruses you got sick and then you were contagious with this virus you are contagious before you show symptoms that is worrisome.
Still booked for May. Sure hope things settle down by then so I can enjoy one of my FAVORITE destinations without having to be quarantined (caps are for DTC cause I know he LOVES them...lol). Fingers crossed!!Stay healthy everyone!! :)
sorry posted as a topic in parallel but am sad to say I cancelled my Mon departure last nightAs a few people have said things are changing on an hourly basis so not prepared to take the riskhave a booking for Oct and as soon as things get better I will be re booking
"I'm booked for the last week of April. I think by then the UK will be in a state like Italy. My concern though, is if we do go, then will everything be closed out there and then its just a wasted trip really"
After being on the fence we finally canceled too. were booked for March 23-27. Full refund & will definitely rebook when this blows over. Can't risk getting Quarantined in Vegas for 2 weeks or getting Quarantined at home for 2 weeks unpaid. Or possibly spreading this thing for travel that wasn't necessary. 100% get all the reasons why but still super-bummed as we were really looking forward to this trip.
"Due to fly from UK to LV on 25th. We were then heading straight off to Page, Monument Valley, GCNP, DVNP and 3 nights in LV.Our problem is that the USA are still accepting flights from the UK.The FCO/WHO have not said we cannot travel to the USA.Therefore we will lose around £1500 if we cancel as insurance won’t cover us just because we don’t want to go."
"People are more likely to catch this virus as they go about their daily routine within their surrounding home city &/or regional area to which they reside at. Anyone who quite honestly does believe that their chances of contracting the virus be in flight &/or while in Vegas is easily fooled or just plain transparent.Post #119 - In regards to your personal concern(s) within your post. You could potentially contract this virus w/o ever traveling to Vegas, infecting (unbeknownst) other folks whom you visit &/or come close in contact with; be relatives, neighbors, friends, or random acquaintances. The thing about that is, one really doesn't know."
chantelbooth - can you risk not being able to get back home if flights cancel or being Quarantined in the States? Can you risk being Quarantined at home 2 weeks if-when you get back home? It's lost $ but will be lots more if you can't get home.

We're supposed to fly out tonight. Airline won't refund only reschedule. My mom came to visit just to watch the kids for us and she won't reschedule and wants us to still go. I'm so torn on what to do! I'm mostly concerned about travel bans once we get there preventing us from returning home.
"There are more cases in the city we fly out of than in Vegas. We are supposed to fly out Monday. If we do decide to go, it will be an interesting trip for sure."
"Nope not going to cancel, going in 2 months and hope things are open then.I understand people's reasons for cancelling, but I'll see what happens closer to the time."
"""Anyone who quite honestly does believe that their chances of contracting the virus be in flight &/or while in Vegas is easily fooled or just plain transparent.""There's so much wrong with this sentence, not just the odd use of ""transparent."" One thing I guess he's suggesting is that people don't get sick on vacation only at their home city."
"Cancelled our trip to Las Vegas Wednesday. We were scheduled to leave Friday, March 13. Cancelled reservations at Bally's, tour of Red Rock Canyon, and put tickets, to see Rod Stewart, on Ticketmaster. Hated to cancel because I have wanted to see Rod for so long, but health is more important."
Scheduled to fly out on May 10th. Last night for the first time my wife asked if we should still go. Going to see how things go for the next few weeks. As of today I still plan on going but that could change easily if things get worse. Hopefully not though. Stay safe all and don't touch your face.
"Let's see if Rod cancels. He, by his age, is in the most at risk group."
"Sadly me! We were taking my 84 up mother-in-law to see Rod Stewart. Dr said NO! We were able to get hotel refund, airline credit. Sadly we have to eat the 1k worth of concert tickets. I need Caesars to cancel it before tomorrow!!!"
I don’t mean to be a jerk so if it comes off that way I apologize. Leave granny at home. And when things get better take her somewhere special. I agree that she shouldn’t go. Have someone look after her when you are gone. I am sure she wants all to have a good time. Smart people do it all the time leaving their kids at home.
"""One thing I guess he's suggesting is that people don't get sick on vacation only at their home city.""I'd never stated nor suggested that. One can become ill either in their hometown, or while on vacation. But then again as usual, just the typical & most snarly everyday posted remarks directed towards TA members who post on the forum."
"""Anyone who quite honestly does believe that their chances of contracting the virus be in flight &/or while in Vegas is easily fooled or just plain transparent.”""I'd never stated nor suggested that. One can become ill either in their hometown, or while on vacation""Sorry, though your sentence is quite convoluted it sure sounds like you said they can't get it on an airplane or in Las Vegas. However, I still trying to understand your use of the word ""transparent"" so perhaps I didn't understand anything you wrote."
Once the NCAA tournament was cancelled so was my annual March Madness trip. Killed me to pull the plug on it but I simply no longer have any reason to go. So depressing.Best of luck to all who are choosing to carry on!
"Just under 7 wks. until my Vegas trip comes up. For the time being, going to sit patiently along the sidelines to find out which particular direction this virus is headed."
"I’m in process of trying to cancel. My flight is easy but I’m waiting on my hotel, which is a non refundable rate from Vegas.com. Supposed to leave 3/16 with 2 kids staying at Mirage. I also have show tickets that were only a few hundred bucks so if that’s all I lose I’m ok with that. We are all so disappointed and my vacation time isn’t flexible. But, we live with an elderly person with chronic conditions and with all the closures and uncertainty, I don’t want to risk it."
Not yet. Going to NYC and Vegas from April 1st to April 10th. Waiting to see what´s going to happen during the next couple of weeks.
"not cancelling unless Canadian or US border closed down. Leaving March 23rd, meeting my friends from US ere."
I'm not cancelling unless forced to either. Supposed to get married March 27 and my fiance lives in AZ
Irishfan def would stay away. They are actually on lockdown as we speak. No visitors and that’s in Wilmington delaware.
“ Irishfan def would stay away. They are actually on lockdown as we speak. No visitors and that’s in Wilmington delaware.“Huh??
"We were supposed to go out today and we cancelled late last night. I was so bummed, I was all packed and we were checked in on our flights but everything seems like it is being canceled around us. This whole situation is so crazy and surreal but it is what it is. The world will still be here when this is all over and we will carry on with our lives...."
I have not and will not cancel my plans for May!
"#155I don't blame you, May is way off. We literally made the call to cancel last night for today's trip."
Leaving April 8th. As of right now just waiting to see what happens. Hoping we can still go.
“Our problem is that the USA are still accepting flights from the UK.” - Not for long. President is currently addressing our nation and the rapidly increasing cases in the UK over the last 24 hours will have them added to the ban list. 13
Irishfan I thought you were asking if I would stay away from moms nursing home... sry. Was just answering if you were asking. I must of miss read it. My minds going crazy as of now. Lol
I haven't been to Vegas in 20 years and wouldn't you know it my Brother surprised me with a trip to Vegas for my 60th in May. Suppose to fly out May 10th. Fingers crossed that I won't have to cancel.Stay healthy and well everyone!
"Well British Airways have now offered a refund voucher for our trip which can be used towards another trip to anywhere in the world as long as the new flight departs within a year of our initial flight. Due to that I decided to go ahead and cancel.I have managed to cancel nearly everything but have lost around $70 from The View Hotel Monument Valley as they charge a 25% cancellation fee.So I am going to let the dust settle for a few months and this then look at maybe early October instead. It’s a lot hotter then as well.So for now farewell to a Nevada, Utah, Arizona and California. Hope to see you later in the year for a road trip."
We finally cancelled for April 15-21st. Was coming with a pregnant woman and an 80 year old. We are going to try and make it the first week of June.
I didn’t cancel. in fact I came out here spur the moment today. I couldn’t pass up a $38 flight out of Cleveland and a comped room at Caesars.
"I also have comped rooms at Caesars Palace with all my food, spa and incidentals. But, I decided to cancel my trip today because with numerous cancelation of shows, restaurants, and MGM resorts shutting down all spas, salons and gyms, it is a matter of time that CET follows. There is no fun in playing by myself in an empty casino."
"Was about to go on Sunday but had to cancel not because of the virus but because all the shows, events and places I like in vegas are shut down and I dont wanna sit in an overpriced room for a week doing nothing"
What do you suppose the prices will be like once it's over? Las vegas will see its biggest business loss in history in the next few months. Will an average person even be able to go there with the prices theyll set ? I can see this ending up with them having historically high prices
"We haven't cancelled our late April/early May trip yet but that is only because we booked non-refundable airfare. We'll wait to find out if the flight itself is cancelled so we can use the value of what we paid on a future flight. Room was comped and car wasn't prepaid so no issues there. I was supposed to fly out of our regional airport, Everett, to another regional airport, Springfield/Branson, a few days ago but all the flights (roundtrip) were cancelled by United. Hoping for the same in April."
Sad to say we will be cancelling our April 1 - 8th trip to Vegas. I was so looking forward to coming back to Vegas. We are just postponing so as soon as this thing dies down we will make some plans to visit my happy place. Our Canadian government as asked that all non-essential travel be cancelled which I think is the right thing to do considering how quickly this damn virus is spreading. :(
As of today our trip is still a go. We fly in late Monday night - watching cdc reports and closure list...unless something huge happens I believe we’ll be at slot machine before midnight on Monday
"At least you will have your choice of slot machines, so that’s a plus"
We are to embark on our trip to on March 20th and yes we are seriously considering canceling or trip as of today. Very disappointed!!!!!!!!
"Booked for end of April and have tickets for Lady Gaga show. If she’s coming, so are we."
"We're booked for 7th April, 16 nights at the Bellagio, but it's looking likely that the travel ban will be extended to the UK and that will stop us coming.Otherwise we expect to go ahead with our trip. However, if we do have to cancel, everything we've booked can either be cancelled with a full refund or hasn't been paid for.We're aware of the risks and will keep away from groups of people and wash our hands regularly to reduce our chances of getting it. Just as we've been doing for the last few weeks anyway!"
"We've had to cancel our trip leaving March 21 from Vancouver BC or face a 14 day isolation on return. We had NHL tickets, no problem cancelling those, and we have tickets to Rod Stewart March 21st - I can't believe Caesar's isn't cancelling shows yet - crazy!"
I was due to fly in 10 days. Booked with travel agency.Now that uk is banned are you sure about the refund? Or is it just option to re book
"Yep, 77 yrs old with a 76 year old bride who has Parkinsons. Just don't feel we can chance it."
"Sadly we did. Having to eat tonight’s Rod Stewart tickets. Caesars canceled all the shows AFTER this weekend. I guess the still want our $$ regardless of risk. We were to take my 84 yo mother in law. She rightly canceled. Then we’re taking adult kids. They canceled due concerns of illness causing missed work. Husband decided at 60 with health issues, he shouldn’t go. $700 down the strain!"
"Hubby and I go to Vegas for March Madness every year, we’re scheduled to leave the 17th and come back the 24th. We decided to cancel when the tournament was canceled. We were bummed since it’s one of our favorite trips every year but with no tournament, no other sports going on, and now news of restaurants, bars, pools, spas, etc closing we are happy we made the call. We’d rather use our vacation time to go at a later date when it’ll be more enjoyable."
Not cancelled trip yet and it is April 3 daughter getting married we are driving
I won't be going on my late April trip. Our govt just announced a mandatory 14 day self quarantine on return from overseas. Will wait to see what United Airlines announces re tickets back and forth to USA and hopefully won't lose any money on it.
You won’t loose money on United. They allowed me to cancel with zero change fees
"Just cancelled my trip for next week (Mar 23) and re-booked for July 4 weekend. My wife and I were all set, but the decision to cancel was made for us due to everything shutting down. It actually works out well because we were planning a July trip anyway. The flight is half the original cost (Southwest) and we have enough remaining credit to book another flight. Just hoping everything returns to normal by July. I might be out the cost of show tickets because it hasn't been canceled (yet) and I didn't get the insurance (I never do). But, I expect it to be cancelled sometime this week."
We cancelled this morning...Originally we were going to do the grand canyon and Vegas the first week of April we'd been discussing cancelling the last 10 days or so but once we were notified the shows we had booked had been cancelled the decision was much easier. We are looking at rescheduling for July. Hopefully things have settled down by then.
"""loose money"" hahaha"

"My wife and I, an elderly couple living in California, prepaid for a five day stay in early April (a month from now) in order to attend a family wedding in Kona. We advised the owners that we had to cancel our travel plans due to coronavirus concerns. The wedding plans have been cancelled. During the still-evolving course of this pandemic, public health authorities advise all to avoid large gatherings and unnecessary air travel. Our airline granted us a credit. We also had booked several additional nights stay subsequently at a property in Volcano, Hawaii, which graciously refunded our deposit. Nonetheless, the owners of this property in Captain Cook flatly refused to refund any part of our $845 advance payment. Perhaps now they can double down and earn twice as much re-renting the space for the same dates.... Buyer beware."
"I'm really trying to be optimistic.Wuhan China was in lock-down at the end of January and a few days ago, they were back to normal...borders open, makeshift hospitals gone, people ordered back to work, factories up and running, kids in parks playing, etc.Obviously what is going on here will get worse before it gets better but HOPEFULLY we can all be back to normal in 6 - 8 weeks too...or much sooner!I haven't cancelled my May trip yet...hopefully I won't have to. :)"
"My semi educated guess, as have hospital insights, peaking in 4-6 weeks,unlikely back to normal in 6-8 weeks, though restrictions will be lifted"
"My trip is cancelled for the end of March, Was going for a wedding and it was cancelled, So many things will be closed anyway by end of March, maybe even domestic flights."
"haven't canceled my april 5-9 trip to aria/cosmo yet. i'm not super hopeful that casinos will be back open by then, so my next opportunity to go will be june. already have wynn booked for june 20-24."
We are scheduled to go at the end of Aoril. At this time not sure that there will be any restaurants open or even shows.Crazy world right now!
Cancelled April 8-11. Whatever is still open in Vegas clearly won't be soon. Its more likely we will be quarantined in our own houses than it is realistic to make that trip. I will reschedule for the Fall.

"#198,Advertising is not allowed."
"I am canceling and rebooking constantly, eventually its going to get back to normal in Vegas. So far I just can not beat the rates. I am thinking May 1st for Vegas opening up."
"I am delaying the decision to cancel my Apr. 29th trip to Vegas for 6 nts. As time approaches closer forward, I'll then elect to cancel if this virus (at that time) doesn't bug itself out."
Virgin Australia have cancelled my flights for end of May so that was the nail in the coffin for us...we have got a credit to use within 12 mths. I would of loved to be able to book again but I’m gonna wait to see how this play outs over the next month or so. End August/September would be preferred if not it will be a fall/winter trip. :(
Cancelled my early may trip and moved it to july
"Wyndham Grand Desert cancelled our reservation for Apr 6-10 and refunded our money.I am the weirdo who goes to Las Vegas to ride mountain bikes, go kayaking or hiking. Closed buffets and casinos don't bother me at all."
"I am waiting to cancel my trip booked for the end of April. IF (sorry DTC....I know you don't like caps and !!), things are normalizing by then I may go. If not, I am fine waiting.More concerning is the money I paid for an Orlando ticket the week after.....that event is cancelled.....hotel cancelled my ressie as they are staying closed, BUT Delta has not updated the no change fee past April yet."
"I'm still holding off on cancelling my trip for the end of April. It feels like a whirlwind of changes this past week, so I don't want to make a decision without seeing how things play out within the next couple of weeks. I had a plan B trip in mind to go to Canada, but than the border closed, so now everything is up in the air at this point. Might move the trip to July if nothing is normalized until this summer."
We did scheduled April 14-18-will be back
Looking at 2021 now.
I think once the media starts realizing its nothing more than another strain of the flu. The whole scare will be over and back to normal.I am going to rebook my trip to Vegas for May 19th. If I need to cancel and rebook not a big issue.
Lance you’re a complete idiot in denial Shame on you
the Kaaihue family thanks you for uour comment
I am sorry but its just another Democratic State comment. This is exactly what the Democrats want. Socialism. I have been a Democrat for over 30 yrs but I do not want socialism in the US and that is what we are going to get if we continue to believe the media. Good bye freedom of speech and everything we live by. Socialism is coming and you better be prepared. Government is going to rule us and its not going to be pretty
"So Lance, you'll be giving back the $1000 check that the government will be sending you...the emergency socialism.Edited: 12:08 am, March 22, 2020 "
"It’s not about becoming a socialist country, it’s about making sure our healthcare workers don’t get overwhelmed and ill themselves from this “flu”, as you called it.Suck it up and stay home for a couple weeks, Lance, and be a good human being. It isn’t a big deal to do your part for the greater good of the community."
"Lance Do you understand economics. Do you know the single most important thing that was done to prevent a depression 11 years ago? Do you understand how economic stimulus works? It has nothing to do with socialism it all has to do with spending. You pump a trillion dollars in the economy, people spend, jobs are created and the government on all levels recoup taxes. President Obama did it to pull us out of the recession . And George W Bush did it a couple times also.Edited: 12:40 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Vance...the Dems are soundly rejecting Bernie so what are you talking about,you need to stay informed."
"Lance is just selfish, all about him...so sad..."
"Cancelled 4/29-5/5 tri[p and rescheduled now for 9/4- 9/9. Soooo hoping we can make that one. I NEED a vacation. We have a camper at a campground in northern MN and, though I love it there, I still have to pack, unpack, cook and clean. Our one trip to Vegas for usually 5 days is MY one and only vacay in a year."
Cancelled 5/19 to 5/22 and rescheduled for a month later. I really need to Decompress and Vegas is my Decompressor

"The wedding I was going to in late March was cancelled, I'm waiting for the bride to reschedule, she's hoping for late August to early September. We were able to cancel the hotel and couple of activities we had booked and get money back. Got credit from the airline."
"""'Nj Gov Murhpy - The executive order he signed Wednesday will keep it in place through at least June 5, the governor’s office said., Another 30 days at home. """"I will be canceling end of May Trip to LV . Probably would have faced some type of Airline or LV Restrictions anyway, Significant part of our Vegas Expectations included Buffets, which will probably not be back in operations until 2021 ( if then). Still hoping for some type of planned trip in September, but social distancing procedures to be implemented will probably result in our cancelling our Sept Trip AlsoOur May Trip Airline reservations included combination of reward miles and no refund tickets which we will have to get different type Credits from United.

"I had two trips (April, May) that I scheduled last year but canceled when LV shut down in March. I have an August trip to Bellagio and Palazzo still scheduled that I'm keeping for now. Those are free offers so I can be on wait n see mode till summer."
I haven’t (planning on a November trip) but my husband’s coworker cancelled his. He was supposed to go next week
I was supposed to be there right now. Haven't re-booked as everything is too uncertain. They gave me a credit towards another flight in the future. I so hope America gets it's act together so we can go back and visit again sometime soon!
"Yes, canceled May 5 trip to Vegas and have rebooked for late June. Also have late August Vegas booked. Then late October to Bahamas. And, finally Jan 1, 2021 for a month snowbirding in Florida, and a month of February travel to Lake Tahoe and points in between, then home. I hope to do all. I figure if I keep moving, 19 won't catch me."
"phoensam, you've previously mentioned Australia's COVID infection rate compared to other countries. Isn't the population of Australia something like 1/10 that of the USA? It's easier to get and keep acts together (for any issue) when the population is relatively small."
"cushionz1, yes it is about 1/10th the population of America.....so if you multiply our deaths by 10, America should come in at less than 1000 deaths to date. The state I live in has the city of Sydney in it, which has over 5 million people.....and a major port for cruise ships. The difference clearly is how it was managed and the community's attitude towards the value of their own lives and the lives of others. We remain shut down, those who lost employment or business (by 30%) are getting $750/week.....though we only had 3 positives with over 10 000 tests in the last 24 hours. We are reopening slowly. Our government has put us in a position where we will avoid the economic devastation and loss of life America has endured and will need to continue to endure. Listen to the experts.....had Trump done that, we could all be thinking about taking our Vegas trips sooner rather than later."
"After Michael Moore spoke, I have cancelled all.https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/michae…Hunt"
"OTOH, maybe this will ring true? https:/…never-let-crisis-go-wasteJust saying,Hunt"
"“” It's easier to get and keep acts together (for any issue) when the population is relatively small.””Just as important is the geographic isolation of Australia...and most of their population is in suburban type settings, much easier to isolate. They don’t have a New York or London type environment to deal with., and as we have seen most of Americans in rural areas have had relatively easy experiences so far with Covaid 19 and it remains to be seen if the virus infection will increase as they enter winter season in Australia"
"Although I didn't actually have anything booked, I was definitely looking at returning to LV around November time this year before all this happened. Have now scrapped that idea altogether.I usually go to Vegas in Feb/March time as it's not too hot then & I'm not a big lover of the baking heat tbh so that time of year suits me fine. Due to being really unwell since October last year & needing an operation on my spine & afterwards losing a quarter of my body weight (4 stone) in a period of just 4 months due to all the very strong medication I was on & a total lack of appetite , I just wasn't up to travelling by that time, so my thinking was I'd just do the sensible thing & hold off until later in the year until I was feeling much better & go around Thanksgiving time which I've done in the past.Quite honestly, what with everything going on in the world right now, I've scrapped plans for any type of 'big trips' to America etc any time soon ; I've totally written off 2020 now. These are far from the normal times we all know & take for granted usually, so you've got to use a bit of common sense I think. Where I was unwell for so long, apart from more recently being able to take the dog out for a walk, going at like 5am before most people are even up and so therefore I've avoided really seeing anyone else, I've haven't actually been out to my local town centre to get shopping in over 3 months now (when all this really started to sort of get serious here in the UK), as I was & still am tbh, pretty cautious about catching something after being poorly & laid up for so long (after my operation, I spent 23 weeks going to my local GP surgery to see the nurses on a daily basis for dressing changes etc). Other things like the thought of maybe having to wear gloves and masks on a 10 hour international flight from the UK to the USA & maybe having to wear the same wherever you go when on your travels, especially in that Vegas heat, doesn't appeal to me one bit. Like I said, I usually go to LV around February or March time, and I know it's a long way off, but the way things are going I'm not even holding my breath about doing a Vegas trip for that time of year in 2021 yet. Hopefully I'm wrong.Just me personally, but I'd just sooner wait until next year when everybody knows more & hopefully things are starting to get back to normal by then. If I was to go this year and certain things are closed or unavailable to me , like day trips or shows or the many different exciting activities I like to do etc - nobody knows how it's all going to pan out at this stage - then, IMO, it becomes a bit of a half hearted trip & I definitely wouldn't get that 'full-on Vegas experience' that I usually have. If it means waiting a while before I can get that 'full-on experience' that I usually have when I'm in town, then so be it.Also what with me living in the UK, I think there will certain travel restrictions in place for a fair while yet for anybody overseas, so even if I still wanted to go this year, the final decision might just be taken out of my hands in that way anyway. So, in my personal circumstances at least - what with living in the UK and my recent health problems amongst other things - the wise decision to make, I believe, is very much to put everything on hold.Sending my best wishes to everyone on the LV forum at these strange times. Take care, AdamEdited: 3:57 am, May 07, 2020 "
"Bf and I were talking about Vegas yesterday. We are going in Sept and more than happy to comply with the new rules. We hope most will be up and running but if not, at least we're out of the house"
"himain Denver, Colorado,After long shut down here in NJ, we are also hoping that we will be able to make our Sept Trip. Getting out of the house and traveling would be great.

Chico-I hear you. We are going via Southwest and will wear our masks. I will bring wipes to wipe things down but we are not that concerned. You can do everything you can to protect yourself and still get it. At some point you have to realize that somethings are out of your control!
"gatesy, that sounds like quite a serious op. Glad to hear you're on the mend, and I echo salty's good wishes.Like you, I've pretty much ruled out any foreign travel for 2020. Hopefully by 2021 we'll all be in a better position as far as this damned virus is concerned, but we'll see.Edited: 10:53 am, May 07, 2020 "
I talked to my California friend last night to inform him that I am unofficially cancelling my annual Vegas plans to meet him and his wife in Vegas for 10/4.However will keep my hotel reservations at least for now.
"Hiya Jam, nope not done it yet myself. The app only became active from today I believe. Over 30 thousand people have already downloaded it though according to our local paper. We've all had a leaflet come in the post that explains everything & what to do next etc.Here's a link to our local IOW paper website with more info about it if you fancy a read -https://www.countypress.co.uk/I'll probably give it a few days & wait to hear opinions from people before I go ahead and decide whether to do it or not.Regards, Adam"
"Changed our trip from June 9 to August 1, hopefully we will get to come! We are booked at the Wynn for this trip"
Aussie here with planned trip to LV in Mid OctoberAs most would be aware Australia is doing well at this stage for a variety of reasons not the least being strong bipartisan leadership at the top and across states . Yes it is much easier here than NYC for eg but we have had other measures like a tracing app in place for weeks - over 5 million downloads alreadyFull domestic interstate travel is expected by July but International travel remains a long way off and of course is a two way street as you have to be allowed in and not do a two week quarantine period!At this stage I suspect in Australia we will be doing well in October but Qantas still wont be flying to LA ergo my trip is screwed .
Mine was for end of June...cancelled :-(

"Not cancelled yet, but thinking about it. I assume that the Canada/USA border may be opening before other international travel is allowed, although I’m not sure if they can even do that. Our flights are booked for Sept 3-7, but instead of cancelling myself, I’m hoping the airline will be cancelling on us.Also, if we still have to self-isolate for two weeks upon return, we’re not going for sure."
"I cancelled a trip for June and rebooked for August. I also have a back up trip planned for November (unable to travel in September or October). I'm really hoping for August though! One day at a time, I guess."
"Still have my Sept Trip ( cancelled May) planned, but not too encouraged about what might be available if we do get there. Actively reading comments about LV openings ."

"We have Wynn reserved for May 26-30th on Wynn rewards. I'll lose a portion of points if I cancel. I see they are hoping to open by Memorial Day. If that does come true I'm happy to lose my points. I will not be a guinea pig with such limited activities and options. Not realistic for a tourist, I can imagine locals enjoying. Everything else is cancel with full refunds. Not going, but I'm hoping to get all of my credits back."
