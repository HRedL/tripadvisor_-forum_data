"I am considering a trip to Barbados, on Air Canada flight on July 30th, which leaves in the morning.The protocols say you have to upload your COVID-19 test results 24 hours before you leave on your flight.If your results can be no more than 72 hours old, does that mean I would need to receive the results within 48 hours, in order to upload the document in time.What happens if you don't get the results in time, but before you land in Barbados, you receive them? Will the test be considered valid? Or would you have to do the test at the airport?I'm hoping some Canadians who have already landed can accurately answer my question."
"mel2007 you are flying on good day to be able to get the closest thing to a guarantee that you will get a test in time (Thursday allows for a full three working days beforehand to get the test). I had a party which landed on the AC flight - they did not have their test results when they got on the plane but received them when they landed! It did not matter and they went through fine and with no problem. I did see that the protocols said ""from 15th July"" to upload them. So it will be different from today (maybe!). But it did not actually say you had to. It's still a bit of a grey area unless anyone else has info which applies from today (15th)."
As of last Friday there is a rapid one hr test approved by Health Canada.https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/mobile/health-c…
"A rapid test is not part of the protocols, it has to be a PCR tes done by an approved lab in Ontario.Results anywhere from 24 hours to 7 or 8 days."
"Mel ...It is described as a SARS-COV-2 Real-Time RT PCR test I may be wrong but I would have thought the PCR bit implies it is OK If the machine / lab that process the test is ISO 15189 rated then I would think it ie acceptable Really great news if this is the case ..,could resolve a lot of issues!!!"
This rapid PCR test could be a game changer. Since it has been approved all the studies for accuracy and sesnsitivity relative to the standard PCR test have been done. So it us as good as the reference method but faster and requires less technical knowledge. It will greatly reduce the turn around time and should improve tracing and isolation procedures. The methodology is what Barbados has specified but since it may be used like a PoC test (think glucometer) it will be up to Barbados to accept the new technology or not. I can't see why they wouldn't.It can process 9 tests in 1 hour but I guarantee they are working on increasing the number of tests that can processed and in less time. This is something that could be used in an airport setting.
NC ...thanks for that Have you looked into the ISO 15189 rating of this company / test
If this test is Ok it looks like what all the islands and tourists have been praying for (I know I have) and will make travelling an easy possibility once again.
Not yet Mdp. Because they are not a clinical medical lab they may not be ISO 15189 compliant.Yes we were just talking about how we would be tested either at our home airport or connection airport (Toronto) and the timing. It sure would make a difference. It will be up to Barbados.
"I think it would be the medical lab using the kit that would be ISO compliant. The gov't, airport airline etc. could contract out to Dynacare or Lifelabs here in Ontario and they would be the one to set up a testing facility at the airport for screening. They are and would have to be USO 15189 compliant. The company says it is about $100.00CDN/test as it now. That will go down. Promising..."
"I wonder what the timing is in rolling out this new test, and if it will be accepted worldwide.Likely, not until sometime next year.FYI - Any vaccine that may become available next year will likely only be another layer in the fight against COVID-19. You probably will still have to physically distance, and wear a mask for the next few years. This was discussed by Canadian researchers this week."
Mel the kits are ready being shipped to First Nations and parts of Northern Ontario.
Mel if a vaccine gives you adequate immunity (something to be determined) why would you have to follow the distancing mask etc.? Maybe they won't know how long the immunity lasts but what's wrong with a booster or annual shot like a flu shot until something better comes along? That is better than living like this.
Another report...https://www.thestar.com/business/2020/07/09/…
"NC ...this report says """"Tests are conducted by a licensed lab technician in any location,""""....so if the lab is ISO rated - I guess the technician will be.... ?????Does he or she travel with the test kit ????"
"Yes Mdp. Let's say Dynacare gets the contract from Pearson airport to do testing on passengers, crew and staff. Dynacare would set up a ""specimen collection centre"" (SCC) at an entrance to the airport. All passengers flying intetnational would go through the SCC, be tested and then either wait for results or move on to checkin depending on what the airport wants. Waiting produces a near virus free zone if only neg are allowed to check in, otherwise it is same as outside. The lab staff sent to collect and perform the test would be Dynacare staff following Dynacare procedures so yes the SCC/satellite lab at the airport would be ISO 15189 compliant same as main lab. Yes it adds even more time at the airport but some will get their tests offsite, reducing the volume to be done at the airport. We got used to security screening after 9/11, we'll get used to this."
As is being discussed in other topics ... this will not 'catch' those who are just infected but as yet do not have sufficient antigens to register on a test It will however speed up the process considerably and be more up o date than a test carried out 72 hours before departure
Hi Canby - I too found the PM/DPM's comments reassuring - borders stay closed and all international travel restrictions stay in place for now!
Well if nothing changes for internationl travel then if we go to Barbados for our return all we have to do is a 14 day quarantine after making our connection... no testing within 72 hours or at BGI before departure or at YYZ on arrival. That is nothing worse than what we did in March. His hands are tied with Trump. Kind of hard to open up to some countries but not the States.
"I do think that by sometime in the Fall there will be testing available at or near airports with results available in plenty of time for many flights. They already tell us to get to the airport 2-3 hours before your flight. So if testing was available before you checked baggage or went through security, you could get a test result before you took off. They should even be able to send the results directly wherever you are supposed to send them. I think a lot of this will work itself out in a few months. Don't expect it to be free."
