Unbelievable!! Hard to believe that people who are supposed to be representatives of responsible government can say things about Cuba that are so outrageously false. God help us all!! God help Cuba.https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-dad…Terry

"Obviously, I find it hard to believe that any government would attempt biological warfare these days. Any government would have to be unbelievably stupid to do such a thing.Certainly, it is not something Cuba would do, given their reputation for offering medical and other assistance to many parts of the world. Even including USA in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.The problem in Florida is mainly a result of the stupidity of some people in Florida clustering together on the beaches and so on, in direct defiance of the advice of the health experts.I just hope there still enough intelligent Americans left that will resist drinking the Kool-Aid."
"Jack - indeed, some parts kept their beaches open for Spring break. The major of the City if Miami recently asked that Miami airport be closed to all flights. Cuba has stopped theirs but there continue to be flights from other places."
"The State of Florida's response has been similar to the US Federal response, a bit slow, indecisive, and deferring key closure decisions to local officials. The Feds left key decisions to the states. The Florida governor punted the key closure decisions down to the counties. Florida Governor DeSantis looks to Trump for guidance. Remember when there was the controversy about the cruise ship with CV infection on board docking at Port Everglades (Ft. Lauderdale) DeSantis looked to Trump to make the key decision. Ultimately local authorities made the key decision. Some counties in FL have strict stay at home policies while others are very loose. Beaches are a good example. DeSantis would never rule churches being open, also leaving that to local authorities.Florida's large numbers of low paid, unskilled, agricultural and tourism workers many of which are immigrant results in large numbers of people living in crowded conditions and with substandard health care. Sadly this group has been hit especially hard by COVID19.."
Glad to see they put your post back Terry .The best thing TA could do is do something about these people that have nothing better to do then get posts close .Jack there are many Americans that continue drinking the Kool-Aid from there Government keeps feeding them . Nothing will change from the land of the free as they like to call themselves they know what is good for everybody around the World ..Anyway we will never see a change from the Bullies South of the border not in my life time for sure .
"Cheers gat0. I think in this time of uncertainty, the last thing on earth anyone of us needs is to have our freedom of expression isolated too, especially by a small band of narrow minded people on this forum.I watched the 2 hour PBS American Experience 1918 Influenza program the other day... below is just a tid-bit of that program available on YouTube. When watching it, I found it uncanny how that terrible time in the world's history could mirror so much of what we're now seeing happening today. The old adage comes to mind... ""those who forget the lessons of the past are condemned to repeat them"". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFJPDqKPgcTerryEdited: 1:16 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"Thanks, Terry. I watched that one too. If anything, it sounds like that epidemic was even worse than what is happening now. That gives me some hope that we can come out of this."
"Florida Governor DeSantis is an absolute idiot. First he didn't shut the Florida beaches down anywhere near the timeline he should have and now this ..,https:/…"
Holato bad they have not come up with a pill to fix Stupidity....
He's not the only one.https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-canada…
"You know, after reading that link posted @9, it becomes increasing difficult to not only remain respectful of certain political representatives in the US, but to not lump them in with the other representatives of their affiliated political party as being nothing more than a bunch of morons. I read this morning that 54+ % of republican party representatives feel there would be no problem with returning things to normal on May 01st in the US, reopening up the economy with everyone returning to work and the kids returning to school. I was also shocked to read that 23% of democrat representatives feel the same way. However I challenge any of those individuals regardless of their political stripes to be the first ones to lead the way out of self-isolation in advance of anyone else. Of course none of them will, but how easy it is for them to play God with the life and death of all others they claim to represent. Totally irresponsible. Meanwhile it's reported that 80% of the American public across the country feel that May 01st is far too early. Under current conditions, nobody is going to answer the bell, so why bother even trying to set a date?TerryEdited: 3:41 pm, April 12, 2020 "
As soon as the govt finds a way to manipulate the numbers or the facts we will be back to work.
The link in 11 doesn't work.
That sucks. Not sure why.https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-canada…
It works on the otc forum.Very strange indeed.
Basically says a new test kit has been developed and made in Canada. It is being sold and used in other countries but not here since it is still under review.They say they are studying it as to the best way to use it. How about right away that works for me.
"Elected politicians don't say things like this unless they have calculated that the majority of their supporters will agree. (No offense Bob, I didn't say ""all"") A politician's primary goal is to stay in office and these idiots think that this will further that goal. Says a lot about the state of Florida."
True politicians look out for number one.It is somewhat hard to grasp however that there could be that many uneducated people in one place.Attn: All Floridians your elected representative thinks you are all stupid.
Here's the link to the link from ratwalto:https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g1-i965…
"""It is somewhat hard to grasp however that there could be that many uneducated people in one place.""You've never been to Florida, have you?"
Thanks Jack I was hoping someone would come to my recuse.
I guess I thought it was a local thing and not state wide. lmao.
"Come-on people, knowing what 'the world' knew about Donald Trump prior to the election...Yet 62,979,879 people still voted for him.It is obvious there has been a crisis sweeping the US long before COVID - 19..It is called ..IGNORANCE.. and sadly no one is working on a vaccine to prevent that condition."
"HA!! Nobody could have said it better than that, Pat! Amen!Terry"
"There seem to be various numbers quoted, depending on the source - I don't know why that is. You would think somebody could count correctly. Nevertheless, the number Pat mentions is close to most other sources.According to Wikipedia, 62,984,828 (not significantly different from Pat's number) voted for Trump, and 65,853,514 voted against him.So the ignorance isn't quite universal, but the US election system doesn't seem to guarantee that the majority selects the president."
Holaare we any different here.....the guy in power got less votes....If my memory is correct...cheers.
"I agree, Rich, but we don't try to pretend that we have a direct election of our Prime Minister."
Holavery truecheers.
the 3rd world Miamians will say anything to hurt cuba. all the while they have turned Miami into not much more than cuba.
"Cuba Jack: I think the significant number here is that more US citizens did not bother to vote than voted for either Trump or Clinton. If non-US'ers say ""shame on you"" I can only bow my head in shame. My only consolation is that I did the best I thought I could but it wasn't enough."
