"Hi There,My wife and I have flights and four nights accommodation in Reykjavik next week.We are still unsure about cancelling. I know it is q constantly changing situation but I was trying to get an idea of how things are at the moment. I know there are 100+ cases now (mostly linked to visitors to the Alps/Northern Italy.We are a fit middle aged couple with no pre-existing medical conditions and would be taking sensible precautions regarding hand sanitation etc. Ours is a direct flight from Edinburgh.Are most of the attractions still open? are tours for the Golden Circle, Northern Lights etc still happening?.The other thing to consider is the fairly considerable cost of cancelling the trip without a good reason (island locking down etc). I know you can't put a price on your health but it is to be a consideration when deciding what to do. I am also aware of how the travel industry and the economy in Iceland will struggle if people just decide to stay away without good reason.A lot to consider. I'd be glad of your opinions"
"Right now the tours/sights etc. have not been affected yet afaik, but that could change quickly. Someone reported from Reykjavík saying that tours are going ahead, but places are quieter than usual, which is not necessarily a bad thing when visiting.There are lots of factors to consider: cost involved with cancelling and going ahead, personal risk, risk for others (friends, family) who are at a higher risk than you, effects of a possible quarantine (cost, job, family etc.I guess it's a very indidivual decision to make. The risk out in nature is probably less than for a city- or an events-based visit elsewhere."
"Thanks Kim,The reason I am trying to be positive is that we have jobs which will not be affected. We don't have family comittments and neither of us have health issues. I am tempted to visit and take sensible precautions. Obviously that decision would be made early next week as the situation is changing by the hourDavid"
"From what you are describing I would probably go, if you are in the low risk group yourselves and as long as the flights are still running."
"We all see things differently and I think that any holiday travel is unnecessary. As a visitor you do not know if you could be a carrier of the virus and bring it to Iceland and infect others, conversely you don’t know if you may bring it home with you. I feel we all have a responsibility to take reasonable measure not to spread this virus even more than it is. It’s easy to self isolate at home but if you are on holiday will you do that? Our government is now recommending that all those with a cough or temperature self isolate for 7 days. Would you do that in Iceland on holiday? Most probably not.I would cancel. I’ve cancelled 2 holidays and my next is in May which I will look at as the situation changes. Maybe cancelling this.Edited: 8:27 am, March 13, 2020 "
"I think Kim provided very good advice. In my case, after weighing all the different factors (many of which Kim has mentioned), I will be going. But then my individual circumstances may be different from yours. Good luck with your decision one way or another"
"Me and my partner are in pretty much an identical situation. We are due to fly to Reykjavik on the 18th so less than a week. We are both young and healthy with no children or real commitments. As far as we are concerned the only way we will be cancelling is if the government advise against travel or Iceland locks down similair to Italy etc. Obviously we will be taking extra precautions.. not spening so much time amongst crowds and regular hand washing etc but we still plan to do the tours we have booked ( Golden Circle, Northern Lights and Blue Lagoon). If these tours are stopped then we will try our best to make the best of a bad situation but we are still looking forward to it. Life goes on etc. Each situation is different I suppose and in the end regardless of how many people say you should or shouldn't go no one can make the decision for you ( exept maybe airlines and governments). Thats my input anyways.. Hopefully you'll have an amazing timeEdited: 8:51 am, March 13, 2020 "
"I would not go. There has just been announced ban on groups bigger than 100 people which will affect all kinds of business, also tourist. Schools are tuning down or closing and changing to online only. Of course you might be just fine and have a fun trip (after all, things are still pretty close to normal), but you might also experience chaos and even angry customer/people when they are not allowed to enter places because of the ban. If you are really unlucky you might also get infected or experience a quarantine because you might have been infected by someone, like f.x. another tourist as there are no restrictions on tourists so far, and no quarantine either, not even if they come from China or Italy."
Thanks for the update.The perfect solution would be for the Icelandic Government to close the island to all tourists. This way wouldn't lose our moneyI will keep an eye on the situation over the weekend and make a final decision on Monday.Thanks Again
I understand what you are saying and my wife probably agrees with you.If I cancel now without good reason I lose a large amount of money. This may not be a big deal to some but this will probably be the only holiday we can do this year. At present neither UK or the Icelandic government are restricting travel but obviously this could change. We would respect their decision. I plan to see what the situation is on monday and make a final decision then
"I think that if the Government closes the gates you don’t automatically get reimbursed. The airline, hotel and rental are still offering services ordered and paid for, but it’s you that’s incapable of travelling. This is why airlines are still flying with near-empty planes.In some ways the ban on public gatherings will have very limited effects on tourists. Even the largest tour-buses are under 100 people. Most sites are large enough for several groups of 100 people. You might have to wait to get to the ledge at Gullfoss, but maybe you are OK with enjoying the view 50 meters to the left. What I would worry about is what services will be totally stopped. Like will some restaurants close rather than rearrange tables to have a 2-meter radius. Will there be queues at museums, Harpa and comparable sites. Will a hostel at Hella where most have cancelled bother remaining open? Can you go out for a pint? And yes – of course the risk of a quarantine when you get home.But I suspect that the risk of catching the virus in Iceland might actually be lower than if you live and commute in a crowded city. When traveling you tend to mainly stick around the same people and even avoid the most congested areas."
"The risk while being in Iceland is probably lower. The risk while travelling, i.e. being on trains, coaches or planes or in airports together with large groups of people may well be higher than staying at home."
"Hi Gestar,Thanks for that, a really detailed reply.I have checked with my travel agent and they have confirmed if Iceland closes its borders we will be unable to fly and get to the hotel so we will be able to get a full refund. If Iceland remains open to visitors we will lose all our money if we cancel. Going to consider over the weekend"
If I am going next week. I would choose to reschedule at a later day even though it will cost me $150 USD to do the airfare change. I just came back home from Iceland a few days ago. I enjoyed my trip but noticed some people are coughing and sneezing during the the tours. I thought they should wear a mask. Good thing is that all my tours and hotel bookings are 24 hr canceling. I waited and decided to go ahead with only 1 case reported in Iceland at that time. Now is over 100 so the situation have gotten worst which I wouldn't feel comfortable to go anymore. This is a personal decision and depending how you feel and get ready for any situation that comes to you.
Scottyf1412.Don't know if it's the Geordie in me but I am with you fella. Obviously if the flight is cancelled it's taken out of our hands but then hopefully we don't end up out of pocket.Now I just need to get the wife onto my wavelength :-)
"Haha, yeah it must be. The way i see it is the same rules apply here that apply there.. be sensible and wash your hands. If the tours are cancelled but theres no warning from the FCO then cancelling would mean no refund...maybe im being stupid but in that scenario I would still rather go and see if i can make a half decent time out of it. The only place where I would say the risk is higher is the airport.. If Iceland has brought in a ban on public gatherings surely that means its safer to be there than the UK atm where no measures like that are in place. Obviously if travel is stopped and a full refund is offered then there is Pro's to that too but as of now I'm still going"
"I'm due to go on the 22nd and the ban on public gatherings bothers me. It appears this includes restrictions on numbers of people in bars and restaurants. I can't say fancy having to sit or stand two meters away from the wife whilst we have our evening meal and drinks. I can cancel my tours and get a refund, as well as my accommodation, but whilst EasyJet have removed the fees for changing a booking I can see that prices in the autumn when I'd be looking to go are extortionate now.I have this nagging worry about things taking a turn for the worse whilst we are there too so getting stranded or having to isolate ourselves in a hotel would be horrible."
Surely they cant be going to request that couples who have been together all day must be 2 meters apart at all times? It seems impractical since the same couple would be in close contact everywhere else other than in a bar/ restaurant. I understand keeping couples and groups away from other couples and groups but that would seem a bit pointless wouldnt it.. making a husband and wife sit 2 meters apart while eating only to then go back and share the same hotel room?
"I feel a bit of both; the desire to make the trip happen, if feasible, during the planned dates (early May) or at later period this year during the flight rebooking window--unless the prices of everything are sky-high.I wouldn't call it irresponsible, but we do need to play our part and contribute to the containment. I sincerely hope Greenland closes it's borders right now so it can remain pristine.Edited: 2:14 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"We are in a similar position with a trip planned for next weekend. Each person makes a personal choice and we will travel if travel is permitted. I do not consider our trip irresponsible. The UK has the right to ban overseas travel and Iceland has the right to ban foreign visitors. Neither of these situations have happened as yet and so at this time, travel is still deemed acceptable by both countries."
"You don't know any of the individual on this board and don't know their personal circumstances (age, health, preparation for the trip in regards to corona virus, family situation, plans after arrival and going home), I don't think it is possible to judge whether it is an irresponsible decision."
"Continuing to travel in these circumstances is irresponsible for so many reasons.You may bring the virus with you.you may pick it up while there and spread it as you travel.The country may be put into lockdown and then how will you get home? No planes in, no planes out.While you yourself may only have a mild case, hat about all whom you come in contact with?Australia has just advised against anyone travelling o/s anywhere - other countries will follow."
I think we are waiting to hear what the individual governments decide. If and when they say that iceland is on lock down(and let's agree that's why they are elected) we will all agree to stay at home. At the end of the day common sense should prevail
"India has done that kinda of. All the previously granted visas have been suspended for a month and those that need to enter the country for compelling reasons can contact the Indian Embassy. And everyone arriving from seven specific countries will/may be quarantined based on certain criteria. And Indians are strongly advised to refrain from traveling to those countries: China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany."
"And that’s the point. Each country is making its own decision. It’s not irresponsible to travel to a country who chooses to keep their borders open to overseas visitors. If Iceland welcomes us and our airline is still flying, so will we. Things are changing fast and we will respect the decision each country makes and react accordingly."
NickandAlex I agree 100%
Yeah NickandAlex and Dave I have to agree too.. Every individual can only really act on their own governments advice. All the people who are naming countries that have stopped all travel are expecting the citizens of said countries to abide by there measures.. surely if our goverment has deemed it safe to travel then not listning to there advice kind of defeats the point?
Scottyf1412 Might see you on a bar sometime next week. Mind you I am hearing rumours that the UK government is reconsidering shutting the UK down in the middle of next week. Watch this space.
"It doesn’t really matter what individual governments decide It’s just stupid to travel and risk spreading this virus.Some countries have banned travel, some haven’t - time will tell which ones got it right. Do you want to be the one who takes the virus to Iceland or the one who takes it from Iceland to your home?"
"I’ll decide for myself if it’s stupid to follow the medical advice of specialists and the direction provided by governments or stupid to follow the advice on an Internet forum. We each have our own opinions. If the Icelandic government don’t want me and others to travel, they will announce it and I will respect it. For now their message is their borders are open and travellers are welcome to Iceland."
"And it is unlikely just yet for Iceland or any other country to close its borders to the UK. It's not a hotbed. UK currently has almost 800 cases and if that crosses 3000 then maybe. I wonder if countries will add the US to their list soon, it now has close to 2300 cases but it's a big country with a higher population so maybe they'll wait till it hits 5000 (not that I want it to)."
"But do note that with a lower population compared to others, Iceland, with 134 cases, is worse than Italy--strictly statistically speaking.1. San Marino2. Iceland3. Italy4. Norway5. South Korea6. Denmark7. Iran"
I agree. The people who have paid large sums of money to visit a country that they have been excited about seeing for a long time are torn enough trying to make the decision to go or stay. They don't need to be called stupid by other forum folk . All we can do is follow the advice of the real experts which is what most of us are doing. We aren't stupid we arent irresponsible we just want to do the sensible thing without overreacting. Try to be nice guys
"So let’s put this another way. You live in the Uk and our NHS is over stretched. Would you be happy that intensive care beds are used by tourists who came to UK fell ill and needed that bed. A member of your family is ill and there is no bed. The same if you go to Iceland. With a small population their health service is small and I’m guessing stretched.Just because borders are open doesn’t mean we should be travelling. Much of this disease has been spread by tourists.I’ve got what I think is a common cold and have self isolated haven’t been out side the house, 3 days to go. Had I been on holiday would I have self isolated, I don’t know. It’s much easier to be at home and self isolate. My cold started over night, no warning sign so I could easily have been on holiday.So far 2 holidays cancelled and likely more. I feel I need to do my part in helping not to spread this Virus, either at home or abroad, and to help our NHS cope."
Everyone can probably find there own reason to justift either going or not going and at the end of the day the final choice will come down to you. Not people on here trying to convince you that their way is the total right way. As of now im still going and I plan on having a good time.
"And those who have decided to take the trip, do keep us updated on the situation there.What kind of screening procedures has Iceland put in place at the airport (and outside)? How long does it take? Are they checking for a combination of factors (fever and/or cough, etc..) before recommending/forcing a (self?) quarantine? How are people reacting when someone coughs (because there's absolutely no way an observer can tell if the cough was corona-induced or not)?Actually, I'm a bit surprised that Iceland has so far been a bit relaxed in their screening/quarantining of incoming travelers, at least I'm not able to find any information on it. For that matter even the UK seems relaxed, but you guys will know more about that, I'm not updated.But those travelling, be safe. If you have to be in a group, maybe wear marks. Maybe even carry a few gloves. You could probably share your preparedness plan so it will be useful for others and get suggestions.There's a graph (constantly updated?) in this page that can be useful. Not able to get a direct link to it, scroll down.https:/…fjogur-ny-smit-i-kvoldObviously the capital region has most infections (133) followed by the south (4) with some quarantines (10-35) in the Westfjords and the North.The source of infections: From abroad - 70% & local - 26%. I guess this is just the source, might be more useful to know how it is currently spreading in the country, through foreigners or locals."
"If i was elderly, and or had health issues then i most definitely would stay at home. If i became ill or had symptoms i wouldnt travel. If I'm unlucky enough to get ill then i will self isolate, at my own expense if necessary. I dont expect to be a burden on anyones health service. The virus is everywhere and i think it's beyond containment. I do agree with sensible measures to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. I am making the personal choice not to completely put my life on hold and to listen to the experts. My opinion and i am entitled to it"
David Absolutley spot on.. I 100% agree
"I am baffeled that people are still having these kind of discussions, do you not see what most likely will happen next? How could anyone even consider traveling as a tourist, considering what is happening in other countries around Iceland right now. Iceland is not different from these countries. What we are seeing in other countries will also happen in Iceland, maybe even worse, since they are high on infection rates and the goverment seems to be slow in reacting.So I don't have to copy mye entire post from another thread, the rest of my text is here:https:/…106034228"
"I am booked to visit in mid-May but it is looking like we are going to have to cancel, or, most likely, be prevented from going by travel restrictions. If I were booked to go this week on the 17th for just 4 days I would still go PROVIDED there was virtually nil chance I already had the virus and was able to self-isolate for 14 days after returning. I would not go on tours with large numbers of others and would practice good hand hygiene. From what I have read most of the infected people are locals who caught the virus in Italy and Austria and would be in self-isolation. On a four day trip, providing you were not ill or infected yourself it is highly unlikely you will be a burden on Icelands health system, barring an accident."
On the other hand a lot can change in 4 days; just think of what has changed worldwide in the last 4 days!EVERYONE should be avoiding nonessential travel right now.
Cybertrav I agreeAt the end of the day as ive said unless there are measures from preventing people going then the choice to go can only be made by you. Unless I am told I cant I will be on that plane on the 18th. Thats my decision and regardless of what anyone thinks of it thats the decision I have made.
"@scottyf1412, my point was exactly what you started your post with: It is highly likely that someone WILL tell you that you can not go, or that you will be stuck in Iceland in a lockdown situation. Based on what is happening in other countries right now, it is in my opinion highly likely that within days (diffcult to say exactly how long) Iceland will follow in the path of these other countries, and there will be drastic measures in place that will completely shut down all tourism and travel. If you insist on your current stance, you can only hope that it happens before you go, and not while you are there.Like I already mentioned, the biggest risk for a tourist now is not the virus itself, or getting infected, but it is what happens if a lockdown is implemented. The situation for a tourist could be come uncomfotable to say the least, and getting home could be difficult in a worst case scenario. And if you are stuck in Iceland you will only be an unnecessary burden on the Icelandic infrastructure even if you are not infected.Insisting on going through with short term vacation plans at this point is in my opinion irresponsible."
"#44, +1. I couldn’t have put it better. Too many have no personal responsibility.“ I would still go PROVIDED there was virtually nil chance I already had the virus” How do you know there is nil chance you don’t have the Virus? All of us potentially could have the virus, it’s only once we get the symptoms we know we have it. There appears to be a fairly long incubation period when you are symptom free but a carrier."
"Please people, don´t travel! Not only talking about Iceland but all the other countries of the world, what we need now is to contain this virus and that people unite by not travelling so they don´t spread it to more countries!"
"#43The wife of Canada’s Prime Minister, Sophie Gregoire, is currently in isolation at home after testing positive for COVID-19 shortly after returning from a speaking engagement in London, England. Our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau is now in quarantine for 2 weeks!Do you think Mrs Trudeau would put her children, elderly parents, and her husband at risk if she had known that she was already infected when she got on the plane to come back home to Canada?Edited: 10:08 am, March 15, 2020 "
You can also check out the Reddit subreddit on Iceland Travel to get an additional perspective. There's a mega thread on Covid-19 right now.
"Just had a quick look at Reddit’s Iceland mega thread:The impression (additional perspective) I got is that there are a lot of people there worried about: me, me, me and me.Yes, Iceland is beautiful and I don’t doubt that tourists there right now are having a wonderful time and everything seems pretty normal. Having said that, I’m sure the same could be said about Italy 2-3 weeks ago! The travellers to Italy at that time were involved in spreading the disease to the Italian population and infecting family members, friends and strangers in their countries when they returned home. That’s my perspective!Being asked to cancel your trip, and taking the financial hit if you can’t get reimbursed, isn’t about ”you” but rather about “them” ie all the other people that you will be putting at risk when you arrive in Iceland, and then when you get back home IF you’ll be allowed to do so according to one’s current plans.Please think carefully and choose responsibly for everyone’s sake, including your own and those you care about."
Did you post to Reddit to state your perspective?
I didn’t because I don’t use Reddit; I signed up for it in the past to follow a particular thread related to the company my son works for. I’m actually going to speak to him now to see if he can post for me. Thank you!
"I came across a few posts saying masks don't work but they do.Masks alone will not protect you from contracting the virus, but can reduce the chances of being infected if worn correctly in combination with sanitizing the hands etc. There's no real practical way to protect the eyes though.This is more important: once infected, or even if you have a normal cough or don't know if you are infected during the travel, masks will considerably reduce the spreading of virus when you cough. If you can get your hands on an N95 well and good (but needs to be worn properly) or surgical masks perform just as well.The best way to avoid the virus is by avoiding groups but wearing masks when in a crowded area is the second best. Particularly when traveling, just wear a mask. You may or may not have the virus but you'll never know till the symptoms show, and in the meantime you'll also protect others around you.I don't work in healthcare or anything, this is just my understanding. If I'm wrong, others can correct."
"I think it may be a good idea to read up on WHO guidelines on masks - https:/…when-and-how-to-use-masksGenerally - healthy people need to wear masks only when taking care of those who are sick or suspected of infection. The problem also is most people don't know how to wear masks properly, and they also tend to touch their face more often which increase the chances of getting infected.Edited: 11:47 am, March 15, 2020 "
"@PLtraveler: I just made my first reddit post! Note that my user name is different.Edit: I agree with your response on masks :)Edited: 12:03 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Anyone planning to travel in today's scenario needs to learn to wear masks as well.True. When home, masks are needed only when a family member is infected. But when traveling you never know who is infected, including yourself."
"roofrider - that's not the advice given by WHO or any of the health agencies, even when traveling. As a matter of fact, there is general discouragement because this is causing a run on masks and as a result, those who really need it are unable to get them. If you insist, there's no one stopping you, but you may be contributing to the problem.deltawing - good for you.Edited: 12:44 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Leave N95s for those who really need it. Surgical masks suffice for the general public.
"https:/… Another article, this time from Time, giving a US viewpoint about masks - in this case the US Surgeon General and CDC. Pretty much all the health agencies have the same advice. I am not sure how many different ways to tell you it is not necessary and actually discouraged. Leave the surgical masks also to those who need them."
"I work for a health organization. If healthy people take N95 masks, my people, who are working with sick people, can't get them.I am fighting to get them any masks I can, even the non N-95s as they are better than nothing, but only barely. Healthy people taking N95s are killing other people."
@ Dave2112Have you decided what you are doing yet then?
"@Dave2112 Me and my husband are in the same situation like yours. We are newly weds and have planned our honeymoon trip to Iceland from 10th April to 17th April. It costed us an arm to book our trip from India including land package. Both cancel/reschedule options leaves us with peanuts as we checked with the operators and we can’t afford to again spend on the same trip again this year. I am closely monitoring the situation anyways in an optimistic approach :) , in case you get there , do let us know if things get rough or anything.Edited: 11:08 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Here now - increased emphasise on hand cleansing, contactless payment rather than cash encouraged. We have hired a people carrier so hopefully reducing the risk as not on coaches/buses. Many of the visitor attractions are vast open spaces so again managing to maintain some distance. It's alot quieter here than normal but that can only be a good thing to reduce contamination. Museums etc are expected to remain open but not ventured out today yet to see how the ban on gatherings of more than 100 has impacted. Only you can make the decision whether to travel taking into account all the available OFFICIAL advice not keyboard scaremongering."
"@scottyf1412 Got to say not as confident as I was last week. Reading that 1% of the Icelandic population may be covid-19 positive doesn't help. My biggest fear though is someone on the plane taking a coughing fit going through the airport, and us all getting quarantined. That happened to a mate of mine in a different country just last week. He's been in lockdown for a week now. The whole world is going mad. Our supermarket shelves are empty - obviously the antidote to the virus is a mixture of bananas and dried pasta !!!!! I am not in anyway worried about the virus. I am very worried about how mankind is dealing with, and reacting to it. Gonna make a final decision in the morning. Wife wants to stay in UK, she normally gets her own wayEdited: 6:34 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Depends on how one looks at that 1%. The local authorities seem to think it's less.https:/…Considering Iceland has done more tests per capita than any other country it makes sense for the rate of infection to seem high. IMO, the problem is not Iceland. I feel it is safe. But like you said it's the airports, flights, transit points for those coming from far, and the border restrictions in place in several countries.In other news, Greenland has had its first case :("
"I have previously in some threads pointed out that statistically Iceland had very high numbers of infected, actually highest of any country. However, I think now that the reason for this is that in most other countries the numbers are heavily under-reported. Many (most?) countries have more or less given up testing everyone with symptoms, or they lack a system to efficiently test and register the cases. Here in Norway for example we have recieved notice that if you are having symptoms you are to consider yourself infected and stay in isolation. Only people working in healthcare and other ciritcal functions or people in the risk groups are actually going to be tested, they do not have the capacity for anything more than that.Iceland on the other hand seem to have a very high testing capacity, through the company deCODE Genetics, which seem to be doing the actual tests. So I find it likely that the results in Iceland are much more realistic that in most other countries, but this also makes Iceland look bad in official statistics.All that said, my previous warnings against traveling as a tourst still stands, and recent developent shows that more and more is beeing closed and locked down, even in Iceland. And it is highly likely that there are more restrictions to come. At the moment, the travel restrictions imposed all around Europe makes any kind of discussion about tourist travel more or less pointless.These are serious times. We are still at an early stage, and the coming weeks is likely to be crucial in how the situation develops. Exactly how serious this is is anyones guess at the moment, but it seems likely that we all will be affected in many ways for a long time into the future. I have seen some interviews in the Icelandic media with the CEO of the above mentioned deCODE company, Kári Stefánsson, and if I understand Icelandic correctly, in one of the interviews he said ""if you were to write a sience fiction story about the end of mankind, this would be a good first chapter"". It is to be noted that he was somewhat joking and does not predict the end of mankind, I suppose he just wanted to stress how serious the situation is.Personally we have three shorter trips planned and booked for this year, one of them (as usual) to Iceland. Currently we consider them all as lost. And it is the least of our concerns at the moments. If my mom and dad gets infected it is highly likely that we will loose them both, and even we ourselves are approaching an age where we are statistically close to being in the risk groups. Also, even if our jobs are not directly affected by the current shutdowns, the long term economic consequences are likely to be dire for many types of industries and businesses. At the moment we just make the best we can out of the situation and wait it out. Stay safe everyone and try to be a better version of yourself. It is often said that a crisis brings out the best in people, but what I have seen in the last days I find it just as likely that it brings out the worst in many people. Don't be one of those."
"Totally agree with Jxxixx.I want to add:Although we do the occasional health-issue question here on the TA threads then I venture that most of us travelers are generally in good health. For those of us under 60 that can do a brisk 10-minute walk while holding a conversation chances are the impact of this outbreak on our health will be minimal. For us this outbreak is a big inconvenience, possible loss of money already paid, possible loss of income. All things we have the rest of our lives to recover from.It’s the group that is at risk that I worry about and is the group we should focus on. The travel-bans, group-bans, isolation… they are all aimed at containing the distribution to protect those with weaker lungs, weaker immune systems and generally weaker health. This includes a higher proportion of the elderly, but also diabetics, organ-transplants, cancer-patients and so on.I do not want to be the one that carries the virus to someone in that high-risk group, nor to anyone else that might then carry it to that high-risk group. If my precautions – including “sacrificing” a non-refundable trip – help in containing the outbreak then fine. I will do my part.Edited: 6:10 am, March 17, 2020 "
"well said Jxxx and Gesture: ..Most of the cases found in India are carried by a person who had recent travel history .and have passed on to immediate family member as second victim..casualty as of now are old family members..One in known surrounding is far more safer then travelling among unknown in flight/bus and tours...neither I want to carry virus back home nor I want anyone to get infected while I travel.. Hence please stay Put in your own home rather then getting stuck in another country ..I have atleast 2 family member kids who are stuck in Canda/US as they are been asked to leave Hostel..and now they are returning in 2/3 daysStay safe, Stay HOme.."
"Thank you @jxxxixxx for your post; you have helped get the message through at a time of great uncertainty and contradicting opinions.I agree with you that many countries are under testing and consequently their case numbers are underrepresented on websites like https:/…countries giving the reader a false impression of the real situation in many (if not the majority) of countries. The reasons for this may vary from country to country, but travellers need to keep this in mind and refrain from travelling for the next few months, at the very least.These are unprecedented times in modern history, but this too shall pass. Wishing everyone strength and courage!"
