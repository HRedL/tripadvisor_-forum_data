"What the Amazon fires mean for wild animals: For the thousands of mammal, reptile, amphibian, and bird species that live in the Amazon, the wildfires’ impact will come in two phases: one immediate, one long-term.https://bit.ly/30DBBEE“In the Amazon, nothing is adapted to fire,” says William Magnusson, a researcher specialising in biodiversity monitoring at the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA) in Manaus, Brazil.In some forests, including many across the U.S., wildfires are essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems. Animals are adapted to cope with it; many even rely on it to thrive. The black-bellied woodpecker, for example, native to the American West, only nests in burnt-out trees and eats the beetles that infest burned wood.But the Amazon is different.The rainforest is so uniquely rich and diverse precisely because it doesn’t really burn, says Magnusson. While fires do sometimes happen naturally, they’re typically small in scale and burn low to the ground. And they’re quickly put out by rain.“Basically, the Amazon hadn’t burnt in hundreds of thousands or millions of years,” says Magnusson. It’s not like in Australia, for instance, where eucalyptus would die out without regular fires, he says. The rainforest is not built for fire."
"The federal government of Brazil has decided to ban the setting of fires throughout the country during the dry season.A Decree incorporating the ban was issued on Wednesday and should be published on today in the Federal Gazette.The decree suspends permits for the use of fire for a period of sixty days, intending to protect the environment.The Forestry Code only permits fires in specific cases and when authorized by an environmental entity. In the case of indigenous peoples, the practice is allowed in subsistence farming.The measure was announced in the midst of the environmental crisis involving forest fires in the Amazon."
"According the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), the Brazilian agency that monitors fires, the fires this past August in the Amazon were almost three times the number recorded last year.There were 30,901 fires until this Saturday, August 31st, compared to 10,421 in August of last year, an increase of 196 percent.The total number of outbreaks also exceeds the historical monthly average for August -- 25,853 -- measured between 1998 and 2018.
