"Hi there,My name is Gustavo and I'm from Brazil. First of all, sorry for any english error.Well...My friends and I going to travel to San Francisco next June.Due to coronavirus emergency, I have to say that we are a little worried. So, we'd like an opinion from you. Do you think we should reschedule the trip? Or, if you were in this situation, what would you do?"
"I'd reschedule. We are under a Shelter-In-Place order until at least early May, but that will probably be extended until late May - we just don't know, it could be longer. And when the Shelter-In-Place order is lifted, it will probably be in phases - certain types of businesses first, then others as time goes on. That means that even if the Shelter-In-Place order is lifted before your arrival, the things you want to see and do may or may not be open. Its just not a good time to be traveling."
"Your English is fine but I think we should nail down your definition of ""next June."" Do you mean THIS June, as in 2020? Or NEXT June which would mean 2021? (It's confusing and often misinterpreted by native English speakers.) THIS June is off limits I would say. There's no assurance that international travel bans won't still be in place. In fact, I'd bet that flights from South America won't be landing here in June, 2020. And it's not clear what parts of the economy will be the priority to re-open. It may not be the tourist industry. Which would mean that lodgings, National and State Parks wouldn't be open. Could also mean that restaurants and bars remain closed. In fact, it isn't yet clear that anything will reopen in June. NEXT June (2021) is another story. So let us know which you were intending."
"Agree, if its this June which it seems it may be given the fact that you say you are a little worried , Id postpone the trip or at least be prepared to do so as the date nears. If its next June (2021) I wouldnt be thinking too much about it 14 months a head of time and definitely wouldnt be worried about it right now."
"Sorry Madeline, really I didn’t express myself well. I wanted to say this June (June, 2020)."
I would definitely re-schedule.
"You don't want to be here in June 2020 even if it is allowed (and we don't know yet). Currently the shelter-in-place or stay-at-home order is in effect until May 3, and I heard it has been extended to mid May (???). It takes a while for things to be back to sort-of normal. Some small businesses may not come back. We are always at risk of having a relapse of Covid-19 cases. If it happens, you may be stuck being in the USA or San Francisco, or have to be quarantined going back home. Lots of potential hassle that you don't want to deal with. While you are here in June, you most likely won't have a full travel experience compared to normal. Ask yourself: what's the rush? Should you want to spend your hard-earned travel money this way?"
"So would I. Even if things open up by then, it will take some time for everything to be back to normal. If you can make it June 2021, I think it would be more safe."
"""Same time next year"" is a good motto right now. And I'm still doubtful that international flights from Brazil/South American will be operating in June."
I don't think it's a good time to travel in US.You should be well prepared if you want to travel in Jun.I will try to find a few links about you should know about travel in US and post them.https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information…https:/…covid-19-information.htmlhttps:/…travel-in-the-us.htmlMaby rent a rv is a not bad idea for you.Unavoidable access to people by public transport.https://www.storyrv.com/ is a site about rv.Please be sure to wear a mask..Good Luck
">>We are always at risk of having a relapse of Covid-19 cases. If it happens, you may be stuck being in the USA or San Francisco, or have to be quarantined going back home.<<Won't that be the case until there is a vaccine? So even 2021 wouldn't be recommended, since a vaccine is estimated at 12-18 months away."
"June 2021 is a long way from now. Okay to plan, but even if the physical landscape will not change, the commercial/tourism will have changed for better or worse.So flexibility is the tried and true approach. Cancellable, refundable reservations as you start to make them.Also look at alternatives closer to home."
"As it stands now, YES I would cancel. I had to make a quick trip to SF over the weekend, and judging from the boarded up restaurants and shops and general depressing feel, I can't imagine enjoying a vacation there any time soon. Just because some businesses are allowed to open up again doesn't mean they will, and it certainly doesn't mean people will actually be out and about like they used to be. I'd wait until sometime next year based on how things covid-19 related are going at that point.Edited: 1:51 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Hard to say at this point regarding a June 2021 trip to SF. I hope/suspect #12 post thought the OP said June 2020 versus June 2021. You can easily hold tight until November, December or January to make reservations & buy plane tickets. Plenty of time to make plans. Fear not, patience & temperance should be exercised at this juncture.Edited: 6:45 pm, May 21, 2020 "
Gustavo I live in Brazil too and would advise you to postpone the trip and not just because of the coronavirus crisis but also because of the horrible exchange rate at the moment. It is almost RS6 to the dollar and San Francisco is pretty expensive.
