"Has anyone been to B Aires in the past month. I am trying to get a feel for the swine flu situation down there. I want to book a trip in late aug-early sept but am afraid that they will close the night clubs, restaurants, bars, etc to try to contain it. I read they have considered it.If anyone has been down there recently or is planning on going in the next couple weeks, please let me know your thoughts on the situation.Thanks"
"Here is a discussion that has been ongoing since the Swine Flu made the news here in BA.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g312741-i979-k2905â€¦It is cold here, today was Independence Day and while the traffic was light because it was a holiday, everyone was out enjoying the cold sunny day. Museums, movie theatres and tourist attractions in Recoleta were all open and busy.Read the other thread .... "
You can read the BA Herald online for an up to date account of the epidemic.http://www.buenosairesherald.com/
"I just returned last week from BA. Some locals are panicking due to the coverage on local Argentine tv. On the streets, for the most part, everything looks fine. Beware though, when I left, there was talk of closing public places of gathering such as theaters, etc. I doubt it will come to that but if you have any event planned that might possibly cancelled, you might want to make alternative plans. Just keep good hand hygene and try not to to bring fingers to your mouth, nose and eyes. "
Here's another more recent and candid account of what's happening right now in Buenos Aires with regards to swine flu. http://landingpadba.com/?s=swine+flu&x=0&y=0
"Thanks for that, Maya..I have a friend who lives in Texas. They were the first area to get the flu after Mexico.She said the first thing the officials did was close the schools. ( children are little germ factories who go home and infect the parents who go to work and spread the germs :)She said the quick work by the health officials spared them a much bigger problem.So giving the children here a longer holiday than they would be taking now anyway, seems to be a great idea.I was told by a friend ( doctor) that the people who should be wearing masks would be the people who are sick, not the well people.. since this is spread by saliva ( spit,sneeze,cough) .. I hear the regular flu is winding down, I am hoping this one will be goo."
I am hoping this one will be too.( goo?? lol)

"Masks shouldnt be used unless you are already sick. 1. The germs can get by the cloth... so it is useless, it really helps to avoid you coughing on people. 2. If you are healthy and wear it, you are creating a perfect environment for the germs (moist and warm) right on your mouth. They will thrive there and put you at higher risk. "
