"Just wondering is there is a 'smoking room' at the airport, after security. Thank you."
"Not anymore as far as I know, unless maybe at one of the many bars."
I have never seen one.
No smoking in public places in cancun unless its open air which is a great thing.
"Thanks for your reply, but I didn't ask for your OPINION."
Just flew back from Cancun last week. No smoking inside the airport but right outside the doors you can.
Well no need to be snide!!! Sorry if you dont like it but as a person who father just died on sunday to lung cancer from smoking I have a strong opinion of people killing my kids!!! And I can give my opinion if I chooseEdited: 10 years ago 
Very sorry to hear of your loss. I apologize. I know that smoking vs. non smoking is a very contentious issue.
smoking along with toplessness they fit into the same category as politics and religion. Everybody has their OWN opinion and will jump down anyones throat over it........freedom of speech people.....I also like the fact of the non-smoking......I smoked for many years and cannot stand it now.
Does anyone know if there are non smoking resorts?
"All of the resorts will be no smoking inside buildings like many restaurants, lobby lounges, etc. That's Mexican law. If the restaurant is stand alone and tons of open sides then it might be allowed. They may have some smoking allowed rooms or where we go it's smoke on the balcony if you wish to smoke in your room."
"If you don't like it go to Honolulu. You can't even smoke on the balcony there! It is fine though to stuff your face with fried foods, drink anything with high fats or alcohol or be 100 lbs. overweight."
"I am also one of those anti smokers. If you have to come on a forum and ask if there is smoking in an airport, then you have a serious habit that we will be glad to break. How you ask us, take up drinking instead. Try a frosty mug of your favorite Mexican beer, or a nice golden Margarita as soon as you get off the plane. Oh, and if you chose not to save your lungs and your familys too, do me a favor and let me die of someting other than second hand smoke...Art"
"LUPY1948,Cancun did have a smoking area around Margaritaville a couple of years ago, but that's gone away. You have to smoke outside before you go through security. (those nicotene patches really help to keep me from killing someone when I can't smoke) :-)"
"wow! Different from DR. I went with 32 people last April and I would say 25-28 of them smoked. Every single one lit up the second they got off the airport in the lobby waiting for the baggage. Smoking was allowed in your room at the resort, disco, lobbies, etc. Not in closed room (like buffet) but everywhere else."
"thanks for the info scorpion, now i am 100% sure i will never visit the dr, not trying to be funny at all, i really do appreciate it. my husband & i have talked about possibly going (for several years) so now it's a done deal, no way, unless the smoking laws change there! i don't judge anyone that chooses to smoke, i just don't want to be anywhere near it!Edited: 10 years ago "
"for the most part the airport is open air but it does have a roof (straw type) and smoking was allowed everywhere. The lobby at the resort we were at had no doors... but a roof. Smoking was allowed everywhere. Of course it was also allowed in cigar shops, some souvenier stores, casino, discos, open air theatre, rooms, etc. The only place I didn't see smoking was in the ala carte restaurants, coffee shop and buffet. There was smoking in the sports bar though. That was a year ago. Not sure if it has changed but I was mostly surprised at the airport part."
I smoke but don't drink---perhaps my liver means more to me than my lungs........
"As a former smoker, I know smoking is bad for you, but so is eating all that processed and greasy food many people eat. The obesity epidemic makes sometimes wonder what is worst smoking or eating."
"You could smoke outside the airport before checking in but to be honest, we arrived at the airport at 5 am for a 7 am flight... by the time we got through check-in, security, etc.... we would have had no time for a quick smoke anyway..."
