"Hello Travel Experts. Greetings. With the advent of current happenings and WHO reports on the confirmed cases, I would like to seek your advise and recommendation, I have planed travel from 24/01/2020 to 27/01/2020 for Phuket with plans to visit the nearby island and other water activities. I am now trying to get all the inputspoints to decide to continue the trip or cancel . My flights are non refundable, hotel is partially refundable :D Thanks for your response,Regards,RJ"
And of the approx 70m people in Thailand a handful have picked up this virus.I think you stand a better chance of winning the State lottery.
"Never seen any Chinese inside Indian restaurants in Phuket, you should be safe to come."
"""Current happenings of what? The Wuhan coronavirus? Chinese travelers will be coming to Mumbai as well during CNY, so staying there, coming here, what's the difference.""Oh Crap ... 555"
"You should definitely cancel. If you need to ask then you really shouldn't risk traveling outside of your own home town, let alone anywhere else in India."
oh and you missed the one about the asteroid.
"""oh and you missed the one about the asteroid."" - I missed that one as well 555!But I do remember a very similar question a while ago about travelling with the impending solar eclipse, and it was from the same part of the world IIRC.Yes, same advice - stay at home!"
"Far too dangerous for you to go outside your front door while this epidemic is under way., RJ. All those Chinese people will be swarming about all over the place and probably many of them have been sneezing and coughing."
"Stay at home if you're being serious and concerned about itPlenty of people in Thailand coughing all the time, and I've yet to see anyone in the 12 days I've been here, even attempt to cover their mouth when coughing"
you're more at risk in india of catching something -what with people sh-tting on the streets and overpopulation
You should be fine. Being Indian the Chinese and Thais who don’t work in tourist sector will give you a wide berth anyway.
"We are in Phuket now and it’s great, don’t believe everything you see in the news. They only show the worst stuff and very dramatic.JT from Dallas, Tx"
Thanks for the update.
there won't be ANY Chinese there this year as china has been shut down -
"There is no reason to cancel.Some of the responses here are unnecessarily rude, others simply incorrect.China has not been shut down."
"Only the 11 million in Wuhan have been 'quaranteened.....555Along with other areas now having transit banned, along with many NY celebrations cancelled. Affected almost as many people that live in Thailand. Or more, if including the celebrations.Correct, some posts are just incorrect.Edited: 8:34 pm, January 23, 2020 "
"#15 ""China has not been shut down.""What about the Uyghurs, are they free to travel?"
"Only after they reach 'enlightenment' .... 555""According to Chinese government operating procedures, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the main feature of the camps is to ensure adherence to Chinese Communist Party ideology. Inmates are continuously held captive in the camps for a minimum of 12 months depending on their performance in Chinese ideology tests"""
Was it ever determined what happened to these Uyghers https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general…So much for China not being shut down.Oh and I forgot the Tibetans.

"Did who visit Phuket, Rahul?"
"I just cancel my Trip. BKK and HKT are in High level ,High risk .UK Gov not recommend to travel to Thailand as CoronaVirus. Thai Gov is moving military to Main cities Bangkok, Phuket... Flight to Thailand is safe for now ...but only one way!!! I love Thailand .Sorry not this time."

Don’t worry Rahul. I am consufed all the time. It doesn’t hurt or have any long lasting effects.
go to nepal instead
"WHO declared it a 'WorldWide Epidemic"".....555They live in a small world. Virus in only 18 of the 195 countries. Not even 10 %https:/…Screenshot-55.pngEdited: 12:29 am, January 31, 2020 "
It's in Nepal..........oh my Buddha
"The chances of getting killed in a road accident in Thailand is a multiple in comparison to contract the corona virus. The daily carnage is 60+ people, whereas 14 people within 6 weeks were suspected of have the corona virus and 8 people were already discharged again from the hospital. What]s the fuzz some people are doing here.In the Thailand forum is little to no concern by people renting and riding a motorbike, whereas the safety risk is high."
Road accident is killing more people than virus but in bangkok more people are wearing mask rather than helmet
"Therefore Rahul, what are you on about?"
i dropped my trip to thailand
"OK, so you're not here, or coming, but know, mask vs helmets numbers.Here's a vid, posted today sometime by a vlogger, and I was actually surprised the lack of masks seen. Made a couple days ago.for crowds without masks; skip up to 4:27"
"rahul546, that’s great news."
"I cancelled my bangkok, phuket trip . if you can manage to enjoy in the atmosphere of fear than you can go to the trip because chances of being infected is very less but fear of being infected is too much. it is upto you.but still risk is there."
"Hi JagdishNow that really is a foolish and irresponsible question. How would any other contributors to the forum, who are travellers just like you, have any more information than you are able to source.Now you may not be used to being responsible and making your own decisions, but this is one time when you will have to do just that."
"There is absolutely NO atmosphere of fear in Phuket. It is business as usual, although a lot quieter than usual. And very few Chinese tourists from what I have seen.Come or don't come, up to you. But this forum is not a good place to get advice.Mark."
"No one can tell you what to do, it is totally your choice as to whether you continue on with your trip or cancel."
anyone over there at the mo?Noticed anything different? Quieter? Less locals around etc?Bangla rd not as packed etc etc etc?
#47....less locals?Certainly less Chinese.
"I have a two week Phuket and BKK trip booked starting March 1st. As things stand today, I am going ahead with the trip. But keeping a watch on daily developments and will reassess should the situation deteriorate."
Wow... some people here do get nasty.. woah ..
"@ POST 50Quite so fellow memberThe answer is if they have had enough of these questions just ignore and move on to something elseI big ask on here I am afraid, because that will not help their POST count at all 555I am staying in Malaysia with the hatches battened down myself until this blows itself out if anybody is remotely interestedTo those who are more adventurous I wish you Happy Travels and a SAFE return home"
