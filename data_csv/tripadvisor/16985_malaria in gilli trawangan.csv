"ive just read a post about malaria tablets in lombok and the gili`s.i am spending 4 days in gili trawangan in september but didnt know that there was malaria on the island and am a bit worried now.dont really fancy getting malaria tablets for the reasons of taking them weeks before i go, when im there and weeks after leaving. plus all the side affects e.g nausea, sunburn etc.whats everybody`s views on malaria tablets in lombok and the gili`s?do we really need them???cheers "
"I wouldn't worry. My son and daughter go there regularly (my son has been surfing at Lombok for 7 years) and they have never had any trouble with malaria. If you are worried, just take some safety precautions i.e. long-sleeved shirt, insect repellent and burn a mosquito coil at night. "
"Its a personal decision. Lombok is not malaria free. Its not epidemic, but there are cases of malaria on Lombok.Lots of people go there and don't take the pills. But its a personal decision.Dengue is epidemic everywhere, including Bali. "
has there been many cases of people getting malaria on gili trawanagan?my doctor has recommended taking malaria tablets but i dont really want all the side affects on holiday. i know the side affects of malaria are a lot worse but still dont want to feel ill when im away.also what is the best way of preventing getting bit?do the holtels on gili t has bed nets etc?cheers 
I live and work on gilli trawangan and have done for around a year now and have never heard of one case of malaria on the island.The island is particularly dry outside of the months of dec+jan so this inhibits the reproduction of the mosquitos. in saying this though there have been some cases of dengue fever which is also mosquito transmitted but these are mainly in the village and not in the accomodation areasIn short no need for malaria tablets just come along but remember to wear repellant around sunrise and sunset as with every tropical locationeven if its not transmitting disease mozzy bites are really irritating.cheers
"i will be in in the gili islands in sep as well as bali and lombok. we are not taking any malaria medication (ie doxycycline). my understanding this is not a problem on the gilis and only in a few more isolated areas of lombok. i travel to bali on a regular basis and this question gets asked a lot. it is of course advisable to check for the latest information b4 traveling and do what feels best for you. i even asked my doctor 2 weeks ago as a precaution and there is no 'new' evidence suggesting doxycycline is necessary unless trekking in remote areas. we always take a good insect repellant and find the mozzies are worse early morning and evening. we also spray our room while we go out for dinner. Yes there are places to stay with mosquito nets and if you choose a place with air con then you can sleep with windows closed and there is less chance of them entering the room. just pack your repellant, a can of spray for your room and also some mossie coils and enjoy."
