"If you have had the flu, which is getting much media attention in the US this winter, how have you handled doctors, meds, hospital. Do you have any tips for dealing with this experience? Thank you in advance."
"For most people, you just have to let it run its course."
Many resorts have docs on staff or can get one for you quickly for a very reasonable price. Pharmacies are available with medication to help with the symptoms. Cheryl
"I posed this question hoping someone who had gotten the flu while in Cancun would answer, but that has not been the case. Elderly people who have caught this year's especially potent virus in the US have been hospitalized and even died and since my husband and I are elderly and will be in Cancun, I wanted to hear from someone who had experienced flu while there. Also, is Tamiflu available over the counter in Cancun?"
"Have you had a flu shot? If not, I'd politely suggest that this may be your best defence against getting the flu in the first place - along with frequent hand washing and staying clear of anyone who appears to be sick or getting sick (which can be tricky on an aircraft)."
"Thank you. Have had the flu shot, which may help somewhat in lessening the virulence of the virus, but may not stop it completely. We are religious about hand wipes and washing hands. However, we live in a state with an epidemic."
"I don't know if I had the flu but I had something... The third day I was afraid I was getting dehydrated so my DH called the Doc.He came to the house, checked me out and gave me some meds that did the trick, fixed me right up!Sadly, as CherylP suggested, ""for a very reasonable price"", the price is not so reasonable anymore but well worth it!"
"I too have to take exception with the ""reasonable price"". I made the mistake of seeking medical care from the physician provided at the royal resort, and that was a huge mistake. I thought they were joking when they told me the cost of service. Live & learn - next time I'll head down to the hospital."
There has been news recently that the flu shot this winter missed the mark for some of the flu bugs going around. We got the jab (How's that UK'rs.) but I still caught a chest cold. wasn't too severe though.
