"Is it easier and cheaper to pick up a taxi from the taxi rank at the airport than prebooking? Arriving about 9pm on Friday returning around 6.30pm Sunday, staying at the Imperial by Rocquaine Bay. Backstory ....Two friends and I are due to visit Guernsey this coming weekend to celebrate our birthdays, but still in two minds whether to cancel....booked with Aurigny (thankfully not Flybe) and they will change booking or refund free of charge, so there’s no monetary loss there, but also booked the Imperial for two nights and will lose that payment, unless the insurance (through Axa) will pay. I was born in Guernsey and haven’t been back for 30 years and was so looking forward to seeing the Cup and saucer and visiting my favourite beach (Portelet) and walking up to Pleinmont ....So many happy memories! Might loiter outside our old family home on Rue de Laitte, too!"
