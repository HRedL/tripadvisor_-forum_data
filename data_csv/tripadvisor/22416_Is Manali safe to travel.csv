Is it safe to travel to Manali right now with COVID19 all over india
"Do you feel safe in your city?Do you feel safe traveling on flight or bus?Do you feel safe standing in crowded places like check in queue at airport or any other places?Till now no confirm case in HP but who knows,may be any tourist visit with infection and infect someone.I don't know what you guys are expecting from forum members but no one in this world can tell about your saftey under current circumstances,even many state government are discouraging domestic tourist by taking various steps,no one knows what can happen tomorrow.It's totally your call,what's your priority.In my opinion we should avoid unnecessary travel."
Better to avoid travel presently
Please avoid all non critical travel for next couple of weeks.
Manali is safe but better to avoid travelling because of gathering on various places due to it
Its Better to avoid travelling. COVID - 19 Cases are increasing day by day..
Under current circumstances due to COVID - 19 it is not safe to travel Manali. Wail some time and watch the situation. Once these bad things get settle down then start a tour with any tour package.
Manali is very safe to travel as such there is no corona cases detected anywhere in this region.But only issue is which city you are initiating the travel ? Also nearest airport is chandigarh/Delhi -Both are closedwhen it will be open ? After that only we can able to predict the situation
"I Suggest U to avoid travelling Manali in this current Scenario due to outbreak of corona virus. I think u can think about it after 14th April. If u live in delhi u can book your bus from redbus, makemytrip, railyatri etc.https:/…delhi-to-manali-buses"
Not Safe Now Any City for Travel
"Please plan after September, hope cases will be very less or nil at that time"
"In this pandemic COVID-19, avoid traveling and tackle CORONAVIRUS."
Namaste!Welcome to the forum post!!!I agreed with the above posts. Lockdown has extended till 17th May but cases are increasing day by day. After 17th May maybe lockdown will be extended. But Nobody can predict about what will happen after 17th May. We should avoid unnecessary travelling as said by Rahul sir. Better to stay at home and make your plan when things will right. Thanks & Regards
No. The government is planning to open travel sector after September/October. Plan accordingly.
If you would like to travel with like-minded people I would suggest you have a look at https:/…The experience of travelling solo but with safety of a group. Cheers.
