Please refrain from littering the forums with these price lists. Either write a review or compose a travel article. Thank you.
"I would like to take the opportunity to insert a point on this thread: despite an epidemic of entry fee inflation in China, particularly at natural sights, Beijing's sights major and minor have had their fees kept in check and remain extremely good value.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Kvchina: you have to take into account the quality of the sights as well.If price stays the same, but the quality goes down, the bottom line is that you get less back then what you have payed for.Major sites is not a problem I think. But many sights were renovated just before the Olympics and were never maintained after that."
"#4 I am taking into account the quality of sights. And not just the biggies that everybody knows about. BJ has a huge number of lesser-known sights, some deservedly needing a miss, but others that are hidden gems and often with entry fees of RMB 10-30....and eager to give you a ""student"" or ""old age"" discount off that depending which end of the demographic you appear to be. I understand your statement but am scratching my head and drawing a blank on particular sights you might be talking about. Care to enlighten us as to which places you feel have ""gone downhill.""Edited: 6 years ago "

"One of the major disappointments for me was Beijing Zoo a couple of years ago. Never have I seen such an bad maintained zoo in the world. Maybe it has changed by now, I don't know.Also Sidu area has some parts that were nice just after the OS, but not any more. There are more areas outside of the city sharing this fate.But you are right that there are also a lot of nice spots in the city. Personally I like the little parks.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Well I guess it's one's definition. The Beijing Zoo is not a place I think has gone downhill--mostly because it has always been a horrible place and never been ""uphill"" so had nowhere to fall from. I confess to never thinking about that place since I can't believe anybody would cross oceans and continents to see it. Sidu? You mean Shidu? That has always been just a tarted up minor gorge/lake area mostly for Beijingers to play at during the summer. Nothing too significant culturally or scenically for the foreign visitor. One ""sight"" that I think was never that interesting and now, since renovations, is not only uninteresting but also looks phony--is Prince Gong's Mansion. Entrance at RMB 40 is IMO one of the poorest values in the city, and I never recommend it to visiting foreigners. Many Chinese tour groups are bused there, though."
