"Right, I know there are numerous threads discussing the risks of catching the flu, etc. I've started this one to pick people's brains re what happens if flights are canceled.I'm due to travel to Cancun from London in 7 weeks time (June 14th); I am not particularly concerned about catching the flu if it does spread to Cancun by then, unless the death-toll soars which is doubtful, and will take simple and sensible precautions. I am however worried about what will happen if they decide to stop people flying to try and contain it.Does anyone know what the chances are of this becoming an epidemic, and, if so, if that will automatically mean that flights will be canceled?If, worst case scenario, flights ARE canceled, with Tour Operators in the UK have to rebook your holiday free of charge? Or, if I end up having to go in August, for eg, will they make me pay extra as it's more expensive to travel then?Any information or advice would be much appreciated; and please, no 'you can get flu anywhere'; the flu isn't my concern, flights being canceled is.Thanks!"
I can't ever remember airlines cancelling flights due to a flue epidemic - but if for some reason an airline cancels your flight - they must re-accommodate you on another one - so that shouldn't be an issue.
"TK1 is correct, if for some reason that happened, you would make it onto anothr flight compliments of the airline. In Mexico City, they are turning people away from their flight if they even appear to be sick, that would nvr happen here, or in the UK though."
"Thanks, that's reassuring.I feel a bit guilty worrying about something as petty as having to reschedule a holiday, what with all those poor people who have died :-s Juts want to know where I stand though.Fingers crossed all will be fine in the very near future!"
"A couple of things - I don't know why I decided to add an ""e"" to flu - makes it kinda french....and secondly - June is a long way off. We are headed down in a few weeks and I will give everyone a report when we return. Have a good trip and let us know how it went when you return!"
