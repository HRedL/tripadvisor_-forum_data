"www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jan/31/driven-cheat/The only thing I don't like about Las Vegas are the cab drivers... From ripping you off, plus the one who's got high blood pressure and got indignant because we didn't know the address of a well known restaurant. They all need to learn CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS and treat the touristsas guests. Too bad there's such a high turnover, some people should not be a cab driver."
"Although I do take cabs often, Cab drivers arent anything I give one second of thought to."
"You're right, in any other city domestic or international it doesn't affect my experience. But in Las Vegas, cab bad service sticks out like a sore thumb especially since they try to rip you off at the start of your holiday trip."
"Sweetlime, I couldnt agree with you more. My last time to Vegas(May) I got ripped off twice and treated poorly. I avoid them like the plague now unless I have no other choice. Too bad."

"Sweetlime said it all!! Think of how you feel - you've waited months for your Las Vegas vacation. You're all happy and excited. Landing in Vegas is a thrill. The sound of the slot machines at Macarren. Then you crawl into a cab and - what do you get? A confrontation with some sleezey surly cab driver or a situation where you get an in-your-face FU rip-off.Most my cab rides in Vegas have been OK experiences. Not last time. I actually had some punk cab driver get mad because he thought the distance was too short from my hotel to another location. ""You should have walked, man!"" Limos and shuttles are looking better all the time."
"Whenever I travel anywhere, be it domestically or internationally, I make myself familiar with the area I'll be visiting, be it by having a map or by printing out street by street directions to places I'll need to go. If you prepare yourself, you won't have to worry about being taken for a long ride. You have the right to dictate your route."
"I now have the Las Vegas Taxi Authority phone # programmed into my phone. I politely told the taxi driver as we headed down the freeway that I had recorded his information and would be reporting it right away. He shut off his meter part way down the freeway to reflect what the charge should have been. He didn't say anything until we arrived at the hotel when he started yelling at me for no reason, as if I had done something wrong. Guess he had never had anyone call him out on his poor customer service."
"Last time we went I asked for the most direct route from the airport and our cabbie tried to argue saying that there were road works so would be quicker to go on the freeway or I ""can sit in traffic"" to which I said yeah traffic's fine, i'm in no hurry. When she realised I wasn't new to LV and I was more bothered about being ripped off over sitting in traffic she said she'd let us off the extra charge. Went down the road she would've taken two days later. Never did see the road works!!"
"yourstarla:we usually do come prepared with addresses, but we were spoiled and this was the 1st time in 15 years that a High Blood Pressure Dude cabdriver YELLED at us for not knowing the restaurant address. He didn't say let me find out, call someone, etc just went ballistic. It's like not knowing where the Wynn hotel is. cdn_luvs_to_t::Great ideaGeocip_:Lucky you!"
"Did anyone find the article? I tried, still unable.We have never had a bad experience with Las Vegas cab drivers period. We have never told the driver ""no tunnel"" and have yet to see the tunnel. We have been visiting Vegas since the early nineties. In general, (meaning- not targeting anyone or their comments on the TA forum) do you think there is another side to this bad apple cab driver theory? Perhaps the driver might be dealing with a hostile customer who gets in their cab, barking out orders assuming they are going to be ripped off from the get-go therefore, the cab driver's defenses are at max and that is where things get ugly. Just another perspective."
lasvegassun.com/news/…I think this is the article the OP was referring to
"We've had the good, bad, and ugly. Haven't had any major issues to speak of really. It is a little sad that we have to tell the cabbies who live there to take the shortest route using the back road or no tunnel ... but I guess that is all part of the Vegas experience?"
"Rufus45:Thanks for keeping an open mind, but let me assure you that DH and I were just looking forward to an excellent dinner and did not BARK orders to anyone (we are CIVILIZED people) and had no thought about anyone ripping us off. The Airport-hotel rip off happened to me on a different day and I had already turned the page. Like I said, this has never happened to us before with the restaurant issue. Cab drivers are providing a service, most people do not go out of their way to bark orders, or anticipate getting ripped off. If you work with the public, do not take out out on the customer when you had a crappy day.pleasemum:thank you for resetting the article."
"How much more would you be willing to pay for their customer service skills raining?$1 per trip, $10 per trip?"
what was the restaurant?
"johnnylawless:you must be a foodie, it's Lotus of Siam. They have a branch out in NYC but while in Las Vegas we visit them. Mist cabdrivers know or heard of the place and if they didn't they would have just inquired unlike our ""PRESSURE"" driver. anyway, except for cab issue we had a great time, both TI and the Hotel were great."
"CousinEddie:Good question, are you starting a cabdriver customer service training center?"
"Not a foodie - but I have been to Lotus of Siam as well as probably a hundred other Thai restaurants including a few on the Mekong river. Somehow I wasn't as impressed as the NYtimes always seems to be with Lotus of Siam - not saying it is bad - just don't get the hype - like I said, I'm not a foodie. I also wouldn't really expect a cabbie to know where it is. And doubt I'd ever get in a cab without having a clue as to what to tell the driver. Expecting a cab driver to be my concierge sounds like something a foodie would do though. However, I completely agree something needs to be done about the ripoffs coming from the airport. If everyone who complained on here took the time to write a letter to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority they MIGHT do something. It really wouldn't be hard - an undercover officer riding a cab once a week from the airport would probably make it a lot better within 3 months. But even simpler woud be flat rate fares from the airport."
"""do you think there is another side to this bad apple cab driver theory? Perhaps the driver might be dealing with a hostile customer who gets in their cab, barking out orders assuming they are going to be ripped off from the get-go therefore, the cab driver's defenses are at max ""Funny no one would think of asking this question about limo drivers"
"Not to defend the cabbies but..........how much difference is there between the long way and the short way, five dollars, ten ? They must get really frustrated just going back and forth from the airport to the strip. Probably can do it with their eyes closed."
"""how much difference is there between the long way and the short way""last calculation I saw the difference is 10 million a year.lvrj.com/business/going-the-long-way-costly-…Edited: 8 years ago "
I guess it does make a difference after all !!
"I see a lot of talk about tunneling and I have never given it much thought. I always leave LAS and ask the cabbie to stop at CVS on the way to the Flamingo, so tunneling isn't an issue. But on my last trip we left the Golden Nugget to LAS and the cabbie asked me something like, ""do you want me to take the quickest route"" or ""do you want me to take the freeway?"" I said yes and I think I gave him $50, so the fare must have been $40-$42. I was surprised it was so expensive, but didn't think I got ripped off. Ending the next trip downtown, so I will be taking that fare again."
"Best taxi driver I ever had was in Philly. We just needed a short ride to the hotel. (freezing rain) This guy never talked to us. He stayed on his phone from pick-up to drop off then pointed at the meter. No long haul, no arguments, no problem. The fare was very low so I tipped him 100%."
This is why I reserve Presidential Limo!
"This official chart shows the fare for Golden Nugget FROM the airport should be about $25 - to the airport should be a bit cheaper.http://taxi.state.nv.us/FaresFees.htmWhat the driver probably asked was ""do you want the shortest way or the fastest way."" knowing most will say fastest - that is their justification for going the long way. Watch the video I posted in #24 and you will see the airport to Bellagio is maybe 2 minutes faster on the freeway."
What's the point bacchus? Many of the Vegas cabbies don't talk to you either. Doesn't keep them from trying to fleece the tourist in the back seat.
The point is alan he didn't rip us off or bytch about the short drive of about a mile.
"We used to cab it the first couple times we went to Vegas, but now we rent cars when we fly there."
Now if I can only find such a fine gentleman in Las Vegas! :)
