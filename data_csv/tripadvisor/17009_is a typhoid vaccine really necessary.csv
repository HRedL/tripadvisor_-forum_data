"My teenage daughter will be spending a month living with a family in Granada and studying Spanish. Typhoid vaccine is recommended.We've been to Nicaragua before and did not have the vaccine, but stayed in hotels then. Any feedback about this? Thanks very much."
"Typhoid vaccination IS recomended, so why not get it?You can take tablets orally."
Why not? It's pills. Find out from the dotor about contraindications. Is she pregnant or nursing? Where you stay is somewhat irrelavent. I glanced at CDC site but couldn't find anything. Suggest you take some time and look through it.
"No ... she absolutely does NOT need a Typhoid vaccine! (I'm shocked by the recommendation too btw)Right now it's winter/rainy season and there are a lot of mosquitoes. The worst thing is malaria and it's better to treat it if/when you get it than take preventative meds.I've been living here now on and off for almost 15 years and never once gotten malaria, dengue or anything else. My 13 yo daughter is here with me and never had issues either and we actually do not vaccinate our children at all.Make sure to have her use a mosquito net at night while sleeping. Consider sending some good bug spray if it's a concern of yours or she's going to be in a more country atmosphere or near the lake. Also, send sunscreen as it tends to run about $10/bottle over here!!Feel free to email!"
"If the doctor recommends it, then get it.I went to a travel clinic and got a slew of shots., typhoid being one of them."
"While the odds are slim, they are still there. If there is an easy prevention, why not take it? Definitely use repellent to avoid mozzie bites (Dengue is also a threat, although again, a slim one)."
"As the above posters says if your doctor tells you to get it, get it.Also the WHO, and the US State Department 'strongly recommend typhoid vaccination' or you can take the advice of the 'armchair doctors' on this forum and potentially put your life at risk!I wish TripAdvisor would delete medical questions from this forum."
"Hi there,I am planning to come to Grenada for a long-term stay (1 year) but I am very scared of the Dengue Fever and the mosquitos that apparently can transmit them.Recently, it looks like there's been an epidemic going on in Grenada with Dengue Fever. Is this true? How long do you stay in Grenada for? Are they short-term visits or long-term? Also, does it matter where you live?"
"BelieverAre you going to ""Grenada"" or Granada?"
I googled Grenada for Dengue fever and it is those islands that is having the epidemic--not Granada
No Dengue fever here in GRANADA
