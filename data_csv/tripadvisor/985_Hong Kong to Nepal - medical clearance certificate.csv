I'm travelling from Australia to Nepal in early April with a few hours transit in Hong Kong.I am aware of the new Nepali requirement for a medical clearance certificate for people arriving from Hong Kong but can't find any information about what is required for the certificate.Does anyone know what is required? Is there an official form? Is it just a self-completed form? Or do I need a document from a medical doctor saying that I do not have COVID?any information would be appreciated.thanks
HiI would just go to my GP and get him to write a note that says that based on his observations I do not have a respiratory illness and do not show signs of COVID19.EricMy Nepal Pages https://wanderingeric.org/category/nepal/
They have changed the policy. Now you must have a medical certificate indicating that you are not infected with Covid-19 within 7 days of your arrival.
