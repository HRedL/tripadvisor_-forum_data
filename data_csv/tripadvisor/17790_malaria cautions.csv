"Hi,Risk of malaria is very very low in sri lanka.Now SL is a malaria free country.But in several regions (specially Coloombo and suburbs) having threat of Dengue & usual advise is use a mos-repallent.BR+"
Okayy thankk youu
SL named as malaria free country. Use mosquito repellent and drink bottled water . :) Cheers!

I would add to the above bring mossie repellent with you as decent stuff is almost impossible to find here. Dengue is prevalent and there is something of an epidemic of it at the moment so it would be wise to take precautions against that.
