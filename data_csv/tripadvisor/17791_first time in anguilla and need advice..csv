"Hello, myself, husband and 2 kids (10/12) are trying to plan a last minute vacation to st maarten/anguilla. we would like to spend 3 nights on anguilla and 4 on st martin. we are abolute beach lovers and have raised our kids to be respectful of the islands and their natural beauty. We usually go to aruba in Feb because of the warm weather.  First, is the water temp warm in Anguilla in Feb.? Second, is the island kid friendly? we are not big partyers..just love the sun and fun and usually in bed by 11pm.\ Third, any advice on cheap hotel. condos (200-300)thank you for any and all advice. It is greatly appreciated."

"In response to the original poster, Anguilla is pretty expensive in February but you could check Allamanda, Nathan's Cove, Turtle's Nest and Elodia's for starters.The island is fairly kid-friendly in that there are a number of beautiful calm beaches for kids to play on and there are inexpensive places to eat, especially on Shoal Bay East during the day. "
"If all of MaryGG's great suggestions are not available, you can also try ""Easy Corner Villas"" but these are very modest accommodations at a cheap price, and, definitely NOT on the beach. You can always visit the beach on Cuisinart's property. They do not advertise the fact that all of AXA's beaches are open to the public. Your kids will find alot of other kids to romp with on this beach. Be sure to bring your own beach towels and chairs to sit on if you go to Cuisinart's beach. They are not going to offer anything to anyone that is not renting a room at their facility. Cove Bay beach is the choice of many Anguillan families for their children and also for those that are timid in the sea. Cove Bay is our favorite after Rendezvous Bay, and, beautiful with very calm water. Also, ""Smokeys"" is right on the eastern end of Cove Bay beach for a quick bite and a great Pina Colada + a live band on Saturday afternoons. Or, just go the public beach at Shoal Bay East as MaryGG suggested. Zabar"
thank you everyone. if i could bother you for other info. is the water temperature warm.(80's)and we have read other posts on the st martin site regarding dengue fever and the mosquito problem.Is it really that bad?? Is it epidemic proportions? thanks again. 
"We have been to Anguilla in Feb. 6 times....going on our 7th (not including other months we have been there.) We love to swim and snorkel if that tells you anything about the water temp. Of course the water is warmer in the summer months, but the water temp in Feb. is just fine...so don't worry ~ be happy!Take some Deep Woods Off or what ever works best for you and your family. The no see-ums in the evening are the worst...so make sure and have yourselves protected then. I am very allergic to bites, so I know there is nothing like prevention.Caicos;-)"
"Believe what Caicos has said. My wife is extremely sensitive to chilly water...the water in February is just fine, warmer in April and the warmest (80 degrees plus) in July. We have found that the water at Cove Bay beach is a little bit warmer. Maybe we're nuts, but we think so.I hate, I mean HATE biting insects because they LOVE me. At dinner, stay away from any restaurant that is in close proximity to a salt pond. Anguilla has never been a problem in any month of the year, as long as I spray my legs with any insect repellant that contains DEET. ""Deep Woods Off"" is the easiest to find and most effective economic product for me to use. Zabar"
"<thank you everyone. if i could bother you for other info. is the water temperature warm.(80's)and we have read other posts on the st martin site regarding dengue fever and the mosquito problem.Is it really that bad?? Is it epidemic proportions? thanks again.>We have been in Jan, Feb and March and lived in the water each time, temperature always seemed warm to us, and I don't go in our pool unless it is 80Â° - can't stand the cold.Regarding dengue fever, we went to Mexico for Thanksgiving and I was very worried about it; we used Deep Woods Off ""Sportman"" and Repel 100% Deet, had no problems at all with bites, unlike last year in AXA when I was covered in welts.Another tip I learned is to slather your feet in vaseline, wards off the ""noseeums"". It worked for me, although I had a lot of sand stuck to my feet! :-)Last year in AXA, my feet were on FIRE, I was carrying around a bottle of vinegar to stop the itching, and bought some Afterbite at Lakes, but the vinegar worked the best.Good Luck,Ellen"
"Whoa Ellen, one word for itching: camphophenique. Seriously, I grew up in South Florida BEFORE mosquito control -- it's the only thing my sainted grandmother would use & it still works. All these many, many years later, I still travel with it.Two words for sand fleas: Mosquito Milk. Available on the island; roll it on before dinner and bugs begone. "
"Now I am getting paranoid about the bugs. ""MaryGG"" - a question for you please? The product that you mentioned ""MOSQUITO MILK"" is made in Belgium by JAICO. For those interested, it is available for purchase on the Internet. Use Google to search for it. BUT it only contains 24% DEET. Why does it work better than products containing more DEET? Zabar"
"Don't know but it has always worked better than Off for us: maybe our problem was sand fleas & not mosquitoes or maybe it's the botanicals or maybe because it's a roll-on. Anyway, you can get it at the Anguilla Drugstore, the supermarkets, resort gift shops, & the pharmacy in the blue medical building on the main road. BTW, it's the ONLY repellent the pharmicist there recommends. "
"That ""blue"" building on the right side of the main road (heading West) anhd past South Hill, is the ""Hughes Medical Center"". I believe that their pharmacy is only open on weekdays, but perhaps the ""Paramount Pharmacy"" that is on the left side of the Main Road as you're heading East (just past the North Hill turn-off) also carries ""Mosquito Milk"". Zabar"
"Ellen,Thanks for pointing out that you want to buy the ""Sportsmen"" Deep Woods Off! I failed to add that word in my post. It has 30% deet instead of 25%, which the regular Deep Woods Off has. I am curious where you found 100% deet in Deep Woods Off ""Sportsmen.""I have tried Mosquito Milk and it did nothing for me...I still got eaten alive. That's why I always said ""whatever works best for you!""As far as the best relief for bites I use a Diprolene AF, which you need a prescription for, but is the BEST! The active ingredient is betamethasone. I get almost instant relief and the welts are gone in a few days. After that the highest percentage of over the counter cortizone cream works very well to stop the itch.Caicos;-)"
"Caicos: ""Repel"" 100% Deet - small green squirt bottle - get it at Walmart, I used the Deep Woods Sportsmen's Off in the daytime and the Repel at night and had no problems.I was really suffering in AXA last year, I could get no relief, finally I got the vinegar and a kind soul at RBH gave me some Claritin. When we went to MX, I had a medicine bag filled with benydryl liquid and caps, hydrocortosone cream and claritin and did not use any of it, thank heavens, but I will never be in that predicament again, and, I'm with you, whatever works!Not long for you now, you lucky dog...have a great trip!Ellen38 days"
"WOW thanks for all that info. Do you need to wear DEET during the daytime on the beach or just at night (out door eating) I hate to harp on the bug thing but I hate wearing bug spray and am concerned about putting in on 24 hrs a day. If its just at night, that's fine. Thank you all for the info, its so great to have a forum to ask questions and get GREAT advice.!! It is cold here in Buffalo!!!"
"I also heard that Jungle Juice works well too. I think you can get it at any outdoor sporting goods store. We'll arm up with a variety and see ""what works for us""!Thanks! On Ellen's note - 20 more days for us!"
