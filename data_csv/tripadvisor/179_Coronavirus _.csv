Anyone concerned with traveling to Vegas in the upcoming weeks because of the Coronavirus and large number of Chinese travelers?
Just another thing that is blown out of proportion.
Well starting tomorrow they won’t be able to or will have to be quarantined.
"DL, UA and AA have or will suspend most flights to China. DL is suspending all service Feb 6 to April 30. UA and AA are doing similar suspensions.Actually DL suspended all flights today. Last flight was from Detroit.Edited: 9:14 pm, February 01, 2020 "
"if i had a trip planned in the near future, no, the chinese coronavirus wouldn't concern me."
"It does not affect my travel plans, but it's not correct that it's being blown out of proportion."
You know what goes great with Corona Virus? Lyme disease
"Leaving next Saturday and staying at Palazzo and Wynn. At the start I was more concerned than I am now, everyone seems to be taking measures to contain it and stop it spreading.I'll take the same precautions I do when cruising, frequent hand washing avoiding people as much as I can ;-) and try to keep my hands away from my face and eyes."
"No, not at all. I’m not an alarmist."

"The thought of being quarantined for a week, scares me more than the virus."
"Not all that concerned about catching something in Las Vegas, but being cooped up with a potential carrier on the flight is a bit worrying. Seems like half the times I fly, I end up with some bug as it is."
^^^^ Cliffs notes version please? Is all of this going to be on the test?^

It’s almost a shame the post will likely disappear soon. It’s pretty funny.
"It's encouraging to have an apparently full-blown, fully trained albeit self-serving pathologist / infectious disease specialist share contributions here regarding this real and current world health situation . They must have the requisite training to make these claims because, after all, they maintain their own linked blog / website. I was unaware that this viral agent/ organism has its own spirit and can, simultaneously, distinguish between good and bad people. Good to know the OP cares.Thanks..."
"TA checked the OP's CV /resume, looks like.."
My error..it wasn't the OP's comments..it was #14's post ( who / which is no longer with us). My apologies to the OP....Quits...
"I'm not concerned about it at all.Every time there's a new strain of the flu/virus, hysteria breaks out. Tens of thousands of people die every year in the USA from the flu and flu related complications but nobody seems too worried about that.Good handwashing is the first line of defense against germs so wash your hands frequently, keep them away from your face and mouth and just enjoy your Vegas vacation!"
I understand that TI is going to re-open its Siren's Pirate Show with a new theme. Instead of scantily clad female pirates it's going to feature a cruise liner full of coronavirus scantily clad female quarantined passengers. It's going to feature a snot cannon. Make sure you bring your face mask to this show.
"As a physician, I'll say the same thing here as I do when patients ask me. The Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak is a significant story and is something the medical and scientific community find critically important. Not so much because of this specific virus, but as an opportunity to observe and evaluate our collective ability to manage such an outbreak. On an individual level, unless you recently traveled to specific regions of China, or have DIRECT and CLOSE contact, meaning share a home or direct working space (literally two people all day in one small office/room), then there is very little reason to be concerned about your personal risk.Even if you plan to travel, unless that travel is to an area of outbreak (again, specific regions of China), the risk is still incredibly low. People worry about places like Vegas because there are so many people from so many different places. But even IF someone with the virus presents to that area, the probability of any specific one other person there contracting it are infinitesimally small. I am far more concerned about seasonal influenza.Follow the story with an interest in international outbreak management. Do not follow it out of fear that you're next."
"""I am far more concerned about seasonal influenza.""I think a question is will the Coronavirus reach the critical mass to become part of next year's seasonal flu or will it just fade away due to outbreak management and hopefully a vaccine."
"""will the Coronavirus reach the critical mass to become part of next year's seasonal flu""Just to be clear: Wuhan Coronavirus is ENTIRELY different from Influenza. Influenza is a specific virus that presents with numerous different strains. Wuhan Corona is a completely different virus (coronavirus instead of influenza) of which there are also many strains. This is a single strain of coronavirus that has presented itself. There is no clear indication at this point as to how it will play out long term or seasonally. But it has nothing to do with influenza. And to the best of my knowledge, at the current time, there isn't even any discussion about considering a combined vaccine."
"""You know what goes great with Corona Virus? Lyme disease""Serious disease needs serious humor....post of the day, Well done."
"""and hopefully a vaccine.""Followed in short order by wackos on Facebook telling you not to use the vaccine but just rub some elderberry oil on your forehead. Stick it to Big Pharma!!!!"
"Post 25, no. Post 26, yes."
"Was there last weekend, nothing seemed different either in the air or on the ground, although every cough and sneeze heard on the plane was unnerving.."
Just been announced that it's now been named the Covid-19 virus.
Covid-19....I'm sure that will catch on with the masses. lol.
"“Covid-19,” wasn’t that the name of a boy-band from Australia, in the 1990’s?Hunt"
"Lol!Bill, if there were 19 of them then perhaps more likely to have been a Korean/K-pop boy band?: )"
YES I was/am very worried legitimate or paranoia (MANY with masks on)? We were there Feb 2-8 & was very concerned...since the Bellagio is decorated for Chinese New Year....
“ We were there Feb 2-8 & was very concerned...since the Bellagio is decorated for Chinese New Year....”And we all know Chinese New Year decorations spread viruses.
We are travelling to vegas from Canada the end of March I am a bit concerned.
"Just back from Vegas. There not leaving anyone in to Las Vegas who has travelled to China in the last 6 weeks. Everyone who were travelling on our plane had to sign a thing to say they haven't been to the country, and everyone was asked again going there Immagrations."
"My son is planning a trip to Las Vegas this week-end,very worried about the risk of contracting Corona virus"
"“ My son is planning a trip to Las Vegas this week-end,very worried about the risk of contracting Corona virus”Why? There hasn’t been a single reported case in Nevada. And only a couple dozen (?) in the entire country of 300+ million people. Worry about him drinking too much Corona and doing something stupid.Edited: 6:57 pm, February 17, 2020 "
">>There hasn’t been a single reported case in Nevada. And only a couple dozen (?) in the entire country of 300+ million people.<<<You'd think there would be more worrisome things for the worriers than Coronavirus. There is a significantly greater chance of getting murdered, or killed in a traffic accident in LV, yet no one seems to say that they are worried about that (although worriers probably are). Im not sure how some people are even able to leave their house each day?"
"I was in San Diego last week and the hospital released a patient that had it, and then readmitted the patient. The news at the time stated San Diego has 2 test positive and another 5 had results pending. I drove on with my plans of course. As stated above there are several other bad things more likely to occur."
">>I was in San Diego last week and the hospital released a patient that had it, and then readmitted the patient. The news at the time stated San Diego has 2 test positive and another 5 had results pending<<<Those are patients in quarantine at Miramar NAS."
^^ I heard that. The local TV news lead with a story about a positive patient being released but they were supposedly just released from the hospital back into quarantine.Nothing to worry about as far as I was concerned.
@GoodBeer Miramar hasn’t been a NAS in decades. It’s a Marine Corps Air Station now.
Just looking to see what Precautions for a ConAgg expo coming in March 2020. There are a lot of foreign attendees and wanted to know if we should be concerned.
stay away from Chinese restaurants because of interaction with friends or family that have recently flown in or vice a versa and stay away from casinos because you will find many chinese gambling there
"Stay away from Andrew F. You might catch a bad case of ignorance.Edited: 6:01 pm, February 25, 2020 "
Andy is a treasure trove of misinformation....
Definitely don’t touch the Chinese themed slot machines. 13
"Do NOT French kiss an unknown Chinese tourist - EVER!Enjoy,Hunt"
Or touch my Pangolin
"We were concerned about our trip to Las Vegas for ConExpo/Con/Agg also. We are not casino goers, however, the huge crowd of people at the Convention Center, monorails etc., both foreign and domestic puts me a little ill at ease. However, we have not changed our travel plans. Like everyone else, there is no need to panic and just practice safe health precautions as one does normally"
"If crowds are your concern, you should be safe taking the monorail."

"I canceled 3/13 - 3/15 Casa Blanca Resort, Mesquite, NV BECAUSE I COULD ! (Getting 100% money back -- no harm, no foul) ... fears ... and forgot about attending PAC 12 basketball tournament, T-mobile arena. Let's just say I had a very sleepless, panic- stricken night on 2/29 - 3/1. Remember the S Korea soccer game played in a completely empty stadium. New topic: Unable to IMMEDIATELY cancel (3 + 2) more nights at Sahara 3/15 -20 booked via free American Airlines freq flyer miles until their office opens Monday morning 3/2/20. I'll just wait and burn that bridge when I come to it. However, regular A.A. reservationist read me something: $150 fee to put the miles back into the account. Because I made THESE reservations in 2 pieces = $300 fee ... or I could just cancel and lose the points, ... or I could just go anyway after the basketball tournament ends and hang at the pool. Of course, I'll still have 2 pay an approx $38 resort fee per night, too. Booked at The Sahara; newly remodeled; their pool opens 3/5; free parking (i'll be driving.) Leaning towards avoiding the casino floor, the buses, the monorail, but there's no avoiding the elevators or the pools. (Remember the Chinese have a rule of no more than 4 people in the elevator !)"
After reading Thomas Q I'm thinking there's going to be some fantastic deals coming up for Las Vegas.
"It's actually a little hard to know what the eventual affect will be on Las Vegas. Some is obvious; Wynn will get fewer Asian visitors. And if it is enough to cause Wynn to lower rates, there will be a ripple effect.But of much greater concern is the effect on events, conventions and conferences. How many will cancel due to travel concerns or simply declining interest.Apple, Facebook & Google have already canceled participation in events in San Francisco recently. If this continues, we may see Vegas deals better than we have in a decade."
Coming to Vegas March 14th from Australia and worried our flight will get cancelled OR we get sick in Vegas. My kids don’t want me to go !
"At the current present, am not too particularly concerned at all.What does begin to worry me however, additional cases slowly cropping up within the U.S. But unless it becomes a vastly huge epidemic, all travel plans (everyone in the U.S.) are to continue on course."
"Posted this under the other coronavirus thread FWIW, I just got an email for a great deal in March from Caesars , usually offers are front forward, not in current month...I wonder if they are concerned ... I had booked with MGM back in January , as Caesars had no good offers."
"Going to Vegas to see Shania on the 24th of March. I am traveling from Texas so not too worried about plane. However, I do like slots and thats where I think the virus could fester since many people touch the screens. I will bring some pocket disinfectant wipes which should kill anything on the screen."
Forest Whitaker says that it's fine as long as you don't touch your face to surfaces with droplets.
"I am still going, Trump said the virus is a hoax by the Democrats."
Here’s a question are casinos allowing their patrons to wipe down the screens with wipes
Never seen so many people wearing masks. Rediculous !
"why do you care if people wear masks?a lot of times, they're doing it to keep their illness from effecting others. and even if they weren't, again, why do you care if people wear masks?"
"Yes, I am replying to my own post ! My 3 free nights at The Sahara 3/15 - 3/18 is 100% non-refundable. It would be 12,900 miles down the drain if I chicken out and stay home. My (consecutive) 2nd stay 3/18 - 3/20 at The (same) Sahara in Las Vegas isn't necessarily non-cancellable. It is using a lot more miles: 16,800 miles for just two more nights. If I wanted to cancel it, I would have to pay $150 of real money to put the miles back in my account (no way jose.) I would never do that anyway. So, as it stands now, I am going.I know how to sneak into the pools at Caesars Palace and NY, NY. They would be better pools than The Sahara. So, how to get over there ? Monorail, bus, drive, or coronavirus. Leaning towards wearing rubber gloves and taking the monorail for Caesars Palace. For NY, NY, I would drive, park for free at NY, NY. Ihave an active M-Life credit card = (something like) Sapphire Level M Life = free parking.So, I'll take all precautions, especially when paying for items with credit card or currency. I'll walk around with my hand sanitizer and umbrella (I wilt in the sun.) Also, I'm dieting, and have to drive to grocery stores, and consume mass quantities of (has to be) seltzer water or as they say south of the border: ""agua con gas !"""
shouldn't we be more concerned about travel in the next few months ?
As of mid last week in my province in Canada with a population of 5 million people and a handful of confirmed cases there had been over 1300 tests for the virus. At the same time for all of the US there had been under 500 tests. That’s crazy.
I am on way to Vegas next week...and last week of April is scheduled. Not sure why Vegas would be any greater risk than the tourist filled South Florida area where I live.... much bigger risk for me from all of the old Canadian snowbirds driving here than Coronavirus.
I would be concerned. Coronavirus is so much deadlier than the seasonal flu. And some worry more about losing free nights at a hotel and miles.
"i'm not old or immunocompromised, so i think i'll save my concern for other things, and do everything else i've always done to avoid getting sick. you know, like the cdc says and stuff."
"The biggest concern I have with the virus (for me personally) is the threat of quarantine. It would suck being stuck quarantined for 14 days in Las Vegas. I dont like the time I spend in a LV hotel room now, cant imagine being in a place I love visiting and not being able to enjoy it. That said, I have plans for LV over Easter and have no plans on changing anything.Edited: 11:39 am, March 04, 2020 "
I heard the coronavirus successfully executed the $20 trick at The Flamingo last week so it’s acclimating nicely with our society. 13
HiWe are planning to travel to Las Vegas on March 7-10. Is it recommended or we cancel it?Thanks
what a great question
sum...seems like an over reaction to me at this point in time.
"Be there in 4 sleeps.I'm wearing gloves that I have affixed Velcro to which will hold my sanitization wipe while playing slots. Ok, not really, but will be washing my hands much more frequently this trip. I'm not worried but it's a small inconvenience to help from getting it.What happens when the first case is reported in Vegas? Yikes.Edited: 5:29 pm, March 04, 2020 "

"Travelling from the UK 19 March. 4 nights Las Vegas, 2 Nights Grand Canyon Western Ranch. 4 nights Los Angeles then supposed to be on a cruise to Mexico. Worries......the flights and actually getting there. Being quarantined thousands of miles from home!!!!! Not particularly worried about Vegas. Exceptional worries about the cruise and thinking of not showing on this."
"Cruise would be my worry, any cruise is normally an open field to illness regardless.Wouldn't worry about flights, I can't see them stopping travel.Due to travel myself in April but I've no concerns as it stands."
Travelling from Heathrow to Vegas for two weeks on 24 March; a little bit concerned at the panic escalation but not at all worried about being quarantined in my Bellagio penthouse as long as room service appear on a regular basis with my wine refills
"This was the first response in this thread, ""Just another thing that is blown out of proportion.""Not a great call."
Just got a 24 month credit for the cruise i just cancelled. No way would i go on a boat.
They throw you out of the hotel if they know you’re sick. You’ll go to an Air Force base to quarantine for a month. Enjoy that.
"I’m sure I can rely on my American cousins to look after me, Bill D"
"""Just another thing that is blown out of proportion.""You really think so?"
"^^^ I didn't say it, I just quoted it. I was surprised when I first read it; at that time it seemed to soon to say and now it seems just plain wrong.Edited: 11:17 am, March 05, 2020 "
heck yeah --probably be the first year in 20 that I've missed opening tip at the mirage sports book..damn it
I mean i think it would be insane to go over there now that Nevada has said the virus is there.
"""Just another thing that is blown out of proportion.""...I totally agree! Hysteria seems to break out after every new virus/infection scare. Just add Coronavirus to the list of Sars, H1N1, Ebola, etc. In 6 - 12 months, you wont even hear about this again.Good handwashing people...and keep your hands away from your face, mouth or eyes.ENJOY your Vegas vacation!!"
"No one is saying (or I'm not) it's the apocalypse, however it's a serious matter. Of course if you don't have older parents or grandparents I guess one might not give a fig."
"It takes up to 14 days or more for symptoms to develop. So if locally transmitted cases are showing up now, it's been around for at least a few weeks. Slot machines, dice, chips and money are petri dishes of germs. They're touched by many people and they don't get disinfected. People sit close enough at table games and in theaters to exchange plenty of droplets. There are countless employees in close contact with many people, from dealers, to servers, to front desk staff. Customers come from all over the world, potentially bringing bad strains of coronavirus with them to Las Vegas. And everybody is smoking in casinos, whether actively or passively. So people's respiratory systems are already challenged.I recently posted a sarcastic response (long since deleted) about how there's nothing to worry about because a certain government official wishfully thinks it will blow over in April. But quite seriously, there isn't enough known about the virus (or viruses) to confidently assume that it won't happen to you or me, or if it does, whether it will be just like a cold, or a serious fight for life.There are at least two varieties of this coronavirus. One is especially virulent, and has proven fatal to otherwise healthy young people, like Dr. Li Wenliang, the original whistle blower about the coronavirus in Wu Han, China. Nobody should become complacent, as you can't know how it will affect you until you get it -- I hope you don't!Some posters here think they won't get it in Las Vegas, and/or if they do get it, it won't be too bad. Perhaps they're right. But if it starts spreading in Las Vegas, casinos could be the most dangerous places in town. Once it starts spreading, everybody who has spent time in casinos where people with verified cases of the virus either worked or visited, will at least have a roughly two week period of worrying.So do what you're gonna do, but don't feel invincible and take foolish risks. Because viruses are equal opportunity bugs and you don't want to play Las Vegas Roulette with your health!"
Recent case identified in Toronto of someone just back from Vegas. They were at an international convention.
^^^ source? I've yet to read that on any of my usual canadian news providers
Me either
“ Recent case identified in Toronto of someone just back from Vegas. ”And of course “ just back” means they could have had it before they leftToronto...
"And of course “ just back” means they could have had it before they leftToronto...Hence they could,have passed it all over Las Vegas , without knowing ...incubation period is 14 days , if you believe the alleged experts"
"Well, at least there has not been any outbreak of the Budweiser, or Coors Light Virus - yet!Hunt"
Maybe Mac has some inside source? I can't find any information about his claim. All Toronto cases I see are tied to overseas and a cruise

"Larry Kudlow, Trump mouthpiece, just said Coronavirus is contained...So Viva Las Vegas! ...."
"The cruise ships are good indicators of what the virus does/does not do as they are basically self contained test areas. Off all the people on a ship who were infected, less than 1% died. Most didn't catch the virus, of those who did, most had no symptoms. Of the people that did die, they were all over 70 and most likely had other health probablems. So basically we are dealing with a slightly more communicable cousin to the flu that might actually produce less symptoms and kill less people. The only difference is the media is really really hyping this. I guess with the dozen failed Trump scandals they have to find their sensational stories elsewhere lest the public become aware of how full of crap they are."
"It's the media, it's the media. They're just trying to get the president. Please. It's facts and information we need and I don't know where you're going to get it except from the news media. It sure isn't coming from the White House.Edited: 10:33 am, March 06, 2020 "

That’s what you get when you fight for audiences. I do have some faith in our medical establishment. Our medical establishment both public and private are fairly congruent in that it’s a serious concern but with a few precautions, this is a manageable health event. If LV strip becomes the next King Co. Washington, I might be concerned about spending a week there. You just don’t know if 20-30 cases turn into 300 cases. I at the very least want accurate info so I can make a good decision. Left wing or right wing sources on this doesn’t matter. As long as they source it accurately. It’s certainly more concerning than the common flu. Again that said, Our April Easter plans have not changed. “poured some money into the casino on Wall Street“. If you can’t tell the difference between investing and gambling then you have no business commenting on either.Edited: 11:18 am, March 06, 2020 "
Mass panic spread by the media. Yes it can be deadly if you're old got a compromised immune system. You're more likely to pass the disease onto others.Do not worry do not panic just follower normal hygiene practices.I wonder if the media spread words of climate change as much as this virus would more people care?
Not too worried. Headed there on April 15th. Just going to make sure I wash my hands frequently and keep hand sanitizer on my for when I’m not close to a sink.

It's being well hyped in the media here in the UK too. Looks like our big events will end up either being cancelled or sports events being played behind closed doors.

"We live in BC, Canada - where there are already about 15-20 confirmed cases. We are going to LV at the end of the month. We've bought a hefty travel insurance policy. The only way we are NOT going is if the government advises us not to, like they have advised not to go to China or Iran. To be honest, I'm not scared of getting the virus, I'm sure I wont die as I am in my late 30's and in generally good health. My main fear is I pass it along to someone who is vulnerable, and If I do get it I will have to go into quarantine for 2 weeks and I can't really afford to miss 2 weeks of work. My advice, get good insurance, wash your hands and listen to what the government officials say (in Canada at least).Edited: 3:55 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"With the spread of Coronavirus to Nevada does that now change your plans, so far no spread to Las Vegas"
"Of course not. Did you think there weren't going to be cases in Nevada? Do you think there is any state that won't have cases?While there may be some panic that is overblown, it is also unrealistic to think this will be contained to a few areas."
Just sanitise your hands and fingers immediately after using the airport fingerprint virus spreaders.
"Be careful which hand-sanitizers you use! Up to half of those on the market don't contain the CDC recommeded 60% alcohol needed to kill viruses.As an aside, they'll only work so well. Unless you are fully concentrating, you'd be amazed how often you touch you face."

"I am . Not because of Chinese visitors, just because it involves large crowds together in confined spaces. I am going to see Bruno Mars at the end of April and I am a bit worried. Could shows get cancelled due to "" social distancing ""?"
"Yes they can and in fact it's already happening in some parts of the country. SXSW, a massive festival in Texas was just cancelled. This likely will occur often in the next few months."
"The NCAA held a conference call last week for it's members. They are making contingency plans to hold the March Madness games in empty stadiums. How likely? They don't know, they speculated between a 0 and 50 percent chance with it being ""closer to 50 than zero.""Edited: 11:08 pm, March 08, 2020 "
Me too!
"This virus isn’t about you getting sick and or death for most, it’s about passing a virus along to the sick and elderly that will cause them to die a horrible death. If you feel the need to go anywhere, stay away from the sick or elderly so you don’t give them a death sentence. Most younger people with the virus have little or no signs of it. Social distancing needs to be happening now."
"Bill D , excellent post...."
"I saw this post when it began on Feb 1st and thought Coronavirus is not going to keep me away from Vegas. Fast forward -and today I have just cancelled. Vegas is a gambling town and we all place our own bets. I am not worried about getting very sick but I can’t risk the possibility of getting stuck, quarantined, or passing something along to those I love. At this point, I can get a full refund on almost everything -so I fold. Best of luck to everyone else still in the game!"
"“If you feel the need to go anywhere, stay away from the sick or elderly so you don’t give them a death sentence.“ - what a backwards view this is. Perhaps the sick or elderly should be the ones to not go anywhere. Doesn’t that make more sense? Of course it does. 13"
"How about both? I personally have no fear for my health, but I have 2 elderly parents and a good friend who is immuno-comprimised. So yeah they need to practice caution, but I do too to keep them safe. Remember, you can be contagious up to 14 days before showing symptoms. Until we finally get community wide testing a little caution is prudent."
"I understand and agree with your point Upstate_Guy14, I was just pointing out the absurdity of that comment that was made. The most common sense approach is for at-risk folks to isolate themselves because you cannot trust that others are taking the right precautions. It was an asinine statement. 13"
"Another good post by both upstate and DerbyRam...the possibility of a healthy person being adversely affected is low, but being disrupted or passing it along is significant ...Why risk it, particularly if you need to fly in...If I could drive in, might be less of a concern"
"Another consideration is that there's a real fear that our medical infrastructure could be overwhelmed should this become a widespread pandemic. The so called death rate isn't fixed odds like a roll of the dice. Intense medical care plays a significant role. Should you find yourself somewhere where there's suddenly tens of thousands of cases at once, you won't get that care.This is why even though it's looking like containment failed, efforts to slow it's spread are so crucial. It's why it's becoming more likely concerts and events are going to be cancelled in increasing numbers, sporting events like March Madness will play in front of empty arenas if not cancelled entirely.Edited: 1:35 pm, March 09, 2020 "
If March Madness ends up happening in empty arenas - the revenue lost will be crippling .
Employers lose an estimated $13B in productivity during March Madness.
"The NCAA makes $800M on their tv deals....hardly crippling.Edited: 1:52 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Wasn't really worried about the NCAA losing money - more like the local cities that host the games who have hotel rooms reserved, restaurants booked, that would lose that revenue."
yes i am concerned and have cancelled my May las vegas trip
"I can drive to LV so I might go, but I'd like to see a real reduction in rates. I had planned to buy a plane ticket to Chicago in May but am currently on hold to wait and see. As with many I'm not so afraid of the virus as much as being hassled with potential flight delays, flight cancellations and at a worst case quarantine."
"This thread is over a month old now and Covid-19 has hardly spread in Las Vegas in that time.I go in another months time and if it’s spreading at the same rate there might be 3-4 infections by then.The flights won’t get cancelled- even though Italy, and specifically Milan is supposedly in a travel lockdown, I can still fly there from my local UK airport for £35 return, so that ‘lockdown’ is fake news"
"So I'm due to fly into Vegas for a 3 week road trip in July to celebrate my 30th and up until the last few days, I sort of laughed at the possibility of the situation getting bad enough to worry me however with things escalating very quickly, I've taken out a comprehensive insurance policy at the weekend.I'm now debating whether to continue to book things in case the worst happens and we aren't able to fly in July. If I were to bet on it, I don't think it will be bad enough that air travel is stopped but for the first time, it's made me a little concerned!"
"""Just another thing that is blown out of proportion."" - Well, this hasn't aged very well.13"
"It is under control, said the windbag in the WH a few weeks ago..it is NOT inevitable to spread, he bloviated...."
"""'Just another thing that is blown out of proportion.'- Well, this hasn't aged very well.""I pointed this out a few days ago. For those that don't know, we're talking about post #1 in this thread."
"Qdog, I'm getting the impression you are not entirely satisfied with the current administration."
"The Ivies have cancelled their tournament. Right now, there's a 50/50 chance, I'd say, of the tournament going on. They could ostensibly cancel the women's tournament, but since that would conflict with Title IX, they'd also have to cancel the mens. Stanford will not send their band to Vegas this week, the way they did to the women's tournament last week."
"I wasn't concerned a week ago, but everyday you hear of more outbreaks on the news. We're going to a heavily populated city, so now I'm a little worried, more about flying, being in an enclosed area with recirculating air. But I'm going to a wedding at Caesars Palace, so unless the couple cancels, we're going."
"^^The good thing is you can worry less about the airplane ride...For some reason they are saying the recirculating air system can help you, though in an airplane, you are way closer together than the 3 to 6 feet the CDC suggests staying away from people. Go figure!13"
"""...being in an enclosed area with recirculating air...""It's not the air that appears to be the problem. It's the surfaces."
"The chance of getting Covid -19 is very slim, but disruptions to life is very likely...better to be precautionary, then not"
"Just imagine the looks someone is gonna get at the first sneeze of the flight. If you want that Southwest middle seat left open, sneeze when the first person looks at it during boarding."
"One of the thing epidemiologists consider when calculating the likelihood of catching a disease is the geographical footprint. Simply put, how large is the range of people you might be exposed to? For example, if you live in an isolated area without many outside visitors, the footprint is small and you have a lower risk of contracting the illness.Two places with about as large a footprint as you will find anywhere in the world are airports and of course Las Vegas, where people all over the world gather in a high density environment. I was gonna say it's a matter of when and not if Las Vegas becomes a vector for COVID-19, but the scary thing is it probably already is and we just don't know it yet.If you have a trip planned in the next 4 weeks, you really need to cancel, at least until we achieve meaningful testing. If you have a trip in April you should be prepared to cancel as well."
"The lab my wife works for is getting samples from people who might be infected. If she isn't scared, why should I be?"
"Your wife is working in a controlled environment where every sensible precaution is taken. Las Vegas and many others are as yet taking none. Social distancing, particularly away from high density and high risk areas, washing of hands and face, and getting tested. Do that and yes, there's no reason to panic. At least as long as access to proper health care is available. That's all I'm saying. Avoiding Vegas for the next few months is part of it."
Perhaps your wife should have a televised press conference and put America at ease:)
"DTC, you don’t feel at ease with the carnival barker in the WH telling everyone it is contained 2 weeks ago? Or him spewing drivel such as it is NOT inevitable it will spread? I feel very safe...."
"As you try to sleep, you will not think about the last person who laid on your hotel bed pillow was?"
The President has put out a travel ban from European countries(with some restrictions)...too late. Do something about testing- that's the priority.
"Looking for specifics on the EU travel ban to the US. It applies to the 26 countries comprising the Schengen zone, where there is freedom of movement across borders. The ban is for 30 days, starting midnight Friday, March 13th.One news article mentions that the travel ban applies also to anyone who has been in the Schengen zone within 14 days prior to the ban.Anyone with better information can correct what I've been reading."
Why go to news articles instead of the official source?https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homeland…
"rallen2018, that is correct, but how they gonna know if anyone did a boozecruise/ fag run last week??"
"""Can anyone explain why so few samples/tests have been collected?""Current Administration incompetence; anti-science in general, filled with sycophants and yes-men and enabled by Fox State News.You asked."
NYS has been ready to do mass testing for over a week but were waiting on CDC approval that inexplicably only came yesterday. I'm avoiding the political so make your own conclusions.What it does mean is that now that we finally are getting up to speed the rise in cases next week might be staggering.
Disneyland closing. But a few here will still say media and mass hysteria. How wrong can you be?
I am older and definitely not going until I get the all clear.
"It is the media’s fault! Coronavirus is contained ! Keep drinking the koolaid... imagine if a certain person actually acted presidential,and was straight up with the citizens ..instead of saying all is contained and the tests are beautiful...before the lovers pounce, I am a GOP supporter, who see thrum this nonsense he spouts"

lots of teachers are over 60. it's not just about students.
teachers claim it is always only about the students. even when they go on strike.
"Nursing homes here in NY are in virtual lock down. Not even family allowed. All staff has to account for all travel and temperatures checked regularly.Which is understandable.

"I have cancelled. I posted 1 week ago that I was going, unless the advice from our government and chief medical officer was to not travel. Well, yesterday it was advised that any Canadian that left the country would be advised to undergo 2 weeks of self quarantine upon their return. I am not willing to do 2 weeks of self quarantine. Also, most things are closing in Las Vegas from what I understand. We had NHL tickets and Cirque tickets for O - who knows if that show will be up and running by the time we showed up (end of March). Also, we simply do not trust the way the American government is handling the situation compared to other countries - no urgency to get people tested, no responsibility being taken, etc. Simply not worth the risk. I am disappointed, but it is for the best. 1 week ago I really didn't think it would come to this, but that is how fast this virus spreads. For those that do go, I hope you have a good time, and you stay healthy. I will return once this virus thing ""burns itself out"".Edited: 9:49 pm, March 13, 2020 "

I will take the abuse from this site. but this is no worse then the swine flu when Obama was president. But since Trump is president the media Magnifies it 10 fold . Everyone just slow down and take a deep breath. Have the so called top notch Dr's have a cure for the common cold or Flu No. LYes the Corona Virus is a different but in reality its no worse than the Swine flu and we got past that with out all the hoop la

There was a vaccine for the swine flu.This thing is just starting. Who knows where it will go?The flu is seasonal. The Coronavirus is an unknown and people fear the unknown. Comparing the two makes no sense.

I am very relieved to be home. I will not be going out for 2 weeks because I was around so many people of different nationalities in Vegas. Just sharing my experience.

"Irish Fan - No. The Canadian government has advised ALL international travellers, returning to Canada (regardless of where you have travelled to) have been advised to self quarantine for 2 weeks. My post is NOT an attack on the government of the United States. It is simply the reason why I am not going to Las Vegas. Why can you not understand that? If the US government advised you not to travel internationally, would you ignore that advice? I think you would not. Agree?"
"Some provinces in Canada have asked, not required, people coming back from abroad to self-quarantine for 14 days. Nova Scotia asked doctors and students, in particular."

"Although I initially felt that the media has over blown the pandemic by causing massive hysteria regarding this virus, I have decided to cancel all my travel plans for the next three months. I feel by that time it will present a better understanding of the severity and containment of the virus by using proactive methods to reduce the spread of it. I happen to be one of those who don't usually survive it after exposure and development of illness from it. Better to be safe than dead."
“ I happen to be one of those who don't usually survive it after exposure and development of illness from it. ”You’ve already died???
"Irish, it was only his first post. I'm sure he will learn from it."
"The R naught of a disease is the measurement of how contagious a disease is. The number basically means how many people a carrier is expected to infect absent any baseline precautions or measures. Two numbers matter. An R naught (It's written with an R then a subscript zero but we can't here) level of 1 means it can sustain itself indefinitely in a population. Anything less, say .7 means it will die out on it's own. When doctors say they are trying to contain a disease with preventative measures, what they mean is they artificially want to lower it's R naught to under 1. (China, at least temporarily say they succeeding doing this with COVID-19.)The second scarier number is 2. At this level or above it means the disease is capable of exponential growth and the numbers explode in a population if unchecked. Doing preventative measures to get in under 2 is called mitigation. It is what we're trying to do now.The common flu is about 1.3 to 1.5. With a vaccine it's usually lowered to just above 1. As warm weather hits it falls well under 1.Swine flu is 1.6. Yes it is far more deadly, but that actually makes containment easier, as does the fact that you can only pass it one day before you show symptoms. So it simply won't spread too quickly in a population. And of course we now have a vaccine.COVID-19 is around 2.2 to 3.1 (It'll be a while before we know exactly) Yes it is less deadly than swine flu, but it spreads far far faster than swine flu. The second issue is that preventative measures are tougher because you can pass it 9-14 days before falling ill. Lack of testing makes it virtually impossible.Comparing then Swine flu to COVID-19 is like comparing plane crashes to car accidents. When they happen plane crashes are far deadlier, but when looking at the population as a whole car crashes are a massively bigger threat to peoples lives."
Shorter version: Quit being obtuse Lance.
"Don't think so! I have 622 acres of land surrounding my home that is full of forest and hay. Trails to ride, game to hunt and fishing out of my back door.
