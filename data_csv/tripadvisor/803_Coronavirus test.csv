Hi has anybody arrived in Cyprus today that has had the NHS test and been allowed to carry on with there holiday?
Hi everyone - just to let everyone know we arrived on the first ba flight this morning - was so nice and easy and much less stressful than I thought! My husband and myself and two young girls all have the NHS COVID tests done 72 hours (so we did it on Wednesday morning) before travelling (Ofcourse we negative) arrived and all was very orderly - they check your temperature and check all the documents - please make sure you have the time and date of the nhs test as well as the result - everyone was lovely and very nice!
How did you present the time and date? Every NHS test result I’ve seen has been a rubbish text message that they’d never accept.
From the Cyprus Embassy in London website:1) NHS TESTSNHS test for #covid19 will be accepted in order to travel from UK to Cyprus. Travellers with negative NHS test need to have both their NHS test appointment booking and the NHS COVID-19 negative result notification. Result not more than 72hours before departure.
You need to take a copy of your appointment email as well as the result one. This was confirmed yesterday by the minister of transport in Cyprus.
Thank you for that - very helpful:o)
I belong to one of the defined passenger categories who have the option to request a COVID-19 test to be carried out on arrival in the Republic Cyprus (Category B Countries)This is what it says on the Quick Check section of the travel pass application page - so can you go without a test and be tested there?I'm sorry but I'm finding it very confusing.
"Is it 72 hours before local time of arrival in Cyprus? How busy was your flight? ThanksEdited: 11:32 am, August 01, 2020 "
"paulaf, it is 72hrs before departure. This is pretty consistent across official Cypriot websites."
"PaulaF full details are in flightpass, its72 hrs before departureWhy would the arrival time have anything to do with a test taken before departure? what if the destination was China or Australia?"
Because there is about a 4 hour difference between the 2 times so I didn't want to get it wrong thanks.
Glad you arrived safely and the process was straightforward for you. Can I ask when you booked your NHS test did you click no symptoms/othER? Thank you.
Hi. Yes we have the nhs test arrived last night. Had to have a Covid year upon arrival also
The actual results send back so not have a date and time but your appointment for the drive through test does. Keep a copy. When you fill in the CFP. It asks this
The above info is correct
What happens if your flight is delayed?
I did an at home NHS test that has come back negative! However there is no date or time on the email and as I did the test at home I have no appointment date or time to show!! What do I do? Flying tomorrow and so stressed out! Help
No one can help unless you have official confirmation of the time and date the test took place.If you can’t get a Cyprus flight pass completed at least 3 hours before your flight time then you have two choices1. Don’t goOr2. Pay the 300 euro per person fine and the cost of a test when you land
Hi where did you get tested they say you can only get a NHS test if you are showing symptoms. Going in 3 weeks any help would be appreciated
