"Hi All.Our flight is due for this 26th February 2020. We will be flying from Malaysia to Cambodia.Is it ok to travel wrt the Coronavirus or should we postpone?Please help, I don't know what to do..."
"no-one here can offer you a definitive answeryou will just have to monitor the situation, and make your decision based upon advice from your government re travel warnings, your insurance company re their willingness to pay out in the event of something awful and health alerts from organisations like the World Health Organisation.Today, 6th Feb I would still be travelling but in 3 weeks who knows how things will have changed (for better or worse) I hope your insurance will cover cancellations - check their fine print"
There have been more Coronavirus cases in Malaysia than Cambodia.
"Hi JennyI realise and understand that whether to cancel or proceed with travel arrangements just now is a difficult decision many people have to face. However, all you can do is continue to monitor the available information and make your own decision. This is a situation where nobody else can decide for you."
"I agree with #2, at the moment I don't think you are any more at risk in Cambodia than Malaysia. Possibly you could say that there is the risk from being confined on a plane, but that's no worse than normal public transport in somewhere like KL.What I would say is to ensure your travel insurance covers medical evacuation, the health facilities in Cambodia are a long way from world class."
"If you are worrying about it, you should cancel your tripIf you do go, you will just be worrying all the time won't you ?, rather than enjoying your trip"
Hello Jenny Take note of the last paragraph of POST 4 that can't be emphasized enoughHappy Travels
"I personally would like to cancel my trip. However, I booked a lot of tickets with Air Asia and spent quite some money. If i cancel now, I will lose everything. That's why I am asking around to see if anyone has maybe a little bit more information than I do. But thank you for your advice :)"
"If you want to cancel your trip, then just cancel it"
"Postponing your trip would be an ideal solution. However, I fear that it will be unlikely for Air Asia to agree to do so. Hopefully I’m wrong, but all you can do is to give it a try."
I thought one can change dates even with the cheap tickets for a change fee plus fare difference. You may want to look into that and delay your trip for several months at the least.https:/…
"Hello Jenny TAll Malaysian airlines are giving full refunds for cancellations to CHINAincluding HK and Macau and also from CHINA ONLYAirasia flights to Wuhan will remain suspended until Feb 29 at this moment in time, and they are offering basically this as follows, but this will probably be of little use to youPassengers scheduled to fly into or from those places can change their flight free of any fees up to March 1They can op to fly on another day on the same route up to 30 days from the date of the original ticketThis includes those affected by cancelled flights or imposed travel restrictionsThe full refund to Chinese destinations on Airasia applies to tickets booked prior to 28 Jan and lasts until Mar 1If you are a member of the Airasia BIG loyalty scheme, you can retain the fare value and load the credit into your account for future use, you have 90 days to use itNormal refunds if any Ha Ha Ha and flight change policy / fees are in force for ""ALL"" other destinationsMalaysian and Malindo are in my opinion a little better with what they are offering, especially the dates of booking and length of claiming timeBut basically Jenny if you are not booked to travel to China I cant see much hope for youThis about the gist of it at the moment I thinkGood luck all the sameHappy TravelsEdited: 8:21 am, February 08, 2020 "
