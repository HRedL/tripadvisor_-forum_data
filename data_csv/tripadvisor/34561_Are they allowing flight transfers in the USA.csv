You'll have to go through US immigration whether you are transit or not. So you'll need to be able to legally enter the US.
"Hi Emily,One thing to be clear in case you're unaware, is that in order to transfer flights in the USA, you have to completely enter the country. Even if your next flight takes you back out of the country. Unlike some parts of the world, you can't just go from plane to plane when coming from abroad and flying out to another country. So if you are not a US or Canadian citizen/resident/passport holder then you would either need a Visa or an ESTA depending on what passport(s) you hold. That aside, the current list of COVID19 regulations for non-citizens can be found on the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website:https:/â€¦from-other-countries.htmlEdited: 5:40 pm, June 22, 2020 "
Ecuadorean citizens are not eligible for an ESTA. You would be required to obtain a US Visa.

There are no pandemic restrictions regarding flights from Mexico but you will need a visa to enter the USA. If you can go through Mexico City it will be better.
Transfers in the USA are always a pain during normal times since the traveler has to clear immigration and customs. Going through a non-US port is preferred.
"There are no flights for OP that don't transit thought the US but on Interjet, that I saw. And it shows no availability until 16 July."
