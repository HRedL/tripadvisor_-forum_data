I have an opportunity to live in Bali for 4-6 months and want to bring my two small dogs with me. Can anyone tell me what the rules are? I don't want to risk them staying in quarantine the whole time I'm there.Thanks
There will of course be entry requirements and your best bet would be to contact the Indonesian Embassy in your own country to find out what is required.Best wishes.
"Okay, this is an Italian website, but it's an Indonesia Embassy website which gives you some idea of what you're up against:embassyofindonesia.it/animal-quarantine-requâ€¦"
There is a rabies epidemic in Bali. There are plenty of dogs needing temporary adoption from animal welfare centres. Bali has a few hundred thousand more dogs than it really needs. Travelling is very stressful for dogs. Maybe this is not a great idea.
"It is certainly not a good idea. You are only going for 4-6 months, there will be quarantine from both ends and your dogs will suffer. Leave them home for a while, it is much safer and less stressful for them.My friends have 'lost' many dogs in Bali."
"Hi,I would be concerned upon returning to the US as Bali is currently suffering a rabies outbreak, could the US authorities quarantine your dogs or worse...Even getting them to Bali with all the paperwork in order could be tough."
There is no doubt on this. Currently you can not bring your dogs into Bali.
At present you at not allowed to bring any domestic animals into Bali due to the Rabis epidemic. A poor guy got his little cat destroyed the other day when he turned up with it from Java.
A very bad idea considering the seriousness of the rabies outbreak right now.
"and I thought Quarrantine was something like 3 months.....maybe not, however I agree with the others, with the rabies epidemic, why would you bother?I don't think animals have our concept of time. They would be much better at home with a carer."
"The OP might suggest that as her dogs would have been vaccinated in US rabies is not an issue. Even if the Balinese govt was allowing dogs in , there other issues still remain. Such as the stress of air travel on dogs, as well as other diseases and issues that could arise for them here."
