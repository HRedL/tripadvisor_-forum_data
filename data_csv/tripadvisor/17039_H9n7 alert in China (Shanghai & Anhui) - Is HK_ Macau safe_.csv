H9n7 alert in China (Shanghai & Anhui) - Is HK/ Macau safe?
This is not a widespread disease yet. I live here and I am not fleeing yet. Just exercise good hygiene and avoid touching live birds and their droppings.
We heard that two men have died in Shanghai and a woman is being treated in Anhui.
"I'm ok but the thing is, I'm bringing my 8 months old baby along and I'm worried babies have lower immunity. I try to postpone my trip but it is not covered under travel insurance & SIA refused to postpone my trip. And I cannot find someone else to take care of my baby too"
"ya marj, I check out my country's ministry of health & ministry of foreign affairs. Both of them are not issuing any travel advisory or health advisory as yet. WHO just updated 1 April 2013 www.who.int/csr/don/2013_04_01/en/index.html"
As sammy said I think you are generally safe if you don't come into contact with live birds or their droppings. The news said it is a sub type not previously transmitted to humans. I haven't heard anything to suggest there is a human to human risk of transfer.We will be in Shanghai in a couple of weeks time and it doesn't put me off going. In my opinion it should be easier to protect a baby but you should speak to your doctor for your own peace of mind.I remember a flight from Vietnam some years ago when there was an Avian flu scare and no-one on the 'plane would have the chicken option. :-)
ya i will prob bring him along. already paid for everything. but i will probably tweak my plans i.e. take out the peak and ocean park.
"Watch the news and see what developments are reported to help peace of mind and checking your national health ministry for travel advisory is absolutely good advice. However, I don't think its something to worry much about at this point in time. Happy travels when you are in HK and Macau."
"Being concerned about safety in HK/ Macau because of infectious diseases in Shanghai and Anhui is the same as worrying about the situation in Singapore because of what is happening in Sri Lanka or East Timor.I'm not saying it's wrong to be concerned for your child's health, but some geographical perspective can come in handy ;-)"
But is shanghai safe?? I will be going in may to places like Su Zhou as well
"For heaven's sake, it is more than 1500 km from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Look at a map and stop being hysterical."
But is shanghai safe?? I am going to shanghai and Su Zhou in may.
Would be best To ask on the shanghai forum Not the hk Forum.
"*sighs deeply*NOBODY knows what the bird (or any other) flu situation ANYWHERE is going to be like by next month, any more than anyone knows when or where the world's next major earthquake will be, or next week's rainfall."
"Don't go if you are going to feel uneasy though. We (a bunch of people who you don't even know) cannot tell you what will happen, so we certainly shouldn't be responsible for your decision."
"I think it should not be of big concern at present. Simple common sense and good hygiene practices prevail.This is an evolving event so of course things will change - as of now there's no serious concerns.Again, as SammyFloyd says, it is your own judgement as to whether you're confident enough to make the travel."
I think there's more risk driving with Chinese taxi drivers! :-)
"chill people. I'm only asking a question to ask those in hk/macau what's the situation like? over here in sg over hundred kms away, I can only rely on media reports & updates on WHO. of course, you will not be & I can't compel you to be responsible for any remarks people may make here. why get so worked up? I already said I'm cool, just concerned as a mother if I should leave my baby behind or bring him along."
"Maybe, as suggested by SydneyNick, a look at a map would help to dispel a lot of worries ;-)I mean, how would posters on the Singapore forum react if people said they were frightened of going there because there have been deaths from MDR tuberculosis in SUmatra? (which is true, and Sumatra is a lot closer to Singapore than Shanghai is to Hong Kong)Edited: 7 years ago "
"Honestly, I don't think any of us are worked up. It's just the nature of the question. My first thought is ""what do you want me to say?"" If I tell you it's unsafe, will you not come? If I tell you it's safe, will you come then? You need to make a judgment yourself."
"A follow-up if you must need something technical to chew on: as H9N7 is believed to be carried by birds at this moment, a TV station interviewed a professor tonight regarding the risk. According to the scholar, at this time of the year, birds are migrating northwards so the risk of the disease traveling south from the flying birds is reduced.I don't know how one might reach to that analysis. It wouldn't change my judgment if I were a potential visitor. In fact, I would probably think it's funny that bird flight patterns are now being analyzed.Edited: 7 years ago "
"To put it into perspective, the distance between HKG and Shanghai/Anhui is rather irrelevant. After all, a decade ago one person brought an epidemic from HKG to Toronto 12,550km away on a 15 hour flight.If OP is worried, stay home. No one can guarantee if H9N7 will not be in HKG or anywhere else in the world in the future."
"Bob is correct, with International travel, no country is really immune to infectious disease anymore.At the end of the day, common sense is sometimes uncommon, and we have our own health beliefs and value system..Do we cease to live, cease to function or become crippled? I hope not. I was once in the same situation before, I was fine with the travel arrangement but because other travel partners were paranoid, so we had to cancel a trip.Hard decisions always...when other people are part of the equation....Edited: 7 years ago "
"It is particularly hard, especially when you are a new mother with a firstborn. Tuberculosis is a bad example tho, cure available & not highly pathogenic. distance not too relevant if transmittable by pp to pp. You check out any forum post on Ocean park - tonnes of complaints about china tourists. Alot of them in macau as well.I do not want to go but my husband wanted & insisted to. SighsEdited: 7 years ago "
"I think the two most relevant points from all these posts are as follows:--- There is absolutely no evidence of this disease in HK or Macau as of the present time. There is also no evidence as far as I know that H9N7 is transmitted from person-to-person. Yes, there are a lot of mainland tourists here (as there are also in S'pore, Thailand, etc.) and so if mainlanders scare you then by all means stay home.-- Be rational about risks. Statistically, the risk of a traffic accident (with a little one not secured in a car seat, because no taxi in HK has car seats and I bet you are not planning to travel with one, are you?) is significantly higher than the risk of coming down with an exotic disease."
"I am planning to go to Guangzhou on 7-9 June 2013, is it safe from H9N7 ?"
"This is the Hong Kong Forum. You may want to re-post your question at the Guangzhou forum.AFAIK they are still finding new cases of H7N9 and more alarmingly, newer H7N9 cases show ability to resist Tamiflu, according to news reports.You should also consult your local travel clinic or a doctor specialises in travel health and medicine for professional advice rather than relying on a public forum.Edited: 7 years ago "
"More off-topic, but I can't resist....... Have you read about the horrible Dengue Fever epidemic in Singapore?????"
