"According to Tahiti-infos the CDC has issued a statement against Americans traveling to FP as well as the greater South Pacific. This statement issued in part due to lack of medical infrastructure in Polynesia. The statement was issued yesterday, Aug 18"

Nothing misleading about it. This is a new advisory released by CDC. Read the article at Tahiti-infos.com.
So that's just basically a suggestion to be careful when there right?Airlines can still fly and people can still go?
"Let me rephrase my original comment. Given past posting history, IMO the OP was intentionally misleading. Virtually the entire world falls within that CDC Level 3 warning (and has for some time now).https:/…map-and-travel-notices.htmlAllie, you are correct."
"Thanks! I am due to fly out in about 17 days.I've been following the numbers, and I know the situation could change. But right now, I still want to go. Fingers crossed I get there."
"Allie, travel advisories may impact travel insurance coverages, not travel as such. I don't think CDC advisory has a legal force, because it's not the State Department, but I wouldn't dismiss all advisories. The advisory does not apply to all people but may apply to some who are discouraged from traveling to hot spots by their employers (just an example)."
More. Covid. Spam.
"Thanks IVK! My regular health insurance told me that they cover me for hospital / ER situations outside of the USA too. I was going to purchase travel insurance just to be safe. But if I do, I'll have to be careful to know what all they cover and what they don't.Edited: 4:52 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Allie It’s not the going at this point but the return part. If the numbers continue to climb the U.S. authorities could require a self.quarantine or some other measure. I am not saying it will happen, just could happen. Just another thing to consider."
I will take my chances. Can't wait to go to FP!!
In response to KAP 4 I have not posted misleading articles or statements. I have made predictions that were wrong. There is a difference.
"Pretty sure that most semi-regular readers understand the game.""It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is."""
Please stop promoting Tahiti-info. I’m not sure you are promoting this ad driven site in your posts and moderators are allowing it.
Not promoting anything. Just stating the source.
CDC has every country listed at level 3 except for its own where people can’t tend to follow simple instructions. We have to learn to live life with this virus just like we do with the flu and STD’s. I’m still going despite all the flight changes. Take the necessary precautions in public to protect yourself and everyone else. I plan on taking every OTC medication i May need and ensure i have the right travel vaccines and maybe even get a small rx incase of food poisoning.
Comparing this virus to the flu and STDs demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding regarding the nature of this new virus.
We flew back to the Bay Area (California) last Friday the 14th from French Polynesia and our 17 year old daughter is not allowed to go to her competitive dance studio for 2 weeks based on county requirements. So we are pretty much quarantining at home for two weeks too. I hope French Polynesia cases stop rising soon.
