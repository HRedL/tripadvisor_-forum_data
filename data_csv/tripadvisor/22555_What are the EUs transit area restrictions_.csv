"Let's say a US resident wants to travel to Belarus, making a layover in Frankfurt. The traveler is a permanents resident of USA and a citizen of Belarus. They arrive to the international transit area of Frankfurt airport, stay inside the transit area and then depart to Minsk. They will not leave the international transit area of Frankfurt airport.Are there any issues with that currently? Basically, does the EU ban on travel from USA apply to transit passengers staying within the transit area?"
Travelers from the US are not allowed.
"""Basically, does the EU ban on travel from USA apply to transit passengers staying within the transit area?""No, the EU recommendations specifically exclude ""passengers in transit"" from the restrictions."
"Oh, I see, ""passengers in transit"" is the standard nomenclature. Indeed thishttps:/…travel-and-eu-during-pandemic_ensays that the restrictions do not apply to ""passengers in transit"". Thank you."
"You can be ""in transit"" if both journeys are on the one ticket. If you have two separate tickets, the first airline will regard Frankfurt as your destination and you will probably be denied boarding."
"""Travelers from the US are not allowed"" is not a meaningful answer to the original question, since it does not clarify what exactly is not allowed. And this is what the original question is actually about.""Travelers from the US are not allowed to enter the EU""? True, but this is understood and this is beside the point of the question.""Travelers from the US are not allowed to transit through EU (touching down in a same-airport transit area)""? Apparently not true.Edited: 2:07 am, July 01, 2020 "
"What you need to be very careful about is the definition of ""passengers in transit"". Most airlines interpret it as passengers making a through ticketed connection, with both the arriving and onward flights on the same ticket. If you have two separate tickets, they may well refuse to allow you to board in the USA as the end point on the ticket you are using at that time is in a country you aren't allowed to enter. Through ticket, no problems."
"Yes, I'm talking about the situation when the entire trip is booked as a whole, even if it has 2 or 3 legs (e.g. at the originating US airport the luggage is checked-in to the final destination in Belarus).Edited: 2:10 am, July 01, 2020 "

"In this particular case I'm not the traveler.As for me... Personally, I traveled this route through Frankfurt airport more than a dozen of times already. Before this whole COVID situation that is.Edited: 3:32 am, July 01, 2020 "
Note that Frankfurt T2 is closed so connections there are a bit easier at the moment if a terminal change was required on this journey.
