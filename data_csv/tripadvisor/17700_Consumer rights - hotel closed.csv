"Hi everyone,we have booked a trip to Cancun starting this Saturday and we were now informed that the hotel is closed. Unfortunately, they only want to offer a credit for the next trip instead of a refund as they are insisting that we booked a ""non-refundable"" rate.What are my rights? I assume that they would need to give me the refund. Does anyone have a link that shows my rights?Thanks,ChristianPS: it is a big resort and not a small family hotel."
I would forfeit the voucher and claim on your travel insurance. That's what it's there for.
"Thanks for the answer. Our credit card has a travel insurance included, I am however not sure whether we are eligible for that as the hotel is closed. So instead of us cancelling the trip, it is rather the hotel..."
"Hi! I would for sure check with your insurance first, because I think each hotel has it's own policy as far as refunds go unfortunately. Did you pay for the whole hotel part of your trip, like the whole week?"
"Yes, we paid for the whole week."
"Oh I gotcha. IMO since they closed they should refund you themselves. I just checked our resort, we aren't going until end of May, and they don't do refunds eaither just no fee to change the reservation. Now we book flights and hotel package through our travel agent with cancel for any reason trip insurance though. I hope you can get your money back. I would try talking to a mgr at the hotel one more time. Than maybe plead with your CC company, and have them issue a charge back as a last resort."
"This happened to me, but they were not even going to reschedule. Call your credit card company dispute the charges. They will get the money back and refunded!"
"First off, did you book a non-refundable room? I would read through your booking VERY closely and make sure you are even eligible for a refund.If in fact you are, then I would do as others have said and contact your cc company."
Almost all travel insurance does NOT cover pandemics. Even if you have cancel for any reason. Check with your specific insurance to see what the fine print says.I am someone who reads fine print...and did very carefully last June when we booked our travel. I had ZERO reason to even consider pandemic as a non covered reason.Now I have learned...
"Fine print likely won’t cover you, it’s for THEIR protection. As such, it likely won’t say what your rights are if they close the doors on YOU. Send a firm email demanding money be refunded and get a read receipt. Make another call if you don’t receive an answer within 72 hrs. Document your call including who you spoke to, date and time. Also, how long you spent on hold. DISPUTE the charge with your cc which can usually be done online. You need to show them you tried to resolve directly with merchant. You will most likely get your money back. I wouldn’t stress."
"We are getting the run-around from our travel agent saying first that when the hotel closed, we would get a full refund, then she said 30 days and now, she's saying 90 days at best. I am disputing the charge with the cc company who said we have every right and then they fight the travel agent."
"Wow, what does cancel for ""ANY"" reason really mean, lol? I usually book vacations through funjet or directly with a cruise line & use their insurance. It's usually a little pricey, but we always buy it because of the cancel for any reason."
"Unfortunately, cancel for any reason is not valid if there is an epidemic. It's weird...but the fine print goes over all of that...which of course none of us would have even thought about until this happened. Now we know."
"Christian, you left out some pertinent information. Like ...- did you book directly with the hotel (that is, no 3rd parties)- if not, where do you live or maybe more importantly, where is the 3rd party domiciledIf you booked directly with the hotel, Mexican contract law likely has jurisdiction. I am no expert in that area but getting better than a credit for a future trip seems like a longshot to me."
"Yes, I booked directly. I contacted now my credit card company. Let's see what happens. I will keep this thread up to date."
