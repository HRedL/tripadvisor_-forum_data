"Even as 2 seasoned travelers at ages 69 and 81, we felt a heightened sense of vulnerability in light of the escalating # of virus cases in Italy. While Rome may be marginally affected right now, 3 legs of flights, time in airports, and fear of quarantine and an extended stay while we are in Rome finally persuaded us to cancel this trip. I respect everyone's decision that they base on their own evaluations. The final worry for us was being pariahs when we return to the US, which has already told us via alerts that we are to stay home. So, the losses for us--and our hearts are with the Italian people who are losing the most: UNITED AIRLINES--no flexibility because our flight is to Rome--not northern Italy (as things change, that might, too, but United reps have no answer when I ask why they are willing to send me to Italy when the Italian gov't has asked their own countrymen over 65 to stay home). HOTELS: Last July (Yes, we've been looking forward to this 40th anniversary trip a long time!), I booked 2 lovely hotels, non refundable--one released me from that contract and has not charged a cancellation fee--I might add that I had really enjoyed all my correspondence with them along the way--Nazionale 51. The other will keep our payment but has offered to let us rebook and use those dollars within a year--generous, I think, and we will rebook with them when we travel to Italy later. TOURS, private: No problem with refunds. Colosseum & Domus Aurea: I have prepaid tickets but I am assuming that they will not be refundable. I wonder if I ask if I might exchange them for a date on a future trip. TRAIN TICKETS: I booked RT tickets to Naples so we could have a day in Pompeii. Mmmm. Think that is $90 gone since I booked them as super savers--a lesson there? I wonder who would want to sit in a train with many other people in Italy today--just like airplanes, giant petri dishes. Anyway, we are disappointed that we aren't visiting Rome right now. Many of us are in the same situation so I thought I'd share what our experience is. United Airlines is most disappointing--I am getting quite the ping-pong ball treatment from them as they send me from the travel agency where i bought our airline tickets back to customer service. UA agents say they can't process anything on my tickets because they do not know what I paid--horse manure: my credit card statement shows that UA rec'd direct payment and the travel agency rec'd a miniscule amt of $$$. Since Rome is not a city they have identified as one they will give waivers for, there's not much for me to do except wait to see if that changes. I have already spent many hours on the phone. Lately I'm pouring wine first so it's getting a little more tolerable. Oh, and INSURANCE: We take out insurance with TinLeg for all international travel and we have been pleased with them (They paid w/0 question when my husband broke 3 ribs in Portugal several years ago.) I'm waiting to hear if they will give me a refund for my policy since I am only covered for medical while we are in Rome...and we won't be there. I expect to hear on Monday. Good luck to all of you who are weighing your options. We'll be in Rome sometime within the next year, God willing! Raise a glass to us on 29/3 when we'll be married 40 years. Best always to the Italians. Our hearts go out to all those suffering personal and financial difficulties because of the virus."
Question for OP SingingintheRain...Are you saying that United will not just charge a fee and let you rebook a ticket within the year using the remaining value of the ticket? Delta would have no problem with that and also often just waive that fee given the circumstances. Never have been a UA fan ...but that is really bad. Sorry you can't take the trip but your decision seems to be logical.
Delta is issuing waivers for those flying to Rome; UA is not. Yet. And all of you--thanks for not calling us ninnies for hanging out at home. So want Rome to be as worry free as our other trips always are.
Oh... the Italian dinner...I'm already practicing the wine part :) Thanks for your good thoughts.
I agree I think you made the right choice. I fear I will be making the same choice come May but I still have a little more time for things to change but I’m not optimistic. Happy anniversary!
"Fingers crossed that things will calm down by May. I wish you luck--maybe start looking for when you'd like to rebook? I read so much about this virus that I can't quote the source but one did say ""3-4 months to peak, 3-4 to subside."" I'm still worried about the trip we have booked to Spain in September. If all is clear in Italy, I think we'll keep our flights to Spain and then immediately take a flight to Rome for the holiday we're missing now. (When I talked to United, I asked that they just cancel the March Rome tickets and change my September flights to include a changed return date and a changed place from which we'd return--they would have saved $$ and we could have combined Spain and Rome. They said No. A basic economy ticket gives you no privilege and regardless of circumstances, they remain inflexible..) Wising you the best of luck!"
Have been forced to cancel our holiday to Rome next week so can empathise! Feel so heartbroken for the Italians and the devastating effects this crisis is having on their livelihoods.Hope you still manage to have wonderful anniversary celebrations!
"Happy anniversary and no you are not a ninnie, in fact Italy just announced a closing of all museums, sites, etc... I think you made the right decision. I have plans in mid May and am holding out hope.. if not look to re-booking in October another fabulous time in Italy..."
"So sorry you had to cancel your anniversary trip! I think it was definitely the right decision given how quickly things are changing right now. We were supposed to leave for a week in Rome yesterday and also canceled. I'm a nurse and would have had to self-quarantine for 2 weeks upon return so that was a deal-breaker. We had the same issues with British Airways, they would only waive change fees for flights to Northern Italy. We had a connection in London and asked if we could just forgo the Rome leg and were told that they would cancel the rest of the tickets if we did that. We called multiple times and they wouldn't do anything more than change the flights to the tune of $450 per ticket. American and Delta have much better policies and that's where I'm taking my money when we rebook! Fingers crossed that you will be able to reschedule later this year."
"So sorry! American Airlines is allowing changes to Rome. I wonder why United is being so stubborn?? We rebooked our April trip to November with American and it was easy and cost nothing to make the change. Fortunately, I had prebooked nothing except hotels and they allow cancellations since it was so far in advance. I too feel badly for the Italian people/country more than anything. It's an inconvenience for me - it's a major disruption and huge businesses losses for Italy."
"We too are cancelling our trip, yet it is based upon my boyfriend's company issuing restrictions. Lufthansa is being unsympathetic as well. I informed them that he cannot work from home and thus cannot afford the 2 week minimum quarantine, yet they refuse to accommodate me by providing me with a voucher for future travel or reimbursement. I must rebook by Friday, when our flight leaves, otherwise I lose the money for both tickets. So, I will wait to see if they cancel the flight (fingers crossed!), and if not, I will reschedule for June. I hope that this will have calmed down by mid June, as we cannot travel after that until December. Good luck to others who are in the same situation, and my heart goes out to all of those in Italy."
"British Airways, United, Lufthansa--I believe they are part of the same Sky Team. Maybe with the closure of all museums and attractions, those airlines will include Rome tickets in their free changes & rebookings. I suspect they won't do that and hope I'm wrong--they've had my $$ for the Rome trip for 8 months. Will do nothing for those of us flying to Rome in a crisis situation, yet anyone who books any flight anywhere on United in March will have free rebookings. for a year. Not much loyalty to existing customers. By a stroke of good fortune, maybe those of bearing the stone deafness of our airlines will meet each other in Rome in Sept and Oct."
"those airlines are part of ""Star Alliance""....Sky Team is Delta/KLM and Air France. I read where LH was cancelled like 50% of their flights so hopefully yours will be included...some airlines are really short sighted."
"You are doing the right thing. It’s hard to lose large sums of money. However, safeguarding your health is everything. EVERYTHING."
with things changing daily just wait till the last minute on the air cancel and hopefully things will change in your favor.

"My review about how United responds on a coronavirus crisis was not published by Tripadvisor because it it does not meet their review guidelines. I am republishing it here.When other airlines seriously cutting their flights UNITED is trying to make more people to book and don't care about us, who booked already. Few days ago they send email announcing to waive change fees for people who will book from March 3 to March 31st (trying to get more bookings of course). Yesterday they send the letter about ""how they respond to coronavirus"" saying that flight attendants will wear gloves when serving food and drinks, about HEPA filters on airplanes and AGAIN that for new bookings in March they will wave change fees, NOTHING about existing bookings. The worst airline ever. In this time we all share losses but United refuses to do so. What a shame.Edited: 9:14 pm, March 08, 2020 "
Were supposed to fly this coming Saturday but already canceled our trip . We booked thru Expedia bundle deals flight and hotel but good thing they refunded us.Airlines is American.
"I am on holiday in Rome until tomorrow, it is safe and keeping out in the fresh air, not mingling inside closed areas such as public transport and hotels makes life easier plus keeping my hands clean, not touching my face. There are many Americans on holiday here. Wearing masks are seen on Chinese and Japanese people. Like you, I am a health professional too, back to work later this week and I'm feeling well."
"I like that you emailed ABC. We can't get a refund so far on our JFK/Rome flight with Norwegian. They did tell us to call back in a few days, so maybe the agent knew more than she could say?I love Italy and hope this situation passes quickly."
We too have cancelled our trip to Rome though Airbnb have refunded the bulk of the monies. We have also been told the tours booked will be refunded. Holding off cancelling flights in the hope Easyjet may cancel and refund. I am beginning to wonder if a higher authority is trying to stop us getting to Rome. Booked 2 years ago for husband’s 65 birthday and got Australian Flu the day before so had to cancel so rebooked this year for his 67 birthday and had to cancel again. Hopefully we will make it sometime soon.
"Threedawg, Delta has been telling me that since Italy was given a level III. I assume they're stalling as long as possible to convince ticket holders to change flights, rather than give refunds.Delta has suspended ATL & DTW flights to FCO, but continue JFK/FCO flights"
"I would love to change my flights to sometime in the fall, but they still want to charge $150 per flight, $300 total, to do so. Ridiculous. They encouraged me to call back and kept saying I could do this up until thirty minutes before the flight leaves. Hopeful and waiting..."
"This entire situation is absolutely ridiculous! I just received notification from Lufthansa that our flight on Friday is still scheduled. I received the same information as ThreeDawgDouble, in that I have until one hour prior to boarding to make a decision. This would have proven valuable last week when the nation had yet to essentially shut itself down and we still planned to travel. Now,I do not understand why they will not release us from a reservation that we intended to hold and use, yet extraneous variables are forcing us to do otherwise. I would love to reschedule for June, but will we be allowed to travel to Rome at that time? This is extremely frustrating and truly unfair, as I travel quite often and spend too much money on airfare to be treated in such a manner. At least the American airlines have made changes that seem reasonable and fair. And please note, I understand that my frustration and loss is nothing compared to that of those in Italy currently. If I could fly there and spend time and money in that exquisite city, I most certainly would.... and I shall once we are cleared to do so! My heart and hopes are with the people of Italy and all others who are suffering from this.Edited: 10:58 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I don't think there are any really happy endings to any of these stories, especially for the people of Italy--BUT I do have some good news to report that might be of help to some ofyou--I received a credit for my flight after my 3rd call to United at 4:30 this morning --and even then the wait time was 40 minutes. I was told that they were not crediting trips to Rome and I asked how that was possible when the country was on lockdown and people were not coming and going to Italy. I added, thanks to a reminder from a TA member, that since my ticket started with 016, I could cancel my flight booked for March and reschedule. After that, agent said that i had to call the travel agency that booked the ticket so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor granted the credit but I was so weary from having to explain, re-explain, and virtually beg for help that I forgot ask the $$$ amt of the credit. I will need to rebook by phone and the credit is only good for one year from the initial date of purchase. So...we have to travel by July 23 (Yes, i booked really far in advance but it was to be that special anniversary trip.) Summer trips are more expensive so need to add $$ and if the virus is still rearing its ugly head and we don't travel, then we lose the whole ticket. Taking a chance that Italy will be welcoming tourists by then and happy to spend our money there. I want to add that in between calls to United that were purely frustrating, I wrote and documented that the original charges for my ticket were paid to United because they told me they didn't know what I paid for the ticket so they couldn't give me a credit. In the long run, I think that having this on my United Miles charge card made the most difference--but not until the 3rd call and a supervisor's input. Best of luck to all....and I hope I really do have a credit. If nothing else, I've enjoyed ""meeting"" all of you and I hope to hear how all your plans are shaping up. I am wondering especially, lindam, if those of you on holiday are planning to/allowed to leave Italy. Best regards to all."
Wow I called United and they said the same BS and gave me a FAKE number to call if I want to request a refund. Thank god I for cancel for any reason insurance or I would be out for all my money!
Did anybody else here buy travel insurance?
Same problem with Alitalia. No refund but will let me re-book but have to fly by June 1 which isn’t possible for us
We have insurance but the excess would wipe out the air fares as everything else has been refunded
"Norwegian this morning on their website:Information on upcoming cancellationsDue to the COVID-19 situation, Norwegian is preparing to cancel approximately 3000 flights between mid-March and mid-June."
"@ ThreeDawgDouble:We already tried to contact Norwegian about that and if the flight is still not ""officially"" canceled in their system (even though we cannot enter Italy), they are still not letting you do anything. In fact, when I checked yesterday, I could still book the very expensive tickets to my flight that cannot even happen. I think they are hoping for a miracle and that they will turn around and lift the ban. :-OP: Two of our hotels also gave us a credit for our non-refundable stay. They got back to us right away and have high marks in our books for customer service.Edited: 9:03 am, March 11, 2020 "

"If they cancel, I'm OK with that. What gets me is that because our flight is just a few days after their cutoff 3/19 and ours is 3/25 They won't even waive the rebooking fees for the fall. Waiting, waiting waiting, and wishing Italy all the love."
"Lufthansa still has not cancelled our flight to Rome for this Friday. and they will not give a refund nor a voucher. They do not care that sites, hotels, restaurants, etc. are closed: it's not their problem It looks like I will be forced to rebook for a higher priced flight in the future-- I am at the mercy of that corporation. Hopefully we will be able to travel at the end of June and will not have to deal with this again. Frustrating and angering! This will be the last time that I travel with that airline !"
"Where have you read that hotels and restaurants are closed?I am surprised they are not refunding or offering to change your flight given, my understanding is, that no new foreign travelers are allowed to enter Italy at the moment (unless one has a reason to do that fits their criteria of need (business, family)"
Always make sure you get cancel for any reason insurance. Never again will I expect the airlines are compassione and understanding. Protect yourselves from their coldheartedness in the face of these dark times.
"Happy Anniversary! This situation is so sad... I feel for us all.We are a family of 13 with a family trip in June. We have rented a villa in Tuscany and at this moment in time just ""hanging"" in there. I know that time will tell. Hoping that people do improve or a medical discovery will help all those who are sick.Good luck and health to all."
"I am hoping, queen traveler, that you get to have your trip--it sounds like a fabulous event. With today's tally of new cases in Italy (2000+) I wonder when the ebbing of new cases will occur. June sounds like it's far enough away that you will be there for the reopening of Italy at a beautiful time. Flowers, wine, great historic sights, everyone glad to be alive. Savor the thought."
"I finally had luck today in rebooking our flights to Rome. I'd rather not travel in July because I hate the heat, but I hate financial loss even more. I will learn to bare my fat old arms for the sake of comfort. It was no easy task to get rebooked....3 phone calls, several letters to every executive at United, and at least 4-5 hours on hold listening to elevator music. I used the United sight to find fares that were close to what I originally paid for our March flights. Called United, insisted that even though I had booked with a travel agency, my bank statement said United got my $$$. I gave numbers, dates. What still frosts me is that the $200+ I paid for seats (one layover for a connecting flight) is not refundable. I don't know if it was persistance or a really nice fellow at United but on the new flights (non-stop) I got free seats and there was no charge for the more expensive flights. I might add that right after I finished booking, they denied my refund request for a domestic flight to get us to EWR. Just such a messy situation for all, most of all Italy--2000+ cases yesterday? Fear must prevail for those who are elderly or infirm. Lessons learned: Cancel for any reason insurance, direct flights, no non-refundable reservations. I have read that heat will kill the virus--does anyone have a credible resource that agrees with that viewpoint? Off now to hear Pres. Trump address the coronavirus issue. Blessings to all."
Let's all hope for heat!!!United is impossible. I will not even consider flying with them. American is not much better. I had rather pay a little more and go with Delta. I find that they can be somewhat reasonable!!!!!!!
"The evidence that warm weather will kill the coronavirus is still inconclusive.""Will Warm Weather Kill Coronavirus?U.S. President Donald Trump said he hoped the virus would go away in April 2020 because the ""heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus.""What's TrueSome viral strains, such as those that cause common cold and influenza, are less likely to spread during warmer seasons.What's FalseAlthough warm weather may slow the spread of some viruses, it doesn't eradicate the seasonal diseases they cause.What's UndeterminedIt's too early to tell if the spread of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will be dampened by warm weather.""https:/…"

"Lufthansa finally canceled our flight to Rome (I am so very sad not just for my trip, but for everyone in Italy! Truly, my heart goes out to all of you, and I promise that we will visit and spend money as soon as we are allowed to travel again!). I am uncertain as to what the next steps are to secure a refund. I have been calling them for the past few hours, but they answer with a recording and then hang up (this has occurred 8 times in the last three hours). I attempted to submit an e-mail through their website, but it is frozen. I did send a feedback message on another page, but I am not sure if that will garner a response. I will continue to call throughout today and tomorrow, but I fear that this will continue as such and I will not be refunded. Does anyone have any further information from personal experience regarding ticket refunds due to an airline cancelling flights? Thank you."
@ProfessorOnzaga I am relieved for you that they cancelled the flight. I messaged you personally regarding the travel ban from Europe to US. The ban is for 30 days from Friday and my trip happens to start in exactly 30 days from Friday. Not sure if I will get a cancellation though. Crossing my fingers for a cancellation from Lufthansa.
"""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/italy-shops-… Resteraunts, bars, everything closed in Italy by order of the president.""Wow! That is killing all the economics around the world as well."
"We did but coronavirus is excluded. Our trip is early May. Hoping the situation improves dramatically , but if not we’ll cancel and take the financial hit. Not worth our health - were high risk"
"United still flying to Italy. I can change til end of April but can’t get refund on any hotels, tours, car rental . This is for early May trip. I can’t understand why airlines are still flying there, further taxing the terrible health crisis they are trying to manage. My heart breaks for Italy, but also for US where we have no idea of how many ill due to no test kits."
"We are scheduled to fly to Rome on May 31 from Miami on Alitalia. Nothing cancelled yet. Will wait to see what the airline will do. Regardless, we will not be going to Italy a place we love and been to several times. I do hope Alitalia will be sensitive to people's concerns and at least offer a voucher for a future flight. We certainly wish all Italians the best with their health and their economy."
"I know Lufthansa must be swamped but their Current Flight Information page is confusing and seems incomplete. From what I gather my flights to/from are either changed or canceled, but I have not heard anything from Lufthansa directly. And while they have information on rebooking (with fairly restrictive rules), there is not information on refunds for Europe flights. They are making a bad situation even more uncertain and stressful. https:/…flight-information"
You made the right decision - but I am so sorry about your anniversary plans. Thank you so much for the valuable details. Our hearts go out to all of Italy (and Europe) in this health and economic disaster.
