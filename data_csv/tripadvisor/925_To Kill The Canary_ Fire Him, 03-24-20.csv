"While it *seems* to be political, this topic is FAR more than that.People watching things here in Hawaii prob know that the Lt. Gov. Josh Green (a medical doctor) has been very open and a known source and voice for COIVID-19 info. In fact, he was appointed to the Muppet guv's ""task force' when it was started.Many times, the best info and most helpful info has come from him, or been pushed ahead from him (like distancing and quarantines).Well.....he sang too loudly. He's been fired:https:/…https:/…We will now have far less transparency and reliable info and credible directions from the State. This is dangerous to all of us--and visitors too. I cannot even describe how this bothers and frightens me.........and I am not easily frightened.SWEdited: 1:21 am, March 25, 2020 "
"Well.....he sang too loudly. He's been fired:” And, I fear that’s going to happen to Dr. Fauci! Very scary times indeed!"
"Yep.....and now they are also ""re-evaluating"" the determination of the CV-19 death on Oahu. As in they suddenly say maybe it wasn't COVID-19 after all.https:/…"
"So darn frustrating! He seemed to be the only voice of reason and sanity in the whole Ige administration.We are fortunate to have Kawakami as our Mayor, and that Ige can't get rid of him for looking too competent as well. Although I am a little concerned about the 50 person limit at Costco and the unsafe lines it may create."
