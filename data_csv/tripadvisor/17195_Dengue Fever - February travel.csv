"Hi, my husband and I are considering a 2 week trip around Sri Lanka in February. I am slightly concerned about the recent outbreak of Dengue. I am keen to find out more about the risk before we book our flights. I have searched the forum but can't find many posts about it - can anyone direct me to the posts or reply with some more information? Any info would be greatly appreciated. ThanksClare"

"Thank you. I can't help but be put off by the risk, but I am so disappointed as I was really looking forward to visiting Sri Lanka. I am concerned that even if we decide to go, the constant worry about being bit might ruin the trip! Is the risk likely to be much lower in February?"
"Well the epidemy has been declared over now. Hence risk is now same as it was last April, if based on your research then you booked no reason to cancel ;-)E+S"
So it's over now? We arrive in September
"Well last April, same as last 5 years, was not an epidemic level. But still considerable, hence do make the usual precautions (Deet etc.)!<Erik> & [Sandya]"
Thanks. All of the information that I can find online is from July when (I think) it was at it's peak. Do you know if there are any newer sources available?
