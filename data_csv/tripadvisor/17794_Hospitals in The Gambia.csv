Hi allJust wondering if anyone had had any experiences with the hospitals in TG while holidaying?Cheers!
luckily no
"I was taken to Hospital, can't remeber where, I was totally gone I could hardly move and Aching, still don't know what it was, not Malaria.Think it might have been Westfield area.Friends had to bring in food and drink for me. Rich......"
Walked past the back of the ones in Banjul many many times. Always loads of people sat around outside. One thing I don't like to see is all the coffins just stacked up and laid in the street outside the mortuary. This street is a main throughfare from Atlantic into town. All these coffins have Banjul city council painted on them. Anybody who has stayed at Atlantic will know what I'm talking about.
"Have unfortunately visited many times in Victoria Teaching Hospital, Banjul. Nothing like hospitals here. Have also attended and visited Bilijo Medical Centre, Afrimed and Wellingara Clinic. Actually taught the staff first aid at Wellingara and keep in touch with them giving them supplies and volunteers with us have spent time there helping. Hygiene is a huge issue in all the establishments. Was there anything particular you wanted to ask about? maybe i could shed some light.... or maybe not!"
Gingerbells my daughter is a trainee nurse. She starts her last year in September. She is studying at Leeds and does her placements at the LGI. Read on one of your posts you would like friends in Banjul. I've many friends in Banjul both male and female including one man who has worked at the victoria for a lot of years. This man is a well respected family man and takes no nonsense. Pm me if you would like a bit of help to get you settled and show you the ropes round Banjul. I will be in Banjul around chrismas day god willing. Hope things work out for you.

"Enjoyed your post, Bob."
"HiBob Snap Must have been the Westfield I spent 3 days there in 2004 again on a drip due to gastro-enteritis They put me in a side room (for toubabs) and couldnt understand why my boss-lady wouldnt stayThe floors were alive with all sorts of crawlies. What especially amused me were the ""fly-boys"" although some were girls There were about a dozen in all who worked on a shift basis 24 hrs a day and whose sole job was to walk around clapping their hands together and killing flying insects between them I supplied all the needles and giving sets from my own medical kit as they were putting used ones in a type of Milton fluid and reusing them rgds"
"Adrian, is that where you got all your Medical Care Idea's..?? :-) Rich.................."
"I always take overseas medical kits with me - just in case - I was involved with someone who i knew, and the hospital knew, had HIV and the nurses still did not use gloves, wash their hands or use hand sanitiser to change drips etc. Her family were responsible for cleaning her and again no precautions taken. The lady died due to 'taboo' about having HIV and refusing the american charity help i had arranged through bijilo medical centre, her sister who nursed her now also has HIV but thankfully has taken the help offered and receives her drugs. ( she has not told her family for fear of being outcast, taboo is huge around HIV, a lot of ignorance, even though there are some huge campaigns on to educate) I wish you every success in your work, i know some days will break your heart, but i also know you will be making a huge difference just by being there and helping these really good people. Good luck."
"I had my gall bladder removed in The Victoria in Banjul and lived to tell the story. Have also been admitted with malaria and under went rabies treatment at the MRC. You can get most things treated these days, things have improved over the last few years, some folk pick up very nasty things in U.K. hospitals these days!!!"
"Thanks for all your messages guys! very insightful and very supportive. Nice adventure there Bob...what a story teller!North, ill be Pm'ing you later on for that guys details...Westcoastlass....will defiantly be picking your brains too.really glad i found this little community on line. xx"
looking forward to hearing more form you Gingerbells
"hazeldolphin, I am so glad that you recovered from your gall bladder op and have a positive view of the medical progress in TG. Perhaps it is due to the fact that they now have their own University medical training school. Looking forward to hearing lots more about medical progress in TG. Hey maybe no Malaria 'Inshalla'"
"Mumbasi,There is a new Malaria thing in the offing, they Inject Mozzies with DNA some sort of thing that doesen't allow them to Mate..As Usual, can't remember who were doing it but they are sending these Mozzies to different places in Mozzie Territory, to stop production.. Rich........"
ric it was news on BBC online (health) but now there are reports saying in some parts of Africa that malaria-carrying mozzies are disappearing.....but they will come back stronger & maybe cause an epidemic? we wait.www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-13128327www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14685612
Just an Update of Hospitals.. :-northantset.co.uk/news/features/from_one_ext… Rich......
"Thanks blue very interesting articles. Ric yours brought tears to my eyes, poor Gambia. So glad they find lots to smile about thank goodness."
"Despite hospitals, traditional medicine health care is still widely practised in Gambia.Edited: 9 years ago "
...according to an article in The Point newspaper yesterday :-thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/gambia-to-…Edited: 9 years ago 
The Point newspaper itself thinks traditional medicine is essential to health delivery :-thepoint.gm/africa/…traditional-medicine-is -essential-to-health-deliveryIs not traditional medicine and its active promotion by the Gambian government bad for the development of hospitals and more effective healthcare?Is traditional medicine an excuse for not investing more in hospitals?JohnEdited: 9 years ago 
The article at post 21 should download here :thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/traditiona…
hi ricany idea where banang hosp is ? that was a very interesting story in the telegraph - thanks for that
mamacoolIts Bansang Bansang is a town of about 10000 on the south bank in the central-east area of the Gambia Take a look at www.bansanghospitalappeal.com lots of info there and kept up to date rgdsEdited: 8 years ago 
mamacoolMeant to say its past Georgetown about 200/220 miles from Banjul rgds
wow thats a fair distance away !We are building one on North Bank at Bakindic thanks for that info....
"First Aid 4 Gambia will be visiting Bansang this year, volunteers will be in that region for 1 week, part of our trip is training for some of the staff at Bansang Hospital. We don't visit until April, but will let you know how it goes etc."
We often visit the hospital at Gunjur (not sure if I've spelt that correctly). Luckily not as patients but to help with supplies etc. It's improved greatly over the past 10 years.
just bumping this in case anyone has heard anything from gingerbells . REally interested to hear how she is getting on x
"Had dinner with her when i was there a couple of weeks ago, she was doing ok but totally horrified by what she had found. I look forward to catching up with her when i return in January."
i am hoping to meet up with her in march if shes still there. REally interestd to hear all about her experiences. Hoping she may get some interenet access and post for us all................................Thanks for the update westcoastlass
"You asked for hospital experiences in Gambia so here is a positive one. One afternoon I got a call to say my friend had been admitted to Lamtoro hospital in Kololi. I found her to be delirious and very ill. She had the worst kind of malaria and also dysentery (she had been staying in a village, helping in their school, and drinking their ginger beer - not thinking that this would be made from the well water that she was otherwise avoiding!). She had travel insurance and I was able to find her papers so the hospital was able to carry out her treatment without any further ado. The hospital was very clean and she had a private room with a nice view over a garden. I was very impressed when she was discharged after 4 days, pretty well recovered, albeit a bit weak. This was a few years ago but last year when a friend cut his foot badly they were able to stitch it up very quickly and the wound healed well. I still found the place to be very clean and the staff efficient.Lamtoro is a private hospital and it is expensive, but if I was seriously ill I would definitely go there if it was at all possible."
Just back from TG. Ginger had malaria last week and got her treatment at Bijilo clinic rather than the RV in Banjul where she was working.I think she has found the standards at RV leave a lot to be desired after her experiences working in the intensive care unit.
good to hear a good experience devongirl gambia. I do hope that gingerbells is ok now . She will have some fabulous tales to tell on her return by the sound of it!Edited: 8 years ago 
just bumping for ginger in case she gets on.........................Anyone seen or heard from her??
"hi sunset...i dont get on much but here i amI was working at the ITU at RV. not there anymore, i got quite sick and had a 'complication'. am returning home in a few weeks, i will PM you everything. i loved working there...the people were very welcoming. it WAS pretty bad tho."
aw shame we will miss you by the sounds of it. Have been wondering how you were getting on. Cant wait to hear all about it! Thanks xx
