"During Phase 3 due to Covid-19 in Mexico, the suspension of non-essential activities in the entire public and private sector remains in force and must be enforced, in case of contempt, there will be sanctions. The healthy distance is also increased more than 50 percent, that is, going from 1.50 meters to 2.25 meters, according to the general guidelines. While all non essential work is cancelled, AMLO has repeated that the call to stay at home is voluntary. Guidelines remain only leave home to buy groceries, medicine, or care for loved ones. This phase 3 is not severely more restrictive (there are more sanitation protocols, and there will be closures of anyplace that has a surge of infections), but signals that there is concern for the hospital system's capacity being overwhelmed IF people do not respect social distancing guidelines. Adela Román Ocampo was out yesterday repeating calls to respect social distancing, and said that the number of cases in Acapulco have doubled. Acapulco at 62 has about half of Guerrero's total of 129 confirmed cases."
"Online classes began on Monday.I think the gov. of GRO indicated that notaries could return to work, as an essential business. I think some have been working the entire time."
"62 cases in a city that size, and they are on complete lockdown? They should shut down earlier. Don't know how the hospitals will handle it."
"ok, but what's up with the ""no open toed shoes"" thing? (the first #6)Edited: 10:24 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"LaCallie, I guess it is in line with other measures - gloves, masks, long sleeves, and pants. Leave as little skin exposed as possible, and ties in with #1. when arriving home - clean shoes including soles with. bleach solution. Corey, not sure if you are being genuine, or sarcastic. But to answer your comment on face value:The secretary general of SNTSA estimates that there are 50-60 ventilators capable of treating Covid patients in the entire state. There are about 10 in Acapulco - 6 in the main hospital, and a few others in hospitals accepting Covid patients. The hospitals are at this point fairly limited in what they can handle, so the voluntary quarantine is still very much needed. Cases have risen to 75 in Acapulco. In the entire state they have done 640 tests, and the number of confirmed positives has jumped nearly 200% in the past two weeks. Current state figures are 163 confirmed, 53 suspicious, and 25 dead. In other news, the municipal government has opened up around 10-12 food stations around the city to try and help those without incomes."
Thank you for this update!
Well. On that news. Safe to say the virus isn't going anywhere from now until February with no vaccine before then. See you all in 2022.
Gee Corey Thanks for the optimistic out look I Plan on Being There in 2021 for sure

"I'm with you, Hank. Remaining cautiously optimistic for January. We'll all NEED this next get-away for sure! I'd be willing to bet that Charlie 'n Jane 'n Sandy 'n Andy 'n Cathy 'n Liz and a whole bunch of others have tentative plans to be back in town too. Maybe Dave (time to retire amigo!)? But I know we're all smart enough to wait & see how this plays out over the next several months. We got time.Great article, Rob. I'll be watching for those 'time to book' signals."
I have already started watching January/February 2021 fares. High right now but I have plenty of time.
Heading there late Oct. Till t giving. Back after that. Jan Mar
Face masks now obligatory in many parts of town.

"Beginning tomorrow, April 30, 2020 - Acapulco now will have a ""don't drive today"" program similar to that in Mexico City. The day you can't drive will be indicated by the last number of your license plate. Everyone can drive on the weekends, which makes absolutely no sense if the mission is to stop the flowing of too many people.....but, hey, what do I know?https:/…Edited: 10:09 am, April 29, 2020 "
"Hank an ronval, I wish I could share your enthusiasm. I'm guessing I'll immune by then. Heck, if I could get the virus tomorrow, I would. I just think the world will be still frothed up at that time with a third surge after the second shutdown, and airlines near bankruptcy. Flights will end up being few and far between. If we can manage a third of the population in the USA being through it and immune by December, we'll be on a better road. I just hope Acapulco isn't in economic turmoil by next February. 2022 amigos."
"For herd immunity we need 60% of the population to show antibodies. At this point we do not have sufficient testing, no reliable treatment and no vaccine. Stay locked down at least until we have one out of three and we will get through this. My plans have been delayed. I have an articling student scheduled to start June 1, but he can't even start until he has passed the bar exam and that's not scheduled or even re-scheduled yet. When I wrote it there were 500 of us in a convention centre. Only illness was the puke fest we heard in the ladies washroom during the business law exam. They chose feminist jurisprudence rather than international business law. Go figure. Once I have a certified lawyer to take my place I'm spending three months in Acapulco, starting at Las Brisas and then hopefully some long term BnB overlooking La Quebrada and PDLC. Stay safe."

In regards to herd immunity i am hearing alot of contractions on this. All the assumptions initially have not turned out to be true. Unchartered waters I am telling you. Lost a buddy at work 50 and no pre existing anything. Keep safe folks. I am unconfident of 2021 :(
United has lowered some of their fares from a coupla weeks back. Looking at Jan March timeline
"The governor said yesterday in his conference that the beaches will remain closed until at least the 31st of May, and has asked people to refrain from Mother's Day celebrations. Current reported cases in the whole state has risen to 308, with 50 deaths."

"Truck, sorry to hear about troubles in NYC, and the people you know. Herd immunity is not a strategy. It's incidental. It's a result of a lot of pain and suffering. No suggestions of crowding in a high school gym to acquire it. As months go by, the immunity quotient will rise even as we move carefully about the world."
"I'm not happy to think it, but we're seeing things differently as of late ... and might be erring on the side of caution with Corey and Truck. The next few months will reveal what lies ahead; but I sure do miss Acapulco.Charlie ... so sorry to hear about your buddy. I went through that last month (as I already mentioned), and it still lingers on my mind.The only thing that'll give some reassurance and confidence to the traveling masses is a vaccine ... hopefully sooner than later.I'm trying to remain optimistic, if only to keep our spirits alive."
"SnorkNo kidding Herd Immunity with out a proven therapeutic cure, or vaccine is the only answer and it it very close if not already getting there. As per the CDC more than a Million Americans already have it and have not symptoms or have fully recovered, in addition the CDC says close to 200,000 new cases a week will probably be registered. So do the Math, with those kind of numbers, it;s no consolation to those who have died and that is sad, however the real mortality rate is probably around 0.4%. Far more destruction and devastation will be cause in all countries by the prolonged shutdown than and virus IMO . I plant to be at the Princess as always by mid January, Hope all is well and have a great day."
"I have to go with lock down because I have one dear clerk who has had my back for over 20 years despite crippling arthritis that has deformed her hands. The meds she is on weaken her immune system. She is working 12 hour days to keep the real estate practice afloat. If she was to go down half the city would be in mourning, she is that loved. Even without the other practice areas we are paying our bills and I have not had to dip into my three month reserves. We are considered an essential service. I was actually surprised that I was considered essential. Hell, I was surprised when the law society deemed me to be of good character. So close to being able to pass on my practice, I can smell the ocean air. Now it will be another year or so. Viva Acapulco"
"Por coronavirus, Interjet volará solo a 6 destinos nacionales: ProfecoLos destinos donde aún se mantienen operaciones son: Ciudad de México hacia Cancún, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Oaxaca, Puerto Vallarta y Mérida."
And it appears that United Airlines might file for bankruptcy protection. They've announced massive layoffs for the Chicago area.
What year?
"Since they have accepted the government benefits, I think the penalty would be brutal They have also made deals with the unions. Any of these will require notice before layoffs. United, American ,Delta and others may suffer But the Guv will keep them open."
Bankruptcy protection. Look it up. There are going to be many. Starting to pile up already. Many of them tilting on the edge before this mess. Despite this great economy.
"We are getting waaaay off topic here. So of course I will contributeFor the record, they are not seeking bankruptcy at the moment - in fact they just went into the market today with a $2.5 billion dollar bond deal. They have also backed down on the conversion of workers from full to part time status. They are exploring voluntary furloughs, and guaranteeing status for those who accept.The US airline that everyone (in the financial world) is concerned about is AA. They were in the weakest position financially before the crisis. I am guessing they will fall before UAL. Let's try to keep this Acapulco-centric.

"Yesterday they closed 400 businesses in the Central Market deemed ""non-essential"". They also closed another small market in Hogar Moderno which apparently had seen a ""bloom"" of infections."
Looks like they busted a bunch of restaurants and hotels in Pie de la cuesta for having guests and disobeying the temporary closures....including Tres Marias and Hotel Vayma....
"A bit of a bright spot just came out on the news wires - AMLO is going to be presenting Mexico's ""economic reopening plan"" next week. Parts of this should directly address tourism, hotels and airlines, I hope.And breweries, obviously.Edited: 9:04 am, May 07, 2020 "
"Wow, Rob, PDLC is already isolated, but a ban is necessary. My amigo, Fernando, next to Tres Marias, lagoon side, was doing really well with AirBnB and their ""hotelito"". All stopped. AirBnB gave refunds to guests but the property owners get nothing. Going to be a long, hot summer."
"I think the suffering will continue for the summer, but it won't be total. I am hearing rumors (I can't give it any more validity than that at the moment) that the beaches will reopen at the same time as Schools, June 1st. AMLO is going to detail a economic reopening plan, which should cover tourism. And I imagine that as soon as there is a green light, tourists are going to arrive in droves to celebrate the ""end"" of Quarantine. Hopefully your friend (and many other hoteliers) can take advantage of that safely.I personally prefer to err on the side of caution, and science. But I have the luxury of still being employed. I think that the situation in Acapulco is dire economically, and their ability to maintain this closure can be counted in weeks at best."
"Took a drive down to Pie de la Cuesta last weekend just to get out of the house- all those places were open. I agree RF- as soon as its green lit its gonna get crazy. I am self employed w/ about 12 employees, had to lay off a few but am bringing some back since we just got the PPP loan funded this morning. But I have heard from friends in LA and SF that a lot of businesses- including some bars, have been open discreetly. We definitely should be grateful- if I was not employed and there was no gov aid, and especially if I had a family to feed, living even somewhat paycheck to paycheck - I'd open up also. What other choice do you have?"

"(Washington Post) -- MEXICO CITY — Mexico's government says it will lift a quarantine for hundreds of counties starting May 18 and will begin to gradually reopen the rest of the nation on June 1 as it seeks to emerge from the coronavirus epidemic.The country has been on a nationwide lockdown for more than seven weeks, and businesses are eager to reopen. Analysts are predicting that the economy could shrink up to 10 percent this year — one of the most significant recessions in Latin America.""We've begun a new stage. There's a light at the end of the tunnel,"" President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said at a news conference on Wednesday.Under the plan, the government would allow 269 municipalities scattered over 15 states to resume most activities on Monday. These are places that have had no confirmed coronavirus cases and whose neighboring counties also have no sign of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. They represent just over 10 percent of all municipalities in Mexico.The rest of the country will be assigned a color starting June 1 that indicates the extent to which businesses, schools and public gathering places can reopen. In addition, three major industries will be included on the list of ""essential"" sectors that can resume operations nationwide — construction, mining and auto manufacturing.Mexico has had significant outbreaks in five cities, including Mexico City, the epicenter. As of Tuesday, the government had logged nearly 4,000 confirmed deaths from covid-19. Authorities have said that the actual number is certainly higher.The lockdown in Mexico has been less severe than in many other Latin American countries, relying on persuasion rather than police or soldiers to keep people home. Schools and most businesses and government offices have had to close, however. Authorities say the restrictions have prevented a nationwide spike in cases, although the virus continues to spread through the country.Officials indicated that Mexico City will remain ""red"" — the highest level of lockdown. Three big states on the U.S. border, in contrast, are considered ""green"" — Chihuahua, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon. If they remain in that category, they will be able to resume manufacturing and other business activities in June, and schools in those states will reopen. New safety measures will be in place to discourage transmission of the virus.The Trump administration has been urging Mexico to restart assembly plants that provide inputs for critical U.S. industries such as defense contractors. Mexico has been wary since dozens of workers have become sick at border factories that remained open. Several have died.Baja California is considered ""red"" because of a coronavirus outbreak in the city of Tijuana, south of San Diego.The two other border states — Sonora and Tamaulipas — are ""yellow,"" meaning that businesses can reopen but schools will remain closed and restrictions on gathering places, including churches and parks, will continue.Many of Mexico's popular beach destinations — Acapulco, Cancun, Playa del Carmen — are in ""red"" states, meaning hotels and restaurants will probably not reopen for weeks. Tourism accounts for about 8 percent of the economy.Officials cautioned that shutdowns could be reintroduced in states or municipalities if cases flare up again. They believe that Mexico City and Cancun recently passed their peaks of new cases and that the epidemic will ebb in those cities in the coming weeks.But Hugo López-Gatell, the Health Ministry official who has designed Mexico's strategy, acknowledged that much was still unknown about the path of the virus.""In every moment, there is uncertainty,"" he said. ""Every country in the world faces the question of whether you can head into the new normality, and at what speed."""
I heard of this last week! Wasn't sure!I guess what I heard was correct!
"Gawd, they're listening to the politicians, again. There is no widely available testing and tracing capability, there is no effective therapy and there is no vaccine...... and the U.S. is encouraging them to open manufacturing facilities so that they can keep their own factories running. Go with the science or go with the wave....the next wave."
"Washington Post. God help us. Novedades paper this morning said Guerrero was entering its worst phase. Acapulco is still in the red area. Many of Mexico's popular beach destinations — Acapulco, Cancun, Playa del Carmen — are in ""red"" states, meaning hotels and restaurants will probably not reopen for weeks. Tourism accounts for about 8 percent of the economy.We must assume that anyone who posts to the Acapulco forum is speaking of Acapulco related news - not rumors. The roosters did win last weekend though.Edited: 2:43 pm, May 13, 2020 "
How many counties are in Guerrero? They mention counties several time in the W Post article. I was not aware Mexico had counties. Just wondering about total credibility of the article. If they are wrong I think it should just be disregarded

"That would be the equivalent of municipalities Lago. However, right along with Mexico News Daily the Wapo is right up there with my list of non-reads. (no offense RFNJ) NYTimes is there too.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero"
I'm in Tulum in Guerrerro and I saw that shock headline about COVID on the counter on the OXXO store.That newspaper looks more like a tabloid and I try to avoid it.
Tulum in Guerrero? Where is that?
"No offense taken, AcaRes. I think that in regards to people's like and dislikes of newspapers, this was not an opinion or commentary piece. I get the dislike of the Washington Post, and the NYT - my father used to joke that reading the NYT turned his hands ""red"" (communist). But there is not a lot of English language coverage out there, and I don't see much factually wrong with the article. I appreciate any links to the contrary. Lago, Guerrero has 81 counties, called municipios. So I think from that aspect at least you are fine in regards to credibility concerns. The article was reaffirming what we heard a few weeks ago on the federal plan, originally regarding schools - that there will be two stages of openings - this coming Monday for places that have no infections, and a second in two weeks in places that have them - though everything is subject to revision based on case data (of which there has been a lot of published suspicion given low levels of testing, and disagreements about estimated cases). Astudillo has said recently he is NOT SURE that they will in fact reopen schools on the 1st in Guerrero - that he is not seeing a bettering of conditions. He is did say that mining and construction may start on the 18th, in line with the classification as ""essential"" under federal guidelinesRegarding hotels and beaches - the tentative date is the 1st of June, The plan to reopen needs to be in line with Federal guidelines. There has been agreement with other state governors that there is coordination on how the openings occur country wide.  One possible option regarding the hotels and restaurants is to allow them to operate at 30% capacity. However no firm accepted plan is in place as of yet. AcaRes - you are right that they are saying they are hitting the peak. Though they said that last week too was going to be the most dangerous time. I honestly think they have not reached peak yet, and worse, they won't know when they do, because of the testing problem. I don't think Acapulco's true peak will happen until after tourism reopens, and people from some of the worst known hit areas - Mexico city and Mexico state - start to descend en masse to make up for lost time. I have yet to hear on any plan from the state or city on how they actually plan to deal with the potential importation of cases into the city. For the spanish speakers - https:/…"
"If any of you ever had experience or family with experience in owning a restaurant, you will know that the profit margins are so slim, 30%, 50% or even 75% opening will still be a money losing proposition. That is a pipe dream. Then there's the problem of whether people will come in sufficient numbers to keep the losses manageable. I don't believe it. People are not as dumb as the politicians they elect. The larger problem of consumer confidence will not go away until they feel they are being told truthful information. I can wait."
"Everything's a guess at this point, regardless of the day to day speculation. Spoke with 3 peeps on the ground in ACA this past week, and all seem to hear & think that it'll be sometime in July when it returns to semi-normal.I agree with Dave. You'll need consumer confidence in order for most businesses to thrive; and I'm thinking that most older people probably won't be comfortable enough to venture out much 'til mid summer. Most people I know are taking a wait & see approach ... to see if the numbers start spiking again. We'll all know a lot more by the end of the summer."
"""Tulum in Guerrero? Where is that?""Taxco in Guerrero. This post was the effect of 40 days sensory deprivation/lockdown.Also have imaginary roommates."
Lol
"Today’s novedades says that more than 10 states refuse to start schools June 1. And yes, Guerrero is one. Imagine that. The teachers have spoken. Next cycle would be September 7Edited: 3:09 pm, May 16, 2020 "
Isn’t it a little too early to start back to school? From a social distance standpoint? Everything shuttered but schools open?
Near impossible to purchase Corona in ACA.
"So I was originally set to travel in March. Of course, that got rescheduled for late June as it was basically the only dates work wise I could push it to for the rest of 2020. FA looks like it's going to be open and I haven't cancelled the flight yet. Assuming hotels open on June 1 as planned, what do you guys think? Not looking for a moral seminar, we are 3 guys in late 20s healthy and will self quarantine when back in the US if necessary."
"I think that any vacation in Acapulco at the eend of june is going to be very quiet. I don't think clubs will be open, and entertainment will be severely limited. If you are looking for nothing more than beach and pool and relaxing, you could do that. If you are looking for more excitement and nightlife, I would hold off. I have been eyeing the beginning of July for my own trip (not focused on nightlife), but I have not pulled the trigger yet. The news coming out of the country in general is not good. I will probably wait until the end of may to make any decision. The June 1 date is proving to be too ambitious for the schools, and I there is no hard date on Hotels/Restuarants yet. The June 1 date for beaches is a hope, but I have yet to hear any firm official word on that."
We will wait till restaurants are open. Beaches open. Booze flowing. Could run thru the household supply fairly quickly.
"RFNJI mean if you do go in June or July the deals must be incredible right, at least from a Hotel perspective they'd be doing everything they can to get business back ? Not just hotels, but my guess is Airlines, and restaurants as well.  I saw for me in November a round trip ticket American Airlines to Fort Myers Florida in November for only $184. Wait and you'll probably get Acapulco for next to nothing IMO."
I kind of agree with RFNJ. I mean you would probably be fine and could probably even stay at somewhere usually very expensive like the Princess for very cheap. But the nightlife might be next to nothing. Cannot see Babyo's and Palladium being open and if open probably pretty quiet.Must guess is Samantha's might be open and maybe that is all you would need LOL !let us know what you do if you go and how things are
I would think that after mid June the weather would be off putting anyway.

"From the mayor yesterday, nothing but difficult news. The number of cases in the city is 520, with 38 deaths. Hospital capacity is at 80%. They have started digging mass graves. Guerrero is ranked third in the country in growth rate of the virus. She is imploring that people believe that this is real, that the hospitals are becoming saturated, and to stay at home."
38 deaths and mass graves??? I listened to one speech. A few of her pieces of information were pretty messed up. Did you get to listen to her? I can send you the video.

TODAY and ALWAYSNote - This is a small friendly boutique spa which Val and I visited for a couples massage when we were last in Acapulco. Great little spot, pleasant bilingual manager, respectful staff. Wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend them, and their FB post reflects their attitude. Not surprised.Edited: 7:23 am, May 24, 2020 "
"On a personal note ... we hope that all of our Acapulco friends (here in the U.S. and Canada, and those who are SOTB) are doing well and keeping themselves safe. Still looking forward to the day when we can celebrate life again ... at one of our many favorite spots on the bay. As for us, all's good to this point. Still observing the stay-at-home recommendation except for essential matters ... and will wait to see how the next few months unfold as our small state goes through its re-opening phases. Better safe than sorry. Be well."
"Still insufficient testing, no viable therapy and no vaccine. Politicians are acting like the mayor in Jaws. If they ignore the scientists, we will see a lot fewer of our friends when we return. I have closed down every practice area of my business that would require face to face contact. About half my revenue is on hold, yet at 50% we are still paying our bills and our people. Those with a cushion will survive, those without may not, but if their workers and clients don't get through safely, even survival might not be enough. Some of my friends at PDLC are pretty cavalier about this threat and that scares me to the core."
"Just watched a video of the Mercado all shut down. They also shut down some private celebrations, the mayor is imploring people to stay at home, and the hospitals are at capacity. This is a global problem but it will affect our friends in Acapulco severely. Acapulquenos are tough and capable. Hope they get it under control."
"When the mayor has to keep trying to convince people that this is actually a real disease, and not a trick of the government/conspiracy, I lose hope. In addition to private celebrations, they also had to shut down a flea market in Zapata with several hundred vendors. And if you can believe it, I was watching a recent ""Acapulco in Quarantine"" video, where beach vendors were going onto the beach trying to sell things. This was in the last few days, and right in front of the ""beaches closed"" signs. Every day the police and guard are catching bars and antros trying to operate in secret. Glad to hear you are keeping your business afloat, Snork. I know many whom have not been as lucky."
"School will not start in June as had been hoped. And probably not July either.........GUERRERO.- El gobernador Héctor Astudillo Flores, indicó que el regreso a clases no será en junio, como se tenía previsto al inicio de la pandemia.Asimismo, dijo que tampoco es probable que sea el julio, pero eso dependerá del semáforo epidemiológico de la pandemia.“En junio solo regresan a actividades la minería y la construcción, como ya se había informado, pero el regreso a la clases no es posible, ya que estamos en foco rojo del semáforo de la pandemia”, comentó.El mandatario dijo que en próximos días se informará de manera más precisa el rumbo que se tomará en la Educación, así que pide la cooperación de padres de familia y personal docente, a seguir con las clases virtuales.Edited: 11:53 am, May 27, 2020 "
"How are you managing, Res? Anything we can do from afar? Are you an ex-pat? Enough income or savings to get you through? Others in your situation? I know some ex-pats that qualified for permanent residence status and for that they had to have independent sources of income or show substantial savings. Trying to imagine how I would react if I were on the ground as a resident. If there was a chance to leave would you? Canada has been very good to me but I've seen my share of winter weather. Summer is almost in Canada. No sun destination is available during this pandemic, and certainly none as appealing to us Nortenos as Acapulco."
Article in today’s news paper- hotels in Acapulco will NOT be opening June 15. Another article talks about some international flights to Zihuatanejo beginning June 27.
Are no flights allowed into Acapulco currently?
"There are flights into the city, just limited, from the mexican carriers. I don't think there are normally any international fights/charters during the summer months? I know American is a no, but maybe someone knows about united. I listened into a conference call yesterday, Cancun is going to open up hotels to tourists next Monday in limited capacity. Hotel workers already reported back las Monday. Los Cabos will be ""soon""Both those cities have strong interconnections between the various hotel, restaurant and transport associations, and are working in coordination with the state governments, who have final say. A rep from AM Resorts (Dreams) was on the call, but his part was less on reopening dates than steps they are taking to ensure safety when they do. Given that the latest I read is saying Acapulco's peak (the same one they called for Mothers day week, and again last week) is now predicted the last week of June. So I don't expect to see openings of any sort until mid/late July. Maybe the beaches just to locals in the beginning of July, but I am jsut guessing there."
Looks like United is flying from Houston into Mex city. Aeromar from there to Aca.  Prefer not into Mex city. Their health Minister is saying Sept. much longer than others are quoting
"Flights into and out of Mexico City have been running, albeit at a lower capacity of course. I believe, from the sounds of the article I mentioned, with Zijuat, it expressly mentioned international flights. And of course, that is good for us here, international is going to start there....thus me mentioning it. I never meant to imply that there were no flights out of Acapulco........but, I must say, that when a plane is heard overhead, it's an attention getter. You don't realize the noises you have missed until you hear it again."
Res I think you were correct. Painful. In todays papers they are quoting the Governor as stating that flights were not allowed into Acapulco at this time. They will resume after Acapulco and the state clear off the “Red” status. Might be awhile at the current rate.
"May 28 message is completely outdated. Masks are compulsory in many stores, except the many shut ones. Distancing marks on the floor at waiting lines are widespread. Temperature measuring will keep you out if you have fever. Large stores clean carts all over. Hand cleaner liquid will be sprayed onto you before you enter the bus. Public hand wash systems are in place. Beaches are closed, so was Zocalo as of all June 2020."
