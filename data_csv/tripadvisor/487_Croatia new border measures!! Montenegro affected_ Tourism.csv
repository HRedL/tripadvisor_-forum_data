I'm a UK citizen that is flying into Dubrovnik. I also wished to visit Kotor and Zabljak in Montenegro and then return back to Croatia to fly out again from Dubrovnik. Is this possible with the new measures? Does Montenegro count as a third national country? Will we need to do a PCR test? We also had hoped to visit Sarajevo and Mostar but this seems unlikely to happen due to border restrictions.

Thank you!!! This is incredibly helpful and a great way to circumvent the rules:)
Croatian measures to Montenegro does not affect you as UK citizen. Also tourists who come to Montenegro from EU can travel to Croatia and back without negative test or self isolation.
Hi-does anyone know where we can get tested in Dubrovnik or in Kotor for covid-19? We are going to Mostar from Dubrovnik and negative COVID-19 (PCR) test result not older than 48 hours is reuired in order to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina
