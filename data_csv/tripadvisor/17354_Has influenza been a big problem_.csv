A friend has told me that there has been nearly an epidemic of flu in Italy recently. Can anyone tell me if this is true and if it has abated yet?
like every winter influenza arrived ... of course the press had to create allarm about it but in reality it's ok there is still some around but nothing you really need to worry of
