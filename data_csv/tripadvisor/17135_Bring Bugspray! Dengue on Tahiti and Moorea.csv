"Going soon? Make sure you pack insect repellent! www.bugggspray.com is my recommendation for good protection in FP! This news today from Tahiti Infos (translated to English):........................Beginning of an epidemic of dengue confirmed Moorea and Tahiti  The Directorate of Health issued a press release warning the public against the dengue epidemic that now affects Tahiti and Moorea: ""Now, since the first case of dengue identified 6 February 2013, nine new cases have been laboratory confirmed and several other clinical cases are suspected. These people residing in Moorea (Haapiti district) and Tahiti (Punaauia, Tipaerui and Mahina) measures of patient isolation and the fight against mosquitoes were taken by services health, supported by communal services. The current epidemiological situation shows the existence of two active foci of transmission and 2 other sites potentially contaminated. recently, it was revealed one case of dengue type III, in addition to case of type I identified above. co-existence of two serotypes may increase the occurrence of severe disease. Consequently, health officials say the beginning of a dengue epidemic, for now localized in Moorea and Tahiti. The all municipalities where officers were trained for search and elimination of mosquito breeding must be mobilized. Removal of mosquito breeding places in childcare (schools, kindergartens, nurseries, sports clubs, etc.). and patients (medical practices) is a priority. Everyone is strongly urged to strengthen its efforts by conducting weekly to eliminate stagnant water to eliminate mosquito breeding, both at home and in workplace. There is only then that we will be able to slow the spread of the epidemic. Finally, it is recommended to consult promptly if you develop signs suggestive of dengue fever (high fever brutal joint pain, headache). persons likely to be affected must always be protected from mosquito bites to prevent the spread of the disease in their families. Details of the research and the elimination of mosquito breeding are available on the website of the center of hygiene and public health: http://www.hygiene-publique.gov.pf/ For further information, please contact: - Dr Pierre-Henri Mallet, Head of Office Watch health for the epidemiological situation (48.82.02) - Glenda MELIX, Head of the Centre of Hygiene and Public Safety, for measuring vector control (50.37.47) - Dr Xavier Malâtre, Head of Planning and care organization (48.82.48)tahiti-infos.com/…........................."
"Sounds as if the situation has gotten worse since we last discussed (tripadvisor.com/…46851812). though from reading the above I'm not sure it qualifies as an epidemic. Maybe a translation issue.While we had insect repellent with us, I wondered how many people saw the sign while waiting in line at the airport's arrival area and thought ""uh-oh""."
"It's not all the mosquitoes...only a few that are infected. A friend in Tahiti told me...it's only the ones with the striped legs. So just watch out and make sure you don't get bit by the ones with stripes on their legs. ROTFLMAO!! While there's a very good possibility you won't run into any mosquitoes at all... especially if you are saying at the nicer resorts....you should still bring some repellent with you anyway. You never know what you might encounter while on tours off the resort property... especially ones that go into the into the interior. Better safe than sorry.AND...as much as I know many of you (myself included) are not thrilled about using DEET, you will need to have something around 25% DEET, anything less is quite ineffective."
Thanks so much. Glad we have our bugg spray. Leaving in one week for Moorea Bora Bora and Tahaa!
"We stayed at Moorea Fare Miti for 4 nights at the end of January and by the end of our stay my legs were completely covered in bites. We were using bug spray we bought at the grocery store in Le Petit Village and mosquito coils provided by MFM. There was quite a lot of rain before we got there and the first day so that is likely why they were so bad. I did see the sign in the airport...it's why we bought the bug spray on our 1st trip to the store. Unfortunately the bug spray didn't work that well. Not sure how much DEET was in it, we used the whole can in Moorea and threw it out when we left. I'm definitely going to look into that website Barb for our next tropical vacation!!"
"From my personal experience...the mosquitoes just laugh at the stuff with 7% or 14%. You really do need to have it around 25% to be effective. The stuff Barb recommends is very good...and it smells like vanilla! But if you're not able to get it, Then regular Off or Deep Woods Off work fine....as long as they are in the 25% DEET range.Now to keep things in perspective...so people don't completely freak out over this....consider The West Nile Virus that is currently being spread by mosquitoes in the US....it has been reported in just about very state and especially bad in Texas. Yes, they are 2 very different diseases being carried by the mosquitoes...but do keep in mind you are just as susceptible to disease carrying mosquitoes at home as you would be in FP.In most cases, even if you are bitten by an infected mosquito, you will not die....reactions can very from very mild to quite sick...and only those of us (like me) with compromised immune systems are the ones really are risk of death..No need to worry on resort property if you are staying at a resort, as they spray regularly. If you are staying at places other than the big resorts, use repellent regularly. When you are off property...in the interior, on land excursions, at some restaurants, at the airports....use repellent."
"Okay so maybe it was just me, but I used a natural organic bug lotion that uses cat nip oil and I never got bit when we were in the island interior. I'm sure any bug spray would be fine. I did get bit on the one day I forgot to bring it with, so I know it does work. Honestly, I wouldn't worry about catching dengue fever. The chance would be so small. Happy travels"
"Just got back from tahiti and moorea. My fiancee has dengue. Mosiquitoes are sneeky and plentiful there. I thought i knew mosiquitos being from canada but these ones are very stealthy. Cant say we saw many but they left behind lots of bites.Bring repellent from home, the repellent in stores in tahiti is weak."
I have had very little success with anything less than 25% DEET. I know DEET is really not good for you...but neither is getting dengue or zika. Slathering yourself in DEET for a week or two while on vacation is not going to kill you.Seriously...the low DEET or no DEET natural products do not work very well there. You pretty much need the stuff with 25% or more.Now...do keep in mind the nicer resorts do spray quite regularly....so the mosquitoes are not a huge problem at the resorts. It's mostly when you are off property or when you are staying at a smaller more local place that you will encounter mosquitoes.Also..it is NOT all the mosquitoes. From what I understand it's the ones with the striped legs. So all you have to do is make sure you don't get bit by the ones with stripes on their legs. :)Edited: 6 years ago 
"I second what Patti says, we were at Ninamu last March, and February was very rainy. We actually ran out of our bugg spray, and had to find more. Chris had some he gave us, because the store had none, and I especially was getting eaten alive. When we got to Rangiroa, we bought some locally, I think we tried all 3 kinds, and nothing really worked. When we got back to Papeete en route to Tahaa, we were able to get some off, but not as good as from home.Bring the stuff with 25% or more DEET, for sure. It is worth it! If you end up not needing it, great, but it is not fun to need it and not have it. Even not considering the risk of dengue. This year we are bringing an assortment, wipes, lotion and spray.Edited: 6 years ago "
So I'm reading dates that are Mar 2013 on the original post and beyond. Is this also current situation? TIA
Posts 7-9 are current. The mailman just now delivered my Buggspray recommended by BarbiJKM. : ) Think I'll also get some wipes.
"the doctor at the travel clinic we went to last year to get all our shots/medications before heading to Costa Rica told us 25% deet for sure and even for our daughter who was only 2 then, he said using it for a couple weeks is not going to harm you. Maybe if you used it on a regular basis it would."
"We will start end of march to a cruise and a stay on Bora Bora. You wrote your fiance has Dengue. I hope she will be fine now? Oh, I fear it soooooo much, I think we cancel our trip, really I think so. What about the situation on site? Did you heard from cases of Dengue and Zika? The mosquitos are activ in the day and so what did you do when you were going out of the sea? And how could she get infected? Many thanks for your answer."
"You are not going to have mosquitoes ON the cruise ship, you are not going to have mosquitoes IN the water. It is only when you are on land portions where you will be at risk of being bitten. USE bug spray with 25% DEET when you are on land.. It's really a very good protection against being bit. You can certainly cancel...but you must understand there are problems like this all over the world. You are always at risk of getting something. You can't simply stop living your life and not go to an area out of fear or you will never go anywhere. Use proper precautions and use the proper products faithfully and you will probably be fine.West Nile Virus is becoming quite common in the US...especially the central and south central part of the country.. It is ALSO found in the Mediterranean areas of Europe....so can I assume you won't be traveling any of those places out of fear of getting it?Lyme Disease is also quite prevalent all over Europe as it is in parts of the US. Do you cancel your daily activities in fear of catching it?Both Dengue fever and Zika are certainly not fun to have...but you will recover from it. They're like the flu...you are very likely NOT going to die from it unless you have a very compromised immune system.Obviously you have to do what you are most comfortable with...but do realize many many many more people visiting French Polynesia DO NOT catch the disease than do.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I would highly recommend wearing lots of mosquito spray. As I'm type...my wife is in our bedroom with confirmed Denque fever we know she caught in Moorea. We're not sure where in Moorea but never ventured too far from our resort the intercontinental. We are currently in Bora bora where the day we left Moorea it got very bad to the point we had to use a wheelchair for her to make it to our bungalow...where btw...she's been since getting here 5 days ago.Not exactly the way you thought your long planned out and expensive trip was supposed to go. Although there are good doctors here that make ""bungalow calls"" there is still no hospital in case things go wrong. During the day, you can chopper to tahiti but at night...you're SOL.I can't stress enough...this is like ""WEST NILE"" very painful and long. Please be extra cautious!!!"
"Thank you Petti, yes you are right, absolutely, but you have reed the post of Gerd F. from Canada. His wife is catching the Dengue.....Thats horrible!Gerd, you still stay in Bora Bora now? You don't want to fly home with your wife? I hope she will be fine soon. Is there anyone else who get a Dengue or Zika from the Polynesian Islands?"
"Yes, Gerd's wife does currently have Dengue Fever...and I feel so bad for her...I know it is a horribly painful thing to have...and I can't imagine what it would be like to have...let alone have a vacation ruined by it.. Also known as breakbone fever because of the intense pain in the joints and muscles. Personally I only know of one other person who got it and that was a few years ago and they were supposedly bit on the island of Fakarava. I'm sure other tourists have contacted the disease, but they don't typically come in here and talk about it as Gerd has done.Here's a good summation of the disease from Wiki. As you will see only a small portion of those who are affected actually have extreme symptoms and even a lesser percentage have dire symptoms.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_feverYou MUST be diligent in applying 25% DEET bug repellent whenever you are on land. Even and especially at the airport. My very first trip years ago, I had almost a dozen bites before we even left the airport when we first arrived! Now I make sure I pack some OFF wipes in my carry on and wipe down my arms and legs about a half hour before the plane lands so I am protected upon arrival. Given the typical incubation period of 4-7 days, it is even possible Gerd's wife was infected on the island of Tahiti when they first arrived rather than at the IC Moorea.Again only you can decide what is the best decision for you. But if you take the proper precautions and are VERY diligent about applying bug repellent, you should be fine. And do NOT try to rely on natural repellents. I have had no success with them over there. Use at least 25% DEET."
"Thank you Petti. Yes, I choosed a Care Plus Anti-Insect DEET 50% Spray 60ml - Care Plus and Care Plus Anti-Insect DEET 50% Lotion 50ml and Nobite Spray for the clothes (Amazon.de). You can also by 100 %, but it is like poison. You are speaking from the airports, you also think in the airport of Papeete, which is the first airport for everyone coming on the islands, is full of mosquitos? It is an airconditioned airport, isn't it? You said, on a cruise there is no danger, sure, but for the sightseeing in the harbours you also walk out to see the islands like Moorea, Huahine.... and when you stay for 1 week in Bora Bora you want also go to swim and when you go out of the sea you dont't have a protection against the mosquitos. These things are in my head."
"Yes, I mean the airport in Papeete. No it is not air conditioned. It is a very small airport that is completely open to the outside. I have only been bit in the area outside of customs where you receive your flower lei and also out in the parking lot while waiting to get in the transport vehicle or taxi.No you do NOT want to get the DEET 100% stuff. Even your 50% is probably overkill. The 25% seems to do the job quite nicely."
"Thank you Petti, it seems you're a specialist. No airconditioned airport in Papeete, o.k. Didn't you feel ill after your bites? Or did you stay in the Polynesian Islands not on the outbreak time? I heard that one bit is enough to catch the infect. Can you recommend a place to stay after our arrival in Papeete, because we can check in on cruise terminal not before 05 pm and we are landing at 05 am on the same day in the morning, not so good to spend the time on the airport with no aircondition. Thank you Petti for your good recommends."
Just wondering if there is anywhere in the UK I can purchase the buggspray mentioned?
"I am not from UK, sorry :-) But you can get it by Amazon.co.uk:http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Care+DEET&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ACare+DEET"
Thank you :)
"No I did not feel sick at all, because I did not get bit by any mosquitoes carrying the disease.Not ALL of the mosquitoes are infected. There are several species of mosquitoes there. Only one species carries it...aedes aegypti. So if you get bit by something else you are not going to get anything but an itchy spot. I am only guessing at possible numbers here...but for every 1000 mosquitoes maybe only 1 is infected.. I know those aren't the exact numbers...but it is a very low percentage like that.I truly think you are over reacting to this. Yes, there most certainly is a danger...that is why you should diligently use a bug repellent while on land. But not every single bite is going to result in dengue fever. And many people who do get bit by an infected mosquito do not experience any symptoms at all. Only a small percentage of people have a serious reaction like Gerd's wife.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Dear Patti, thank you for your posts. You wrote there is no aiconditioned Airport in Papeete. Are there airconditioned cafes and airconditioned restaurants in the airport at least? We have a few hours to spend there."
"Sonnestrandmeer,Sounds like a little bit of knowledge is freaking you out. Do you realize you've already been to places that have a higher risk of dengue fever? I took a look at the list of places it says you've been. How did you survive Thailand and Indonesia?Still I totally understand fears. I have many of my own irrational fears."
"Lovin Maui, yes we visited a lot of places in the world. I' m still alive. :-) But there never was a epidemic warning of Dengue and ZIKA during our stay! I read now a lot of storys of poeple visiting FP and they are getting ill, so I fear it, because I get loved by mosquitos and we don't have any experience with day-active infected mosquitos, so you are absolutely restricted in terms of the activities."
"Sonnestrandmoor,Sounds like you have a difficult decision to make. Odds are you'd be perfectly fine, even if you get bitten multiple times, but of you're going to be worried the whole time that's not much of a vacation. Vacations are supposed to relax you and it sounds like it won't be the case with this one. When are you scheduled to go?"
"Lovin Maui, yes holidays are for relaxing, sure. We are going end of march."
"I am on Moorea now, and the Zika/dengue situation has gotten a bit better since the local government has taken many anti-mosquito measures, spraying constanly around the island. However, March is still rainy season and there are mosquitoes everywhere. I have a CASE of Buggspray with me, and we are burning coils night and day. Everyone I know who lives here has had Zika since November, but none of my friends has an active case right now. I'll update this post as the month progressses...Edited: 6 years ago "
"Barbi, sorry, you wrote everyone of the local poeple had Zika, but no one of your friends had an active case. What do you mean with active case, Dengue? Do you mean with friends, your friends who visited FP or do you mean the local poeple friends?"
"My local friends who live on Moorea have all had Zika since November (at least 20 of them). The only report of a tourist getting ill with dengue here on Trip Advisor is Gerd's wife's terrible situation. The original post I wrote here was a year ago, and since then preventitive measures have been taken by the resorts and the local government to reduce insect infestations.However, this is the tropics. March is rainy season. There WILL be mosquitoes here. Not all mosquitoes carry Zika or dengue -- you could have a dozen bites and be perfectly fine.It's a risk, just as there are many risks with all travel. If you are the type who will worry about this so much that it will ruin your vacation, better not to come this time of year. If you do come, bring insect repellent, use it religiously, and burn coils."
"Thank you Barbi, yes we will bring bugspray 40% and 50% Deet, of course. But what you think is the best time for FP? The cruises are always in the month of february, march and April in this area, so we didn't assume the best time for the FP. We didn't know about disease on the islands and also our travel agent didn't say anything. Everywhere we traveled before we know the current situation but never thought FP is not a good place to have relaxed vacations. It was a contretemps - or a fluke - as we have learned from the disease on the islands."
"SonneStrandMeer, we are going to French Polynesia this week for our 6th time, 5 of them in the month of March. Dengue fever is possible in any warm weather, tropical climate, and in fact there were cases of it in Texas this past year. We do realize Dengue exists, but we never, ever let that interfere with the great time time we have there each year. French Polynesia truly is paradise and a magical place, I hope you can put aside your fears and enjoy it too. By the way, I have some semi-serious to serious health issues as well, but I'd rather choose to enjoy life than to worry about things. :)"
"Calg, yes I understand your words, really. FP is also my biggest dream and I suppose I become equally panic when I see a mosquito and this will spoil my whole vacation. I read in another thread from a lady just like me and she got some mosquito bites although she used DEET. And she was in panic when she came down with a cold on site, but it was only a cold. And that's like me. Don't think I enjoy my holidays so much. Tomorrow we will get to know the costs when we would cancel our trip, unfortunately it is a very expensive matter. I'm very sad. We start from germany and that is a long, long way. Perhaps we will start again in a better season and not when there is an epidemic."
"Sonnestrandmoor,As stated already this is an old thread from March of 2013. Tahiti does not currently have a dengue fever epidemic warning. Yes, they have had an zika fever out break but that is NOT dengue. Related but not the same. You seem to think they are the same thing. You have a chance of catching dengue fever in any tropical location even if there isn't an outbreak or epidemic."
"Oh, and if you do cancel your vacation and go somewhere else may I suggest you don't go to Bali again. They have been in an epidemic since 2010 and it's expected to peak in 2015. Have you been there in the last few years? Also Thailand has been in their worst epidemic in 20 years. Been there in the last few years? Unfortunately dengue fever is on the rise and chances are you've been places where you would have had much higher odds of getting dengue fever than in Tahiti right now. You need to travel with someone that the mosquitos love even more than you. ;)Edited: 6 years ago "
"Sonne~ This is a perfect case where too much information is a bad thing. You would have been much better off not knowing there was an issue with Dengue or Zika at all. Yes, there is a very slight chance you could get bit by an infected mosquito. BUT...you are lucky to have an advanced warning to use repellent and you'll very likely be fine. Just think of all the people who go there without any knowledge of it and have no warning and use nothing....most of them have no issues at all. You can NOT worry about every possible problem you might experience. Are you worried about the plane crashing? Or being blown up by terrorists? Or encountering severe turbulence? Or getting in a car accident on the way to the airport? Or maybe getting food poisoning or norovirus from the food on the cruise ship? Having a heart attack? Getting blood clots from the long flight? Being bitten by a shark? Or a baracuda? Or a Moray eel? Or being stung by a sting ray? Getting a severe sunburn? Scraping your self on coral and having it become infected? Falling and breaking your leg or your neck? Getting hit on the head by a falling coconut? Being struck by lightening? Being caught in a tsumani? My goodness there are hundreds of things that can happen to ruin a vacation. Are you worried about all of them enough to cancel your trip?Trust me...far more tourists get food poisoning or coral infections and severe sunburns that get Dengue Fever. You have to put things in perspective. You are going to be on the ship 75% of the time...and probably in the water another 15%. So you would only be at any risk of being bit for about 10% of the time you are there. Take precautions by diligently using repellent during that 10% of the time and you'll very likely be fine.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Thank you four your comments. I have read a message, posted in january. Don't know how to feel about this news. escapingparadise.com/zika-dengue-fever-outbr…Lovin, we was in Bali and Thailand more than 10 years ago. Yes Patti, you are right, there are always risks in our live and sometimes it is also not so good reading too much. I will let you know about our decision as soon as possible. Thank you for your friendly assistance."
"Sonnestrandmoor, We really hope you go and don't miss out on Tahiti due to an irrational fear. Heck, if my only option was to stay in a spider filled bungalow I probably wouldn't go either, or I'd just sleep on the beach. I hate spiders of any form.Luckily mosquitos seem to leave me alone but they absolutely love my husband. Even when I do get bitten I hardly notice it. His bites are huge."
"Ohhhh Lovin, I hate spiders also, I fear it very much and so when we stayed on the Seychelles my husband has to check every day and night our room, that there are no scary palmspiders. Mosquitos only loved me, not my husband. :-("
