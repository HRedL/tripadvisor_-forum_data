"Just getting organised for our family trip in August, recall that there have been 2(?) deaths in Bali from rabies. Think they were in Kuta. Has anyone heard if there has been any occurances in Ubud? Don't want to put the kids through the vaccines (heard that it is very painful). Already started the lecture about not touching dogs in Bali - if I start now the message might since in before August.Thanksadia63"
I dont think you really need to worry your doing your bit about not toaching the dogs and dont think your kids will want to touch them after they see them most will stay out of your way used to all the foot traffic 
"adia,I too am heading to Bali. (in 4 weeks....can't wait. I am sick of the cold!). My friends and I have looked into the rabies situation. Apparently the rabid dogs tend to come out at night on the beaches around Kuta. Don't go near them...you wont anyway they stink! Also been told not to go to the Monkey Forest. Monkeys are great carriers of Rabies and other infectious disease. Whilst Rabies is treatable in Australia, health care providers are not as advanced in Bali. For your peace of mind, especially as you are staying near monkeys in Ubud, at least consider vaccinating your children. It only stings for a second, no worse than tetanus shots really. They may have a sore arm for a few days. Keep an eye open, any animal that looks sick, stay away. Rabid Animals tend to have saliva around there mouths and generally dont look well. Enjoy your holiday!Alpha"
Many thanks for the replies re rabies in Bali. Much appreciated.
"There has been no incidence of rabies in monkeys, only dogs. But having said that take the same precautions, look but don't touch.Yes there have been deaths BUT in all cases treatment was refused or not followed up by the patient. Medical facilities in Bali know exactly what to do in the very unlikely event of someone being bitten. The Australian medical authorities have released a statement a few months ago stating that it is not necessary to have the preventative vaccines before traveling to Bali as the post trauma treatment (if required) is just as effective.Bali dogs are timid by nature, I'm sure you will not have a problem."
"The area affected by rabies has at this stage been contained to the south of Bali, around the Uluwatu area and there has been one case in Denpasar."
"There is an article in todays Australian newspaper about rabies in Bali at the moment.Because of an outbreak of rabies in September there is a very low supply of the vaccine for rabies in Bali. Aparently Sanglah General Hospital in Denpasar only has vaccine available for 12 people.9 people were supposed to have died from rabies last year with them warning people to stay away from stray dogs, cats and monkeys.In Seminyak they have been clearing the streets of stray dogs though still worth being careful."
"The rabies problem is serious, but getting overblown.In the past week days I walked from Echo Beach to Kuta and Ungasan in Bukit to Jimbaran and Kedonganan Beach.Almost every dog I have seen has a collar, which means the dog is safe. I have not seen any dogs that look sick. I have not seen any dogs I think look rabid. No dog has bothered me and they are mostly timid. The local authorities have unfortunately, culled most of the street dogs. Any that are found are captured and euthanized. I have heard there are restrictions on moving dogs around Bali, and in particular to Ubud. I doubt those restrictions would work. I agree rabies shots are not need - just stay away from the Bali Dogs. Its a personal decision."
rabies is a problem - and you must be immediately treated once bitten because if you do have rabies and develop the syptoms you will die.
"Whinnie,Read recently that the rabies epidemic has now spread to 6 or 7 regencies - so more widespread than just the south now.Wendy"
"Yes, that's right wenful, but have a look at the date of the original post. That info was accurate at the time I wrote it."
"Hi thereI ended up having my rabies jabs.... more painful to the bank than my arm. This is the information I got from the Biritsh Foreign Office website:There is a risk of rabies throughout Indonesia, in particular in Bali. In December 2008, local officials reported an outbreak of rabies in Bali, following a small number of deaths in the village of Ungasan in Uluwatu district (Badung Regency). In 2009, the presence of rabies was also confirmed in the Kutah area of Bali and in Pecatu village, near Nusa Dur. Sanglah Hospital in Bali has prepared a special area to treat people suspected of being exposed to the rabies virus and doctors in other clinics in Bali have been trained to care for potential victims. A small number of deaths, from rabies, at Sanglah Hospital have been reported in 2009. For further information about rabies see the NaTHNaC website.Our doctor recommended getting them, and as it was the NHS, it wasn't like they were trying to profit from it. At the time of having the jabs (May 2009), it was said that there wasn't any or enough immunoglobulin in Bali. Although it seems now that Sanglah Hospital us geared up towards it.The thing to remember about rabies is that if you are bitten by a rabid animal and DEVELOP rabies symptoms then you will die. (not trying to scare you, its just the facts). There is no cure. The message is, that if you are bitten you must get to the hospital within 24hrs for the jabs to hopefully stop the rabies symptoms DEVELOPING. Even if you have the rabies jabs, you will still need to go to the hospital for at least 3 more (or may be 2). Its 5 if you haven't had the jabs at home.Another thing to remember is, for any reason should you need to be air lifted and it was because of rabies and you haven't had any recommended jabs then your insurance might not cover you. A lot of insurance companies in their small print say that if you don't have the recommended jabs then you aren't covered for problems should any arise say from that illness.Anyway, its really down to you. Perhaps talk to your GP or nurse for advice. The threat of rabies changes all the time. Most GP surgeries have up to date info from NaTHNaC and the WHO etc.Having said all this, I didn't see one rabid dog, cat or monkey in the two weeks I went and that included visiting the monkey forest."
"One other thing to remember is, if you think you do want jabs then you can leave it up until 1 month before you go. So you would have 1 on day 1, another a week later and then another 3 weeks after that. So if you aren't planning on going for a while you can leave it.Plus when you get back you can have another a year later and as far as I remember you would be covered for 5 years.Another thing to take into account if you are in the UK. Is that supplied of rabies jabs are short and currently are supplied from France. But I seem to remember that our nurse said they hadn't been approved by NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) in the UK....... oh well its too late now!"
"I really think we need to let this thread die a natural death, please. The original post is so old that the original replies are no longer accurate in the information that they give out. This is dangerous.If you want to talk about this subject, start a new thread so that all the info can be current and accurate and any new members reading about rabies for the first time, aren't going to be reading out-of-date info.Please just let this one die.........................."
"Hi,Suggest everyone get your rabies shots before you go- expensive but it will be so..so... expenisive if you get bitten and need one of the injections that is currently unavailable on Bali. This is the one that activates the vaccine.I was bitten by a pet dog ( my own silly fault) who had already had the rabies injection, but popped into BIMC for peace of mind and they started the injections but did not have the one mentioned in the link below.Since my return I have been informed by a nurse that there is a world wide shortage of this particular drug.However as I was due to fly within 48 hrs it is was ok for me to get it here in Sydney.If it had been at beginning of my holidays I would have had to buy a new ticket to return home.Here is the post from LP Thorn Tree written on Nov 3rd ( I got bitten on Nov 4th.)www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/message.jspaâ€¦Pamela"
"Sorry, Whinnie, I can't agree with the idea of letting this thread just 'die a natural death' as rabies is actually spreading in Bali, and is a constant issue in every issue of the local newspaper. Supplies of vaccines are indeed still low, and dog vaccination programs are patchy, as is a sense of anyone 'owning' many of the dogs.No tourists have died yet, but over 12 local people have in the last year and the disease is spreading across the regencies. I agree the initial comments about 'rabid dogs come out at night' or 'just stay away from them' is not helpful, but overall the issue deserves attention. People often can't believe how MANY dogs there are in Bali. You can't just avoid them.. they are everywhere. I only live 4 kms outside Ubud and I had to pass 47 on my way home one night- I'm on a motor scooter so at least I can get away from the more barky/charging ones, (NOT all Bali dogs are timid, small or weak) but friends who have stayed at my house have been badly scared by dogs charging at them when they are on bicycles... and as one symptom of rabies is attacking moving objects, that's not so nice! There has been some culling of the worst street dogs, (thank heavens in my opinion- they are dangerous for many other reasons than just rabies) but you can't often tell if a dog is sick.. they can turn vicious quite suddenly and so called 'pets' have been implicated in many attacks, not only rabies related ones.So if people want to consider rabies shots, fair enough."
"I don't mean let the issue die, Newgabe. What worries me is that a lot of the info in the first page of this particular thread is now out of date and wrong. This is because rabies is spreading. What I was suggesting was that THIS thread be allowed to die and a new one started on the subject.That way all the info on the subject will be up to date and current.It was very evident that the people who started posting to this thread again, (as it must have been on about 100 when it was revived, given that it was started over 5 months ago) didn't look at the dates of the original post and replies. This is a common mistake. And a lot of the time, it doesn't matter. In this case, it does.The info we give out needs to be up-to-date. I am very concerned that a new user of this forum will read this thread and again not see the dates on it and think that the info given on the first page is current.Start a new thread on the subject so that everyone can be clear of the real situation as it stands today, not 5 months ago."
"OK thanks Whinnie, I understand your thinking now and I will start a new thread. Is it possible to have moderators lock this one?CheersGabe"
You can certainly ask. I will too. forumsupport@tripadvisor.com is the email address I think.
"Hi,Yes, I agree that a new subject should be started because Rabies kills and there has been so much rubbish written earlier on like people refusing treatment when they have contracted the disease.They would have died anyway unless they were in a major western hospital where they are experimenting with treatments.Did anyone see the television show on Medical Miracles- one of the shows is dedicated to the young woman from USA or Canada who became the first person in the world to survive rabies.The doctors at the Travellers Medical Centre in George Street Sydney told me the other day now two more have survived the disease so nowthere are only 3 people in the world who have ever survived the disease called rabies- it is a deadly disease.Pamela"
