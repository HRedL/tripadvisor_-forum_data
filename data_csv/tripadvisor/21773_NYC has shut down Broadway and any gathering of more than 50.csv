"NYC has shut down Broadway for at least 4 to 6 weeks. No gatherings of more than 500 people. No sports. How long till Las Vegas starts to restrict things? We are booked Mothers Day weekend.

"Once we hit bottom, the only way is up."
When do we hit bottom?
Someone decided that the show mustn't go on?No doubt a good call in the circumstances.
"More smoke and mirrors that accomplishes nothing. Did they close all the buildings where more than 500 people work at? Did they close all buses, subways and elevators where people are squeezed in like sardines. Realistically a 6 foot radius is your contagious zone, you are not going to infect more people if you are in a stadium with 50,000 than if you are in a conference room with 50 people."
"I work across the street from Bryant Park on 6th Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) between W. 40th and W. 41st streets and the city is still open, but very quiet. On a nice day like today the park is usually full of people and even though there are people there it is much less then normal. Our ""lovely"" mayor is saying that the city is staying open and so is the transit system. He also said that there were no new cases overnight so hopefully that's a good thing and not just false hope.I just take all normal precaution like washing my hands and not touching my face when I am on the subway and use my hand sanitizer when on the subway. That's all we can do and just DON'T PANIC because this too shall pass.Edited: 3:26 pm, March 13, 2020 "
I thought this was the Las Vegas thread.
"Yeah, really... thanks for the info. But...."
Our trip is planned for April 13th..... not sure how long to wait to make a decision.
^^^^canceling trip to New York or Las Vegas? This is confusing
All TA rules aside I was interested reading about NYC. Love that place.
"""No sports. How long till Las Vegas starts to restrict things? We are booked Mothers Day weekend. Trying to stay positive.""I DID ask about Las Vegas. Guess some just can't read."
"^^BigDaddy, I think they might have been mentioning the italianprincess response but who knows and who really cares, lol"
"We too are booked for Vegas May 5-12...seems like several restaurants and a lounge in the very hotel were booked at are temporarily closing now. Just saw that this am. We have MANY things planned and booked. Idk how it's gonna shake out, but doesn't feel too smart to go atm. Have you made any decisions? Wondering what all the cancellation policies and booked planned may or may not have in store for such circumstances. Know hotel has 72 hr deposit refund, but guess we'll see. Haven't made a decision. Just watching one day at a time. Enough is changing here at home already. All stay safe and healthy."
"Not going to NYC is much worse than not going to Las Vegas. One of my favorite destinations in the world- Manhattan.Edited: 11:45 am, March 14, 2020 "
"""Not going to NYC is much worse than not going to Las Vegas.""Want to know more about here? Much more being shut down here than Las vegas. Wait until the subway and schools are shut down."
"@BigDaddy...stay safe. I'm in touch with NYC pals and they're ok as of now, just dealing with the issues at hand.As we are here in L.A. and elsewhere.I'm due late May for LV and a few weeks later for NYC. Not making any decisions yet, and my doctor will likely have the final say."
I usually go to the Italian festival in the fall.
"""I usually go to the Italian festival in the fall.""I guess you don't even know it's called the Feast of San Gennaro? Not an ""Italian festival"". If you are going to fake post at least get it right.Edited: 11:59 am, March 14, 2020 "
I know what it's called.
"Why so jealous, Big Daddy?"
