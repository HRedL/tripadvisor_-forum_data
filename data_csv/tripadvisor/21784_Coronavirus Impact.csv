Did a quick search on forum and didn't find any post so thought best to ask given developing situationFly into Joburg in two weeks from Australia to start an 8 day safari in Botswana and Zambia. I don't see any real news about Coronavirus and South Africa apart from some case reported in north. No one can predict the future of course but was wondering if screening measures have been put in place at airport to address the likely problem developing? Was wondering if lack of any real world wide reporting on situation in SA was a true reflection of the situation?
"Hi and there are reports that about 132 or so S Africanscurrently in the affected area in Wu Han , are to be returning to S.A. in the next few days.Hopefully there are proper procedures in place to screenall coming into the country and to put them into quarantine as precautionary measures."
"Ok thanks, sounds like they have been in quarantine already? Will keep an ear out for news"
"Of the suspected cases in SA, all test results so far have returned negative.The nearest case to us is in Nigeria: https://m.news24.com/Africa/News/nigeria-con…Edited: 12:30 am, February 28, 2020 "
Sounds like the “authorities” are doing the right things even if Ethiopian Airlines lack of action seems a concern
I am flying in from the U.K. in 2 weeks and was wondering the exact thing. Thanks for this
They were scanning everyone for temperature at immigration when I came back the other day. I guess if you did have a temp you would go for further screening.
The returnees will be quarantined for 21 days according to local news sources. Temperature checks have been in place before immigration for years.
There are no reported cases in South Africa. Nearest is Nigeria which is pretty far!!There are confirmed cases in Australia and the US....should we worry about travelling there?
"Body temperature screening has been a feature of arrival into Joburg ORT for some years now, immediately prior to immigration desks. I'm not quite sure what happens if you exceed whatever threshold has been set as normal."

Discover_Nambia - you have misinterpreted my question. My primary concern is having flights cancelled as has happened from Australia to China for example. Not saying SA is anything like China or indeed will ever get anywhere close to that but the best way to ensure that doesnt happen is to have had good screening procedures in place well before now which seems to be the case in SA. I actually expect USA will have bigger problems develop as a bit slow of the mark it seems. As for the real question - if the plane will fly me to Joburg in 2 weeks I will be on it trust me :)
Sorry I misinterpreted. I see no reason presently why Australia would halt flights to South Africa.
"No problems, all feedback appreciated. I agree about flights at present"
"I am flying to the US in 2 months, and am actually more concerned about that, as they don't seem to have much of a plan. They don't even have testing kits in Hawaii yet where I am heading. I know you can't believe everything you read on the news, but yeah, hopefully it will be ok. I am saying that as a tourist, but it seems like that is the US government line, and that is worrisome.The government here, as dreadful as they can be at sone things, have been pretty proactive with this. I live in the Western Cape, but for several weeks now there are hospitals prepared to deal with a situation if it arises.Namibia too are very proactive, also with the temperature screening at the border, but also as their Chinese resident population have been taking extra precautions by not going to China to buy stock."
"Discover-Namibia - Hawaii will do a good job. Testing kits have been sent out and their healthcare infrastructure is one of the best in the country. Almost everyone flies in so hopefully they will be able to be more proactive than the rest of the US. The current plan is “It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear”. No joke. Yes, you can believe sourced news. Use many outlets and you’ll get the truth as best you can."
"There are now two cases of corona virus in South Africa. See this link: https:/…index.htmlIt only mentions one, but there are two, and also 10 others in quarantine (returned from Italy)."
"7 confirmed cases. Your data is a bit old. But, it is the unconfirmed and undetected cases that matter. Tourist arrivals are 10% down so far.Edited: 1:57 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Coronavirus update: SAP confirms temporary closure of Sandton office https://www.fin24.com/Companies/ICT/coronavi…
Proactive steps being taken it seems . It is scary though how even one group of 10 people will spread it through contact
"Flashman we are regular visitors to Africa, especially to Kruger and would not hesitate to go at the moment. We are going back again soon and stopping over at JHB airport, and have been having second thoughts, but honestly my main concern is not the destination but the airline/airport travel!Edited: 9:23 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Totally agree thesandmans. Not worried about my health but rather the Aust Govt/Qantas cancelling flights/entry
"Exactly, Qantas is all over the place at the moment."
I am concerned about bringing more cases to S Africa. We can be contagious without symptoms. Healthcare systems can easily be completely overloaded anywhere with an outbreak. Lots of immune compromised people in S Africa. There are many more cases everywhere than are being tested. I don’t know what is best for S Africa with the loss of tourism or the possible increased incidents of COVID-19. Tough decision.
The southern hemisphere's current high autumn temperatures seem to be killing the virus down south. But the weather is changing . . . . . . .
"Hope so Gerald Sandmans - actually think Qantas are pretty good all things considered . Their latest “ no change fee” offer is weak but in general their response has been sensible and they provide plenty of info including every flight affected to date https:/…health-while-flying.htmlThey will make economic based decisions to cancel some routes or frequency of flightsEdited: 3:53 am, March 12, 2020 "
Weather doesn’t seem to matter here. All over the US we are getting cases - from sub tropical to temperate climates.
I'm leaving tomorrow evening from JFK to for a 2 week stay in Kruger Park and Cape Town. It's to late for Qatar airways to let us change it cancel our tickets. If we reschedule the trip it would cost is thousands of dollars. We saved up years for this trip. I dont know if the private lodges we are staying at will let us rebook for another time. As of now we are planning on going.
How is the travel insurance industry handling this fiasco?
My travel insurance says they wont cover cancelling due to the virus.
What if your doctor told you to cancel your trip?
Most insurances do not cover anything as it is classified as a pandemic and it is usually in the exclusions (even if your DR orders you not to go).
I called my insurance and they wont cover it. If I cancel my Qatar flights I dont think I will get a refund because I needed to cancel it 3 days before departure. My flights leave tomorrow.
Yeah same with Qantas. Different if they cancel the flight of course
My husbands work announced its restricting travel. He is trying to see what that means for our trip. All of this is a mess!!
With regards to travel insurance I know a lot seem to not be covering unless you took the 'cancel for any reason' option.I also had guests of mine contact me and say that as the US raised the travel advisory to level 3 now their insurance doesn't pay out. Not sure about how true that is...but knowing how tricksy insurance companies can be I guess any excuse!!
Gemma sadly neither of the insurance companies we use offer a 'cancel for any reason' option.
"Hi Sandmans.See my other rather long post reply to you.Airlines are being very accommodating with free changes, and lodges too."
My sisters policy had the cancel for any reason and she was told the virus isn't covered. Thats crazy. Why have it?
Serious!! Cancel for any reason is exactly that.My cancel for any reason covered any shortfall I wasn't refunded.They should follow that up. You can't have cancel for any reason but excluding things we haven't known about yet!!
"Thanks Gemma. What we have heard so far from Qantas is that they have changed their policy to allow free changes, if you have recently booked!. Like many we booked last year. BTW thanks for helping here, I just popped in to see if there was any discussion, so it is appreciated."
Aust Govt just upped Travel Advice to Level 3 which means Avoid all non-essential international travel regardless of destination. Guessing we are now officially screwed 3 days out! Qantas may cancel our flights in meantime but the safari part will have to be an insurance claim and don't like our chances there
"Omg what a worry, we are monitoring too. Keep us up to date how you go."
"I just had to cancel my trip, from Australia unfortunately. Insurance does not cover us either. We were due to leave 2 April. Entire family is disappointed given how much we were looking forward to it. But health comes first!"
We are travelling on 1st April and are on the verge of cancelling too. But we don't want to. I am waiting and hoping for some positive feedbacks from fellow commentors who are currently traveling in South Africa.
We fly on 24 March from London - at the moment everything still okay but nothing is set in stone - just got to sit it out for the next 11 days and hope we can go :(
I was suppose to fly out this evening but chose to cancel and we are going to reschedule for the fall. I didnt want to take the risk of getting sick or getting stuck out if stuff gets much worse over the 2 weeks we are gone.It cost us a good chunk of change to do this but you cant put a price on your health. My husband is a diabetic and I have an autoimmune disease and we are at a higher risk. Im not as worried about getting sick while in SA but more so on the crowded long 20+ hours on a plane.
Fly out on Tuesday and have not cancelled yet. Basically we are already screwed financially so waiting 48 hrs makes no difference in that area. In that time Govt may increase level or Qantas themselves cancel flight. That way we at least get some money back. Am not concerned about my health especially but appreciate others are at risk. Also understand getting back may be difficult . Kinda just waiting for that magic sign in next day or two to guide us :)The current level of advance is useless really. Either ban travel or not
I have decided not to travel to SA next week. The main worry for me was that I would actually be travelling from the UK already infected with coronavirus and be totally unaware. I just can't take the risk of that happening and then passing it on.
"Flashman I agree this 'reconsider' advice is pretty hopeless.What an awful situation to all cancelling, everyone loses, so sorry to hear.Personally we are lucky at least we have been many times, but it is still devastating, this long planned trip included new places and was for a special occasion and the financial effect on us will be bad. Sadly the one special place we are staying has been completely inflexible in the way of rescheduling, which is very disappointing, while others have been good. Certainly not counting on insurance"
"For those, like me, who are still trying to decide whether to cancel or not, there is a further consideration for travel to SA. As a pandemic has been declared, many insurers will no longer cover COVID-19. If you do develop symptoms once you arrive in SA, this means that you will need to pay for any treatment out of your pocket. SA public hospitals are already overstretched and of a different standard to public hospitals in NZ Australia UK and Europe. Generally, you would avoid going to these and go instead to a private hospital's emergency room. But private medical costs can be massive if you require hospitalisation, surgery or medical evacuation. Here is a plain English link to latest advice re Australian travel insurance https:/…"
