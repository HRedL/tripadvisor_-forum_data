Hi guys . Was going to travel from England for sxsw next week as we came in 2016 and it was terrific . The festival has cancelled and aren’t offering refunds . We have flights and hotels paid for . What I want to know is will we be welcome if we still come ? I’m not saying you aren’t welcoming people but we don’t want to rock the boat . There was a massive survey suggesting that there shouldn’t be an international invasion in wake of current events .
Who isn't offering refunds? Is that legal to take your money without providing a service? I'll bet you'll get all or most of your money back or an exchange for next year.
The festival are saying no refunds no matter what . They have offered next year but it’s not practical when travelling to far and I’ve no desire to get involved with the official side of things after the way it’s been handled

"Obviously, there will mixed opinions. But hotels, eateries, drinkeries and such, especially their staffs, will be happy if there is some business to make up the loss. Remember that in any given year, you can always get a lot of signatures against SXSW, since it is a giant pain if you're not involved. I don't think anyone will be more worried about you than about people from California and Washington, there will plenty of them there. I suspect a lot of people, like you, will come anyway, and you have to decide for yourself if you also want to join the crowds from all over. I think that for an international traveler, they should watch the Austin news. As yet, there have been no confirmed cases in the region. But should some venue turn into a hotspot, I should not like to one of those traced to contact with patients and grounded./interned pending testing. We do have ten labs in the state capable of testing, although throughput is obviously slow because of the normal facilities and staffing."
I look forward to coming ! If I was really militant I’d probably say that countries should keep an eye on people coming in from China Korea and Italy .....
We have a couple of cases in the north west of England by the way ... most are recovered the other couple ancient ..
"Actually 206 confirmed cases and two deaths in UK as of this morning, and they are in every UK region and in sufficient numbers that I would prefer that people stay home. Bringing people from infected areas, risking bringing in a disease with zero immunity by crowding into entertainment venues in an area so far free of positive cases is just asking for it."
There have been more people that have died of the flu this year than have died from Coronavirus. https:/…
"Yes but Coronavirus is 14 times more lethal. So if and when it spreads to flu levels, there will be more deaths. I'm not panicking. I'm not sheltering in place. I am paying attention and hoping research prevails with options as needed.I can see how folks would want to lessen the chances of exposure by limiting travel from places with more of a chance of spreading. But I wouldn't make folks from England feel unwanted."
"I still plan on coming as well. Austin is an amazing city and I am not canceling my trip. Plus I have heard that a lot of the smaller unofficial events will be taking place and I""m glad for all those involved and plan on supporting."
Come on down. You won't be alone. I would imagine there are 1000s in your same predicament.
VRBO in south Padre Island is refusing refund. I am amazed!

"SaveThey don't have much of a refund policy I can find. They do have a cancel and refund process that is tied to the property's cancellation policy. If the property lists no cancellation policy, I will assume you can cancel at any time.https://help.vrbo.com/articles/Can-I-receive…They also have a stated position on chargebacks that seems to favor the customer. If I tried to cancel and was refused a refund, I would charge it back on my credit card and let them argue it later if they want to."
"""VRBO in south Padre Island is refusing refund. I am amazed!""Why is this the case?"
I'm not surprised. They let owners set the refund policy. AirBnB has angered owners by invoking the special circumstances clause in the terms and conditions to allow refunds when requested. Might bump VBRO off center.
Well sadly I never came back to Austin as the world went mad and continues to get more so day by day . Keep it wierd . Xxx
