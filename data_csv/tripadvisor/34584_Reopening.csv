"<< “ So isolation for 5 days in a government facility? How does that effect my 7 day stay.” >>It will ruin it, for sure.PS - if you read the article again, you’ll see it does not mention “government facility” anywhere."
"You, my friend, should probably just reschedule or go elsewhere. Your 7 day vacation will be reduced to two days unless you count your 5 days of quarantine. Also, double check your fees as the monitor will cost you “ a couple hundred dollars “ and not sure how much for the day 5 Covid test."
"Definitely change your plans - you won't be able to go anywhere or do anything for the first 5 days.Your location says ""Aruba"" - frankly I would stay there...."
Any idea what the monitoring device would be?
"Planning a week in Cayman in October 2020 has not been a viable option since the onset of Covid. Btw the monitor means you will not be in a gov facility as is the case right now for a solid 14 days. There is an awful lot of misinformation being tossed around which just muddies the waters. For those who want to see the monitors google for pics of Dr Lee. He had been wearing one happily doing all sorts of activities and has shown it publicly. Anyone planning on low season accommodations and flights going anywhere this year should forget about it. As long as social distancing is in affect there will not be rock bottom pricing. Space and staff are very precious commodities at this time. The BioTag is super cool.Edited: 10:16 am, July 18, 2020 "
"The monitoring device will be a BioSticker - the company's outline of it is here: https://biointellisense.com/It can monitor* Respiratory rate, heart rate at rest and skin temperature* Body position, activity levels, sleep status* High-resolution gait analysis and fall detection* Symptomatic eventsAccording to the press conference yesterday you will wear that for the first 14 days of your stay on the island, the first 5 of which will be in either self-isolation or in a quarantine facility. After that you are considered to be ""in the bubble"" and can go about life like anyone that has been on island through this.They are most definitely targetting this toward property owners and those that want to stay on the island for a significant period of time, and those that can self-isolate. This is step 1 of a multi-step program that will start up the tourism industry.What they mentioned in the press briefing but I cannot see on the site is that it also has ""geofencing"" which is a form of location detection. Data is sent up to the cloud, where the Caymanian authorities can get it and monitor it."
Tracking body position and activity levels?!? Hahahaha!!! :-)))Why is this needed?
This is the standard product. No clue if it can be configured to store less information or not.
Goodbye Grand Cayman... Hopefully we will be back someday...
I didn’t see anything saying travel insurance would be required.
"I didn't hear any mention of requiring travel insurance either. Getting any form of insurance that would cover COVID-19 eventualities is going to be tough right now, from what I hear."
The 5 days will not be in a government facility. This is not aimed to get the one week visitor back on island. This is aimed to get residents back who have been overseas and dont have a way home. And aimed at tourists who own property on island and may want to come for a month or so. 5 days will be nothing to them. I know a few who have already booked. Good timing as Sept and Oct are the slowest tourist months of the year anyway so this gives a good test run. Hopefully we will all have a magical solution by the regular tourist high season.
The 5 days will not necessarily be at a government facilty.
"As much as I want to go to Cayman and cancelling 2 trips this year. Also, I think it said not all countries would be allowed. I will wait till it is normal to vacation. Vacation should be enjoyable. Best Island to visit for sure.Edited: 4:56 pm, July 19, 2020 "
"The ClearlyCayman resorts sent out a newsletter to their customers today which contains either wildly optimistic forecasts about reopening or they have information which has not been made available to the public or other business owners. I would be interested if there is anybody on island that can somehow back up their claims with a source.First, they claim that ""Phase 2"" tourism reopening will start October 1. I heard nothing like that in what I have read from the government - they said that they would ""reevaluate"" things after 4 weeks and that was it.They claim that Phase 2 will eliminate the 5 day self-isolation requirement - again, I have heard nothing about that.They claim that the Phase 2 will include the return of US Airlines to service the Cayman Island from their hub cities - I have seen nothing about that, either.So did I miss something? Or are they just being wildly optimistic, here?"
"You didn't miss anything, as the information hasn't made it into the public domain. Based on the press conference Friday, the information sound correct. Of course, always dependent on how things go in the US...."
"It’s just another example of misinformation or slightly misconstrued info. While the next phase may start then it is unlikely that the average person with a week to spare will meet all the parameters. Even the airline choices will be limited. It’s the problem with cutting and pasting. I saw someone posted it on Scubaboatd (which ironically often calls out TA for misinformation). The individual who posted it lists himself as a dive travel person. One could only hope someone in the dive travel industry would be better informed or at least go to the source of the information rather than what is basically an advertisement. Of course the link was cut and pasted immediately. Bottom line anyone hoping to book a trip should go to gov.ky and read the latest or google the latest press conference. TB if you have a few weeks, you might get back before the general reopen :).Edited: 8:22 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"They would need to drop the bio button and the quarantine before I would think of returning. I heard the same thing from a local ( minus the US Airways) as TravelBrit, so it must be circulating the island as what the next phase is going to be looking like. Time will tell...."
"I think that there is a lot of wishful thinking going on right now, especially by those that are still in the travel/vacation business. We'll see, I suppose.My biggest concern, Retrip, is the getting safely to and from the island. Right now I am still pretty much staying isolated except for essentials. Going through airports and sitting on a plane with who knows what is far too high a risk for me personally right now. I would love to be there and spend a few months, but it isn't going to happen."
"TravelinMy husband and I were just discussing the same thing yesterday and feel as you do. I still have my flights for the winter but are not too hopeful that we'll be able to use them. Flights especially problematic because they are not direct. I do know a number of people who have flown and they are okay. We too are pretty isolated. :-(Edited: 10:41 am, July 21, 2020 "
It's all about risk - I have no doubt that there are people who have flown and are ok. That doesn't make it safe....
Seems like the message from Cayman is for US travelers to stay home!
Well if it comes to that they will be only mirroring the ban already in place in many countries that have their Covid under some level of control and made different types of sacrifices to accomplish that feat and hope to keep it that way.
This article is talking about people who live on the island and are returning home.
"Yup, seems like those who own properties on GC and can fly in via private Jets, willing to quarantine, having extended stays will be welcome. Good for them! For those who want to vacation for a week, forget about it!"
"Time to explore other options. There are other places in the world where the beaches are beautiful, people are friendly , Area is safe, and Covid numbers were low. There are many places offering incentives to return and not asking people to be tracked on vacation."
Yes. Since the absolute very beginning it has been said the island would hopefully reopen by year end for regular tourism. That is still on track. The reopening plan is measured and in stages. I just can’t get my head around why that is not evident. And for those who have interests on the island it only make sense they want to come back and check on them. The 5 days staying in is a great time to do the normal stuff returning to a second home. This first and second stage is not geared toward the visitors that have a week off. It was never meant to be.
"""Seems like those who own properties on GC and can fly in via private Jets, willing to quarantine, having extended stays will be welcome. Good for them! For those who want to vacation for a week, forget about it!""Just one small correction - there are going to be scheduled flights so that the necessity of a private jet costing a large amount of money is not there.Essentially if you own property on island and are willing to pay the price of the admission (which, although not published yet is in the same ballpark as a tourist visa to the USA) then you have a place to self-isolate, and the cost is probably worth it to be able to live in a COVID-19 free country for a while. 14 days of isolation if you are planning on staying more than a month would be worth it.And as Retrip reminds us, this is just step one, while they get the systems in place and cautiously find out how this can work for them. We will get more details of Phase 2 at the start of October, based on what they said in the press conference. This is low season anyway - in order to try to minimize some of their losses, they are going to do their best to have things up more by Christmas, which is when the high season kicks in and many businesses make the money that carries them through the following low season."
"We are hopeful to start our winter stay around the end of the year. I hope the Govt. is mindful of the holidays when or if they announce the time between testing and arrival. For example, if they use 72 hours and the 72 hour test day falls on Christmas day or even the day before or after ,or on New Years day it may be impossible to get the test or the results in time for a departure 3 days later. Not much gets done the week between the holidays."
"Labs in the USA are unable to keep up with the massive increase of tests being done. Results that used to be available in 2-3 days are now often taking a week or more. Of course, if you are a politician or professional athlete (who are currently being tested daily) their results come back with hours. The craziness seems to have no end."
Anyone thinking of going to alternative island if so suggestions St. John looks like it’s doing great
"St John being the US Virgin Islands, I assume and not the place in Canada. :-)Face masks to be worn in any business, and that includes Taxis. Residents of states that are hotspots for the COVID-19 virus must present test results showing they have tested negative for it or quarantine upon their arrival into the Territory. All bars are ordered to stop serving, and alcohol sales Territory-wide are to end at 11 p.m. until further notice. All beaches close at 4pm on weekends. There are 117 currently active cases, and 7 have died and 261 confirmed infections since it started. They are currently at about a 4% positive test result rate.So yeah, nothing like Cayman in terms of restrictions, but hardly a disease-free paradise....Edited: 10:19 pm, July 26, 2020 "
Don't waste your money traveling to Grand Cayman. The locals are the rudest people I have ever encountered on any vacation and I have taken alot of them. It's a shame because it is a rather lovely looking island.
Pat Six comments that are seemingly based on an experience at one tourist bar. It must have been incredibly bad. Where did you stay? Was anything okay? What else happened.
"Please, Pat Green....tell us more specifics about your trip."
Pat Green is a troll. He/she loves to give terrible reviews of different places. It must be really tough to be so miserable all the time.B.

"One of my planned trips this year was going to be the USVI - I wanted to explore the place and try out the diving there. It's still on my list, once this thing calms down more, but right now nothing short of an emergency will get me on a plane or quarantining - I can do that at home. :-)"
It won't be worth it to go if you have to use up 5 days and you basically can't do anything to enjoy your time.
"Booked for a Feb trip, hoping by then at the very least the testing situation is good enough that they allow pre-trip test and get rid of the quarantine requirement. If not, oh well, won't go."
"Looks like St John isn't doing so great after all. The US Virgin Islands have just been declared ""no non-essential travel"" by the US CDC, along with a whole slew of other islands.Story here: loopcayman.com/content/us-travellers-advised…That's how quickly things change...Edited: 9:24 pm, August 07, 2020 "
Don't book your trip just yet...https://www.caymancompass.com/2020/08/07/govt-extends-border-closures-to-october/
Borders closed as of tonight till Oct 1.
Interesting move by the CDC. Makes you wonder how they come up with warnings. Let’s see — don’t travel to countries that are Covid free? Maybe they don’t want to spread it from their country? The warnings have often been regional not country specific so in inaccurate but this latest is ridiculous.
"I think the warning levels are due to potential quarantines upon arrival and inability to travel more than the actual cases at destinations which have good control with Covid. In the USA people are discouraged to travel from States with low cases to ones where positive cases have increased and you would need to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. People here can now go between R.I. to MA, NY, NJ, or CT for less than 24 hours....but any longer requires the 14 day quarantine. A killer for August tourism at Cape Cod, Block Island, Newport."
"Covid free? Has everyone on the island been tested? Not one asymptotic person on island? If I lived there, I would still wear a mask and social distance and not believe Re: quarantine- Who would spend $$$$ to be quarantined in a hotel room 5-14 days especially if you had children with you? Totally ridiculous!!"
"""Covid free? Has everyone on the island been tested?""COVID-free in that there are no active COVID cases on the island. They have performed 32,299 tests in total. It has been about 26 days since the last test result came back positive. They are performing around 200 tests per day.""Not one asymptotic person on island? If I lived there, I would still wear a mask and social distance and not believe""There are still all sorts of restrictions still in place, including a restriction on the size of gatherings to 50 people, social distancing and mask wearing. SO if you were to do what you say you would be following the government restrictions""Re: quarantine- Who would spend $$$$ to be quarantined in a hotel room 5-14 days especially if you had children with you? Totally ridiculous!!""Except that you won't have to be quarantined in a hotel room. If you have a house on the island then once the first phase of the reopening starts (currently scheduled for October 1, as I understand it) you will be able to remain quarantined in your house for the first five days, wearing the health and location tracker. After than you will be allowed out, but still need to wear a tracker for the balance of the 14 days.This current phase is most definitely NOT aimed at vacationers - it's aimed for those that own property or who have family on island and who plan to stay for a significantly longer period than 2 weeks.As I understand the government statements, this will be in place for a month and they will re-evaluate then.Currently, the Cayman Islands is on the CDC's ""no non-essential travel list"" anyway, so it's kind of academic.There are a few island countries that are currently NOT on the CDC's ""no non-essential travel"" list and who would, I'm sure, desperately welcome tourists right now. The Cayman Islands aren't in that situation.Here is the CDC page, for reference: https:/…map-and-travel-notices.htmlEdited: 12:38 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"The stats speak for themselves and it is pretty clear this little island has achieved getting an excellent handle on Covid-19. Testing 200 per day is a tiny amount for some places, but actually a good amount given their small population. It adds up to thousands over the several weeks with all those results being negative. The last thing they want to do is welcome outsiders possibly carrying the potential to infect their population, put a strain on their resources and cause them to need to go back to the previous severe measures their people endured."
"Glad to see the next step on the evolution of the island in the crisis.loopcayman.com/content/cayman-islands-relaxe…Masks are no longer mandatory, neither is social distancing, and now groups of up to 250 people may assemble.That means all businesses like the movie theater can be open.Also, as reported in loopcayman.com/content/heres-what-you-need-k… the ban on renting of snorkel and dive gear has been lifted.Kudos to the island for getting COVID-19 under control like this - it was drastic, as others have commented, but the lack of new cases based by spread on the island is very encouraging.Edited: 11:05 am, August 26, 2020 "
"But I did read that there were two cases who are in isolation who were on repatriation flights. So as soon as they open up more, wonder what will happen."
"When the Cayman Islands reopen their borders, any incoming Covid cases will be quickly identified via the PCR testing, 5-day self-isolation at the visitor's place of residence, BioButton monitoring for infection presence along with geo-fencing, and technology driven contact tracing. The technology will replace the current requirement of 14 day isolation in government facilities. Understandably not all potential visitors will be willing to go through this process, but for those that do, they will be welcomed into Cayman's Covid -free bubble where daily living includes no masks, unlimited enjoyment of the resorts and beaches, safe indoor dining, snorkeling and scuba diving, attend the cinema, safe shopping, shore excursions,etc. Life here is essentially back to normal and we are so happy! From a Covid perspective, Cayman is now one of the safest places on Earth and in my mind, that makes the minor inconvenience of the entry process worthwhile. Clearly not meant for short term visitors-but when the technology proves successful, even the 5 day self isolation requirement will be lifted."
Couldn’t agree more. For those who want or need to come there are ways. Ironically we are at least on track with those who said Thanksgiving was the earliest the beginning for the likely new normal tourist return with Christmas being perhaps more realistic.
Thanks for detailed information. Still a bit confused. 7 day trip staying a Condo resort. Can family members use the beach and what are quarantine protocols using Bio Button. Does each family member need a smart phone? Resturants? Any more details would be appreciated
The government has not announced nor clarified how much movement within a condo or resort property will be allowed during the quarantine isolation. There is a planned press conference next week where it is possible more details will be announced. I would not plan a seven day trip just yet.
Thanks for reply will put vacation on hold until more clarity by Govt.
"Right now they haven't even said who they will approve to enter once they DO open up, so I wouldn't be planning anything right now, especially if you are coming from the USA.My guess (and it is just a guess based on what people in the government have said) is that no beach will be allowed (that's hardly in isolation) and I doubt the condo complex pools, either. Essentially you will need to stay in the condo. Otherwise it's not really isolation, is it?This will be the first phase of reopening - they said before that they will review after a month and see where to go from there. I doubt very much they will say anything about another phase until they have one month's worth of data on the first phase...IF the first phase kicks in October 1, then they will need the month of October to gather data, which they will review at the start of November, and make a decision. I just can't see that coming into effect until December 1st at the earliest."
Thanks for information. Have moved to end of January now. Hope things get better.
One of many big issues will be if and when airlines resume flights from the USA to GCM. Not sure if accurate but heard that SWA not expecting to do so before April.
"<< “Not sure if accurate but heard that SWA not expecting to do so before April.” >>There will surely be some bit of “chicken-or-the-egg” dynamics here: Airlines won’t start flying again until there’s an increase in demand... there won’t be an increase in demand until airlines start flying again.Edited: 6:24 pm, August 28, 2020 "
"Yes, and until there is clearer policy from the Cayman government about tourism travel issues for those seeking to vacation there the chicken/egg thing is meaningless."
