"This may help from Gambia Customs.....Prohibited• Guns, explosives and ammunition – unless permitted to do so• Knives and deadly weapons• Counterfeit money and goods• Illegal drugs• Pornographic material• Radio-communication equipment not approved for use at destination• Meat, poultry, and many other animal products• Plants, parts thereof, and plant produce including trees and shrubs, potatoes and certain other vegetables, fruit, bulbs, and seeds – unless permitted to do so"
"My baggage few year back contained Tesco goods incl burgers,bacon,cheese,sausage,Lurpack Spreadable,chicken etc when confronted by the porter saying all I had was food a fiver sorted it without the bat of an eyelid,maybe I was lucky as it was a one off.Edited: 12:11 pm, January 24, 2020 "
"When I ytravel I always bring back sausages and assorted meats, cheese and coffee - all vacuumed packed and had no issues.I think plants may be a different issue."
"But many countries around the world are extremely strict on taking foodstuffs like meats raw and cooked,dairy produce,seeds,fruit and vegetables into their countries as they can spread diseases to their crops and animals.Australia and America are really on the ball at customs and some of the fines can be pretty hefty,but you will get receipts for your fines unlike The Gambia which most likely goes in the back pocket thank you very much.Maybe things will be different at the airport when all the building works and security system is finished and up and running properly,and maybe they will even oblige with receipts."

There is a strawberry farm in Gambia. You can get plants from them.
The UK foot and mouth epidemic was traced back to a Belgian family bringing in ham sandwiches....
"You make good point: the compelling reason for import regulations.However Gambia is Gambia so its OK for the English to assume they can take in anything, knowing that it is only Africa and if unavoidable a fiver into an official pocket will enable most things. So, its all right. lol See?"
"Post 9. If that were the case then there would have been an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in Belgium, which was not the case."
