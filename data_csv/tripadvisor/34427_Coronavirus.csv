"my guess is following the recommendations of the Who, the CDC of USA , the center for infectious diseases from Holland as well as from their Minister of Health.you can be sure that Aruba Immigration dept is paying very close attention to the cruise ship visitors too. ...well all visitors actually."
The virus can hit anywhere. Remember the Spanish Influenza that hit virtually every area on the earth except like 2 places? This virus could hit anywhere.

"Look at it this way. We’ve had 16,000 deaths from the Flu this season so far in the US and it is not over yet. The corona virus so far has an average of 2,800 deaths so far world wide and 1 in the US. Take normal precautions and everything will be fine.Edited: 10:14 am, March 01, 2020 "
"MauiDave65, why be a wise ass about someone asking a valid question? Maybe they're traveling with small kids or they are a little older themselves, get real."
"The government is following the advice of the DVG(Aruban CDC). They follow all the needed internationally established protocols. Should testing be needed, the results will be available within 8 to 24 hours. Faster than many countries, the US included. https://www.facebook.com/desparuba/Besides this, passengers from ""risk areas"" will be checked upon arrival. These include people who come from or have visited these countries in the last 14 days; Iran, South Korea, Italy, China, JapanEdited: 11:20 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Im puzzled as to why this question was posed on TripAdvisor? If you live there, you probably have more information than anyone visiting Aruba. Perhaps the question should be redirected for officials in Aruba."
Are there cases of Coronavirus in Aruba
Yes. https:/…
"CAT to put things in perspective...For comparison, the case fatality rate with seasonal flu in the United States is less than 0.1% (1 death per every 1,000 cases).Mortality ratesVirus Death RateWuhan Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 2%SARS 9.6%MERS 34%Swine Flu 0.02%""The transmissibility rate (Ro) should also be considered.Preliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between 1.5 and 3.5. An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear.For comparison, the Ro for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0."
"Does anyone know what property the two individuals who tested positive were staying at, presuming they were vacationers or visitors?"
Are restaurants and grocery stores still currently operating as normal? We are scheduled to arrive 28 March
How many cases and where are they located on island. I’m supposed to go mid April
"All in bound travel banned until end of March, I suspect this will get extended as things will get worse before they get better. There are 2 known and confirmed cases now on the island. I would be mentally preparing yourself to cancel the trip."
