"Hello, does anyone know which travel insurance companies are covering medical expenses for COVID? I’m an American citizen if that helps. Thanks."
None that I know of but there are now a few countries or tourist regions that offer covid risk free travel (insurance)
"There are certainly insurance companies in the UK offering to cover any medical expenses incurred if you catch the virus on a trip, but very few if any who will cover for cancellation of a trip because of Covid-19 restrictions. Travel insurance is of course very specific to your home country."
"I don't know of any that will now, as it's a known problem. However, you can try going to insuremytrip.com. The agents are very helpful there.Edited: 1:42 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"If all you want is medical, and nothing else associated with travel insurance, (1) check whatever medical insurance you have in US to see if it would reimburse you for expenses you incur abroad, (2) if you are over 65 and have a Medicare supplement, check to see if it is one that has the standard reimburserment for overseas medical -- 80% of expenses up to lifetime max of 50k, (3) go on a site like insuremytrip or call them and shop for just medical plans that include C19 coverage and (4) note that others have previously recommended int med plans offered by GeoBlue, a part of Blue Cross."
"Actually, it isn't just a question of your citizenship, but also residency. In US what is available depends on state of residency. If you are permanent resident outside US I have no idea what would be available to you. Might depend on country of residency and you might need to consult expert."

Thanks everyone. I understand the risks for refunds and all that. My question is more about the medical coverage. Meaning will travel medical insurance cover me if I contract corona while traveling. I'm assuming all would cover that as it's not a pre-existing condition but we are talking about insurance companies here..
"Another way to cover should you need the most costly hospitalization part, it is with Air Evac membership. If your destination physician allows you to be moved, you can be evacuated back to the USA where your regular insurance will cover you, at your preferred Hospital. Some memberships cover pandemics at fairly low cost, like med jet Horizon. I have used it in the past but never had a claimhttps://medjetassist.com/membership-optionsEdited: 11:17 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"I don't believe we yet know if the OP, though a US citizen, is also a US resident, which could very well change things."
I am both.
"“I'm assuming all would cover that as it's not a pre-existing condition but we are talking about insurance companies here..”It’s not a pre existing conditions for you but the covid pandemic is now a “known event “ and as such many insurers have decided not to offer cover for it on new policies. Here in the U.K. no travel insurer will cover covid cancellation now, and very few will cover covid medical expenses."
"Assume nothing, Red. Check the coverage and the exclusions very carefully before making any decision. That advice should be followed wherever you are, because every policy on offer is going to be a bit different to the others."
"Seems that active cases of coronavirus are not covered, doubtful that a physician would allow transfers. Don't know if there was Evac coverage for healthy individuals in response to the covid threat, always read the fine print. https:/…medjet-services-alert-coronavirusEdited: 12:19 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Most US insurers chose dates ranging from mid-Jan to mid-March as date when C19 became ""known event"" and the date as of which policies purchased excluded C19 coverage. They were mostly in mid-Jan but a few held out until WHO finally formally declared pandemic.Edited: 12:55 pm, June 18, 2020 "
