"Hey everyone,Its my first time travelling to Bali and I am judt wondering what everyones view on vaccinations is? Some people I have asked have said I should get vaccinations and other people have said they went to bali, didnt get any vaccinations and was fine. I would like to know if people think I should definately get mt vaccinations and if so what ones are most important? Thanks all"
I have had all the necessary vaccinations as I travel to many places. You are much better off going to your doctor and discussing your personal needs. It is far better to have vaccinations rather than risk the symptoms should you contract something.
"Hep A&B and Tetanus are good to have up to date for life at home as well as Bali, get some opinions from doctors though, every doctor will suggest something different, then decide what is best."
"We have never had any vaccine shots, Bali isn't that bad."

When you visit your doctor you might like to mention that there is a measles epidemic in Bali at the moment. One of my adult Balinese friends has just had it in Ubud.
My advice is only seek professional advice !!
As most will say you should consult a Doctor & not a Travel Forum before making an informed decision.Cheers Mac
"We are off in March, but talked to the doc and she said because I am older (is that the way to put it) she suggested a measles booster. That's what we are going to do"
"Your as young as you feel ,Carol :-))Cheers Mac"
"Damn you, IPhone!!!!!!!Cheers Mac"
A stutter Mac... or just boosting your post count? :)Typhoid is often suggested but has been in short supply recently.
Opinions are so different to advice which is a good thing There was someone on here who was going to spen $700 on vaccines recomended by their GP! I would definately be asking for opinions on that one too and then I can have a wider knowledge base to make my decision on.That makes me 101 today Mac!!!! Exhausted. January will bring me into the fountain of youth though!!!!
"As others have suggested, see your GP. Your doctor will give you the options. Personally, I am not prepared to play 'Russian Roulette' with my health and I get the recommended vaccinations. Enjoy your trip :)"
"Seek advice from a reputable Travel doctor/clinic.The majority of people who came back to Australia with Measles recently were adults who weren't vaccinated.I have read on this forum that some GP say ""you don't need anything to travel to Bali"".Ensure you are up to date according to the Australian Childhood Immunisations Schedule (that means 2 doses of Measles, Mumps ,Rubella). Hep A/B & Typhoid are a good idea."
I knew that you would be lurking somewhere Gregarious !!!Cheers MMMMMMMMac
"Thank you BLuvsBali!! Your opinion has been the most helpful thus far :) Of course I am going to seek actual advice grom my GP first! But opinions are different to advice and they help me make an informed decision. I appreciate all the updates from you all, I have booked in to see my GP.Thanks again and happy and safe travels to all.Edited: 6 years ago "
You really wonder why you bother sometimes!!
