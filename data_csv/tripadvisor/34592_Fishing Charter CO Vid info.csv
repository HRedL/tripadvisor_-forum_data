Good - I hope fishing charters can do as much as possible to proceed this summer with business! :)
Concur CM. It should be a great season for fishing with less pressure on the fish.Due to the virus... a bit more complicated. lolAs long as everybody does their part it will work!Now.... I have to figure out how to blame the virus for me not catching fish sometimes.... Best.... BoatAk
"Hey BoatAK...- I believe you are (or were) in the charter business, so for the most part doo the new rules mean:- less customers on a boat?- more time for a captain/crew to spend setting up & shutting down a charter?If the above are true, then do you think the market will support the higher price that has to be charged? I'm thinking there still are travelers that would pay a premium.tks, Scott"
"That's easy, Boat. Take your pick:  https://images.app.goo.gl/BdkxzjiwGb8VtZyC9 or https://images.app.goo.gl/dir6qbs3iiQcPgUi6"
"Hey Scott, Used to Sport Fish Guide.... Watching someone eat a steak is NOT the same... as you eating a steak if you get my drift.Yes, For a 6 pk..... 2 customers as I understand it unless you have a ""family unit"", if that is a proper interp.A lot more burden on the Capt. and deckhand. I have heard talk of a ""Co Vid cleaning fee"" for boats and lodging. I agree some people will realize the the inherent cost of operation (fuel etc) and be willing to up it a bit.What people should realize is the uniqueness of this opportunity. When is the last time you had a semi pvt. trip? Since I hate crowded boats.....21 Days till Red's in the Rez. river!!Best... BoatAk"
"I’m hoping lots of folks, that might not have otherwise chosen this kind of fishing opportunity, will do so now. Families especially! Very unique, cool experience, sadly the reason why, but we’re looking forward to doing, maybe, some stuff we might not have otherwise! Thank you for the information, boat. Yay for reds! Deb"
I like less people when I’m trying to do something.E.g. - bought 6 people charter for 4 of us- always do a private guide on the M.Glacier
"LOVE less people on a charter, but... 6 pack X 350/pp = 2100. with 2 on the boat that jumps to 1050/PP?? I don't think many charters will sell that trip! Even with 4 on board it's over 500/pp...That just doesn't seem doable, and If that's the way it is I'm afraid it's gonna be a lean year for charters and guides. And item II...not sharing/passing rods between crew and clients? I just don't see that happening...or if it does, a lot of messed up lines and lost fish!Kinda makes me glad it's not a trip year for me, but still sad..."
