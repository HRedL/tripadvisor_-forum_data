What a great place. It's been HOT annd mainly suunny so far. Just arrived yesterday.must apologize about double letters in messagge - don't know why it's doing this! no time to fix.Questions? i'll check back a few times every day.freezing1
Had a little snag getting iinternett inn room - not woorking yesterday. Manuel came to fix it for me - Yay Manuel! Front desk people not overly friendly.Excellent sirlion steak at Rodeo grill last night.
Enjoy your time there freezing! Have a Cuba Libre with mucho Brugal Extra Viejo for me.-BrugalEdited: 10 years ago 
Glad to hear you are enjoying it - how do you like the food? Curious - after all the posts on it I can't wait to hear your feedback as we really enjoyed it.
Glad to hear the weather has improved..............have a great trip.
There seems to be post after post on the front desk staff. You would think the hotel would do something about it.
Please say hello to Annmarie of guest services for me! Tell her we are looking foward to our return trip in May!How is the food?
"Sorry I missed you at the airport yeasterday...your flight arrived very early!!!Just a question on the front desk staff...what is it that is not up to the standard one would expect??? Most staff at any resort I visit seem to be courteous and polite, Majestic included.CheersPCMike"
Oh...Brugal Extra Viejo....bet they don't have that at IFA. Fiddlesticks!Majestic is beautiful...enjoy!
"Thank you Brugal! I plan on having a great time! I got a compplimentary bottle of brugal in my room, so what could make this bad, right?"
"Cairo - thanks! I rely heavily on your opinion s your comment meaans a lot.the food is good in thhe a la carte so far -- the buffet is average =- to be expected - not really great, but you won't starve. i think if you're going to fed a few thoousand peole daay 3+ mealss,then you can't expect 5 star food.I am on my way to buffet for dinner nw so will let you know.freezing"
Steve - Annemarie s on holdays this week. I wish she were here - I would love too meet her.She is a great asset to this resort - she is the example of amazing customer service!freezing
thanks bob! yees - the weather is GREAT - sunny and VERY HOT - i have a great tan already and have only been here 1.5 days!freezing
I guess Annmarie deserves time off just like the rest of us! Thanks for checking and enjoy your time in paradise!!
Enjoy the beautiful weather. I just got back last night and am in withdrawal already :-(
"You mentioned that you had a problem with your in-room internet.......we are planning on bringing our netbook and a long ethernet cable from home. Is there anything else you would recommend to make the in-room computer experience run smoothly? Was it easy to ""pay"" for the service at the front desk? Does your laptop fit comfortably in the safe? Thanks for your reports!"
"PCMike - Hopefully i see you in the morning here at MC.As for the front desk, they're not so much rude as they are indifferent. they tell you ""just a minute"" but then aren't actually taking care of you/your request. I had to phone the front desk 4 times this morning to have my internet connection fixed. Each time they wee willng to help, but didn't actually doo anything at all. the same thing happened to me today at the spa. After I asked one of the ladies a question, she sad ""just a minute,""and then did nothing. Aboout 5 mins later, another woman came in and asked f she could help me. I looked at the fist woman assuming she would repeat my query, but said nothing. It was like I hadn't asked in the first place. Strange. Not awful, just strange.?? the internet seems to work well now, so thank you to Manuel who took care of it.:) freezing"
OG - yes - that's the stuff! There was also a complimentary bottle of Johnny Walker Red. Interesting choice.:) freezing
"Jerseymouse - my netbook fits easily in the room safe ( think iit's a 10""). The only thing I recommend is, if it's not working right away, it is likely a problem with their wiring or something. I tried and tried to ""fix"" the problem myself on my computer, but it turns out the problem was theirs. So -don't be afraid to call for help - ask for Manuel f you can. He was friendly and efficient. The process to set it up initially was easy - just let them know at the front desk that you want internet in your room - it's $10 a day - pay at checkout. I brought my own short cable but you can rent one from them if you need to.freezing"
"Cairo - I understand how that could happen (withdrawal).I had my hair braided this morning at the spa. In this humidity, I can't do a thing with my hair. Morrocan Oil doesn't even seem to be working. The braids should help. Breakfast at buffet was great - yummy homemade donuts and fritter-type things! Good sausage, fun coffee-boys.:) freezing"
"The coffee boys are fun. I remember there was one that would go into this whole ""song & dance"" that he was part chinese. He would really wake us up in the morning with his routine, even before we drank the coffee!How's the weather today?"
Gald you having a great trip! We are off the MC in June and cant wait. Can you get local Champagne at the restutants included in the AI package?Cat.
"Steve - the weather here today is hot again - mainly sunny, but some cloud. Still able to get a tan :)freezing"
"Cat - yes, the local champagne is everywhere including the morning buffet. It's right beside the orange juice dispensers. Everyone in my group also had a bottle of champagne in our rooms upon arrival. Some rooms aren't upgraded, so I would assume everyone gets one. It's not half bad, as is the house red wine - the white wine on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired :-)freezing"
Thanks.Think i may give it a miss at breakfast!.....Just happy to hear i can have a glass or 2 with my evening meal.How are you finding the resturants and are they easy to get booked up??Cat
"cAT - only 2 require reservations, but because I am wwith a large group, we booked all a la cartes befoore we left Canada (about a week ahead) so I'm not sure if they're easy to get into or not. Last night we ate at the buffet and I have to say it waasn't very busy. I did notice that thhe a a cartes seem quite busy so people must be gettiing iin to them.Tonight my group ate at the Japanese (we started as a group of 20, but only 12 of us were well enough to eat tonight. (Yup - we've been dropping like flies - vomiting and diarrhea). It was FANTASTIC! We had such a great time and the ffood was GREAT! I recommend the Japanese show-cooking ttables.4.5 days to go.freezing"
Hey freezing. Glad you loved the Japanese show table. Not so great about people in your group being sick!! What's up with that? Hope you get spared. Keep having a great time!! Did you have any Extra Viejo yet?-Brugal
Wow..sorry to hear about those that got sick. Almost half of you group is sick?!?! After how many days?
"I hope I am spared too! So far so good. We've been here since Sunday - not very long, so I wonder if ""it"" was floating around on the plane (?). All but 6 of us in the group of 20 have been sick - It seems to last about 12-18 hours average. It is clearly viral - there is no food connection and everyone seems to be getting sick at different times. I'm not a doctor,, though, so don't anyone jump on me for making that claim. In no way do any of us think it is due to the food. It's also not wrecking any of our holiday, it's just a little inconvenience. There are a bunch of troopers in the group for sure. I'll keep you posted."
"Brugal - I have had a small bit of the Brugal. I'm not much of a hard-alcohol drinker, but I must say, it's not too bad! What's the best way to drink it (with what?) Thanks!freezing"
"By the way - before anyone panics - I have NOT heard about anyone else around the resort being sick. This does not appear to be to be an epidemic (or pandemic, or whatever you call it) or anything. :) freezing"
"Good news on the illness not being food related or widespread. Also glad you've avoided it!I like Cuba Libres, Brugal Extra Viejo and Coke (diet) with lime during the day and straight with a few ice cubes at night. Enjoy!! :-)-Brugal"
To hit that many people so soon in the trip it does sound like a GI virus. Hope your group gets back on their feet soon! Can't miss that sunshine and the beach!!
"Thanks for taking time out of your holiday to post! Hope you dont get sick aswell, and the others are well soon.Enjoy!Cat."
"With regards to men having to wear shoes in some of the resturants, how strict are they with this rule, Hubby never takes shoes to wear in the evening, only leather smart sandals (birkenstock's), the only ""shoes"" he will take will be his sports shoes for the gym. It does make me laugh, i understand a dress code but shoes on holiday?????in the Carabiean????.......CRAZY!Cat."
I just don't get the reviews for this resort. Latest review states bar staff are rude and unemployable unless you are a Canadian guest and also states major issues between management and staff.Other reviews state bar staff are great. Baffling.
"I can't wait to test out how friendly and helpful the staff is when I'm there next week. I will certainly meet them all with a grateful and happy smile, and report back to TA on my return."
Yvonnebh: We are going back for our second trip in May so please report back on how you find the staff!Hey freezing1...how are you finding the staff? Is there fighting amoung the maids as reported in the recent review? Bar staff rudeness??How was the beach today?
"Cat - i'll checkk out the men's shoes - I know 1 male in our party wore leather sandals with long pants to the Rodeo Grill and no one said anything - i'll have to ask about last night at the Japanese - I didn't take notice of what they were wearing.Steve - I find the staff in general to be hit and miss - although no one is outright rude, they are either friendly or indifferent - some seem almost like they're ignoring you, others are quite friendly. I have found this to be true of some other resortts in both Mexico and Cuba. As for staff fighting - noot that I have witnessed. Today is mainly overcast so far but still hot. The cloud cover is quite thin, so it still feels quite sunny. A greaat morning to get a suunburn if you're not careful! It may be more sunnyy laterr today.This morning I had a wonderful deep-tissue massage at the Spa by Maria. It felt great - I am knot-free for now :) Tomoorrow I have booked an 80 minute seaweed wrap. I hope I don't come out of there smelling like a tuna! :Dfreezing - 4 days to go"
"Also - with the exceptionn of ann 11 year old boy, the groupp of 20 are all feeling better. 2 report to be feeling aboutt 80%, the rest are back to normal. A couple on the beach this morning report to have been sick yesterday as well, but that's all I have heard so far."
"HI Freezing... glad you liked your massage with Maria. I plan to get one next week when we're there, and will ask for her. Do you mind telling me how much you paid for the massage, and how long it was?"
if you get sick.. double the cuba libre intake.. should cure everything.. I make sure to get on a hourly dosage of it as soon as i get to the resort :)
"Thanks for the advice, trikkdaddy! I'll give it a 'shot', so-to-speak. :)Yvonne - I paid $55 for 25 minutes. I am looking in the spa's pamphlet: deep muscular 55 mins 95.00it looks like the least expensive 25 min massage is $50 and the most expensive 55 min massage is $100 (shiatsuu massage). the others are close to those prices.I have the wwhole pamphlet if you have any other questions.Off to bbuffet aand a little shopping tonight.freezing"
Have fun!Isn't the Beach Party Wed night? (tonight?)
I guess not! I see no sign of a beach party and it's 6:00 p. Wonder if they doon't do them any more or if it's a diifferent night? I'll try o find out.freezing
Bummer!That was one of the reason we are going back since it was cancelled last year because of a thunderstorm! Maybe it's another day now???
Isn't the beach party combined over in front of Elegance now? It was when we were there in November.-Brugal
"Oh no! I hope you're not right, Brugal. I didn't walk over to the Elegance to see. I'll see what I an find out tomorrow.Cat - the only a a cartes they are sticky on for closed-toe shoes for men are the Gourmet and the Japanese (tthe only 2 requiring reservations) This is according to the men i my group as well as a few random others,Buffet tonight - I have to say that my group received th BEST service at any restaurant here so far. Someone named ""Rafael"" seemed to be overseeing the service staff in the area we were eating and we received VERY attentive and friendly service tonight in the buffet. The food was all good - excellent beef, freshly made pasta and delicious fried banana were on my plate tonight. Yummy! There's always something to eat - even for the picky teenagers we have in our group. All 20 people (including me) are feeling fine, by the way. :)I'll check back in tomorrow.freezing"
"i m from winnipeg and heading to majestic colonial at end of month....any golf info for me from Punta Blanco and Rico Ki ? Also, any info on Macao Surf Camp ? Is the food good there and what what are good location rooms to request ? Lots of bottled water available ? Are room fridges stocked with beer daily ? Any other good info you have is appreciated.steve"
"Thanks for taken time from your holiday to post. We are going as a group in May to the Elegance. Looking forward to seeing both hotels and enjoying those hot, sunny days! Enjoy your vacation."
Hey....good news.... today the sun has come out in Jersey and it hit 70 degrees. Getting me in the mood for our May trip to Punta Cana.Hows the weather down there today?Any update on the weekly beach party???
My husband I will be arriving there tomorrow....prob around 1pm! Thanx so much for your posts. We are very excited. We have booked a swim up room and I emailed them last week asking to be as close as possible to the beach. Fingers crossed they come through for me.Hope to run into you....maybe I can buy you a drink at the pool bar?
"question for ya......if i wanna go snorkeling, are masks, fins and snorkels provided. I can bring my own snorkels, but is getting fins and masks a hassle? I have heard it is a free servbice at majestci....care to elaborate on that ??..................BTW, how long are u down there for ?"
"Hi, first time ever posting; but wanted to know how is the nightlife?"
"SMDECH - I am sorry, I d not have any info on Punta Blanca,RicoKi, or the Macao Surf Camp.Is the food good? Well, I and the other 19 people iin my party can alwways find something to eat - we are not starving.Your room request depends on your preference. I think building 2 is in the best location personally. Rooms in this building around 2130-2145ish are near the pool bar and afternoon entertainment area so are not very peaceful all the time. The rooms in buildings 3 and 4 would provide the most quiet, I would imagine.There is plenty oof bottled water available - in your room, and at the bars - I usually take a few bottles to the beach and get them right at the beach bar.Your room fridge will be stocked with 2 Presidente beer, 4 water, and 4 soft drinks.freezing"
"Steve -- very hot and partly sunny here again today. Wind picked up a little, so playing in the ocean waves was a blast!No news on the beach party yet - I'll try to find someone who speaks better english tonight and ask them. I sure hope I didn't miss it.freezing"
Karen - that would be great! My room is near the pool bar - just on the other side of the bridge.freezing
"smdech - You can get masks and snorkels at the aquatic centre. I brought my own (my mask has prescription lenses) I am not sure if it's a hassle or not. I haven't seen very many people with snorkel gear, so that could mean there's plenty to be had. (?) There's not a whole lot too see - there were a few fish around today but not much else to see. I leave here on Sunday.freezing"
"Relax - I do not take in any more night life than the occasional evening show, but others in my group goo to the casino or to the disco after the show. Night life seems okay for an AI resort.freezing"
Hey....how's your day going?
"Hey Steve!The day has been great! A little cloudy today, but still hot, with plenty of glimpses of the sun. Wind picked up today, sso we spent most of the day having great fun with the ocean waves.I checked at guestt services about the beach pparty - theyy telll me that the beach party is still on Wednesday nights - no one I talked to saw it here on Wed., but who knows for sure. It was St. Pat's day so mmaybe they just didn't have it this week. ???Some of took a water taxii to the market down the beach by the Ocean Blue/Sand. Very aggressive vendors! Most of us ended up buying a painting. The market didn't see very busy. I see you can get hair braiding there, as well as at the market just outside of the Majestics. I enjoyed my sirloin so much thee other night, I plan to go to the Steak House again tonight for dinner.Sorry - I see I am still double- and triple-lettering. Mustt have droppedd my laptopp or something.1 full day to go.freezing"
Thanks for checking on the Beach Pary day. We missed it last year and hope to attend this time!Thanks also for posting all week. I felt like I had a little Punta Cana vacation myself by reading your posts all week! Enjoy the rest of your stay and have a safe trip back. I'll keep a look out for your review when you return and please upload some pictures to TA too!If you haven't had one yet go to the lower lobby bar and have a Mojito on me. They make the best on the island!
"i am hoping to come there in june but i was a bit worried about some of the reviews about luke warm food ,damp rooms and people being sick,how are you finding it,also i was debating going to the dreams la romana instead have you been there and what is your recomondation."
