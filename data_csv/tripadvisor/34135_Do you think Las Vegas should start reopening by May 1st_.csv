"At today's press briefing, Trump strongly implied that around 20 states may be ready to reopen by this May 1st. Do you think the state of Nevada should be one of these?"
No. I don’t.
Definitely Not....
Nevada is not among the 20 lowest cases when broken down by State. Only Hawaii among the lowest 20 seems to be a big tourism draw.Nevada is ranked 24 on the list of fewest cases.I am guessing we are out of the game until at least May 15 (assuming a plan to get back to normalcy actually happens starting on May 1).
Nope
"I think Las Vegas will be one of the last places to open. How many other places in the world have the large crowds in small areas, where maintaining anything approaching social distance guidelines, or individual testing is a virtual impossibility. Not to mention that for Las Vegas to come any where near a full comeback would require visitors from all over the country, but also from all over then entire world almost. Ain't gonna happen any time soon."
"Definitely notEdited: 7:20 pm, April 14, 2020 "
Well there are a handful of posters here who will be first in line if May 1 gets the all clear ....
2 weeks from now.... I don’t think that’s possible and if they did open they would lose money
"No, I don’t think it’ll be ready until late Summer/early Fall. 13Edited: 7:30 pm, April 14, 2020 "
"The reality of it is that it doesn’t matter what we think. It matters what the President, Governor, Mayor, and major business executives think. They will open we it is most economically feasible. Too early will cost everyone, too late will cost. It is in the best interest to get it open as soon as feasible. May 1, might be a stretch but possible. I think it will start on a smaller scale."

"Someone reported that Nevada was being economically harmed by the COVID-19 outbreak, second only to Maine.I think from May 1st, hotel/casino staff will start to be re-employed for opening to the public on May 15th."
"Absolutely YES, you don’t have to go. Customers have a choice not to go. It is not about profit or stock prices or rich people. They need to get the working class back to work immediately, they need the money. There are 100 ways to make it safe."
"They can open whenever they want. It doesn't mean anyone will come. Two weeks from now how many people will want to fly on an airplane to get there? You do realize that just because the President, Governor, or other officials say ""It's OK to open Now"" doesn't mean that they will. It also may be the case that they are losing less money by having everything shut down, than they would be by having all the expenses of operating for a limited number of guests. IMO no matter what officials may say, it won't happen that soon."
">>Do you think the state of Nevada should be one of these?<<I feel like this question has been asked before, once or twice or twenty times?Id guess that the state of NV will open in phases like most other states. NV has 2 metropolitan areas and a bunch of small rural towns. The rural areas will more than likely open differently than the populous areas. Id guess that he Metro LV area will open in phases where some businesses will be considered essential before others. As important as having the casinos back to normal is to the state, there is no way it happens all at once. Large gatherings probably arent going to happen for several months at the very earliest."
"The President really has no control over when States reopen. He may try to assert influence but in actuality the Governor's are in charge as per the Constitution. See below.https:/…Edited: 8:01 pm, April 14, 2020 "
"Big daddy , making this political? There are other tools available to the President. Like any legal question it can all be interpreted differently. The constitution isn’t an all encompassing document, there are exceptions."
"Does'nt much matter when Vegas opens because whether its in May or November,there will probably still not be a vaccine. And if there were a vaccine,it probably would'nt be 100% effective. And yes,when people go back to work,there will be another surge of illness. Until the USA has herd immunity,like CA. seems to have,people will continue to become ill from this virus. And as a poster mentioned above,I will go when my scheduled trip of July 10th comes around. Hopefully,when enough people are tested,this virus will have a mortality rate similar to an influenza rate. Cant stay holed up forever."
"“ Until the USA has herd immunity,like CA. seems to have,”No, California does not have “ herd immunity “."
"Even if open by May 1 st, who can actually get there? Locals, those that can drive within a few hours? Zero tourists from overseas, few, if any from the east coast or from any place where a flight of a few hours is needed...."
"This is a National Emergency. There are excess powers that a given to the POTUS. So was he wrong, you can make a case either way? It will be legally interpreted but that takes time. In the meantime his quote of “Total” power may have been strong, but not necessarily wrong."
So here’s another question since many think that a vaccine is the most critical thing. What do we do with the anti vaccers?
“ What do we do with the anti vaccers?”Nothing. I guess they take their chances.
"Yes, it will be Southern Californians and locals initially since we don’t have to drive. I doubt I’ll be on the first waive, even though I am jonesing to go to Vegas. I do think I’ll wait a little bit. Hoping realistically for July.Edited: 8:42 pm, April 14, 2020 "
No way!
"IrishFan #19,I think that Silicon Valley has “nerd immunity... “Hunt"

Jared Kushner is the smartest man in America. Should he be elected for anything? No. But he will.
"No. I think we should wait until all contagious diseases and illnesses are cured. Until then, we should all just stay at home. The government's gonna send us $1,200, so it's all good, right? Too bad we don't have rights and freedoms anymore."
We got our $2400 today. We will not spend it jn Las Vegas. It might be cheaper to keep the strip closed than to open it at 10 0r 20 percent of capacity like Macau has done.
So many people. Don't think it is a good idea. Open NY 1st.

"If they were to open here May 1 (they won’t) it would be me, Gary, and Mike from the forum. Nobody will be in town that early."

"Genuine question, until a vaccine is available (18 months away, maybe?), what is the difference between opening up May 1st or October 1st? We have to open eventually, which will lead to a spike in cases. Is mass testing the best answer?"
"CO, why are you so obsessed with the leader of another country? Just wondering because you rip on him almost more than Qdog does, but at least he has a dog in the fight.13"
I think country wide things HAVE to start opening. Although Covid is serious we can’t keep purposely destroying the economy. We are going to have more problems if things don’t start opening. So I hope starting May 1st throughout the country things start opening.
"“ purposely destroying the economy. ”Perspective I guess, but I like to think of it as purposely saving lives. 13"
"The Strip would be in the same situation for reopening as with cruiseships, sports leagues, Disneyworld, Disneyland. That 4 mile strip doesn't lend itself to social distancing...not much difference than a cruiseship. It's too bad. It's gonna to be a long time. This will test one's perseverance."
The President does have the power. but he won't use it as he has said he will be working with the governors and they will make the decision. I got my stimulus(care act) money with no presidents name on it. I don't care whose name is on it as long as it doesn't bounce. I also own a small business and we need more funding but one group of people won't give money to the working class unless they get in stupid stuff. like the Kennedy center. the dud green new deal and also all sorts of junk that has nothing to do with coronavirus. I think we all know who those people are. June 1 I believe Las Vegas strip will open.
Not a hope Next May isn't a given either
"@John S, Next May? Lol. How much are you willing to wager on that? You can pay me on your future visit. Do you really think some semblance of Las Vegas will not be open for another full hear? A new billion dollar football stadium in nearly finished. There is no way the Strip remains closed that long. Follow the money, not morality.Edited: 1:07 pm, April 15, 2020 "
Las Vegas will open by Memorial Day. Any earlier would be a mistake in my opinion.
"Trump also said by Easter and we all see how that worked out. May 1 is in 2 weeks. There's no way they open by then. I think a full 2 week run up will be needed to reopen, think of everything that will need to be prepped."
"No it won't, imo."
"Are the lights on....anyone know if the last laid off employee shut them off ?Edited: 1:43 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Yes, but it won't because too many at-risk people and/or those who may come in contact with them will travel even though they're not supposed to. Those people, a minority who are incapable of showing a modicum of personal responsibility, dictate the lives of the majority. Sad, but necessary."
"At-risk people (and the people who take care of them) should stay home. Everyone else should be able to work and move freely. We can't cripple our economy and put tens of millions of people out of work.This was originally supposed to be for a couple of weeks to flatten the curve. Then it was a month. Then, just a couple more weeks. Now, there are people talking about 2021 or beyond, or ""when we get a vaccine."" The concern was that our hospitals would be overfilled. That just isn't the case in the majority of places in this country. Many hospitals are shutting down because they're so empty. Even people in the medical profession are being laid off. It's unimaginable what is being done to our economy, not to mention the total loss of our freedom.Protesters in North Carolina were told that protesting is a non-essential activity yesterday. I guess our constitutional rights are null and void because some people are sick? There are 400 COVID19 hospitalizations in NC, out of a population of 10.5 million."

No unfortunately not
"DTC - I mentioned hospitalizations because I thought that was the whole point of shutdowns...to ""flatten the curve"" and avoid overtaxing the healthcare system."
Right now. Full power.
I believe the vaccine will determine everything in the end. There's a lot of people out there thinking that there hasn't been as many deaths as originally expected. But for some reason they can't put two and two together and realise it might have something to do with most people staying at home and not out there mixing with others!To get things going again we need to know we are protected from the disease and probably more importantly we need to know if we've already had the disease and have the antibodies to fight it.
"""There's a lot of people out there thinking that there hasn't been as many deaths as originally expected. But for some reason they can't put two and two together and realise it might have something to do with most people staying at home and not out there mixing with others!""The IHME models took ""full social distancing through May 2020"" into account and were still grossly exaggerated. Like by 3-5 times or more."
"I wouldn't have too much reliance on antibody testing. There's evidence of re-infection, and the virus has been mutating.Business should be resumed from a reset position. High standards of hygiene and personal discipline initially, and see how that results in cases of infection. Work it like a feedback loop - relax the standards until the virus starts to become a significant health issue."
You could argue that social distancing is giving much better results than first thought!Is there an estimate for the numbers if we just let everyone get back to normal?
"Who cares when Vegas opens up? Only a few would show up. It would look more like Tunica on a Tuesday than the Vegas we know. Cheaper to stay shut down than open with at 20% or less occupancy. We will be traveling again when there is an effective vaccine, an easy cure or the disease has run it's course."
"Chivas is 100% correct, numbers are lower because of stay home edict ...without it, numbers would soar...simple mathEdited: 8:24 am, April 17, 2020 "
It’s only realistic to put 3000 people into one hotel if there was a vaccine or a way to test everyone in and out. I just don’t see it quite yet.
Rallen2018What you are saying makes the case for either opening now or staying closed forever. If any antibodies developed only last for weeks then a vaccine will be ineffective. So I take your point as a vote for open now without restrictions.
no
Put it this way.If you jump out of an aeroplane you're falling very fast. You then pull your parachute and it slows you right down. Should you then take off your parachute before you get to the ground?
"“Cheaper to stay shut down than open with at 20% or less occupancy.“There are going to be some low percentages at whatever point they open up. I’d agree that they should be in the latter half of things reopening so the brave could travel here if they wanted.The employees for the most part want to return now. The casinos of course will be factoring in money, as they should."
"@Steve M (Post #75) - ""So I take your point as a vote for open now without restrictions.""Open now, but limit the possibilty of transmitting the virus with hygiene measures and social distancing.I'm subject to lockdown, but I have been using public transport and practising social distancing in getting food supplies. There are no public restrooms open where I live, to wash my hands.A Las Vegas hotel/casino could improve on the conditions that I now face in my officially locked down state."
If you are insinuating that antibodies may not have lasting effect. Then a vaccine will not be effective. Not will herd immunity. So social distance to what end and for how long?
"@Steve M (Post #80) - ""So social distance to what end and for how long?""IMHO, social distancing will be the norm for some time, to avoid exposure to the virus. I don't get that a vaccine will not be effective, but most people's immune systems should cope.There is a view that SARS-CoV-2 is a man-made virus and will eventually disappear.https://www.zerohedge.com/health/covid-19-ma…Quote: ""Nature does not accept any molecular tinkering, it will eliminate these unnatural changes and even if nothing is done, things will get better, but unfortunately after many deaths."""
Nope! Too much international and domestic travel into Vegas unlike Atlantic City which is more regional but I don’t see AC opening any time soon either.
"Nearly a month later, he continued to claim to reporters that the coronavirus would simply vanish by April: “One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”"
No ... not at all
"AC is very regional unlike LV. I was trying to include it in our next NYC trip before the pandemic, not easy to get to."
"AC is a fine destination...Not Vegas...But if you stay at a place like Borgata, fine din8ng, good gambling, no reason to leave..though I recommend lunch at Whitehouse subs,a short cab / Uber ride away"
"@2saltydawgs (Post #87) - I never trust to one source of news, and that includes Zero Hedge. I have found them ahead of the MSM in reporting e.g. I recall Zero Hedge had a twitter account closed because they reported the conspiracy theory that SARS-CoV- 2 was man-made and originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. What does the MSM report now? The US is investigating this very point, which was conspiracy theory previously."

South Point unlikely any time soon.https:/…
"Speaking of Atlantic City, I plan on going there when things start to reopen. I live an hour away and it will give me a sense of normalcy. I don't plan on going to Vegas anytime soon, I really don't want to take a plane at this time."
"So Southpointe is furloughing all its employees as of a May 3, for an indefinite time..And Wynn is planning to slowly reopen 12 days later...something doesn’t add up"
If it opens back up then how many tourists does Vegas usually get from other countries to be able to operate well with all the rooms they have?
No! And it shouldn't
"I have flight and room reservations from May 3rd for 4 days. I sure as hell hope they open up. I'm staying down town though, not on the strip."
Agreed
"Even if the casinos are opening we are talking not all employees will be working. If occupancy initially is 10-20%, do you think more than 25% of the work force will be back. So Southpoint is furloughing employees really doesn’t have that drastic effect on the opening. Even though a locals casino, they are dependent on conventions. So even if open, still they will have tons of unemployed..."
"A lot of employees are going to be out of work for a long time. Based on Twitter rumors, ""the big ones"" are only planning on opening up a couple of Strip properties in the beginning. I read that MGM is going to start with MGM Grand and Bellagio first. The hotels probably won't be opening all of their towers or their restaurants, bars, shops, etc. in the beginning.It will likely be a long time before all employees are needed."
"I heard Excalibur and Bellagio first. But who really knows, things are changing so quickly."
I don’t think anything is changing quickly.
Things were changing quickly last month. Things are at a standstill right now.
"lin-duh is making a lot of sense and is able to be realistic. we are at an impasse at least until the experts can really integrate the social distancing mandate into a feasible plan. It's evident to me that opening of any or all casinos will be way after other business' are reopened.....Vegas w/out casinos is doomed for failure.Edited: 7:44 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"just saw this recent article albeit it was published several weeks ago,sorry was unable to cut and paste entire lengthy article: The CDC this month recommended that ALL Americans wearing non-surgical face masks in public, and it’s especially important to wear in places that social distancing is hard to maintain.“There is no virtual wall at this 3- to 6-feet distance,” says Lydia Bourouiba, the study’s author, who specializes in fluid dynamics and is an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
