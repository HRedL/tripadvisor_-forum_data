"Me and my husband staying in junior suite (3 weeks today) for our 25th annioversary, could not afford to upgrade, but not really bothered as will not spend much time in room only to sleep. I am going to email them to see if I could still book a good room anyone advise me before I do this as to what no. room has a good view or position. Many thanks. "
"I can't recommend a room, but here is a map of the RPDC...When they are running at near full occupancy, it may be hard to pick and choose a room..Good Luck..robino.info/Atlantis/royal_pdc_map_2008.pdf"
"I've stayed here before and you really do not have to upgrade in my opinion. The only difference is you get to try the Chef's Restaurant, you get a pillow menu, robes and a place for your ipod. Little perks like that. realresorts.com/The_Royal_Playa_Carmen/â€¦ You can check it out here. But if you're only in there to sleep, doesn't really matter. They still provide really good service no matter what room you're in. You're going to love this place! "
"We just got back from RPDC. We had a Junior suite, and we did not miss the Royal Service at all. We had rooms 167 and 168, and were very happy with them. Our rooms overlooked the center courtyard area (between the pool and the lobby)."
"Thanks for all your replies, I now worried of course we might not even be going with this flu epidemic, lets hope it will be ok in 3 weeks time."
