"Clearly the current situation is dire with the UK an estimated 3 weeks behind Italy and Turkey an estimated 3 weeks behind the UK. Italy appears to be reaching the peak now but with draconian isolation/quarantine laws and practices, not quite yet seen in the UK, nor in Turkey. All the current social-distancing measures are merely to flatten the peak, i.e delay it so that health services can cope, so instead of a normal 12-week pandemic it will go on as long as it takes. The chances are 80-90% of the global population will get infected with Corbid-19 but the measures are there so that it is 'not yet'. The mortality rate is currently estimated at around 1% of cases but without proper, randomised testing of the whole population, there is little statistical evidence to back this figure up. It is likely to be far lower as the evidence is based on those who are tested - and testing has been focussed on the ill. I think I have had the virus. I had mild symptoms which I did not recognise until they were all put together in retrospect. But I don't know. There is no test yet available and there is no means of self-reporting for those falling ill. The advice is not to report, just self-isolate. I completed my two weeks yesterday. On the balance of things known and unknown - when do you believe travel restrictions to Turkey will be relaxed? My best guess is Turkey will want to be ready for Summer 2021. Trump wants everyone to return to work and fill the churches for Easter 2020. Thoughts?"
"Thanks Doctor Tim.I'd be surprised if holidays to Turkey from Western Europe were easily achievable before end of summer.I've got travel booked in April, June and end of July. I've mentally written off the first two, and am only about 50/50 for the late July travel.Being pragmatic, I suspect 2020 is a write off."
"We've got Turkey booked for 18th June, and have just about given that one up ! We are hoping for September, but not too hopeful, so are really planning for June and Sept 2021 crateegg"
I suggest everyone's busy trying to stay sane Tim.How's your Mum?
"Andy B, Mother & I should have been in Venice now and are booked to visit my little house in Greece early May - which won't happen. She is doing all the right things in that she is spending an inordinate amount of time on the phone to friends and her sister and watching all her favourite TV & films. I about to start cooking her favourite dish of mine today - a curry from first principles. We have invited some friends to join us in Side in October on the basis that it may be cancelled but, if so, there will be nothing lost, and if it does go ahead, we will certainly appreciate the break by then. Curry awaits...."
"Hmmm... My holiday is booked in mid August, booked airline and hotel direct and paid in full. So I'm just sitting tight and seeing what happens. My hope is that we still go, but I'm beginning to think it won't happen now, so the best outcome might be that the hotel in question moves my booking to 2021. Airlines are offering free amendments so that should be ok!Comments on my situation most welcomed!"
"There was minor good news this morning in that the rate of increase of UK Covid-19 hospital admissions appears to have slowed suggesting the lock-down is working. It is also a good time to book :-) Nobody is booking at the moment, flight fares are at their lowest and if cancelled, theoretically, there will be a full refund - either from the airline if it is still solvent or from ATOL/the Government. I rate the chances of our October escape to Side have increased to around 60/40. I am still the only person I know locally who may have had Covid-19. So all is well, for now, in Slaithwaite. A couple of months to go, I suspect."
"Tim, I'm afraid that a one-day decline in new cases doesn't give me too much hope. We need that trend to last for a week at least before getting our hopes up."
"Tim,What colour is the sky in your world?LOL."
"I would certainly not book a holiday at the moment, prices are high and WHEN we are allowed to travel again I am certain prices will be a lot lowerEdited: 6:20 am, March 30, 2020 "

"In my world, it has clouded over after a freakish run of two dry and sunny weeks. We don't get that in Yorkshire at the best of times. It is the horizon we must focus upon and especially the event horizon. There it is sunny, warm and the hospitality even more welcoming."
"It’s great you are being so positive Tim, seriously l mean that, l wish l could live in the world you inhabit, because from listening to the experts over the past couple of days things will get much worse before they get better. We have been warned the present way we are having to live is very likely to last for another few months yet.So it’s not a case of making plans, just taking it day by day, and sad as it is, forgetting holidays as far as the rest of 2020 goes. This is the reality, and l am beyond gutted, as is everyone else on here, all who love. Turkey just as much as l do."
"Josephine, Yes and no. Obviously things are dire now and set to get worse in the next couple of weeks. The blue horizon is a distraction activity to focus on positive things. I usually hibernate in the summer - Yorkshire is the best place on Earth to be - but October onwards is my main concern - 'The Season' as those in the know call it. The doctor on BBC R4 Broadcasting House yesterday said that his mentor advised him to tell patients who will certainly die, ""Things will get worse before they get better"". And we have exactly the same advice from the Prime Minister.I have my packing list formulated for the Side Su in October. If I can be, I will be there."
"Let’s hope that dream comes true anyway... we all need a holiday now though it’s questionable if Turkey will ever be the the same again after this, it would be heartbreaking but highly likely. Agree about Yorkshire the countryside and dales, etc are very beautiful."
"I'm still hoping for an October break but I wouldn't put the chances above 30%.We are fortunate that we hadn't booked our usual May break. The rocketing costs of flights, hotels and drinks meant that we were looking elsewhere. If Turkey finds that its tourist industry is suffering after the end of restrictions then it might not only be Covid 19 to blame."
"Albion, I think Turkey will be competitive for years to come, especially Antalya province, simply because private families have for years over-built hotels. They are playing a long game and do not mind making a loss for a few years. I lived in Side until 2004 when I returned to the UK. I thought it would be an opportunity to holiday in other countries. I have to an extent but I keep returning to Antalya simply because, like-for-like, there is no better value. There are very few international chain hotels in Antalya, I imagine because they can't turn an operating profit. I know hotels generate their income in the summer but I imagine they lose it all on the likes of me in the winter :-) This year the owners will need deep pockets. If the staff are not retained, the best will use the opportunity to change hotels for a pay increase. I agree things may look very different when we return to Turkey. We should have an idea of how things will proceed in a couple of week's time - constant plateau for the foreseeable future or a plan to reduce restrictions gradually.Trump wants the churches packed by Easter. I can't see that happening. I remain optimistic about travelling in October but the hotel we booked, the Side Su, usually closes November-March. I can't see it opening just for October and if it does, it will not be operating at full strength."
"Oops, for accuracy, and it was too late to edit, I lived in Side 2004-2008."
"Regarding the staff at hotels, worth mentioning that they should be retained in almost all cases through the Turkish government's intervention a la Rishi Sunak. Small businesses may have over-reacted, but there's not much reason for the larger hotels to sack people in droves.The most remarkable thing about the current health crisis and presumed subsequent economic one is the lack of complaint from hoteliers."
"I am hoping that hotels which are usually open all-year will seize the opportunity of the enforced closure to do some serious renovations and upgrades. I am of course thinking of my beloved Sunrise Queen, which will be leaving the Crystal group, but also other hotels, some of which have not closed for a day since they opened. I just hope they keep feeding the cats."
Yes let’s hope they feed the cats. As regards doing up hotels being refurbished and work being done I can’t see it happening like everyone else in the rest of the world they will be trying to say money
"3-eagle, these wise, old, rich Turks who own hotels are playing a long game. With so much competition now, they would be foolish to rest on their laurels during an unexpected down period. I expect to see many upgrades that may not be priced in to their wholesale rates until 2022 . 2021 is already done. We shall see.Mat Hancock, Heath Secretary, said this morning that the UK is around three weeks away from the peak. Unfortunately, that is how it was two weeks ago. I wonder if we will always be three weeks away from the peak? I have reduced my odds on October in Side to 55/45. I have contacted the Hotel Side Su for their opinion, i.e. are they planning not to open again this year? There has been no reply as yet."
"Only my guess but I am sure most businesses in Turkey (and elsewhere for that) don't have a clue when they will be operating again. I find the mixed messages given by governments utterly ridiculous. In one it is claimed the tourist season will resume by the end of May........ https://www.dailysabah.com/business/tourism/…with international flights resuming at the beginning of June. However, as bongoali points out that this seems foolishly optimistic as global movement cannot be allowed until there is an effective vaccine and a decent antibody test."
"Yes on antibody test, in which I have a personal interest - I hope I have had the virus - the UK Health Secretary says they had 300 offers of testing regimes, narrowed it down to 15 candidates and all have so far failed. Clearly national governments with a huge interest in tourism and control over their media are going to play the figures down. As they are gradually exposed to full scrutiny, I hope it will be the political end of some of these. I was a scientist once. I am not encouraged by the global response to this crisis. The media gurus and would-be dictators appear to have the upper hand. The war is not against the virus but on truth. We may just win this time. There is hope.Edited: 7:10 am, April 03, 2020 "
Tim I may regret asking this but what is this ment to mean “I was a scientist once. I am not encouraged by the global response to this crisis. The media gurus and would-be dictators appear to have the upper hand. The war is not against the virus but on truth. We may just win this time. There is hope.“
"3-eagle, I meant merely that the reaction to the covid-19 crisis has so far been led by politicians in a non-too-transparent way. It is hard to get at the truth and all data is first being filtered and spun by their handlers. The first doctor to break the news in China, back in November, was arrested and charged with spreading public misinformation. He has since died of the disease, so we are told. Scientists have their method which involves neutrally presenting evidence backed up by verifiable sources, then peer-reviewed before being published. I know the peer-review process is forensic and brutal. Politicians on the other hand say what they want people to believe without any review process or test of truth. That is all I can see coming out of national governments at the moment. Ghandi said that the truth will win, in the end. In the meantime, it has the likes of Trump, Putin and Erdogan to contend with. Chiaro? Regrets?"
Tim thanks but I knew I should not have asked

No disrespect but your not stuck there. You chose to stay in turkey
"Another 3 weeks of lock-down in the UK will be announced tomorrow. That takes us to 7th May. The following 3 weeks should see some minor relaxation, according to the evidence coming from those countries, Italy & Spain, which made some relaxations starting today. That would take us to 28th May. If the anti-body tests come online, along with electronic 'certificates of health to travel', we may see some bilateral arrangements allowing some flights to resume. I can't see 'normality' returning until a vaccine is in place and whole populations of countries have been vaccinated. Then, I cannot see normality returning in quite the same way. Thoughts?"
Yes Tim I would agree per post #22
"Well Bongoali, I think it is it is quite something if you can agree with yourself. I rarely do."
"Complete disrespect here. She's not stuck anywhere. She chose to stay in Turkey (repeatedly), continues to do so, and has spent the past month endlessly bloviating complete nonsense here every day. I don't understand why their account has not been killed. It's just some weird combination of trolling and spam."
"Haha Tim.. I meant I expressed similar thoughts to you, around vaccine availability being the point of returning to before."
"Things are moving on. The Turkish Minister for Tourism (and owner of hotel chains) set out proposals to re-open hotels without buffets and not all-inclusive, that they should be operated as 'boutique hotels' at half capacity. See:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g297…The airlines are proposing all sorts of measures including keeping the middle seat free (on short haul 3-3 seating), Covid testing within 48 hours of travel or at the airport, etc.It feels that the lock-down damm won't hold until there is a vaccine widely available - experts are predicting in time for winter 2021/22. Ways around must be devised. Turkish hotels are meant to be re-opening by the end of May. When and how flights to Turkey re-start is pure conjecture and dependent upon many layers of practical measures and bureaucracy falling into place. My feeling is that airlines will pay for Covid testing at airports in order to resume flights and that will happen around 2 months from now. Airports may start to more resemble hospitals than the shopping centres they have become."

That person is just self-promoting. Report every post until gone.
Tried that Tim. Tried it!! I really do not understand the moderation as others have been banned for far less! Hey ho takes all sorts to make this world I guess.
"Vip, why are you not a moderator?"
For info and opening myself up to obvious criticism but I’ve took the gamble on the cheapest EasyJet flights end October and a £1 booking at the Delphin Be Grand via Sunshine. In 6 months time I’m hoping this is all a distant memory or at least some form of normality has resumed.
"Sm96, well done! We have to plan ahead if only because it is a positive mental-health activity. I am pleased Sunshine are running the £1 deposit promotion. I see that their T&C say that £1 is the extent of your exposure on hotel bookings until two weeks before - most booking sites with low initial deposits charge the 'full deposit' within a month and have cancellation/amendment fees. Sunshine do not. They also have some competitive rates which don't always appear on comparison sites. I am booked for Side in October and Antalya in January. Let's hope our trips come off!"
Spam spam spam spam spam...
Urmmm no you are the one repeating yourself to the point of spamming. All I’ve done is pass on UK government advice ......
"Vip, another one removed!Back to the topic...From https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-mul…""The second phase will observe a dynamic process and all the steps for the reopening will be calculated in line with the course of the spread of the virus in a bid to avoid a second wave of the pandemic. Sportive activities could also be resumed without spectators if the Science Board recommends. Wearing masks, following the rules of social distancing and protecting hygiene will become the new normal during the second phase. From September to end of 2020The third phase will begin as the summer ends on Aug. 31. More measures are believed to be lifted while the schools and universities would reopen in this period. Government offices will return to their normal routine and a travel ban within the country could be lifted in the event of a downfall in the pace of the spread of the virus. The fourth phase will begin in January 2021 and will last until a vaccine against the COVID-19 is developed.""This appears to imply that international travel (to/from Turkey) will not be permitted until at least January under current plans. Ryanair was the latest airline this morning to announce thousands of job cuts, joining Lufthansa, easyJet and BA among others. BA has said it may never resume its Gatwick operations and just retreat to Heathrow T5 shedding the higher paid (non 'mixed fleet') crew in the process. I am starting to look at Filey and Bridlington :-("

If only Turkish grammar were not difficult to master...."
There is a theme Tim....brain dead.
"Both Turkey and the UK are well over their peak death rates from Covid and on current trajectories they will be approaching the expected number of deaths from underlying causes in a couple of months, i.e. about the average based on past years.https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/…Business and governments everywhere are keen to get going again and the stream of proposals on how to do that before a vaccine has been made widely available are collectively looking quite oppressive - compulsory masks for hotel guests, no self-service coffee machines, condiments etc., regimented social distancing at reception, bars, buffets around the pool, the spas and gyms closed. I cannot see how guests will be allowed to use lifts, except one at a time - permanent long queues for them?Skiers are oft mocked for their white marks around their eyes where their goggles were worn. Perhaps the white Covid mouths and noses will be the new ridicule? If my flights for October and January to Antalya are not cancelled, I will be going. What to, is hard to imagine.Edited: 5:30 am, May 07, 2020 "
Finally somebody who thinks same as I do can’t put life on hold because of this. If things go to plan will be on that plane in august no worries. All this has done is make people neurotic
"There is no way many people are going to be safe distancing when on holiday. I was in a Tesco today and once people had passed the organised queuing system outside, it was ridiculous how they just started mixing it up as if there was no crisis.Imagine a large Turkish resort, especially with the added drama of Russians and other nationalities that are notorious for queue jumping and 'getting all up in your grill' as the youth would say.I'm as keen as the next person to get a holiday ASAP but I honestly cannot imagine it being fun at all with all the restrictions that are being speculated, and knowing that some/most people will be defying safe distancing altogether."
"I agree asif I can not see hotels being able to do social distancing hence why I do not believe all the plans for the hotel industry to open will be adhered to. Will there be a bit of difference from before yes but I doubt very much it will be massive differences.Hence why I would be quite happy to go late sept. What I will do is keep in contact with the people I know at hotels and ask them what is happing nearer the timeEdited: 9:23 am, May 07, 2020 "
"I'm glad that there are people finally using common sense with this sars s..tThere was recently - in last few days - research made by the SCIENTISTS in Poland... They claim that they found covid 19 antibodies in around 2 % of people in a big city (Krakow).1000 random people were tested, and the results extrapolated to the rest of the population of the city (which is around 1 mln). The best thing is, that ALL these 1000 people tested were chosen as ""having no symptoms"" of illness. So basically, some of them (2 %), they had the illness without even knowing about it.Now, if you take 2 % of 1 mln city, you have around 20 k people...The official ""infected"" government stats for the whole Poland are around 15k people as for now.Which is obviously not true...Later, when you check the deaths statistics (around 20 people die every day supposedly of covid 19. i bet that this kind of stats is much more accurate, as there always have to be a reason found why someone is dead...) in Poland, you have: 90 % of the people that died are over 70 years old and with ongoing illnesses...Seriously, is anyone surprised that person that is 92 years old can die? After contracting any bacterial infection or flu? These kind of people have to be very careful, thats the natural way of things...Same with the other group of people, with ongoing illnesses that make them weak...So all this hype was so much blow out of proportion. I will never forget about this.I will never forget about most of the mainstream mass media that helped to blow it. To make people scare...I will never forget how people can scare themselves with turning off rational thinking and turning emotions on...I will also never forget the governments, that almost succeeded in destroying middle class in many countries, and made more suffering on an economic, social and individual level, that wildly roaming sars cov 2 would do...And how ""they"", which is ultra rich, want to grab even more money and how the governments want to grab more power, control and surveillance ""thanks"" to this...Well, as for the Turkey. i hope it will be open soon. I will go either there or to Georgia or Albania in next 1-2 months.Each of these countries is beautiful, with great history, food and people and with very reasonable prices :-)"
"#62, try analysing also data found here: https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/ . Next, you could visit any of the hospitals in countries hardest hit by the virus, and ask the staff there, doctors, nurses, etc how they remember past months, week, days. Then you might want to come back, to various forums you are posting your views, and tell us if you have learned something.Really sad that other people life means so little to you.

"Asif, I had to Google ""getting all up in your grill"". Urban Dictionary came to my aid. You make a good point. The British actually are natural social-distancers. Observe a train carriage or bus. We Brits naturally maximise the space between us, sitting alone and in silence. A bus in Spain, Italy or Greece fills from the front with practically every seat taken in order and everyone talking at the tops of their voices to each other. It is similar in banks and post offices, where we Brits lead the World in our queuing etiquette :-) In Southern Europe, a bank or post office is a chaotic talking shop with no apparent queue (but everyone knows who arrived after them). One of the most consistent complaints in hotel reviews by Brits is about other nationalities not queuing. So Asif, you are completely right. I can there there may be war on the beaches if we Brits are standing in line, neatly spaced 2m apart and other nationalities seize our apparent weakness as the opportunity to get to the bar/buffet/lift etc. first. I must admit I have told a fair few people off over the years for pushing in.wroclowersilesiatrip, I would say that only 2% of the population having had Covid is very worrying. That means 98% remain susceptible to it. Covid is a very infectious disease and there is no cure. It takes at least around two thirds of the population to have antibodies to achieve any sort of 'herd immunity'. Extrapolate the other way - how many more deaths before herd immunity is achieved? The mortality rate is somewhere between 0.5% and 1%. The population of Poland is around 38M. Two thirds x 0.75% x 38M gives around 190,000 deaths before the population of Poland starts to have herd immunity. The facts are similar for all countries. The way they are going, the USA may get there first after 1.6 million deaths. Business comes first in Trump World. Social distancing is there only to slow the infection rate down to try to allow health services to cope and buy time to develop and roll out a vaccine. Without a vaccine, most of the World's population will eventually contract Covid, one way or another.I would love to see strict, socially-distanced queuing enforced in Turkish hotels. 'Queuing saves lives!' We soft Brits may finally have an advantage. I cannot see this happening for long somehow. I think when Covid cases start occurring in hotels it will be the death knell of tourism until there is a vaccine. Foreign tourism into Turkey may have a window in September/October but when guests start falling ill with Covid, they won't risk hotels staying open into the 'flu season' when the next big wave is expected."
Relaxation of restrictions - why would anyone go with the social distancing in place - let alone fly.! What sort of holiday would that be ? I think people are longing to go but as much as we love our holidays we cancelled October. Loss of £120 deposit rather than pay the full balance of £ 3330 and go through hoops to get our money back as cash not credit note/ voucher. We were struggling to get our refund for our April holiday via chargeback - eventually got the money refunded by the bank and in our account but they - the tour op have 45 days to challenge this ! Another 29 days wait and despite saying we do not want vouchers they have sent vouchers this week and to call to arrange our new holiday - no way. ! So whilst for some refunds may be straightforward it is not always so. I really would hold fire on booking anything. I am sure once it is safe lots won’t have the luxury of going due to job losses etc. There will be lots of choice for those of us that can.Turkey in any case would be our last choice once we feel we want to travel. We have gone there for 22 years and more than once a year- sometime 4 times. I was saying to my husband that after only ever holidaying abroad maybe holidays here might be our first venture on holiday - but I think some areas might not want tourists going as they have stayed Virus free !
"Toady, I think the reasons for going are the same as ever - weather, culture, scenery, service and socialising. Social-distancing on planes can only be a good thing! I accept the fares would have to rise but it would be worth it to have more personal space. I don't want to be a sardine.I think whatever the certification regime for the hotels turns out to be, it will only be observed on inspection and not in practice. Therefore people need to make their own judgements about their own safety of travel. I have made mine, I am returning as soon as I am allowed, after Summer of course - there is nowhere better than Yorkshire in the Summer :-)I have pencilled in the Norfolk Broads for next year just in case we are never allowed to leave the country again. However, I now have rising confidence that I will be in Side for October - albeit with nominal social distancing and free face masks. Copious quantities of lemon cologne and raki may be needed (only one ingested - but which? :-)Edited: 6:05 am, May 08, 2020 "
"Tim,Taking a 200 seater aircraft, how many seats do you envisage being passenger free in order to socially distance?"
"Andy,When you can control the air circulation, you simply ramp it up. Middle seat free (on 3-3 aircraft), except for same household members and increased air circulation would be better than 2m distancing with no air circulation. Everything is possible. Nothing is easy."
Impossible to do social distancing on planes. They can’t even do it in supermarkets here so no chance with planes. I have booked a holiday in turkey for late sept. £15 deposit and full payment 10 days before travel so I will make my decision then when I have checked what’s happing open at the hotel. If you have to wear masks and so on then I won’t go but if it’s not massive changes I will go.. As bad as all this life MUST carry on
"On a typical a320 / b737 you'd get no more than about 30 - 35 passengers - approx 1/6th capacity.This is assuming they only allow one person on each side of the aisle, and keep every other row empty.Hence 5 out of 6 seats empty.Which by the way I feel is still not going to guarantee you staying safe if someone with covid19 was on board, masks or no masks.Edited: 7:49 am, May 08, 2020 "
">>>I have booked a holiday in turkey for late sept. £15 deposit and full payment 10 days before travel so I will make my decision then when I have checked what’s happing open at the hotel. <<<Just curious what happens if you don't pay up. Do you only lose the deposit, or do they come after you for the balance regardless?If it is only the deposit that you lose, then that seems like a reasonable risk to take.I'm in the process of booking travel at Xmas and Easter (Not to Turkey), so I agree, life must carry on, but clearly we need to try and mitigate as much of the risk as possible."
"@Asif, I agree. Planes seem like an unnecessary risk, unless you've got one to yourself.What about a return to passenger liners? :) (I'm not joking.) I'd rather sit in my cabin, if the central air conditioning is turned off, than take a plane."
Asif I only lose my deposit if I cancel as long as I cancel 11 days before I am due to go. I have no issue flying at all. I am not trying to play down the corona virus at all but life must go on and I have as much chance catching it at work or at a supermarket as I have on a airplane

We can't be using plastic straws.>>Which by the way I feel is still not going to guarantee you staying safe if someone with covid19 was on board, masks or no masks.Yes, that is why I say it will be a personal decision. Take responsibility for your own health, etc. I will travel regardless. I believe I am immune and what is life for? No one wants to live forever. It is best to have to pleasure in whatever time remains. Just remember you are most likely to die at home and be murdered by someone you know. Therefore it is best to get away from home and avoid people you know :-)"
Tim we don’t often agree but I do agree with your post 74
"""How can you drink G&T with a mask on? We can't be using plastic straws.""That, at least, is easy. Your personal https://tinyurl.com/y8mhzo6y is the obvious solution. :)"
"I also agree with the the, ekhm, SPIRIT of the post #74 ;-)"
"""I believe I am immune and what is life for?"" - believing it or knowing it might be a difference between life and death for a third party involved without his/her consent.But relax. This one will go away, one way or another. Life will go on, one way or another. The question is, for how many of us. Not going to holidays for one year surely is not the worst outcome?!"
"“ believing it or knowing it might be a difference between life and death for a third party involved without his/her consent.”Well that’s not strictly true is it ? Because any time a person walks out the door they take the risk of catching corona. So the third party also has a choice in this. If they are that worried then don’t leave the house AT ALL until the virus has passed if it ever passes.Some people including my self are following what the government has said, and if the government allows people to go on holiday then I fail to see the problem with flying or going on holiday. If the government says no we are banning international flights then of course me and others would obey by them rules. My point is the world can not carry on like this. We take risks in life all the time, every time you get on a plain you take a risk, 600 people in 2018 died from crashes. You take a risk every time you walk across a road. You take a risk when you drive. People that smoke risk there lives every day with every cigarette they smoke. People take risks of disease every time they sleep with a new partner.People that drink alcohol 3/4 times a week take a risk with there health. People that eat the wrong food take risks with there lives. What is happening at the moment is very bad, very sad but as a world we can not carry on like this for ever, there is already talk of more famine because of this, people committing suicide, people losing there jobs, people losing there homes, Countries going bankrupt.companies going bust. If we carry on in lockdown for another six months there will be more pain, suffering and death than the corona virus causes"
"There we agree, 3-eagle-hunter. My point was more toward that we all should be acting in a way to minimise the risk (every risk). If we accept that there is a danger out there, we can act accordingly. If we do not accept that there is a risk out there, we might hurt ourselves, and hurt others. Informed decisions, and following what each government is requiring from us all. That is, better to be informed about then to believe in. And yes, it is also my opinion that economically and socially the lockdown (not the social distancing) is not something most of the world countries could sustain for a longer period of time."
"I would like to only mention that if you are 92 years old, you are pretty much aware that ANY bacterial infection, any virus infection, any injury can be deadly for you. Isn't it natural and obvious? Not only this new virus that ""has its time now"". So many old people die every year out of something that for a person in his 20s or 30s wouldn't do anything serious.Unfortunately, we are not programmed to live forever, and it concerns any living organism on this planet...Also, I don't remember saying that I would like to force 90 years old people to get out, to ride metro all around or do jogging, sweat and catch cold...It's up to any individual to take care of himself, but its ridicolous to stop living for all because of the risks that the life brings...Also, I think that I kind of proved in my post #62 that actual mortality rates are WAY BELOW what is being posted and reposted all the time (""around 1 %""). If the official governement stats of the ""infected"" are 15 K people for the whole country, among these few hundred deaths, AND later it appears (by the real scientific reseach, math and stats) that its actually 20 K potentially infected per every 1 mln people (as for now), that had no SYMPTOMS... well, guess how it influence the mortality rate....My estimate for this one is around 0.1-0.2 %. The thing is to protect/ separate people that are in groups of risks, thats all.Viruses and biology are actually very interesting field... Now its being reported that after huge pandemic of flu during and after WW1, few years later, new mysterious virus appeared in the world. It was named ""sleping sickness"", had similar symptoms to what happens with the people after tse tse fly, and guess what, it infected few millions people in 1920s...It is still unknown what it really was...There are some theories now that it could be somehow connected to spanish flu epidemic, but even today, the scientists dont know anything conclusive about it (except that it happened and infected few million people)...Why I am saying this? I find a little disturbing the news coming from many countries today, that there is a new mysterious illness that attacked dozens of children and has symptoms similar to ""Kawasaki disease""...As for the herd immunity with sars cov 2- well guess what, the steps that most of the governments took, made it kind of impossible to get one ;-) I dont blame them THAT MUCH. Its natural to be scared of something new, however, sadly, its also natural for politicians and people to be short sighted and take some steps not realizing the damage that you may do in long term, worse than the illness itself.However the problem is, that you don't get that much herd immunity for the flu or cold for example. Every year, these viruses infect millions of people worldwide, and every year, these viruses change. So good luck with working and safe vaccine for sars cov 2!Luckily., its not the Ebola guys. And like someone said before, ""we will just learn to live with it"", just like we did with flu. And luckily for the most of us, its not dangerous at all."
"#81 a travel forum is no place to discuss health. So I am always happy to share my side vs yours, but some othe place. For now, I am also happy to follow whatever my government is telling me to do, and if and when I will be a guest again, to do whatever host country will tell me to do. Only one thing, about herd immunity. Have you ever read/heard about any other disease that has actually reached herd immunity naturally (not through vaccination) in any population? If so, please share a link - maybe by PM?"
">>That, at least, is easy. Your personal https://tinyurl.com/y8mhzo6y is the obvious solution. :)Excellent suggestion, GG. There is just a risk of looking like a cyberman and frightening the cats.3-eagle, I also agree with your post, #79! If people had a firm grasp of how people die instead of just those ways that sell newspapers, we could better manage the risks in everyday life. In particular, it will be interesting to see the 'excess deaths' figures when they are available over the recent period and see what proportion were not attributed to Covid but rather related to the measures brought in to combat it - e.g. extra suicides, murders, heart attacks, etc.. Overnight (I am an insomniac), the BBC World Service did a very interesting one-hour programme on the resumption of the aviation industry:https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cszcmtThe experts pretty much agreed with the points already raised in this thread - perhaps they are reading it :-). One one side, flights can resume between pairs of countries that have similar measures in place with the risks mitigated by measures such as health screening upon arrival at airports (thermal cameras and questionnaires), hand sanitisers, masks, empty middle seats etc., and on the other side, to use the opportunity to permanently reduce air travel. It was mentioned that travellers be offered a test at around €200 to avoid two weeks quarantine upon arrival. I thought one expert was particularly honest, ""Nobody knows, not even pundits on the BBC"". Hence this ""best guesses"" discussion! We shall see what Boris and Erdogan announce in the coming days.Edited: 3:49 am, May 09, 2020 "
"#82You don't get herd immunity for the viruses of flu and cold...Just like you don't get working vaccine for these.They mutate every year. Same is/ will be with this virus. The only thing we can do is to get used to it, and if we are in risk group... take care of ourselves.I am not anti vaccine, I'm pro common sense. If you want to take vaccine every year or 6 months for flu, then good luck, go ahead. I won't.Also, bigger problem with coronaviruses - there was never vaccine made for that kind of viruses... Normal cycle of vaccine before it will be carefully tested etc is few YEARS, not months.If you want to be a guinea pig for some ""miracle drug"", that side effects will appear years later - sure go ahead. As for me, I prefer to trust my body and immune system (and luck) on this ;]As for the ""trusting government"", sorry, LOL, most of them proved how clueless they really are (except maybe Sweden). So I don't believe in any authority, just because it is supposed to be authority...Maybe this virus will disappear next year, or mutate into something even less harmful overall. Or maybe it will mutate into something more deadly, but much less contagious...We never know.Edited: 8:10 am, May 09, 2020 "
"wroclowersilesiatrip, My academic experise was in 'artificial evolution', i.e. creating computer models of evolution to solve otherwise unsolvable problems - those with no algorithmic solution nor data set from which to learn. You just set it off and see what happens. My main takeaway lesson is that you don't mess with evolution! It is far more powerful and faster moving than legacy species such as humans.I have always argued against GM crops for this reason. It is not a question of whether they are safe to eat, it is the real and significant risk that some new organism will evolve quickly to be their new 'pest' and in the process wipe out life as we know it. Evolution takes no prisoners. I am not, yet, suggesting that Covid is the result of GM but it is suspected that Covid-19 originated in bats, spread through wild animals and that humans are increasingly taking away the natural habitat of both. Hence more contact. As a species, we were a petri dish getting ever closer to nurture a deadly virus. Nature gets its revenge occasionally - a 'correction'. From my perspective, evolution had an opportunity it could not leave unfulfilled. As you suggest, I think we will be living with mutations of Covid for many years, possibly as long as humans last on the planet. So each of us just have to make our choices - hibernate or enjoy life. In terms of the days when smoking was allowed on planes, despite never being a smoker, I was there at the back of the plane drinking and partying rather than be with the puritanical, vegetarian, teetotallers at the front who never spoke to each other. So it shall be.Edited: 8:46 am, May 09, 2020 "
Seems everyone is a scientist and/or health care expert on TripAdvisor these days.
"I had my bank ring me again as supposed to go june 24th asking what I wanted to do now heard yesterdaythat jet 2 isent flying till end of july we are staying in green nature still so undecided what to do book end sept hopeing its all going to open no restrictions my youngest son only came out of hospital om Thursday after being in hospital for 5 weeks with covid the only place he had been was shopping for his wife and 6 children he also had pneumonia he was on icu for nearly 4 wks so you can catch it anyhwhere we were looking forward to going to marmis as never been been to other parts but not there my head id going round do like I said go last wk in sept and 1st wk oct or book for next june ,july please any comments with help wouls be helpful thank you xxx"
"Yesterday, we had a few beers and meal with our whole family for the first time in almost 2 months....It was better than any holiday.Who cares if we can't visit Turkey this year....far more important things."
I agree Andy but do your family live with you? l am asking as l haven’t been able to have my children or grandchildren over due to this lockdown so l haven’t seen them since it all started and there’s no rule change on that yet ...
"Blimey Tim, you should go on Mastermind, I'm well impressed with your Scientific knowledge, but take your sombrero off first."
"Calamara, never!"
"IATA says aircraft are ""as safe as operating theatres"" and no social distancing is required on them:https://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/3706…Then they would say that, wouldn't they?"
I would encourage everyone to substitute the faces of the Monty Python team onto that panel and remember the dead parrot sketch.
"From the Hurriyet in English:https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-wor…""The government has already removed travel restrictions imposed on seven provinces, including the country’s key tourism destinations Muğla, Antalya and Aydın. “We are also anticipating a revival in foreign tourism activity in mid-July,” he said, adding that they are in close contacts with the U.K, Germany and Russia, which send a considerable number of visitors to Turkey. The plan for the tourism industry was also discussed at the meeting. The blueprint foresees that restrictions on flights and inter-city bus services will be eased, measures will be taken to prevent excessive price hikes at tourism facilities and hygiene rules will be strictly observed at airports and tourism venues.""If hotel occupancy rates are being reduced to 60% to maintain social-distancing rules, then I expect that means ""price-hikes"" may be limited to something around 1.67 x previous rates, maybe more if they don't surcharge existing bookings."
"The U.K. will be the very last on that list probably. We are now said to be the worst affected country in the world after the US.. So who would risk it? We can’t even be with our families yet Tim, let alone on a plane with strangers.I like your positive attitude but this situation is going to have a major impact on tourism l think."
"Tim, I think you are correct, by the end of Sept/start of Oct it will be business as usual, the flights will be full to the rafters."
"Ahhh but it depends how the numbers are collected and presented. Cases per 1000 of population, population density of the country etc. There’s a lot of trust issues with the figures as well."

"The new quarantine law is going to put many off. What about all the people who are back in work when they come home. It’s not going to happen. It really doesn’t appeal to me to be distancing, wearing a mask and feeling like my holiday is more like being stuck in a prison. Locals in Turkey over 65 and under 20 can’t go out.. at all. My friend who lives in Fethiye hasn’t been outside for weeks. Many holidaymakers are in this group, retired and families with children under 20. There won’t be a separate rule for them . And we need holiday insurance... no company is covering us for Covid and l can guarantee the Turkish HS won’t want a gang of Brits who may get sick by not following the rules, littering up their hospitals. We will just have to follow advice, keep waiting and be sensible. We will all be able to go over in time and if it’s next year before we can, so be it. It’s a holiday. Staying well is the plan."
"I agree with Vip & Josephine. There are huge trust issues with the data: under-reporting, under-testing, lags, political manipulation etc. No two countries are reporting their official figures in the same way. It appears the more authoritarian the regime, the lower the mortality rates are and also the harsher the punishment for any whistleblowers. I am sure an awful lot more is known than is in the public domain. Let us hope that the secret data informs public policies wisely. The UK quarantine rule, just formally announced by the PM within the last hour, is a very soft quarantine as far as I understand. Someone arriving in the UK will have to supply an address where they will promise to self-isolate for 14 days. To me, that means if you are employed and cannot work at home, don't go on holiday abroad. This could be a boost for UK domestic tourism in the short term in lieu of foreign visitors - the PM also set out a timetable for the UK hospitality sector to reopen. I would guess bilateral arrangements between countries will start cropping up, where quarantine is not required in either direction subject to agreed measures, in due course and that Turkey would be very keen for this to happen with the UK. Travel insurance is yet another can of worms. Some form of certification looks likely but equally this could be self-certification along the lines of how pre-existing medical conditions are handled - either not covered or pay a fortune extra to be. I feel in the the last few days, we have started to see courses plotted but it will still take months to get through and systems to be in place, even with the best data.Edited: 3:17 pm, May 10, 2020 "
"Added to that Tim the PMs latest announcement tonight is awful. Everyone can go back to work, go out and about as much as we want but yet still can’t see family of friends. For many of us that was a really important step forward.  So it means this situation is going to be drawn out for an even longer period of time now.What a total mess."
josephinehe you can meet family or friends outdoors as long as keeping social distancing
"I know but l don’t live that near to mine, they are scattered in different towns, and driving too far not allowed. So it goes on!"
And me and my friends just meet up in cafe so it will be a while yet till that can become a plan !
"3-eagle that was not contained in tonight's broadcast. I listened to BBC's R4 Pm coverage of it when politicians from all sides as well as experts were questioned by Evan Davies, ""Can I go and see my parents, keeping a distance?"". All said they didn't know, that was not mentioned.The change in message was go to work if you can rather than work from home if you can. It is the right wanting to get workers back to their businesses, just as with Trump, to make money for them with little regard for their workers loved ones. As Dominic Cummings was reported as saying, ""Let some old people die"", the departure from WHO mandated procedures and the latest announcement show a shocking disregard of humanity over their self-interests. I have will have a drink of cider now.Edited: 3:47 pm, May 10, 2020 "
"Yes Tim good for you! drowning mine in a glass as well! It certainly doesn’t bode well for an early return to normal least of all holidays, but these are difficult and unusual times for us all to be fair."
"On bbc news. “ From Wednesday, in England, there will be no limit on the exercise you go outside to do. You can sit in the park and read. You can sunbathe...You can meet one person from outside your own household if you stay two metres apartSo, you can sit next to a single friend in the park, but you must socially distanceAnd, you can drive to parks and beaches in England but you must socially distance when you get there”I don’t think you are allowed to be indoors with people from the same house hold but I presume you can all sit outside and chat the same way 1000s did for VE Day. Also at the moment no quarantine rules to be put in place for travel between France and England"
"Yes, 3-eagle, your last point is very interesting. The BBC report that a working group between the French and UK governments is to be set up to thrash out the details of how the reciprocal exemption from quarantine will work. Presumably that could then be the template for such arrangements with other countries including those desperate to welcome UK tourists - e.g Spain, Greece, Italy and Turkey? Raab has being doing the media rounds this morning trying to explain 'Stay alert!' (anagram: 'Lay at rest!'). The quarantine exemption between UK & France seems to primarily to permit import/export between France & the UK when the quarantine comes in - yes it will apply to the ports too. Regards meeting family not in the same household, they can meet outside in a park and play tennis, but not football."
"There’s a lot of very disappointed families after last night, that’s for sure. Many of us are past running round the park days, and just want our kids & grandkids over and to make them a nice meal. This is all designed to try and get the economy moving, which is ok but grandparents come last...... again."
"It’s not just grand parents. For instance I’ve not been able to see my partner for 9 weeks, golf courses are going to open but I still can not play with my friends so everyone is in the same situation and we just have to follow the rules for the moment"
"I know l have family members with same problem, and while we are keeping to the rules, so many are just rubbishing them.... my son said the trains are jam packed today going to work, yet it’s not supposed to change till Wednesday but it’s all gone mad already. This is a big reason the U.K. is so badly affected, too many people who ignore sensible guidelines so the rest of us have to pay the price."
