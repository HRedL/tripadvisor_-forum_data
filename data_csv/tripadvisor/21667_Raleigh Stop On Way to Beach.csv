"Our family is headed to Topsail Beach from Indiana the first week of September. We have three small kids (under 5) We’re considering leaving Friday, stop and sleep, then stop in Raleigh Saturday before we go to the beach. We lived in Raleigh a few years ago for a short time, and fell in love. If we stop, we’d definitely like to eat at the State Farmers Market and pick up some goodies for our vacation. When we lived there we like to visit playgrounds, pools and pick berries. Because of Covid and the possibility it’s super hot, what else can we do besides the farmers market? What’s open outdoors the kids would love and could give us a few hours? Thanks!"
"City of Raleigh pools are open but they recommend you reserve a spot ahead of time. Their spraygrounds/splashpads are closed, though. The only sprayground that I know of that is open is the Taylor Street Park one in Wake Forest.The new Southeast Raleigh YMCA has a great pool, but even if you are a member of the Y up there I would call to see if they are honoring reciprocity during Covid. You could go to Yates Mill park and look at the mill and water coming over the dam, or Oak View park and look at the goats.Good luck!"
They just closed Lake Johnson Pool due to COVID.
"The Farmers Market is open and so is the restaurant. https:/…Know that the set up is kinda different and lost of folks wearing masks (not all, to my chagrin) but you can still get your berries, watermelon, corn and tomatoes for the beach. For other things to do near there is Pullen Park, but I can't find if the amusements (train, etc) are operating. I think the park is back open though. https:/…pullen-park-amusementsAlso on that side of town, there is also Lake Johnson, with the boathouse, boats, Again, I think the park is back open and they are renting boats again, but not sure what else: https:/…lake-johnson-park I think the Lake Johnson pool is open, but not sure about the splash ground. But you could spend some run around time along the lake. There is also Dorothea Dix park, but it is just a big beautiful park with a great view of the city, so not a playground or any amenities yet. It is right. next to the farmers market. https://dorotheadixpark.org"
