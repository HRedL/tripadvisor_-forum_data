Holiday Pirates has just announced on its site that Portugal set to be removed from list meaning no quarantine. Not seen it anywhere else yet. Not due to travel to Albufeira till October so fingers crossed.
Hope it's effective from tomorrow as that's when I fly!
I think it's expected to begin Monday
"Wait for the official announcement, the dates from when not having to quarantine on return become effective.Last time the media got it wrong and it all changed at the last minute.Cases today in Portugal still ovèr 200..Don,t book or cancel anything until we know.."
Announcement due on Monday and several outlets reporting Portugal will come off the quarantine list then.
"I hope so ! Just taken advantage of EasyJet’s decreasing airfares in Sept/Oct. return flight £45 , no brainer. Of course if the quarantine is still on I will just move them . Stay safe everyone ."
"Mixed messages as to whether I could still come out of quarantine on Monday, or from the effective date.. Read an interview with Shapps where he told a reporter that if people arrived from Spain a couple of days after the airbridge had been established, they would then only have to quarantine for those days."
"Spain's cases today 2615, it's Spain that the UK government should be concerned with and the Portuguese government.Anyone here will know that the Algarve is a popular destination for the Spanish..."
"He told BBC Breakfast that passengers who are currently isolating for 14 days will be able to break the restrictions legally from next Friday.He said while “nothing could happen” before July 10, “from that point onward you will be legal not to quarantine yourself”."
"Don,t you mean August 10th."
No. This was a quote from an earlier interview when Spain and other countries were taken off the quarantine list so I assume the same principle will apply.
Ah good old Mr Negative
Why are you telling people not to book holidays ?. If people want to book they can book Terry it’s not for you to say. I’ve followed this forum for a while now and not one positive thing comes out of your mouth have you got nothing better to do than sit on trip advisor all day.
If you cannot go into quarantine because of work commitments then of course you should not book until you know the date if Any that the rules will change..If you can wait until Monday before having to cancel then waitIgnore the press they got it wtong lasst ti me and wait until you see the rules in Black and White from the Government.It's just a few more days...
its now looking like 1m cases every 4 days worldwide why anyone would want to go on holiday beggars belief stay at home folks and lets ALL meet up and enjoy 2021..... please
"Well said JohnC . BTW I often don't often agree with TERRY R and some of his posts, but he is correct. Also if the FCO still have Portugal as all but unnecessary travel regardless of an airbridge your travel insurance will be void. Would you risk it, I wouldn't, but entirely up to you as an individual.Edited: 6:01 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"jayjan still waiting for my money back from ryanair, p,s we booked early feb before the IF ONLY WE KNEW,,,, moment"
JohnC got my refund back from Ryanair 2 weeks ago for cancelled flights 27th April /6th May. Good luck with yours.
"ours was for june 13th so prob still a bit to go, i just love the way they slate the irish gov for their quarantine recommendations but are still keeping the likes of myself monies for months on end which i heard legally they need to pay back after 7 days of a cancelled flight.....will still book with them though lol"
"Unbeleivable , so many complaints about them on facbook. Yes flight are still so cheap with them but have you seen how much they are now charging extra for luggage. They have doubled their charges for 20kg bags and also 10kg bags. Priority boarding seems to stay the similar price, but only so many places available for that, hence book early. Marketing ploy in my eyes.Edited: 7:10 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Sadly I have to agree, while the border with Spain remains open, we personally see a risk to booking anything at the moment. With numbers rising in all three countries, (even with some, not telling the whole story) it's only a matter of time before more, not less, restrictions are reintroduced. What's seen as OK next week, may not be the same as next month and we can't afford to be stuck in the wrong place. Add this to the high risk situation in airports and on flights, we probably won't be able to fly out in the coming weeks. I've regrettably no choice but to reschedule our August flights to next year, still hopeful that our end of September flights can go ahead, although even that's starting to look doubtful .Whilst I appreciate how difficult it is for all businesses and would love nothing more than to support some of them, the longer this whole situation is permitted to continue, the more that will eventually go out of business. Travel is what spread this around the globe, the short term gain is only exacerbating the long term pain."
"Looks like it isn't going to happen just yet!https:/…Edited: 7:46 am, July 24, 2020 "
"Yes, breaking news in local media and UK Daily Telegraph that mainland Portugal is still considered too dangerous for Brits to visit, so quarantine on return will continue.Spain is OK, even Barcelona.Try telling this to the 99.8% of people here who have never contracted this so called evil virus. Farewell to much of our tourist industry for ever if British are continually dissuaded from coming.Edited: 8:43 am, July 24, 2020 "
"I’ve got to say that imo this decision appears bizarre. Parts of Spain, and also France, are now giving real cause for concern. I don’t know, but I am wondering whether it is related to healthcare systems in each country and their track and trace systems? Anyone familiar with the Portuguese system able to comment on this? Cheers."
"BBC carried it in the lunchtime news.Portugal is not too dangerous to travel to.Over 2 thousand flights are scheduled to Portugal from the UK by the end of August.You can travel if you accept the rules on quarantine and the need to upgrade your insurance for Covid cover..All this new means is that fewer may decide to travel.Because Portugal has open borders and over the summer, probably 100s thousands will travel from France and Spain this may have influenced the UKs decision..Edited: 9:02 am, July 24, 2020 "
"""Portugal is not too dangerous to travel to.""Obviously the UK government don't feel the same way, why else would they say all but essential travel?I accept that on the face of it, it seems bizarre, however there has to be good reason for their thinking. We just aren't party to it.Edited: 9:12 am, July 24, 2020 "
"If it was "" dangerous "" there would not be allowing over 2000 flights in Auguast.The government statement is an Advisory not an instruction.."
Portugal s infection numbers 313 an increase. Maybe this has something to do with not including Portugal in today's list of non quarantine on return.
When will they review the list again .day by day or week by week
"Yes the graph is showing a steep rise over the past two days. Since yesterday, nine more cases have been reported in the Algarve region, 253 in the Lisbon region, three in Madeira ( a lower number per head of population than the Algarve) and the remainder across other regions. Clearly alarming and good enough reason to cancel holidays.Will they wait until the number of new cases is zero I wonder?We shall probably have to revert to beach,restaurant and bar closures very soon, even curfews, to keep people apart.Across the country, 420 people are hospitalised with 52 in intensive care.I am going to enjoy my night out tonight while I still can!"
"Ask your MP? Another month perhaps??As I just suggested, will they wait until Portugal reports zero new cases?If so, they will probably wait for ever."
"The Algarve Reside t site, has a statement from the British Embassy in !Lisbon."
"Just read this""The government also said it will update guidance weekly, meaning rules could change while people are away.""Well at least that means it probably won't be any worse for those already here. Pity those in Spain though."

"UK papers, the ones that only a couple of days ago were telling us that Portugal would be removed from the quarantine list are now reporting that countries are placing restrictions or considering placing them on travel to Spain.Norway also dud not remove its restrictions on travel to Portugal .With Ireland also doing the same.The UK is not alone..Belgium and Holland have also issued advice to its citizens.."
and now Spain on the red list. What a shame for tourism in s europe this year
"Hi just for ones in the area at the moment can you see another lock down happening soon or just regional do you think, we are due to travel on Saturday to carvioreo Thanks"
"From midnight tonight, Sunday Times.Fears that Spain could be seeing the start of a second wave."
"Portugal is on the quarantine list already, I do not see any other changes in the short term.Here in Carvoeiro the temps are in the High 30s.Our pool has never been this warm 32.5 degrees.The only thing missing are Tourists.

i loved the comment from the teacher who said due to work commitments she could not quarantine for 14 days??? eh she is a teacher is she not off for 6 weeks or so
"JohnC maybe she is not travelling until the last two weeks of school holidays when they & the children hopefully return back to school, therefore she will have to quarantine. The whole thing has cocked everyone's holidays for 2020. Roll on 2021 and praying everything changes for the best."
"she was flying out this sunday, everybody and i mean everybody should have an extra weeks vacation when this is all over and hopefully tourism gets all the vat rate breaks from goverments for at least 2 years as no point 1 year sweeteners as even this year they have bills to pay with no money coming in,,,,,"

"Another word of warning about the Portuguese statistics published (almost) daily ... the Algarve total went up by 21 new cases yesterday ... that would be equivalent to around 270 in Scotland, where the daily numbers are rising again .. to 27. Despite the (apparent) rise in Algarve ... not a single one of the main districts .. Lagos, Portimao, Silves, Albufeira, Loule, Faro, Tavira or VRSA .. showed any increase ... you cannot believe that .. we are where we are because of bad government in Portugal, Spain and UK ... dont see that improving anytime soon .. but nice to see the beaches look quite busy again .. stay safe .."
"We are starting to here a few more English voices in rental villas but they are the exception, it's Portuguese, French and German visitors who are replacing them.Brits tend to eat out , go to bars , others as we have notuced this year stay in their villas for most of their stay. Good news for the supermarkets but not other business,The general view locally is that bookings will be down by at least 50 % this year.PLenty of room on the larger beaches even with numbers restricted ..The BBC this morning again Made reference to the insurance issue for those travelling to any country where a travel advisory is in force. Such as Portugal and now mainland Spain..Although ironically the Spanish islands are included in the 2 week quarantine but not the travel advisory.."
Is it really that much of a hardship to forget foreign travel this year?The worlds being ravaged by a virus but some folk still insist they need a break in the sun?Stay home and stay optimistic for next year.
"""Is it really that much of a hardship to forget foreign travel this year?""Reading these forums, it would appear so. I really can't understand the mentality of those obsessing about taking a holiday.In my opinion, it would make far more sense for everyone to stay at home this year in order to prevent a recurrence of the virus (which is already starting to happen) and hopefully next year we can all start venturing abroad again."

"Re the following - ""In my opinion, it would make far more sense for everyone to stay at home this year in order to prevent a recurrence of the virus (which is already starting to happen) and hopefully next year we can all start venturing abroad again"".We are in Portugal just now, and far more people are wearing masks than in the UK. Everyone on public transport and in shops is wearing masks and quite a lot of people are also wearing them in the street. It worries me when I read that in the UK only 50% of people are wearing masks on public transport and that shops are not enforcing mask wearing. We feel more secure here than in the UK"
"Many people have worked throughout the lockdown, not myself but I know many who have worked harder and longer hours than normal. They need a holiday. Not everyone has been watching daytime tv and having bbqs in the garden for the past four months.In my humble opinion, travelling to the Algarve does not need to be a time of anxiety and frustration, but at the moment, returning to the UK could well be.For many though, they are probably willing to take that chance."
Sadly I think we are just going to cancel our holiday for October.We booked the flights with Easyjet last year and have yearly insurance cover. I know we can postpone flights but we I'd prefer a refund or even a voucher. Anyone know where we stand as mixed messages and I'd prefer an idea before spending an hour or two on hold trying to ring Easyjet.I've already postponed Crete from June this year to September next year and possibly pushing it to choose dates with my employer for next year for another holiday.
"""Anyone know where we stand as mixed messages and I'd prefer an idea before spending an hour or two on hold trying to ring Easyjet.""If the flight is still available, I think you would lose your fare as they are supplying what you ordered. Would suggest you talk to your insurance company first if they will pay out in the circumstances you describe. You'll find it easier to talk to your insurance company than Easyjet."

“ It worries me when I read that in the UK only 50% of people are wearing masks on public transport and that shops are not enforcing mask wearing.We feel more secure here than in the UK “I feel more secure here in Scotland where mask wearing is the norm and we have had no COVID related deaths for 10 days now.
"https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaThese figures show the cases per 100,000 as population sizes vary. it is this figure which the government looks at. you can see Spain is double UK and Portugal is much higher too so it may feel safer but that doesnt mean it is."
"This will go on forever. Boris said for perhaps for another year. Meanwhile there have been no deaths from this for weeks in the Algarve. Suggests to me that the effects are mild. Airlines and tour companies are pressing for a more regional approach, so that entire countries are not banned because of a few people getting it in one small area.But where's the sense in that they will say? It would be easier for everyone to understand if ALL overseas travel to or from the UK is prohibited until this either goes away or something else comes along requiring an even stricter set of actions. OK so a few tens of thousands more working for airlines, ferries and Eurostar will be out of work but what's the priority here?"
"The map showing the 14-day COVID-19 case notification rate per 100 000, weeks 28-29 shows that the areas where infection rate is high in Spain and Portugal are confined to fairly narrow geographical areas - north east Spain and around Lisbon"

Further to my previous post I have again totalled the individual figures for 12 Algarve districts .. according to DGS, 655 ... but also according to the same reports, Algarve total figure has gone up to 853 ... what can you believe.

"@ William B - post #64.No deaths in Scotland for 10 days - how do you think we feel where I live, lumped in with the rest of England?There have been no hospital deaths in Sunderland for 34 days now and a minimal number of new cases identified - something like 17 or 18 over the last three weeks.Localised restrictions may well be the answer but I think that it may be too difficult to organise and police, so we are where we are.Hopefully by June next year, when we have our next family holiday booked, all this will be a distant menory."

"Because it’s only advise they haven’t banned travel. Annual leave is booked, flights are booked, Can’t cancel annual leave will lose money on flights if i don’t go because ryan air are continuing to fly to Faro. So i might as well go and sit in the sun for two weeks rather than sitting in the UK with all the doom & gloom flying about !"
My thoughts exactly I will be going in September.Life is too short to sit and be worrying about something that might not happen.As was said you have more chance catching it in the UK
"We came back at the weekend after a lovely week in Vilamoura. We were staying in a villa but we did eat out a few times and have a visit to the beach. Everywhere felt safe, masks and hand sanitizer everywhere. Even flying with Ryanair felt safe, lots of empty seats so it was possible to sit apart from other people. We are now carrying out our obligatory quarantine."

"At , cubsur has hinted at all the other viruses that might kill us on a plane but hasnt named any of them . I think he is in the it’s only flu camp , maybe he needs to look at the fact that in excess of 670k people have died and that is with restrictions before anyone compares it with “flu” !

Blue 259 I'd be interested to know which airport your flying from? With Easyjet planning to no longer base staff at Newcastle airport I wonder if flights will be affected?Took me two and a half hours to get through to Easjet. I can postpone flights but not allowed a voucher or refund.
"86/88 From Bristol. Email said inbound flt was cancelled and an hour later outbound flt 'disrupted'. Both on same booking ref. Have emailled them back asking for confirmation of cancellation, just in case of a glitch in their system. Will get back when they reply, if anything different."
We have had email confirmation from EJ to say our flight on the 9th August will be going ahead. Gatwick to faro.

Airlines will continue to tailor their schedules to match demand.For as long as the covid restrictions continue we can expect cancellations and rescheduling.
"I'm flying on 31st of August. From London, southend. But with Ryanair. No chance of ours getting cancelled! If we cancel, we lose £1100 if we go, i risk my mums health. If I postpone to next year, Ryanair want an extra £900 to change. Our hotel is closed but on the beach havent had confirmation so are saying its open. What a mess ☹"
"""No chance of ours getting cancelled!"" Want to bet?What do you think are the risks you may face coming to Portugal over and above staying at home and doing what you normally do?

"#94I would wait until closer to the date,Ryanair may cancel due to low numbers flying and the fact that Portugal is not making any of these ""green lists"" and then you will get your money back.......eventually!The flight change fees are a joke and if your new flight happens to be cheaper than the original flight ,they will not refund the difference nor can you use it as a credit towards the change flight fee.Then they charge change fees on top of that.If the original flight was booked before Covid 19 non essential travel advice,could you claim on your travel insurance?"
Hi#blue259.. we are due to fly out 2nd September- 24th Gatwick- faro had an email from easyjet 2 days ago saying our seating has been changed??
Well according to email received today our inbound flt Faro > Bristol has been cancelled so we can request a refund for total or change to earlier return flt time... err no. Refund it is then! Our insurance wouldn't cover us anyhow given the FCO advice. Such a pity but maybe a blessing in disguise?@ 97 yes we had an email 4 days ago... ''change of plane-different configuration of seats'' then y'day cancellation.
"""What do you think are the risks you may face coming to Portugal over and above staying at home and doing what you normally do? Other than the possible 14 day qurantine on return. "" They wouldnt be normally going through 2 airports and sitting on a plane with dozens of other people !"

"Cubsur and others are right the Algarve is safe.Safe as we have done since March, limit contact to just a few people.Only shop for essentisls following all the instructions on mask wearing social distancing.Avoiding bars, eating out just a few times and then only on outside tables.No public transport...If this is the holiday that appeals to you, then yes the Algarve is a safe destination."
No it’s not.If it was “safe” it would be on the green list.
"In cubsurs defence 650k people die as a result of flu each year, but they are expected deaths."
Terry you just given examples of how safe it may not be as let your guard down and you could get covid not a fun way to spend your holidays
"“ In cubsurs defence 650k people die as a result of flu each year, but they are expected deaths. “No defence.Suggesting that Covid and the annual flu are the same is grossly inaccurate."
That figure of 650k is the upper limit it can be as low as 290k
"Interesting Article “During a March 11 hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee on coronavirus preparedness, Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, put it plainly: ""The seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1%,” he told the congressional panel, whereas coronavirus is ""10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu,"" per STAT news."
"104.John, I do not totally disagree with you.Those, and we have seen them crowding into bars,, walking around in large groups taking up all of the pavements not wearing masks, and shopping aisles.Personal contact, kissing, shaking hands are exposing themselves to a higher risk from the virus.It's not a coincidence that cases have risen in the Algarve as tourist numbers increase.Today as the UK increases restrictions there are no restrictions on travel FROM the UK, from areas now deemed to be virus hotspots."
@TERRY R #101There is no public transport currently?
"Public transport is available.Schedules are reduced. Mask wearing mandatory. We have not used any, not even taxis. By doing so we have reduced the risk."
"102.William, safe as we have lived for the last 4plus months. But this is not how the vast majority of holidaymakers behave. Thereforw judged less than safe by the UK government nt."
"Public transport is reasonably busy here in northern Portugal. We have been on 7 trains and they have been fairly busy, though one between Valenca and Viana do Castelo was empty. On the busier trains we were still able to feel fairly comfortable as there was a reasonable distance between passengers and everyone were wearing masks. We took a bus today between Viana do Castelo and Ponte de Lima, which took an hour. It was busy with shoppers and one couple seemed to not to understand how to wear masks. The bus back was much quieter and we felt much safer. As has been said, some people do not seem to understand distancing and it is not just the Portuguese, a number of whom actually wear masks on the street. We feel marginally safer here in Portugal than in the UK, and we have sat outside in cafes and bars at least twice a day for over 2 weeks."
I am in Albufeira now and it is safer than back home. The strip has less people on it than my town centre back home. The Police were patrolling the Strip yesterday afternoon and had road stops outside Corcovada for over two hours yesterday. Being here and seeing how things are done with regards to Covid 19 has shown me how pathetic are Government is in keeping Portugal or The Algarve off the quarantine list.

"Posted the statement just to allay any concerns caused by #123. Which is nearer the truth, who knows?"
"Hello,I have flights in early September coming back to the UK on the 12th . Do you still think there are some chances that Portugal will be removed from the UK list until then?"
"I shall later be cancelling my flights booked to UKand back in mid September, as well as hotels. There is too much uncertainty about everything to leave things until the last moment."
To be honest your guess is as good as anyone's.All you can do is wait and see.It does not look likely at the moment .
It's entirely possible that UK could be on quarantine lists in the near future. The way people are behaving in bars is not encouraging.
So true Jack ...you can see it coming !! Some of the countries on the UK Red list are no where near as bad as what’s happening in the UK cities. Only for the business side I’m surprised anyone wants Brits abroad.

"Looking more positive:PORTUGAL COVID-19 DAILY UPDATEPortugal has reported no new coronavirus deaths for the first time since March, when a lockdown was put in place, and the lowest number of new infections in almost three months.The figures, reported on Monday, showed that the country’s total confirmed cases rose by 106 from Sunday to 51,568, with 62% of new infections reported in and around Lisbon.Meanwhile, Portugal’s death toll remained unchanged at 1,738."
"Portugal is full of tourists, not Brits but others from countries with high infection rates.There seem to be more French and Spanish cars on the road than the hire cars usually booked by Brits. Lower infection rates in Portugal should not be taken as a true reflection of what is happening here. A tourist staying for a week or two could catch and take it back with themThis happened in the UK with holidaymakers returning from Spain."
Or bring it with them. This ain’t going away anytime soon.
"Re #132 Most countries appear to have been 'fudging' the figures since the beginning. How they count and who they count. Portugal is still running at over 5,000 cases per million of population, which is higher than that of the U.K. at 4,500 despite the UK performing almost 84, 000 more tests per million of population. Portugal did extremely well in the early days and must be congratulated but numbers per million have been rising steadily in recent weeks, well that was until they managed to 'lower' their number of daily new cases."
"it just seem's strange to me as living in ireland with the strictest travel rules even our numbers have quadrupled from the lows of tens and below and what is france hiding no numbers for 3 days, AA said until they managed to lower the numbers, yea with a stroke of a pen no doubt"
Got to keep the money flowing
Here we go again.Press reports that Portugal is in discussions with the UK regarding the need to quarantine on return ( Bloomberg).This at the same time when there are also reports that due to the continuing number of cases the UK is considering increasing the number of countries where on return to the UK quarantine is required..There have been too many false dawns too much false optimism regarding Algarve tourism.
A post at 4.39am!Did you throw caution to the wind and go out raving with the kids last night Terry?
Just the two of us and the cat
