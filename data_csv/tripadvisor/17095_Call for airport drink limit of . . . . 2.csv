"From the BBC, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40929225""Ryanair has called on UK airports to enforce a two-drink limit, after a BBC Panorama investigation suggested arrests of drunken passengers have risen by 50% in a year."" Apparantly up from 255 to 387 in 12 months, Jet2 have said ""we can't allow it not to change"" and from the CAA ""The Civil Aviation Authority reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016 with ""most involving alcohol"". They say the increase is partly down to improved reporting of incidents""Obviously an essential measure long overdue as alchohol fueled disruption escalates year on year. An interesting quote :- ""Entering an aircraft when drunk or being drunk on an aircraft is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment "" and the sooner they start imposing those laws, handing out deterent sentences, and banning alchohol on flights, the safer we will all be."
Sounds really hard to enforce.
And how are they going to enforce this?I could have a flight at 10pm but spend the whole day in a pub and only get to the airport before the gate closes. Are they going to breathalyse everyone?
Did Ryanair also say they would stop selling alcohol on board to anyone who'd consumed their drink quota before the flight?
"Not sure how a limit can be enforced though, multiple bars and restaurants to police and what about self pour alcohol in the lounges?I do think the law should be changed to prohibit consumption of duty free purchases both in the terminal and onboard. As an aside on one of my BA flights last week a drunk passenger was allowed to board after a long conversation with the captain. The ground crew were already arranging to get his bags off when he was given the OK."
"The airports will never slow the booze flow, its too good a revenue stream.If they have to, then Ryan airs landing fees will go up to compensate for the revenue loss, so they'll be mad about that instead. Will Ryan air have a 2 drink limit in the air ?, I hardly think so. In fact I can see their drinks sales increasing if there is an airport limit.If Ryan air have concerns about how drunk passengers are; and lets be honest its normally groups on stag/hen outings so its not like they're hard to spot, well don't let them board. Surely that's their legal obligation ?"
"Sorry, but if I would like a couple of glasses of Champagne in an airline lounge, I'm going to have them, and I drink responsibly, never on an empty stomach..I drink very little alcohol in flight... it doesn't agree with me at altitude, so I might have a glass of wine or two long haul, but that's all generally. There should be better assessment of the drunken louts, who have had a skinful to drink in airport bars, as they stagger down to the aircraft door for boarding so they can be denied boarding and save disrupting sensible folks flight."
I think the main problem for the airlines is refusing boarding typically means offloading baggage which takes time and costs money. Obviously in the LCC segment they would prefer their passengers arrived sober and bought drinks onboard.
"Sounds like another issue of Ryanair saying stuff that will get them attention and keep them in the public spotlight...kinda like saying they'll charge for the bathroom or have standing-room only flights. Say something that they don't really plan to do, then get people to talk about them. No way it will happen."
< re they going to breathalyse everyone? >Based on my experience at the weekend it might be a good idea.
">>> Obviously in the LCC segment they would prefer their passengers arrived sober and bought drinks onboard.<<<Whereas, actually it is the LCC segment that *ARE* taking action, Ryanair have on many routes stopped selling drink and barred bringing duty free onboard, about 2 years ago. Jet2 have made all early morning flights alchohol free - I can''t remember the times - I think it was pre 8 or 10am, and it was Jet2 that called for policing of airport bars, which presently operate outwith UK licensing laws. And in their words - """" we can't allow it not to change"""" And they're right.I don't think it's hard to enforce at all . . . . ban all alchohol in the departure lounges and carry out the neccessary checks at security."
"I can't imagine this is enforceable, but I understand the logic. I am frequently surprised by the number of people on this forum who make comments that getting intoxicated is a key component of their flying experience. Sometimes they choose airlines based on who is perceived to serve the most free booze.We each have the things that are important to us when flying. The challenge with the drinking priority is to find a way to deal with those who are inebriated while still allowing freedom for more responsible drinkers."
"""Apparantly up from 255 to 387 in 12 months"" - Yes but that's out of 270 million passengers who passed through UK airports so it's important to keep the problem in perspective."
"I guess it comes out to this - in any given year, does Ryanair make more money off of alcohol than they spend on issues with drunk passengers? That simple equation might tell what they would really want to see happen, and I'm guessing they make more than they spend."
">>>it's important to keep the problem in perspective. <<<Ah, but it is in perspective Tom . . . . They obviously don't arrest nearly enough !!! They could have had 20 on my last flight home from Palma ;-)"
"I don't think it's hard to enforce at all . . . . ban all alchohol in the departure lounges and carry out the neccessary checks at security.-- I want to celebrate going away on a holiday. Travel for me at the moment isn't work related so it's because I'm going on holiday - just because some people can't drink responsibly doesn't mean we should all be punished. I do agree with licensing laws being enforced and you not being able to drink before a certain time but people should be kept accountable for their own behaviour. I also agree that there should be 3 checks to catch those travelling with hand baggage only - check in desk, security and the gate. They could even have a way of restaurants/bars taking a note of boarding passes when people sit down so that if they're drunk, they can notify the gate agents ahead of time."
"""I don't think it's hard to enforce at all . . . . ban all alchohol in the departure lounges""Which government is going to bring that legislation in? I can't see that ever happening in the UK."
"ban all alchohol in the departure lounges""<<<<and they just drink in the bars prior to departure lounge.Have been travelling for over 40 years, perhaps the routes I take, and never encountered problems with drunken passengers. Perhaps been lucky but keep the problem in perspective."
"There are plenty of things the airports and their retailers, airlines and the UK authorities could do, if they had the will to. Given that the airports/retailers and airlines want to make money off alcohol they're going to be the most resistant and the authorities will need to step in.1. Set ""US"" and ""Australia"" rules for selling duty free. All duty free is taken to the boarding gate by the merchant and handed over to the passengers as they are boarding. The US and Australia (all flights to Australia) rules are there for different purposes but they would prevent drinking DF in the departure lounge.2. All bars have to scan boarding passes for everyone served alcohol, with the data made available to all bars, the airlines and airport security. Then, if someone is blind drunk and causes trouble the source of the alcohol can be traced and the offending party - bar(s) or airline that lets them board - can be fined say £10,000 per infringement.3. Remove the airports' immunity from standard licensing laws, allowing the local authorities to set licensing terms and revoke them.If (a small but disruptive minority of) passengers want to treat an airport like a nightclub, then nightclub-like security and licensing may be required. And remember there are countries around the world where alcohol is banned on flights, and plenty of airports where the sale of alcohol is very strictly regulated (and sometimes banned altogether).Edited: 3 years ago "
"I don't drink so it does not bother me but having had to experience a drunk episode, I do support some form of limiting alcohol consumption.Maybe a very big sign saying, if you are drunk you can't fly? Or on your email confirmation nice big signs saying something like that. You're Drunk? You're denied boarding"
"I don't think it's hard to enforce at all . . . . ban all alchohol (sic) in the departure lounges and carry out the neccessary (sic) checks at security.--------------Sure thing. Ban all alcohol due to the fact some chavs, hooligans and others apparently can't get on a plane without getting soused. How about this? Fine them, put them on a no fly list for 10 year minimum and if necessary throw them in the clink.Why should I give up a drink in the lounge because of their intemperate behaviour?"
"Perhaps all adult boarding passes could have say two spaces for ""drinks"" which would have to be crossed out by the server. No open spaces, no more booze. I suggest this as one who definitely enjoys starting my holiday with a drink or two, especially if I have lounge access. :-)"
"I like the idea of scanning BPs as USBT suggests or having a checkoff as vnrose52 suggests.That might catch some people but, more importantly, prevent others from being drunk because they know about the rule. However, no rule will eliminate abuse entirely because people will find a way to skirt every rule. What I do think, though, should happen is a ban on exit row passengers drinking on the flight. This could be easily, clearly enforced by FAs and may leave these passengers more able to respond in an emergency. I realize they could drink before the flight, as they can now, but this rule might go a long way to ensuring those people are alert and aware to fulfill their roles. The rule should be clearly stated on the carrier's website and when these passengers select and pay for exit row seats. Just my $.02 (:"
Is alcohol consumption really that excessive in the U.K. ? I mean I know there are many negative stereotypes but I always thought that the alcoholic Brit was incorrect. It appears to be spot on.Edited: 3 years ago 
"How about all those people who get on the plane already under the influence. And how can you expect people to fly airlines like Ryanair, Spirit, Rouge and a few others without first having a drink or two. Actually I would have no trouble flying Ryanair sober but would have to be pretty drunk before sitting through the horror that awaits one on a Spirit flight."
"Is alcohol consumption really that excessive in the U.K. ? ==========Yes, among certain demographics. And those people are the ones that take ""party flights"" tanking themselves with booze before, during and after. Those flights tend to be short haul flights to party destinations on LCCs (cheap flight, more to spend on booze). My brother and sis-in-law visited me from the UK a few weeks ago and confirmed that they've been on many such flights from Manchester - most of their vacations are short haul - and the behavior of many has been disgraceful and they've all been drunk. The number of arrests (approx one arrest per day) is the tip of the iceberg.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I would agree with USBT,I am a regular traveller to Prague which is considered a stag party city for many and I have been on many flights where groups of mainly young lads were very drunk before they got on the flight and have been served even more alcohol on the flight. Over the last few years it has not been so bad as the flights I have been getting have been have been around 6-7.00 am so less chance to get tanked up.There seems to be no self control for some sections of the community and they get into a party mood as soon as they get to the airport and often earlier.Very difficult to control and though I think Ryanair suggestion may be unworkable at least dialogue has opened and we are at least saying there is a problem and something needs to be done to the benefit of all.I like many enjoy a drink at the airport (depending on time of day) but I like to stay in control of the alcohol I drink and if drinking was limited in airports and on flights I can live with that."
The media mentioned duty free selling miniatures. If they are selling miniature bottles of booze what's the point? They clearly are aimed at people drinking before and on the flight.
On the last few flights i have caught I have barely had time to get a drink - let alone get drunk. The long queues for security etc don't leave time for a relaxing glass of something prior to boarding. I don't think it needs banning - but bar staff (and airline crew selling booze) need to use their judgement.
"Bar staff use their judgement??? Your typical bar staff in an Airport bar are 18/25yo,minimum wage and zero hours contract. Why should they run the risk of verbal abuse or physical assault for refusing some drunken idiot a drink.Would you?"
"""2. All bars have to scan boarding passes for everyone served alcohol, with the data made available to all bars, the airlines and airport security. Then, if someone is blind drunk and causes trouble the source of the alcohol can be traced and the offending party - bar(s) or airline that lets them board - can be fined say £10,000 per infringement.""Worth doing at airside locations. Unenforceable landside though, and many airports have bars or restaurants that serve alcohol landside. For example my next booked flight is so early in the morning that I've booked a room in an airport hotel for the night before. I won't necessarily even have a boarding pass at this point, but it's not unreasonable to have a drink with an evening meal in a landside airport restaurant or hotel restaurant - it will be more than 8 hours and a night's sleep before I fly. Now if you combine the restriction on airside sales with LHR T5 style time conformance checks, it might at least mean that people who stay landside to get tanked up will effectively offload themselves early enough for airlines to remove baggage without delaying flights. Even better, the offloading then happens at one point in the airport - the entrance to security - where misbehaviour can be monitored and police intervention is simplified.Edited: 3 years ago "
I've read many trip reports on an airline website from passengers who use their Business Class lounges. They proudly list how much they have drunk before boarding and then what they've had on the flight. The amount of alcohol they admit to drinking is frankly staggering!
"<<And the sooner they start imposing those laws, handing out deterrent sentences, and banning alcohol on flights, the safer we will all be>>Yes I fully agree with the first two points of the above but the last one is a real bone of contention – why should every passenger on a flight, be it internal, short haul or long haul be denied the opportunity to have a alcoholic drink or two on their flight just because of the overall minority who cannot control themselves?Is banning alcohol and alcohol sales within the airport the answer – some will say yes and some will say no – but again it comes down o individuals and their behaviours. Having a drink or two, be it in the bar or in one of the lounges, is fine in my opinion – the issue is with those who take things too far and there will always be those who do that with their “I’m on holiday, I’m going to enjoy myself and I don’t care about anybody else”Yes, most passengers in the bars/loungers are also on holiday, also want to enjoy themselves but they don’t go to excessNot too sure what the answer is really on this one – some suggestions have been – 1 Some kind of stamp on a boarding pass – good idea but is it really 100% enforceable – there will always be a minority of bar staff who will still sell drinks to those who have gone over the stamp limit2 Ban all alcohol within airports – this could lead to job losses within bars, restaurants etc but also if this was enforced, human nature being human nature, passengers will get their fill of alcohol before arriving at the airport3 The solution I would go for would to be to deny boarding or even check in to these people before they even reach the plane if they are under the influence of alcohol and/or disruptive and if they do slip through the net and are disruptive during the flight then dish out the punishment when they are taken to court. If that means heavy fines, repayment of costs to airlines for rerouting a flight to offload them, travel bans etc then so be it Thankfully (touch wood) we have never had any disruptions on a flight due to alcohol related issues & long may that continue and we have flown both economy & upgraded for our long haul flights – the upgraded cabin does allow lots of alcohol but we have never seen this being abused, not saying it doesn’t happen just not seen it, it would appear the other passengers keep the drinking in moderation which is fair enough – and who really wants to go through border control at a foreign airport drunk - plenty of time to drink when you get to your destination"
"The drunk who wet himself on a late night Dublin - Liverpool Ryanair flight should never have been allowed on board. Him in middle seat, me in window seat .... UGH !!!"
"I've read many trip reports on an airline website from passengers who use their Business Class lounges. They proudly list how much they have drunk before boarding and then what they've had on the flight. The amount of alcohol they admit to drinking is frankly staggering!========Then regulate business class lounges. The Big3 US carriers' lounges in the US overwhelmingly don't have pour your own alcohol, they have a bar. Why? Law. The bar, its owner and its contractor (the airline) and indeed the bartenders themselves, are subject to the liquor licensing laws of the State in which the airport is located. If an alcohol related crime/incident can be traced back to that bar then the bar and even an individual bartender (if shown responsible) can face heavy fines (in my state $5000 per infraction for both bar and bartender) and ultimately revocation of their licenses. I've been in airline lounges - twice - and not been able to drink alcohol because the lounges lost their liquor license."
"Great idea. If I was ever in a incident where the plane needed to be evacuated, having to get out past noxious, dumb drunks could cost important time..No one needs to fly sh* tfaced2 standard drinks in the previous hour would likely keep you under a BAC of 0.05 which is deemed alert and aware enough to operate a motor vehicle in my state, so should be fine for evacuating a plane, but not spoil a bit of relaxed social consumption.."
"I have long thought a sensible restriction of 3 drinks purchased in-airport would be a good idea. The idea for me is that your boarding pass would have to be stamped every time you get one, however the problem with this is that people nowadays have boarding passes on their mobile phones, which is impossible to police really. I appreciate all the people who say ""but I drink x amount of alcohol at an airport and am fine"", I'm sure you are but a line has to be drawn somewhere. And I do think the airports encourage drinking. Last time I was at Manchester I ordered a beer at one of the bars in there and was asked if I wanted a stein for only £x amount extra... In my opinion, selling alcohol in that volume is asking for trouble. The airlines can be just as bad. I was once on an Emirates flight where a woman asked the crew to stop serving her wildly drunken (but very polite) husband alcohol. They agreed then served him again and again! Then during the initial descent he almost got into a fight with another drunken passenger. As he was sitting right behind us, we found this quite terrifying. All is well that ended well but I feel we were put in a dangerous situation."
"I would have no problem at all if alcohol was banned at airports and on board flights. I don't really understand why it is needed to be honest- you will have plenty of time to drink when you arrive at your holiday destination. I'm not sure I've ever consumed an alcoholic drink either at an airport or on a plane, but I'm a very light drinker so I do accept I'm in the minority there. But from a safety standpoint a total ban makes sense to me. I used to be cabin crew and having encountered drunken mile-high behaviour several times I suppose this colours my view of the issue. Not something I enjoyed dealing with. I once had a s***-faced bride to be try and climb over seats to attack my colleague as we refused to continue to serve the very drunk wedding party alcohol (all 70 of them. yep.).I do think the idea of 2 stamps on a boarding card is a good idea- the QR code could be scanned if you are using a mobile boarding pass. While it wouldn't eliminate the problem you can't deny it would help. Most pax would not arrive hours before a flight just to spend time getting smashed airside before they go through security. I'm not sure how that would affect lounges- I suppose they would have to get rid of the serve yourself bars and also keep to the 2 drink limit."
"Unfortunately, a 6am flight is no guarantee of sober fellow passengers in the UK. I remember an EasyJet flight from STN to AMS at that hour one Saturday morning a couple of years ago. It seemed like most of the other passengers had spent the night drinking before going straight to the airport for the middle of the night check in. It was a miserable experience for those of us who were sober.I think it does depend greatly on the routes you fly and what day of the week. The biggest offenders seem to travel out from the UK Thursday or Friday (or early Saturday morning) and back late on Sunday. There are also the people travelling for a week or fortnight who will go Saturday to Saturday or Sunday to Sunday. If you avoid these times, you are less likely to encounter drunks."
"Just had a thought about all those who say boarding passes should have a two or three spaces that you put a cross on each time you have an alcoholic drink, and once the spaces are full up, no more drink is allowed.What about those who have print at home boarding passes, who can then print multiple copies of their boarding pass, allowing them to bypass the drink limit?Only solution, I suppose, is to scan the boarding pass, whether it is paper or on a phone.Mind you, if there are some in a party who don't drink, the spaces on their boarding passes could then be used by those who want a drink."
"I don't drink alcohol before, during or immediately after any flight, so I have no particular personal reason to oppose any curbs on alochol sales or consumption.Indeed, I remember taking an early morning flight with soem friends, and I wa shorrified at their attitude towars drinking. Some had cans of lager on the minibus ot the airport at 0430 in the morning. Then they bought more drink before security, and continued again after security. By the time we reached our destination, some were pickled.At that time, I thought that there should be a ban on early morning sales of alcohol. I wasn't very comfortable with what was happening, and these were people I knew and was friendly with.I don't know what the answer is, but I suspect a mixture of some of the proposals that have bene made in this thread might be effective. I particularly like the idea of removing the licencing exemptions form airports and putitng them under the control of local authorities like everywhere else."
"Apparently the real problem is based in the UK with a yob based drinking culture?If so, crack down on the miscreants and leave the vast majority of other people alone."
If only it were limited to yobs.........
"IUnfortunately yobs will be yobs, whether drink involved or not."
"I don't think we need a sledgehammer to crack a nut here, just needs the rules to be made clear and some enforcement at the bars and at the gate.I think a timely reminder to noisy groups that they are on camera and will not be allowed to fly if anyone is deemed unfit to board will be sufficient to curb most of them before it gets out of hand. Signs at the bars and on the tables warning of the consequences of trying to board under the influence and stricter enforcement at the gates will get the message across to most.There will always be those who think the rules don't apply to them but these are the ones who should have the book thrown at them"
">>>crack down on the miscreants and leave the vast majority of other people alone.<<<Ah but, the vast majority of other people are someone elses miscreants, they are just not sober enough to realise . . . . ;-)"
<<Apparently the real problem is based in the UK with a yob based drinking culture?>>Bit of a sweeping generalisation there is it not - think spring break for North Americans - not exactly a sunday school picnic
">>>Apparently the real problem is based in the UK with a yob based drinking culture?<<<I don't think it;s yob based at all. In the story I related, the gents in question where allr espectable middle aged men wiht good incomes, and no history of yobbery. But the culture her eis that people will binge drink, and don't need much of an excuse to do so, whether it's a Friday night after work, setitng off ona trip, a day at the races, or whatever.The culture that relates having alcohol, and often to excess, in order to have a good time is what needs to be challenged and changed here in my view. That is obviously a long erm objective. In the here and now I would welcome airlines continuing to be stricter at the point of boarding, and I would not object to some sensible changes to alcohol and airports."
"How is raging alcoholism tolerated that much in the U.K. ?? It seems as if it should be treated the same as many other civilised countries. These aren't teens, these are full blown British adults who are attached to the bottle ? Is it the living conditions in the U.K. That drove them to drink ??"
"It's not raging alcoholism at all. People are not attached to the bottle, they have just become accustomed to drinking, and often drinking too much, in order to enjoy themselves.Hence, if someone is going to a football match, or a rugby match, the culture is to meet up somewhere before hand for a few, then have a couple more afterwards. Going on holiday, especially with a group of friends, seems to require a celkebration, too."
"Roj / I understand that and agree partially. But what you described that people feel the need to drink in excess to have a good time is the medical definition of alcoholism. Every culture defends it's unhealthy lifestyles. The yanks defend gluttony and obesity. The Japanese defend bizzare ""adult"" practices and the Brits defend alcoholism. I'm curious though, is this a socio-demographic? Do wealthy people drink as much as say middle tier people or minimum wage people ? They did a study in the US and found that tobacco use decreased significantly based on education level and income. The smartest and wealthiest people had a .4% smoking level while those who were at the bottom of intelligence and income had a 83% smoking level. Perhaps increase in alcoholism awareness ? But it sounds as if the alcohol industry is making a killing in sales in the U.K. So perhaps there would resistance from them.Edited: 3 years ago "
Having watched with horror the Plane Drunk Panorama last night (and wished fervently I hadn't in view of our forthcoming trip to Palma) I certainly think drinking should be curbed in some way but not sure how given Airports' lack of focus on the issue. OK they are in the business of making a lot of money and selling alcohol is extremely lucrative for them but a balance needs to be struck and let's hope there are no disasters caused through drunken antics ....
<<Is it the living conditions in the U.K. That drove them to drink??>>Such a strange thing to say – you could grow up in the wealthiest parts of the UK & still behave in this manner <<Do wealthy people drink as much as say middle tier people or minimum wage people?>>They sure do except their alcoholic drinks of choice are usually more expensive
Rampant alcoholism (lol) isn't limited to the UKibtimes.co.uk/alcoholism-epidemic-more-1-8-a…
"As far as I've always been aware, zenga, the definition of alcoholism concerns an individual becoming reliant on alcohol on a day to day basis. Binge drinking is a diferent matter. But then perhaps that's nto really the case, and if we treated everyone who went out once in a while and had more than four drinks at a stretch as alcoholics, htis might well lead to a change in UK cultural attitudes. Who knows? One thing I'm pretty sure about, though, is that airports aren't going to restrict alcohol sales on a voluntary basis. They will have to be forced to. And I think that's fair, since the vast majority of people can have a drink or three and not behave badly at all."
"Agree that binge drinking appears to be part of the problem.Once was in Punta Cana airport in the departures area watching a charter flight fly back to Glasgow. Let me tell you, that was quite the scene. Despite the fact these people had spent 2 weeks at all inclusives where you can drink all you want, a good section of them still seemed obsessed with drinking as much as is humanly possible prior to boarding that plane back home. Lot of them wandering around with large cans of lager purchased at airport stands.Hopefully many of them would fall asleep as soon as they got in board, but I would have hated to be the crew on that plane, and being a ""normal"" passenger would have been no fun either."

British alcohol consumption is definitely not correlated to income. Try going to a pub in the City of London (financial district) or Canary Wharf on a Thursday or Friday night and you will see multi-millionaire bankers drinking themselves into a stupour. It's the culture generally and is exacerbated by people going on holiday.Edited: 3 years ago 
I don't see why those routes/airlines that are particularly affected by binge drinkers (notably some of the low cost European city routes) should not have a compulsory breath test at the gate with a strict upper limit. This would not have to be as low as the drink-driving limit but would still give an idea of which passengers have already had a skinful before boarding. Over the limit - no boarding - simple. People would soon get the idea and moderate their consumption. I also enjoy the odd glass of champagne in the lounge before a flight but would be quite happy that this would not put me over the limit.
">>British alcohol consumption is definitely not correlated to income.

"@JahRas..Completely agree. Worst holiday I ever had was at an adults only location in Cuba where the Canadians were drunk at breakfast and instead of just taking the regular sized beers at the bars, they had brought these large bubble mugs.So binge drinking is not UK only..."
So the issue that the OP suggests was about excessive drinking which is a people issue not just a country x or y issue Why is this conversation going into nationalities and countries ? How does that help move this discussion forward except to make things personal?
"I agree, belomiser. The drinking culture in the UK or any other country has some relevance to the topic, but the topic itself is about restricting alcohol sales at UK airports. That's where the focus should be, not on comparisons between the residents of different countries and how much they drink."

"Mrs Grioud-have to agree with you on the Canadians in Cuba situation. Some of them are a disgrace.Less you pay in Cuba, the more likelihood of that happening. Bunch of yahoos sometimes."
At least at a resort you can call in police and security. Kind of hard to do once airbound.

"It sounds to me like Ryanair, et al are trying to get someone else to solve a problem they themselves are largely responsible for creating (I don't hear nearly as much about fighting drunks on BA fights to Spain,Prague, Riga, etc. ), and that doing more about it themselves (not serving alcohol on flights, screening people before boarding) risks killing the goose that lays the golden eggs (lots of money from el cheapo flights to el cheapo destinations, not to mention all the money from selling on board booze to the el cheapo travelers)."
"Bingo, exactly what I was thinking..."
For anyone in the U.K. - flights from hell: caught on camera is currently on channel 4 and it's not a lot of drunk Brits I'm seeing! A proper mix of nationalities.
Yes not just us Brits after all
Watching it at the moment!
It's not rampant in my circle of friends.
My visits to Prague were on Czech Airlines. At least one involved seriously drunk stag parties sharing my flight home :(
"I see some potential issues.Take a 4 hr layover, for us at SFO.We arrive, and go to UA Club, where we have 2 ""Premium Wines,"" per each, then head down toward T3 Gate 86, and as boarding is still some hours away, we stop into SFUncork'd, and slowly have two more glasses of wine each.Obviously, specific example, and not in UK, but think in a similar nature.Hunt"
"The points made by QQ2 mirror what I was thinking. Surely it is the airlines who apparently are notorious for party flights to party destinations and attracting groups of guzzlers who should police themselves and their clients, rather than imposing across-the-board restrictions. Of course any flight to anywhere can have a disgusting drunk, but why not focus on where the main problem is?"

"Well no offence, but perhaps someone whose avatar picture is a picture of drinking alcohol may not be the most unbiased?"
#85 - agree as to the first paragraph. Some people simply aren't able to mask pretended dumbness and humbleness for DYKWIA
Well I love a good few drinks with the best of them but I've flown out early morning from gatwick twice this year and am still stunned at the number of pints being consumed with breakfast at 0630. Really!!! Never seen that before Spoils the eggs on toast !!!Terry
"jamanetwork.com/journals/…2647075From the Journal of the American Medical Association-Psychiatry about the marked increase in alcohol use disorder in the USA. This, of course, is a public health concern. But I post it here not for that reason but to note, and agree with previous posters, that excess drinking and problems with drinking are not limited to any one nationality. I have not routinely been on European LCCs, though I had one experience with Ryanair. (: I have little doubt that certain routes may have more problems than others. Certain times of the year may engender issues; the point about US spring break is well taken. Residents of several large cities in the US who live in neighborhoods with popular bars do have issues with drunks misbehaving, urinating etc. and have complained to the city fathers about these issues. I had the dis-pleasure of being in a Derry hotel taken over by the drunk guests from a wedding to such a degree that the cops were called several times, we could not sleep and I had my room charge refunded. Then again, I was on a business trip when the large US city hotel I was in was overrun by drunk high schoolers after their prom to such a degree the staff and several guests called 911.So no, it is not limited to any nationality. But it would be good if the airlines could find a consistent approach to curb the most egregious behavior in the terminal and in flight."
"I've just watched the Panorama program via the BBC iPlayer. Very enlightening. It's clear that the retailers at some airports are abusing the loophole that alcohol is not subject to licensing regulations airside at airports. In one scene the reporter flies out of MAN and checks all the retail outlets selling alcohol. They include - - Starbucks- Upper Crust (a sandwich store)- Burger King- The Pasty ShopAnd the duty free store is offering huge discounts on minatures. Why would you buy minatures (by volume much more expensive than liter/quart bottles) at a duty free store for anything other than drinking on the plane? As QQ2 says above, the airlines (with one exception, Jet2 who has a partial alcohol ban) happily sell alcohol on their flights and point the finger at the retailers. And the representative of the airports played ""not me guv"". They only provide the alcohol, it's what people do with it that's wrong. And seeing as you can't do much else than drink it their argument falls to the ground. Any airport that did that in the US would have all liquor banned and the airport management would be facing charges. Action is needed, and the only way that will happen is by regulation. And there are plenty of things that can be regulated/banned without stopping responsible people from enjoying a nice pre-departure drink."
"I really resent that Zegna. I'm British and personally don't have an alcohol problem - I have a couple of drinks per week max. Neither do any of the people I fly with. On all of the flights I've taken the only ""rowdy"" one was on EasyJet to Malia when I was 18 - the majority of disruption on a plane is for Low Cost Carriers who are by and large more than happy to sell alcohol on board. Do not tar an entire nation with one brush please. I find most of your comments on this thread completely offensive."

"Seeing that it's the troll (Zegna_man) that's calling for the thread to be shut down, I say no. Just shut down the troll. There are genuine differences of opinion on what can/should be done, and they should be focused on the issue in hand, namely the issues contributing to alcohol abuse at UK airports and on certain flights from those airports."

"USBthe question for me is: Is the airline more concerned with the people getting unruly because of drinking or more concerned that they cannot make profit with selling alcohol to people as they are already halfway or more drunk once they board?If Ryanair really wnats to reduce drunk people on board the first logical step would be to stop selling it and then(!) ask others to give up their profit, not the other way around."
Zenga man don't ever come to Australia if you think the English have a drinking problem. You will think that all of us need help To be honest I have only noticed one bar at Sydney Airport ( surely there must be more) so do people go to a bar or is it the Airlines clubs they drink at. Just wondering. PS I like Bill from AZ
"""Is the airline more concerned with the people getting unruly because of drinking or more concerned that they cannot make profit with selling alcohol""Needing to divert an aircraft because people onboard need to be offloaded is the worst case scenario due to the massive costs and delays incurred. The next step down from that is having to refuse boarding to someone who is intoxicated, if they have checked bags it takes time to unload them which is also at a cost. The small amount made from selling alcohol onboard (I think they make £100 or so per flight) doesn't even come close to the costs of interruptions."
Zegna likes nothing more than to upset people. Best to ignore him.
"@JahRastafari... of course I'd expect a Scot to h ave nothing but neat whiskey in that mug, lolI'm just suprised that the troll is only picking on the British. Really thought he'd have picked on us IrishI think the point most people are making is that it’s ok to drink before you fly, it’s ok to drink on the plane, it’s ok to buy duty free (and NOT drink that)… but anyone that is partaking in a tipple will know their limits and once they are not drunk or a nuisance to others, then let them bep.s. that programme last night was interesting. I felt sorry for the poor guy with Tourettes!"
"When you see me drinking in the airport at 6am it is not beer with my breakfast as I will have been up for around 6 hours by then so to my body it's late lunchtime. Drinking at that time used to be ""just because we can"" as it was a novelty back in the old days. Now it's a pleasant way to pass the hours chatting over a beer or two whilst we wait to be called to the gate"
"MrsGiroudAll very true<<p.s. that programme last night was interesting. I felt sorry for the poor guy with Tourettes!>>Yeah must be pretty bad especially when flying makes him worse but fair play to the fella for not letting his condition rule his lifeIt would be good if some of our North American cousins would watch that programme, so they can see for themselves, exactly how some of their fellow countrymen/women behave whilst intoxicated AliNottsUKAgain very true – as long as it’s in moderation – but does that make you a rampant alcoholic or are you just in denial???? - LOL"
"AliNottsUK ""When you see me drinking in the airport at 6am it is not beer with my breakfast as I will have been up for around 6 hours by then so to my body it's late lunchtime""Fair point and even though my airport treat is a nice coffee and cake I don't have any problem with anyone drinking at whatever time of the day. Do like to have my first drink of the holiday on the plane though so don't think it would be fair if it was banned and people like me would be affected.Watching both programs has really opened my eyes and have luckily never been in a flight where there has been anyone so drunk and rowdy.I really think the airport's should take some responsibility. There is no need to sell the miniatures which are totally aimed at people wanting to drink them on the plane, or the large jugs of beer or even outlets like The Pasty Shop to sell alcohol. But also, it's no use the airlines complaining but then allowing people who are worse for wear onto the plane. I appreciate if they was off loaded it could cause a delay but would guess a lot who are drunk like on the stag & hen parties don't travel with checked in baggage anyway. I would much rather have a little delay than be on a flight like the ones on both programsEdited: 3 years ago "
"My doctor says an alcoholic is someone who drinks more than him, his prescription for sleepless nights is to have a tot of whisky before bed.With regards to buying miniatures at the airport I bought them not to drink on the plane but to use in lieu of a hipflask when travelling to Iceland - very nice they were too when standing around waiting for the northern lights to show, fair warmed me cockles as they say"
"it was noticeable in the tv programme last night, that most of the scenes of drunken yobboes were on ryanair aircraft!but mention of the poor lad with tourettes, did anybody notice where he was sitting?......at the emergency exit ! there is supposed to be an able bodied person at the exit and i doubt that the lad would have complied with the requirement."
"nakagoli<<but mention of the poor lad with Tourette’s, did anybody notice where he was sitting?......at the emergency exit ! There is supposed to be an able bodied person at the exit and I doubt that the lad would have complied with the requirement>>Why would you say that, he has Tourette’s – he looks perfectly able bodied & not disabled in anyway, not that I saw and he seemed to be walking just fine through the airportStrange and slightly offensive thing to say"
"that is in no way offensive! just an observation that a person with a handicap, no matter how slight, would not be deemed to be an able bodied person and capable of opening the emergency exit. tourettes also includes involuntary body movements which could hamper him opening the door or else cause it to malfunction.oh and by the way, i do have a special needs grand daughter so i would never post an offensive or demeaning comment about a person with special needs!further, i was walking with a retired airline safety officer today, (and i myself am a retired h and s inspector!) and he was also of the opinion that the boy should not have been seated there!"
nakagoli your posts are about as useful as zegna-mans.
yours is even less useful! at least mine was on topic about ryanair and drinks.
"I might be missing something here so apologies if I am. People have suggested banning sale of alcohol before 8am or even 10 am on flights ( jet2 are doing that) ,or not serving alcohol before a certain time in airport terminals. This seems the wrong way around to me. Anybody flying during the afternoon/ early evening has hours and hours to get tanked up and then carry on drinking once they board the aircraft ( alcohol ban only applies early mornings?). They can also drink in pubs prior to entering the airport. Why are those on early flights being targeted as the ones who should be restricted, isn't that discrimination by the airlines such as jet2 and what is the explanation for it? What about those who have been boozing all day in resort and are catching the evening flights home are jet2/ Ryanair etc banning alcohol sales on those flight also??"
"so so many ways to get around the rules. drink limit of . . . . 2? My husband or boozer of a friend & ex flight surgeon would have been smooching off my 2 allowances, as usual."
"Always an interesting topic, with somewhat polarized views, and usually some stereotyping, in the course.Now, if you see me having a glass of Champagne, in the Lounge, and it seems very early, consider that I might have been flying for 20 hrs, by that time.In Australia, I started flying 24 hrs, and two ""days"" before, so my internal clock, might well be on a different time zone/date?Now, as I am a ""trained professional,"" I cannot imagine that the Champagne will show any noticeable effects - or it certainly should not.When we are sitting in Exit Rows, even with free booze, we decline, and order sparkling water, instead.Just my observations,Hunt"
"+ 1 to the comments in reply #111 by ReedRover.I watched the Panorama programme last night.I thought a lot of it was sloppy journalism with an outcome in mind and they set out to ""prove the facts"".Some misconceptions - the Baroness talked about airports post Security not being subject to the same licencing laws that other pubs are.Did we not have 24 hour drinking laws introduced in November 2005 in the UK?Yes we did:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34881193So the airports are exercising the law to the full whilst most pubs don't.But the law IS THE SAME.The reporter expressed shock that they were serving 'free shots' in the duty free.I've seen this - they aren't 'shots', dear, they're a tiny bit in the bottom of a plastic glass as a taster.You'd need to be really desperate to get drunk on that. The reporter asked about the miniatures - she was clearly told that she couldn't drink them on the plane then expressed shock (to the camera, of course) that they weren't in a sealed bag.Did she really think that a sealed bag would deter someone who'd bought them to drink on the plane.The guy who told her that 'unofficially she'd get away with it' should be discliplined though.The Virgin ex-cabin crew who said she'd been sexually harassed and said she'd only realised after she'd resigned that she didn't tell the Police.Well, when I was employed, if I'd been subjected to a sexual attack, I'd have told my immediate supervisor.There are clearly problems with some people drinking to excess and that needs addressing but stopping the passenger who wants to have a drink or 2, either at the airport or on the plane, is using the proverbial sledgehammer to to crack the nut.The women causing problems on the Antalya flight ex MAN that had to divert to Stansted were not banned from flying, despite costing the airline £thousands.Why don't airlines ban these people for life?Is this too radical a view?"
"Did we not have 24 hour drinking laws introduced in November 2005 in the UK? Yes we did:So the airports are exercising the law to the full whilst most pubs don't. But the law IS THE SAME.=======Er no.While UK law (stupidly IMO, blame Tony Blair who introduced it) does allow premises to sell alcohol 24 hours a day, they are still subject to licensing laws. It's not a free for all. They can only sell alcohol when local authorities permit it, and those authorities can revoke the license when there's trouble.Airports airside are (even more stupidly) exempt from those local authority licensing laws.So the law is NOT THE SAME.Edited: 3 years ago "
"PrettypollycatAgree with what you say about the Panorama programmeIt was almost laughable the way the reporter ‘reacted’ to the serving of the ‘shots’ at the airport – you would almost think that she had never been in an airport before – such a common sight in an airport And as for the ‘sealed/unsealed’ bag – really!!! – she obviously thinks that the seal on the bag would make it impossible to open before getting onto the plane let alone once on itIt wouldn’t take the mind of a genius to get your sealed bag of miniatures and open it to be the said miniatures into your hand luggage before getting onto the plane – if you were that way inclined<<Why don't airlines ban these people for life?Is this too radical a view?>>That is something that I would advocate – so not radical in my view but others may disagree of course which they are perfectly entitled to doI believe if the practice of banning unruly, disruptive passengers who cause a flight to be diverted (and the associate costs passed onto them) was actually put in place by the airlines then this behaviour would certainly stopBut then again I could be wrong of course"
"It was almost laughable the way the reporter ‘reacted’ to the serving of the ‘shots’ at the airport – you would almost think that she had never been in an airport before – such a common sight in an airport.==================Such a common sight where? In the UK it's blindingly obvious why (to illicit alcohol sales). You would NEVER see that in the US because it's banned by law. And I've never seen that at any airport I've flown through, including Heathrow. That speaks volumes to the targets for those ""shots"".Edited: 3 years ago "
"<<And I've never seen that at any airport I've flown through, including Heathrow. That speaks volumes to the targets for those ""shots"">>Maybe not at Heathrow (never been so can't comment) but at other airports, Manchester, Gatwick etc, they are there.and they aren't 'shots' per say they are more like a dribble of alcohol"
"Watched the Panorama program last night, and while I agreed with some of the points in it, the above posts about the 'free shots' are spot on. She was just being silly and over reacting. They are not 'shots', they are dribbles, and they aren't going to let you start downing a whole row of them. Like said above, has she never been in an airport before? I recently had one or two tasters in Palma airport before my flight (trying to decide on a bottle to bring back as a gift). So it's certainly not just in the UK.However, I think the minatures are another kettle of fish. Why would you buy them unless to drink them on the plane? They aren't a cost effective way to buy alcohol, so clearly they are designed for immediate consumption. They are much easier to conceal than drinking a large 70cl bottle on board, as the plane often sells exactly the same thing. Makes it much harder for crew to monitor how much people are drinking on board.Edited: 3 years ago "
"It must be pretty awful if you are in the middle of a bunch of drunks on a plane. However airport alcohol sales probably generate significant income so any attempt to either ban or limit those sales is unlikely, even if such was workable.I have travelled a bit and the only time I have been aware of any alcohol related disruption was on a Virgin Atlantic flight back to Gatwick from Grenada a few years ago. This did a stop at Tobago and a couple got on who had apparently been enjoying themselves rather well in the airport bar. Our captain decided that they could travel on the flight but that they would not be served or consume any more alcohol.That this did not suit them led to him announcing ""a couple of our passengers have decided that they no longer want to fly with us"".They and their luggage were removed from the plane. He later said that they would be banned from future Virgin Atlantic flights and that VS would seek compensation from them for any costs resulting from the disruption caused. I hope that both of those happened.Edited: 3 years ago "

"Some very interesting comments, observations and solutions, and not one on my own line of thinking. It seems it is mostly someone else's fault, the barman, the duty free shop, security, the gate, or even Ryanair & Jet2 for selling cheap flights (sheesht) - would that not really make all this Freddy Lakers fault? I see it two fold, It's a criminal offence to fly under the influence, just as it is to drive, whether disruptive or otherwise it's not someone else's fault and they're getting ready to crack down on it.The awareness this has brought (panorama & press) was orchestrated and in my view by authorities & government, or at least with their vocal approval, for the sole purpose of public support for action on the agenda - imminent action IMO. Namely before next summer holidays.My solution varies but in essence a “points system for passports” just like a speeding offence on your licence, a yellow card if you like for misdemeanours, and a red for diversions or violence. Coupled with licencing laws for airports, perhaps restrictions on goods for sale, and all edged in gently and stepped up at 4-5 year intervals, following precedent of speeding, drink driving and many others.Leading, of course, to a total ban on alchohol at airports and in flight over 20- 25 years."
"I think we need to get things into perspective. The Panorama programme was typical of the lazy journalistic standards now prevalent at the BBC, with no real attempt to delve behind the headlines.The whole thing was based on a reported increase in the number of ARRESTS for drunken behaviour, with no mention of the CAA statement that ""the increase is partly down to improved reporting of incidents"". There was an almost throwaway comment that there's also a problem with Germans.Maybe they should have looked at incidents of drunkenness against the background of total number of passengers flown, & how much of a contribution alcohol sales make to airports' overall income & what this represents on a per flight/passenger basis.I'm not in any way denying that there is a problem & that it does appear to be on the increase, but in terms of numbers of arrests, denied boarding, etc, how much of the increase is down to the airlines' (rightly) lowered tolerance of such behaviour & increased willingness to involve the police can only be a matter of conjecture.As for the proposed remedies, some of them would be very expensive to implement, some would place undue responsibility on low-paid employees, some would impinge on individuals' freedom. It's always difficult in such situations to weigh up the balance between cost & benefit.Sadly the only answer I can see is a change in social attitudes, which will take a long time.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Considering there are still people out there who don't think driving drunk is an issue, trying to get people to understand that flying drunk is not such a great idea is not going to resonate with an awful lot of people. That said, how do half these guys not get their pockets picked by every pickpocket in Europe?"
"Here's a thought:The journalist expressed shock at people drinking at 6am.Would she have felt the same shock if she'd have been in the airport bar at midday or 3pm or 6pm?If I fly from LHR or LGW, I will have been up for 4 or 5 hours by the time I arrive at the airport.So if my flight is at 8am, that drink at 6am is no different from me getting up at 8am and going for a lunchtime drink of wine.@ Dave B (reply #123) - I'm glad I'm not the only one with the opinion about sloppy, lazy journalism.@ JockbossBob (reply #124) - I agree that penalties/sentences for this minority of people who cannot control themselves are not sufficient - or maybe maximum sentences are not being handed down.As a number of posters have suggested, cancel their return ticket. Put them on a banned list.It would circulate via social media like wildfire and may just deter those people who have more than one brain cell which clearly goes AWOL at the sniff of the barmaid's apron."
"This isn't about Panorama, it's been escalating for years. Over 3 years ago Monarch ran a pilot trial with the police at LGW to reduce disruption, with results. 2 years ago Ryanair banned alchohol on certain routes, last year Jet 2 banned alchohol before 8am and public polls were at 85% in favour. The issue was Monarchs pilot scheme -telegraph.co.uk/travel/…And Dave - it was you yourself that started the 2015 thread about Jet2 banning 450 passengers, that's not lazy jouralism, that's trying to do something right by the vast majority and deliver a safer travelenvironment.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i…edit - meant to add a load of links from 2016https:/…78304872Edited: 3 years ago "
"I think it's a very touchy point. I don't drink on flights myself, but I've no objection (nor should I have) to those who want to enjoy a drink on or before a flight. That said, however, watching a group of young men at Leeds/Bradford necking as many pints as they can before boarding - at 6:30am! - is a bit disconcerting. And they were in a group - stag, or just lad's weekend away, perhaps - but the group dynamic seemed to be a part of it. (""Gerrit down yoursen! Then we'll have time for another...."")But it's not just airports and aircraft. Earlier this year I had an awful three-and-a-half hour train ride from Inverness to Edinburgh with a hen party in the carriage. Music on - check! Singing along - check! Lots of bottles of beer and wine - double check!! By the time we reached Edinburgh they were very noisy indeed and some were getting abusive. They had zero consideration for their fellow passengers. I think that's the real issue here, whether it be air passengers or whatever - they put their desire for a Good Time well ahead of everyone's desire for a pleasant flight/journey."
TomB--are there no train staff personal to take care of those kind of issues? I would think in most countries a conductor would be called and the situation would be taken in hand.
"The train conductor was simply interested in checking tickets.Once he'd done that, he beat a hasty retreat....Don't get me wrong - there was no actual trouble (i.e. violence), just a huge volume of noise and a very unrelaxing experience. The girls were shouting to each other down the carriage, and singing, and drinking, and the abusive comments were 'friendly abuse' directed at each other and about other women who they knew and were going to meet - all at the tops of their voices (to be heard over the music). But no-one was prepared to complain.Again, I felt that the group members - the hen-party, in this instance - were perhaps behaving in way that probably they wouldn't if they were individually on their own. And this was mid-morning - by the time the train reached Waverley several of them were well sloshed."
"<<And Dave - it was you yourself that started the 2015 thread about Jet2 banning 450 passengers, that's not lazy jouralism, that's trying to do something right by the vast majority and deliver a safer travelenvironment>>@JockBossBob - the lazy & sloppy journalism that Dave B and I are referring to is not the subject matter (i.e. the fact that SOME people can't be trusted not to get p*ssed at an airport or on a plane or the action taken by anybody to try to stop it (i.e. Jet2 banning 450 pax) - it's about how so-called investigative journalists slant what they are presenting to fit a pre-decided outcome."
"From your post >>>to fit a pre-decided outcome. <<<And from my post >>> was orchestrated and in my view by authorities & government<<<We're saying the same thing here, and it has been presented as such for a purpose. ;-))"
"JockBossBobIt was your comment that it wasn't lazy journalism that I disagreed with.Poorly researched, poorly presented."
"My goodness gracious -- that post in #127 about the 3-1/2 hour train ride with a hen party on board really threw me for a loop. Never even thought of the possibility of something like that on a train. That incident made me think about the ""quiet cars"" some suburban rail lines out of NYC have added where there is no loud talking,no phone calls, no buzzing earphones, no noisy use of laptops or other electronic devices, etc. allowed. They have proved so popular some lines are now having two such cars on each run, instead of just one. Then that in turn reminded me of a policy some US air carriers had way back in the 70s where there was a separate coach section called ""the quiet zone."" This was on jumbo jets when there was just first class and coach. On some of those aircraft, like the 747 I think, there was a forward coach section that was separate from the rest of coach, and that was the ""quiet zone"" (I particularly recall this on transcontinental flights on United). Of course, they later used that cabin for the new business class, and that was the end of the quiet zone. But maybe it's an option whose time has returned. Even if there's not a separate cabin available, they could designate a portion of the cabin they do have for a quiet zone -- no loud talking, no buzzing earbuds,no crying kids. That would presumably not appeal to heavy drinkers prone to shouting about how much they were enjoying their drinks."
"It's a typical BBC non story, 300 odd arrests out of how many million passengers travelled.If there were stricter enforcement of stopping already drunk people getting on a plane that would help (Obviously the problem is different when people get drunk on the flight)Statistically, almost all people behave responsibly.The courts should hand out sentences that act as deterrents and allow normal people who enjoy a holiday drink to do so."
">>>My goodness gracious -- that post in #127 about the 3-1/2 hour train ride with a hen party on board really threw me for a loop. Never even thought of the possibility of something like that on a train.<<<This is not at all uncommon on trains in the UK. I was surprised by the amount of drinking that took place on a morning Saturday train from South Wales to London. There were slabs of beer, boxes of wine all being consumed with vigour. It turned ou that those partying were heading to the races at Ascot foir the racing. As if the outfits and hats weren't a give away, when we got off at Reaidng to change trains for Gatwick, they all headed for the Ascot train, with many having to ask for directions.But this topic is about flights and airports. While I agree that this isn't a major problem, I do feel that it needs addressing, both in the long term by changing attitudes, and in the shorter term.I support stricter enforcement of not allowing drunken passengers to board the aircraft. I support restrictions on licencing for airport premises. Yet I don't want to prevent the well behaved majority enjoying a drink if they want one (or two), nor do I want to ban drinking alcohol entirely.There's a balance to be found, and I don't think it's the right balance that we have at the moment."
"Tuesday 15th August on C4 ""Flights from Hell"" (watch on catch up) put a whole new perspective on drunks on aircraft with many of the incidents featuring flights in US and Canada and within EuropeThis is not just a UK problem,I am glad I was not a passenger as some of the drunken acts and violence would have me hiding,crouched,behind my seat backSS"
Yes the Flights From Hell programme certainly shed some passengers in a new light and it is an issue without borders so to speakAdmittedly some of the antics where in good homour but the fighting & incidents with police officers were eye openingThankfully we weren't on any of thosee flights
Thankfully we weren't on any of thosee flightsThat should have been those flights - my bad
"I thought the 'Flights from Hell' programme was a mish-mash of 'horror stories', not all of which were drink-related.It featured a flight that was going to put down in the water then landed OK - nothing to do with alcohol.It showed a group of Chinese/Japanese physically fighting in the cabin - no idea whether than was alcohol related or not.It showed the guy with Tourettes - he shouts 'bomb' and 'I'm a terrorist' and 'AK47 in my back pocket ' - I'm sure that must be very disconcerting for some passengers.It showed clips of people a*sing about on luggage carousels.It even showed the David Dao incident.The most shocking thing was the narrative of a flight from UK to Nairobi obviously years ago that apparently resulted in flight deck doors being locked thereafter.A passenger got onto the flight deck and grabbed the controls.He was subdued when the Captain (resting in his bunk at the time) pushed his middle finger into the guy's eye.I wouldn't be at all surprised if C4 jumped on the 'problem flights' bandwagon and scheduled this to coincide with the BBC Panorama programme."
"I won't watch anything with such a title as 'xxxx from hell'! Given the number of flights operating around the world, and the number of passengers that have flown over the last few decades, I'm not at all surprised that there have been some weird, dangerous, and downright terrifying incidents along the way.Just like incidents with alcohol, the number of these must be statistically very small indeed."
My OH voted with his feet a quarter of the way through.It was the right choice. ;0)
"there is another programme (channel 4) about southwestern airlines on at present. every episode seems to show inebriated people trying to get on flights and , to their credit, swa staff refuse boarding, much to the chagrin of the passenger!"
">>>I wouldn't be at all surprised if C4 jumped on the 'problem flights' bandwagon and scheduled this to coincide with the BBC Panorama programme.<<<Or, exactly as I implied in post #122 and 18months ago during the last spate -- that it was (is) all orchestrated by authority to heighten awareness prior to remedies being announced. 3 programs in one week is orchestrated by someone, and it's being done for a purpose.Roll on our TT flights and airports . . . . . [whoop whoop} Coming to a town near you sooooooon :D :D :D"
I can never see alcohol being banned on flights anywhere!
"Manchester airport is my regular haunt so I'm quite familiar with the place.I see many people drinking at 4am; not my thing TBH, but who am I to judge ?If I'm on a midday or late flight then I will have a drink with lunch or dinner.Alcohol should not be banned in airports, if people do not approve of alcohol then they shouldn't drink. Ban trouble makers, not alcohol."
"Hear, hear, for the last sentence in Rick's post, #145!Well stated,Hunt"
I think that a lengthy flying ban for toruble makers could work as a deterrent.
I second what the esteemed Mr Hunt wrote at 146..And I am already looking forward to a couple of glasses of champagne with my full English breakfast at 7am in the VS Clubhouse in the not too distant future.
"I used to enjoy my early morning brandy and coke for breakfast Gosh what repel I was so cheers to you "" Grumpyoldchap "" wish I still could and I agree ""Ban trouble makers, not alcohol ¬"
"As it's wine o'clock here, I decided (between slurps) to read this whole thread from the beginning. Facinating stuff! Like some of you, I've watched some of the TV programmes about the perils of airport drinking, but frankly, I thought they were long on faux shock and short on real facts. Those teeny wee samples of freebies wouldn't have pickled a gherkin. The coffee/pasty/sandwich shops selling minature bottles? ....Given that the food & beverage offerings on Ryanair are expensive and vile tasting, I'm not suprised people want to make up their own airbourne picnics. Restricting opening hours? That won't stop drunks on mid day, afternoon or evening flights. Nor those that arrive at the airport already drunk.Given the very high number of visible security staff and police at all UK airports, wouldn't it make more sense to prevent drunks from even getting to the gate...much less actually boarding a flight? As prevention is better than cure, surely there are better ways of warning passngers that drunks will not be allowed to board flights. Currently airports & check in desks provide plenty of signage about knives, batteries, and 100ml liquids. Perhaps they can come up with international signage for a drunk? Personally, I couldn't even look at a wine cork for a 7 am flight. But if someone else enjoys a glass of bubbly with their toast and marmite, well, that's up to them. Why punish millions of passengers for the sake of a few obnoxious idiots, when there are simple solutions. Right... back to my wine!"
"What a lovely description "" airbourne picnics "" sounds far more fun than a bottle of water , a filled role and bag of crisps in three weeks time I will be tucking into my airbourne picnic :)"
"It seems to me that if boarding an aircraft while drunk is already a crime, then it just need to be enforced. This could be done by:-defining a blood alcohol level that constitutes ""drunk"" for the purposes of the law-performing breathalyser tests on a selection of passengers at boarding (could be random or based on factors such as time of day, day of the week, destination, alert from the airline about large, single-sex groups on board etc.)-arresting people whose BAC was higher than the defined level, cancelling their tickets and doing whatever else is allowed by the law-publicising this to deter others from boarding drunk Then people who want to have a responsible drink or two can do so but unpleasantly drunk people will have the risk of being stopped (and losing lots of money and/or their holiday), which would hopefully reverse some of the social pressure on nice but (currently) thoughtless people."
I don't disagree with those suggestions at all. My concern is whether airlines and airports have the will to do it without legislation forcing them to?
"I'd be concerned for the safety of gate staff who try to tell a tanked-up stag party group (or possibly even worse, a hen party) that they are too drunk to board the plane.On the Flights from Hell programme, someone angry about lack of information about a delay slapped an airline representative around the head."
"I can see that having to increase security to deal with such incidents would be a massive disincentive to doing it voluntarily. Compulsion would have a financial impact, which would not doubt be passed on to passengers."
"An interesting quote :- ""Entering an aircraft when drunk or being drunk on an aircraft is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment ""and the sooner they start imposing those laws, handing out deterent sentences, and banning alchohol on flights, the safer we will all be.>Let's hope the airlines and whoever in charge impose that on drunk flight crew too."
"A really determined drinker is going to find a way. My sister and brother-in-law were on a Southwest flight and were enjoying the fact that the middle seat was empty when a flight attendant came up and said that she was going to have to move someone into that seat. A passenger had grabbed a fistful of booze bottled and drank them then got belligerent, so they were moving passengers around the drunk away. They came thisclose to having to do an emergency landing-which would have sucked for my brother-in-law as he was already running late to a meeting (weather delay) he had to be at.Luckily they made it, landed, and noted airport police waiting as they disembarked."
"Interesting point, I watched a guy reach into the beverage trolley and swipe a handful of miniatures while the FA was distracted with someone else. It is wide open and available if only one FA is serving from the other side...."
">>>Let's hope the airlines and whoever in charge impose that on drunk flight crew too.<<<If you're referring to the UA crew at GLA . . . . it was just the 10 months - but hey, they hadn't taken off yet. ;-)https:/…And airbourne picnics are far better when prepared at home, so I'll stick with my home made rice pudding, thanks. I'm curious, as those departure lounge pasty/sandwich shops are most probably using exactly the same airport catering, why they would taste any different to an airlines offering? hmmm"
"Determined drinkers will always find a way, yes, but measures to try and discourage the 'social drinkers' from having too much out of a sense of excitement or (maybe even nerves?) are what I want."
"Reading the posts on this string I feel very fortunate, or perhaps I'm just oblivious, in that I can't recall ever having encountered a drunk, obnoxious or otherwise, on a flight. I had elite status with three airlines at various times and while I currently fly less than 30,000 miles a year before I retired I often did 100,000."
"They seem to be mainly on certain flights. I wonder if it's the increase in low cost flights to party destinations. After all, probably a lot of those people would have stayed and gotten drunk in the UK instead if it was expensive to fly. I could see it happening on spring break flights here except it's harder here as most people going on spring break are still underage in the US."
"JstHouston,I am with you, though on a WN flight, a few years ago, did have a young man pass out, on her shoulder. His last comment was ""You remind me of my mother."" At least he did not say ""grandmother!"" In this case, he was a young solder, shipping out for Afghanistan, so my wife cut him a bunch of slack.OTOH, we seldom fly routes, which are popular with the ""drunken holiday crowd,"" so not surprising that we have been pretty fortunate.Some routes DO seem more prone to loud drunks.Flay safely,Hunt"
It's cheap flights to places where it is inexpensive to party.
"Yes, I think you're spot on QQ2. I tend not to fly to such places very often, if at all, so I'm fortunate in not having had many experiences with drunken idiots. Even when I've flown to what are, or at least were at the time, popular stag and hen destinations such as Prague and Amsterdam, I haven't really noticed anything bad happening.I think that the issue has been a bit overblown by the media, but I still believe that there is an issue here, however minor staistically, that needs to be addressed in some way."
"Here's a very interesting arricle in Airways Magazine regarding the subject (and it references the BBC program). airwaysmag.com/paxexx/…What's very interesting is the number of unruly passengers reported for the UK and US. ""Its proposal came in the wake of a BBC report that found a major rise in drunken incidents on board UK airliners, with 387 people arrested in the year to February 2017 compared to 255 in the preceding 12 months."""".... FAA statistics show a high-water mark of 310 ‘unruly passenger’ incidents in 2004; ever since then, the trend has been steadily downwards. In 2015, it was 105; in 2016, 97; and halfway through this year, it was a remarkably low 22.""387 arrests in the UK, and only 97 unruly passenger incidents in the US for essentially the same period.Edited: 3 years ago "
Apologies for the link to the Express but I can't find another source right now:express.co.uk/news/uk/843689/drunk-law-tutor…Goes to show that deomographics and destinations aren't a factor in every case and BA has banned her for 2 years on top of the £4500 fine ... and the loss of the ticket she was traveliing on I guess.Edited: 3 years ago 
Love the different opinions:From her solicitor:<<it was “an absolutely tragic case”.>>From the judge:<<“Your behaviour was disgraceful.”>>I know who I agree with. ;0)No idea what is tragic about getting drunk and abusing people who are just doing their job as far as this woman is concerned. It was reprehensible behaviour with no excuse.I'd like to see more of this action against these sorts of people.
I'm not sure what worries me more about that Daily Brexpress link - the story or the comments.. . . & does BA use A319s on transatlantic flights?
Lordy! Lordy!Some really dreadful ill-informed comments.
">>>& does BA use A319s on transatlantic flights?<<<Yes - BA 3 LCY-JFK it's an all business class configuration that has a fuel stop at SNN, which allows for pre clearance."
"The BA 3/4 rotation no longer exists ... it was basically killed off by Shannon pre-clearance reducing their hours. BA1/2 still does LCY-SNN-JFK-LCY operated by a A318 - the other 318 is now painted all white, there is a photo online somewhere."
