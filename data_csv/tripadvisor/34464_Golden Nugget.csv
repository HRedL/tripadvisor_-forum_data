Has anyone seen any info as to how they will be handling the pools at the hotels? I can't imagine how they will allow guests in the Golden Nugget pool since the chairs are lined up so close and there is not much area to move spread them out.
"The pool experience will never be the same at the Golden Nugget, or at any other property for a very long time."
"Honestly, I think social spacing at their pool will be an improvement. Being crammed in like sardines and having strangers so close to each other always sucked. And yes, Vegas pools will never be the same again."
"What happens if you're in the water and someone swims or floats too close - do you all have to move together??Edited: 11:03 am, May 30, 2020 "

I agree the chairs at their pool were ridiculous. Anything would be an improvement
"If it's like other properties, they will remove a lot of loungers and limit the number of people in at any time."
A place like Bellagio will have little trouble with the pool area. I see it as a positive for the Nugget.If still distancing when Mirage opens it will be a huge improvement.
I always hung upstairs at the Hideout anyway. Get rid of all the loungers and just go with daybeds. Make sure there’s enough chlorine in the pools and crank up the heat in the hot tub to help kill all those nasty germs.
I never went to the hideout pool. I couldn’t see paying for a chair at the pool when I already paid for a room and a resort fee. They have a promo on if you book by July 31 no resort fee till the end of the year
"If I was 11, I’d love the lower pool. But as an adult, heading up to the Hideout (21 or older) for a $30 lounger or $100 daybed is worth it."
Cdc defines close contact as being within 6 feet of someone for more than 15 minutes.Loungers and or chairs will be spaced. You need not worry about passing by someone in the pool(or we would all have it already from going to the store)https:/…public-health-recommendations.html
There is info on the GN web site about the opening of the pool on June 4th. They are only allowing hotel guests and I believe the hours are 10 AM to 6 PM. They probably will space chairs.
