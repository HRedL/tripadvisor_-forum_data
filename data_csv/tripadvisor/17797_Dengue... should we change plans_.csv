"Hi, my husband and I were thinking of going to Puerto Rico over Labor Day weekend, but I keep reading news about the Dengue epidemic and I'm wondering if we should go elsewhere (haven't bought our tickets yet!)? We would really like to spend time touring the rainforest, biobay, etc... we're not really beach people, so I'm sure mosquitos will be an issue in the type of places we like to hang out and for some reason they do seem to love my husband! He always has 10 times more bites than I do. Should we be worried? Do you think it will get worse?And if you do think we should keep our plans and still go to PR, where should we stay? I'd rather not have to worry about traffic (plan on renting a car to explore the island)..."
"I was wondering about the same thing today. We already have our tickets and the room is booked, but I'm getting a little worried. Our kids are 1 and 2 and I don't want any of us to get sick. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."
I can only say that I was just there in June and was not bitten even once. I did use the AVON non-deet bug repellent/sunscreen when on the beaches.
"Mosquitoes don't seem to like me, so I rarely use and bug spray on my body... As long as you take the precautions, like having some spray around for when you go somewhere and notice mosquitoes, you will be fine. This really isn't the kind of epidemic to cancel a trip over. Just some bug spray and you are fine."
"If you look Dengue is all over. We have cases up here in Ohio! You probably do in maryland. It's nothing new, been around for ages. It's carried by a specific type of mosquito. Those will be found in the more urban areas with standing water. You won't find them up in the rain Forest. The water flows and with natural predetors there aren't many there period. They also only breed in Fresh water. You should be just fine using common sense. Now if there are a lot of storms and standing water, of course you will see more of the critters."
"Ditto to that. Also it's true, I don't think i've ever had bug bites in the rainforest."
"You live in Maryland. You know about and live with West Nile Virus. Dengue is similar- it is a disease that is spread by an infected mosquito. Some people have mild cases and the rare person gets very sick. It is common in tropical areas, some years being worse than others.Luckily WNV hasn't been a problem for you recently. But for us, Dengue is a problem this year. We are in an epidemic, but that sounds worse than reality. Out of the roughly 4.5million people in PR, on last report about 250 people in a week reported dengue-like symptoms. As a tourist, your chances of getting it (especially the bad kind) are extremely slim. But it is best to know and take precautions. Whatever you do to avoid West Nile, do that here to avoid Dengue. You can wear bug spray with Deet when outside (especially during dawn/dusk), use AC or have screen on open windows etc. I live here, and I am not worried about it. I am aware of it, but not worried. It is more prone to be a problem in more crowded areas, and areas where lots of people live without AC or screens etc. Like a little downtown area (which is an unlikely place for a tourist to vacation !).If you don't want traffic but want to see El Yunque and a BioBay, stay at a nice place in Fajardo or in the mountains of Luquillo or Rio Grande or Ceiba. Or close to the beach."
"the front page of the leading newspaper of Puerto Rico, El Nuevo Dia, reports today that we are heading to a record breaking of dengue cases (this present gov. has broken all the records in everything...) worst that the 1998 epidemic. elnuevodia.com/sereportaquintamuertepordenguâ€¦"
