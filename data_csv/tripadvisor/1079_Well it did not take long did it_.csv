It was stupid to start up at this stage.
The crew was presumably infected by a passenger from a previous cruise. To early to start up cruising with COVID-19 still in the community.Gaja
"I have never classed Hurtigruten as a cruise line myself, though many do, as will the media. So this is another blow to the reputation of cruising, and another warning that nothing should be restarting any time soon."
"Please also note this happened in Norway, which has been very successful in controlling the coronavirus. They are months ahead of the curve in the rest of the world. That's due to a cautious public health approach, and excellent compliance by Nowegians in following rules of lockdown.The pax were Norwegian, screened before boarding. There was no one outside their travel bubble. This wasn't caused by a rogue patient with symptoms, who had to break isolation to get groceries. This was invisible, asymptomatic transmission. It was only caught through an abundance of caution, and by constantly testing and retesting EVERYONE related to the ships. There are currently only about 500 active Covid-19 cases in the whole country of 5.5 million people. Compare that to Alaska - population about 750,000, 959 new cases in the past week, per New York Times.Edited: 10:25 am, August 02, 2020 "
"Fannish, did the passenger screening include several covid testing or recent test results? I could not find any info on the web other than they were all norwegians.I read that the crew was not all Norwegian but including other nationalities. I wonder what the mix is and whether most of the + cases were from other countries..."
"Ha! Just after posting, I started reading on cruise news and I found that all 4 crew members who WERE will and tested positive were foreign nationals. I still believe that cruise lines should test their foreign crew before signing. Then quarantine 14 days in their country of origin ( while maybe training- with testing within the 14 days and frequent temperature checks) Test before leaving and straight to the airport. Test upon arrival at destination and quarantine before the ship departs. The latter may be taken as part of their ship preparation.. It would cost less in the long run this way. But again, I don't know if they are doing this already..."
"Just found more information.Apparently TUI-Mein Schiff had positive covid on their crew that sailed. No word on their passengers.https:/…That makes 3 start up line with positive AMONG their crew. Based on the news article, it was two lines (Aida and Tui) that has Covid + cases among their crew BEFORE sailing with passenges.What is not so certain, though it is reported, that Hurtigruten and TUI did not require testing or recent test results from their passengers. Which defeats the EU paper on safe cruising.Read the last paragraph just before the update sectionhttps:/…"
"Thanks, Big. The article I read only focussed on what was required of pax: that they be from the Norway travel bubble (Scandinavia, excluding Sweden).The restart was pitched as in Norwegian national interest: coastal voyages were essential to Norwegian resdients in these communities.Of course testing should start with the crew! We've heard of crew producing faked ""negative test results"", when in fact no test was performed. Did your reading indicate that Hurtigruten required foreign national employees to provide their own test results, at their own cost?If Hurtigruten didn't bear the reltively small expense of testing their employees themselves? Or only tested after hiring, and after the ships sailed? Then, those Norwegian national interests sure didn't weigh high..... and cruising got another black eye."
""" Did your reading indicate that Hurtigruten required foreign national employees to provide their own test results, at their own cost? ""I did not see that but if true, then it is a big fail. Poor people needing the jobs, especially these days, faking the test or using the cheapest test available (which happens to be inaccurate as the lab used the cheapest one). Would it not be consistent that the cruise line pay for the test to be deducted from the wage when paid (at least the initial test). If positive, cruise line shoulders the cost of the test."

"Fannish, I think they are pretty much within the ballpark. The numbers are expected to vary a bit but not wildly. And again, its also how it is written. But all of them are bad news- for cruising.Surf, agree. The cost of the test, bought in bulk, is much much less than the cost of a ship in cold or warm storage. And add it to the cost of the cruise. I do agree.Edited: 9:51 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"I am one of those people who believes we should have isolated and quarantined the high risk people and let the young and healthy spread the virus -- as we have always done over my entire lifetime. It may have been over and done by June. Wish the sports teams went to Covid Camp on a ship and quarantined for 2 weeks. We would not have to worry about the NFL season. Perhaps athletes could have volunteered to be part of the vaccine test groups. Oh well, just have to wait and Hope a vaccine comes out soon or the young people get us to herd immunity so the cruise industry can recover this winter."
MARY It is the young people under 40 now that are the spreaders of the virus They are not sure if once you have had the virus that you are immune so maybe just isolate wear a mask & stay home until the numbers drop Her in Ontario we are under 100 new cases for the past few days What about your area ???
"anyone know if the crew wore masks all the time or other type of protection?mary, i dont think letting all the young people get sick will get you to herd immunity, which is close to 80%."
"I never believed in herd immunity. This is a horrible virus by all accounts and as said, we still don't know if there is immunity for anyone who has already had it."
"#14--Who counts as high risk and how do we determine young and healthy? What about DNA? What about excessive exposure? Where do you isolate that is guaranteed safe? Sports teams are my LAST concern. Another nutty theory from a living room couch medical ""expert."" Please stay off cruise ships."
