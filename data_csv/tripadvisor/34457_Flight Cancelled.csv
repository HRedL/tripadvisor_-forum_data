I was booked June 22 on Delta to Punta Cana from the U.S. We recieved an email today saying it has been cancelled. American AIrlines still has available flights. Does anyone have any ideas why Delta cancelled but American still has flights?
Most airlines have cancelled
"It really is depending on how many people are booked on those flights I think. That said a lot of flights have been pretty empty lately and have been sure money losers for the airlines. Recently US domestic flights have been about 210K passengers flying a day down from over 2.6 million+ per day flying before the COVID 19 shutdowns.The American flights could happen if there is demand for the flights I would check seat availability on the American flight if most of the seats are still available it could cancel as well.Edited: 12:33 pm, May 13, 2020 "
More important is when will the DR allow flights back into PC.
"The airlines can have whatever schedule they want...It doesn't matter because it all depends on the Dominican govt. The govt is the one that decides when tourists can fly in, not the airlines...I know there has been no official word from the Dominican govt on when its borders will lift for tourists...So it could really just be that the American flights haven't cancelled yet..."
Also hotels don’t have opening dates starting until 1st July .
"I checked with our hotel this morning. They said they will open June 1st, but like others have said it depends on the government openning the borders."
"Same thing, DurieResort & airlines can have opening dates, flight schedules - don't mean a thing at all. Resorts/airlines don't determine when countries will open. I know people are looking for hope and promise, but people shouldn't use resort dates/airline schedules as a guide/alert. I think it just gives people false hope. Get official words from the governments and in some cases, this will take a lot of patience."
Has the DR government spoke on further lockdown ?
Another extension until June 11th is pending.
Hard Rock June 1st.
I was on phone for hour with American Airline this morning I am flying to DR July 10 they said flights will be July 1st by 10th back to normal flights to DR . Also called resort they said same July 1st opening by 10th I will be good to go if occupancy is to low they will move everyone to one other resorts.
"John T, read Cat's post # 8 ."
John T I think your dreaming. The DR is most likely going to be under state of emergency until at least June 15th. If you think resort can be restocked and up and running by July 1st. Good luck. Your not going anywhere.
Even if resorts are open and guests can get there I have a feeling a lot of guests will be upset cause the resorts will not be able to function like they did before. Can't see them having a lot of the activities and parties they did before. Dining at a resort is also going to be quite different. They may have to limit the number of guests eating at any given time.
"<< Has the DR government spoke on further lockdown ? >>Latest update. The Senate approved an extension of 25 days but an announcement will be made in the Chamber of Deputies, tomorrow at 11am DR time on exact extension.https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/polit…Angie."
The simplest answer is to just not plan anything until things have been sorted out at all levels. I can't believe anyone is planning a trip a few weeks away.Mark

There are several resorts that are planning to try and open on July 1st obviously the lockdown extension ends on June 11th so that is likely doable. He also is not looking to travel until July 10th so it is possible if flights are back running that John would be able to travel. I would certainly not expect a very full property and many resorts aren't looking at re-opening without 35-40% occupancy so its hard to say if the resort he is looking at actually opens and he likely won't know if its a go until early July and that is providing the lockdown ends on June 11th.
This is a question for US members. Currently the CDC says to quarantine for 14 days when returning from international travel. Do you see this changing any time soon? We have it is Canada also and don't see it changing any time soon. https:/…after-travel-precautions.html
This trip is just a get away hang on beach do nothing if it was a Anniversary or something along those line I would want 5 star treatment so bed Ac beach Sandwiches would be fine. I only posted because info came from a manager of airline and of resort not some blog hear say.
I would not expect a imminent change to this it is hard to say if that would even change by August at this point which is also a consideration as well.
"Deputies approve only 15 days more to the state of emergency.The resolution is known again this Friday in the Senate. PLD bloc reached an agreement with the oppositionAfter an agreement between the block of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) and opposition parties, the Chamber of Deputies approved the extension of the state of emergency for 15 days from Monday, May 18, until June 1, to continue facing the COVID-19 pandemic.The spokesman of the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM), Alfredo Pacheco, indicated that the opposition ""in a gesture of flexibility"" decided to approve 15 days, to allow space for a plan to be drawn up and for the political and social forces to be called to discuss the return to a new normality within COVID-19.Pacheco warned that the opposition will not approve a more state of emergency, because PLD candidates are taking advantage of the pandemic to campaign politically and use state resources to seek position.""Don't bring us any more extensions because we don't approve more extensions,"" he said.Prior to the session, the opposition blocks proposed that they be approved only 10 more days of the state of emergency, alleging that the Government is campaigning on the issue of the pandemic.The session, scheduled for 11:00 in the morning, began at 3:00 in the afternoon after the spokespersons of the blocs met with the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Radhamés Camacho.The resolution will be known again this Friday at 11:00 am in the Senate, which had approved the 25 days requested by President Danilo Medina on Monday, May 12.The spokesman for the deputies of the People's Force, Henry Merán, warned that if an agreement to reactivate the economy is not applied and ""we will not fall into the vicious circle of the government being deficient and us approving a state of emergency.""The deputy Pedro Botello requested that the committees to which the resolution was delivered be disempowered so that employees can access 30% of the pension funds so that they would be known in the session, since those committees could not meet.But the president of the Chamber of Deputies explained that these commissions have not ceased in their exercise of functions within the state of emergency.The Liberal Reformist Party (PLR) sent a short list to fill the vacancy of the deceased deputy Hector Peguero, made up of Saulo Sierra, Fernando Valdéz, Tanya Carolina Rivera, but it was left on the table.A minute of silence was paid for the death of the mother of the deputy Nancy Santos.https:/…Angie."
My question.. not to be harsh but did you really think you would be going June 22.. smart play would be wait til Sept minimum...
"We booked this trip 8 + months ago and have been holding out hope we could go. I have been lucky that I still have a job. Not only that, we have had to work 70-80 hours a week since this started. I am burnt out and need a vacation. I am going to do everything I can to go as long as its permitted. If the borders are open, the resort is open and flights are allowed to go, we will be going. If we do go, we intend to take every precaution. My Mother in-law is a nurse and will also be going. I relaize she cant stop the virus, but she can help us to keep as safe as possible. If things are open, someone has to be the 1st people to go."
I am in same boat booked in December 2019 for July 10th been working overtime keeping data center up for 5000 people in are company working from home. We wear mask and gloves daily all the time I will go if it’s open in July.
"I’m working as well.. we had to cancel our April trip and have the luxury to book any time they reopen. That being said, no way in hell will we be the first group or even the first month or 2 after reopening... I’ll wait.. much more involved than sitting on a beach. They will absolutely not be ready.. hopefully going over New Years"
We had a trip for June the 10th to Punta Cana that was cancelled which is not a surprise for me .As for going back i sure will not be one of the first in line to go to another country  What will insurance companies do when we travel will they cover people if they get the Virus on vacation i would not bet on it .
Cdn insurance companies are not covering trips that were booked and cancelled due to covid so not sure what insurance companies here will do in the future regarding covid. Most insurance companies here have wiggled their way out of paying/refunding trips booked and cancelled due to covid. Will be interesting to see what new insurance policies will cover or not cover in the future.
Hey Deb. Long time no speak. Saw something on the news yesterday about forcing tour operators to reimburse folks for trips instead of vouchers. Not sure how much traction it will get (ongoing petition with thousands signed alfeady).
"Hey Sly... been trying to staff off of TA as you know things are changing daily ;-)Yes, thousands of people signing petitions and trying to force useless Trudope into NOT giving bailouts until people receive refunds, some people are out $50K as they booked weddings etc. a once in a lifetime event and no plans to ever return so they want their money back, lots of other reasons as well. The vouchers are useless as you can only apply them after you've booked/travelled AND the price as in my case has doubled. In some cases the resorts won't be open by the expiry date AND/OR you have to pay the difference in cost, sometimes amounting to quite a few hundred dollars per person, but, if the price is lower you don't get the difference back. All the airlines that did offer refunds have all reneged on the deal citing all kinds of reasons and changed their contracts after the fact (illegal) and JT won't take a stand. They have customers money that wasn't applied to their trips so that money should be available, but they claim they are broke and expect the consumers money to keep them afloat. That's not legal, Meanwhile AC for example is sitting on billions in profits but are asking JT to bail them out... and of course that's OUR money, not JT's. Did you see the airline dude saying he is on his knees begging for customers not to ask for refunds as they will go broke? But yet the same people they have stolen money from have gone broke and just want to put food on their tables while the fatcat CEOs haven't taken a hit... I could go on and on and until the Cdn market is resolved a lot of Cdns will not travel as insurance isn't even covering their refunds and have now put clauses in for future travel... so if airlines and insurance companies aren't protecting the consumers and are now leary of travelling.... Our gov't and airlines need to step up to reinstate some assurance and confidence that they ""have our back""."
"I'm with you. No pity for airlines really and the more they piss off customers, less money and travellers they will get once travel resumes."
"Exactly.. they are shooting themselves in the foot. Travellers want to feel confident when booking in the future. I have a few thousand tied up in this mess. Also, I just rechecked, minutes ago... for the one trip I booked for $1140 per person WITH upgrades is right now, as of this very minute, is now $2235 PER PERSON and that's with no upgrades.Fat lot of good a voucher is right now."
"Yes, interesting to see prices are jacked up starting February 2021 compared to this year... coincidence? Everyone 's voucher won't cover if they travel February-May compared to prices this year."
"mine wont' even cover half if I travel in November let alone peak season :-(Edited: 3:56 pm, May 24, 2020 "
