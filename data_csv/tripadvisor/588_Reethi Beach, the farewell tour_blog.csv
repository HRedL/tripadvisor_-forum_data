Looking forward to your updates ppply. We have 5 more sleeps then we are off....BA to Doha then Qatar to Male so not so great for a long sleep and then a domestic flight and a boat before we reach Raffles! But the journey is always worth it!
"Yaaay, another blog!I too have fond memories from RB, it is a beautiful island. It is sad that they are soon closing the doors. I hope most of the staff are still there and have not left to other resorts.You are off 3 days before me. It is really getting close now!WIll follow this blog for sure ;-)"
"I hope you have a similar experience with the Air France transit as we did this time, ppply. I don’t know who conveys you to Paris from U.K. but for us it is Hop! which entailed a lengthy bus ride from aircraft to terminal then the train shuttle to the gate. The new shops and cafes were all up and running instead of the boards hiding construction work as was the situation last year. Fortunately we had plenty of time to kill so no worries there. Homeward bound we were 40 minutes late taking off on our return journey and did not make up any time due to strong headwinds. By the time we landed our 1h 35minutes transit time had narrowed and we only had 35 minutes before our gate closed which previously would have been very tight and we were sure we would not make it in time. However we disembarked at the same terminal as our onward flight and since last year they have opened a bank of new security gates where you scan your boarding card then put hand baggage through the scanners. It was much quicker and efficient and we made it to the gate 15 minutes after landing and before it had even opened. Of course it wasn’t perfect as our luggage didn’t make it!"
Lucky you! Have a wonderful time :)
"Bon voyage,ppply. I would be interested in where Babatosh from Moodhu is going or has gone, also Aminal and Islam."
On your way!
"Dianna.....Babatosh is at Cheval Blanc Randheli, Islam is back in Bangladesh working on the family prawn farm.Not sure about Aminal.John"
"Safe and happy travels apply. As you know we visited RB three times; it was our first experience of The Maldives and a place where we made memories we'll treasure forever. The closure of this resort will be a big loss to the market in my opinion; probably to be replaced with a swanky, overbuilt replacement in due course. Am sure you'll have an amazing time; please remember Rob and I to Peter and the whole team and bid RB a fond farewell from us."
"@suffolk-John, thanks for the info."
I've told him that we'll go and see him if he pays!!!!John
"Looking forward to your views, 22 days to go for us."
"Hi Martine, Just wanted to point out that this forum is for travellers and you're not making contact with the resort here. The resort doesn't close until the end of April so I can't imagine there'll be any impact on your holiday at all or any reason why the resort should have informed you of this. The Manager and team at Reethi Beach have always been focused on making your holiday there wonderful and I'm sure that won't change in any way in the lead up to the closure. The island is still being maintained and run as it always has been so there should be no concerns on that front either. As you've seen ppply who's one of our Destination Experts has just arrived at RB and I'm sure will continue her blog from her final visit which should put your. mind at rest. You've chosen a wonderful resort (we've visited 3 times) and I'm sure you'll have a wonderful holiday. You're fortunate to be visiting before the end of an era. If you have any specific concerns or questions I'd recommend emailing guest relations at the resort who are very responsive, or making contact via your travel agent/tour operator if you're using one. I hope that's a help."
"Thankyou very much for your reply, I am looking forward to going so much . Thanks again.martinex"
"So what is happening when they close down, is it in the plan to be reopened as a new island? ppply maybe u can find out please ? The only concern I can say is towards the last few weeks, I would think is pretty certain that they will be out of stock of certain things as they will not re order. We had that on our second trip, second week with a couple of our favourite wines."
Hooray glad you are safely there. Looking forward to this blog so much.
Maniyafushi.Scheduled to be open Oct/Nov last I heard.Probably April/May I guess.John
"Glad to hear that you have a lovely time, and that fishlife is still good! There are lots of resorts with erosion at the moment.Well, I better remember to adjust the mobile to island time when I arrive on monday. Sorry, but I had a laugh ;-)"
Sounds blissful. The new island sounds interesting too. Loving your blog pply. Thank you
I'm enjoying the blog Ppply.
"Love your blog (just caught up with it).I am so glad to read that you are still having a wonderful time at RB!!And no, 3km is not a shame when on holiday! Rather do an extra snorkel and swim against the current haha. Looking forward to updates ;-)))"
"All sounding fab, ppply.What meal plan are you on? I haven’t heard you mention the Grill. What about Saima Garden, do you still get a repeaters' dinner there?I always love a turtle ( who doesn’t?) but I think that I love seeing an octopus even more. How lucky to see two interacting either romantically or otherwise."
You mentioned the Full Moon. When we were at A.Havodda at Full Moon time the sea definitely became more choppy afterwards for a while.
I would have been so excited about the 'cuddling' octopuses!!
"The Moon made an appearance during our second week at Amari as well and completely changed the lagoon/sea.The SR side became rougher, in fact the arrival jetty was damaged and out of commission for the rest of our stay.The SS side became millpond still. But the tide was pulled so far out, you could walk all the way to the reef and only get wet upto your waist. Was a bit surreal."
"Re repeaters dinner, ppply, I am sure you have heard our Northern phrase “ shy bairn’s get nowt.” If you are interested in having it, I would be asking do they still do it. I seem to recall we were given invitations in the past but I can’t recall at what point in the trip. It would be a shame to miss out. It was one of the highlights of our last trip."
"Continues to sound blissful there ppply. I've seen two octopi having a territorial battle at Reethi but never mating - lucky you. How are the gardens looking? I love wandering round them and over the years its been a pleasure to see them mature. I think leaving them will be a real wrench for the gardening team, such a shame, although I think some of the team have moved to Faru now. I am with Dianna "" don't be shy in coming forward"" - go ask. I have even been extra cheeky and asked to swap my dinner for wine/ money off at the grill. Thank you for all your up dates really enjoying them although I'm still gutted that I wont be back before it closes."
"ppply, possibly the GM was busy getting someone to organise your repeaters' dinner..."
"Nah, I reckon Peter was off stockpiling loo rolls!"
"ppply, have you looked for bio luminescent plankton?We were there this time 3 years ago and always walked back to our villa along the water’s edge at the end of the night.Head towards the water villas from your room and most nights we saw some, only little bits - not the full monty - mainly around villas 129/130. I know it doesn’t necessarily fall in the same place but got to be worth a look if you’ve never seen any."
"No turtles here so far.. I hope to see one before I leave, I just love them. Continue to have a FAB holiday!"
I hope this is not you: https:/…
"pply, loving reading your blog. I feel very lucky to be in the Maldives right now with all that is going on back home and the worry for folk waiting for their departure dates."
Testing on a guest at Reethi Beach Resort has returned a negative result for COVID-19 according to the resort.
"Such good news for all re the testing. It must be very tough for those staff that still don't know what the future holds for them too.But ..... apart from feeling your irritation at that awful watersport thing really enjoying your reports., Hope it does not make another apearance"
"Good news about your repeaters' dinner, ppply. I don’t know if you have had one before but when we did it was fabulous.I recommend you just stay there. It’s all doom and gloom here."
So glad you got two treats - one the repeaters dinner and two no more noisy water sports. Well a third as well.... surely RBR just has the most amazing fish soup/ quantities. Echo Dianne - just stay there... its crap here and getting crappier by the day .
"Oh dear ppply, that is not going to be the best end to your trip. I have always found Air France to be very responsive on Messenger but these are strange time. With that wait you would ordinarily be entitled to a hotel stay and compensation but I don’t know if that is applicable in this situation. Maybe they would grant you entry into one of the lounges. Anyway putting that to one side it seems that Reethi Beach hasn’t let you down, water jetters and room boy not withstanding. Enjoy your last few days."
"Thanks @D53!Actually we’re using messenger to chat with them. They’ve been pretty good tbh, given the current chaos.Of course we asked for a quicker connection which isn’t possible but they will provide food and a hotel room for us, so all in all not that bad.We’ve had a lovely afternoon lounging around, it’s been quite breezy and the sea has some white tips to the waves. Just having a glass of rose and some nibbles before dinner.RBR certainly has lived up well to our expectations and it’s reputation, I will be doubly sad to leave when the time comes..."
"Best of luck getting home.Ironically not only is this a farewell to RB, but a farewell to Maldives for the foreseeable :("
Looks like my first trip to Reethi is off with the borders closing to UK nationals. Was due to go on the 25/3Good luck to all the staff.
"Dear all at Reethi Beach, we were due to stay with you next week and very excited to meeting you all on your beautiful island, however it is not meant to be, I wish you all the very best for the future and hope one day I’ll be able experience the lovely staff and hotel and of course the beach! Good luck to you all, best wishes, Martine Xxx"
Glad all is going well. Another day in paradise not too much of a pain (except for the cat) and you should get the additional expense back via insurance. Like you we are fast becoming some of the last guests here too....
"I hope Saima was as good as it used to be! Oh dear, 12 hours at CDG is painful, but at least you can relax and have a nap in the hotel AAAND one more day in paradise ;-)"
"Sooo jealous. Love Reethi Beach and wish it wouldn't be changing. Never mind about the transfer home, that's not worth thinking about when you're in paradise. Enjoy the rest, and thanks for sharing your diary."
Thanks for the post and you’ll count yourself lucky having had that holiday at this time! Safe travels home
"Day 14 (the unplanned day)We should have been on the seaplane now heading back to Male for a late morning flight to Paris...Breakfast was very surreal - barely 10 tables occupied, and a pretty subdued feel.The staff tell us that the resort is now closing earlier than anticipated in around 10 days time. Some have been offered places at Reeth Faru and others are still unaware of where they’ll be - or at least they’re not sharing with us...The other day we joked that we may be the last people in room 108, well now it looks like we almost certainly will be!Guests numbers are falling dramatically now, some have reached the end of their stay like us, others have brought forward their return date as they’re anxious about being stuck here. It all has a bit of a sad feel I’m afraid.Well, we’re off the do some packing, then the rest of the day will be filled with sitting, reading and at least one more search for the turtle and nurse shark, both of whom have eluded us for the last few days..."
"Thanks for the blog, ppply.I have been reading it from afar (Caribbean) and enjoying your day by day account.It’s very surreal here too. Our hotel is closing tomorrow and we will be spending our last four nights in a different hotel, all unplanned. Really weird atmosphere tonight, hardly anyone around. Just hoping we can get back ok next Tuesday.Wishing everyone in the Maldives and elsewhere a safe trip home."
"Oh ppply, it’s all very bittersweet now, isn’t it. I have imagined I was at RB, too, via your blog and it is very sad that it has to close even earlier in these awful circumstances.It is evident that you have had a great time up to now and I hope Air France doesn’t let you down and your homeward journey goes smoothly. Enjoy your last few hours in one of our favourite resorts and wish it and its staff a fond farewell from us.Edited: 5:47 am, March 20, 2020 "
Thank you for sharing your holiday with us ppply! I wish you a safe journey back home xxx
"Lovely blog ppply, and wishing you a safe trip home."
Safe journey and thanks for the blog
"Hi my better half was also chased by Trevor (or another trigger fish!) this afternoon for the first time, he found it very scary and exhausting, hope you arrive home safelyx"
"Well, the last (maybe) blog entry from me...Departure from RBR was doubly sad, guests were leaving in fairly big numbers and the staff were huddled in groups waiting to see if anyone needed a plate clearing or a glass filling. Of course, they were on it as soon as it did!We had a short medical form to complete with the island doctor and needed our temperature taking then off, form in hand, to the seaplane.The guest relations lady who saw us off confirmed that the rumour from the new management is to re-open the resort pretty much as is. She said she thought the original plan was for just a few weeks shut down, but now that COVID-19 is with us world wide that will likely be much longer and nobody can guess at this stage.Male airport felt fairly normal, albeit a bit quieter than usual. We had a small delay leaving, not entirely sure why... the Air France crew were super and went above and beyond looking after people. The captain announced shortly before take off that every staff member on board had volunteered to do the run to Male and back. Food service was a little limited, but tasty.On arrival at CDG we were expecting to be provided with an overnight stay somewhere by Air France; they had told us they would. However the guys at the transfer desk were clearly quite stressed with many disruptions to handle. They apologised and told us that for about a week now, they had been instructed not to provide accommodation or meals to anyone. The instructions were to sort yourself as best you can and then claim it back from AF.Fortunately Mr Ppply had already done his research in case of this outcome and immediately got online to book us into the Yotel, the transfer hotel in the terminal, and off we trotted bleary eyed to find it. At this point we’d been awake for almost 20 hours...As you might imagine there was a queue when we got there. It was hardly moving and everyone was tired and stressed. The poor chap booking people in!Anyway after a wait of about 20-30 mins, which felt more like an hour, he called for anyone who already had a reservation. Well that was us and another small group in the queue and those were the last two rooms available! We were actually pretty impressed with the room. Very compact, a little noisy but all in all for an emergency sleep it was very comfortable.Everything is shut at CDG, shops food vendors, everything. It’s really like a ghost town. There are a few vending machines dotted around but mostly they only have the odd bottle of water and sugary sweets left. This morning we managed to find one vendor selling coffee - bliss!We’re now sitting on our final plane ready to depart to London, then it’s a short taxi home, collect the cat, see what the shops have left and batten down the hatches!We feel so lucky to have managed to get our holiday, literally by the skin of our teeth I think.Good luck to everyone still travelling, or going through the cancellation/insurance claim process. I hope it all goes smoothly for you.Stay safe folks, hopefully in a few weeks things will begin to return to normal and the fall out won’t have cost us, our valued travel agents or our beloved Maldives too greatly x"
"Great blog Ppply thanks for posting and safe journey home, hope your kitties are pleased to see you, ours are always in the huff with us after pick up until it's feeding time then they cave!"
"Not quite as smooth a return as anticipated, ppply, but I suppose things could have been worse. At the end of the day once your holiday is over you just want to be home without the bother.Great blog by the way. Let’s hope RBR does reopen as its own true self and that we are all in a position to revisit in the not too far distant future.Welcome back to Blighty and may your loo rolls be many!"
Thanks for posting the photos. I so loved this place.
Thanks for the blog and I enjoyed seeing your photos.We went to the buffet on St Patrick’s day 3 years ago. There was a lot of green in evidence!
"Paula at Magic of Maldives just posted on their FB page that Reethi Brach will reopen, with many familiar faces, on October 1st (presumably current circumstances permitting)!! Let the good times roll..."
"Ah beaten to it.I must try to get to Reethi - current crazy times permitting.... Had life gone as little old me had planned I'd currently be flying... I now find myself in the (unknown to me) situation of having lots of annual leave and money in the holiday account, alas no way to use it!"
"Pug Hugger,So sorry to read how things haven't panned out for you. We are in the same boat in many ways. Here in WA the situation has vastly improved. I'm just not that happy that things are going slowly in getting things going again. We have bookings for October, and it's very hard to see how things are going to pan out for us Aussies. I have no fear at all at the moment that this virus is going to keep us isolated here in aussie land, but it looks like international travel is going to be the biggest hurdle for us to be able to travel overseas again. Alan"
"Pughugger, our holiday to the Seychelles is not happening next month either.. At least there will be a bigger budget next year.I am glad to hear that Reethi is scheduled to reopen this autumn. Wonder if they will refurbish the rooms and if the planned increase of water villas will happen."
