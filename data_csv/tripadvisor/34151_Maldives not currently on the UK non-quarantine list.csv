"According to https:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors The Maldives has missed out on the first set of 'Air Bridges"" to the UK so returning travellers will be required to quarantine"
"Its more they have not been removed from the ""all but essential"" travel list. I will put up with the quarantine on return - lucky I know that I can - but without the removal of all but essential travel there will be no insurance cover."
Albion - you are quite correct. That non-essential list hadn't been updated when I posted originally The full list is at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…Maldives isn't on the list as exempt.
Hopefully the list is under constant review. Although I hope the UK keeps our numbers down & we don't get put back on the maldives you aren't welcome list
Looking at it logically (and hopefully) I don't think the UK will do anything until the Maldives update their entry requirements which look to change on 15th July.
Good point!
Honestly I would be happy to self isolate at home but not quarantine in a city hotel
"As Albion says, insurance is the issue. Otherwise, for those of us that can quarantine on return, we'd likely get better deals and quieter islands.Edited: 7:20 am, July 04, 2020 "
"The following is copied from the U.K. Government advice on travel corridors:“If you have been to or stopped in a country that’s not on the travel corridor list you will have to self-isolate until 14 days have passed since you left that country“To me this reads that if you transit through a country which is not on the list you will have to self isolate on returning home which will involve a lot of indirect flights e.g. going via Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi,Colombo....etc."
Quarantine at home no problem for me - about time the kids helped me out. Think they would enjoy shopping for me although I am sure I would be told to do a delivery shop!!. I would just like to get something booked but am reluctant until the government give the go ahead. As I have said to my travel agent ready steady......... but no go at the moment.
@dianna that is quite a cryptic message... i would hope that “stopped” meant exited the airside terminal of whichever country you have your layover in but you may as well be correct. if it’s purely where you’ve had your layover then this means that brits are essentially banned from flying with many many carriers!
"As the message says ""if you been to OR stopped in"" I read that as meaning including a stopover or layover en route to/from The Maldives. This wouldn't mean that travellers from the UK were ""essentially banned"" though, it would mean that they would need to factor in the requirement to self isolate for 14 days on return to the UK and make an informed decisions to whether to travel or not. For some travellers this might be deal breaker but for others it wouldn't. I do however think that it's vital that these messages are relayed in clear and unambiguous language so that they are explicit. At the moment many messages (and not just around ""air bridges/travel) are so unclear or confusing you have to ask yourself if the people who wrote them even understood what they said!"
"The reason I suspected it may be the case is because, even if you remain airside you are still potentially mixing with many people from other countries which may not be on the list of travel corridors. There again this will happen at your holiday destination, too, no matter where you go.Personally I keep changing my mind about what is really meant.Typical ambiguity from U.K. Government. The author knows what they mean but the traveller can’t be sure."
I have just been looking at the U.K. FCO travel advice Facebook page and yesterday someone asked the very question I am puzzled about see posts 8 and 12. The answer was to simply give a link link the exact same page from the U.K. Government travel corridor list which is causing the ambiguity. So no further forward or don’t they know the answer either?!
"Response from U.K. FCO travel to my query is that to stop in a country includes in transit airside.Edited: 12:23 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"Thank you for clarifying Dianna53, I'm sure that will impact the travel plans of many from the UK whilst the requirement to self isolate is in place. Another reason to hope that year round direct flights from BA or another operator might happen sometime."
Lufthansa has some great fares (under £500) via Frankfurt...
"I know its difficult, but I wish they'd pull their finger out.My wifes work isn't too busy right now, so decent chance of her getting leave. If there's another outbreak that will change (particularly if it coincides with Flu season). Plus her Ig test came back positive, we were never overly worried, but it just gives further comfort.So a holiday is higher up the agenda now if a good deal turns up."
"Antibodies mean absolutely nothing from what we know so far -what titre is enough to gave protection, if you have some sort of immunity then how long does it last? So don’t make anything out of that test. After working in healthcare through all these months and having 3 holidays cancelled I am absolutely desperate for a holiday. We have Maldives booked for December 2020 and April 2021 and all this lack of clarity drives me mad."
"Radu A, I wasn't implying it conferred immunity. They are given a disclaimer to sign, confirming they understand the test does not mean they have immunity or that they can't be a vector. And of course being frontline in a major hospital they have been discussing this in any case.It affords comfort in that it provides affirmation of the risk factors in our demographic. We have discussed risk factors (my area of expertise) when she decided she would work through this and concluded we were at relatively low risk. The fact she's contracted SARS-COV-2, suffered minimal symptoms (she doesn't know for sure when she had it, other then a few days with loss of taste/smell), gives some comfort she is unlikely to be one of the exceptions in our demographic. Of course there are no guarantees, but it is a reasonable assumption in the absence of conclusive studies.Edited: 8:00 am, July 07, 2020 "
"ar_perth,LOL, rub it in why dont you :D"
This is absolutely ridiculous as Maldives is the safest place to go. Why the government allow people to fly without quarantine on return to UK to countries who COVID is worst than in Maldives??
Personally I’ll happily quarantine for 14 days on return to keep everyone safe. I too have worked all the way through the lock down period and beyond - have had 3 holidays canceled and am now ready for a much needed rest and holiday. I understand that this is an issue for some people but so many people have been furloughed or have worked from home for a long period surely a 14 quartile period is a small price to pay to keep the UK out of further lock downs. If government states for safety and piece of mind sto stop further spread and protect the NHS I’ll happily self quarantine in return.
"My own personal thoughts are that as The Maldives still has a State of Emergency for Health and also because their medical facilities are very limited, they don’t currently meet the criteria for being included on the exemption list.I understand that it is possible to secure insurance to travel there despite the FCO advice but I don’t know which companies will cover you or at what cost."
"HiYes - omission of Maldives from the exemption list is indeed confusing. Baa Atoll would be my destination of choice if I could get there - there is a 20 bed IC unit ready to go which has never been used. Richard from PurelyMaldivesEdited: 1:19 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"I see Sri Lanka is now on the ""Countries and territories exempt from advice against ‘all but essential’ "" list. Maldives next - fingers crossed. Think I would feel safer on a maldives island than in Sri Lanka!!"
A change from 'essential travel only' advice would be a step in the right direction but it wouldn't automatically follow that no quarantine would be necessary. The Spanish islands are in this exact predicament at present although they are trying to resolve it with the UK government.
I agree Wid but some of us are quite happy to quarantine and luckily are in a position whereby this is possible. We would have to quarantine anyway if travelling via dubai etc.
"Yes, we are both retired so self isolating wouldn't be an issue for us either but it was worth pointing out to avoid any misunderstandings. Can't help wondering if the direct Heathrow/Male BA route is about to experience a surge in popularity if the advice does indeed change."
"Hi Richard, by any chance do you have travel insurance that would cover you should the worst happen and you contracted COVID? If you don’t I hope you have seriously deep pockets!...and as far as ICU in the Maldives is concerned yes they might have limited available beds at the moment but that could change anytime...I have posted before about the alternatives of ending up on a quarantine island, not for me"
Hello ARYes we have COVID medical insurance. RegardsRichard at PurelyMaldives
"Hi AR - I think we are at cross purposes here and the posts refer to the UK situation. With the Foreign Office not removing the ""only essential travel"" we cannot travel with normal travel insurance. If the UK government add us to the ""exemption list"" we can travel but at the moment we will have to quarantine on our RETURN to the UK. I have found lots of insurance companies that will cover for Covid as long as the foreign office are saying you can travel."
"Hi, we booked our trip to the Maldives for April but waiting on the FCO to update the travel advice so we can buy insurance, can you advise which insurance company you are with that covers covid ? Thank you"
"Staysure are selling policies that cover Covid, I don't know the exact details though."
"This is a latest list from Which news. This is subject to change of course & applies to UK providers. This relates to 5 potential scenarios COVER:1. If your destination restricts its boarders before you travel for reasons relating to the pandemic.2. If the FCO changes its advice before you travel.3. If your hotel closes while you are there.4. If you have been told to self isolate by NHS, but haven’t been tested.5. If a family / household member is diagnosed with COVID-19 meaning you have to self isolate.6.If you are diagnosed with COVID-19.INSURERS:Nationwide...covers 1,2,3,4,5,6 aboveAllClear... covers 2,4,5,6 aboveInsurefore...covers 3,6 aboveJet2...covers 3,6 aboveAllianz Assistance...covers 4,5,6 aboveTrailfinders...covers 4,5,6 aboveAbta...covers 5,6 aboveAxa...covers 5,6 aboveStaysure...covers 5,6 aboveNOTE: Nationwide has the widest coronovirus cover. The downside is it won’t work for a single trip policy; you can only get Nationwide travel insurance if you open a bank account with the building society.Medical expenses would vary between insurers but in general would cover cost whilst away along with repatriation and any extension of stay would be detailed in the providers individual cover."
"Hi thanks for the info, we do have nationwide travel insurance but their website says they won't cover covid if you've booked the holiday with the FCO advice saying only essential travel. As we booked our holiday last week I don't think were covered?"
"Hi, if you have booked a package holiday then if the FCO advice is still in place near departure, then your travel operator / agent will be responsible in dealing with your refund.Edited: 4:37 am, July 28, 2020 "
"Just be aware that there are 2 strands to this and hopefully the Governments reaction to the way they handled the Balearics and Canaries now sets a future precedent.The two strands are FCO Advice (all but essential Travel) and Travel Corridors (14 day Self Isolation on return) Insurers and Package Tour Ops only take notice of FCO Advice, hence why there was outcry when the Balearics and Canaries were exempt from FCO Advice but the Travel Corridor was introduced - Package Tour Ops were not interested in refunding nor Insurers providing cover.The best advice I can give is book anything as a Package through an Agent/Tour Op (Insurers will pass you to the Tour Op if a Package and FCO Advice means you can't go!) and get as comprehensive Insurance cover as you can to cover both pre travel Covid complications in respect of cancellation, decent medical cover and also cover if you are required to quarantine on arrival. However some Tour Ops are trying to bypass the regulations and trying to get Consumers to waive their package rights if a holiday is booked when Countries are exempt from FCO Advice and that subsequently changes, as are some Insurers with their policy cover.The whole situation is a mess!Edited: 10:00 am, July 31, 2020 "
"Hi We are due to go to Maldives on 8/11/20( postponed from 22/6/20). U.K. insurance can be obtained to cover COVID-19 issues by a company called Battleface. However only upto age 59, which counts me out but not my wife!. They will still insure for everything else though and price for a one off trip wasn’t exorbitant. We still haven’t decided what to do yet though."
Hi just read your post re medical insurance fir the Maldives fir Covid-19 are you able to give me any details please? I’m struggling to get anyThanks Jeff
