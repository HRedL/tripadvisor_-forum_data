"Hi. I know this is a popular topic now but still. I'm planing to go to Bali on 15.2. for 2 weeks. I have read the whole internet and I saw that there aren't any confirmed cases of coronavirus in Indonesia but still... I'm wondering if it is worth the risk, since we can not know what the situation in 3 weeks is going to be like, + i'm questioning the reliability of local authoritiesOn the other side, I really want to go, was looking forward to this trip for months now... If anyone has any recomendations, experiences or anything, please let me know.Thanks!"
"I dunno, I haven't read the whole internet."
Which airline and route are you flying? With no reports of cases in all of Indonesia I would not yet (personally) be worried about time in Bali.
"Hi Jan,only you can assess the risk.Don’t know where you are from or what you do or where you have been in the last 2 weeks but you may have already met someone who was somewhere where somebody else who had been on a bus with somebody who was in a meeting with somebody who went in a taxi with a driver who’d been to the airport and picked up somebody who’d been on a flight where somebody behind them sneezed.Doesn’t necessarily have to be Chinese (although maybe higher risk) but it is the contact risk.Who knows. My son’s girlfriend works for Lufthansa. Cabin crew longhaul. Hasn’t done Beijing lately but plenty of other longhaul flights. Many east. Who knows who was on board and from where.Munich is very popular for tourist visits and I have seen large chinese tourist groups.Very close to me is a military university. They have Chinese Military students. My wife has been on courses with some of them in the past.Should I be more worried about the University than my Bali trip in May.I am not worried about my trip in May."
A quick look at jans profile shows that she is flying from Vienna to Bali on China Southern Airlines with obviously a stop in China. I have nothing more to say as my maths would prevent me boarding in Vienna.
Thats an old version. That flight was canceled. Now i was considering flying from Zagreb through Doha to Bali with Qatar Airlines
Zagreb - Doha - Bali
"You may read it:14. Re: Health screenings in BaliFeb 2, 2020, 1:40 AMUntil nowadays Indonesia has no corona virus victim. Indonesia has many experiences before with bird flu virus, so Indonesia know well about viruses.The great possibility of corona virus spread is through droplets. But a taxi driver in Thailand get corona virus without visit China, but drive healthy China tourists. So, it means healthy people have been infected by virus and have no symptoms can spread the virus through the air/breath.Corona virus is self limited life virus as dengue fever virus. Until nowadays all death victim are old persons and have other diseases (complication). The percentage of death is 3 to 4 percent, small compare to SARS in 2002.The best way against viruses is healthiness. Use hand sanitizer is wise action.Additional: All big countries in Southeast Asia have corona virus positive patients and in the Philippines one victim dead. Indonesia use WHO protocol: 241 Indonesian have been transferred from Wuhan after screening in China for corona virus, 3 of them must be observe in China to detect have corona virus or not. So, 238 Indonesian healthy persons evacuate directly to Indonesia for 14 days observation in a quarantine. It is WHO protocol, whereas USA use only 3 days observation only, but there are several patients with positive corona virus in USA.Bird flu virus is more lethal than corona virus, because bird flu patient without any other diseases (complication) can dead."
"Hello Jan, Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi said in a press conference yesterday. The Indonesian government will ban all direct flights from the mainland China from landing on Indonesian territories starting at 00:00 a.m. on Wednesday, 5th February. No timeframe given to resume flights so that should lower the risk of coming into contact with potential carriers."
The first Asia country ban it is Singapore since several days ago. There are several corona virus positive patients in Singapore. Some airlines have discontinued fly to China and make many China tourists stranded at foreign countries. Lion Air fly to Wuhan to deliver China tourists in Indonesia and fly back to Indonesia empty and directly disinfected when arrive in Indonesia and then stop flying to Wuhan.
Is this true that flights from Wuhan China are coming to bali
"Flights from Wuhan were going direct to Bali till the Chinese government stopped them.I'm glad to hear that Indonesia has put a ban on flights from China. Not that that is the panacea, as Piggy points out it can potentially come from anywhere but as the point of origin, it does cut down on the chances. I do feel for the Balinese, though who are making their living from Chinese tourists. Hopefully this won't last for too long.FWIW I'm going in a month and am still going.Edited: 6:28 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"I flying from Brisbane to Bali on 5 March with Malindo Air. I'm not concerned, but I will possibly take antiseptic wipes to wipe down the tray table and armrest. I don't normally do that kind of thing. I do use hand sanitiser though, both when travelling, or during flu season in Australia. Having said that, I have no idea how Corona Virus is transmitted so it may be totally unnecessary.The BNE-DPS flight continues on to KL. Malindo have flights form Guangzhou and Hong Kong to KL, so I assume there are people in China that will fly to KL, then KL to DPS on the same plane that continues on to Brisbane."
"With as many Chinese tourist that fly and holiday into Indonesia, I don't believe for one second that there aren't any cases of Coronavirus in Indonesia.I'm not saying that there is blatant coverup - I have read that Indonesia doesn't have the tech to do testing that gives the fastest results. However, let's not kid ourselves into believe that somehow the coronavirus skipped over Indonesia. If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn lol. Isn't that the second highest country of Chinese tourism behind Malaysia?Here is a real time global map of confirmed cases around the world. Malaysia has 8 so farhttps:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/…My friend is currently working in Bali. Business as usual although the tourism industry is taking a hit. The Chinese dollar is real. Lack of it may cause businesses to suffer. So be kind and spend extra on the island.Edited: 7:02 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"StewpyeLet me tell you that I have been sanitizing the seats/armrest/tray tables on planes for the past 4 years now. It doesn't matter if I'm sitting in coach, business, or first class. Other passengers would look at me like I'm crazy or paranoid, but I don't care. It is just a great practice to do no matter what because the planes don't get cleaned properly. If you were to take a UV light to these areas, you would be seriously grossed out."
"Hopefully this is a wake up call to the Chinese who eats anything that moves and slaughters endangered animals for some of their ridiculous beliefs. An article l read suggests this virus has a link to what they eat.Cat.... will definitely be wiping down my area around my seat on my next flight, thanks for the tip."
"According to The Telegraph, the top destinations of Chinese are Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea and Singapore. And other than Asia, the U.S. and Italy get the most Chinese. One sad effect I see on these forums and in real life (not just Indonesia) is people villifying Chinese, even those who have never been to China. I just hope it doesn't devolve into more open prejudice as Indonesian experienced a few years ago during the end of the Suharto era when Chinese were used as scapegoats."
"From January to October 2018, China was the biggest outbound country for foreign tourist arrivals to Bali, with more than 1.2 million direct foreign tourist arrivals. Early 2019 showed a similar trend although do i believe Aussie have moved back to the number 1 position. The lack of Chinese visitors will defiantly effect Bali’s economy. I don’t know about food choices but I understand the virus outbreak has been tracked to the live food market in Wuhan. I hope the habit of spitting out chewing tobacco and coughing up phlegm in the open has stopped.Edited: 11:48 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"Until nowadays there are SARS, MERS and Novel Corona Virus SARS, MERS and nCOV2019 are Corona Virus with different strain.Fatality to death of the patients with the Corona Virus are:SARS: about 10 percentMERS: about 35 percentnCov2019: up to 4 percentBut the nCov2019 virus is spreading swiftly.SARS is caused by bat, but without eat the bat, you can get the infection, because bats fly and throw the faeces everywhere, it same with Bird Flu cases.MERS is caused by unwell camel cooked, if well cooked is totally not harmful. So it is same with eat unwell pig cooked, so can get tapeworms disease, although it is not virus. Cook well is safe for everything.Until nowadays there are no definitely caused of nCov2019."
"All SARS, MERS and nCov2019 are Corona Virus with different strain."
"Re Post #20 The Guardian reports like other coronaviruses, this strain has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts.Edited: 12:44 am, February 03, 2020 "
"Bali Hotels Association would like to update our members and travel industry partners on the situation in Bali related to the novel corona virus outbreak in China.The WHO declared the novel corona virus a public health emergency of international concern, as this would allow the WHO to better coordinate the international response and hold nations to account if they overstep the organization's standards -- which may pertain to travel, trade, quarantine or screening.To date, based on reports from the Bali Department of Health, there are no confirmed cases in Bali. Preventative measures have been in place for quite some time to alleviate any risk of the novel corona virus spreading in Bali.The Bali Hotels Association (BHA) has maintained close contact and communications with the Bali Department of Tourism and Health, and all member hotels have enacted strict controls to guard against any risk of contamination. The best source of current and accurate information on the novel corona virus is the World Health Organization (WHO), BHA is checking with the WHO regularly to ensure that we have the latest facts on hand.The Chinese Government recently imposed a ban on tour groups travelling overseas and the booking of flights and hotels abroad to try to stem the spread of the virus, forcing thousands of Chinese tourists to cancel their plans. The situation remains a challenge for many in the industry worldwide. The risk to travelers outside of China is actually quite minimal. Please visit the website at www.who.int for the most up to date information.Bali Hotels Association had sent updates and recommendations for its hotel members on prevention measures . The WHO’s standard recommendations for the general public to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses including the novel corona virus include hand and respiratory hygiene as well as safe food practices. BHA is continuously monitoring the situation and will update its members on any changes when available. Bali Hotels Association"
Thank you BHA. Good to hear. Let's hope this passes quickly as I'm sure it's impacting your members.
"Hi,Looks like Indonesia is banning arrivals from Mainland China.https:/…Cheers"
"Latest DFAT update: Due to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China, Indonesian authorities will temporarily deny entry and transit to foreign nationals who have been in mainland China during the last 14 days from 5 February. Indonesia will also temporarily stop direct flights to and from mainland China from 5 February. Check arrangements with your airlines or transport provider and follow the advice of local authority.https:/…indonesiaEdited: 3:25 am, February 03, 2020 "
"It's good to see that Indonesia is also temporarily not issuing visas to mainland Chinese residents, or people who have been there in the last 14 days. Also good that the Chinese government is preventing tour groups from leaving China. Hopefully they can prevent this becoming a pandemic."
"yes im hearing you, we booked for the 2nd time now ! last time we couldnt go due to volcano.We booked for Mid March, my hubby swaying towards not worth the risk"
"In the last 4 days in Mainland China, there are no increase of growth of 2019-nCov positive means there are new positive patients, but the number is decreasing. 2 possibilities, if the tend continue is good means under control, or it is only a rest and then increase again. In outside of Mainland China, certainly is more controllable."
"Hi SherylOf course it’s not worth proceeding with your trip if your husband is so worried as that would spoil the holiday. It really is a situation where you’ll need to make your own decisions after weighing up the issues.Seems that this virus has popped up in some very unexpected places, though. Who would ever have thought that someone could get infected while on a ski trip in France?"
"Hello guys, we have a plan to visit bali on 19th feb. We 8 people including 2 kids under 3 yrs. Please suggest whether to proceed or not. We won't get any refund of flight cancellations though life is more important than money."
"It would be very unwise for any lay person to advise you on this matter. Other travellers are proceeding with their plans.Edited: 5:43 pm, February 15, 2020 "

"Hi rakeshkumar and welcome to Trip AdvisorAs baliAustralia says, it would be unwise for any of us to have influencing input to your decision.Although I realise that you would prefer to be led in this regard, this is one time when you will have to decide for yourself."
"If you finally decide to go to Bali, use a mask and gloves, wash your hands often..."
"Dear Jan did you go to Bali, could you tell me about the situation there and is it safe to travel. I am visiting on the 8th March."
"Hi did you travel to Bali, I am also planning to visit bali on 8th March, is it safe to travel?"
"Indonesia is vast like India. In Jakarta, capital city of Indonesia, almost there are no people wearing mask. If in Delhi there are many people wearing mask means Jakarta is better than Delhi, if in Delhi almost there are no people wearing mask means Delhi same with Jakarta."
"Hi GarvitOf course you would be aware that there are a few people in India who have been diagnosed with this virus, so why are you afraid that you might catch it somewhere else?"
"Well there have been some suspected cases, and people have died, but apparently they tested negative for Covid-19."
"Today, Indonesia evacuates 68 Indonesian crews of Diamond Princess in Japan. It is the latest group have been evacuated, however there are still crews to maintain the cruise ship.Indonesia seems very carefully to evacuates them to make sure there are healthy or maybe in the incubation period. Previously there are no one of Indonesian crews get infected of Covid-19. Then there are 2 Indonesian crews get it when I post previously. But at the moment there are 9 Indonesian crew get it, but one of them get well. If Indonesian too soon to evacuate them, maybe there are positive patient of Covid-19 in Indonesia. Seems is hard to believe, but Indonesia must protect more than 260 million people and they are not same, some very afraid, some rational, some does not matter with the virus.So one ship from Australia has visited Indonesia in East Nusa Tenggara, but when the ship want to visit Alor, the Regent refused it."
"I will be interested to see how many of the ship's crew they actually test, given they have only tested 132 people to date"
"There are many kinds of test, test of Corona Virus or not, if yes test of Covid-19, maybe it is Covid-19, but maybe other corona viruses. It is for who ill or suspect. Indonesia has not so many suspects, so certainly not many test of Covid-19, but test of Corona Virus or not can be confirmed more than test of Covid-19 in number. Indonesia has made own reagent of Covid-19, not many countries can do it, even more modern countries.For who are health, but that are possibility in incubation period as crews of cruise ships, the test is Polymerase Chain Reaction to know negative of virus or not. Before evacuate to Indonesia they get one test of PCR in Japan. Certainly Indonesia do not want evacuate its citizens with the positive virus. Please remember that until nowadays has no positive Covid-19 patient in Indonesia. One other test of PCR when they will be quarantined/observed and the last test of PCR when they will be released from the quarantine/observe.I think Indonesia do more than WHO Protocol."
Agreed Luigi.In addition Victoria's latest case to come out of Iran reportedly travelled via KL and Bali whilst feeling unwell.
"Two recorded cases out of West Java now, traced to a Japanese man who was diagnosed in Malaysia."
Perhaps the cat is finally out of the bag now that media reports 3 people today tested positve in singapore after visiting Batam bring total number to 7....not including the Singaporean who died in Batam and was buried the next day under police observance. The positive patients had visited Batam mid February.
"Hi JanYour head must be spinning after reading all sorts of information, some of it conflicting. I suppose the decision as to whether to proceed or postpone your trip will rest entirely in your lap as nobody else can decide that for you. I did however wonder where you are currently and whether or not there have been any confirmed cases of the virus there. If so, then it probably doesn’t make any difference to your level of safety at home or travelling.Edited: 6:33 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Despite conflicting information, and whether Indonesia or Bali is doing a good enough job of checking/reporting or not, given the number of Ozzie tourists visiting Bali weekly I'm pretty sure if there was an Ozzie infected in Bali and brought it back to Australia we would surely know about it. The Australian authorities would want to know where he/she caught it/where they stayed/flight details/possible contact."
2 cases of corona virus have now been reported in Jakarta. Actually it's probably elsewhere as well. But I'm not going to let it cancel my travel plans in two weeks. If I were taking children I would probably think differently
Possibly some travellers are hesitant to report any symptoms knowing full well they and their loved ones would be staring down the barrell at a possible and enforced lengthy quarantine.
Those 2 cases above were transiting only.

"I am going to Bali on Sunday and hesitant to go because my travel insurance will not cover me for coronavirus. But, given the number of people flying back from Bali each week into Australia, (approx 25000 but maybe less now) if someone had it then we would have possibly known by now."
"We're the same, we fly out on Friday.I feel the way Australian media has been reporting on Indonesia, we'd hear cases if Australians were returning home with the virus."

"I've been travelling Asia since Dec 8. I'm in Bali now. I honestly dont think you should cancel. I made a little 9 minute vlog about what I've seen and my thoughts on going vs cancelling. If you have a few min... Take a look. Hope it helpshttps://youtu.be/SdZzhd1yH6YP.S. What did you hope to get out of Bali, because I must say it was not what I expected"
"Thank you for the vlog, Mickey.As an aside and out of pure curiosity, what did you expect that Bali would be and in which way has that differed from the reality?"
"Honestly from everything Ive seen online, i expected beautiful beaches. Oceans you can swim in. What I found is poluted dirty oceans full of plastic and garbage. And where the beaches were beautiful, the tides were too high to swim. Every 12 steps, someone is yelling ""Taxi"" in my ear. No is not a word in their vocabulary. The one smart thing I did here was get InDriver before I arrived. Taxi drivers at the airport wanted 500,000 IDR to get me to Ubud. Grab wanted 450,000. INDRIVER WAS 180,000. The taxi drivers at the airport said ""thats not a real price... Thats on a bike"" but the guy came with his car. Drove us for an hour and a half, and thats what I paid. Also bring some cash. ATMs dont always work. Convert it next to where all the taxi drivers bombard you"
"The Indonesian government is actually pretty well on top of it and have contained all know cases, Un- like Australia where sick people are free to stay home and go to the local Woolworths to buy a trolley full of toilet paper. The worse place to be these days is in a hospital waiting room https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbe…"
"Mickey,Can you tell me more about INDriver?"
"I agree, our local doctor friend recommends that we stay away from hospitals and pharmacies. However, not sure that I agree that the Indonesian government is on top of things. I think they may have acted quite late in blocking flights from Singapore and Malaysia. But anyway, lots of people are being tested at the moment in Java."
"InDriver is like grab or Uber, the difference is instead of you requesting a ride and going with the first drover that says yes, you make an offer of what you want to pay. Then drivers offer you a ride. The best part? You can pick the driver. It shows who's closest and a driver can make a counter offer if your price is too low. About 30% cheaper than grab or Uber."
"I love it! Thanks for the tip - This is awesome, Mickey!Were they able to pick you up easily from the airport or did you have to meet somewhere a bit out of the way? I know I've read from others that airport pickup was a bit difficult using Grab. Also, do they have credit card as a payment option or is it just cash?"
"Glad I could help. It was cash only. When you leave the main airport doors, you cross the street and there is a ""Grab lounge"" close to the currency converter. They picked me up from there. Be aware that it's ""against the rules"" to use rideshare like grab in Ubud. It didn't stop the driver from dropping us off, but I have no idea how it will be to leave using one as I'm still here."
""" I think they may have acted quite late in blocking flights from Singapore and Malaysia."" Has any country in the world banned flights from those 2 countries?"
"My impression of the beaches is the same but, fortunately, I didn't have great expectations about them. Thanks for the clue on INDriver."
Now thats sensible common sense information!
"Jat, sorry if l sound ignorant but why should they block flights from Singapore or Malaysia? In so doing they might as well block flights from the entire world."
"Sorry Janice, I was quoting from & replying to SurfingWild post #71. There is no suggestion and little liklihood of Indonesia banning flights from Singapore or MalaysiaEdited: 8:39 am, March 08, 2020 "
"Oh my hat you gave me such a fright, lm on Singapore Airlines next week and hope to arrive in Bali before they ban any airlines."
"Related to #72:InDriver not exploiting poor people. Gojek and Grab deduct the money from its driver 20 percent for using the application. Several hours ago I used InDriver and I offer Rp 15,000. If it is too low InDriver will mentions that the quote is too low. There are only one driver accept it and need 10 minutes to arrive. The driver is from Cirebon as GoCar from Gojek driver previously, but nowdays try as driver of InDriver and he mentioned get more with InDriver compare to GoCar. InDriver not deduct anything from the driver, so we can offer 20 percent lower than Grab and Gojek. I paid him Rp 25,000, because the car is very clean. So, he at least get Rp 20 percent of Rp 15,000 = Rp 3,000 + Rp 10,000 = Rp 13,000 additional payment than join with Grab or Gojek.In Bekasi needs 10 minutes to wait for InDriver, but in Bandung needs only 5 minutes and sometimes only 3 minutes same as GoJek or Grab."
"Indonesia has banned visitors from Main Land China, Italy, South Korea and Japan.WHO has given appreciation to China and Singapore to overcome Covid-19. So, there are only minimum possibility to ban Singapore.Instead of Singapore, transit can be done at KL or Bangkok. From USA can transit at Taipei, Taiwan."
SarwaThank you for your input on INDriver
"You're welcome Cat S.In the Airport is Grab Airport and is different with Grab Regular outside of the airport. Grab Airport is more expensive than Grab Regular. In Bali you can easily go to outside of the airport, but you cannot do it in vast Jakarta Cengkareng Airport.As I know the most expensive fee of InDriver is 12 percent, but I forgot the country. Fee has many variation and usually from Zero to 8 percent, still lower than Grab and Gojek, because as passengers we cannot monitor where is the driver, because no map for it, but it is benefit for the driver, because local mafia taxi/rent car cannot detect the driver and passenger locations.InDriver has stopped to recruit new rider/driver."
