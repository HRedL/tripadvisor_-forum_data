"Hello,We are from Hobart and are planning on travelling to the NT for the first time with our two kids (10 & 11) and just wondering the best way to travel. We will have 3 weeks in September next year.We would like to include Darwin, Kakadu, Alice Springs, Uluru, and Coober Pedy. Any other suggestions would be great!At first we thought the Ghan might be good, but have read some bad reviews ( I.e. not good value for money).Taking into consideration the the long distances, I thought flying to Alice Springs, hiring a car to see Uluru etc., then flying to Darwin and hiring a car again (or similar) might be a good way.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Cheers"
"Yes car and fly is far better. Train means you still have to have transport when you get off or do Ghan tours. Prob not aimed at the kiddos. But I havent done the train. The Alice to Darwin leg is overnight so you dont see much.Your plan is fine to fly to Alice and do a loop trip of say 7-10 days. Your kids are a good age for hikes so you can include the east and west Macs. Coober pedy is a fair drive south so you would have to decide if it worth it. Flying from Alice is then 2 hours as opposed to 15 hours drive. Your loop then in Darwin could be easily 10-12 days. Kakadu, Litchfield , Katherine, maybe Dundee beach or a trip to Tiwi. You could do a 4 we camper in both locations so you dont miss any of the stuff off the bitumen.Sept in the Centre is lovely, but getting warmer in the top."
"Thanks for the info. I see you live in Darwin, so even better!Yes, when I looked into the Ghan it seemed to be more popular for retirees (although our son loves trains).My husband suggested the Tiwi Islands, so will look into that as well.I will also look into a camper van (was planning on hiring a 4WD and staying places as we moved around).We have always wanted to go to the NT, so very excited!Thanks again."
"You may also want to think about driving from Alice and return the vehicle in Darwin. This gives you some more opportunity to maybe get off the beaten track . What you would lay in a one way hire fee you would “save” in airfare from Alice to Darwin. Many people say its an infintely long and boring drive. Yes, jts long, but as I said opens up some more opportunities along the way. The benefits of 4wd are that you then dont need to pay for tours to access things you can reach yourself. Some tours are still worthwhile doing though like Animal Tracks , a few of the cruises in Kakadu , or Pudakul which is Aboriginal / cultural. Hopefully they will all be able to survive Covid. Thee is lots of family orientated experiences whether it be cyclng around Uluru or animal spotting cruises, airboats etc. mine are happy mucking around in rock pools etc."
"I like the idea of hiring a car in AS and returning it in Darwin. It is a long drive from As to Darwin, but there are some attractions along the way worth seeing. Coober Pedy is so unique that it is worth a long detour from Erldunda. You would need to stay in Coober Pedy for at least one night."
Yep about 7 hrs just drive time one way from AS and same road return.
"I would recommend your suggestion of flying to Alice, hiring a car for a central Australian loop then flying to Darwin and doing the same for the Top End. Yes you will miss a couple of things in between, but not much.Better to focus your time where the attractions are and not have to worry about potential one way hire fees. My parents did the Ghan and honestly found it a bit boring, and they are both the target market of retirees. Given that I’m not sure I’d try it with kids."
"Shaz and Hami has absolutely nailed it.The Ghan (or any of the Journey Beyond trains), aren’t geared at all for children. After over 80 trips to DRW, I can count the number of times I’ve seen children onboard on one hand.Not only is it poor value for the kids, it’s poor value all round for families with kids, as there are no cabins that can accommodate all four of you. This would mean you’ll be paying for two cabins.That and the fact that there’s almost zero activities onboard for children, it’s an expensive experience."
"3 weeks is actually enough time to do a road trip from Alice Springs to Darwin as well as spend a lot of time at each destination. However, by flying and hiring a car at both Alice Springs and Darwin, you can have the nice option have some car free days to laze around the resort, join a tour or visit an island."
So we dont fill people with false hope Roy- what resorts and islands are you referring to?
