hi will be visiting gambia again at the end of year... may i ask has anybody cancelled there trip due to ebola outbreak in west africa??
Hi KarenI have trips planned for Nov/Dec and again in January. I wont be cancelling unless I am advised to by the Foreign OfficeRgdsHaydn
I have booked for Nov through to March and I will be going. Check the thread Ebola Again for more views.
I am keeping a close watch on the situation as I have a trip booked for 17th Dec for a month but unless the FCO say don't go or T.Cook decide not to operate I am currently still planning to go
"Thank you, yes that's what I am doing, foreign office, and Thomas cook. Do you mind if I ask .has everybody had yellow fever injections?"
whats yellow fever got to do with Ebola ?????? Nothing!
Me and all my family have had it. It is not regulation but can affect if going to visit other countries. My son has just been to Egypt and needed to show a certificate as he has visited Gambia recently. Many other countries insist if you have visited an area they classify as at risk of Yellow Fever that you have a certificate of vaccination before they allow you entry.
You only need have yellow fever jab if your travelling to Gambia from a country that has yellow fever.That obviously doesn't apply to the UK.Edited: 6 years ago 
"Hi Karen, you don't have to get the yellow fever vacc but it's advised. I did as I would rather be safe than sorry, think it lasts for ten years so cheap at half the price. Plenty on here will advise against it though. Happy holiday, I'm back in march."
Yellow fever is not advised if you're over 60 or with low immunity as it uses live virus and the vaccination can actually give you the full-blown disease. An exemption certificate can be obtained. Vaccinations also contain heavy metals and up to very recently contained mercury (thimerosal) as an anti-bacterial. The flu vaccine still contains mercury apparently but others use aluminium nowadays from what I recall. I wouldn't allow this in my body unless absolutely essential.
I phoned Thomas cook yesterday as we go in January. The lady said they had nothing off Foreign Office about stopping people going if they do they will get in touch with people to let them know. So until the foreign office says anything we still going in January.
"I have a trip booked for January and, as everyone else has said, won't be cancelling unless FO advise or TC don't fly. Regarding Yellow fever though, I went to The Gambia in January and again in February of last year then went to Egypt in July and no-one asked for YF certificate (good job because I haven't had it!)"
"The only problem with relying on the foreign office is that obviously they only issue directives after the event (IE reactive), so be prepared to be in TG and Ebola to break out there before flights are even considered to be banned. For instance, I stopped going to Kenya as soon as I was concerned about terrorist attacks, but the FO advice is still only to avoid certain areas of Kenya. It's a personal decision but I would not rely on the FO to be proactive."
"Hi Paul,BBC is the one to check out..!!"
"Excellent point, paulukascot.- people seem to have a blind faith in Foreign Office advice ."
"Karen,I will be Driving down in a Convoy, hopefully Sept to Dec..If anyone's want's to use 2 Van's, I will have I'll be Driving the Third one."
Well said!!!!
Woman vomits and collapses and dies on Gambia Bird... not ebola apparently:dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2715158/Ebola-s…
It does beg the question though why flights are still allowed from Sierra Leone to the UK. If that woman had had Ebola they had also let all passengers and staff leave the airport before diagnosis. HMG are well behind the curve IMO.
"Gambia reliance on tourism is paramount, enough said."
HiThe situation with Gambiabird is that they are (supposedly) only stopping at Freetown to drop passengers both outbound and inbound nonsense really an infected person could get off at Lungi airport having infected others on the plane proceeding elsewhere Im sure that some ground staff must come onboard alsoHowever most major airlines are operating normally The BA schedule UK/Freetown is flying as normal rgds
"Hiya!!I was thinking the same thing..as I leave on 21 November for ten nights.. So, I called Olympic Holidays today and they said they will only cancel trips under instruction from the Foreign Office. There have been no cases of Ebola being in the Gambia, as yet. If you have booked your ticket or holiday and they do have to cancel I'm pretty sure that you will be reimbursed with all the money you've paid. However, if you decide, yourself, not to go, due to concerns then of course you would not have your ticket refunded.With regards to Yellow Fever injections. I have been to Gambia twice in the last twelve months ...and when I was investigating what vaccinations i needed, there were so many conflicting opinions that I just went with my gut feeling which was to take the precautionary approach and I had all of them done inc. Yellow Fever and Rabies. It just gave me peace of mind, especially as I always travel solo ( through choice).If youre interested in Malaria tablet advice. I took Malarone, that I gto through a Travel Doctor in London and was very worried about side effects. I had none.....in fact I felt really well on them and slept really well with lovely dreams. But that's just my experience and everyone is different...But this forum is fantastic for getting well rounded and informed responses to your questions..so do ask away.Lets hope with all our might that the Ebola disaster gets under some sort of control as soon as possible and never reaches the Gambia. how devastating it could be for the lovely local Gambians and all the othe people who live and work there.If you do decide to go have a wonderful adventure......"

"hi everyone,I m hoping to go to gambia in november,so at the moment i m just watching how things are going and will judge for myself .I would advise anyone who wants a fuller picture to look on the msf website.Also as they are a charity totally reliant on private donations and appear to be the only ones doing anything practical to try to stop the spread of ebola,I would beg people to support them."

"Crikey Paul,Just read your link...thanksIts an uphill battle."
There are posters graphical on Ebola risks symptom and transmission in upstairs restaurant in Banjul airport but not many go up there!

"Here s a link to a poster showing the do`s and don`ts for the prevention of Ebola VirusI asked a question on Facebook ""wondering if there is any public information in The Gambia"" The reply was someone has seen a poster in the upstairs cafe at Banjul Airport.Lets all take responsibility by sharing this this poster........""Every little helps""cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/ebolaposter_dosanddont…"
"ps, the phone number on the bottom of the poster does not relate to The Gambia....These are posters being used in the affected Countries You can get more information by going to Public Health England website"

"Tapalapa, have not seen that poster but we have a different one from the Government, and all clinical staff are being alerted to the dangers. In our area at least"
"Point 2.3 below from that WHO link IMO shows the WHO to be complacent IMO by saying risk is 'VERY LOW' as we have already a passenger (Mr Sawyer) that infected at least 10 people when he travelled to Nigeria in July, and at least 3 have since died. One passenger that died was sitting next to him:' 2.3. Patients travelling with symptoms and fellow travellersThere is a possibility that a person who had been exposed to Ebola virus and developed symptoms may board a commercial flight, or other mode of transport, without informing the transport company of his status. It is highly likely that such patients would seek immediate medical attention upon arrival, especially if well informed, and then should be isolated to prevent further transmission. Although the risk to fellow travellers in such a situation is very low, contact tracing is recommended in such circumstances. 'Edited: 6 years ago "

thanks for pointing that out paul ascot.It looks as if the passenger was his colleague assistant but reading the rest (news reports and blogs ) i got bogged down in the lies and more damned lies.Were people in high places pressuring/ enabling him to travel to the conference knowing he may have ebola ? The disease is so scary but the responses are also scary.I think you are doing the right thing in giving it a miss.I am still to decide but i dont relish the idea of following the posters advise to check for non apparent symptoms before shaking hands with every child who offers their hand.
An interesting article on the devastating effects on quarantined villages in Liberia and movement controls likened to those under the Plague. independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/ebola-ou…
"This is just a thought,for the people who are travelling to Gambia it would do no harm to take a few bottles of hand sanitiser with you,the pound shop is selling large bottles of the gel at the moment,it would not only be a nice gift for your friends in Gambia but would also help stop the spread of any diseases."
"The most graphic description of Ebola I've read yet !!' The tropical pathogen can turn people into de facto corpses with little higher brain function and negligible motor control days before they die.The virus attacks almost every section of tissue, reducing organs and flesh in the most aggressive infections to a pudding-like mush which leaches or erupts from the body.'https:/…OBTQ5L8"
"Paul, we already know its awful and dreadful at its worst ...I wonder if you would consider removing your post as unneccessarily distressing for a general forum?And before you say it, even more distressing where it is ..."
"Been on top of this, as family out in The Gambia.There has been a lot of scaremongering by the media. West Africa is huge, and Gambia very far away from the ebola infected regions, but of course, they have to dramatise their broadcasts, and term it ""west Africa"" - They must have dodged all their geography lessons However, the Gambian government has done an amzing job in sensitising the nation, and put rigid controls in the borders.Be asured, Gambia is safeAlHamdulAlla as the say in The Gambia"
I would go with foreign office. BBC ? They think West Africa is a country; very misleading - scaremongers.
"They term it west africa because that is where any atlas says it is, nothing to do with missing geography lessons. Gambia is a small densely populated strip of land in global terms in the same region as the affected countries, and with porous borders. Like their neighbors gambia has a poor standard of medical expertise and an ill educated population. Nothing to do with dramatised broadcasts just facts people need to be aware of."
"Well said Banjulbert,couldnt have put it better myself.Keep watching the news and keep on top of the crisis.I also have family in Gambia,my wife has the same attitude as diskette that it miles from Gambia so i have to put her right."
"It's a few others that require geography lessons !! ;0)The distance from infected Conakry to Dakar is 435 miles, so just over 350 miles to Banjul, which is roughly the distance of London to Newcastle. The distance from the northernmost point of the outbreak in Guinea in Telimele region to the much nearer eastern end of The Gambia region is only about 150 miles, so this would appear to be the most vulnerable point IMO.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Rigorous controls at the border last i heard they were taking temperatures with an underarm thermometer that was not washed let alone sterilised as it went from armpit to armpit....... Think people should be very careful shouting that the BBC and people are scaremongering. When you see what has happened in Liberia with total lack of knowledge i think it far wiser to make the people of Gambia very aware of the potential this virus has to cause them a lot of bother and quite rightly so as the region i am working in helping with their clinic etc is less than 200 miles away..................... from the starting point of this outbreak. I wonder how many people have to die and exactly how close, before you actually believe their is a problem Diskette? Sadly there will be many more 100's of deaths if not 1000's and many people trying to leave their quarantined areas and go to where there is no Ebola... at the moment."
Be careful thinking hand sanitisers can kill the Ebola virus..It isnt really designed for viruses..more specifically for bacteria...
"We know NOTHING kills Ebola, but anything that can help with the hygiene be it soap and water or hand gel is a big help."

"Tests for the Ebola virus are being carried out on the body of a man in a County Donegal hospital, the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) has said.It is understood the man's body was brought to Letterkenny General Hospital on Thursday. He had suffered what are described as Ebola-like symptoms.He had recently returned from Sierra Leone."
Hopefully TC wont cancel your trip for you Chris v.
Your correct Angler29...Hand sanitiser is a good thing to take but mentioning it on the Ebola thread might just give less informed travellers a false sense of security. The only guaranteed way to not catch mit is to avoid contact.
"Senegal closes border with Guinea rather belatedly IMO, and the World Health Organisation criticises the measure !!! You could not make it up !! www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28893835Edited: 6 years ago "
HiThe Irish Health Service Executive has reported that tests on the body of the man who died at Letterkenny Hospital shortly after returning from Sierra Leone have proven negative for Ebola rgds
"Sounds as if it was malaria in the Irish case, which apparently they were treating him for. However, tests on some people have been negative for them later to be diagnosed positive, as in one case that killed many nurses, as they thought they were not treating an Ebola patient, so took no precautions. Incidentally, South Africa has now banned flights from infected countries."
Completely depends on whether you believe anything any government tells you.
"So true Rockman. An example is the news from Nigeria today that stated a further five cases of Ebola, quickly denied by another item of news from the Nigerian Government !!! As a cynic I wonder whether they are trying underhand methods not to get on the 'flights banned list' of various countries !! Oh, and now I see this :https:/…no0fe53"
Just checking the Ebola cases in Guinea and notice that the area around Pita has confirmed cases and very close to that is the source of the River Gambia.

"Gambia on high alert for Ebola outbreakGambia's ministry of health and social welfare said on Thursday that it is on high alert for a possible Ebola outbreak in the country and are taking preventive measures to tackle the disease.Modou Njai, director of health promotion and education at the ministry, said that so far there has been no confirmed case of the Ebola virus disease in Gambia, Xinhua reported.""Currently there are public health officials stationed at all the border entry points, including at the airport and seaport and we are also increasing our surveillance teams countrywide to ensure that those going in and out are properly checked for Ebola virus,"" Njai said.According to Njia, 210 technical advisory committee members, 350 Red Cross volunteers, 75 local government authorities, 75 cluster monitors, 25 health journalists have been sensitised, including 36 representatives of youth groups who has been sent to various settlements in the country to sensitise people about the disease.The preventive measures taken by the Gambia's public health officials include reading passengers' temperature and asking about their travel history. The public health officials are also in touch with regional health management teams posted in various regions, Njia added.Gambia's regional management teams coordinate and supervise surveillance teams posted to various locations in the country.According to the World Health Organisation, the death toll due to the Ebola virus continues to rise in West Africa and currently stands at 1,350.…in.com/news/…493509-17.html"

"Not wanting to minimise the seriousness of Ebola or the threat to West Africa it represents but I understand that one health worker from Sierra Leone I believe, has been taken back to the UK after contracting Ebola. That means that the UK has more cases of Ebola than The Gambia. I also read that he is responding well to treatment and of course the UK has better facilities to isolate and treat patients."
"Ahem.... but that person did not catch Ebola in the UK, which you are insinuating. Rather disingenuous methinks."
I have heard that Thomas cook are cancelling all their flights but not telling their passengers is this true? has anyone else heard this or is it just a rumour. I was about to book our flights for November but am unsure now what to do
Also CNN reporting first case in Senegal
we have not cancelled but equally we have not booked our. nov flights yet which we normally do in april....its looking less likely with day that passes that we will travel this year..
"hi all thank you all for your messages , just had email from t cook our flight has been cancelled on 25th jan from manchester.......what are your feelings on ebola know beeing in senegale. has this put anybody off going to gambia. dont no weither to change date or find new destination x"
Can't go to a different destination unless Thomas Cook themselves cancel. Would lose too much money already paid out. I'm not trying to make light of this terrible disease but I have researched as much as I can and been in touch with various people too and you cannot 'catch' ebola from someone in anothet country. You have to be in direct contact with someone suffering the symptons and as I don't intend to be then I still feel safe. I think it's going to have a very bad effect on tourism in TG this season and I'm worried for the Gambians who will struggle to feed their families.
"No ebola known of in Senegal as of yesterday. the person has recovered enough and their 'contacts have all been checked.Having said that, it would be prudent as it is for us who live in TG to keep up to date every day monitering bbc al jaz and senegal news.i advise come, TC cancelling flights is as far as I know at the mo, unrelated to Ebolacheers"
So happy the person in Senegal is getting better. Feel so bad for citizens of gambia with all the flights being cancelled as a lot of people work in hotels and tourism.
"Karen m all sunday flights are cancelled to Banjul fortwith from Manchester and also i believe Gatwick.,im going out on Weds Jan 21st from Manchester but i'm not holding my breath. The tourism this year is going to be non existent,most Scandanavian countries have stopped flights completly,i just hope they get this problem sorted asap because 1 case in Gambia and no ones going because the home office and TC will pull the plug."
"Hi angler29, as I said only had email today, when I rang I was told only flight that week was 24th Jan from manchester. With a few places left????? A few flights up to 28days after but have to ring Monday as there computers were down today. Also given option to cancel hols or pick different destination. But nobody seems to no why so many flights are cancelled from manchester and Gatwick. Not sure what to do yet?."
"Perhaps the flights are cancelled because of lack of enough new bookings. I have been to the Gambia a couple of times and love the place, but I would not make a fresh booking at present, as insurance companies may not give cover if medical evacuation is needed because of Ebola should it affect Gambia. Cover is very unlikely to be needed, I accept, but if it is needed it would be extrememly expensive.We are booked on cruise due to visit Dakar, Banjul and a couple of Cape Verde ports in December. It looks as though the itinerary will be changed in some way as Cape Verde are not accepting non nationals who have visited Ebola affected countries, (including Seegal), in the previous 30 days. At least we booked a long time ago, so Ebola would not have been considered a risk at that stage, so we should be covered by insurance if needed - might just check that though!If the FCO advise against travel in the future, then insurance companies will not give cover so the operators will have to pull out altogether. That could be another reason why operators will be reducing flights to areas that may become affected in the future as it could limit any possible losses which could arise later in the season. They had a lot of losses due to the arab spring and ongoing events since then.I am very sorry for the Gambian people who are lovely and in great need, but I feel a lot of travel will be cancelled because of lack of business as well as any real fear of the virus. Then again, perhaps having less travel this year may help tourism in the future if the situation is brought under control. If you consider a cruise ship going from Dakar to Banjul, it could become a big infection risk for those countries as well as for the passengers.I am not happy with the situation though, either for our holiday plans or the people of Africa or anywhere else that becomes affected - especially for those who are ill or will get ill in the future. I do realise that there are no cases of Ebola in Gambia at present and hopefully there will not be any, but there will be a perceived risk.What I do not understand is why there are not big appeals for money and fundraising events being held as the doctors working in the affected countries all seem to be saying that the facilities are just not adequate in the badly affected areas."
"Great post TringWirral_England, it makes a lot of sense. West Africa as a region will feel the economic effect for time to come."
just back from gambia. all this scare mongering is going to have a impact on there tourism. yes people have to take precautions but it isnt there yet. the goverment has a lot of things in place if it does hit there. posters are up to warn people. they are ready unlike s leone that didnt have that chance.
"You may be concerned about the consequences on Gambia from declining tourism numbers as a result of scare mongering,but there certain individuals on this Forum who clearly are not,because they continually are doing it."
"Hi Annabelle,What kind of things have been put in place ? is there any kind of screening at the airport ?"
The latest on Senegal is that 67 contacts of the student are being monitored but none are positive for Ebola as of yet:who.int/csr/…
gambians i know are aware of ebola. they have a hotline number that they can call for info if they are not sure. posters are up.didnt see any screening. some of them know the season is going to be affected with it. they ask why when it not here. they dont fully understand the impact it will have.
"Thanks Annabelle,Do you or anyone else know if the situation is having a negative impact on Guineans in Gambia in any way ?"
Hi tringwirrel we decided to cancel gambia as tcook could not be certain there could be flights. It was also difficult to change holidays due to work commitment.it was very difficult to speak to somebody as had to reply in email first then wait for a call back. I'm very sad about cancellation as we love too take presents for the schools and children ... let's hope all is going to be well in gambia and all of west africa. Looks like goa or the Caribbean for us this January.
"Hi Karen MI'm really sad to hear that - and thought I'd mention that Gambia Experiance are still reliably booking for Gambia - I know a few posters here have rebooked with them. They have no planned changes to flights- that's if it's just the unreliability that has prompted your decision. Also GambiaBird is still regularly flying.I know this may change if the dreaded ""E"" gets to Gambia, but I firmly believe Gambia is taking all the precautions they can to keep it out."
"Just got following email from Gambia Experience, I normally use them:We hope you are looking forward to your forthcoming trip to The Gambia on the 19/12/2014. No doubt you will have seen on the news recently, some countries in West Africa are affected by the Ebola virus. We are happy to report that The Gambia has no confirmed cases and the government is taking stringent measures to help ensure this situation does not change. As part of these measures, travel restrictions have been put in place and travellers will not be allowed entry into The Gambia if they have visited Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone within 21 days of their intended arrival.  We welcome these changes as it provides continued protection against Ebola spreading into the country. Should you have any further questions, please refer to the ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ section on our website and if you have visited one of the affected countries listed above within 21 days of your planned arrival into The Gambia, please contact our administration team on 0845 330 2044, so we can advise you further of your options.  May we take this opportunity to wish you a safe and pleasant trip to The Gambia.  Yours sincerely   Customer Relations"
I'm sad.as well I still would of been happy to visit gambia but my sister and friend decided they didn't want to go. Even though I have been to gambia twice I didn't want to go by myself x
We were going on dec 26 but T cook have cancelled that flight ( not enough takers I presume).They offered two other dates neither which we can do. The best bit is though we can go on a monarch flight same day ( charted by gambia experience )for an extra £600. they are having a laugh.Edited: 5 years ago 
Please remember that it is easy for G EX to say they have no planned changes to their flights as they have no aircraft.All their clients are put on Thomas cook Monarch or Germania flights.They have no control over the flights so if one of the carriers pull the plug you could find yourself in the same situation again.
"I'm so frustrated at the mo, we also were booked on the 26th and have been told our flights have been cancelled. We were offered Monday 22nd or 29th but cannot do either as of work commitments, so we have had to cancel. We booked with JLM and they have verbally told me the flights have been cancelled and told me to out in writing (email) which I have done, but I have heard nothing from them since 11am today. I've sent Thomas Cook an email requesting a refund for the 'extra's' - seat allocation ect and they have said that the flight is still going ahead - its not cancelled.....I'm just wanting my money back for flights they have cancelled....I cant help that due to work commitments I can;t make the flight, I would have loved to have gone....it's too much hassle now, this is just the booking stage!!! I'll go elsewhere...."
"If TC have offered you an alternative booking within a time date I don't think your entitled to a refund,read the small print, you will however be able to claim on your holiday insurance."
If the change is more than 12 hours you are entitled to a full refund with Thos Cook.
"Sorry you needed to cancel Karen, I hope you find something else suitable. We are still waiting to hear about a change in the cruise schedule, but at least there will still be a holiday. We are retired now so are able to go away fairly often and without restrictions which is good for us.Angler29 I think you will find that if a tour operator changes a date, (as long as the flight time has changed by more than 12 hours from the original flight time), it is a significant change, so you are entitled to a full refund of the package holiday, (or flight only), as booked.If cancellation is for a reason beyond the tour operator's control, then I do not think you would be entitled to any extra compensation or the cost of any extras you have booked separately, (e.g. airport parking or hotels). It is times like this that booking a package holiday has considerable advantages. Of course if the holiday is cancelled by the customer without there being a significant change, then you would loose deposit or more according to the T&C's.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Tring- I think your right, though I did read somewhere something about additional expenses could be claimed and refunded if the changes were more than 70 days b4 flight- which makes me wonder if TC are holding off notifying people for this reason.Makes some sense of the complete customer relations nightmare possibly??"
"Can't remember all the nitty gritty like that and my extremely reliable 'advisor' is working away this week.One other thing that concerns me though is that someone said you can claim on travel insurance - to do that you would have to have a reason not to travel like being ill yourself. Some insurance policies now can cover other parts of a booking - for instance if you book a flight and hotel as individual bookings - but not all policies cover this sort of thing so it is always worth looking at the details of an insurance policy before taking it on.My 'advisor' is very unpopular when picking up a car for instance, as all the small print has to be read before anything is signed. Could be considered a professional disadvantage in that sort of instance, but at least I know we will not be caught out. You are right companies are not actually user friendly.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Hi Rockman. Its always been my understanding that the Monarch and Germania flights are directly chartered by G EX, and its the TC clients that are allocated to them for G EX flight days. So if G Ex say they have no plans to change, they are in control, and in a position to say. (One of the reasons, among others, I've prefered their flights)."
"Just how likely are you to contract ebola from someone sitting in the same plane? - or yellow fever, come to that? I am planning to go in November, but would seriously consider cancelling if even one case was reported ....... but then, I wonder .... ?If someone on your flight to (say) Spain had ebola - would they be likely to infect all the passengers on that plane?Edited: 5 years ago "
Hi dancingbarbMy understanding based on extensive research befor I travelled to The Gambia 5 weeks ago- Ebola is NOT airborne - also unless carriers are showing symptoms they are not contagious. Therefore inn the scenario you described basically a person already showing symptoms ( unlikely to be allowed on plane) or one developing symptoms would have to vomit over you or someone else who you later touched and then placed your hands in your mouth or eyes.I travelled via Freetown and had similar concerns hence my research. I am also pleased to announce that 21 days after my return I am completely Ebola free. I took copious amounts of sanitiser with me and limited hand shaking
I have got my doubts about the transmission of ebola.Someone in WHO is describing taxis and motorbike taxis in liberia as a hot source of potential virus transmission.
"Well I've expressed my doubts in the past and others have also too, including some 'experts', so for the benefit of those that have not read past links :prisonplanet.com/cdc-concerned-about-airborn…Also bear in mind that ebola can potentially be passed on by spitting, sneezing, urinating etc. In the past some here have said that Ebola is more difficult to catch than HIV.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Hya Guys, from someone living here in TG, sweat from hands etc can be on bank notes, seats, door handles, etc etc. so yes taxi cabs etc are places where contact can be made from someone who might have it but not know it from someone else. No not airborne, but sweat etc. Senegal shops have sanitisers throughout them and their borders are tightly controlled where as ours are porous and even the min of health main office has no sanitisers. I say come, the lack of tourists will cause far more distress than ebola could er do, as so many people will go very very hungry if tourists don't come. So many down stream of those who don't get employed this season, will then automatically suffer very very badly too, esp as the rainy season has not been good at all this year. we do not live in luxury ourselves so we are mixing with ordinary folk a lot, at the moment."
Why was the rainy season bad?

For those in uk bbc2 9th sept at 9 pm horizon is on Ebola the search for a cure
"Hi traveller ,you worried me then...thought I'd missed it....Its tonight 10 th Sept."
You are quite right!
"3 of us are flying (hopefully) on Jan 21st,im there for 2 months."
"Hello! I live in the Gambia and have done so while working internationally elsewhere. The threat of ebola is, of course, high up among the issues on the minds of the e-patriate community. However, there have been no cases in this country and very active precautions are being taken by the government to ensure that it stays that way. Gambia is a wonderful tourist destination and offers a diverse cultural interest not experienced elsewhere within the range of the approximately 6 hour flight to here.The Gambia economy is very dependent on tourism and a large proportion are from the UK and Holland. Without tourism the country and its very poor people will suffer. I have lived and worked in many countries where the risk to my well-being is massively higher than in peaceful Gambia. Come to Gambia and be very welcome but, as with every other destination, be sure you have the right insurance policy to cover for the unexpected."
"Hi Robert H,Welcome to The Gambian Forums...!!!Your right about the Tourists..!Hope You do some more Post's..''.. Rich..."
"Thanks Rich. Over-reaction to this outbreak is already causing damage to bookings etc. I do not have a tourist based business here but know very well that the poorest here will suffer if tourism fails. I plan to bring my daughters here for Christmas and will do so unless there is a radical change in the situation. Senegal surrounds Gambia and the couple of cases there have been effectively dealt with. Let us hope for an early solution to the suffering of the Guinean, Sierra Leonean and Liberian people. Robert"
Yahoo news reports suspected ebola case in Italian is malaria so good news
Hear hear RobertIt's good to read another positive supporter for TGthey need all the support they can get .I hope to be back Jan/Feb and after watching last nights horizon programme I am encouraged that this will happen. I just hope others will listen to the voice of reason too and help maintain the season for the Gambians.

"Well, I checked that article with interest. The key words are 'could have'... . Let's have some accuracy."
"While checking the latest news on Senegal it appears that there are two other suspected cases, according to Fox News :foxnews.com/health/…"
"With respect, the actual portion of text in the Fox News article, which confirms my post as accurate as there are two suspected cases, Astarsdad:'''''The World Health Organization said on Tuesday there were two other suspected cases of Ebola in Senegal, but no other confirmed ones. The world's worst ever outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever has killed at least 2,296 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. ''''Edited: 5 years ago "
"Actually it does mention 2 suspected cases in the third paragraph. Suspected cases does not mean though that they have it. Anyone who is sick with the symptoms showing are suspected until proven otherwise. The symptoms are similar to those of malaria and they quite rightly are sensibly taking the proper precautions.Someone who travelled here from Guinea was sick in Serrekunda and they isolated them until it was proven they did not have Ebola, it was Malaria. The authorities are taking it very seriously here. At the hospital in Banjul we were nit allowed to visit my father in law as they are limiting visitors so only nominated people were allowed in to take food etc. They are subjected to hygiene precautions. There is also a number to call here if anyone has come from any of the infected countries and is sick. The case I mentioned before, it was a family member that alerted authorities. If any of the clinics/hospitals have suspected cases they can call and an emergency team would come with all the equipment and the masks.gloves etc needed for health staff."
"Sandyrey, I simply reported what is in the article, nothing more and nothing less, but bearing in mind that there is already a confirmed case it does not take a great leap to think that these could be related to the 67 being monitored, as the student was contagious and living with relatives while so for six days or so."
"Liverpool researchers have made a breakthrough that COULD lead to a cure being developed for the ebola virus which is currently sweeping through West Africa.Experts at the University of Liverpool have stumbled across an existing drug – used for severe heart disease – which COULD be adapted to fight the deadly virus.FURTHER TESTING NEEDS TO BE DONE but as the drug is already in use a lot of the work to test whether it is safe for humans has been done, potentially speeding up time it could take to get it to patients in need."
"Well, if correcting a big inaccuracy is rudeness, fair enough. I'm often accused here of scaremongering so I endeavour to be accurate, and that's why I picked up on that, as it works both ways."
senegal latest who.int/mediacentre/…
"thats good news..in effect senegal has no current confirmed ebola cases, the one they had is now clear ..they are currently free from this hidious condition...let it continue.."
"£500.000 in less then 24 hrs for a dogs home,nothing for ebola suffers in 9 months.Makes my blood boil.Before i am critised i am a dog lover."
A major reason why Ebola is spreading so quickly..... contact tracing difficulties due to lack of easily definable addresses:…cnn.com/2014/…Edited: 5 years ago 
"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/britain-t… http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29113530Rockman, britain has sent some assistance and we don t know how much people may have given to MSF and other charities."
"I have to say the news from Senegal is vey positive, though obviously we have some time to go befor Senegal is declared Ebola free. However both Senegal and Nigeria have shown with vigilance and heightened awareness this virus can indeed be contained. Unfortunately for Liberia, guinea and Sierra Leone, they are victims of an unexpected and undiagnosed outbreak which ran unchecked for 14 weeks. Logistics of backtracking contacts and containment is of course almost impossible due to the virulence of the disease and the common practices in cultures which exacerbate the task. But keeping it from other countries does seem to be largely working and I think we should focus on the positives which can be drawn from that for TG"
"Sorry if Im repeating a previous post but the Horizon programme was excellent the other evening. Yes they have more or less found an antivirus for Ebola...and that was given to the British guy who was flown home a couple of weeks ago...But, they only had one course of treatment left...it used the tobacco plant to modify the genes which prevented the virus from spreading within the body. However, it could be a long time before large scale production gets underway to provide the mass immunisation required."
"To answer the original post we Cancelled our family trip, having visited several times before, just would not be able to relax, a lost deposit is a shame, but too many other places to go. Our small financial loss a blow but nothing compared to the impact in TG.Let's hope it does not blight the region for too long and the devastation of loss of life ends."
dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2752911/Ebola…Predicted spread of ebola interestingly Senegal and Gambia not high lighted.....
an interesting article on the situation in Sierra Leone in the two months prior to the outbreak..... washingtonpost.com/world/a-virus-hunter-face…
"We have a holiday booked over Christmas and will be going unless advised not to by the relevant authorities. No cases yet so fingers crossed. On the subject of yellow fever, we have been advised by our GP to have it. Any further views on this?"
"Jeanm l suggest you start anew thread or take a look in the search there is so much on this jab well worth reading. Your question may be lost on hereHave a great trip, ebola may also be in Hawaii as well as Texas now, so where is safe? We're still going can't wait"
"Where is safe ? That is not the only question, one is rather where you are if you are unlucky enough to catch it. Hawaii or Texas will give you a much better chance of survival that contacting it in West Africa. It is also far less likely to spread within a well educated western country with well developed health facilities than a third world location. This is the reality that people will be using when making their decisions of where to travel for winter sun."
"if , and lets hope its not, ebola turn .up in gambia would flights be.stopped straight away or do tc..gb.,etc get you out asap..,i.guess you can.still fly in.and out from.texas but do.we think would happen in.this senario in tg.,"
Gambia Bird has just announced that it is recommencing its flights to Sierra Leon.They used to fly from Gatwick to Freetown then Gambia but the new schedule is via Dakar. I expect this is because Gambia refuses to accept flights from Ebola infected countries. This sensible precaution seems not to apply to the UK or Senegal.Maybe when I travel to Gambia on the 18th Oct I will be safer than in the UK a sobering thought to all the people who have cancelled or that think the UK will ban flights from Ebola infected countries.
"Safer in the Gambia than the UK ? Seriously ? A major worry is what happens if Ebola reaches the Gambia while you are actually on holiday there. Will we be flown home and then subject to some quarantine restrictions ? Or will we be quarantined in Gambia ? Do you think you'd be safer in the Gambia then ? We are still keeping our options open but for the sake of the cost of changing our flights ( £140 ) , we won't be risking catching a disease with a 50% death rate ! Take away the cost of malarone and it's almost cost free changing holiday."
"I also think you may be safer in The Gambia as flights from infected countries to TG have been stopped, whereas to the UK they have not, apart from BA flights. The only check is a temperature check before getting on a flight, which apparently can be beaten by taking Ibuprofen. I expect Ebola in the UK very soon, sadly."
"The reports on the Dallas man are saying he filled in a health form before his flight saying he had not been in contact with anyone with Ebola, knowing he had, surely these formsa re a waste of time, if someone wants tio leave the country they will say whats necessary"

Loganplace .I know Liberia have said that they ll prosecute this man if and when he gets back but I ve read the various reports and they must be a mixture of truth and lies because they all differ on the detail.The poor woman who he helped was pregnant.I listened to an MSF report about pregnant women desperate for medical care being unable to get any ( in relation to their pregnancy )and resorting to going to an MSF centre simply to get medical attention.The Senegalese also put out a statement that if the infected guinean man had not been so ill ....they would have prosecuted him.... I think they just want to get the message across to people ....
"I also feel that although the guy is seriously ill in hospital, and getting treatment, but if he recovers, he should also be prosecuted or deported or some other form of penalty to make it known to others who may be thinking of trying their luck to get into a western country from any infected West African country. But look at the problems this man has created once arrived in the US...how many others he may have been in close contact with?? Mind boggling and selfish!..and can if not contained, spread!! - As For Gambia Bird re-starting their flights from Gatwick to Sierra Leone as states to resume services to help Aid/health workers/business people..why us?...its a German Airline, so why not employ the military to do do this task or do the flights from Germany?..We should be looking after our shores and people in halting this terrible disease, but if GA allows locals to take flight to Gatwick that person could also 'lie' on his paperwork just like the guy in Texas!! - and then we will be at risk. I know aid has to get over there, but surely there are safer ways to transport this without taking risks!!Edited: 5 years ago "
prosecuted.... based on what evidence precisely ?
"Sonia, we are at risk....We ve been at risk since the ""powers that be"" ignored the warnings of MSF.Look at the projections for ebola .... and re flights …plos.org/outbreaks/…"
"Yes I know Jeffbrum, we are at high risk, but no one higher up the line seems to care. I'm worried naturally, and not for just myself but for my family. I know TG is Ebola free and I am supporting the best I can, but if GB stopped flights from Gatwick to affected countries, even after the 'scare' they had on one flight, I would have thought they would have stalled until things improved..just my thoughts x"
"As for the Liberian man who is in a US hospital, I know it is said he was trying to help a pregnant lady and took her to hospital in a wheelbarrow, but isn't that banned and only healthcare workers allowed to do that?..and I feel for the people close to him, family members, medical staff and ambulance crew who are now at risk :( x"
…blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/breaking-gambian-pre…Now the president claims to have a cure.....For ebola.....
"HiYes we have cancelled, visit every year for business and leisure. Government unstable at the best of times - but tourism too important for them to admit cases of Ebola. I for one am not going to risk my family getting it. Life too precious. For small amount we re arranged hol to another destination - small price to pay for life! Dramatic? Maybe. Many European airlines not allowing Gambia air to land, whilst many countries not landing there either. We as a government haven't moved or decided yet! I for one not waiting for them to. Dig deep in the forums and you'll see that it's best not to go right now, shame love Gambia and it's people. Your decision. Good luck."
"I believed Gambia Air was long time barred from European airspace entirely due to airworthiness failure, as are many others. Just to be fair."
"Wow really, your flights have been cancelled? We're going with TC on January 5th and as far as I know our flights haven't been cancelled from Gatwick."
"Just out of curiosity I've rang TC to check on my flight for next march, up to now nothing has changed and the reason for flights being cancelled is due to poor bookings which may in turn be down to the Ebola epidemic, TC also said they will only cancel all flights if the government or whoever tell them too so it all depends on Ebola, as far as I'm concerned I'm still going to Gambia next year. If I don't they will offer me a full refund or a like for like holiday. In my case it will be the cost of my flight."
"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29542129750 British troops going to sierre leone to build treatment centre to treat ebola patients along with helicopters, shame it took so long......"
I haven't cancelled and don't intend to.
I have booked today for February!!!
As long as there is no Ebola I will be there.
In Australia Now..
ft.com/cms/s/0/40681db2-4d5e-11e4-bf60-00144…Financial times a positive spin on the control of ebola and critical of term west Africa in other papers etc....
"Traveller I can't open that link, think you need to be registered?"
Oh neither can I now. I was not registered will try on dek top copy and paste if I can as it was a good article
"HiNeed to get some perspective on this In Africa malaria kills 3000 DAILY contaminated water another 2000 DAILY More deaths in one day than Ebola has killed in 8 months The problem imo isn't just another disease with the potential to kill a lot of people its the way it kills Dying with blood oozing from your eyes ,ears ,nostrils,mouth,genitals and anus whilst your internal organs are dissolving isn't a great way to go hence the huge publicity Every outbreak of Ebola since it was identified has been contained why should this one be different rgds"
"I don t think that if someone entered England ,was whisked off from the airport and still managed to infect 19 people of whom 12 recovered,that it would necessarily be hailed as successful . Also i can see in the news that there is a lot of victim blaming going on,I was interested to read that the american woman with ebola also had malaria …sciencemag.org/africa/…  Also,at bottom of article is a link to a collection of research and news articles for anyone interested."
"Hi Irishadrian,I can t help wondering how many of those dead people in liberia and sierra Leonne may have actually died from malaria or other illnesses particularly as it has been the rainy season."
"The fact is that malaria does not kill up to 90% of victims within a few days, and neither does HIV, so comparisons are disingenuous. If you get Ebola you are likely to be dead very soon after, and it's only right that people should be made aware of this and to make informed choices. TG does not have Ebola yet, and my view is that it may well remain Ebola-free. While it is Ebola-free I will visit, but as others have questioned, can we trust the authorities to be honest if there is Ebola. Nigeria lied about the number of cases in the press during their outbreak, so I am sceptical about what I read and so should others be in my opinion."
"Paul ,My point about victim blaming is that even I assumed that liberian going to Nigeria should have suspected ebola but he said he had malaria. When Nancy Writebol was tested for malaria...they got a positive result ...but she also had ebola ....also she says her colleague thought he had typhoid....but in fact he had ebola.I would be inclined to trust these people....and yet they were not suspecting ebola for themselves....to me this is interesting."
"So you appear to be saying Jeff, that people may be dying in TG from Ebola but putting it down to malaria etc. The only way of really telling whether something like this is going on is by a rise in death rates, as there is no easy way of checking for Ebola virus. I'm assuming there has been no rise of death rates in TG, because surely if there is the medical authorities and even ordinary people would quickly notice."
HiPaulI think comparison of death rates is valid because that's exactly what they are not the number of people contracting a disease but those who actually die whether the death rate is 100% or 1% its the number of dead that's relevant imo A lot more live than die from malaria but its still 3000 approx. per day that die The 4000 approx. that have died from Ebola since the outbreak was announced in March ( there is considerable evidence that it started a lot earlier but went unreported) is statistically insignificant and now the rest of the world has woken up I expect things to be much improved in 4 weeks time we will soon know rgds
"Hi Paul ,I wasn t referring to Gambia but SL and Liberia,particularly Liberia where the suspected and probable cases are so much higher than the confirmed cases......and its not that I m questioning that the numbers may well be far higher than what is recorded but it appears that anyone who has died with a fever condition or relatively quickly, in those countries, is regarded as an ebola victim. I think the problem in any country, as shown by the USA and Spain examples,is initial recognition."
"Hi .there are 4 off us in our party.we have been regular visitors for many years and talking to residents there, they feel there is no threat.as boarders have been closed for some time to the infected country's,no flights in or to the infected country's.but you must go with the advice the government give,at this moment there is no information being given by the foreign office."
