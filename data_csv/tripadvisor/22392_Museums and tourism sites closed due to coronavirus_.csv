Are any museums or archeological sites closed due to coronavirus?
"When are you visiting? If it's today you will be fine. Probably not a problem with regards closures so far but who knows how things might change, see northern Italy as an example.Last year they closed the Acropolis one day in July because it was too hot.The great thing if you visit over the winter is the reduced admission prices to most museums/sites."
