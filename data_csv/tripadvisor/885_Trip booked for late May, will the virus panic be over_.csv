"We have a trip to London/Paris booked for May 23 to June 3. Five full days in London, three full days in Paris.I am not nearly as concerned about getting the nCrv as I am major attractions like the Tower of London/Westminster Abbey/War Rooms and Paris attractions being closed. It would be a wasted trip if everything was shut down.. We have a London flat booked and if we cancel 60 days or more out, we get a full refund on our deposit. They have told me we can apply our deposit to a stay next summer if the flat is available for our dates.Delta is offering free flight changes now but that could change at any time. Part of me thinks this will all have blown over by late May but there’s certainly no way to know. Part of me thinks we should go ahead and change our plans to next summer since we won’t suffer much of a financial hit (changing Eurostar tickets is the only real one I can see thus far) if we do it now.Would appreciate level-headed advice of any kind. I am not panicking, just trying to use common sense and be practical amid changing circumstances."

"The OP clearly states that they are not panicking and I suspect the are well aware of the statistics. That wasn't what they were asking despite the thread title.As to answering their actual question, well I am sorry but that is impossible."
Did you somehow miss all the other threads on this here already?This board is more infected than the whole UK..!
What virus will be panicking the media next summer?
"Who knows what it'll be like next week, let alone in We've more chance of predicting the weather than the course of Covid-19"
"I don't think posters like #1 appreciate the problems that ""the virus panic"" (good description) is causing. I am seeing this short-sightedness everywhere, so let me spell out a few of the problems it is causing.Yes, the chances of you dying as a result of the virus are very low (reportedly only 2% even if you catch it). There are much higher chances of:- being quarantined because you've inadvertently been near a carrier- booked events being cancelled due to transmission risk (concerts at the Guildhall/Barbican have just been cancelled due to a Guildhall teacher catching the virus)- your accommodation/restaurants/attractions/transport closing due to actual or possible virus risk- your own workplace being closed because you visited somewhere later found to be a transmission risk- and the worst - you actually catching the virus and inadvertently transmitting it to others because you have only mild symptoms.So the OP is asking a perfectly reasonable question, even if the answer is 'nobody knows'. It is unrealistic to expect the virus to have disappeared by May. However if there is no significant increase in reported cases, perhaps the public response will be scaled to a more realistic and proportionate level. Who knows."
"I would say - how much of a gambler do you consider yourself? Putting your trip off till next year is less of a gamble, finance-wise. Coming and committing to non-refundable costs is more of a gamble.It all really does come down to that."
">>> As to answering their actual question, well I am sorry but that is impossible. <<<==========Quality."
"COVID-19 is a new pathogen and as such no one has natural immunity to it - if someone with that was found I'd join to queue to interview that person.As such, just about everyone who meets the virus is likely going to have the natural immune-mediated response to it and/or subsequent illness, whether mild symptoms, grave illness or anything in between. Those at higher risk for whatever reason may die because at present all we can provide is supportive care as antivirals are ineffective.Some widespread viral contagious illnesses burn themselves out in a matter of months, but again COVID-19 is an unknown agent. It's not inevitable that everyone is going to meet COVID-19, just as not everyone comes in contact with nasty seasonal influenza species. Reducing the risk of transmission is certainly desirable whether it means avoiding crowds, not shaking hands, or increasing handwashing and using good cough and sneeze hygiene.I think the best that can be said today is that we'll know more about COVID-19 in three months than we do today."
"It's scheduled to come to an end on May 11th, just after the long weekend."
">>>Some widespread viral contagious illnesses burn themselves out in a matter of months, but again COVID-19 is an unknown agent. <<<=======Double uninformed quality!Edited: 5:31 am, March 04, 2020 "
"The panic may be over but the virus might not be according to computer modelling.I get my daily updates from this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zabxwzq_wfAwho is giving unbiased, factual information. I've watched him get more despondent as the weeks pass. Don't know what to suggest. It's very much 'watch this space' (the 'space' being your and my government's official advice.) Trouble is ... if you delay til next year ... who knows what next year will bring?!"
"Well, I don’t think anybody can answer that, but you can also catch Coronavirus in NYC, Sydney, Rome, Paris et al. I have to agree with a previous poster, that it seems North American’s seem more concerned than Europeans. Read the Paris, Rome, Madrid forums, nearly all North American’s cancelling trips."
"No one can tell how this will develop both home and abroad in the weeks to come. One factor to consider is that most travel insurance policies are useless in regards to this virus epidemic. If you do not have cancel for any reason insurance and you have a threshold not to lose funds, only you can make that decision. If you have an opportunity not to forfeit deposits, go with your gut based on your risk tolerance. Many US travelers either take basic travel insurance or believe it or not, none at all. If you prepaid accommodations, venue tickets, tours, etc. that has to have an impact on your decision.......good luck"
"To those of you who actually read my post about being concerned whether or not attractions in London/Paris would be open in late May/June in light of the virus and didn't immediately assume it was about some fear I had about catching the virus, THANK YOU. I very much appreciate the responses, even those of you who said, ""I don't know."" I hesitated about whether or not to even post my question.Tonight I spoke with a friend of mine who is a travel agent. She just booked a trip for herself and her husband to the Netherlands in three weeks. She advised us to not cancel but stay the course unless something drastic develops. That made me feel better about the situation. We did purchase travel insurance when we bought our plane tickets but I don't know if we got the ""cancel for any reason"" kind. And we wouldn't cancel it altogether, it would be moving it to next summer.At this point, we're going to sit tight and wait a bit to see how things play out."
"In the future consider purchasing travel insurance with a company like Travelex and not the airlines. One major portion of a good travel insurance policy is medical coverage and repatriation, especially traveling out of the USA. “Cancel for any reason” policies are specialty policies and very $$$."
"I think you would have known it if you had bought cancel for any reason coverage. Whatever you DID buy, read the policy and make sure you know what it does and doesn't cover. This is always a good idea. Also note that if you bought the policy before Jan 21, the date the virus became a named, known event, whatever you bought should continue to apply. The same may not hold true for policies bought after Jan 21, and if you were to try to buy coverage now you might find limited options."
Also keep in mind some say it could be 18 months before they have a vaccine for this. Until then I can only assume it could keep traveling around the world and popping up here and there. So you might want to keep that in mind if you decide to reschedule.
"Peachy swan I share your pain!I was looking forward to ten lovely days in London at the end of April, but think it’s slipping away. Unlike yourself, I can cancel right up til the last minute but I think I will call it at the end of March. I have my eye on an outback alternative, far from crowds and the craziness that seems to have made rational people take leave of their senses ( what is it with toilet paper???? surely beer is more important).In today’s Times, the lead story is about Boris J.’s plan which will be released in the next twenty four hours. The article quotes ‘scientists’ saying that the infection will peak in six weeks from now then will persist for 2-3 months before subsiding. Boris himself says an outbreak in the Spring is now ‘highly likely’. This coincides precisely with my timing and somewhat with yours. As we have already seen, things have moved fast and somewhat unpredictably ( for eg in Japan, where many tourist activities are closed, same likely to happen in UK?) so don’t know what all this means for relaxed enjoyment of a holiday. Not sure I’m happy to be on public transport etc either at peak infection time. Corporates here are readying for work from home and have already restricted international travel severely.For now I’m keeping an open mind, but there will be a point where the mindset management required to persist with overseas travel at this time, is not worth it. It is meant to be a holiday after all. As for travel insurance, I couldn’t buy any ( after late January) that would cover it, so that’s an issue too. The fun is just going out of it, better to try again next year ( maybe), but will watch and see what happens next few weeks.Enjoy yourself whatever you decide."
"If you are relatively young, suffer from no long-term conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular trouble or asthma, I suggest that do not cancel the trip. The vast majority of people who get it shake it off as they would a bad cold. I am going on a cruise later this month. A month ago I could have cancelled it without penalty because of an itinerary change but without hesitation decided to keep my booking."
"“If you are relatively young, suffer from no long-term conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular trouble or asthma, I suggest that do not cancel the trip. The vast majority of people who get it shake it off as they would a bad cold.”. Mike, I think you’ve missed the point. Many people aren’t overly worried about the virus itself, they are worried about closed attractions, closed restaurants, quarantined hotels - all things that render a “holiday “ pointless. Mike, I hope you have booked a big suite for your cruise. If your ship ends up quarantined like the diamond princess those walls will feel like they are closing in very quickly. To the OP, no one knows. I’m really frustrated as I have 3 trips booked this year. One is in mid May, another mid June. My mum and I have a city break to Lisbon booked and even if flights are cancelled we don’t know if we will get £700 back on non refundable accommodation. At the same time my Dad is booked to be on a sailing holiday in the Greek Islands. He has COPD and is rightly worried about going on a plane at this time. If he cancels of his own accord due to his health concerns, that’s another £700 gone. I have another trip booked for June but right now I’ve only paid £50 deposit. September is a family holiday with all 3 of us. It’s a package so if flights are cancelled we’ll get everything back. Hopefully we’ll be past the peak by then and maybe Dad will feel planes and airports are less risky."
I have a flight booked from April 4th to the 11th. What worries me are museums and other attractions closures. I follow the London forum to check that. Any other source for this kind of info?
The official websites of those attractions?
According to the top doctor in Wales the virus will peak in the UK in May/June.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51720534But then again maybe it won't ?
"Im not booking any expensive travel for the moment. Everything about this is unpredictable from the behaviour of the virus itself to the reaction of everyone globally, whether rational or not. ( Australians are panic buying toilet paper - why?) We may know more in a couple of months or so. Or maybe not."
Basically what you are asking is it wise to to travel to two of the most populous cities in Europe at the beginning of potentially one of the worst pandemics in modern times?
"In the UK people are also panic buying toilet paper. No one seems to know why!Thankfully we already have a large stockpile of essential items because of Brexit, so hopefully we will be OK."
"should be, we'll all be dead by then."
I try to provide factual information and it's deemed inappropriate? Oh well.
""" panic buying toilet paper. No one seems to know why!""because it's cheaper than Kleenex tissues for blowing your nose/catching coughs & sneezes etc?"
"It's impossible to know what the situtation will be in May, at the moment our government feels we're still at the 'containment level and we're all hoping that the warmer weather will help or that a vaccine will be found very soon but there's no way of knowing, all I can suggest is that you continue to monitor the situtation and decide ..... maybe late april/beginning of may if you should travel"
"Panic buying of loo roll has been ""a thing""for decades. I remember reading about it in the 80's when studying Economics at Uni. I find it hard to believe that society will start putting up the ""closed"" signs, but a great many companies who can are taking steps to ensure that most staff will work from home/visit the office only occasionally. Staying in an apartment will at least mean that you aren't affected by reduced staffing at hotels/restaurants.Would I cancel? Probably not, but I would be reading my travel and health insurance policies very very carefully."
“Panic buying loo roll”Maybe people are Sh*tting themselves!
"I'm old enough to remember when a phase of panic-buying sugar (some temporary glitch in international teade, can't remember the details) was followed by panic-buying of salt (which is something we have plenty of domesric supply for)"
"To put you unanswerable question in context, can you tell me when the virus problem will be over in the USA ?"
"@pjw441, I think various extended family members might still working their way through a catering sized tin of baking powder my mother bought during one of those ""panics"" in the 70s. I assumed it was something to do with the three day week, but maybe she was carried away in the excitement of getting a massive chest freezer and her friends ""cash and carry"" card.I rather miss having a local butcher/grocer/baker who would look out for their regulars."
I never thought of that! I just sneeze inside my jumper and make sure it is washed at least once a week.
Nobody knows what going to happen in May. Tbh the hysteria over Coronavirus is just hysteria - even if I got it I won’t self isolate as people get the flu but still come into work. For the simple reason that I would be disclipined for it. My employer even tried to disclipine a terminally ill member of staff for missing too many days off work. The fact the person was dying made no difference.
"Post 39. Well, this is the problem - people coming into work coughing and spluttering and selfishly infecting others . People should not come to work if they have flu or any other infectious illness. How can you say you wont self-isolate? That is so selfish. We hardly know anything about Coronavirus so need to consider others. It takes one person to infect another person for an entire office building to be closed down. If you do so knowingly that's not fair. Your employer sounds a real nasty piece of work."
There are plenty of employers who won't let you take a sick leave if you only have a cold.
"Hello,Sadly this is not a question anyone can possibly answer."
The last major Coronavirus pandemic was SARS in 2003. It died out in late May.
"Ariel is quite right. In any case what’s to stop everyone phoning in to say they’re sick when they’re completely fine? If employers continue to pay their staff they’ll soon go out of business and if they don’t pay how are employees to survive? We all need to use common sense, wash our hands and follow official advice and not seek to panic or to take advantage of the situation."
"The government has already announced that statutory sick pay will be paid from the first day of illness, and reimbursed by them to the employer. I’d expect more announcements of help for employers in the budget tomorrow.While I agree with writing “Don’t Panic” in large friendly letters on our laptops, we are clearly being prepared for an announcement, based on solid medical calculations, in the next week or so that anyone with cold or flu symptoms should stay at home for a week. Any employer with any sense is going to pay people to that rather than risk being outed on social media for refusing.Edited: 1:11 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"No one can answer your question with any reliability.All I would suggest is that, given your timescale, your principal concern should be how things will be in your home country by then."
"IanB, you make a good point on that. Right now, we are concerned that they may start closing schools here in Georgia where we live. The last day of school is currently May 21. Now we are worried they may extend school to make up any time missed if they close schools. If so, we will definitely have to move our trip until next year.Edited: 2:53 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Consider how fast the number of identified cases is rising in the US, the chaotic government and healthcare response, and the fact that whereas most affected countries have tested hundreds of people per million of their citizens, the US total is currently just 5 tests per million Americans.By May, it is quite likely that even China will have restrictions on incoming travellers from the US. Seriously.Edited: 3:58 am, March 11, 2020 "
At this point I think I feel safer in London than I do at home!
