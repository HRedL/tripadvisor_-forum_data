I was wondering how safe is the food supply in Romania since the bird flu epidemic? I read about the deaths in Turkey and was concern. Should I be? I am planing to visit Romania this spring and I would appreciate any comments. 
"no, pierre, don't be wooried cause in romania there are few problems but since now nobody dies....I'm still eating chiken, but other people are changing their ""diet"" ... they're starting to eat anything except bird meat....The situation in Turkey is quite bad and safe God!!!we are not involved till now.I live in Brasov...but here there are no problems at all...We are trying to be optimistic even if the situation could become more serious.Sometimes, I think that other people from all over the world are more wooried than us...it is strange, isn't it?but if you ask, I should say that visiting Romania is Ok..the bird flu epidemic does not affect the beauty of our country.Hope that my comments are useful for you and please feel free to ask me any information you might ned to know ( if the case i'll give my email address..)Regards,O."
"Karikrima, thanks for the replay. As for other people being more worried than you, that is because you live there and have no choice. However, I worry because I have many choices, to go just about any place in this world or to stay home. I do understand that the bird flu affects the birds and not the beautiful country, but for someone who visits the place and like to eat eggs or chicken might be a slight concern. Thanks again for taking the time to write me. "

You don`t need to be worry about bird flu. I live in Romania and I can tell you that is not an epidemy. There was only few isolated cases from birds in travel to other sunny places. The food is strictly controlled and the country stopped all imports from Turkey.What is your destination in spring? Maybe I can tell you more about.
Salut Pierre! Ca va bien? And no ...you dont have to worry...already the Agricultural Minister has been isolating the bird flu cases...few regions still have it.I also ate chicken and eggs hehe I even had one today.Come to Romania there is no threat to your life trust me on this .I think you will like our country a lot because of our very diverse landscapes.Check out also www.romaniatravel.com for further informations!

"I, too, am considering visiting 6/06, and also am concerned about avian (bird) flu. Please keep me posted as to any changes. My grandfather left Bistrita 1905 to emmigrate to America and I would like to know more about his home, thus I plan to visit. Thank you for your help."
Hello EveryoneI am travelling to Romania in August and will have a child (aged 11) with me. I am concerned about Bird Flu but think it is correct to say that as long as you make sure all poultry dishes that you eat are well cooked you will be OK. I shall avoid eating eggs even though I like them. I am touring the country - what should I make sure I see apart from all the guidebook stuff!Caroline
"Do not worry about bird flu; it is a problem only in some regions around Danube river, ususally remote areas, far from main turistic areas. I think all of you could come, it is not such a big problem. Main point of interest: monastires in northern Moldavia (easy to find) and Iasi (capital of Moldavia); Brassov Sighisoara and Cluj area; Bucegi mountains. Unfortunately, Bucharest it is not so tourist friendly (if you do not like street dogs or thieves, not so many but the problem exists there)."
April 22: the last place which was quarantined in Romania because of the bird flu is now open.
