"Ok, we made it here on Sunday gone.Hotel lovely as previous and weather very hot, although beast of a thunder storm yesterday for a few hours.We have befriended a couple of British families at the hotel and they're really nice people. However, two nights ago I suddenly had a really sore throat, proceeded by runny nose. Today matters have gotten slightly worse as the cold seems to be moving to my chest and breathing has become a little tight. Also found out the husband of another Brit couple came down with 'Strep B' two days ago. They had to call doctor out to hotel and he gave the husband a couple of injections and some tablets, costing them a whopping £1,700.I am getting a little worried about my breathing and might end up needing some amoxicillinFor my chest if my breathing gets worse, but I don't want to get stung for such whopping amounts. Any advice here would be very much appreciated ?"
I would go to CVS and speak to the pharmacist or try the pharmacy in Walmart I've had good advice and medicine recommendations from there before. We are here at the moment and my daughter has had a bad cold and cough but is on the mend with medicine from Walmart.Would be worth a try before you spend a fortune.Hope you get better soon. Have a good holiday.
There are nurse practioner or p.a. At either Walgreens or CVS (some stores) who will do a consult and prescribe meds if necessary. This much less expensive than ER visit. Or go to a walk-in clinic. Ask at your hotel where is closest.
I agree with previous poster. Try the Walgreens or CVS clinic where a pharmacist or nurse/PA can prescribe limited medications. Or try an urgent care where you see a doctor just like a regular exam. It should not cost more than a hundred bucks or two. Make sure to ask for generic prescriptions and save all of your receipts to submit to NHS back home.Edited: 6 years ago 
"""save all of your receipts to submit to NHS back home""Never heard of this, could someone explain."
In case you have travel insurance (and I hope you do) you may need to submit receipts to them for reimbursement.
"NHS won't pay for your treatment while you're away so pointless keeping receipts. (Unless the law has changed and I have not noticed) - you WILL however need all receipts for your insurance company if you go via them.You have 3 options. A) - Call your Travel Insurance, and ask them if they can sort you out with a doctors appointment. This will be done quickly. You will need to pay initially I think, but if this IS the case, you will be paid out by the insurance. B) - Go to Walgreens, and go to the healthcare clinic. Again, this will cost but as above, won't cost more than a couple of hundred. https:/…locations_wait-times.jsp - type in your hotel or villa zip code, (will be 5 digits beginning 32xxx) if you don't know this, ask the hotel receiption. C) - phone (via skype) your own doctor surgery back in the UK, and tell the receiptionist the situation. Explain you'd like to speak with a doctor and have the doc call you at your hotel. They can give you a telephone consultation, and if you know your doctor well, and he understands the problem, he can fax through a prescription either to the hotel, or the local pharmacy. I have had to do option C myself once, and it was quick and easy. My doc called my hotel room within 50 minutes of me calling the surgery and faxed through a prescription to the local walgreens who prescribed me the medication. I needed amoxicillin and within 4 days my chest infection cleared up. I can't recall how much it was but it was not THAT bad. Less than $50. Good luck with what ever you choose. Let us know how things go.Edited: 6 years ago "

"My brain is not working properly. When it's 3am in Orlando, it's 8am in UK. US east coast are 5 hours behind UK Time for my bed!!Edited: 6 years ago "
An earlier post asked the same question she went to a CVS just passed SeaWorld wait time 30 mins $79 for consult and $28 for antibiotics so that may be a better option for you Hope your ok Sue
Hope you are feeling better this morning ITM :-)
"I second cvs and Walgreens. My DW developed a bad sinus infection after we landed one year. We went to Walgreens first and the person their said they did not have anything that would suit and referred us to CVS. We met a lovely nurse there and the medicene received worked within 24hrs. There was no charge in Walgreens because they could not help us, I seem to remember including antibiotics the charge in CVS was circ $120.00 of which we got 75% back from our Insurance comany on return home."
I meant your private or travel insurance company not NHS. Sorry for the confusion. I'm a bit under the weather myself and dealing with two sick dogs.
epidemic in orlando ? lol
"Go somewhere with wifi and use the Doctor on demand phone app. In about 10 minutes you'll have seen a dr online and they'll send prescription to a pharmacy close to you. Visit is $40. They'll be able to prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic like Zithromax (azithromycin dosage pack) that should cost about $10-18. They might offer something like a Medrol dose pack for inflammation too that would be about $39. If at any point you have a hard time breathing you need to call 911 immediately so you can go to he hospital. Under US law you cannot be denied medical treatment at an ER due to not having ability to pay, and you cannot be jailed or have criminal charges passed for not paying.Source: I'm a nurse"
