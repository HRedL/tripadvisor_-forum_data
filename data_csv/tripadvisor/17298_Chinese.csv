"@VegasShowgirlYours is the best response I've seen to bad mannered posts. It is one that I'll take great pleasure in stealing with pride for future posts I notice without please or thank you within them.Cheers AdamEdited: 4:32 pm, January 12, 2020 "
"Try the Peking Duck , buffet 5pm till about 11 , perhaps later"
AdamFeel free to copy at will. Mine is probably adapted from something I saw elsewhere on TA anyway. The “google question” is turning into an epidemic here on TA.
"Apologies to all concerned regards my recent requests enquiring about bails and chinese in lanzarote,as you say please and thank you go a long way..."
The cheapest will come with toilet rolls included.
"Dont sweat it Harry, your new to TA, you will find that on the whole we are a friendly bunch, but many thanks for the apology."
"Apologies go a long way too Hackney.Edited: 3:21 am, January 14, 2020 "
Why do you want to know which is cheapest? The most expensive probably only costs 3 or 4 euros more than the cheapest.
"Harry, we like Enjoy Asian and Asia Delicious. I don’t know price wise, where they fall, but they’re lovely meals and service that didn’t cost megga bucks. But if you click on “Restaurants “ at the top of the page you’ll find plenty to choose from."
Sorry buddy...thanks.
@Hackney Harry - you can see 50 or so menus for Puerto Del Carmen on this Instagram site:https://www.instagram.com/pdcmenus/?hl=enIt may help you with working out costs of places to eat and drink :)Jx
Restaurante Miracle charge approx €10 for All You Can Eat.It is not a buffet & you order from a Menu with the food cooked fresh to order!Family run & very welcoming. Food is not only fresh but very good & drinks are reasonably priced also..
Many thanks
Thanks to all for your replies. ..
"Harry, When are you visiting PDC?We are here now & having been slightly disappointed withGo Chow Mein(currently no1 on TA), its worthy of a visit as others are raving about it.For us Sunshine is the best Chinese in Town & they offer a budget friendly Set Course Menu under €10."

"They are ok , not brilliant admittedly, more cheap and cheerful , they even do takeaways , you stuff as much as you can , in a plastic container 4 euros If your sitting in it’s 6.95 , 4.50 for kids"
"should have mentioned that prices may have gone up , due to shutdown ,also drinks are quite expensive , even the water"
