"Hello,I’m going to Maldives in one week and I’m a bit concerned about this virus. I don‘t know is it safe to go or I should cancel my trip?Anyone else here who is traveling soon?"
"There are a number of threads running about this, The Maldives have stopped all direct flights from China, we leave on the 12th and this won't stop us."
We’re due to fly out on the 12th. I have mixed feelings. I see they have their first Coronavirus case.
"Given fairly polarised views, it would be interesting to try and understand the concerns of those who are worried. For example, what are the actual safety concerns...for example, catching flu and being poorly on holiday/when you get home, catching flu and something more serious occurring, getting quarantined somewhere, being denied entry etc?And are people actually considering cancelling their trips and losing their money? Or are they hoping they may be enabled by TAs, resorts, airlines to rearrange at a later date? Or are they expecting to be covered by insurance, etc?To be clear, I am not being inflammatory - I genuinely think that it might be helpful to understand what the concerns are. I don't really understand why these discussions seem to have the potential to become unpleasant!"
Unfortunately we have the first here as well
"I think it's a very scary time for people and that's why this keeps coming up as a thread. I'm not going to Maldives this year -- we're going to Japan which currently has around 20 cases of coronavirus. I'm trying for some perspective and an article on CNN helped. this flu season in the US 10k people have died so far. that's with knowing about how the virus spreads and in theory having an annual jab. i have a compromised immune system and have already had one of the lurgies going round the UK this year. it wasn't fun at all but there was nothing I could do except stay home, rest, take paracetamol and drink a lot of herbal tea. hopefully world health professionals will get a handle on containing this very soon. but really it only sounds deeply dangerous for elderly people and those with poor immunity. no, i'm not trying minimise what's happening, but as i said looking for a bit of perspective."
"Hello, Why do you say it won't stop you? Are you coming from a different location? Changing your flight? I leave on the 13th and fly through Shanghai so I think it stops me. Unless you know something I don't. I'm devastated."
"Well, I’d have thought you’d be physically stopped if there are no flights between China and the Maldives? I’m not certain of the detail of the flight restrictions though?I’m going a week later and not sure why I wouldn’t..."
"China Eastern, my airline, has not cancelled flights but it looks like the Maldivian government has shut down flights from mainland China. https://presidency.gov.mv/Press/Article/23027"
"Yes, that’s my understanding"
"SeadotI think the question was why would someone choose not to go, rather then being prevented from going.In your case i'd be confirming with the Airline if you'll be able to fly and if not is there an alternative route they can put you on.I'm not sure about the laws in Canada, I think in the UK the airline wouldn't be liable under these circumstances. So I'd be taking it up with my insurance and/or credit card provider if I paid by card."
"Oh, I see. It appears that China Eastern is giving refunds to all those who want them so we'll see how that goes. I don't know that there is another route other than through China for that airline, but I will look into it. Thanks for the suggestion."
"NP.If they are giving refunds then you aren't tied to them. If I were in your shoes i'd be investigating alternative flights that aren't going via China. If you can get them at similar price I'd take the refund and switch. If its going to be a lot more I'd investigate your insurance cover. Another route might be your card provider, I know some cards in the US provide protection if the provider fails to deliver, not sure if the same is true in Canada.But keep in mind time is of the essence. If you definitely want to go, rather then get a refund, i'd be chasing options now. Every day that passes you'll have more and more people competing with you. At some point, even if your airline/insurer/card provider were prepared to pay for alternative flights, there may not be any available.Best of luck, I hope you have your feet in the sand in a couple of weeks."
"Seadot, I believe your first question was asking 66BJF. ‘ There are a number of threads running about this, The Maldives have stopped all direct flights from China, we leave on the 12th and this won't stop us.’1) I think you are confused Reading in between lines, no they are not flying from China but United Kingdom.2) what he/ she means was that ‘ I felt safer and less worried now that Maldives have stopped all direct flights from China.’— frankly I thought most people who are not travelling from China will actually feel the same as him/ her.Btw I am sorry that your flight is cancelled and you must be very frustrated. However I don’t think you can find another airline from Shang Hai to Maldives that easy, now that Singapore airlines would not carry passengers who have been to China in the last 14 days before they transit / arrive in SIN. You might have the choice of changing your flight to Cathay Pacific. I don’t know where are you atm, but Canada - HKG - MLE can be a choice. If you are in shang hai atm I am not sure emirates and ethihad’s recent policy in regard of Chinese transit in Middle East, maybe you can have a look.Neither do I know if transit in Sri Lanka will be still another choice for you. However given the current situation if you actually have stayed in shang hai for a while it’s best to check if your hotel is one of the very few which provided a rebooking. I understand how frustrated you feel.Edited: 4:46 pm, January 31, 2020 "
"Thank you all for your very kind and thoughtful responses. I will try my best to arrange for another option or get a refund and try a different part of the world. I appreciate all of your advice.It's just sad to miss out on a trip that I was so looking forward to.Edited: 10:21 pm, January 31, 2020 "
"Seadot, can you not get different flights to the Maldives?Edited: 4:58 am, February 01, 2020 "
"As far as I know Emirates and Etihad have not stopped flying to China, however lots of flights from UAE to Male, can you get onto one of those if your flight isn't flying? Good luck. We are flying from UK via Abu Dhabi and are not anticipating any problems (though packing hand gel etc in hand luggage...)"
"Unfortunately, the cost of those flights is outside our budget. The original flight we bought 4 months ago was very cheap and the price and the long lay over times that I'm finding make the trip un-doable. We'll try to go again next year. Good luck with all of your trips. I hope you have a great time. Sigh..."
"Oh dear. How about cancel if you can get your money back, then hold fire and see what offers come up over the next few weeks?"
"Hello, We r also going on the 12th & also very concerned as we will be taking our 2 little ones! R u still planning to go? I’m unsure of what to do now to be honest x"

"Pyes, FWIW I recognise you are in a tricky spot travelling with a child with asthma. For me personally, I’d see the other risks as an unlikely possibility, and as such as part of life’s rich tapestry that wouldn’t deter me, even with my family in tow (recognising that others may see things differently and that there are no rights and wrongs here).But I’d be seriously thinking this through if I was taking an asthmatic child (or anyone with a compromised immune system etc), especially to a more distant resort (where are you going?).I’m pretty sure I know what I’d conclude, but it’s much easier when it’s theoretical! That said, we took our family not long after one of the kids had been blue lighted into hospital and spent an anxious week in ICU, and in the knowledge that should she have a repeat episode on a remote island in the Maldives, the outcome may have been very different. The GP was happy to conduct a very thorough check up and tests a day or two before we left. And my daughter was in her teens and old enough to discuss the decision. I really don’t envy your decision making."
"Replying is my pleasure. I find that sometimes just talking it through helps me. My daughter has ongoing health issues but is sensible (kind of...sometimes) and old enough to make her own decisions. She has recently taken herself off around Vietnam and Borneo, not to mention my receiving a text, while changing planes in Doha so completely helpless, to say she and some friends had hitched halfway across Croatia but it had gone and got dark and now they had to try and get back to the Airbnb! Every risk makes me hold my breath...and every safely resolved adventure makes me glad she’s living a full and exciting life. When they were children I threw them on ponies and skis etc, and sometimes we ended up in A and E, but overall we had fun...maybe we are risk takers! But I’d still be weighing up the pros and cons in your shoes. Could you postpone if you decide not to travel? Or change to an island with a speedboat transfer in case of a night time emergency if you decide to travel?"

"I’m afraid I don’t know the answer to any of those questions, but they are all good questions, albeit still unlikely IMO (but clearly not impossible).The only one I can judge is I don’t anticipate minding being quarantined on my resort island, except I’d lose a lot of income as a contractor. I’m taking my laptop just in case - so I could do some work at least.But this is easy for me to say as we’ll be travelling as a couple, and the kids are all at uni or work, so nobody will be missing us except dogs, horses and clients! Personally, I wouldn’t even be concerned with children along - if they were healthy."
"Unfortunately, the decision was made for us but I don’t envy your situation of having to choose either. I say, if you can get your money back, do it. Sure, it’s highly unlikely you’ll get sick but at this point, the potential quarantines and flight stoppages might become a logistical nightmare. I feel like it’s going to get worse In the next few weeks before it gets better. Good luck, either way!"
I am heading to Raa Atoll next week too. So far I think everything is fine to go. Fingers crossed!!
Anyone out there now who has any comment to make?
"I am here now, arrived on Sunday. From the perspective of a guest there is no sign of any issue really. Arrival was simple with a temperature ‘gun’ pointed at us to screen for fever. Airport staff wore masks but almost nobody else.The main issue in the resort is that it is half empty with no travellers coming from or through China. For me the bigger concern is exposure during the journey, not here. Outside of China that still seems to be low at the moment.Edited: 10:09 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"Yes, it isn’t just direct flights that are barred, any passengers who originated in, or have transited through China are barred entry to the Maldives. I’m with the last post, I’m not worried, but if o were, it would be about the flight - I’m always worried about the lurgies on the flight..."
"Hi We are booked to go in March from UK via Dubai, I am not too concerned about catching the virus, I am more concerned about being quarantined if exposed to it.As you mentioned, there are always “germs” lurking on long haul flights, are masks beneficial on flights or would they be more alarmingAny comments appreciated"
"Hello,Maldives is safe still if you are travelling with few days it won't be issue but i will recommend to not use any route belong to china or flight from china"
"Jiiimse, I believe the professional consensus on masks is that when used/tested under hospital conditions they are helpful but when used/tested out of hospitals their positive effect lasts for just a few minutes. But that they DO have an alternative advantage in as much as when wearing a mask you can’t/don’t touch your face and this this is advantageous in terms of reducing transmission of a variety of nasties. So you could just ensure you do not touch your face, particularly mouth, nose, eyes at all without washing/sanitising your hands thoroughly first. I am not, BTW, a health care professional.Edited: 4:04 pm, February 05, 2020 "
We are off next week UK via Dubai and certainly not considering cancelling. Everything I've read has suggested masks are almost totally ineffective but lots seem to be relying on them. What I have found in my pre-planning is that both the main UK high street chemists - Boots and Superdrug - are completely out of antiseptic/anti-bacterial wipes (including online) so people must be panic buying.
"@PrudieDorset, we bought antibacterial household wipes at Tesco before we left home and,I always have a stock ofmhand sanitizer in my travel kit.. We arrived last Friday, 31st January. We are staying at Amari Havodda and at the two restaurant entrances they have placed bacterial hand sanitizers and notices requesting guests to use it on entry and exit. However people being people, you may or may not be surprised at how many walk straight past without using it. I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that they have either their own or have washed their hands before leaving their villa.  What really got to me yesterday was one couple where the lady used the sanitizer, her husband stood behind her then walked past it rubbing his hands together as if he had also used it! We have seen lots of couples where the female has used sanitizer but the man has not. Presumably the same guys who do not wash their hands after going to the toilet according to my husband. It must be contrary to their manliness but unfortunately the virus is not so discriminatory.Edited: 2:10 am, February 06, 2020 "
"I am reading this forum with interest as we are due to fly out from Australia on 22nd Feb to the Maldives. We are transiting in Singapore on the way over for one night and that is the bit that has me most concerned.I am very healthy but my husband has an autoimmune condition that makes him a bit vulnerable to bugs. We have travel insurance but from what i have heard, most travel insurance companies do not cover the outbreak of a virus or pandemic - apparently it’s in the fine print.I’m not sure what to do at this point. If we could fly direct I would not be worried at all. It’s just the stopover that has me concerned."
"Jane, just to say that while I am not worried myself about the new coronavirus, if I or a family member had a comorbidity that was likely to make catching coronavirus a riskier proposition, I'd be following the news, healthcare and governmental advice very closely in the lead up to my trip."
"Jane, also I'd check your own travel insurance. People say a lot of things, especially on the Internet...and a lot of them aren't true, or may be true for them but not the experience of others. I have just gone over my own annual travel insurance plan and can find no small print excluding pandemics, epidemics etc. It refers to them, but not as exclusions."
"Flew in 01/02 with BA, got the temperature gun, nothing else. Flew out to India 03/02, was asked to self certify in India as fit and not exhibiting flu symptoms. Nothing else. Obviously there are plenty of Chinese enjoying the Maldives, there were no other measures in the resort or airport. Flights from China seemed to be drying-up but only my anecdotal evidence. I wouldn't worry about the location itself."
"We are going in two weeks; leaving on 21st February. I am little worried about our trip as well, specially because we are transiting through london."
"Dhara P, is there a reason you are particularly worried about traveling through London?"
"Some people’s comments on here amaze me, I work in London and commute everyday, let’s all not go into London and have the next few weeks off."
Thanks for the response. Just was worried because of new that I see. But your comment does help me feel safer and clears the wrong information I have.
"I wouldn’t worry about london any more than anywhere else (not sure what news you’ve seen that has made you concerned?). I also work there, and am flying out of there to the Maldives. It’s business as usual at the moment..."
"We're still alive and well in London, the wind didn't blow us all into the sea :DDhara P you'll be fine, just brace yourself if you go to a pub, the bill may give you a coronary :/"
Never thought of that! Maybe stick to the Gin bar in Qantas lounge - enough gin and no virus will get you!
"I am due to fly to India from the US this week and then to the Maldives through Sri Lanka (short layover) late February - I am not cancelling my trip. Just practice good hygiene and build up your immune system ahead of time. Even though the risk of transmission with the itinerary is low, it is also good to observe good hygiene to avoid getting any type of illness on a vacation!Good luck! Hope you enjoy it!"
"Hi any updates on this please? We fly from Manchester on 5 March to Ellaidoo with Qatar. I'm thinking either it will go bad in the next week and no one will be going any where or it will be business as usual. I plan to take wipes for the plane tray and arm rest and a few things when we get there - door handles, phone TV remote - just being a bit OTT. I'm thinking if everyone is being careful and airlines, airport and hotels are we may be safer than normal. But just don't know what to believe."
Hi guys do you have any updates on the Maldives? We are due to travel in the 5th of April. My husband has suffered very badly from chest infections the last few years and we also travel with a 6 year old. Am so confused as to whether we should travel or not.
"I think it is too early to call what the situation will be early April TBH.Certainly at the resort I am in, they are being very careful, there is hand sanitiser all over the place and most surfaces have a little notice on them advising that they are sanitised hourly."
"I suspect the biggest risk for most of us is from the unexpected events as countries start to get nervous.Just been reading about the following on the Mauritius forum:https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/coronaviru…Mauritius threatening to turn back an Alitalia flight of ~300 people, giving them a choice between going home or quarantine. Eventually the let most passengers in, aside from the ""quarantined"" regions in Italy. Varying reports suggest 30-70 people went back to Italy :(Edited: 8:05 am, February 24, 2020 "
"Although one of the regulars has said the authorities are now denying the reports, so who knows."
I have been following covid 19 since it started. the situation in wuhan is bad， there seems to have withheld of vital information. I am in beijing where seems quite ok so far since everyone is scared and wear masks the public places are empty. its not a involuntary lock down. you can go freely. so 400 out of 30 million seems to be a good number . the rules are very well enforced， you go supermarket you register your ID and your temperature gets taken， even you buy a take away you register your ID ， I am not sure if the beijing number is correct but as far as I can see， there is no outbreak in beijing at all， it makes sense everyone is tracked and watched by everyone. for instance someone make a cough during heavy smoke cooking， the police show up the next hour with full protection suites. because your neighbor reports you. the situation in wuhan is a different story due to no precautions. I watched the footages， it could make sense.so if you compare the situations in wuhan and the rest of China， it seems that the only way to slow this ， I am not even saying stop this is to implement army like rules which foregone yours rights. if not ， you will be seeing the korea， italy a lot more. a patient can be asymptomatic for up to 37days and he infects.its really not a good times to travel at this point . the risk is not maldives. its the plane. the thing can infect prison， elder home， cruise ship big time.
Thanks everyone. I'm still monitoring the situation and have 5 weeks to decide what to do. Is anyone planning to travel to Maldives in March?
"Yes, I'm leaving next week. Unless the FCO advice changes (which it would need to do for my insurance to pay out) I'll definitely be going."
"We travel next week.I'm taking additional precautions in respect of interactions with large groups of people. We have extra hand sanitiser gel to keep in our pockets, wipes for any surfaces like the tray table etc. And we have some of that horrid stuff you squirt up your nose to help prevent colds etc, although I honestly have no idea if it will even have any effect - but it makes us feel better about all the people we'll come into contact with whilst travelling.We've taken the view that, at the moment at least, the UK is a low risk country with very few cases reported, and as yet I believe there are none in the Maldives.We're both fit and healthy, so not in a high risk category should we be infected. Whilst this seems to be an extremely virulent virus, it's not been anywhere near as deadly as SARS for example. However as @Captain says above, I'm sure there is information that's not been released...Until the Foreign Office warns against all recreational travel, there's not a great deal you can do. Assuming you've paid for your holiday, if you cancel now you will lose all the money you've paid."
We are due to fly next Thursday via Doha. A bit feed up although in the scheme of things a cancelled holiday is trivial but was due to fly the day TC went bust so this is getting a habit.
We are flying out of Dubai tonight and the Emirates flight is packed. People are still travelling. Good to know we are not the only ones! :)
"Travelling SaturdayFlying Gulf, checked on line and plenty of seats avaiable, we are BC and that shows 8 available on our flight. Not overly concerned, we have hand sanitiser,Just will follow advice as in use tissues, sanitise after loo etc"
We are flying next Friday 6 March - BA/Qatar via Doha. Like ppply we will have hand gel and anti bac wipes and wash our hands a lot otherwise we just plan to enjoy our holiday! We are also both fit and healthy and not too old!!!
"Yes taking pack of detol wipes to do armrests, tray etc, hand jell. Either the world will be shut by next week or it may be the safest flight we have ever been on because every one will be cleaning everything.Male was bad last week but hoping maybe they've got a bit better? our flight lands 9am so maybe not too bigger back log. Keep posting it help to know others are going."
In what way was Male 'bad' if you don't mind my asking?Do you mean delays at immigration?
Yes there was a post saying three or four flights waiting a couple of hours or more - may have been an Ellaidoo review.But they may have got more efficiant or it may depend on time of day
"Hmm, that's not great...Still, we also land at 9am, and are travelling BC, so hopefully should be let off the plane first."
"We got in on a morning flight last week (BA - is that 9.40? I can’t remember- it was a whole 6 days ago!) and the immigration hall was already full, with the queue out of the door. It took a little under two hours from landing to baggage carousel, with more and more people from subsequent flights cramming in. And lots of people clearly feeling nervous about people of a different ethnicity to themselves joining the melee. In all honesty, I’d say that if you are going to be exposed, the arrival hall your highest risk point."
"Yikes! Poor you, not a great start to your trip :(Just out of interest, were they picking the domestic transfer people out of the queue if they were likely to miss their onward flight, or do you think its just a case of taking your chances? I've notices that Male airport is usually really good at fast tracking people stuck in queues and in danger of missing flights for international departures - I guess it is wishful thinking to hope for the same for arrivals?"
"No, you took your chances, I’m afraid. They picked the odd family with particularly fed up looking children out to fast track ...but those with patient, well behaved kids weren’t so lucky! I think I’d say it’s worth making sure you have a bottle of water in your bag. I think later arriving flights are probably not so bad.We waited over an hour late last year so were ready for it, knowing that checks might be slower.Edited: 12:38 pm, February 27, 2020 "
Thank you so much for taking time out of your holiday to give us info which while not always good at least prepares us.Have a fantastic holiday and we'll all keep hoping we join you.
Thanks for the updates. Please keep them coming as it will inform the rest of future travellers about what to do :) :)
I am also very confused if I should book a trip to Maldives in March as thats when our little one gets summer holidays. The most terriying thing about corona virus is that the infected person with no symptoms can spread the virus to so many people without knowing he is sick and you don't know the person next to you is infected or not. Airport authorities can't even tell if someone have virus without symptoms like fever etc.
"Sunny, I know its a worry, but small children seem to be particularly resistant to Covid-19, with infection and death rates particularly low for that age group (as opposed to SARS which I believe was quite dangerous for children) That said, while I'm cheerfully setting off on my pre-booked trip (and definitely taking LindyLouisa's advice!), I'm not sure I would actually book a trip in the current circumstances."
"...and yes, thank you very much MalDiva for your updates, much appreciated."
LindyLouisaRushed straight through to where though?
More likely the naughty room to reflect on your bad behaviour :)
"Sunny, I have booked a trip and will leave next weekend. Unless there is official advice to not go (which means it will be refunded by my insurance) I will just cross my fingers and hope everything will be fine.But honestly, I would personally not book a trip in the upcoming month at the momemt.."
we are due to fly out in may.. and have a decision to pay the outstanding balance over the next few days.. we thought we would ring the travel insurance about cover incase flight is cancelled etc.. they basically told us that since the coronavirus has broken out (jan 23rd i think) all holidays will not be covered from this date for if anything was to happen related to coronavirus.. we booked our holiday (just the deposit) for maldives on the 25th jan for may time.. so should we pay the remaining balance and hope the holiday still will go ahead and travel at our own risk.. or simply cancel holiday and lose a low deposit. we are flying heathrow to doha with qatar and then onto male.. please help..
"Nick, did you buy your travel insurance after the 23rd?You may want to check the docs you received from your travel insurance and also get some advice from Citizens Advice."
"we can get travel insurance but they do not cover war/terrorist activity, natural disaster or nuclear disaster,, epidemic/pandemic illness.. they said its go at your own risk.. we are in a better position than people booking later on in the year as will have spread more and probability will be higher of cancellation..but do we really want to pay a substantial amount of money that is 9weeks away and is unknown whether the holiday will go ahead,or cancel the holiday and book a very last minute holiday to the same place that has more chance of going ahead as only has a few days of unknown??we have been advised to cancel and lose a low deposit. and wait until nearer the time and go ahead."
"Ah ok, I misunderstood, I thought you'd been told that by your existing travel insurance. Yes most new policies will exclude COVID-19. Some may still cover you, but at a premium, you'll have to phone around and ask."
"As an example my policy covers me for all those events (Barclays Travel Plus Pack). But I'm not sure if they'd cover you if starting the policy now. And you need to be a Barclays Premier customer to get that policy (unless it's changed recently).So worth phoning around to see if any will cover you.And for the future, if you're travelling to places like the Maldives, always best to get the most comprehensive and reliable insurance you can before you book."
Just come back from the Maldives on 15th Feb return and no issues at all.
"Agree with Frusci, the Maldives is actually fairly hazardous - on a resort island you are very far from a 'proper' hospital and there is no British Embassy so its really worth taking out as comprehensive a travel policy as you can afford. Had your only issue been the date you took out your policy, you probably would have been ok - the crucial date would have been the date *you knew* that Covid-19 would become a pandemic, not the date *it broke out*. The WHO only confirmed human-human transmission on Jan 21st (I checked yesterday), so you could definitely have argued that on Jan 23rd, you *didn't know* about it. Today, you'd be on a lot shakier ground. Unfortunately, as your policy has a specific exclusion for pandemics/epidemics, I think this will be the point upon which any claim would fail. I predict a lot of litigation in relation to travel insurance claims on this subject. *The date you knew* is such a subjective and woolly term, and to be fair it is only in the last 48 hrs or so that the situation has become quite as dire as it is. Personally, I'm planning to follow the FCO advice. I've just ordered face masks and hand gel on amazon though :("
"Hello all, Anyone knows what would happen if your thermal reading shows a higher body temperature than normally allowed? We are flying to Male mid March via AbuDhabi (from UK). Many thanksEdited: 5:25 am, February 28, 2020 "
"If you knew that you already had a temperature, do you think it would be a good idea to travel?Even if it just a cold, you could cause a lot of disruption to a lot of people. In that eventuality, it might be a better idea to seek medical assistance in the UK and then claim on your travel insurance to rebook your trip at a later date when your temperature is normal."
thank you for your time in replying..should we really be cancelling our holiday to maldives in may.. or are we over reacting..
"The question about scanning as having a raised temperature - you’d be pulled out and and talked to. I suspect you may be denied entry. It’s fascinating to watch the cameras scanning everyone.As far as I am concerned, flying while poorly is irresponsible, even when there is no covid 19 - I don’t want to sit on a plane full of someone’s norovirus or flu germs! At this time, it’s very naughty indeed - I can’t actually imagine anyone would?"
"I don't think any travel insurance would reimburse you for choosing not to travel because you had a cold/temperature. Unless you were refused boarding by the airline or turned back by customs/etc. Otherwise it would be classed as elective abandonment. Don't know of any that will cover that and if they do I imagine the premium would be punitive.I do have some concerns in relation to this, as I usually pickup the sniffles during a long haul flight. And our 1 y/o is teething, so often has a temperature. Hoping it all calms down by the time we fly."
"Nick, personally I can’t see any reason to cancel for may. I’m certainly not cancelling for June unless the situation at the time necessitates it. That said, what do any of us know...to my knowledge there are no public health officials specialising in covid 19 on the forum. Those that I know are going about their business as usual..."
"Frusci, I think if you had a temperature and were due to fly in the current climate, you’d probably find a way to be reimbursed either by the airline, holiday company or insurers. ‘I tried to cancel my trip because I was ill and worried I could spread covid 19 to a currently unaffected country but my insurers/airline/TA said tough - just keep quiet about it and board that plane’ is a Daily Mail headline no company wants!"
"Frusci, it depends on the policy. Mine (which I have read about a million times now) confirms that I am covered if a doctor advises against travel for any reason.In the current circumstances, my GP would definitely provide this confirmation if I had a temperature, even though in the normal run of things he probably wouldn't."
"MalDiva, I'm not so sure. They tend to be sticklers when it comes to elective abandonment as they are worried about Moral Hazard (people that can't go for another reason which is excluded from their policy saying they have a cold).I suspect unless someone of authority (airline, customs, doctor, FCO) prevented you from travelling or advised against it, you'd be eating the cost :("
"hello, I am due to fly on the 9th of March from Heathrow via Oman. my boyfriend has a heart condition which I have declared on the travel insurance. we booked the holiday in August last year also booked the insurance on the same day. I have contacted my insurance provider but at the moment they are having a very high number of emails/calls. Don't really know what I am asking but any advice on if we should cancel or not would be very appreciated . thank you to everyone who has shared their thoughts so far."
"Nick, I don't envy you your situation, such a difficult call to make. Personally, I have made the decision to travel because: a) I am already fully financially committed and...b) I know I am covered for any losses if I get stranded.Neither of these are true for you, so in your situation, I wouldn't be committing myself any further. There is even a part of me that is hoping the FCO does change their travel advice in the coming days so I have an 'out' as I would prefer not to be traveling at this time.You don't have to answer this, but how much have you already paid? Is it a sum you are 'happy' to lose?"
"Miriam LouetteMine is the same. But thats a general clause that most policy's have (provided you have medical cancelation cover). Bit hard for them to say we wont pay out despite medical advice to the contrary :DI'm not sure my doctor would advise against travel if I just had a cold. I suspect she might. But she would be honest about the reason. And I think the insurance may well challenge that.I went through this when my youngest got Chicken Pox a few weeks before we were going to the Maldives. I advised the insurance and they wanted to see the Doctors advice as soon as we received it. Fortunately it ran its course before we were due to travel. And our Doctor was happy to issue a Fit for Travel letter. But had she not, I got the distinct impression my insurance company would have looked into it (as normally it should have run its course by that point). And possibly challenged it if my Doctors advice wasn't based on sound grounds.I guess in the current climate, they may be more amenable. As if they refused to cover and you got turned back, they'd have to foot that cost :/"

"Missplant, I'm sorry to hear of your situation...I think concerns around catching it differ from concerns around already having it if that makes sense?As the Maldives is currently free from Covid-19, your insurer might well argue that he would be safer there than here, where there are already outbreaks.What does your policy document say about cancellation for health reasons?"
"I don't think ATOL covers this eventuality - last time I looked (admittedly a while ago), it only covers losses arising from situations in which operators go bust. Also, any insurance policy taken out now wouldn't cover Covid-19, as it is already known about."

"Missed your other post Frusci, sorry about your LO with Chicken Pox :(I tend to agree that in the normal run of things, a cold./temperature would;t cut it, but as the NHS is going have to deal with the fall out, they have a huge incentive to mitigate the spread. i think the bar would have been lowered quite significantly as to what constitutes 'illness' Also, nobody wants to be THAT insurer who refused to pay out resulting in sick people being forced to travel -imagine the headlines/share price impact"
"Miriam LouetteYou're right, just double checked.I dont rely on Atol protection, so never really considered it in detail."
"Sorry to be a pedant, but I've just checked again, and ATOL really doesn't cover disinclination to travel, only operators going under. I can't link, but if you google 'ATOL Disinclination to travel' the first hit is a Telegraph link that covers this point."
x post :)
"Frusci, I suspect you’d only have to ring the airline as things stand and say you had a cold and temperature, and were worried about both covid 19 and being denied entry, and that the airline would say, please don’t even come to the airport. Likewise a doctor."
"I was thinking it would cover if FCO advised against travel, not disinclination to travel. But I was wrong about that, just double checked. So have removed those posts incase they mislead.As I said I dont rely on Atol, so never looked at what it covers in depth. Prefer to rely on comprehensive insurance and my Credit Card."
"MalDiva, youre probably right. I hope none of us have to find out though :)I'm more worried about the sniffles I always have when I get off a long haul flight :/"
"Miriam Louettethank you for your reply, Yes I agree at present it will be safer to be in the Maldives than in the UK. so it really would be a shame not to go as this is our first time to paradise. I will have a look at my policy and I have also emailed my provider and I will share my information if that helps anyone else.thank you"
"Me too, I get terrible hay fever/allergies which look very much like a cold. Very much hoping to avoid a sneezing fit in the immigration queue :("
"Miriam/Frusci, I don’t think anyone dare even clear their throat in public!"
Well there's a good chance i'm screwed if we get to that level of panic. Because I always look sick as a dog when I come off a long haul flight (even Business Class).
"So, I've actually just read the Telegraph article I mentioned above, and the last section reads as follows:(copy and pasted from the article, dated today) ""What if a pandemic is declared?If the World Health Organisation (WHO) declares a pandemic, this will not affect your travel insurance. The ABI confirmed to Telegraph Travel that there were no pandemic clauses used by any of its members. “FCO advice or other restrictions outside of individuals’ control will be the trigger for cancellations,” a spokesperson said""This is interesting, as several posters have said that their policies do include a pandemic exclusion clause..Hmmm"
"Hmm, out of curiosity just had a quick look at NatWest Platinum, which 120Hill mentioned doesn't cover Pandemic or if FCO declares its not safe to travel:https:/…20Policy.pdfIt defines Epidemic/Pandemic as natural disaster:""Natural disaster – fire, storm, lightning, avalanche, explosion, hurricane, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, medical epidemic or pandemic.""And this appears to be covered:""Section A Cancelling Your Trip (before you are due to start your trip)What is coveredWe will cover you for your:You are unable to use your pre-booked and pre-paid accommodation because the accommodation or immediately surrounding area is adversely affected by natural disaster."""
"They have an ""an anticipated event;"" exclusion. But that would be a difficult argument to have, if the FCO and airlines/etc were all still flying to your destination. And there was no advice not to travel.Although if booking now I'd make sure I gave my insurance a call to make sure they'd cover cancelation."
"Frusci, that’s the same as my bank’s travel insurance."
In case anyone would find this useful. Had a web chat with my insurer. Below was their reply to: 1. If FCO advise against travel:Kindly not your policy does not have any provisions regarding advice by the FCO against travel. In the event this is to happen you may wish to contact our claims department as they are everything on a case by case basis.2. If denied entry to the destination:Kindly note you may have cover under the curtailment section if you were denied entry once you reach the destination - subject to terms and conditions - however you would need prior authorisation from out medical team. In the event this is to occur would need to contact them for assistance.
"My Policy with Staysure covers FCO/WHO directives that affect travel to/from countries but it was an add on (Travel Disruption Extension) which luckily I took.We fly a week today and as we are both fit and healthy we will go and enjoy ourselves unless the Maldives ban entry from UK or Qatar, where we fly via, or the UK stop travel. Both of which I hope are unlikely."
"The Nat West policy linked to above explicitly states that it covers policyholders in the event the the FCO advice restricts travel...• The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advising against “All Travel” or “All but essential travel”to your intended destination, providing the advice came into force after you opened yourPlatinum account or booked your trip (whichever was the later) and was in the 28 days beforeyour departure on your tripLooks like you're in the clear 120Hill!"
I’ve just had another read and looks like I am covered thank you Frusci. The only way I’m not going is if FCO advise not to or Emirates stop flying there. Just getting jittery I guess. It’s a holiday of a lifetime and more expensive than any other holiday I’ve ever had.
"Good news, 120Hill, hopefully your mind is a bit more at rest now?Amusingly, in the course of picking over the exclusions of my policy, I've discovered that I am I am not covered in the event that I 'do not enjoy my trip'I have to laugh, what on earth happened for them to actually include that clause???"
"I am due to travel 5 March with Virgin flights with Qatar, I am hoping if FOC advice is don't go Virgin will cancel or look after us. Am I being too hopeful?OH has travel disruption but I haven't. Just renewed (for after this trip) and I've added everything."
"120HillNP, glad its some good news for you."
"Miriam LouetteLOL, they either get a lot of attempted claims, or actually lost a big one when someone didn't ""enjoy their trip"". Either way i'd love to find out.And of course, now you know you'd better have a good time :D"
Miriam Louette i have explained the situation with the travel agent.. the deposit was 300 which is no loss considering the cost of the whole holiday.. but they have let us cancel the holiday and gave us the 300 deposit as credit with them. im still gutted ive had to cancel the holiday.. but least i can keep an eye out closer to the time i want to go in may and re book. it may either be cheaper.. but i do believe as time goes on through the year holidays will be harder/less convincing to book.
"Ours is a little more interesting of a situation because we have our flights booked on award travel, and they're one-way on different airlines.We're currently still planning on going, but trying to be prepared for ""what if"" scenarios.On 4/15/20 we fly on Etihad from JFK to AUH to MLE.But on 4/28/20 we return MLE to CMB to ICN via Korean Air and then 5/1/20 ICN to ORD also on Korean Air.The concern is ""what if"" (after we travel/begin the vacation) Korean Air cancels flights or we're not allowed entry to/from Seoul.Unfortunately all routing on KE are via Seoul. What remains to be seen is if KE would accommodate on Delta via Award tickets since they're policy is you have to have round trip airfare booked if you're using Award travel on a partner.Our Travel Insurance appears to cover us in the event of a cancellation, but only to the point of reimbursing the expenses (and since we only paid like $350 in taxes on the award tickets .....) or trip delay (ie, hotel, etc. if we're stuck).So at this point, we're just crossing fingers and will see/hope/pray for the best.Granted, a LOT can happen/change in 7-9 weeks.I'm sending positives vibes/thoughts/prayers to everyone else that things work out smoothly for all (including those folks in quarantined cities/areas)."
"With regards to insurance policies, the way I understand mine is if FOC advise not to travel and the holiday is cancelled, then you will be covered, but should you choose to ignore this advice and travel regardless and something happens to you, then you wont be covered."
"I don't think this is true in all cases; if the FCO advises against travel to a particular country for an excluded reason (eg. war/riot/terrorism) I don't think insurance policies would pay out if you cancelled.I'm starting to confuse myself now though - happy to stand corrected if anyone knows better!Edited: 1:11 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Thats right, you must have the appropriate cancelation cover in order to benefit. So if you have no cancelation cover within your policy, it doesn't matter what the FCO say.Also I don't believe travelling against FCO advice invalidates your whole policy. Only risks pertaining to that specific advice. So for example if the FCO advised against travel due to risk of Terrorism, it shouldn't preclude you from claiming if you were run over by a car.But always best to discuss this with your insurer. And if you're not sure about the answer, try the FOS (Ombudsmen).Edited: 1:15 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Scheduled to travel to Maldives March 25th from the US, going through Qatar. Mostly concerned about the possibility of quarantine, this trip is very expensive and we cannot afford to miss work for a possible 2week of quarantine.. we don’t know what to do yet, just watching but so sad to think about canceling this is our second attempt at a honeymoon.."
"Ongoing to travel on the 10th of March.I cannot cancel my trip (100% lost for tickets and booking now).Very nervous when read daily news, perhaps it would be better not to read anything before trip(As I have read Maldives denied entry from Iran and some Korean cities now. I would appreciate they also restrict entry from Italy. Seems EU is not going to take stronger measures as China. Have very doubled feelings. Maldives is not smth I can afford frequently and decided to travel. I'm afraid situation would be even worse in the next months.  From the other hand news make me very disappointed. - 3 kilos per last 3 days.(((Edited: 1:59 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Endy - what does- 3 kilos per last 3 days.((( mean?I think I've put that on in the last few weeks, I had to change holiday last year due to seaweed in Mexico, then lost a holiday with TC and now this and my pension has taken a dive.Due to travel 5th March."
"""- 3 kilos per last 3 days.((( mean?""Lose my weight after reading news due to stress.In any way going to travel too."
"Can anyone share the latest situation in Maldives and Male Airport? Travelling in 2 weeks, quite concern as we're bringing our 8yo along."
no confirmed cases at present to my knowledge
"Hi all,I am a little bit concerned as I am travelling from Romania (Europe) to Maldives by transiting Milan - Malpensa airport on March 5th.This is my first exotic vacation ever, already paid a lot of money... Any ban coming for those who are transiting Italy will complicate things. I'm not sure about what to do, coming back is scheduled on March 15th by transiting the same Malpensa airport - if that will be still possible... Is there any suggestion?"
Can your tour operator / travel agent help?
"Having travelled there twice, it is not a country I would want to be in if I fell sick. Indeed it is beautiful and it would be heartbreaking not to go, but their health care facilities do not appear equipped to handle a mass outbreak. Not to mention this has been around since 2019, with many travellers to the region over xmas and new year. It's just taking time for people to be tested. If you go, just be prepared you might have to stay if unwell or due to global issues in general you might have to stay there for awhile. It's a tough one."
"No, they cannot :("
"I'd take professional medical advice if I were concerned. But here's my take with my mathematician head on.Aside from the flight/airport, I don't believe the Maldives presents any more risk than London as it stands right now. In fact, given I live in London and my wife is a clinician in a major hospital, a small resort where we'd interact with less people probably presents less risk.However, GoingOS, is correct in that should the worst happen I'd probably be much better off in London. I contracted Malaria as a child on holiday in India. Fortunately the symptoms didn't present until the day we landed home in London. To this day my parents still tell me how lucky that was, as my chances of survival were significantly worse had I been treated in India. At the time it would have likely taken days to diagnose and get me to an appropriate facility in India.I still travel to exotic destinations. The way I look at it i'm substituting one set of risks for another. For example i'm more likely to be hit by a car at home. In the context of COVID-19 the riskiest thing you can do is frequent places where there are lots of people in close proximity. So as I said before the flight/airport poses the greatest risk for a holiday. But to lesser degree so does visiting the supermarket, public transport, busy events, Hospitals, Doctors surgeries, etc. And to place that risk into context, as it stands right now, it's in the ballpark of crossing a busy road rather than base jumping."
Thank you for the time you are taking to respond. Is the Maldives still free from a case of coronavirus? I understand the riskiest part of our travel will be Dubai airport and the aeroplanes. We still have 5 weeks to decide but I'm afraid its not looking good. We have a secondary school shut here in Ireland now with a confirmed case of a student who travelled from an infected region in Italy. So hard to decide.
"We flew to Maldives last Saturday.Heathrow. Very few people with masks, lacking ChineseBahrain. Temperature scanned on arrival, not mobile in ear but big scanners on poles, quite a few in masks, again lacking Chinese, All employees wearing masksOn flight to Male announcements about telling authority on landing if fever etc. Male. Fill out health declaration been to China, Iran etc, scanned at passport control, again on polesAll employees wearing masks BUT not any of the resort reps. Domestic flight, scanned at Passport control, again on poles. In Male hardly any Chinese/Asian/Japanese tourists.At Ayada, have only seen 2 Japanese couples.There are no masks, no sanitising stations/gels etc, nothing mentioned. As a note I have been people watching in the airports plane etc. People with masks wear in high footfall places but when in the lounge remove the mask? On the plane use a wipe all round the tray table, seat rest but then use overhead locker"
"@Frusci, exactly this ""And to place that risk into context, as it stands right now, it's in the ballpark of crossing a busy road rather than base jumping.""Nail On The Head!"
"We may have less chance of getting ill (apart from CV) than normal. I'm taking detol wipes, thanks for mentioning the otherhead lockes will wipe the handle of that to.Are the airlines difinfecting the planes?"
"Honest answer, don't know,Would say possible not with turnaround times. Would you do every journey/leg? Eg Our LHR flight was half hour late, but we still left ""on time"" Eg Our Bahrain Male then went on to Columb, so picked up new passengers, The only thing they do is the ""Spray"" on the leg to Male"
"So I've just spoken to our insurers.We are covered up to €10,000 per person if we are medically unwell before our travel date and this is verified by a doctor.If the Irish Government place a ban on international travel or say that we cannot travel to the Maldives we are only covered €1750 (seems to be the worst possible scenario as our trip cost us €30,000).If we contract coronavirus over there we are covered up to 10,000,000 in medical expenses.I wonder should we look at trying to change our travel dates to later in the year???? So confused. Look forward to anyone who is clear minded and can help :)"
"Hi, I feel clear minded (who is to say whether that is really the case though?!)...my question would be, if you were to change it, when would you change it to? For example, when do you think this initial impact may all be over? If you erred on the side of caution and moved it, say, a whole year away, what if the vaccine isn't commercially available, and even if it is, not in the quantities required, and the ant--virals aren't ready...could there be another travel-disrupting peak then?FWIW, (I may be repeating myself - I can't remember, which in itself doesn't bode well!) we were never really too concerned about the trip we've just been on, but have been a bit more concerned all along for our trip booked in June, and remain a bit concerned about whether that could be disrupted..."
"Thanks Maldiva very helpful. This is true. One cannot tell what will happen in one month, 6 months etc. Moving the dates does not seem to be a helpful action."
"""If the Irish Government place a ban on international travel or say that we cannot travel to the Maldives we are only covered €1750 (seems to be the worst possible scenario as our trip cost us €30,000).""So you only have cancelation cover ~€1750 (pp or total) for a holiday costing €30k?I'd be tempted to bring it forward if at all possible. Or if I was going to push it back, i'd move it to next year. If this is still going on next year, I suspect a holiday will be the least of our worries :/How did you book the holiday? Might be worth checking with the supplier(s) to see if they can offer any comfort if you're forced to cancel."
"I'm not sure when you are due to travel, but if I was going to move it, I also would bring it forward."
"I think there are 2 separate risks here. The primary risk, actually becoming seriously ill/dying from Covid-19andThe secondary risk presented by the general level of global concern over the virus, so risks like being flights being grounded/enforced quarantine/stranded far from home (or even at home) These are different things and I think it important to take them separately. Personally, as a healthy adult I am unconcerned about the primary risk, but as a person travelling in the next 7 days ,taking 3 different flights and transiting through 3 different airports, I am very concerned about the secondary risk. Also, I'm sorry to say that the idea of putting risk in context using 'whatabout-ery' results in a logical fallacy - (only) 423 people died from AIDS in the UK last year, far fewer than the 700 odd that died from Flu. Doesn't stop most people from being far more concerned about HIV infection than Flu. The problem is, we just don't know what Covid-19 holds for the future - it may well prove to be a big old panic over nothing, but we don't know that, and therefore have nothing at upon which to base our decision making.Edited to add that, if I had any option, I wouldn't be going at all (I'm secretly hoping the FCO changes its advice in the next week so my insurance will pay out). I feel that any unnecessary travel is pretty irresponsible at the moment and hate the idea that I am soon to become part of the problem :(Edited: 8:59 am, March 02, 2020 "
@ppply glad I didn't whack my thumb by mistake :)I'm more worried about having a coughing fit as I leave the plane. I rarely get off a long haul flight without the sniffles.Have images of that seen from Monsters Inc:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUFJ1yVhJ6g
"Hi Frusci we have cancellation cover of up to €10,000 euro each and there are 3 of us travelling. This covers the cost of our trip. However the insurance company said that if there is a blanket ban on travel we are covered under travel disruption and this only covers €1,750.We are due to travel 5th April!Edited: 9:04 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Mayday, so if you cancel for any reason you have 10k of cover, but if you cancel after a travel ban is imposed that is limited to 1.750?Could you not just cancel now, before a ban is imposed and take the 10k?"
Hi Miriam cancellation payout is only with a medical certificate. But interesting point. It does seem ridiculous doesn't it? Thank you.
"maydayI'd call them and double check what constitutes disruption and what constitutes cancelation in the context of COVID-19. You are pretty exposed in the ""disruption"" scenario, i'd want to understand what that covers so I can consider the likely hood of each event. And also should one of those events become more likely, I can try to change my dates/etc."
"""Hi Miriam cancellation payout is only with a medical certificate. But interesting point. It does seem ridiculous doesn't it? Thank you.""Give your OH a gentle push down the stairs :D(NB: I'm joking of course)."
"Excellent idea Frusci. Thank you and I'll do that now.Edited to say I'll make the phone call and not push hubby down the stairs!! :) :)Edited: 9:11 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Suppose the hardest is expectation. I have some feeling that situation in future can be even worse. I mean more flights cancellation and longer checks in the airport of your travel history etc.I would bring my trip forward too if possible)Edited: 9:22 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Miriam LouetteCOVID-19 reared its head ~3 months ago, it could be months before this plays out. These events aren't actually that rare. If we start jumping the gun on the basis of ""we don't know where this will lead"", we'd seriously impact world trade and peoples lives.To us it may seem like a zero sum game, but to ~half the people on the planet, the economic impact of restricting travel/transport will also cost lives. They do'nt have workers rights, a welfare state to fall back on, free healthcare, etc, etc.When the models/evidence indicate on balance it's prudent to restrict travel, then that is the time I'd choose not to travel. But until then I don't feel turning off the economic taps is the right thing to do."
mayday:D the edit made me chuckle.
"Hi all, my husband and I have just got back from a week in the Maldives and we flew Air Sri Lanka via Colombo from Heathrow. Other than a lot of people wandering around with face masks (and all flight crew) everything went smoothly and we didn’t encounter any problems. The only problem is here as I work for the NHS and sit in a building with district nurses, OTs, dieticians and physios so my falling ill is unthinkable. I had a coughing fit in front of a senior DN this morning and she was extremely concerned as we had just been discussing NHS protocols for the virus. My bosses have urged me to call 111 but, to be honest, I don’t know what to do as I’m not showing any symptoms. In my humble opinion, your long anticipated trips to the Maldives will be fine, I suspect it’s when you get home that the issues will begin. BTW we had the best time! I hope everyone gets the outcome they wish for. Good luck!"
"There was some impressive hacking away on our flight back. Not, in fact, too worrying as I believe we are looking out for a dry cough, whereas this was noisily productive (repeatedly)...and may have been related to the contents of the clear duty free bag. I’m sure she must have felt self conscious though!"
Thanks everyone. I thought I'd update and let you know that after serious consideration of risks involved we have decided to postpone our trip until October or December. Hope you all stay safe and enjoy your holidays :)
"Well our bucket list/once in a lifetime trip will probably be cancelled (vs. delayed). Husband's employer now mandates that anyone traveling through/to/from South Korea has to self-quarantine for 14 days after they return. He doesn't have 4.5 weeks of vacation time to use in that event.Our US-based travel insurance also doesn't cover ""government regulations"", and their ""work reason"" coverage doesn't cover this either.However, if Korean Air cancels the flight, then we have an ""option"" in terms of getting some money back, but won't be able to re-schedule for 4-6 years as it'll take me that long to accrue enough miles again (we had to plan this 3 years ago as it is now), plus by then the cost of the Maldives resorts will have probably gone up 30%.Fingers crossed that something turns around (for the positive) by 4/14/20, but not holding out much hope. Very disappointed to say the least.I hope the rest of you have better luck/coverage than we do."
"Don't cancel till you have to because just no way of knowing what will happen in almost 6 weeks. can you just not do the last bit and get a flight home? can you work from home?We have been told to take our laptops each night incase we need to work from home, that's if we are going away or not.The way it works in the UK is if Foreign office says don't travel my tour operator should give a refund.Program on the flood just come on - puts it in prospective - but don't think I'll watch up depressed enough."
"@runnelstone:We're crossing fingers at this point and won't cancel until just prior to the departure.I'm going to have to spend another $1,500 USD (*non-refundable) to get alternate flights home (have to buy the miles I'm short) and will ""lose"" the $1,200 in taxes on the previous award flight (if it's not cancelled).Unfortunately husband has a job that cannot be done remotely.Oh well, this teaches a lesson to never buy an insurance policy that has ""government regulations"" as an exclusion. It's almost impossible to get a CFAR policy in New York because of a rule-making opinion from our Tax & Finance dept. that said it's not a valid form of ""insurance"" and thus, licensed insurance companies are prohibited from selling it."
mjonis - sounds very wrong that you can't insure.I remember going to renew are annual ins and checking to discover the policy didn't cover Cuba because it was backed by American company - we had to change companies.Never easy to find dive insurance with good cover and now OH is getting old it's worse. At least he's retired and I should be able to work from home if I need to.
im going in 7 weeks im worried too
We are scheduled to travel on March 25. Any feedback from travellers who have gone there in the last week
"Just returned a few days ago. A few coughers and sneezers at breakfast, but most of your time is spent in the room anyway and actually felt more safe/secluded there than back home. The airports were, however, a different story. Would recommend a mask or some form of protection esp. if you’re passing through a transit hub for high risk countries."
Yes we fly in anout 3 weeks via Dubia
"Hello,have you been there already.. is everything ok there.."
"The mask is for sick people, healthy people don't need them. You get infected even with a face mask. This advice is all over the internet..."
"Interesting info COVID19 - STATUS QUO: MORE RECOVERIES THAN DISEASESThe new coronavirus is spreading worldwide. Everywhere there is talk of new infections/diseases, but what is the number of recoveries ? Because only with both values, together with the number of diseases with a fatal course, a recognizable tendency of development can be seen.The renowned US-American Johns Hopkins University developed an interactive overview in real time.The maps are updated several times a day with data collected by Johns Hopkins University from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other sources.Currently (5 March 2020 - 15.13 GMT) we have the following current global values: confirmed Diseases: 96,888 - Recoveries: 53,638 - Deaths: 3,305If one compares these values with the figures of the past few days, one can see that the number of recoveries is currently well above the number of new cases.As a consequence, this means that even if the expansion of the area is progressing, i.e. there are isolated infections in new regions, the number of diseases is decreasing in comparison to the number of recoveries.If you want to get an idea of the current figures, you can find the link to the data collection of Johns Hopkins University herehttps:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
We've just cancelled our trip in May whilst we had the chance to recover most of the money. If it was just my choice I would have still gone but the wife was more worried and we just don't know what will happen in the next two months. Its annoying as we were really looking forward to it. But in the grand scheme of things with people dying its not that much of a hardship. I almost wish we had got to the point of no return regarding getting no money back as the decision would have been out of our hands.Best of luck to those that still go.
We are checked in and flying tomorrow evening via Doha. I think I will only completely relax when we have cleared immigration in Male!

"Hi, can you please share the situation at airport and Maldives once you arrive? We're flying in 1 week. Still in dilemma :("
What the story in airports
"Those travelling to the Maldives from Australia via Singapore, there's a great article here which tells you exactly what to expect. At present it appears to be business as usual in the Maldives, providing you can get their safely. https:/…"
The Maldives airport situation is documented really well in this article: https:/…
"Arrived today in Maldive from Milan with Alitalia. Everything was ok on the airport, they have a thermocamera and scan everyone instead of taking manually the temperature like in Milan. The security staff looks very professional. This is my first time in Maldives, people are really nice. Until now I don't regret that I did not cancel the vacation.Edited: 6:26 am, March 06, 2020 "

"So why do doctors and nurses bother to wear masks???Edited: 10:14 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Because used correctly, in a medical setting, they offer a protection that isn't replicated by people using them for their tube journey."
"""So why do doctors and nurses bother to wear masks???""Most of them don't. None of my wifes colleagues are wearing them (she works in a major hospital in London).When they do wear them, they are often to protect the patient, rather than the clinician. For example during surgery or another invasive procedure. She doesn't want to cough and introduce her own bugs when she's sticking a needle in your eye or treating a major wound for example. Or to prevent any fluid (blood/saliva) accidentally entering the clinicians mouth. Either directly or because they involuntarily touch their mouth during a procedure.They aren't used for long term exposure to an airborne contagion. For that they are suitably suited up (she experienced that as part of her training).She says the only protection offered by wearing a cloth mask during your day (wrt COVID-19) is it prevents you touching your mouth. You should probably wear glasses as well if that appeals to you. Not sure what you'd do with your nose. And of course you have to ensure you properly wash your hands (that doesnt mean a dab of soap followed by a splash of water, google how medical professionals wash their hands), before you remove the mask.If it makes you feel better, go for it :)"
"Friends at Kuredu from Sweden just gave an interview, the island is in lockdown due confirmed cases of Corona. We were just planning our next trip to Lux North this time for next year but think we will cancel those plans.. And we were at The Standard in the beginning of January this year with surely 90% of guest from China(absolutely no offense) so glad we’ve been lucky twice in a very unfortunate situation for the entire world."
"Not sure if anyones seen this from BBC website?First two cases confirmed in MaldivesTwo patients have tested positive for coronavirus in the Maldives - the first cases in the south Asian country, its health ministry says.Local reports say the pair are employees of four-star hotel, the Kuredi Island Resort.The government has been taking precautions to try to prevent the spread of the virus, including a temporary ban on all cruise ships entering and docking in the Maldives.Ah see someone has just started a thread on this.Edited: 12:10 pm, March 07, 2020 "
Are you Still travelling?
With very hard feelings decided to cancel this year trip. I've already been to Maldives but I'm strongly disappointed. It is really perfect place for resort( I made a reservation in the beginning of February on the 10th of March. The situation was more or less optimistic in February.However not ready to spend this vacation on the island with fear to be under lockdown.
"@Bronia, thanks for that. Yes, there are a couple of other threads running and that information is on at least one of them.Unsettling times wherever in the world we are."
Yes me too worried
"Dianna thanks. Yes we are living in unchartered territory now.I have several European trips booked as well as Mauritius in June, the first to Athens in just over a week and find myself wavering at times.Safe trips!"
"My husband and I are scheduled to fly to the Maldives next week for our wedding anniversary. This would be our first trip, and a very expensive one that we have really been looking forward to. But we are both 66 yrs old and have a few underlying health conditions such as asthma. Even though we would lose almost a million hotel points, and a lot of money on the 32 hr flights from the US, we are thinking about canceling. With two resorts in the Maldives already on lock down, and our risk factors, we are considering cancelling our reservations."
"I saw they now have a newly built quarantine facility - I wonder how this fits into the plan. I wouldn’t mind being quarantined on a resort island - but would mind in a purpose built facility. I can’t find any further info (apart from it now exists), so I am not sure how it will be utilised."
since you have already paid， its better to go. its nth like a cruise ship. just have some extra protection on the way like using masks， or buy a plastic rain coat to sheild your sitting areathe only way it can transmit so far is by droplets getting in your mouth nose and eyes in which case its not that hard to protectunless the situation in the states is nth like that is on news， you should be fine. once you are out of aircraft， single masks will be enough.
"Well, I'm packed and ready to go - car coming at 9am tomorrow. Not sure how I feel about the whole thing tbh, obviously excited to go, but very much hoping I make it to my island without hinderance. Anyway, I'm tooled up with anti bac wipes and have made tentative logistical arrangements for a situation in which I would have to self-isolate upon my return. Apart from that, I'm hoping for the best...!"
"My husband and I are scheduled to fly out on March 19th for the Maldives. We leave out of the Pitt airport, connecting through O’Hare, and then Abu Dhabi to Male. We are both 66 with some underlying health issues such as asthma. This would be a long awaited wedding anniversary trip for us and very expensive. But we are seriously considering cancelling due to our personal risk level, even though we will lose the money for the flights and lose the almost million Hilton points. It’s a very scary, sad, and frustrating situation. If we were younger and in better health I would risk it. But I think we’ll have to cancel."
""" just have some extra protection""That gave me a flashback to high school sex ed lessons :) Although not sure a condom would be much use lol"
"Oh Hummingbird, I'm so sorry...you're right, it is so scary and frustrating.Not sure how it works in the US, but might your doctor sign you medically unfit so you could make an insurance claim?"
"I don't know Frusci, could perhaps put it over my head? ;) At this point, its a case of 'any port in a storm'"
That image did cross my mind :)
Surely this wont still be a problem in July/August? Please say it wont :(
"The problem is, nobody knows. It might all be a big fuss about nothing, or it might spell the end of days. Personally, my money's on the former, but in reality, nobody can tell you for sure."
"The other problem is, if you were to book now, should you have to cancel due to COVID-19 I fear insurers may try to wriggle out of paying.I'd get confirmation I was covered for cancelation before making a new booking.Edited: 4:59 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"I heard on the news earlier that the number of new cases in Wuhan is dropping dramatically day by day, so that's at least a bit of good news."

Do we know which islands?
"Captain, to make it worse when I look at some social media’s, I found it astonished that people ( ‘foreign expats’ works as models ) back from the UK who supposed to quarantine himself for two weeks in Bei Jing after he landed, but he instead went to his daily exercises downstairs of the house compact of where he lives, to the park and supermarket, and he posted it on local v-blogs! During the quarantined he just kept go downstairs daily?!I seriously think he is lack of awareness of how he can be a super spreader in case he has caught it in Europe, he is spreading it everywhere whilst he supposed to be staying home which was the condition of his re-entering China.Having said that, he must not be the only one who never thought carefully of the consequences he caused in case he already caught virus, which leads my other thoughts to LindyLouisa. — thé corona virus is manageable only if you took appropriate actions and only wash your hands religiously is very far from enough."
"""tell out right lies to its public 80% will self heal and you dont need masks""Captain, I can't comment on the rest of the US's approach, but those two statements are not outright lies. Most specialists in the west agree for ~80% of people COVID-19 will be a mild illness and they will self heal. In fact many think that figure is higher, as many cases will go unreported with people believing they just have a cold. Moreover, the efficacy of face masks outside a controlled medical environment with short term contact is questionable in preventing infection. My wife works in a busy hospital and none of her colleagues are wearing them.As I understand it there are two reasons there is a concerted effort to control the spread of COVID-19:1) Whilst it is a mild illness for most people, for ~20% it is a serious illness and for ~1-3% it is deadly. If 100 people in the population catch COVID-19, then that means 20 that will have a serious illness and need medical treatment. And ~1-3 that will ultimately die. If 1 million catch it, that means 200,000 people that will suffer a serious illness. Most medical systems can't cope with 200,000 extra people (above the norm) of seriously ill people. As a result its likely a higher proportion will likely die. You can build hospitals overnight, but you can't train medical staff, build respirators/etc or synthesise anti virals over night.So the effort to contain and/or slow down spread is to limit the number of infected or spread them out to ensure they don't overwhelm the medical care systems.2) COVID-19 has managed to mutate and jump the species barrier. Once a virus achieves this, there's always concern it will mutate again. With new strains becoming more contagious, dangerous or both.Every infected person is another opportunity for COVID-19 to roll the dice for ~2 weeks and create a worse strain. Dangerous mutations are rare, as ultimately a Virus doesn't want to kill its hosts. But it still holds the more opportunities and time it is given, the greater the risk COVID-19 will take a wrong turn and a more dangerous mutation will occur.Edited: 4:06 am, March 09, 2020 "
I read every piece of news aboard. officially，its 80% mild and self recover and no need to wear masks. but stories unfolded in wuhan as well as italy tell a different story. in the light of a brand new virus against humanity， how can the CDC be so sure of how the way it goes？ unless they know something other dont， if everyone takes the data from China ， its a out right lie just to stop panicwith regards to the person who wouldnt quarantine himself back in uk . thats my point .it could never happen in China. I will give you examples1 someone who had never been back to wuhan during the time but with a wuhan identify card： must quarantine . you go out in winter in shorts， you get taken down becos you if u get a cold u becomes a threat to others. some ppl traffic friends in car boot to condo， he get taken down. you cook with too much smoke you cough， police come in full body suitsyes there isnt the rights as you guys have in europe， but it make society safeif the guy can do whatever he want with out quarantine， thats a problem to all， since globalization means eventually it will come back to china when ppl elsewhere dont enforce the rules
I mis read the modelling guy， I thought its the other way round. so far we only started monitor ppl from few countries with outbreaks which didnt include uk. the quarantine is mostly self enforced from non epidemic places， everyone follow the rules becos we are scared to pass to loved ones. the situation with western ppl has always been more relaxed due to international image， and rights issues. unless the situation get worse， he is free to do so. the whole idea is based on community and self enforcement， and trust me everyone is scared to death in beijng. when we look at situations outside china where in the west no one wears masks， we were really suprised. masks do help it stopps droplets
"To my mind this forum, unlike much social media and other conversations, has been been very conscientious in not pointing fingers at any nationality with regard to the outbreak or early handling/reporting. With this in mind, in my opinion, it would be nice to continue without pointing fingers at other nationalities/people if possible.Edited: 5:23 am, March 09, 2020 "
"The models are developed based on previous outbreaks and what we already understand about this type of virus. As well as the evidence gathered about the current outbreak.I don't know about Wuhan, but nothing that's happened in Italy so far contradicts the modelling and conclusions drawn by the specialists.Whilst Trumps comment has received the most press internationally, the 80% estimate is not conjured up by politicians. It is one put forward by respected experts in the field. They could of course be wrong. But I don't think they are deliberately misleading people. One or two may be persuaded to lie by politicians, but I doubt there would be a consensus to lie amongst dozens who have dedicated their lives to this field. At the very least they have a reputation to protect.With over 100k cases worldwide, it would become pretty obvious if more then 80% suffered serious illness. Particularly in the West where we have a free press and freedom of speech allowing news to spread quickly. Take Italy as an example, the confirmed cases are ~7k, with 366 deaths. Going by the 80% figure, that leaves ~1400 cases with severe illness. If the truth deviated from that by any margin, Doctors and and Nurses working in Italian hospitals would soon blow the whistle."
"""With over 100k cases worldwide, it would become pretty obvious if more then 80% suffered serious illness.""Sorry this should say:""With over 100k cases worldwide, it would become pretty obvious if more then ~20% suffered serious illness."""
we should look at facts than hypothesis. in China since the very start， mask is a must and no matter how mild you are， if you are suspected， you get taken away ，no question asked， yes even you are suspected not confirmed， you get taken away. now most cities have single to 0 new cases. some may argue its fake stats by ccp. if thats the case， gossips would be everywhere already. they could blind the foreign media but they cant blind 30 million ppl in beijing.In beijing at least， the general consensus is that the out of china situation isnt looking good， thats why ppl fly back to shelter thus the imported casesat the end of the day， we are all on the same line， lets just hope， the US and the rest of the west is doing enough， otherwise the consequences will be beyond imagination ，like the 30% jaw droppin oil price nose dive today
"Captain WRT masks I think you should consider the difference between correlation and causation.There is no evidence the general population wearing masks makes any difference. As I said my wife and her colleagues don't wear them in a major London hospital. If there was any evidence it mitigated the risk of infection they would be. Moreover, it's important to appreciate this is not a zero sum equation. For the privileged (and I include almost everyone in the West), the impact of severe restrictions may not affect their lives. But for ~3 Billion people, that don't have workers rights and social security, severe restrictions will cost lives. If we pull the economic plug how will they feed their families?Sometimes theirs no easy answer. People will suffer either way now. All governments can do is try to minimise the suffering. Take the least worst approach."
"Captain, that guy confessed in his video of himself that he supposed to be ‘quarantined’ after he landed in Beijing, I don’t know if the reason behind was he had also been to other countries in Europe in the last 14 days before he landed in BeiJing, apparently can be visiting not only the country he flew from... due to I was never following him and the AI just randomly fed me people had keep fit plans this winter. He doesn’t post all his life on v-blog and I can’t comment if he has travelled to other parts of Europe but suspected so..,One of his comment in the video was ‘ oh I suppose to be quarantined, but what do I do in the next 14 days? So bored if not going out, so this is my way of quarantine, going downstairs to exercises everyday, by wearing a mask...’ and you will be amazed by the way he wore the mask...To all, I saw the different views of some interesting topics here, I think time will tell, by the end of next month we will see.Edited: 6:06 am, March 09, 2020 "
"‘ Particularly in the West where we have a free press and freedom of speech allowing news to spread quickly.’— nah, not always the case, Trump says doctors aren’t allowed to comment independently, things will have to go through Pence...Besides, for the earlier comment of ‘You can build hospitals overnight, but you can't train medical staff, build respirators/etc or synthesise anti virals over night.’— to me a ‘hospital’ without medical staffs in it isn’t a hospital, sounds more like a concentration camp if you really put patient there. However I can see that we agree on my point one of the essentials for controlling the covid-19 1) sufficient medical workers and equipments. I very much doubt if any place can build a ‘hospital’ itself overnight, neither do I think the capacity of most countries have caught up by covid-19 have enough medical workers and equipments... fingers crossed for everyone, esp at this thread, those who are due to travel to Maldives."
"""‘ Particularly in the West where we have a free press and freedom of speech allowing news to spread quickly.’— nah, not always the case, Trump says doctors aren’t allowed to comment independently, things will have to go through Pence...""Trump can say what he likes. Despite media reports to the contrary the US is not an authoritarian state. No one is going to be thrown in prison for whistleblowing and telling the truth.Hence, my point is it's much much harder to suppress the truth WRT COVID-19. If it isn't true that 80% of people suffer a mild illness, there is absolutely nothing Trump or any other Western politician can do to suppress that information. Doctors, Nurses and specialists would soon blow the whistle and start telling the truth openly.Edited: 6:53 am, March 09, 2020 "
"In fact there are people talk about the covid -19 in none official channels but that’s very much about it. — he surely says stupid things often but, why I read less of the covid-19 related public statements than before his announcement?Also I wasn’t really interests in the conversation of theoretically speaking etc... hypothesis always has to adapt with new changes and have to correct itself. my earlier replies were only based on facts but not ‘in theory this and that will happen’... after reading the conversation between you and captain, I think you two have different emphasis: you are focus on the % of death rate is accurate, he was, at least originally intend to focus on the prevention of further spread (and potentially masks are useful, but I am not him so I don’t fully know. P.S. no need reply to me going back to loops of whether masks are useful— time will tell very soon, in a month’s time and let’s see.)To most people who live on this earth, the % it’s important and good to know regardless it’s right or not, we will see this in the next few months, but it isn’t really the most important thing to them.There is a huge difference between 2million people caught it, among which x% dead, and 0.2 million people caught it, among which x% dead, in a given region. How about the region can’t control the spread and it just goes beyond 10minfection and even the number of x% stays the same, so what? How do we stop the infection itself?I guess the most important question is how to limit the spread instead of ‘ I know the death rate already’. More and more people will loose their lives and if the spread isn’t under controlled, regardless the x% stays the same.As I said in my earlier example, it’s not easy to get things under controlled. I hope people think of a better solution, to limit the spreading, sort things out quicker and better, instead of just ‘ let it be.’Edited: 7:18 am, March 09, 2020 "

"Hi All,We go to the Maldives in 2 weeks and the plan is still to go...were a young couple 27 & 31. Were expecting things to be a bit more crazy at the airports but I'm also fully expecting our flights from Heathrow via Dubai to be a lot quieter than normal and I expect our resort (Centara grand) to be quieter too. I would be lying if I didn't say I'm anxious but this is once in a life time trip for our belated honeymoon so unless the British Government say otherwise we'll still be going. Is anyone out there currently and give us an update on what things are like?Edited: 7:48 am, March 09, 2020 "
"·“ Not sure where you're reading :). There's been wall to wall coverage across the European news media for months. From specialists, Doctors, Nurses and right down to the man/woman on the street.”Firstly my bad, I mean less public statements through official channels SINCE his ( trumps ) statement, not before his statement. That might confused some. But still, hold on, I thought we have been talking about the US official channels’ approach just days after trumps statement last week? (He said doctors aren’t allowed to comment independently )I never think Trump’s arms are that long and can impact the European media, esp even before his speech. ;)"
"I presumed you were talking about my comment which you quoted:"" Particularly in the West where we have a free press and freedom of speech allowing news to spread quickly.""Wether it's the US or EU, I think that comment is true. Trumps comments have little bearing on it. Our politicians simply don't have the ability to suppress information this magnitude by making a proclamation like Trump has. There's considerable separation between public health bodies and the government. There are independent NGO's. And if all else fails, our Doctors and Nurses are professionally obliged to tell the truth. If there were hundreds more dying or thousands more on respirators in critical care units, theres not a thing Trump could do to prevent the people working in those facilities telling the world. In short I think you're putting too much weight on Trump and Government channels. They aren't all important here."
"Thanks,Maldiva.Actually I have read all the post in this thread.But would like to know if there are others like myself worried about proceeding after the 4 new cases in Maldives."
"Hi Alex S,I will be going to the same resort as you this weekend.Shall update the situation if I m there."
"Honestly, if I could have cancelled, I would have done. I couldn't (not without losing all the money I had paid) so here I sit at Heathrow waiting for my flight. The airport is eerily quiet, I just literally walked straight through check in and security, not even a hint of a queue."
Have a safe trip Miriam. Hopefully the worries disappear once you get the sand between your toes.We're off to Mauritius in two weeks. Still planning to go right now and hoping we're not forced to cancel.
"Hi Frusci, My original wording reply to you was ‘ nah, not ALWAYS the case.’As a president he surely brings himself a good example of how much ‘FREEDOM’ there is. That’s why it’s pretty much a classic example. Given 2020 is going to be the election year things getting more exciting about what he says and who the public supports. What he did was very much contradicting the ‘ freedom of speech’ in fact any one can see it is very far away from letting others to enjoy their ‘ freedom of speech.’ re this matter. I was replying to the following quote of your comment in case our conversation goes on too much : ‘ Particularly in the West where we have a free press and freedom of speech allowing news to spread quickly.’My original response: ‘ nah, not ALWAYS the case, Trump says doctors aren’t allowed to comment independently, things will have to go through Pence...’— I never said West is only US, but neither did I see anything wrong with bring up the thoughts from a typical person - the president who is 100% from the WEST. What weights the west media wasn’t really my problem, this conversation has been led to some interests corner... And to reply to your interests comment,‘In short I think you're putting too much weight on Trump and Government channels. They aren't all important here.’ — well thanks for reminding the weighting thing, I never really consider the weighting thing, now that you draw my attention on this ‘weighting’ matter, of course what the US president said to his country and the world matters, he at least has far more audiences than you do..."
"SunflowersblI think you're completely missing the point. What Trump says is irrelevant. Freedom of speech is enshrined in US law and most Western Countries. You are assigning way too much weight to his comment. Perhaps in your country a politician saying something like that would constrain ones freedom to speak out, but in the West it certainly doesn't.If the truth was COVID-19 is more deadly, there are more serious cases, etc there is absolutely nothing Trump can do to prevent people speaking out about it. No one would be thrown in jail. The state wouldn't hound them or their family. One can pretty much speak out with impunity. As can NGO's, etc.So i'm really struggling to understand your conclusions. I can only surmise you're interpreting the impact of his statements in the context of the effect they'd have in your own country if your president (or equivalent) had made them. Half the country detests Trump and regularly say so on TV/Internet/Print Media lol. If he had the power to shut people up he'd have long since used it on those that deride him daily.Edited: 9:31 am, March 09, 2020 "
Brilliant thanks Leo that would be great. I have been keeping an eye on the resort's instagram and reviews people have been putting on here and all looks good. We can't wait to go!
"@Miriam Louette, I hope you have a wonderful, relaxing holiday and hat all of your worries will come to nought.Don’t worry that the airport may have been quiet because it may be that they were all in my local Tesco buying loo rolls and hand wash. The pasta and rice shelves were pretty cleaned out and tinned vegetables rationed! It is usually very quiet on a Monday when I normally grocery shop but not today, it was packed. Bonkers! I don’t know why they need all the toilet rolls if so much rice and pasta is going to be consumed, everyone will be constipated, lol.Edited: 9:41 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Hi Frusci, it very interesting to hear your comment that : ‘ I think you're completely missing the point.’- I can see that you don’t like my opinion but unfortunately I am entitled to my opinions. You are free to accuse I didn’t get the point, but vise versa, so can I accuse you missing the whole point too ...and our conversation has led to nowhere. firstly I was accused of ‘In short I think you're putting too much weight on Trump and Government channels.’ Then being accused ‘ I think you're completely missing the point.’My point was based on what people already did but not what ‘ I think bla bla bla’ Then even worse ‘Perhaps in your country a politician saying something like that would constrain ones freedom to speak out, but in the West it certainly doesn't.’ —- the above comment is very similar to what you replied often— hypothesis needs to be adjusts every now and then( a lot of ‘ I think ‘ ) and unfortunately many of which not based on facts but again, on your thinking and liking.I can see that you decided I don’t know ‘ West’ well only due to the location. Out of curious how many times have you been to Asia? How often and long have you stayed in Asia? How well do you know Asian? Were those hypothesis of ‘Perhaps in your country a politician saying something like that would constrain ones freedom to speak out, but in the West it certainly doesn't.’ Was it a statement through your own personal experience when you are living and growing up in an Asian country or from others’ word of mouth? How do you have so much confident on your opinions towards some other countries locates 5k miles + away? Where does that confident come from? Do you write, read and speak any Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Philippine etc etc? I am very curious now. But I clearly have other better things to do...however if I live in that kind of country in your fantasy land I might as well can’t even get surfing on this forum. ;)Good luck for those who are coming to Maldives soon! Like I said in my other posts, I travelled to Maldives at the outbreak of H1N1 from Europe, I actually think there were people already caught it and travelling in the same plane. Infected guests might even stayed at the same resort. If any of you have decided to travel, enjoy your holiday., but precautions are necessarily. If it stress you out too much, don’t go and stay safe with your beloved ones, support each other during this difficult times! Bon voyages!"
did you see the market？ and the article “no symptom to death in hours”this is bad ， this gone way beyond borders，nationality whatever you can think of to differentiate
"Yes captain, the market isn’t doing well, UK down 7%,Germany 8% and Italy 10%. It doesn’t really surprised me. More than a month ago I already posted here that the global impact of covid-19 might as well triggered a long dued fiancial crisis given how bad the European financial market has been since 2008, which was in fact never recovered. Then the bubbles at Stock Market, Debt Capital Market in thé US will be poked, as a result those who are graduating this year from uni might as well joined the Job market at the worst possible time, and unemployment rate will go from bad to worse. I hope hotels in Maldives gets ready for the future declining arrivals due to both covid-19 and financial crisis... I was going to joke maybe the WWIII will be triggered by fighting masks against each other,( the current situation between Swiss and German etc) but this is not funny and I took it back.Edited: 11:44 am, March 09, 2020 "
"I dont quite understand the way our no 1 power in the world handles the outbreak. the latest news is that some elders with no symptoms die in hours . maybe 80% ppl just self recover， lets just say its true for now， its also widely accepted death rate for elder is very high. so basicly the government just let those fit people running around spreading the viruses to the old who may face dire consequences？ if its regarded as nth more than a cold for young people， why would they take it seriously？the government is playing the survival of fittest game？a few moments ago， hongkong stopped 5 ppl from india who are all positive. bear in mind india doesnt have epidemic. it seems lots governments are lying and play passive. thats not a good sign at all， I would say 1918+1930 combo is a educated guessEdited: 12:06 pm, March 09, 2020 "

"Hello there, do you have any update about Paradise Island Resort? We have flight tommorow 12pm through Doha... we would cancle but refunds from hotel were misserable compared to price paid..."
As of now I understand the only confirmed cases (6) of the virus are at Kuredu and Sandies Bathala.
"Thailand is considered at risk and we have only reported 0.7 cases per million people.Edited: 11:35 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Whereas the Maldives has 6 cases in a population of under 500,000. Which is the same as 12 cases per million people. That gives the Maldives a case rate that is SEVENTEEN times higher than Thailand, even though I think Thailand is vastly under reporting."
"Quick Update, we are here now, at Milaidhoo, Baa Atoll. We arrived 7 days ago. We leave this afternoon for the US via Istanbul.New airport procedures in Male:1.) Thermal screening2.) Health questionnaire 3.) Passport and Visa check for Italy, China, South Korea - Denied entryThey have quarantined two resorts, as others here have mentioned. Those people quarantined @ their resort will most likely be extending their vacation for 14 days, unknown on who’s dime. Resort staff here taking hygiene very seriously and hand sanitizer has been put everywhere, all food service tables are fully turned and wiped down every time. They are also asking you point blank to use it when you check in for meals and when you leave from meals.Those arriving soon may be less likely to have an issue as they banned entry from the hottest areas more than 7 days ago. Symptoms typically show in 5 days.It is ultimately your decision, but these islands are pretty small and there isn’t a lot of group activities or nightlife. If you stick to eating hot/non buffet food, snorkelIng, sunbathe on your deck and use good cleanliness you should be fine. Airports are most likely your largest risk."
"Thanks for the update Patrick that’s really helpful. We fly out in 2 weeks and current plan is still to travel. We’re expecting airports to be biggest risk but they could also be deserted as a lot of people won’t travel, same goes for our flights they could be half empty as well. Good to hear there taking it seriously."
"Guys,We've just left Maafushi island, we are now on the Paradise island resort. Everythink ok in Maldives except for the daytime cancelled trips to resorts from Maafushi.They are checking the temperatures when arriving in resorts, but everything seems to be stable.Kind regards!"
"Hi PatrickWe are due to fly on Monday from UK via Dubai to Paradise Island, for a much awaited “bucket list” holiday.We are only there for 5 nts and the back to Dubai for 5 ntsWe are a couple in mid 60s and if we don’t go, I don’t think we will ever go.We also stand to lose all costs, TA wants to charge £260 each if we only want to use Dubai flights, and cancel Maldives.At present still undecided, it is being quarantined that’s my main concernJames"
Kuramathi is on lockdown now due to foreigner showing signs of covid-19 https://raajje.mv/72904
"Hi allThanks everyone for the useful updates. We are due to fly to Dhigura and then Biyadoo on Sunday (via UAE). My wife and I are both 34, but my wife has mild Asthma. We are still undecided. We would potentially lose some money too if we decide not to go (around 2k)...."
"Due to arrive to Gili on Saturday morning.I have been in contact with the resort quite frequently. They have been amazing. They are now doing temperature screenings at the resort entrance. I think this is somehow reassuring. I’m very excited for my trip, albeit being concerned as well.Edited: 7:20 am, March 10, 2020 "
"jiiimseWho are you flying with?Might be an idea to contact the Airline directly. Normally if you don't use the first leg of a flight ( i.e in this case MLE->DXB) you can't use the second leg. Which is why the TA is probably quoting the extra £260 if you skip the Maldives.But given the circumstances some airlines are starting to show flexibility with regard to changing flights/dates. So might be worth contacting the Airline.Wether only doing the DXB part of the holiday is less risky I'm not too sure. I suspect if the worst happened Dubai's medical system is better. But in terms of catching COVID-19, I'm not sure the Maldives represents a bigger danger then Dubai. I suspect the Airport/Flight is your biggest risk factor in this respect."

"Hey Alex, we are in a similar situation, second attempt at a honeymoon. Leave the US in 15 days, still really want to go. Mainly worried about getting quarantined. Does anyone know if you are quarantined at your resort if your charged? This is such an expensive trip and I’m worried if we happen to get quarantined we can’t afford it, if we have to pay to stay.!.?"
"SandyM, I have been hoping to be able to find a definitive answer to this, but have been unable to do so."
Would your insurance policy not cover you if you are quarantined at a resort? Possibly a two thronged question insurance company / Resort
"I’m not sure if they would cover that, I guess I should call, it does say medical expenses are covered if I’m sick or injured but nothing about possible quarantine. Iv never had to utilize travel insurance before."
Yeah I agree I think that’s something to talk to your resort & insurance company about. I have insurance but it’s runs out just before we leave so I need to look into that. I will be contacting my resort too! I have heard however that if you do come in contact that symptoms do take on average 5 to 7 days to show so you properly wouldn’t get them until you get home if your there for a week
"Most recent FCO tweet...#Maldives - We advise against all but essential travel to Kuredu, Vilemendhu, Batalaa and Kuramathi Island Resorts, which have been placed under temporary quarantine. Contact your tour operator and insurance provider for further assistance."
"Alex S, you might travel there incubating it and become ill there?When contacting your insurance company, remember you may be looking at the cost of quarantine, possible healthcare, and reorganised flights. And possibly transfers? Also airport parking at home, extended pet kennelling etcEdited: 4:07 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Thank you for asking that question. Appears Travelex would cover if traveler became ill or was quarantined. So that’s great news!
That’s very true I could! I would say due to the nature of my job I am at Low risk toas I work outside and don’t come into contact with large groups of people daily. I will definitely look when I’m getting my new insurance. Is that Travelex in the UK?
"FCO now advising only essential travel allowed to Kuredu, Kuramathi, Bathala and Vilamendhoo."
Judging by FCO advice if we do want to travel it’s a case of hoping the resort we’re going to doesn’t get locked down if it does there’s no chance
"Alex S, yes except that some resorts will have sister resorts that they may offer you...you may get the opportunity to stay somewhere much nicer, you never know! Or, of course, less nice..."
"Also, if the resort can't host you, I don't think they'll be able to take your money (?), so you could always/or your agent could always book a different resort. If you wanted to still travel, you might get a good deal. The 'danger' being that you may find yourself in the same boat a day or so later. Babs, your equine has gone all feline..."
Well we’re staying at Centara Grand and there sister hotel is Ras Fushi which I’ve heard isn’t as nice so ya know haha! We have booked through Emirates holidays so I’ll get in touch with them and find out our options & I’ll check on new insurance and really that’s the least we can do!
"I’m meant to be going 24th March , not to the resorts affected though , my travel agent is keep us updated with the situation ."
"We are due to go to Kuramathi end of April.Wont contact the travel agent yet, pretty sure will be busy with people going in next couple of weeks.Wonder how far ahead they will look to postpone, cancel holidays though."
Bad News for Kuramathi https://en.sun.mv/58683Good news for Vila and O&ORRhttps://edition.mv/news/15429
we have 4 new cases in beijing all of which come from italy. they transited in middle east. I am not sure if there is contact tracing within the transit airportwe have implemented new regulation in beijing now. those not from epidemic countries will also subject to quarantine ， if you are local you stay at home with community surveillance which involves a livecam installed over your door or designated hotel only for 14 days.it looks like we are preparing for an global outbreak.
"Hi Alex, just wondered how the conversation with Emirate go? Last time i called they didn’t move an inch"
"Haven’t rung them yet! Am going to try them tomorrow! I’m hoping they at least give us the option to rebook if we want!Edited: 4:05 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I am curious what everyone thought process would be in this situation. It seems resorts will mostly charge massive amount to change/reschedule (even if airline waive the fee) and there is no guarantee that the situation will be over/better in a few months. It seems the decision would be to go now or not to go at all (rather than rescheduling)
"Minh, out of interest, what makes you think the resorts will mostly be unhelpful? I ask because this isn’t my experience..."
"Good point, i haven’t called the resort. I was booking through Emirates and all i got told was that they would charge 2k rebooking fee + any price differences. Would it make any difference or even feasible for me to contact the resort directly? Would love to hear everyone experience on that as well.To the original point (i know it comes with big assumption) but would there be any other rational options than to go and to cancel"
"If the agent won't do anything its always worth trying the ultimate supplier (Airline, Hotel). They usually can't refund you, since they won't have collected all the money. But they can be flexible, allowing you to use your nights/flight another time. Also if you can get the resort/airline to state they have no objection to you cancelling, you can then go back to the agent and have another crack armed with those emails.Obviously in this case the airline is the agent, so I guess you wont be able to get them to budge. But hopefully you can have some luck with the resort."
"It all depends i would say. First of all, my travel insurance is the only one in Switzerland who covers for the time being. But, both resorts we are booked at let us wait and decide till the end if we wanna travel or not. Also we have flights booked with Qatar leaving from Milan, that means we can re-schedule or cancel for free.Sorry to say but i always disliked Emirates.So we now hope we will be able to travel in June, but not looking good tbh"
"The Maldives government has just lifted the temporary restrictive measure of the complete island lockdown on Kuredu, Bathala and Kuramathi. High risk or suspected cases will be contained to one area and cordoned off from other guests. Kind regards, Jason"
"Jason, on those islands? Not taken to the quarantine facility?"
If Emirates holidays don’t offer me to rebook with no charge with what’s going on I think that’s a bit of a joke really given the current situation. I know Emirates as an airline are waiving there change fee. It’s not going to be long till no one can travel anywhere at this rate by how it’s going.
"Alex SI'm in a similar situation (for Mauritius).Turkish Airlines cancelled our flight and put us on an earlier one. Which means we'll have to take our daughter out of school early. Fortunately that means I can cancel for a refund. Otherwise they wouldn't have allowed me to cancel for a refund.Voyage Prive have offered credit/date change to anyone booked where FCO advice says you can't travel. And I understand many hotels/resorts are offering customers flexibility on their dates. But my destination isn't covered by that.My insurance (Barclays) provider covers me if FCO declares one should not travel. If you still choose to go, they will still cover you (I wouldn't in that case). Most insurers would not cover you for travelling against FCO advice. Their comprehensive cover is why I choose them.But ultimately, you're rarely covered for disinclination to travel. It leaves agents/insurers wide open to abuse in normal circumstances. I appreciate these arent normal circumstance. But given the FCO haven't advised against travel to my destination, I'm not sure I can really have the hump with my insurer, booking agent or airline. They may seem like faceless businesses, but ultimately they have staff to pay and investors (who are often us through our pensions) to consider as well.In the gran scheme of things I really don't feel hard done by. Losing some disposable income if I elect not to travel pales into insignificance compared to whats happening in Italy and what will happen to those in poorer countries who may not be able to put food on the table/keep a roof over their heads due to the impact of this.Edited: 5:25 am, March 12, 2020 "
Given the recent circumstances travelling may not be the wisest thing to do. But here’s what you need to know if you're planning on travelling to the Maldives.https:/…https:/…Hope this helps answer your question :)
I completely get where you coming from. Just very frustrating in the circumstances that they aren’t being more flexible. I may add I am yet to ring them and see what they say. It’s not that we don’t want to go we do it’s just we want to know if we can rebook later in the year.
"Just a thought...(a bit embryonic but we could pad it out) if one had a cough and was due to catch a plane to the Maldives, I think one would probably be advised not to travel...and then it would not be disinclination to travel so travel insurance would kick in, unless Covid-19/pandemic was an exclusion on ones policy?I am not advocating calling NHS services BTW - this would be a terrible misuse of overstretched resources (in fact, I think this would be unforgiveable), but one might contact the airline on an open forum like Twitter or FB...this way they would be forced (surely?) to respond in that way or suffer outrage from other customers, and one would have a record of the conversation."
"Its always worth calling the agent and suppliers as per my previous post.Also if you are in a higher risk group (age, underlying health conditions), then its worth speaking to your GP and travel insurance. Your GP may be prepared to issue advice not to travel. And most insurers will consider things on a case by case basis. At the very least as a purely cold actuarial calculation, if you are at high risk from COVID-19 they may deem it makes sense to payout for cancelation rather then risk paying out for ICU care, repatriation or death.Good luck. I just keep reminding myself it's just a holiday. My wife's gone to work this morning in an outpatients clinic that will have >350 patients passing through and A&E across the hall :/ Yesterday they had a lock down because a GP referred a patient with COVID-19 to the clinic next door, god knows what the GP was thinking. Fortunately they got hold of the patient and told him not to leave his house under any circumstances. But for 15 minutes they were searching the clinics to make sure he hadn't turned up to the hospital."
"Or if all else fails, give your OH a push down the stairs :D"
Frusci - post 326Doctors will not necessarily give you a letter if you are fit to travel but at higher risk because of age or a medical condition. Hubbo ticks both boxes but we have been batting our heads against a brick wall to get such a letter. The surgery says that no doctor is allowed to declare a patient unfit to travel just because they have an increased susceptibility to infection. It seems downright irresponsible to me to tempt vulnerable people to go ahead and travel simply to avoid losing their money but that's how it is. Our holiday is not to the Maldives thank God so the cost is not extortionate but it still seems unfair that the tour operator has said that we cannot defer unless we have that letter. The insurance company will I'm pretty certain say the same.
"WidYou're right, not all GP's will do it. And I doubt any will give you an official not fit for travel letter that satisfies the terms of your insurance. But some will detail their advice based on your medical history/etc. Which could be useful in any conversation with your insurer.Perhaps some GP's are more compassionate/amenable, or maybe they just need the £30 :DGood luck with your holiday/cancelation attempts.Edited: 7:41 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Yes, had an appointment with GP for Asthma condition:GP: Yes, having asthma put you in a riskier position and it would be better not to travelPatient: Can you fill this form saying you advise me against travelGP: I can't advise you not to travel ????"
Thats like a Monty Python sketch :)
I look at it this way. If you are quarantined in an hotel for a fortnight or have to get hospital care in ICU then pay for your return flight that will be a lot more expensive than loosing a holiday booking.Plus you will have been ill and weak. We don't yet know if there is imunity once you've had it and recovered. That's one of the things I wish they'd concentrate on.I haven't been away for 4yrs due to ill health and a move. Not even a day trip further than 30miles! I had the Maldives in my sights as a reward. Hopefully the island life will keep it restricted by with staff coming and going I don't know.I really sympathise with those of you who have paid and don't know what happens next. But staying safe and keeping well is the most important. Then you can continue when it's over.Just doesn't stop feeling really grumpy though.
Leaving for Vakkaru Saturday - and can't wait. Life MUST go on
"We are currently on Maldives. If anyone has any option to return any money take it. We canceled trip for our 3 years old kid which was 1500 euros and they are returnig us 24 euros. We cancled it a 2 days prior our come. Also we must go to carantine once we are back. Situation here is very calm , on the airoports nobody is wearing masks etc. Just when reading latest updates it is stressful."
I have just spoken to emirates holidays and basically they said they can move our flights at no charge but as our hotel is non refundable and isn't currently affected we'd have to pay to book that again. The flights is something at least just doesn't help with the decision
"Post 33 - MoHadSeems hubb's consultant, his GP and yours are all reading from the same script. Makes no sense does it? There will be thousands of people in the same position. My cynical side wonders if it simply might be that the Powers That Be want all of us worried but sensible non-travellers to share the cost rather than have the insurance companies suffer huge losses.Edited: 9:29 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Alex SContact the Resort. If you can get an email from them saying they are prepared to let you change dates, then you can forward that to Emirates and ask WTH"
Yeah that's what i've done...emirates said they would if they got in writing from the resort that we could. So fingers crossed.
"AlexAs far as I am aware Emirates are only wavering the fee, if the booking was done in certain periodI am due to fly on Monday via Dubai, I wanted to cancel the Maldives holiday and flight, but keep the Dubai flights.I was losing all the holiday cost, plus they wanted £250 each to keep the Dubai flights."
I have managed to negotiate the resort and amend the dates. I was meant to travel on 16 march along with 3 yo and 7 yo . My younger one is already having cold so can not take risk of being lock down or get infected. Had to cancel the flight and got half of the money back . I wont regret as i want my family to be safe.
Excursions from islands now suspended according to Maldives government on Twitter
So it seems we are allowed to travel to the Seychelles ATM. Hope we can leave by tomorrow and certainly would not worry to head to the Maldives now! Michaela from Reisser Travel
What does this mean - no water sport activities on all islands ?
@sagar t means no excursions to local (inhabited) Islands. Water sports will be fine
"Hi Bopal, do you mind sharing which dates you have moved to? and why is that a better alternative vs your original plan? I am just curious as i am considering this option myself but i can not get my head around moving to a different date"
We are due to travel on 13/4. The only thing I have changed so far is booking a transit hotel at CMB as it seems Sri Lanka have stopped tourist Visa. Unfortunately everywhere is susceptible so we are playing it day by day. Only positive I have heard is that the virus does not like heat
"AussieAnge, have you seen anything that suggests they have demonstrated the heat sensitivity please? I know it has been expressed as a potential (a much desired potential!), but have been keeping an eye out for someone demonstrating that it is actually the case."
"Nothing scientific, just what I have been told by people who should know. Perhaps that explains the quick transfer in Europe and America"
"Thanks Ange, I shall continue to keep my eyes peeled :)"
There was some news that at I think 26/27 the virus starts to die will see if I can find it.
"Thanks 66BJF, much appreciated :)"
"Thanks for the update.I have one day in Male (23 March) and other 3 days in Centara ras fushi (24-27)Should I travel or look for another dates ?Please advice as I am concerned on this virus now.

"WRT those changing their dates, I'd check how this effects your insurance coverage. You want to make sure it doesn't count as a new booking and if it does that there arent any exclusions introduced for new bookings WRT COVID-19. It's one of the reasons I haven't cancelled my flight and booked a new one with better timings. From my insurers policy and FAQ I believe I'm covered unless I book after the FCO advises against travel. But haven't had that conversation yet, so sitting on my current flight booking.We all hope this goes away as quickly as it came. But the WHO didn't declare the H1N1 pandemic to be over until a year later. And that was partly because 2 vaccines were developed, helping to speed up heard immunity.

Hi. I have not given them a specific date as my agent dealt with this. I believe it would be 6 months to a year. They should b able to amend . Its not a big deal for them . Be safe and travrl later
Hello minh. I will b travelling from india . As a new policy i would have to b in quarantine if i travel outside the country. Plus our govt has announced that if you cancel or postpone it there would b no extra charges. I am travelling with young children so decided to be safe and qt home and travel later . May b next year this time .
Placitasgirl....thanks for the clarification. That is what I had read and understood so I was concerned at jiiimse stating that a State of Emergency had been declared
Just picked up this about a new case today:https://edition.mv/news/15473Anyone else noticed it?
Hi i read your messages. Im from India. My parents have booked their travel to maldives via mmt for the 25 th of this month. Can you please guide me as the mmt people are denying all refund.
"@66BJF No, it’s not true that the virus dies at 26/27 degrees, the WHO emphasizes that we don’t know this and there is a lot of fake info out there so please don’t spread anything unless it’s from your country’s government etc or from WHO. There are plenty of news articles saying that you only should listen to official channels, here is a link to the second largest newspaper in Sweden that addresses this challenge and also the fake news about 26/27 degrees. https:/…"
"anyone have any idea how we need to proceed, we are due to fly to The Maldives via Sri Lanka with a stop over each side in Colombo on 01/04 and then 18/04 Sri Lanka has just stopped offering Visa on Arrival so I don't know whether we need to:Try and join up the flights (one is business paid for via third party and shorter leg is an award via Qatar but both on Sri Lankan) but very short transit and not enough time to collect luggage and then check in again.Stay in Colombo Transit Hotel airside but do I need a transit visa flight arrives 13.30 day 1 - leaves day 2 at 09.30Apply for a Transit visa that will allow a 48 hr stay but how do you do then arrange a second transit visa for the return as you can only have one running at a time.Anyone have any ideas, as I can't get any answers and am going round in circles!"
"@Resefamijen thanks for clarifying as I said in my post I had read this but haven't had any time to look back and check the source hence I had not added any further information and definitely don't want to spread fake news, we leave that for the politicians :)"
"I would think the safest option would be to stay in the airside transit hotel for the overnight layover. Even if you can get a transit visa, with things moving so fast you don't know what will happen in a couple of weeks. And rapid changes like this leave a lot of scope for confusion. The Indian sub continent can be a slow moving bureaucracy at the best of times :/For the shorter layover I'd be chasing SL to try and link the flights. Not always easy to do. But i've always found when you checkin for the first leg they are always happy to check your bags through. I appreciate in the current circumstances that may make for a nervous run up to the holiday.Good luck."
"Sri Lanka seems to have very little virus at present, so can understand why they are doing this to try and keep it that way, we only have 2.5 layover airside here thankfully, but can’t be sure where ever you are"
I have in writing from my resort that we can amend our booking up until September this year but it must be done at least a week before we travel so basically that means we have till next Wednesday to decide what to do so not long haha.
probly we are going to have a break in beijing. more and more imported cases through airport everydaythe newest development is this American chinese family showed all symptoms in the US and got refused for covid 19 testing three times， the whole family fly back to beijing with high fever just for the free treatment which costs up to 100k usd per person local price！
Glad you managed it Alex - probably next tough decision is when to :)

"Captain, leave alone the cost of testing etc, were the other countries decided the testing covered by the state and took quick action earlier and quicker, some of those back to Beijing with a very clear symptom might not want to risk to spread it to others on the way...I have colleagues rushing flying back to Asia from their home countries now...they are terrified and felt Asia is safer...Some countries kept doing the opposite of their neighbours, which is not respecting efforts of other countries... including those doctors still fighting in Hospitals in Italy...if we can’t work out the solution globally, then thé efforts of nearby countries can be easily wasted due to no banning of travelling from ‘ herd immunity’I am in shock after calculating the numbers of death, with the official estimate — 60% of the population will catch it and 3% among them is going to die ...If a country realised 5k to 10k of their citizens have been infected and no tests are needed,,, and still no banning their citizens’ international travelling due to potential infected people, makes it look really bad... it sounds they don’t mind to let people run around globally and spread it over. After so many hours I am still shocked to hear the plan of ‘ herd immunity’ and it’s clearly opposite to so many other parts of the world’s, including those took early action and restricted their own citizens international travelling without being asked by other countries... gosh.. can’t imagine how many who have infected will enter Maldives too... without the transparent number of infected citizens, it’s hard for Maldives gov to decide the ban. I think Beijing is still safer than Maldives in your case...Edited: 12:17 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Interestingly, departing guests today flying to Istanbul via Oman were not allowed to board at MLE as they “had not been in the Maldives at least 14 days”. They’d been here a week on a COVID- free resort . No suggestion of illness. This was the airline’s decision . Not sure which airline and which leg of the journey was the issue although I think it was being (not) allowed to land in Istanbul that was the sticking point.Their nationality is Italian. I wonder if that is the issue here.Edited: 7:36 am, March 14, 2020 "
"I believe there is general consensus among the scientific community herd immunity is required. The debate is the how and when it should be achieved.The efforts to slow the spread of the virus are not in the hope we can prevent large swathes of the population having to deal with this virus at some point. They are to spread it out in order to prevent health services becoming overwhelmed. And in the hope a vaccine can be found. H1N1 is still around to this day. But through a combination of infection and vaccine, herd immunity prevents another outbreak. The WHO didn't declare the H1N1 pandemic to be over until the following year and that was because we were fortunate enough to find a vaccine and no resistant mutations appeared.Ten years on people are still studying the H1N1 outbreak and refining the modelling. It will likely form the lifes work of respected mathematicians and epidemiologists. The same will be true of this outbreak. We likely won't know what the right approach was for years. Let's not count our chickens before they've hatched. If no vaccine is found it could well be back with a vengeance once distancing measures are reduced. Of course we all hope that isn't the case.Edited: 7:45 am, March 14, 2020 "
@Sunflowersblthe NO1 power in the world is definitely under reporting the cases big time， unless the family coming to beijjng for treatment is telling a lie. there doesnt seem to be any coordinations between the countries， instead ， it feels as if they are kicking the ball forwards and backwards. I dont understand the reason behind the western approach at all. let nature take its course？ survival of the fittest？after 2 months hard efforts in lock down， we now have to face the influx of the returned . there are one million Chinese in LA alone . if a small percentage of overseas Chinese（those without china passports） returns， there will be easily another epidemic in Beijing. since there is no way to quarantine that many of ppl in hotels when there are 100k foreigner coming into beijjng everyday. without quarantine， in a city of 30 million which is more than the population of the entire Australia. the city will fall， if the capital falls， china will fall.the atmosphere in beijing is getting tense with the new development， we were talking about back to normall life which now seem to be not happening for sometimecitizens are voicing for cancelling flights to maintain life over saving facethe newest rule is any passenger of international flights must be quarantined for 14 days at designated place. if things get worse， there will likely be cancelling flights

"Herd immunity is an important shield against any virus. Why do you think we spend so much time and money on the vaccination programmes like MMR? Because usually Virus don't just disappear.In the absence of a vaccine, there are only two ways this pandemic will end and future COVID-19 pandemics prevented. Either COVID-19 will miraculously disappear (H1N1 is still around, Measles is still around despite mass worldwide vaccination programmes, etc, etc, etc). Or we will achieve herd immunity through infection.Edited: 8:13 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Another example which may help you understand.MERS first appeared 8 years ago. We still don't have effective counter measures although a vaccine trial was started last year in KSA.

"Captain, yes that’s a very big concern. But I thought Trump had suspended a lot of flights between the States and mainland China? I wasn’t aware they are still operating.— but you know this matter far better, I have faith in you!p.s. my colleagues who rushed back to Asian were foreign expats with resident rights due to their working permits in Asia, not ABC or BBC etc...Besides, its interesting to see people kept comparing H1N1 to covid-19. Frankly Sars from 17 years ago didn’t make a real return was also true. And neither Sars or Covid-19 is that kind of a flu... why shall we compare apples with oranges?I forgot to say,hm, ‘ whilst I am sure Boris will never reveal weather anyone has done the maths on pensions and NHS savings if a large percentage of elderly in this outbreak but I would bet Dominic Cummings has urged this research...’ — now I tend to believe the rumour from ‘ the Sun’ saying the gov is preparing the body bags is for real ...I guess people would avoid Hyde Park for a while...

the reality regardless the cause is to let the old suffer the consequence.the US elder home has said enough. 15+% death ratealso herd immunity is a big gamble， what if the virus mutates into a more deadly formif the country does succeed ， then it will be a big threat to those。countries who didnt
"Some people have clearly missed their calling :)Who needs an electron microscope, genetic mapping, PHD and years of experience in epidemiology/bioligy/virology. When people at home can figure out which virus's in the Corona family are classified as apples and which are classified as oranges :)We all look forward to the home made vaccine that I'm certain will follow in days."
@Sunflowersblpension and healthcare have always been a big problem in an aging economy . there is simplely no solution apart from leaving it for the future to deal with. until now， there comes the covid 19. to be honest I am very suprised to see how the west deal with this matter. all the values the west portray seems to be sugar coated. for example the grand princess where only american ，Canadian， British are allowed to be unloaded from the ship， and the herd immunity approach and the policy in italy that ICUs are left for the younger ppl who are more worth saving than the old
"Captain, yes, can’t agree more... double standards as always, I guess..."
in the US， Dr fauci who is the president advisor on covid19， said clearly many times vaccines are one to one and half year at least down the road. in a few months when tipping point is reached， there will be no coming back， totally irreversible.
"""the policy in italy that ICUs are left for the younger ppl who are more worth saving than the old""It's called triage and is a well founded medical practice. It is not based on age, but on chances of survival when there aren't enough Doctors/Nurses/Equipment to treat everyone.A little less hubris and little more compassion for the Doctors in Italy making these very very difficult decisions would be appropriate. You never know when/if it might happen in your own country."
"Captain, wow, I just read many from 105, 90+ and 80+ years old have been discharged from not only ICU but fully healed in HuBei, wow, well done! Great news! I hope the world will recover from this covid-19 and everyone will be happily travelling shortly! Even the TA ceo Steve Kaufer is sending msg re covid-19... I hope this matter will not lead to a lack of fund for TA then the website close down... Hope those who are worrying or suffering will get through this soon!"
"yes many bad values happened in China，I am well aware of that.It seems that the wuhan story keep copying itself in an exact manner over the world.

@SunflowersblI honestly think this time， the world is screwed. from it first started， I got a hunch that its a big thing
"Captain, it’s bad only if it’s handled badly... looking at the bright side the pension fund and nhs will ( purposely) benefit from this... alas feeling sad for the innocent people who had their faith decided by the gov who runs them already... being told only have 4 weeks or so of lives in this world is no fun at all... gosh, they must be counting down the days, feeling really sorry for those :( yes even they are only 3% of the population any live matters!Meanwhile:You are going to learn more about your government and your society in the next few months than you learned in the last couple of decades.Edited: 12:18 am, March 15, 2020 "
herd immunity is one of the most talked about topic at home， its really shocking when it comes to peoples reaction. the world is filled with conspiracies nowadays. the oil talk between opec and Russia which apparently went sour， was it in fact staged and aimed at shale industry in the US？the herd immunity policy which apparently is contributed to the lack of other viable means to deal with the virus. was it in fact the perfect excuse/inaction to cull the older population for financial reasons. I think now we are standing at a time frame where new history will be made， a lot of things will be changing in the next couple of months. like 1918， 1930 If things go really wild， I wouldnt be suprised
"""was it in fact the perfect excuse/inaction to cull the older population for financial reasons.""Wow, just wow :O"
seriously herd immunity has lot of wild implications， unless everyone practice the same， take the maldives for example， will it allow entry to vast number of ppl with virus？ its either you are or you are not in. the world will be divided instead of globalization
"This forum is not the place to be having this type of discussion. This thread should be for information to help people with their travel plans, not to air conspiracy theories, alarmist views and spread opinions rather than facts.

That is an official news in en.sun.mv
Well what I’m hoping Minh is that the UK or maldives don’t let us go that’s means we get a refund and they rebook fully for early next year but otherwise I have no clue what to do right now! Just taking it day by day
When is your travel date?
We travel on the 24th March! Things are literally changing everyday right now!
Now Maldives government has announced that all hotel in Male mainland will not be accepting international travellers from 15th to 29th March 2020. That may be a good reason to request for deferment until further notice.

I don’t think that will help us as we won’t be using a Male mainland hotel during our stay due to our flight arrival and return time not requiring it! I’m just going to play it by ear really all we can do.
Just try luck. It may help. You would never know.
"I'm watching this thread closely, I myself am due to fly next week from London. Flying with BA direct.Not staying at Male either, unsure how this will all pan out."
"Things are changing hourly , not daily, Personally i couldnt bear to be counting the days to a possible fraught travel experience in 1 or 2 weeks , endlessly checking travel status, and , once there, agonising over return and what was happening back home. but each to their own , I guess"
"Unless the FCO advice for Maldives changes, the alternative is to lose your money. I'm guessing if you couldn't bare the worry, you're likely not going to simply say c'est la vie to losing ~£5-£20k either :/Edited: 12:53 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Exactly what I was going to say.
"BA are allowing customers to get vouchers though that's not really ideal either for me. Unsure if the resort will do much unless there's strict travel guidance by the Maldives government incoming from UK, even then nothing is guaranteed, nor via insurers if no FCO advisory.Have to see how it all goes, I've accepted that I may or may not go, would just save a huge amount of hassle having to claim everything back if not!"
I’m travelling on the 2nd April and like you all feeling concerned about getting stranded in Dubai or Maldives. Has anyone tried changing the dates with the resort? I have been told by travel agent that as it’s less than 3 weeks full cancellation will apply!
"lisa t, I haven't been following this thread (can't keep up) but IMO that may be really naughty of the TA. Now it may be that this is the agreement they have with the resort, they can't get out of it, and therefore they are (arguably quite rightly) passing the cost on to the customer...or it might not. The resort I have booked directly agreed without even a hint of a quibble to refund me my deposit if I would like to cancel due to covid-19."
"@Lisa T we are in a similar situation travelling out 01/04 plan was to overnight in Colombo but now that's looking as an issue so we are trying to discuss the flights with Sri Lankan but struggling to get any answers.I asked our agent about the resort just in case and their reply is below:but pretty much every change we're making for customers who have had their travel interrupted has needed to be handled on a case by case basis anyway. Whilst the resorts aren't giving refunds for cancellations if there hasn't been a travel ban, they've mostly been very helpful with making changes due to flight schedules changing and so on"
"Lisa tI am due to fly Monday night via Dubai, tried cancelling resort but would not get refund, Emirates wanted £250 to allow me to use Dubai flights only, and we would just go to Dubai to stay with my daughter.Today TA has now said resort will allow me to postpone holiday until October, and Emirates will now only charge £25Was then going ahead with Dubai visit, but have now seen that UAE are not issuing visitor visas as from Tuesday 17th. So now only option is to try and get earlier flight on Monday.Not good, but others a lot worse"
"I had just reached Maldives Centara Grand this noon.Male Airport is not crowded.Took about 5 mins to clear the custom as just happened to a new counter was opened.Took about 1.5 hrs waiting for the airplane.At the resort, it's not crowded here.In fact, felt much safer than in my country.The only stress part is on the plane.Maldives is so relaxing. I don't feel like going home."
"Iam just going to repost to the this coronavirus thread as it is relevant to people booked at the many Crown & Champna Resorts.I see ALL crown & Champna resorts have relaxed their cancellation policy. This may help people with bookings until 30th April 2020.Here is the link if it works …crownandchamparesorts.com/covid19-outbreak-…Crown & Champa Resorts Travel Flexibility and Cancellation PolicyGuided by our purpose of care, we are temporarily adjusting our policies to allow for maximum flexibility to help you make the right decisions regarding travel at this time:• Upcoming confirmed future arrivals:Existing reservations made before March 14, 2020, for arrivals from March 15 through/including April 30, 2020 can be cancelled at no charge up to 24 hours before the scheduled arrival or re-booked with the same existing booking details up until September 30, 2020.• New reservations for future arrivals:New reservations between March 15 through/including April 30, 2020 can be cancelled at no charge up to 24 hours before the scheduled arrival or re-booked with the same existing booking details up until September 30, 2020."
"Thank you all for your insight and info. I also am watching this thread closely. We fly out of the US on March 25th flying through Qatar. We currently still plan to go unless it becomes restricted, definitely still a bit concerned of getting stuck somewhere but also really looking forward to our second attempt at a honeymoon, the timing is so rough. Fingers crossed!!"
Any chance you could keep me updated with how things are at Centara Grand please Leo? We are supposed to arrive there in 10 days so any updates would be really helpful. Also where did you fly out of & through? We’re your flights busy?
"We are suppose to leave 7th April, but last night we found out that the state we live in is on the Maldives travel ban. :("
Sorry to hear about your state being banned :(Would be great if you could keep in touch letting me know how it goes in regards to getting a refund from your resort as a result of not being able to go due to their government bans.

"Matt Hancock (UK Health Secretary) announced this morning within a few weeks over 70's will be told to self isolate at home. Once that starts they envisage it will last for 3-4 months :/ They will be making arrangements for grocery & medication delivery.I guess that means any of you that fit into that age group will have to cancel holidays. Even if you want to travel I suspect it will affect your travel insurance.Good chance it will also end our holiday plans. My Dad just fits into that age group. Whilst we have a lot of close family nearby and the government is planning to make arrangements to support them during isolation, I'm not sure i'd be comfortable leaving them for 2 weeks whilst in isolation. Just in case they need something, I'd worry they'd be more likely to head to the shops if I wasn't here to drop it off (at the door)."
"Hi Alex S,I flew out from Singapore Changi Airport. The flight was about 80-90% full.Here at Centara Grand occupancy rate is about 70-80% full.The excursion tour we went these days are not very packed.Whole resort is quite empty actually.It's only when it's breakfast and dinner time we will see more people.So far, we have enjoyed ourselves.Only thing is dread of going back home back on a plane again.We are only here for 4D3N, I feel it's not enough.If you need to know anything more, feel free to let me know."
"Further to a message from Shangri La in Colombo where we planned to transit please see below:Flights to Sri Lanka from the United Kingdom, Norway and Belgium have been suspended from tomorrow (16), the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said. The Civil Aviation Authority said that the ban will be in effect for two weeks."
66BJFThats not good news :(
"Nope, we are due to fly 01/04 so fall just the other side of this, the worst part is that it is still not clear after the 30th whether it will be allowed to travel or not, I fear the latter but in a state of limbo now."
I guess if they cancel the flight you could find an alternative.I've been keeping an eye on alternative routes in case our flight is cancelled.
That is an option but pricing is nearly double and I wonder if you did rebook and then suddenly the doors were closed on entering The Maldives whetherinsurance would get funny or not
The latter is a concern. I'd definitely check with your insurer. If my flights get cancelled i'll give them a call before booking anything else.
"Well, you may find a way to get there but how about getting back a week or two later when things are changing daily. I normally spend Easter in Thailand and the area I go to has a high proportion of Australian visitors. The Australian government has just announced an enforced two week isolation period for anyone landing in Australia from today! I’m normally a keep calm and carry on sort of person but this is serious and I’m staying at home"
"Just as an add on to 08kate02 said about Australia. Sadly all the deaths here from the virus are from people who have come back from overseas with it in full bloom. I think way over 90% of the current cases are from people who have come back from places that have high rates of infections and have infected others. Tom Hanks comes to mind, and our government border chief who returned from the USA with it. That's what's driving the closure to outsiders coming into the country. 14 days is a long time if you're having to pay for it yourself. It's not cheap here for accommodation and food, plus some necessities are very hard to get. The panic buying is getting out of control. Even our state government has started working with the local supermarkets to have opening hours only for the elderly with no other people allowed in as the crazy rush every morning is sometimes like a stampede."
"To clarify, it’s an enforced two week isolation period for anyone landing on an international flight, including Australians. I was on the Thailand forum for the area I often go to and lots of Australians had been hesitating about going, then were hey so glad we did and now OMG! I’m staying at home. It’s not crazy here. People are buying stuff like loo rolls? I’ve stocked up with wine, Bacardi and pink gin."
"I hope light / no symptom passengers will not bring the virus into Maldives due to their home country decided not to offer them the test ( due to lack of testing kits apparently.) ‘The UK government - Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson - claim they are following the science. But it’s not true. The evidence is clear. We need urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies. the government is playing roulette with public. This is an major error.’ - Richard Horton. ( google him if you don’t have a clue.) and that’s not the only comment he made. I just hope Maldives government will take this matter seriously and reconsider who can enter Maldives. It might as well ease the mind of many forum members’ if they are actually being banned from travelling. Or even nicer if their home country issued a tighter travelling rule, by following the global solution. This is a global matter and one country’s policy will decide other country’s faith too - in this case Maldives’s ."
"I thought Oz is doing great as always, well at least compare to some others in the world. quick action taken at an early stage. Meanwhile, for toilet rolls, wow, I was laughing about this ‘ crisis ‘ with my Italian bestie a month ago when Hong Kong first fighting for it, laughing about how silly people looked, then we soon moved to the next page of not only people in Oz but also Europe and States are fighting for it...shocking, history repeats itself and so do mistakes I suppose. ‘You are going to learn more about your government and your society in the next few months than you learned in the last couple of decades.’"
"I think you'll find COVID-19 has already reached the Maldives :/If anyones wondering he's the editor of the Lancet. longstanding medical journalist and qualified Doctor. Respected and honoured in the field of Public health.But he's not infallible. He published Dr. Andrew Wakefield's paper “Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children"". Then was heavily criticised for taking a long time to take action when it became clear the work had been discredited and there were questions about Dr Wakefield's impartiality.Chriss Witty is also a respected Dr and epidemiologist. Whilst he may well be wrong in his judgement on this, I find it hard to believe he's playing Russian Roulette with the lives of 70m people. We'll find out in 3-4 years what were likely the best choices and even then only within a certain confidence level. Until then I'm sure every keyboard warrior will quote whoever suits them and act as though they know with absolute certainty what should be done :)"
"Well, the latest public opinion polls support the UK government’s handling of this. I’m with them, and only time will tell. I’m doing as I’m told which is a first ever. They are now saying the over 70’s won’t be allowed out at all. I’m mid sixties but I’m sure I can look a lot older with my woolly hat etc. I think I need to apply makeup before I go out. Or take my passport with me! You have to laugh!"

"I know it’s early days and don’t get me wrong I do feel for all the people effected by this or who have lost loved ones butSwine influenza or pig flu was one of the fastest-spreading and most fatal viruses in recent history. Originally seen in Mexico in 2009, it quickly spread across the world. According to the health sources, an estimated 20% of the global population contracted the illness (1360000000). Although the exact death toll was unknown, according to the data, up to 575,000 people died around the world due to the virus.You can’t really look at the % of deaths with corona at the minute as it’s not a true reflection and you won’t know until it’s over withBut if you ask me the the biggest epidemic right now is mass panic and hysteria from people the news and social mediaAnd last year there were over 1600 loved ones lost to seasonal influenza and over 26000 the year before and that’s just in the UKSorry and for the people who are panic buying in the UK YOUR NOT HELPINGEdited: 12:43 am, March 16, 2020 "
I do worry every time I see comparisons still being made between seasonal flu and this evil new nasty. I do agree about the panic buying however. It's self fulfilling. No need to stock up until there's so little left that next time stocks are replenished one feels the need to! I haven't so far but wonder whether I will if this keeps up. Hubbo is going to be incarcerated for months in a very short time and will rely on me for supplies. If I get ill then what?
Can you give some context as to why you worry about comparisons and why seasonal flu is any different?

"I agree, it is concerning when people try to compare this with flu or other stuff. Normally people with absolutely no medical background so ignore ignore ignore. This is different and it needs to be treated seriously. As for panic buying, really? I live in the midlands, and yes there was a run on loo rolls and pasta but everything is normal now. I bought antibacterial soap the other day, no problem. My eldest daughter lives in London and says home deliveries are back to normal. There will always be a response to new information but give it a few days and it always settles down."

Low enough that it won’t burn itself out, but significantly higher then flu. Hence if we saw similar rates of infection a lot more people would die then flu.- In certain demographics (60+, those with other health conditions) a high rate of severe illness. Hence it’s managed to overwhelm Lombardys ICU wards. There’s concern the mortality rate would increase if infection isn’t controlled. I’m not an epidemiologist, but do have a discrete math background. So appreciate why they are worried.The models could of course be wrong. They rely on the metrics fed into them. And when there’s an epidemic the reporting isn’t always accurate. It took them years to estimate how many people H1N1 killed. And even a year after that Pandemic started the WHO was reticent you declare it over.Here’s hoping it’s not as bad as they fear :).Edited: 12:21 am, March 16, 2020 "
"PaulnHelen, yeh! I do understand your frustration, I really do. So much conflicting advice and only you can decide to go or not. However, things are changing daily and for the only time I can remember, and I’m old, it’s not can I get there but can I get back. I was surprised at Australia closing. Europe is gradually closing it’s borders. It’s unknown territory. I’m staying at home, my daughters the same, their decision, not influenced by me. This is serious. Weirdly I was flicking through stuff to watch and came across the film Contagion, eight years ago. They were saying self isolating, social isolating, wash hands, wash hands the most important thing. So, have we learnt anything since that film was made in 2011?"
"Frusci, I think the WHO declaring it is now a pandemic was a seriously bad move. What was the point in that, it’s obvious that it would create a panic. Ridiculous."
"This is a travel forum, please keep your personal ‘expert scientific’ views to yourselves and post helpful travel related views/experiences."
"dottyday, you are right. Let’s ignore everything that’s going on in the world. There is no virus. Australia hasn’t shut its borders. The whole of Europe is open for business. Sri Lanka is open for business. It’s all blue skies and no one need worry about how to get where and how to get back. Eutopia!!! Just popping to the fridge to top the wine up, I’ll be with you in a jiff"
"Dear all,I am back to Europe with Qatar today, after 10 amazing days in Maldives. Everything went well. It's so sad knowing those places with less tourits this perios. I hope this pandemy will end soon, otherwise countries like Maldives will be seriously impacted."
I am just saying that this forum is about travel to the Maldives. Clearly there is serious stuff going on in the rest of the world so please stop being flippant. I look at news feeds to be informed about the rest of the world I don't expect to see it on the Maldives specific travel forum.
"Agreed, Mandy. I made a similar point the other day."
Why have nearly 3 pages of posts been removed? I have come here to catch up with info as my trip is planned for the beginning of May and all the latest posts are gone.

Sorry If this is native but anyone know how big the concern is for not being able to get back into your own country. I would expect your own country would allow you back even if you’ve traveled if your healthy? Thank you"
why 3 pages are removed？ because too sensitive. whats the point of this thread to users if you cant talk about the cause and potentially damage to keep user well informed？attacking the policy is not the same as attacking the country. there are tons of opposite voices even within the countrykeep the travellers blind or let them judge for themselves？good luck to those paying up 2000usd a ticket yesterday， the pics with Qs up to 6 hours at the airports. I wish nobody coughed
"I hope light / no symptom passengers will not bring the virus into Maldives further and make the current situation in Maldives worse due to their home country decided not to offer them the test ( due to lack of testing kits apparently.) — the Maldivian health care system can’t really deal with it! ‘The UK government - Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson - claim they are following the science. But it’s not true. The evidence is clear. We need urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies. the government is playing roulette with public. This is an major error.’ - Richard Horton. That’s not the only comment he made. I just hope Maldives government will take this matter seriously and reconsider who can enter Maldives. It might as well ease the mind of many forum members’ if they are actually being banned from travelling. Or even nicer if their home country issued a tighter travelling rule, by following the global solution. This is a global matter and one country’s policy will decide other country’s fate too - in this case all the none- tested covid-19 infected travellers who are coming to Maldives’s. It’s understandable some country don’t mind a 3% death rate with more than 1million deaths, however it’s unfair to let other countries such as Maldives to suffer the same without local Maldivian’s permission! Italian’s citent death rate is over 7%, guess who will follow next? We don’t have a problem with whatever route you choose, it’s ok you decided a different route with your own citizens and it’s your own choice, but do the world a favor by closing your own border and use your own people as guinea pig pls, at least those 55% in the poll are happy about this and want to risk it, fine, do it with them... no choice for the other 45% then, poor them! Who think it’s unnecessary to test the light symptom infections clearly don’t mind innocent people ‘accidentally’ bring it everywhere around the world. Singapore has more and more imported cases now..."
"Hi @SandyM,I have previously posted about our trip which has been planed in December last year. In summary we had the flights as following:March 5th: Bucharest -> Milan -> MaldivesMarch 15th: Maldives -> Doha -> Bucharest We have bought Quatar return flight tickets as the March 15th italian flights have been cancelled. We have choosen Quatar because it was the shortest 2 legs flight with the shortest layover - even if it was more expensive than the others. We were delighted by the Quatar Airways experince (our first one), they are really PRO.We stayed in Maldives as following:4 nights on Maafushi local island5 nights on Paradise island resort, all inclusiveBoth were great experiences, we put them in the right order and for sure we'll be back in Maldives one day.We were prepared for the scenario of not going back home by constantly informing from the official sources. Actually the situation in Europe is currently worse than in Asia...I would recommend the following sources:- Maldives Health protect agency twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/hpa_mv- Local website: https://avas.mv/en (the english version is slower updated than the Dhivehi one) - Quatar airways Covid-19 updates: https:/…COVID-19-update.htmlAs far as I understood, they are not allowing anymore to stay on 2 islands in the next 14 days as they are limiting travels between maldivian islands for virus tracking reasons. You need to take that into consideration. They have also banned some national foreigners so I would expect some of the direct european flights will be cancelled soon, as the Alitalia situation was. Alitalia announced us about return flight cancellation on March 9th, 2 days after italian foreign nationals entering in Maldives official ban news.Even with this flight stress, it was a perfect vacation for us, I would do it again!"
"Taken from BBC news The number of coronavirus cases in the Maldives has risen to 13 after three more people tested positive on Monday.All of the confirmed cases are foreign citizens - either tourists or migrant workers.The country's government has already implemented entry restrictions on tourists arriving from Spain, Germany, France, Italy, South Korea, China and Bangladesh."
"I arrived Sunday and was quarantined at male airport for9 hours due to someone getting on the plane at Doha with symptoms who started heavily coughing after an hour into the flight. . No internal airline or hotel would accept anyone on the Qatar flight, finally at 2230pm We received a letter from the health minister saying everyone could carry on with their travels after those concerned were isolated. Word is he was a local who had traveled from. Spain as he was desperate to get back before lockdown. Bang out of order."
"The above will get daily news every day, this pandemic is just started, will take according to experts from 3 to 6 months. If people continues to travel, it will get even worse. Think about getting sick in Maldives that has limited medical system.We have canceled all travel, until this is over we will stay home."
"Mauritius just announced they will ban all arrivals from UK from Wed, so our next holiday is off. We were scheduled to travel next week :(Fortunately I have insurance cover.Edited: 4:01 am, March 16, 2020 "
"absolutely Mandy, i go on here to read info re Maldives and Coronavirus impact not just about coronavirus - i watch the news for that....."
"Frusci, that is a shame but at least you have insurance cover and hopefully at some point (goodness knows when) life will return to some normality and you can get to Mauritius then."
Glad your travel insurance covers cancellation. Our does not cover pandemics
at this point， although it is irrelevant to maldives， I would like to say its time to not only worry about incoming trips . people need to get prepared at home， once thing turn south， its fast and leave little time to prepareits funny that ppl are only interested if they can get on their trips but not what if return flight is cancelled which is happening a lot lately.there are lots of chinese stranded and only private plane can be arranged which costs 25k a seat， the atmosphere is many will take it even they are not richmany ppl in china including myself has lost money for incoming trips， in the light of this once in a life time outbreak， maybe you might just let it go for bad luck， especially you are 40+all the data west uses are from China ， asymptometic is 10% and 10% of the recovered comes with resurgence， and you lose 20% of lung function even you are recovered according to some research . I really dont understand why its portrayed so lightly in the westI am sure my post will be reported again
"Captain, yes all that and lung fibrosis. It’s a pity for some reason the media decided not to cover the full story of the covid-19...It’s understandable the chance of having lung fibrosis is very small, but it will be 100% affecting your future life in case it does happen to anyone of you...Edited: 5:27 am, March 16, 2020 "
"@ CaptainAhab (and others)The reason that your posts are being reported and removed is likely because they are not related to Maldives travel, which is the point of this forum.This thread (or one like it) could be very useful for people either considering travel to the Maldives, or who have current trips booked for the Maldives, but only if it remains on-topic. There are lots of very useful links that have been posted in this thread to official sources of information, and of official status updates for restrictions around travel from certain countries. Unfortunately though those are being lost among posts which are not relevant. Your opinion, my opinion, or any one else's opinion on how countries are dealing with the CV pandemic are not useful or relevant to this thread or forum, and so those posts will continue to be reported and likely removed."
"Well I've had an interesting morning :/Woke up to a text from a Mauritian friend with a link to the announcement.Coincidentally I had an appointment with the Travel Nurse for that very holiday. Was too late to cancel, so had to go anyway (plus advice could always change).Planted my bum in the GP waiting room and got a text from my wife. The consultant she'd been sharing a room with all last week has come down with symptoms and been sent for testing. Told the GP receptionist who consulted the Dr and instigated leper protocol (understandable).Walked to school and spoke to my daughters teacher at the door. She said the COVID-19 protocol didn't apply yet since even my wife's colleague hadn't been diagnosed yet. But then the headteacher walked past. And through an abundance of caution she asked me to go home and call 111. I understand her position, she'd probably be lynched by other parents if we have contracted it. But the school year will probably be over by the time 111 answer :)Fortunately my boss is a nice man (I work for myself) or the NHS would be losing two employees today."
@Stu_and_NickiI just found out they are back？relevant or not seems subjectiveI think what I wrote do help people to make the right decision for their travel by showing a complete pic of whats going on
"Yes paying the more expensive premiums all these years has finally come back to me.I figure i'm now going to be up on the Insurance company, which gives me a perverse happiness :)They will save the flight payout, because a schedule change means I can cancel that."
"disagree with stu-nick post , as ' helping 463 million plan holidays/sharing experience & opinions'........often includes vital current local information. I would think the fast changing situation we are all in was highly relevant , tried to avoid phrases that will ensure instant removal.. but over the years there have been many ' situations' not up for discussion , I recall when many regulars departed from this site"
maybe this thread should be deleted once and for all， since if the cause and consequence of corona is not related to maldives， why the thread name has anything to do maldives of beach and sea？if the corona virus is a relevant topic， how can you say cause and consequence are notshould that when you give people advice， the advice should come with the reason behind it？ otherwise its called dictatorship？
"""often includes vital current local information.""Does people who are at best selectively quoting certain professionals, at worst posting unfounded sensationalist hearsay constitute vital local information?I saw one post on another thread which went along the lines of:""Two people were sitting on a bus 4.5m apart, one was infected and he still gave it to the other person:.You don't need to be a virologist or epidemiologist to pick the holes out of that one LOL"
"Well some good news for now. False alarm with my wifes colleague, just a cold :)"
"recall that 2 months ago， there was this first thread about corona.one reply sticked for a week before I saw it： Chinese has a habit to spit on street which is dangerousit was there for a week before I complained andremoved itwas it relevant？@Stu_and_Nickinow it seems even a British policy cant be commented？ plz have a bigger heartEdited: 6:21 am, March 16, 2020 "
the 4.5 meter distancing infection is true its officialwell it could be lol for you but bear in mind the consequence is real. its not we have a Panic at home， then you will say cccp lies！then I will give it to you the same sentence， its not us to take the consequence.
"""one reply sticked for a week before I saw it： Chinese has a habit to spit on street which is dangerousit was there for a week before I complained and removed it""Was it just one post or was the thread filled with comments like that?Have a count back of the deleted posts in this thread. And how long it was before people started complaining. The thread has been derailed with at best selective quoting of those that favour your argument. At worst sensationalist rubbish akin to the post about Chinese you have highlighted.When you find a thread filled with people posting sensationalist comments as fact about the Chinese handling of this outbreak then come back and let us know. We'll all be happy to help you cull it as well."
"""the 4.5 meter distancing infection is true its official""Really, given the virus has an incubation period of 11-14 days how do they know that was the vector of transmission?"
because we have cams all over the place， every singal corner. we chase down every potential contact. lets say 2 individuals unrelated got infected， cant be traced， this is bad becos you cant find origin. then suddenly the third infection of the same area comes. you try to piece together ， make assumptions， how to back it up？ camsI know in the uk there are no cam
"Oh right and your cams can see a microscopic virus can they?Who was patient zero then? Who were patient 1, 2 & 3?Because surely if they were able to figure out the virus jumped 4.5m between two people sitting on a bus, they have figured out where the virus started."
I am no expert ， I am only telling you what I read and what makes sense.the most import is fact ，isnt it？we are clear now， apart from overseas imports， the whole country gives single digitsyou may say cccp is lying as an outsider. I can tell you that everyone in china feel safe the same way， with everything connected by devices， there is no way to censor all.if you still dont believe， think this way， if total lock down doesnt work. look at the people on Oxford street now and the measures your government takes. where is uk going？
"Really you're not an expert? From your posts I thought you must be a virologist or epidemiologist at least.You're right, the most important thing is facts. Official advice. Not the average lay person posting sensationalist hearsay. I'm sorry Captain, but the 4.5m story doesn't strike me as fact :) And nor does most of what has been posted here over the last week.I'm sure all these comments will be culled shortly. So I'll try and refrain from wasting my time."
I work in private equity. I retired at age of 30， I like the UK，I have almost all the queens rides even with matching colourI spent one third of my life in london， I gave up citizenship and went back to china
I dont take it personally， its just debate， seriously you guys are making a huge mistake. dont get me wrong，I want the west to be good ， we are all on the same line. the tots of not being to go aboard is killing me. I want this to be over soon， but it seems to stay for long
"Just my two cents...I'm 100% sure everyone in the world wants this to be over, not just yourself. As much as people appreciate your opinions/knowledge, I assumed this thread was more about Maldives itself and the effects Coronavirus may cause potential travellers going to Maldives. I myself came for information on an upcoming trip, I didn't come here to potentially become lectured about why I should or shouldn't go or given life lessons on the virus as a whole, as much as I do appreciate other's input, it wasn't fair for others to come in and question why people are still travelling etc, that decision lies upon the individual themselves, not strangers commenting or deciding for them whether they are in the wrong etc. It'll be much appreciated if this thread could go back to those who are planning on going to Maldives soon so we can all discuss that side of things."
doodalonApologies. Im off to try and get my money back :) Good luck to everyone else.
"@Frusci, No worries at all, sorry to hear your trip won't happen, though sounds like you've got good cover so hope all goes well with the refund! @all Thanks to all for all the advice/opinions, it's still helpful regardless."
strictly speaking， the corona virus thread is irrelevant in the first place. why its even here when there are numbers everywhere. some people want to know more thats why I wrote and and expanded a little bit.its not telling what people should do， instead its to share experienceif I say ： nah ， its nth ， just go ahead， there will be herd immunity eventually. is that what people want？
"The thread itself is not irrelevant, it's a thread about Maldives + Coronavirus, where as you are generalising the thread to be about Coronavirus around the world, which is fine, though perhaps take that approach on a thread that is Worldwide like: Air Travel forum threads (https:/…ShowForum-g1-i10702-Air_Travel.html), there's plenty of Coronavirus thread's there that you could potentially discuss in?I'm not dismissing your claims/opinions, just telling you where you could be sharing your opinions, so please stop becoming so offended with comments like ""if I say ： nah ， its nth ， just go ahead， there will be herd immunity eventually. is that what people want？""Also, my mention of others telling others what to do was not aimed at you either, so again, please do not take offence."

"I have never been offended on this forum actually， I like to debate to some extent， even in that thread where someone said chinese has a habit to spit， I wasnt offended either， what I was thinking was， why it is allowed for such a long time among other things not personal.given that experience， I try to be careful with words. I never thought attacking uk policy would get on peoples nerves I wrote it because even within the uk ， there are debates of this everywhere. so because I am notbrit I can not say anything bad about Britain even the policy?then the reply would be， no its because its irrelevant . then that raised another question, there areirrelevant things on this form all the time, there has always been related+plus some unrelated extension s. why mine was quoted as irrelevant?I just want to make the air clear that. I don't things personally I ama man of reasoning"

"Hi Captain, I don't feel anyone is questioning your knowledge or opinions, though if you don't understand that this thread is not about politics or what you feel is wrong or right on the decisions of the British Government, then I'm really not sure what to tell you. No one is trying to ""protect"" what the British politics are, which is what you are insinuating. No one is saying you're not able to criticise what the British Government are doing, but I don't understand why you feel you need to carry on, when others have asked the thread to go back onto topic....This is about Maldives + Coronavirus, not about what the British policies are.... Hope that makes more sense?"
"@woffers Wow, that's quite a list of alternative options that have also will bring bad news! That's certainly unlucky! I don't have a plan B, other than get my money back or re-arrange dates, though I'd rather not have to if at all possible..

Fingers crossed since we leave in just over a week!!! Thanks again so much for all the info!!"

Went back to double check the ABTA COVID-19 FAQ and it looks like its changed.It did say ABTA agents would offer an alternative, postponement or refund.

"@doodalonI get your point.

"I did wonder if ABTA would be in a position to honour that promise Frusci...these really are unprecedented times - sorry about your trip, I hope you have a smooth experience with your travel insurer. As for me, I'm currently in the Maldives in what feels like a weird bubble - the staff are all in total lockdown, none them are permitted to leave the island. Tourists are not permitted to travel between islands, only to and from Male. Not that you'd notice it though, life continues as normal, the sun is shining, the wine is flowing and we are all making merry. I had about a 2 min wait at immigration on the way in, and then was actually in a bit of a hurry to catch my domestic transfer - all very smooth and easy. I'm leaving tomorrow and do fear for what I am returning to though...Edited: 5:56 am, March 17, 2020 "
Glad your having a good time out there Miriam. Was waiting to hear how things were out there for you. We are still planning to go next Tuesday unless everything gets cancelled. I am nervous but I’m sure once I’m in the sun all will be good.
"Looks like ABTA may have shot their load too early and are now trying to backtrack :(Glad nothing has impacted your trip. Hope it continues and you have a safe return.I'm having to wait until the FCO update their advice and Voyage Prive get back to me before I can chase it up with my insurer. Oddly the FCO updated their page with a cyclone warming, but didn't add the travel ban :/Fortunately the airline made a schedule change last week, so that's opened the option to cancel the flight. I can see the option to cancel on under manage booking.Voyage Prive's help line is going to an announcement saying their lines are closed :( Hopefully they haven't gone under. I suspect their IVR isn't set up correctly and instead of saying no agents available it's saying lines are closed. So I've emailed them instead and await their reply.So far their policy has been to offer credit for destinations that have had bans/FCO advice not to travel. Unfortunately thats not much use to me. I'm pretty sure my wife won't be allowed any leave for some time now. Once this blows over they will have a huge backlog of patients to treat. Therefore I hope they will refund, but fortunately if they don't my Travel Insurance will definitely cover me. They released a useful FAQ which covered this eventuality.I still have 8 days before my scheduled departure day. So can afford to give Voyage Prive some time and the FCO to update their page. I feel for those that don't have that time and can't get through to anyone right now :("
I’m here right now and it’s just been announced. That the uk are banned from entry from 19th March.
"On well, I was due to fly 24th april. I suppose now I know for definite that I won't be. In fact won't be going anywhere"
I am sure it is so difficult. Qantas has a 5 hour wait time
Where have you heard that Travel T? I’ve seen nothing official yet and I follow the MPA twitter
Its awful that the FCO isn't updating its travel advice. They're just waiting for other countries to ban us. Totally contradicts what Boris is saying.
"...and no, I haven't heard that eitherTravelTDo you have a source?"
All local island guest houses closing to tourists:https:/…
"Miriam,It's not good they can't stay on top of bans and keep their site updated. They should have updated the Mauritius advice by now.But in general I'm not sure they are doing the wrong thing. I live in London, walking distance to a major shopping centre. It was relatively calm a few days ago. As soon as the tougher messaging started everything has taken a nosedive. One supermarket closed. People shouting and screaming in another because they don't want to wait. Shelves cleared. My wife's department has had patients turning up in masks and shouting they want to be pushed to the front of the queue. The perverse irony of shouting at clinicians who will spend all day in that clinic throughout this crisis clearly hasn't dawned on them.Worse still In my wife's department they had 24 bottles of hand gel. They now have 3 bottles left. That isn't patients taking them, they were in stock rooms, but trained staff that have lost their minds :(Unfortunately a significant portion of the population don't behave rationally. You don't want to light the fuse until you have to :(Best of luck to everyone. I hope those that have taken leave of their senses feel suitably embarrassed, but I suspect they wont :("

"Minh VUnfortunately it depends what cover you have. At the very least you need to have cancelation cover. Even then some policies cover pandemics, others it's a separate bolt and some don't offer such cover at all.I'm with Barclays, which is more expensive, but has extensive cover. I always figured it's best to have the most comprehensive cover if travelling to such far flung destinations. But I always expected to pay out higher premiums and never recoup anything. Bit strange being in a position where I'll be up on the insurance company for years :/Other avenues would be ABTA, the supplier directly (agent/airline/resort), Credit Card, etc.Good luck."

Still just a waiting game for us 44 days until we are suppose to be going. Advice and restrictions are changing by the hour never mind the day but we can’t cancel as the current 30 day restriction doesn’t go into our holiday
"Well at least I have been put out or my misery now. The not knowing was worse than the possibility of cancellation.It was literally ""once in a lifetime"" for us and something I had wanted to do for 30 yrs.In the scheme of things my disappointment is nothing. People will die and lose their livelihoods.That is what matters. Not a holiday."
@PaulnHelen same for us - our trip to Maldives and India is after the 30 days so we are a bit in limo. We can't cancel as we won't get any money back and the airline won't do anything yet. We fly on 6 May.
"woffers_wife - couldn't agree more. We felt the same when we made the decision two weeks ago not to go on our holiday which would have started tomorrow. (not Maldives... sadly? ... or fortunately, perhaps) The relief to have finally decided was immense even though we realised we would probably forfeit all the money. Today's FCO announcement on the very day we were going to formally cancel was very timely and is an unexpected bonus. I agree though that all talk of lost holidays, regrets and lost money seems shallow and wrong in the grand scheme of things."
"We made the call this weekend to cancel. Would have flown to Dubai on March 21, then Maldives March 27th. In the final analysis we decided that the stress of not knowing who would close borders and if we would get home, coupled with the more and more clear realization of the 'irresponsibility factor' of moving about and becoming asymptomatic vectors after coming home, was too great. The call to cancel was a relief.I should say that we have so far recouped almost all our money. From theatre events in London to airfares and even Hotels.com refunded all 7K of a 'non-refundable' booking, so do NOT give up hope.Be safe."
"MAY 2020, dont know how are things going to pan out as we are to travel in the last week of May 2020. Anyone else traving in the month of May 2020?"
"I'm due to travel at the end of May also. My balance is due in about 5 weeks or so. I'll probably cancel, at least I'll only lose £200 deposit, and see how things go. Might get to rebook it and save some money later in the year."
"@Roxy my holiday is at the end of June and the balance due in two weeks. My TA has offered to hold my deposit if I cancel so I can use it to rebook at a later date, so it may be worth asking if you can do that. I actually think they could have offered to push back the due date so I had longer to decide whether or not to cancel so I'm slightly underwhelmed by them but good to know I won't lose my money.Edited: 4:40 am, March 18, 2020 "
"I'm actually contemplating not cancelling and trying to reschedule for next easter.I'm having some moral qualms about taking my money back and stoking the financial fire that is about to come. Ultimately its disposable cash for me, otherwise I wouldn't have spent it on two weeks in the sun. At worst I miss out on a better deal which I suspect is quite likely. But if everyone takes their money back, thats going to have consequences for the employees of the airlines, hotels, insurance companies. Need to confirm with insurance they will still cover me. And my wife needs to check she can get holidays, which is going to be the most difficult bit :(Edited: 5:23 am, March 18, 2020 "
Maldives is high on Rain from June-Oct. Vilu Reef not re-scheduling later than Oct. If i cancel i lose my deposit. TA saying both his & property cancellation policy will be applied. we're in a soup.
"Heard today that Robinson Club is closed to guests, so glad we managed to get our holiday in. Do hope the staff are being looked after in some ways...."
Riu resort is now under monitoring:https:/…
"@LindyLouisa my partner and I are also due to travel the end of June to the Maldives and our balance is due in a few weeks. I was hopeful to be able to rebook it at a later date as so far have only paid the deposit. If you don't mind me asking, which tour operator are you flying with?TIA"
"@Jess our resort is booked with Simply Maldives, our flights are booked with Gulf Air via TravelTrolley. We've paid for the flights in full and paid a £600 deposit for the resort. Simply require the balance 12 weeks prior to travel, a bit earlier than some agencies unfortunately. We still want to go if we are permitted to do so but I'm reluctant to pay the £2k balance at this stage and then have to try and get it back via insurance. I'm thinking of asking if they'll move the balance due date back so we've got longer to see how the situation plays out. If not I will have to cancel the resort, hold on to the flights and rebook the resort if travel turns out to be possible. If we're not allowed to go the flights will be refunded anyway so I'm not too worried about that aspect."
"How do you know your flights will be refunded? (Is this part of your insurance policy)? I ask as we were due to fly on 5th April, flights also with Gulf Air booked through Travel Trolley and I have received nothing from them. I have tried to call day and night, emailed them and haven’t had so much as a polite email to say they are dealing with bookings in departure date order. There are many bad reviews on them on trust pilot since CV has been around and countries have stopped UK visitors travelling. I have spoken with my credit card company who said that they will only refund me if the company don’t offer an alternative or try to charge me more to book an alternative. With the situation looking as though it is around for a while I’d sooner have my money back and rebook when the world has gone back to “normal”!"
"@Lauren yes I've seen the same feedback, it's very worrying. As I'm not due to travel until the end of June I dont see the point in trying to cancel now, particularly as we fully intend to travel if it's possible. Plus, the chances are that if world travel is still not happening by then, the flight will be cancelled altogether which should put me in a stronger position to go through either my insurance or credit card if TravelTrolley refuse to cough up. I had an email from them yesterday saying that they were going to amend or refund in line with the airlines policy so we'll see. It's bought and paid for now so not much more I can do.I'd be tempted to tell your credit card company that you spoke to them on the phone and they did try to charge you more-they can't prove you didn't!Edited: 10:15 am, March 18, 2020 "
"We were due to travel on 3rd April but it now looks like all non-essential travel is advised against by the UK Government. Also, the Maldivian Government is restricting any travel movement into Male. Quote; The Government of Maldives has announced a ban on entry into Maldives of anyone who has left or transited the UK in the last 14 days, with effect from 11.59 pm local time (6.59 pm GMT) on 18 March. Like Maldivian nationals returning to Maldives from the UK, British Nationals with residency in Maldives and who have a Maldivian spouse will be admitted and placed into quarantine. This does not affect British Nationals already in Maldives who should follow the advice of local authorities.' To me this is a little ambiguous...Our travel agents cannot be reached as they are trying to repatriat everyone who is currently out there. As long as you have the security of the travel agent being ABTA registered you shouldn't have a problem getting a full refund. Well, I hope so cos we've paid our £7k already!"
I was also booked to leave yesterday but although the flights were still scheduled on the uk gov it said all hotels locked down and transfers cancelled for 30 days ?? Did you manage to get there ?

"We are at Sun Aqua Iru Veli now, but our problem is we are on Sri Lankan flights on the 27th, all these are postponed until the 25th but who knows what will happen then. I am happy ( and fortunate) enough to be able to buy ourselves out on an early flight. The resort was lovely here for the first few days, but all the staff have been laid off, one has said they have not been paid, we are having regular power cuts and limited dining venues which is understandable as less than 20 guests here and going down each day. The resort shuts on the 28th/29th, staff face difficulties in getting home , I think that’s why they have become disinterested. They don’t know what’s happening to them either, must feel for them a lot are lovely hard working people."
"Glad to see that Universal are giving staff 3 month's paid leave during the closures, although I will be interested to know if that is full pay or partial pay. Sadly it seems that other resorts are not being so generous as per the post above.Would be good to know which resorts are planning on looking after their staff and which are not, as personally I'd like to avoid those resorts in the future. Although I also suspect that those resorts are likely to be the ones most at risk of not existing in 6 months time anyway."
Here is the update from the FCO regarding the UK ban:https:/…
"Amilla will also be closing the resort for three months and will be paying the vast majority team to take leave. We will keep a core team on the island to complete some upgrade works and maintain and clean the resort. We do have some guests who are very happy to stay with limited services and guests. I believe that aver 40 resorts are looking to temporarily close. Maldivian regards, Jason"
"Thanks Jason, good to hear that you are looking after the staff!I heard from one of the staff on Kandolhu that they are getting full pay during the closure, and like Amilla they will be using the downtime to make some upgrades and carry out maintenance that they struggle to do when guests are there."
"Hi Stu and Nicki, That is correct and we trying to use this time as positively we can. So glad the team were so understanding. The Universal Resorts approach has been a great benchmark. Cheers, Jason"
Ellaidoo paying staff and using time for maintenance - same with other hotels in that chain. Worth us noting and trying to use Islands that have helped their staff rather than rewarding companies that didn't.

"Lyn, we should start a list with all closing resorts and all resorts (still) open for the next few months. I think that would help a lot of travellers and answer many upcoming questions..."
"Hi SR, thanks and just started the thread."
"Tonight at 6:30 I paid £1500 for 2 seats on flight from Abu Dhabi to Manchester due to leave at 02:30 tomorrow, At 7:30 I got an email saying flight was cancelled, and I would only get a refund voucher or credit towards a flight in the future.What a shocking service"
"That's really rotten. They already announced YESTERDAY that there wouldn't be any more departure from Abu Dhabi immediately. So that flight was always going to be cancelled. They should not have sold you the tickets. In Europe, it will have to be refunded. But since the ticket was bought in AB, I don't know what kind of rules they have in United Emirates regarding the cancellation policy."
"Jiiimse, that is absolutely shocking ☹️"
"jiimmsee, right now that is their standard cancellation email. They do not say anything about refund to anyone (even to passengers who are eligible for refunds). I guess it's understandable that airline tried to save as much money as possible but it was really unfair to you. Since airline does not tell you, you have to find out yourself whether they are obligated to refund you tickets that were purchased in Abu Dhabi."
"Do you think that all resorts will be closed up till end of June? Or some will remain open if situation will improve let""s say in a month."
I just wanted to give some credit where it is very much due. Lux North have been fantastic regarding moving our booking.We were due to fly out tomorrow.
"woffers_wife, that's good to hear. We are planning to visit them in August for our anniversary, so really hoping to be able to. However, in an unfortunate situation where the travel restrictions still prevail, really hope we will be able to reschedule our booking without too much hassle. Let's see in any case and hope for the best."
You would think by Aug all will be ok to travel. For us it would have to be October now. Fingers crossed.
"Yes we are planning to reschedule for October. They offered us a year, so we could have gone in March (2021) as we had originally planned.However, it is my 50th birthday on Saturday and the trip was solely for that.Therefore the date we go is now irrelevant, so we obviously want to go as soon as we can, bearing in mind the weather.They have told us that we will be able to move it again no problem, should this nightmare not be over by then.If anyone from Lux is reading this, can I just give a shout out for their colleague Jameel in reservations.He has been beyond brilliant and made this so much easier to deal with for us.If this is a sign of the service to come when we eventually DO get there, I will be seriously impressed."
"For those that are rescheduling, have you had to pay any extra for your new dates? My TA said that if I reschedule then I will have to pay extra in line with the current booking price for those dates."
"@ Wolfers_wifeWhile the new date may not be too important for you, do bear in mind that you probably paid a premium to travel in March (high season), so if you switch your booking to October (low season) you may want to see if you can manage to also get them to include some upgrades or even extra nights at the same cost."
"Thank you for all your kind advice.We got an incredible deal from Secret Escapes when we booked it which was literally several £1000's cheaper and included airfare, speedboat transfers and All inclusive package.I totally get your point about it being a cheaper time of year now, however we are still £1000's up even by going in October.One of the biggest disappointments for us was the fact that when this all had kicked off that we knew that we would never get a similar deal, therefore would never be able to afford their rates.This literally was a once in a lifetime thing, both in price and experience and having dreamt of this trip for 30 years and had done soooooo much research, really had our hearts set on this particular resort.We would be able to go elsewhere but we had looked forward to it for so long, since the resort first opened that we probably stupidly, would have felt that anywhere else was second best, if you see what I mean?The fact that they have honoured the offer, even though we are still quids in, speaks volumes in my book. Therefore, we feel we have no right or desire to ask for anything ""extra"", especially when this is a situation, totally out of anyone's control and many maldivians, indeed, all over the world people less fortunate than us will be suffering badly.We are more than happy (and were not expecting to be) to just get there and have the holiday we expected, as we hope everyone who is reading this does too, when we come out of the other side of this.And we will. Together."
"@LindyLouisaYes, we've already been informed by Baros that if we rebook for next April 2021, we will have to pay the higher rates. Currently I believe the April 2021 (after April 12th) rates for the Baros Villa are about $120/night more than what we paid this year. Plus the 23% I'm sure Vilamendhoo will be the same (more expensive next year).I estimated it'll cost us about $4,000 USD more to go next year with the extra fees/taxes on the award tickets (last year was $30 next year it'll be over $200 for the award ticket taxes).Things may change between now and then, but I think there will be enough pent up demand that the resorts can and will charge more than this year to make up for the losses.I could be wrong. Only time will tell."
The other thing that has become apparent and is affecting costs as you see them today is the dollar sterling rate so if you are looking at a price for 2021 in Sterling with the pound being so low it's artificially inflating the cost. We are probably moving Moofushi to 2021 but agreeing the dollar price until sterling hopefully corrects.
Is everyone happy to book now? Are we happy ATOL & insurance will cover us?Want to book but a bit worried as we already have a lot of stuff booked for this year.
"We've booked our flights for next March, but as they are with BA we are confident that they will still be in business and worst case will get credit towards another flight. We've also paid by credit card for the added protection that brings.Personally I would not be looking to actually book resorts at the moment due to the sheer amount of uncertainty. You have the question of when flights and bookings will even be possible, whether the resort, Travel Agent, or airline will still be in business, and also the awful GBP to USD exchange rate at the moment. We may also see some very good offers later in the year for 2021 bookings if expected occupancy rates are very low.Obviously if you can make a booking with zero or minimal deposit then there is very little risk, especially if that deposit is transferable to another resort or holiday. But make sure to pay by credit card and only spend what you can afford to lose would be my advice.There's nothing wrong with looking ahead at the moment and starting to plan for when life gets back to normal, and lord knows we could all do with something to look forward to, and a holiday is a great light at the end of the tunnel. Just don't make any large financial commitment and make sure that booking terms are flexible."
"I also hope by next year March , all are good !"
"USD is traditionally a safe haven currency, so not surprising GBP/USD has headed south.I earn in USD so monitor GBP/USD, when this all kicked off I held off changing my earnings. Having difficulty securing forward contracts though :(When this all calms down you'd expect to see the falls reverse. But you might have to wait until the markets/property have corrected a bit in the US. Then investors will be looking to snap up bargains elsewhere, which should push sterling back up.Unless of course the crap really hits the fan here, but in that case a holiday will be the least of our concerns :("
"This is exactly what my TA told me. If i reschedule,I'll have to pay according to rates set for that month. I booked for low season,May2020. Looking at months to come after May, i am not sure how rains will hurt our vacation,and for the high season starting Dec, the rates are just double. To add to it, airline fare difference. The resort washed it's hand saying they can't even comment on my booking since i booked thru a TA, felt like crime to me."

I am supposed to travel on 15 May how was your trip
"I have plane ticket for Maldives on june 13th 2020 for 16 nights. Do you think that resorts will have some last minute offers with very good prices to attract tirist to come back? As checking now, prices went up if compere to 1 months ago. Is there any web page, turiat agency that offer last minute deals for Maldives? As would not like to rush due to coronavirus."
"Also for June, better to contact the resorts direct and see if they give a special deal. But not make any money stuck booking yet. as you will book after the corona alarm, so might not be eligible for refund or cancel. Also many resorts are still closed your dates. And all is depending on the airline companies. So better to check closer to your travel date,"
"You could ask the resort and make sure in the booking condition that there is a free change of date without any fees. Purely from a personal perspective, I would probably look at a later date."

"Hi all, please can I see if I can get a bit of assistance...does anyone have a link to anything official that shows that the Maldives is closed for business, preferably with an 'at least until' date on it?I can't find anything official where it is written!Likewise, has anyone seen anything specific to Vakarufalhi showing the same thing? I know it is closed until 30th June, and can see that from their booking page, but need more for my chargeback/section 75 claim!Thanks all :)"
"@Maldiva, whilst I have read statements from the Maldives Minister of Tourism they have been those published in their local press. I did find the following issued by U.K. Government. Unfortunately there is no “ until” date merely “temporary suspension”of visas on arrival.https:/…coronavirus"
"MalDiva good morning, it is all depending on the international airline company's (those who are after cov still existing ;) ). When they start to operate on Maldives i am sure the Maldives as country will start functioning also (And the resorts opening). No need to open the resorts when no flights with guest can arrive."
"Hi Peter, MalDiva isn't asking when The Maldives will open again; seeking this information to assist with recovering funds for her cancelled holiday via a chargeback on her credit card as her resort has reneged on an agreement to refund her. This is frustrating as there must be many travellers who'll have to consider going down this route to recover funds due to them and who'll be asked for this very information. Good luck with the claim MalDiva."
"Thanks for clarifying Placitasgirl, I didn’t realise I’d been ambiguous in my question.You are quite correct. I know what the situation is, but actually proving it in order to enable my credit card company to do a charge back or to get them to cover it via a section 75 claim, in order to retrieve my money from the resort (Vakarufalhi) who agreed to a refund but then just put shoddy stalling tactics in place is proving a different matter. I eventually found something in the source code for some agents selling Vakarufalhi online and have submitted that. I am not too worried, TBH. The email chain alone is compelling and clearly demonstrates the situation. Although I suspect it is possible that I’ll be pushed back into resubmitting when the date has passed and the resort is still closed. Likewise for the flights. And failing that, my travel insurance should cover it.The forum is very quiet on the subject of people fighting for refunds etc..."
"Other then the likes of Universal it's rather strange the way the Maldives resorts are handling this. If you go on their websites there's not a mention of COVID-19, the resort being closed, etc. Essentially sticking their heads in the sand and hoping customers will go away. Quite amateurish given the size of these businesses in terms of revenue.They really aren't doing themselves any favours by following this approach. If they acknowledged whats going on, put up a thought out narrative, they could probably put off many claims. Instead they are forcing customers to file claims with card providers/etc now. And their silence just makes the claims more likely to succeed. Normally the card companies could put these claims off until the loss was crystallised. But if the provider isn't being forthcoming, then it makes it a much easier argument for the customer. It's akin to ordering something from Amazon and it not turning up. If Amazon said we'll investigate and send a replacement if needed, you'd be obliged to wait a reasonable amount of time. But if Amazon didn't respond at all, it's reasonable for you to conclude the product isn't turning up so you can file a claim."
"Oh and I have two S75 claims in for our Mauritius holiday (one for flight, one for hotel through Voyage Prive).Not heard anything back from the card company yet. But my insurer has already confirmed i'm covered and they are happy to wait for me to try a S75. So not chasing it. I dont envy anyone working for insurers, S75 depts or customer services in general right now. They are probably getting a lot of abuse and snowed under."
"I put the flights as consequential losses and the credit card company have - for now, anyway - agreed that it is acceptable to do it that way. I anticipate I may need to fight this, but let's see if they come up trumps...My insurers won't speak to anyone who isn't travelling (or not!) within 48 hours. perhaps I'll email them."
"My dates have already passed. We were due to go for Easter. So insurer was happy to discuss the claim as the loss has been incurred now.If you have dates in advance, then I guess many insurers will want to wait before accepting a claim. Even if its clear you wont be going, I guess it helps them to keep the money as long as possible.In your scenario I'm pretty certain the credit card will have to pay eventually. But it might be better for them to dispute the transaction now as they could claw it back.Edited: 6:45 am, April 22, 2020 "

Maldives is currently in scenario 3 which indicates that tourism industry is expected to reopen during the month of July.But things can change for another scenario depending on the evolution of the pandemic.https://raajje.mv/76236

As if we needed any more confusion or contradiction thrown into the mix! Surely with the current situation on MaleIt would be madness to permit entry to the country by July? Who nows.... all we can do is watch and wait.
"Yes, we have to watch and wait.For me I am hoping that they open tourism before September.Already canceled my April trip (we would be there now if it weren't for the corona virus) and I don't want to cancel the trip I already booked (in December) for next September.It would be too many vouchers for my taste."
has anybody got an actual refund from alpharooms
Lockdown on Male extended until at least 14th May:https:/…
"Hello everybody.Sorry for my bad English. We had scheduled, before the coronavirus outbreak, to visit Maldives at the 3rd of July (3 local islands, until 30/7). Today we called our travel agent to see our options and he said that we could go for a refund at this moment, but it looks like the flights will probably operate normally then (all the fuss is about the flights because we have booked accommodation from booking dot com with free cancellation until early June). He doesn't have much to gain from us to lie; the refund will be made from the Airlines (Saudia).I have read many threads in the forum and from what I have understood, almost everyone is stating the exact opposite from our travel agent, that there is no chance Maldives will be open for tourism in July. I read everyday about the situation at Male and the lockdown.We have decided that, if it is possible to travel, we will take our chances. But will it be possible? If anyone knowing the local situation, has any advice to give, it would be highly appreciated..."
"Hi erratic1983, I'm sorry but if the Maldivian government Ministers don't believe tourism can recommence safely until Q4 2020 (and this was stated before the current outbreak in Male City) then quite frankly I think your travel agent is ignorant at best and deluded at worst. As you say they have nothing to gain from telling you your trip will go ahead in June, but frankly I don't think that there's any way this will happen. The idea that you could be arriving at Velana International and staying at/travelling between 3 local islands before returning to the airport by then is so implausible it's hard to imagine how they think this could be possible. We're almost in May and In my opinion the ban on the issue of tourist visas, which means that no tourist can enter the county will continue for quite some time to come, certainly into and beyond your travel time. It's good to hear that your can claim refunds for your flights and have free cancellation on your accommodation. I hope you have a great trip when tourism resumes and you're able to travel safely."
"Just to add to Placitasgirl's post I think local Islands will probably open later for tourism than resort islands as the government wouldn't want to risk the local community who have less resources than tourist resort's and the local councils will levy the government as they will not be wanting to sacrifice lives against the tourist $$Edited: 12:46 pm, April 29, 2020 "
"erratic1983 Kalimera ;) Even Saudi not have flights available (published) for your travel dates https://www.saudia.com/ and even if there would be a chance to get to the Maldives. They will not allow the travel between Islands by then as Maldives is still on their way to their piek in the Corona cases. And then you have also the Visa story, as they will not allow just any Nationality arrive all at once. Also ""taken your chances"" hmmm if there is not a money issue, good you can. But sins you travel then after the outbreak you will be on your own when stuck, As for accommodation cost, evt care (if needed) and repatriation. Better to take your refunds and not lose out with late change of plans. And plan for after.... I parxi kalitera Maldives ........ meta ;) Stay safe"
