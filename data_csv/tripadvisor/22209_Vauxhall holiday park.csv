Is the park still open.due to the coronavirus
It’s best to phone the park and get the latest information
The Parkdean Resorts Twitter feed has information
Or parkdean Facebook page.
"It’s business as usual still, and I have driven past today and noticed the gates were wide open and the site was functioning. I would check the twitter feed daily though. Anything could happen tomorrow, they could shut down for economic or health reasons. The town is quiet but the site has its own mini economy ."
"All change today. The park is open but the restaurant, bar closed and entertainment and all activities ceased."
