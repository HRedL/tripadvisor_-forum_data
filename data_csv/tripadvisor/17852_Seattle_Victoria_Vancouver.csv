"Hi, I just booked flights last night to from DC>SEA and YVR>DC, am planning a 3.5 day / 5 night trip to the NW, and wanted to ask for itinerary and site-seeing suggestions/feedback: 7/31 = Arrive 7pm SEA for 2 nights @ W. 8/1 = Explore Seattle8/2 = Leave Seattle heading to Victoria for day trip and eventually Vancouver for 3 nights. Option # 1 = Seaplane 2x - Kennmore Air to Victoria 11am > noon flight. Harbour flight to Vancouver 6:20>6:55pm. Option # 2 = Ferry + Seaplane = Victoria Clipper 8:30am > 11:15am. Harbour flight to Vancouver 6:20>6:55pm. Option # 3 Seaplane to Vancouver afternoon of 8/2, spend 8/2 in Vancouver, take round trip ferry tour/daytrip from Vancouver>Victoria without luggage either 8/3 or 8/4. I see pros / cons in each of the 3 options and am leaning towards option # 1 since it'd allow us to sleep-in, grab leisurely breakfast in Seattle, and minimize travel/connections when traveling Victoria despite being more expensive. I could also take 8am>9am flight but that seems aggressive wake up call for vacation that would yield 3 extra hours in Victoria / Vancouver Island. Does the Victoria Clipper have great views of the Pudget Sound if we were to take ferry then seaplane to Vancouver? If not and this is a floating Amtrak, I imagine it being a boring 3 hours. Is Seattle>Victoria>Vancouver too much travel in one day and too difficult to store carry-on luggage in Victoria making option # 3 more viable? I know least about this option, and am thinking the transfers on both ends are to be avoided for only having a day in Victoria. In Victoria, I'd like to see Butchart Gardens whether permitting, downtown Victoria, and relax in some forest scenery area all without car if possible. I really wish I had more time to explore more remote locations of VI, but flights are already booked. 8/2 > 8/5 = 3 nights at Westin Grand Vancouver. The wife likes to sunbath so hoping for a nice 80 degree day she can catch some rays on the roof top pool, however plan to explore Vancouver and see the Capilano Suspension Bridge. Thanks in advance if anyone has any high level tips on my initial itinerary.Paul"
"<<Is Seattle>Victoria>Vancouver too much travel in one day>>IMO, yes, utterly ridiculous, although taking flights makes it a bit more reasonable. I know people do things like this, but if you are only going to spend a few hours, why go at all? Victoria is worth two days and Vancouver Island is worth 10 days. Vancouver with a daytrip to Whistler makes more sense to me.I haven't done the trip up from Seattle, but the trip between Tsawwassen and Swartz Bay is gorgeous.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj15HfDSnDw"
"I would investigate the ""jet pack"" option for your Seattle / Victoria / Vancouver leg. It might be the only way to do it. Just skip Victoria. Although it would be a shame to do so."
"Let's just look at the 5 nights and what will actually work2 nights Seattle3 nights Victoria - the Clipper or fly4 hours journey to Vancouver to fly out. There is an element of risk to be taking a ferry on the day of travel, but if you allow enough time, it should work out. Or.... fly from Vic airport to Vancouver airport to hook up with your flight out.OR2 nights Seattle3 nights Vancouver - maybe Amtrak Cascades which is a 4 hour scenic journey**Just the two destinations are tight trips and if you try to do all three you will have no real joy at all."
I think option 1 is fine. Yes it's a whirlwind but will give you a taste of Victoria. The flights will be quite scenic which will compensate for not having a ferry ride. I do think there are better options than Capilano however. Look at Lynn Canyon or even Grouse Mountain.Edit: typing while others posted..obviously I 'm the odd man out tonight. But I love small planes and see the Seattle Victoria Vancouver flights as part of the adventure. If you do go that way be sure to take a light carryon .You'll be able to precheck your bags with Harbor air when you get to Victoria leaving you free to catch a cab to Butcharts first thing. Spend a few hours then back to Inner Harbor for a stroll about .Edited: 7 years ago 
"thanks to everyone for the info and responses. I do realize this is trying to pack in a lot of info in a short trip, however vacation days are limited. it sounds as if flying Seattle>Victoria>Vancouver is the best option. I've added Lynn Canyon and Grouse Mountain to Vancouver day trip options.thanks again,Paul"
"t47 and tennisjazz, you're not the odd ones out. I also think that that flying from Seattle to Victoria and then on to Vancouver is not a bad option. Would everyone do this, no, but it's still feasible to me. If you can swing option #1, go for it."
"Option 1 is best. I would seriously consider the earlier flight so your are not so rushed in Victoria. If it is a hot sunny day, don't waste it on the hotel roof! Lovely beaches near Stanly park and Kitsilano Beach across the water from downtown."
"Thanks everyone for their Vancouver tips. We recently returned from our trip and had a blast, and we're definitely glad we were able to fit in a 6+ hour stop over in Victoria/Sooke. See our review for our 1st half of our trip if interested or anyone else is considering this itinerary:tripadvisor.com/â€¦52160773In Vancouver, we rented a car to see Capilano / Grouse Mtn our 1st day in Vancouver, which was overcast unfortunately so we didn't make the observation deck of the windmill. Our final day and a half in Vancouver were brilliantly sunny at mid-to-upper 70's so we had a great time exploring Gastown, Granville, and Stanley Park on bikes, which was our favorite activity. Looking back I wish we wouldn't trimmed down Gastown/Granville slightly and explored the park more. Thanks again.Paul"
"I'm glad you had a good time and the connections all worked for you. Now you can say ""We saw it all!"" Thanks for letting us kmow."

"Chiquita...tagging on to an old thread is always a bad idea. You get buried.Start your own thread.At first glance....you are trying to do WAY too much...and a lot of flying when there are other options.Flying harbour to harbour Vancouver / Victoria on a small Beaver aircraft is a stunning trip, but you are limited with luggage.Flying from Vancouver airport ot Victoria airport and all of the ground travel involved to get to each is complete waste of time for a few hours in VIctoria.Victoria is a one day / one night destination at a minimum.Flying to Port Angeles?IMO...you need to re-think the whole thing."

Don't hijack an old thread.Start your own thread.You always get better responses and better info when you do.I had suggestions....I listed them.I listed specifics.You didn't like what I had to say.Have a nice trip.Sorry your post was removed.Edited: 6 years ago 
"What is going on here? There seems to be an epidemic of huffy posters who take offense when they receive good advice. I was going to tell Chiquita the same thing as Datthecoast on the WA Forum, but I think I will refrain from doing so."
"NYE Hangovers?Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Funny how some bad questions, which lead to admittedly terse but fair responses leads to something that makes you wonder why on earth they asked us in the first place. If you didn't want our opinions, then why ask? Don't confuse TA with a travel agency.Edited: 6 years ago "
