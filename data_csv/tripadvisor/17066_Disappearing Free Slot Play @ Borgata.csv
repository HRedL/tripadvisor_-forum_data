My March mailer said I had free slot play 3/23-3/24. My Borgata Rewards account said the same thing online.I went to the Borgata Monday night (3/23) and logged in on a slot machine and it said I had $0 in free slot play. So I checked one of the kiosks and the 3/23-3/24 offer was gone.I've used my free play a few times in the past and this has never happened. Maybe it was a glitch? Anyone else have this problem recently? Have I just lost my mind?
I have had the same problem a few times but it was at the Taj Mahal.
It happens at CET from time to time as well. The case of the disappearing FP is an epidemic.
Hmm. It's weird because the free play for the end of March and all of April is/was still there.
"Did you take your card to the Promo counter and ask them to check it for you? That happened to me once and it turned out someone else had already downloaded my slot $$ (I knew the person, but didn't know they were going to do that)."
Good suggestion. No I didn't. It wasn't a lot of $$ and I was on my way to murmur so I didn't want to make a thing of it. I think the guest services desk was closed anyway. I might send an email to see. I'm the only one with a copy of my card/pin so it definitely wasn't used by anyone else.
guestofaguest- No need to send an email. I will look into it for you. Can you please private message me your account number?
