"As related to COVID-19, any thoughts (pro and con) on safari trip this July to Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia?"
"I somehow think this is a bait post of some kind - I've seen them pop up on various countries ....However, if its real...The chances of any USA tourists being allowed into overseas countries in just 2 months - are pretty much 0...The highest number of cases - and deaths - of any country in the world .... until that stops - you wont be going anywhere"
I am inclined to be pessimistic. I can't see Americans being allowed to visit Botswana until this fall in September or perhaps even in October.
