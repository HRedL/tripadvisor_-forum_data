"Hi everybody,I know this has been mentioned previously, but what is the current situation with Quarantine and Curfew times for the Over 65'sCheersMJC"

"Thank you for the link Caz. Face masks are mandatory and huge fines issued for those breaking the rules. Who are you supposed to be flying with Len? As there are no direct flights from the U.K. in July, and only very limited Turkish airline flights from Gatwick to Istanbul . And they aren’t for package holiday makers obviously."
Hi Josephine I'm sure he had a packsge with Jet2 to Dalyan Live Hotel.
In that case he won’t be going then. But how can he not be aware that there’s no flights...
Hi how do you know there are no flights for jet2 please? They are still saying from 15th July although I completely get this is doubtful.Thank you
"Easyjet have no flights July at all. Jet2 seem to be cancelling a few. I work with a Turkish health company and only health visitors can travel at present with Turkish airlines. They check their reason for flying, ie see their hospital form.Although I know of some who have flown as tourists at weekend and they weren't asked anything. Their travel insurance will be void of course, hope nothing happens to them!Let's hope there is an update from government next week re quarantine and flights etc"
"I wish you would post this info on the Marmaris forum Caz as people on there are in total denial in spite of the facts! There is so much information around now, l am at a loss as to how people can be so unaware of what’s going on."
"Has anyone heard that flying into and out of Turkey, no hand luggage is allowed?"
"Yes that appears to be the case, it’s just a laptop or a handbag. No big carry on baggage anymore ."
Caz I have posted that link till my fingers hurt and there are those that still don’t get it!!! Masks are mandatory in most provinces. If people fly for tourism as the U.K. government still advises against all but essential travel they have immediately invalidated their holiday insurance and not just just for Covid related incidents.......Just because flights in the near future are showing on websites etc and even being sold there is absolutely no guarantee they’ll go ahead. Having a ticket for early July is no guarantee you’ll be in the air.......
"Josephine I just posted in Marmaris forum with it.VIP family, it was more about health flights being allowed in rather than tourists. Up to them if they lose luggage, flight gets delayed, get sick etc and no insurance to claim on!Some people don't read or listen.same as no social distancing or wearing mask or staying home!"
"Pegasus also flying from Stansted via Istanbul, more flights becoming available. Also the possibility of buying travel insurance once you land ( providing 3 levels of cover dependent on price including cover for Covid 19) yes face masks are mandatory and curfew still in place for over 65s before 10.00 and after 20.00. Things are changing week by week here. More restaurants and bars are opening and more have decided to open after July 1st. Lots of rules and regulations in place to maintain hygiene and limit risk.Edited: 10:33 am, June 23, 2020 "

"Thanks Caz ... we will see if they are still in denial after that! Though nothing would surprise me in that direction. Thank you for posting latest developments MrsM. The opportunity to buy insurance that end... including Covid cover ... seems like a very good idea from the Turkish Govt, and cost can’t be any more than this end... the huge price hikes here are a joke."
I know about buying the Covid insurance on arrival but anything else will be invalidated by flying against official advice!! Insurance companies as we know do their best to get out of paying in “normal” times- I hate to see them handed a reason on a plate!!
Easyjet have flights from end of july to turkey now. Let's hope a good signUpdate by government next week re quarantine and possible airbridge etc.Just need WHO to change its advice.
It’s the U.K. FCO that still advise against all but essential travel overseas. Until that is changed anyone that travels from the U.K. risks invalidating their insurance ☹️
Interesting that you can buy insurance when you land. Does anybody know how much if costs and how easy it is to buy?
"€7000 euros cover isn't much at all, depending how long sick or in hospital and it wouldn't cover repatriation etc if needed.https://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/3759…"
"I really hope this does not become the white herring that it is, and people think they can solely rely on such insurance for everything and as Caz W rightly states 7,000 Euros really wont go far if you need medical treatment for Covid"
"After hearing Priti Patel saying this morning that it is probable that there is to be a localised lockdown here in Leicester, I am so pleased that I moved our flights to next Easter - not being able to go about your business here to fly out and still be restricted when we get there is just not worth the hassle. It's been a pretty miserable lockdown for us, so I am just going to write this year off and look forward to arriving in Dalyan next April when restrictions HOPEFULLY will be lifted. Stay safe everyone."
"I feel the same Blonde fox, having just got back to work & now the threat of another lockdown, it will be too much stress for me, I prefer to wait for next year,"
