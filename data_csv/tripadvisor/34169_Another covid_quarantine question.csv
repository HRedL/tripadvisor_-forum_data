"Hi all. I am soon traveling to St John, but I have overnight layovers in Puerto Rico on the way there and back. I've heard about the new requirement to have a negative covid-19 test within 72 hours of arrival. I am curious if this pertains to in-transit passengers who are only in Puerto Rico for a layover. If I book the night at the airport hotel, would I be exempt from this? I am very concerned about finding somewhere to test and get results back on St John within 72 hours of our layover in Puerto Rico. Thanks!"
We are yet to find information regarding passengers with layovers. This type of information has not been made available as of yet.
"Update - I received a response from the airport:""If you exit to the public area in the SJU Airport you require meet to the protocol:""So... that's not great."
If I were you I would try to overnight in Miami or fly in early and find a flight that’s close to when you land at SJU so you can travel to another gate to wait for your flight to STT
"Yeah, I'm looking at changing to layover in Miami instead but it's going to cost quite a bit. I'm mostly fine with that, but am worried that after we do that, then Florida is going to suddenly get their act together and require something similar! haha"
I really doubt Florida will implore anything of the sort they are really disorganized down there.When are you heading down? I will be traveling to STT too 7/24-7/31 after changing my plans to go to PR. I just can’t bother to deal with all this lol. I’ve been tested 3 times already for work and It’s always been negative and I’m over it.
"Traveling 7/10-7/20. This was actual our back-up trip already as well - Initially had plans to go to Iceland until they changed their mind on letting Americans in. Booked this trip on Friday, and now here we are. I knew it was a risk trying to plan a trip during a pandemic, but alas, I am desperate."
"is that all they said in their email? did they explain what they mean by ""public area"" in the airport? seems crazy they would bother testing and possibly quarantining (and keeping on the island) people who don't even want to stay on the island in the first place..."
"Yep. I followed up with a ""what if we stay at the Airport Hotel and don't leave?"" email, and he responded back ""Yes, is required."" and ""Same protocol.""I have also emailed the hotel just to see if their response is any different, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
"I would think that would be their standard response, you leave you must follow protocol. I’m in the same boat, will be returning home from STT through SJU 7/18 and may require an overnight stay. So when they say you need to quarantine, can you quarantine in the hotel for a night until you leave? I believe there are testing sites on the USVI so may be able to comply with the 72 hr test anyways."
I did find a site that offers Rapid COVID testing on the islands https://www.redhookfamilypractice.com/I would recommend finding out if this test is acceptable. For transit...
"If you are arriving prior to 7/15, you shouldn’t technically need one. We arrive 7/11 and still getting them done before we leave San Diego to err on side of caution. I don’t want them to somehow want us to get them once we arrive even though it’s before the 15th!"
My post above is for the antibody test and is not accepted...
"I heard back from the hotel and their response was different from the airport's:""Here at the San Juan Airport Hotel guests from US and internationally are entering and leaving normally, the property is inside the same building as the airport that you wouldn’t have to go outside. If you need further information please don’t hesitate to contact us."""
Brennaabroad - can you tell me what email address you are using to get answers? I am getting none.Thank you!
Airport - info @aerostarairports. comHotel - reservations @airporthotelpr. comIt did take several hours before I heard back from either.
I was worried about this too--but we only have a layover in SJU for 3 1/2 hours so won't be leaving the airport. That's a relief....
"Just received from SJU Passenger Services:If you don’t exit to the terminal and staying to secured area , you don’t need present The COVID Test.Q&A Executive Order 2020/06/30From July 15, any passenger travelling to Puerto Rico must bring a COVID-19 qualified SARS-CoV2 NEGATIVE MOLECULAR test with results no more than 72 hours in advance.1. I've done the Covid19 test before and it's come back negative, do I have to re-test?Yes, all passengers coming to Puerto Rico must submit evidence of a COVID 19 qualified SARS-CoV2 NEGATIVE MOLECULAR test with results no more than 72 hours before2. What's the new procedure when traveling to Puerto Rico?To enter Puerto Rico, you must submit a qualified SARS-CoV2 NEGATIVE MOLECULAR test with results no more than 72 hours before.3. If I don't take a test, can you do it to me at the airport?We recommend that you already bring the test from your place of origin with results no more than 72 hours before, because here at the airport the waiting time could be very long.4. Where do I submit my test form?In the next few days we will be informing and disseminating the form that you will have to fill, you will be able to find it in www.sjuinsider.com,at the moment, it is not yet available.5. How are you likely to be asking for the test if the test results take more than three days?The 72 hours results begin to count once you have your results with you not the day the test was done. 6. Do children also have to take the test?Yes, children must also take the test, the Executive Order states that it applies to all travelers, it doesn’t specify ages. 7. Does the 72 hours start when I get the test or after I get the results?The 72 hours start after I get the results of the test."
"Thank you Kara. That is very helpful information. Did you email SJU passenger services to get this information? Knowing that the test results and not the actual test within 72 hours is much easier to make happen.Edited: 4:11 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"So just to be on sure side. If my arrival there is 7/16, on what days prior should i get the test done? Would you take it on thursday or friday? To ensure results in our hands by tuesday/wed?"
"Depends on how long the tests are taking in your area. Here in NC it’s anywhere from 3-7 business days, so I’m going on Tuesday probably since I am also flying in on 7/16. We have an influx of testing recently so the labs are backed up here, but maybe not in RI. I would call a fastmed or your hospitals Covid-19 hotline and ask them.Edited: 5:57 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"Ty @brittany p for your suggestion. Much appreciated. I think I will follow suit with testing dates, just to give room for errors. So i hope. Have fun on the island once you're there :)"
"Copied and pasted from discoverpuerto.com... “What type of testing do I need to do prior my visit to Puerto Rico?Travelers need to take a molecular COVID-19 test, which consists of a nasal or throat swab, taken no more than 72 hours prior to their trip. Testing sites on the mainland U.S. can be found here.If I take the test a week before, would those results be accepted?No. Travelers need to take a molecular COVID-19 test, which consists of a nasal or throat swab, no more than 72 hours prior to their trip. Testing sites on the mainland U.S. can be found here.”The conflicting information is so frustrating. Does anyone have any updated info?"
"I arrived at SJU last evening late. The following is in place. They have tables with folks in EPP at the exits from the baggage area. They asked me my name, phone number, and flight number. They asked where was I going. I told them the City of Rio Grande. They did not ask for an address. They asked my age (a new one since college bar days- a very very long time ago). Asked for no ID. There was no temperature scan (which is being done in every bar and restaurant I have been to since). This was clearly a protocol for contact tracing, nothing more, but they have the set up to ask for COVID tests if the July 15th mandate goes through.They have also set up a large area at the baggage claim to ger a free, rapid COVID test. They say a 10-minute wait. It was totally voluntary. My best guess is that if they go through with the test mandate on the 15th is that if you don't have one they will send you there and ten minutes will be ????"
"I saw that earlier too. I'm wondering about this 'clause':If travelers arrive on the Island without the requested documentation, they will be offered a rapid COVID-19 test at the airport (which consists of a finger prick blood test). Even if the rapid test result is negative, it will be mandatory for the traveler to quarantine and cover their own medical expenses/possible extended stay as rapid COVID-19 tests can sometimes yield false results. The quarantine is mandated until the traveler provides proof of a negative molecular test result on Island. A list of testing sites in Puerto Rico will be available on-site and online. If a negative molecular test is not provided, the traveler will be required to quarantine for 14 days, or the length of their stay..... So does this mean as long as we can show proof once our results come back from our test sites...we will be taken off quarantine..if it even goes that far?"
so is this consensus that we don't need to show any test if we are only stopping in puerto rico for a short layover?
