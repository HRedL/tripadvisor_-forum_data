"I’ve become addicted to watching this now:https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaFrance and Malta both added on this week at rates around 34 and 84 - not sure quite what’s driving decision making given the disparate rates, but I’ve read somewhere that countries are going on a watch list at 20, and going back onto Quarantine list if continuing to increase. By that logic Croatia is at real risk of going back on in the next week or two. We are hoping to travel in less than 12 days - if anyone has any insight into what the trigger point is I would love to know!!"
Thanks that’s really interesting (although disappointing and upsetting!!)
"Laura, don't become obsessed with numbers and news. As I wrote in some other topic, if you need vacation badly, and if unfortunate decision happens and your government implements mandatory quarantine on return from Croatia, and if you can of course allow yourself to be isolated for such time period, do come and have a wonderful time. :) These uncertain times will last for universe knows how long. Actually, who knows if it will ever end and will we ever travel again as we used to. Lastly, these numbers you see increasing are mostly young people clubbing."
"Slight correction to #5, there’s no PCR test involved. It’s just a 14 day self-quarantine if you have no symptoms.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-c…Edited: 4:23 am, August 15, 2020 "
"Personally I am not too worried - I feel I am at no more risk of catching it in Croatia than I would from taking a trip in the uk. Even the thought of the situation changing whilst abroad and having to quarantine on return is a nuisance but workable. But having the fco guidance change prior to travelling invalidates insurance which is more of a concern. If it was just me I would probably go for it anyway, especially as this feels like a prime time to visit without the cruise ships. But with 12 days to go, I personally feel it looks like the guidance will change prior to our departure so a much trickier decision to be made, more due to bureaucracy than actual personal concern about the virus."
I understand. I do hope you'll decide to come and have a blast. :)
Even if British tourists still wanted to go the airlines would withdraw flights and the insurance companies would withdraw cover.
"We have same concerns - we are due to travel on Thursday and cannot go if we are required to quarantine (kids school). A lot is riding on the next few days rates and we will most likely have to make a last minute decision. Found a site (flyer talk forums) that has been pretty accurate so far re France, Malta etc based on rate of increase infections, they produce daily charts comparing countries etc worth checking out"
I am also due to travel to Croatia in the next 10 days and due to being a teacher in the UK I will be unable to travel if they introduce the 2 week quarantine rule so I am watching the cases very closely. They have released today’s case at +162 which is less than yesterday. Fingers crossed it carries on going down!
"Same here, we're travelling from Edinburgh on Aug 29, yesterday was last day to change our flights free however my husband wants to hold off and hope we can get there. If it changes while we're there it'll mean two weeks for us both unpaid, however it changes before we go we won't be insured."
News clip here in USA today showing the situation in Europe in general...Croatia was mentioned due to so many young people holidaying there...clearly no distancing or masks in the clubs and beaches and rates going up....it seems that there may be a general EU rethinking of these open borders soon?
"Well, gene, you know how the news channels work - they tend to select the most extreme stuff - I have spent a few weeks traveling around Croatia and I felt much safer as far as social distancing is concerned than I do in my local supermarket. The night clubs can now stay open only until midnight in Croatia because they were indeed a source of some of the cases but of course there is no need to go to a nightclub in the current situation - as one of our chief epidemiologists tweeted from his vacation in Croatia."
"Plus look at Australia - they sealed their borders and still, there are quite a few cases in the Melbourne area.Edited: 10:44 am, August 15, 2020 "
"Only reasonable questions about corona - how much people with it in hospitals and how much dead. How long sect of Witnesses of Testing Counters will rule?!? How long?!?Edited: 4:52 pm, August 15, 2020 "
I think we can safely say there will be no holiday now. Gutted.
Yes I think tomorrow it will be added to the ‘red list’. So disappointing! We were due out on Monday...
"@GeorgieT we're due to go Aug 29, gutted, think tomorrow will be a bad day"
So sad and frustrating...especially because there are regions at the coast with almost no infected...
We are still considering going - and accepting a certain degree of risk. As long as flights continue.
"@Laura W, if it's all but essential travel your insurance won't cover you. We'd love to go as Cavtat and dubrovnik probably safer than the UK"
We’ve spoken to our insurer and the only thing that isn’t covered is hotel and flight extra costs due to COVID. We are willing to take a chance on that as would probably cost us more to reschedule. Medical expenses and routine travel insurance bits are still covered.
"I just read all of this....Have posted myself.I would like to book my airline and hotels/airbnbs tomorrow and Friday. Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik and an Island of two..Planning to come around Sept. 18- Oct 7.Advice? When it seems to change daily...I am coming from US. Too big of a risk.....wish someone would know.Trying to use the VIPER app to talk to people over there.I already had tours cancelled this summer including to Croatia and Dalmatian coast....took 3 months to get all my money back.I am not wanting to wait until next year....its so depressing when you plan a trip...mine was the trip of a lifetime that included Italy and Poland....Slovenia and Bosnia....I also do not think that this virus is going away, it is so insidious..."
"@Laura, good that you spoke to your insurer but i would seek that in writing because that seems to be in contrast to vast majority of insurers. Why in a medical pandemic would they offer you cover to travel on your holidays? Doesnt sound likely to me."
Decent summary of what is likely to happen. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/au…
"Yeah, we can see it coming..."
I still hope for all you girls and guys that you'll decide to come regardless of the eventual quarantine or having to take the tests. It's borderline insane how this whole thing is blowned out of proportions. Media is bombarding us with numbers like the end of the world is behind the corner.
If it goes on the red list unfortunately we will be cancelling / rebooking to somewhere elae. I can’t work from home so self isolating for 2 weeks on my return would be a big no no. Gutted!

It's a desperately sad situation and I feel frustrated that so many countries opened their nightclubs and are now paying the price for it. Easyjet pulling out of Southend and kiboshing my flights this week was a blessing in disguise really as we've at least been able to change the destination country.We'd have been willing to do quarantine but like others have said it's insurance implications and sudden lack of demand for the flights to fly. Our country doesn't seem too keen to let people take the quarantine option and seems to do everything in it's power to force people straight back home when it happens.
"@Jools1979, it's a horrible situation especially when dubrovnik area very good. Where have you changed to?"
"Hello SwilsonWe've switched to Sicily ad easyjet fly there from Luton. Intense 2 week countdown now to see if we get there. We had a lovely Pula and Rovinj trip planned and again not areas with much covid going on. I feel so sad for Croatia, we fell in love with the country on previous visits to Split and Dubrovnik."
"Hi All, I've been visiting in laws for past few days so not on line very much. To recap I'm due to fly EDI - DBK this Saturday with Easyjet. I too expect the decision for Cratia to be added to Quarantine list tonight but I'm going anyway! I'm going solo though as my OH work will not permit him to fly if a quarantine is in place at the time of departure, I can WFH. I realise the FCO advice will render insurance invalid but I'm taking the risk, I go away normally 4 to 5 times a year and have never had reason to claim yet. I've also been watching for cancellations of the flights, for instance to France that went quarantine last week...they will continue to fly I expect for at least 2 more weeks, as they have an obligation to bring home anyone they have flown out there already, I'm assuming they would prefer to fly outbound with some paying passengers than none, so I expect the flight to go ahed on Saturday. We paid so little my husband is happy to miss out financially and holiday wise to allow me a week away.I have very little faith that by October any international travel will be permitted. I don't expect any of these countries to come OFF the list before a better system is put in place, probably with trials in the winter when demand is lower, and with hard lobbying from the airlines / tour operators during the winter. I'm not going to try again until at least Easter and the worse of the flue season is over with. On the plus side I did see that Easyjet are allowing fee free changes for French flights once the quarantine was imposed. the issue is, as I've just found, because people are squeezing onto less and less destinations the prices are ridiculous. Good luck all! But I've made my mind up, if the flight is going then I'm on it."
"I wish you the best of luck Liz, possibly have a back up plan - we've changed country for our upcoming trip because our flights got cancelled. I will warn that when easyjet cancel flights they axe the outbound straight away and let the inbound continue a bit longer to get everyone back. We would have still trued to get there too but easyjet took matters out of our hands when they pulled out of Southend Airport."
Daily cases have just been published. Unfortunately up again +250
"Hello all,I'm due to fly to Croatia by the end of August and on my return trip I will fly to London Gatwick and stay in the UK for 3 days before flying back to Portugal.Will this probable ""red listing"" of Croatia cause me any problems? I will stay at a friend's house in Hove during this period.Thank you in advance.Regards,Mário"
Is anyone still planning to travel? Due out Sunday for week and can WFH so no issue isolating when back
255 unfortunately.
"Hi MarioInteresting question. Whoever lives in your friends household will likely have to quarantine as a result of you staying there if Croatia is on the quarantine list so that's the first thing you need to think about - the impact on your friend and anyone living with them.Portugal may want proof of where you've been and when do to speak especially if they are just about to go back on the green list. I'd avoid the UK if you can.Edited: 8:20 am, August 20, 2020 "
"@41 and @44""Someone in my household has returned to the UK, do I also need to self-isolate?No. Entire households will not be required to self-isolate if someone has returned from overseas – only those who have recently arrived in the UK.If any members of a household experience Covid-19 symptoms, however, everyone in the household should self-isolate.""From https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/coronavirus-quar…"
"@jools my outbound for 6am Saturday is still live but i know they could cancel right up to Saturday morning. Its only a weekly service from EDI so the next flight they could get me home on is the one im already booked on a week later.Also @mario, im going to go to Croatia and checked if that affected my husband on my return as he can't WFH so is not travelling with me. He DOES NOT need to quarantine when i go back unless i get a positive test, or get symptoms so as it stands i think you can go to UK after Croatia, you must quarantine but noone else in the house needs to unless you or they test positive or show symptoms."
@Andrew yes I'm going as long as the flight is still going. Also preparing to WFH for 2 weeks after and decided its worth it.
"Hey all,First of all thanks for you replies.My friend is already working remotely and he can stay that way for as long as necessary so luckily there will be little to no impact having me there for a few days.My question was more about exiting airport, using the train and so on. I will obviously not want to endanger anyone so I will stay at home permanently other than taking a train from and to the airport.Thank you once again :)Regards,Mário"
"Yes you are allowed time to travel on public transport from the airport. If you are a resident you are also allowed to go to a supermarket to make sure you have food in the house. The rules make no sense if they are truly trying to isolate all imported cases. To do it properly you should be escorted directly to a designated quarantine hotel, but anyway this is what they have decided..."
"Bear in mind working remotely isn't the only restriction, you are talking about not being able to leave the home at all, not for good shopping or fur family or anything - it's not something I'd volunteer to do for anyone else or ask anyone to do for me. If the rules state they don't need a test then fair enough but that just shows how farcicle this all is as the point of quarantine is that the virus can be symptom less and you may not know you've got it or know you need to take a test.It's all a bit ridiculous for everyone to follow really!"
"Hi SwilsonIf the FCO change advice it will invalidate insurance unfortunately. That's the thing with this quarantine thing, you get the choice kind of taken away from you by the FCO. Naples is nice, I had a good trip there, good base for exploring."
"@swilson @jools yep no insurance but beyond caring. And yep rules are a farce, i have to stay in but OH can happily go shopping/ to work still even though he's in close proximity daily to me.The other thing i know is that they are nit even gathering details from all returning passengers. I know someone who returned this week from Lanzarote. They said around 1 in 10 passengers were asked to fill in the covid tracing form, and they may follow up 10% of that. I don't intend to break any rules but you can see why people are...I expected forms to be handed out on the plane to every passenger and handed in at border or something."
"Blimey that's interesting hear Liz, yes I thought it'd be like everyone filling out a landing card on the plane.But yes we'd be doing exactly what you're doing if our flights weren't cancelled. Just bought a slightly bigger cabin case for 10 days in Sicily - hopefully I'm not wishful thinking, 14 sleeps and counting!"
If anyone is looking for a head start the socials are suggesting Croatia on the list but Portugal off. Start research now ready to press the button once it gets announced later tonight
https://twitter.com/grantshappsThere you have it folks. Confirmed.
Really sorry for those affected - especially those in the tourist business
Really sorry for everyone out there disappointed and for the Croatian tourism industry. We got married out there 5 years ago on Monday (hence our planned trip) and it honestly is the most beautiful place I’ve ever visited.
"Well that's our trip 3-8 Sep to Dubrovnik cancelled then... So gutted to have had this booked since Feb and cancelled with only 2 weeks to go! This was after already having the return BA flight cancelled and then booking an easyJet flight back instead and having that cancelled too. We were just about to search for a 3rd return flight.Fair play Liz for going for it anyway, I just can't bring myself to travel without being covered by insurance. Safe trip and hope you have a great time.Now to try and get back this £700 for the hotel we booked through Booking.com that was non-refundable... :("
"@Nicky B and Liz H, Nicky gutted for you, we're due to go Aug 29, wish I had courage to go without insurance, just can't and work won't let us quarantine. If it'd happened when we were there we'd have had just been given unpaid leave which we were willing to do, however can't go now. Liz, have an amazing time and stay safe. Nicky, same now to try to get refunds, though we're considering changing flights to Naples. Ah, what a rubbish year. Take care everyone"
We are still going to go on Saturday if flight still going. Does anyone know if we need to fill in another enter Croatia form as when we filled it in we had no quarantine requirements at that time and now we do and one of the questions is does yours country have quarantine measures?
No new form needed.
"Liz, if I was in Dubrovnik I'd buy you a dinner. That's the traveling spirit! Have a wonderful time. :)"
"Due to fly tomorrow, and return Tuesday with a couple of friends, they have decided not to go, but everything is paid for... Im deciding whether to think sod it and just go anyway ?"
If you are able to stay in your house for two whole weeks when you get back then I'd guess that's your main obstacle to deciding whether to go. You'd not be insured but it's only a short break I guess.
"Jools, please don't keep saying people won't be insured. That's inaccurate. Some will be covered, some won't and some will be partially covered. Varies between policies and depending on when the booking was made and the policy was taken out. https:/…alreadybooked"
"Yes on insurance I've taken a passing look at the FAQ's on Direct line where i have an annual policy. First of all if the trip and insurance were booked before the FCO advice changed (both where) then im covered for most sections, including personal possessions airline failure etc. Im NOT covered if i get ill with covid.Interestingly they will also cover me for cancellation even if airline or holiday company isn't cancelling. I may be able to claim for OH airline ticket. Easyjet will only allow the whole booking to move so by me going we were forfeiting his plane ticket, but it cost under £100 at the time of booking."
"Apt22 and therein lies your problem, it will be an insurance minefield and therefore a risk to anyone who can't go through the mountains of small print that comes with a policy be sure they understand it and be sure it will still cover all eventualities. Liz says hers doesn't cover covid illness, so if God forbid the worst happens and she ends up in a bad way in hospital it can cost 10k+ to get flown home.I'm health and safety for a living so I will always see the risks where they exist."
"The people in Croatia making it feel like those that aren't going are not in the travelling spirit or why would we want to be stuck in Croatia - it's not that simple, I adore Croatia and would love to live there when I retire, its still a difficult decision that not everyone can make because if flights stop people have pets being cared for, cars accruing fines in airport parking, jobs and wage issues if we can't work, who gets food shopping if we have to be stuck in our homes for two weeks when we return. It's not that some people are better than others,it's that most people just aren't in a position to stay if the flights stop like they did in Spain."
"We can quarantine but the FCO advice invalidates our insurance and with pre existing physical health problems that are lurking in the background but could flare up, we can't take the risk of going uninsured. Second risk is with a two week holiday, the return flight could be pulled if flights out cease due to worsening conditions or very low demand. Third risk is that our house and cat sitter goes off to uni very soon after our planned return so an extension to our trip won't be possible. The airline is currently still selling flights, but cancelling week by week with very little notice. As we've booked accommodation separately, we'd be very vulnerable if things change while we're out there, but potentially lose money if we cancel with short notice. Could someone wave a magic wand and make this virus disappear please?"
"Why not take a detour? Stay in Croatia then go to a country where you can freely enter, stay one night and then from there off to the UK? Do not expect monies in return from Croatian hotels or private home lessees. Borders aren't closed. Your country is just forcing you to spend cash in the UK. The case with Slovenia is just a bad joke. After Jelko Kacin, last Slovenian politician to leave Croatia this summer returned home, the very next day Croatia got red-flagged."
"Hi Liz. We are in the same situation. We were due to fly out yesterday to Dubrovnik. Gutted as I couldn’t change my annual leave from work. We did consider taking the risk and go but we too are worry about being stranded in Dubrovnik and this would be disastrous given that I am on medication and we have two cats at home being looked after by a pet sitting service. Seeing that Montenegro, Bosnia and Austria are also on the red list rerouting there to get home would not be possible. For all we know Italy is being on the watch too and it would be a risk rerouting there if the FCO decides to put them on the red list too mid way through the holiday. And it all just too much of a headache. But we will be back as we love Croatia. Have travelled there many times including Dubrovnik. But we managed to change our flight to the Algarve in September. And I did get a 50% refund from a super-understanding host on Airbnb. Good luck on your travel plans and cancellations."
"Hi Makarska, the idea of routing your return through a green list country sounds good, but there is a problem. On the return to UK country you are specifically asked which other countries you have been to and when. If you were so inclined you could lie about this, but take a chance that nobody ties your passport number to your itinerary. Going through a green list country would however reduce the length of your quarantine in the UK"
