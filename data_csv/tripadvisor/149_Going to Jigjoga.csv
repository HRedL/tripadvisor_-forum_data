"Hi, I understand that there is no more mandatory hotel quarantine if we negative COVID-19 test. But I wanted to ask if we can travel to Jigjiga as we live there. We are coming from London. We are wondering if it’s possible to do airport transfer and go jigjiga. Or do we have to same in Addisababa for the 7 day and then go. We'll appreciate your answers"
I just came back from Addis Ababa Ethiopia this morning. I travelled from London and I had the Covid-19 negative certificate. I am not sure if you are aware but Ethiopia will NOT accept the NHS free Covid-19 test. I paid £149 private clinic.The new requirement is that your certificate must be valid for 5 days upon arrival to Ethiopia. If you going to stay in Addis Ababa or Jigjiga then you will most likely undergo a Covid-19 test in the airport.
My friend from London had the certificate and travelled to jigjiga and they made her stay in hotel. I am not sure why but the system in that region can be a bit of a nuisance. Good luck to you and safe journey
