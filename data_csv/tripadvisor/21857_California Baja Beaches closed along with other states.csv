"Authorities in at least three states have announced beach closures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.Baja California Sur closed every beach in the state, where municipal police will be responsible for ensuring that the closure is upheld. It could prove challenging during the normally busy Semana Santa (Holy Week) vacation in April.https:/â€¦Also the beaches in the State of Guerrero....Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo/Acapulco will close tonight at 8PM.Edited: 5:20 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Well I guess when Mexico shuts stuff down, they really shut it down. This is sad in my opinion. Fully understandable that groups shouldn't be forming on beaches but to read a post from a man in his 70's walking the beach in La Paz with no one around for miles, to be chased out by police ....very sad! Common sense is also being shut down world wide!Edited: 11:36 pm, April 02, 2020 "
If people had common sense it would have never escalated so quickly. Watch infection rates for New Orleans (Mardi Gras) and Florida (spring break) in the next few weeks. New York is blowing up as we speak.
"Mexicans are big on their Semana Santa vacations...and school usually would close today for two weeks in a NORMAL year. So many Mexicans I am sure already have their vacations planned and many own property where they can drive/fly to. The timing seems to have been maybe set just because of this. I know Guerrero beaches have been shut down and places like Zihuataneo/Ixtapa and Acapulco are huge Mexico City, Colina and Michocan drive downs and there will be tents on the beaches to sleep in, food brought in cars and huge extended families pile into the vehicles. I think the authors of this new law probably had to do this to try to stop the virus from coming or getting worse. When you can't see the sand on the beaches from so many people taking up every inch...probably the best idea!"
"Our beaches are mostly closed as well, Coronado is open during the week, but not weekends.Here is the mango Deck Webcam, I watched for a minute or so, not a person in sight.https://www.mangodeckcabo.com/live-webcams/Edited: 1:22 pm, April 04, 2020 "
Judy you are exactly right SOCIAL DISTANCING cannot be done when thousands of people are headed to the beach. Unfortunately we may have this Pandemic situation with the world until a vaccine is developed.
