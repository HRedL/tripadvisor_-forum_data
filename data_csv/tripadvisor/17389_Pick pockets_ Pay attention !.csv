"Yea,I heard about the pick pockets. I am a very experienced traveler? I had my wallet deep in the front pocket of a tight pair of Levi's. I had trouble getting it out. A team of at least 2 adults and 2 pre-teen boys caught me boarding a train at the Spagna stop. A Stanger warned me the kid had his hand in my pocket. By the time I got my hand to my pocket,the wallet was gone. I NEVER FELT A THING! I still can't figure out how he did it, but,that kid had skills.IF YOU SEE LOOSE KIDS,YOU HAD BETTER GET YOUR HAND ON YOUR VALUABLES !!"
"That's how they work all over the world - they can be pros at it. A pocket is a terrible place for a wallet, etc - Never again, hopefully."
"Never carry your valuables in a pocket, no matter how tight you think your pants are. A money belt or secure purse is always a better idea. This type of thing happens all over the world so an investment into a secure way to carry your valuables is a good idea.Donna"
How about a photographer's vest with zipper internal pockets?
No secure enough. These pick pockets are professionals. Get a money belt or a secure purse/bag such as a pacsafe bag.Donna
Is my camera safe on a cross chest strap?
"Pick pockets are after cash, not cameras. If you leave your camera laying around someone will take it but no one is going to rip it off your neck to get it. Violent crime is very rare in Italy. Donna"
"Honestly, Denverbri69, you really don't need to be so paranoid - you are not going into the 9th circle of hell - Rome has much less violent crime than any city/town in the U.S. You will be fine. Just like the rest of the world, iPhones and such are hot items so just keep them close to you and safe - no big deal to do. Hang onto your stuff - don't lay it down on a table when eating outside or hang a bag on the back of a chair in a restaurant - all the same sort of common sense stuff you would use anywhere in the world."
"Thanks, postings like this one exaggerate my paranoia. I grew up in NYC and I am naturally protective. But there is so many warnings about pickpockets in Rome, it makes it sound epidemic."
It's not as bad as it seems but they are out there. Just be aware of your surroundings and don't let strangers too close to you. Use a money belt ( worn under your clothes so no one knows it's there and cannot get to it) for your valuables such as money or credit cards and carry your camera across your body or at least around your neck. I've never had issues with taking my DSLR and if you take normal precautions you shouldn't either.Donna
"People rarely post things saying ""oh, nothing happened to me!"" - so, of course, the usual postings are likely to be about something like this happening and really - putting a wallet in a pocket is just not a great idea - anywhere one uses public transportation or is in crowded places or walking a lot. I don't personally bother with money belts and all that stuff - I have my own way of dealing with my stuff and in about 25 trips to Rome never even had a tug on my bag and I am one of those people everyone warns others about: I use a backpack - always, where I live, travel, wherever. I drop it down and hold to my side when on public transportation or in a crowd so as to minimize any possible encroachment and to also not hit people with it while it is on my back - but, the rest of the time? I always use it and keep it closed tight - Everyone finds their own way of feeling secure with their belongings; if moneybelts make people more comfortable, definitely use them (there are sorts of other security items one can get - even socks with pockets on them for credit cards/cash if you want! - saw them on various website)If you grew up here (NYC), then I'm sure you know just what you need to do - pickpocketing happens here in crowded places (Times Square, Penn Station, etc) - nothing different. I have often pointed out to people eating at outdoor restaurants (here too) that maybe they should put away the phone/tablet/camera because especially professional thieves are fast as lightning and you won't even see it happen when stuff gets snatched like that. Have fun - I'm sure you will have loads of incredible photos by the end of your trip. My biggest fear has been me forgetting my camera somewhere so I always make sure to have some sort of info on it with my contact info - and either uploading your photos regularly, etc is a good idea to avoid losing the photos if something does happen to the camera."
Denverbri69. don't believe they arent after cameras! My son had his SLR in his camera bag cross chest but it still was taken while he was paying for something. Keep it to the front. and your hand on it.
They take anything that they can sell on easily.
"""People rarely post things saying ""oh, nothing happened to me!"" - so, of course, the usual postings are likely to be about something like this""I'll be the first! Just returned from another Italy trip and never had a problem. Just used common sense."
I had nothing at all in my pockets. My phone and the bulk of my money was in a money belt under my trousers. I had a wallet with a Velcro fastener on a lanyard around my neck which lay under my shirt. The wallet contained just a few euros for incidentals. I never felt threatened or uneasy..... But that doesn't mean I wasn't being watched.
Putting your wallet in the front pocket of tight jeans is no different than putting up a big neon sign saying pick me.
"Everyone is always being watched by pickpockets. And they target the easiest prey. If there's no prey, they move to another metro wagon, they wait for another tram, etc.I always have a very small wallet with 3-5 E in it in my front pocket. In packed public places, I put my hand in the pocket where my small wallet is. The bulk of my money and my cards are in a pouch that I put under my clothes.I have seen pickpockets in action a few times, and I have alerted the victims when I could. Everytime, the victims were not paying attention to their surrounding and the money was easily accessible.Make it difficult for the pickpockets to access the money and you'll be just fine.Edited: 3 years ago "
"The pickpockets like it to be easy. You may have thought that the pocket was so tight that you were making things difficult, but you were obviously mistaken, because they took your wallet anyway. Next time, make it so difficult for them that you don't become a victim. (I was a victim once, I learnt from it and vowed never again)"
We also had no problems in Rome. I kept a small amount of money in a purse buried in my handbag ( amongst so many other bits and pieces I often had trouble finding it!) with my credit card in a separate zipped internal pocket. Handbag was always zipped shut with an extra clip holding it closed. Bag then carried close to body with hand on strap. My hubby had a backpack again with zippers fastened with extra clips and phone and wallet buried deep and zipped in. Also if you are with someone else just watch each other's backs particularly in crowded locations and when you may be distracted such as taking photos or buying tickets.
"So what I'm taking from reading some comments is that it really is pockets they are picking for the most part & not bag grabbing like they do in Asia? Or is that too simplistic? I know there's no rules to this per se, but in Asia, you're generally safe if you have a cross body bag & you hold it as well, and walk with the oncoming traffic so that motor bikes don't race past you and grab your bag. And generally speaking, the chances of people cutting backpacks & stealing is more likely than actually picking your pockets too.Is that the generalization here?"
"Nessnem - Yes, pockets are picked. I have always used a cross body bag with inside zipper compartments for my passport, credit cards etc. to keep them safe (you must keep your passport on you at all times, it's the law).I've seen the scooter bag grab in Bali but I have not heard of it happening where I travel in Italy (Rome, Naples, Amalfi Coast, Florence, Venice).Bottom line - no matter how 'tight' your pocket or how much you think you're aware of your surroundings, these thieves are experts. Never leave valuables in pockets."
Violent crime like that is very rare so wearing your bag across your body will be fine. Pick pockets are just mainly after quick cash so keep your valuables in a secure place and you should be fine. Back packs are easy targets for pick pockets. They won't cut them off of you but they will rifle through them and take your valuables. Donna
"Ok thanks, that's the way I thought I was reading it. Yes their job is to watch us whilst we are watching all the wonders & sites & smells happening around us so I get they're pros at this stuff! Cross body, inside zips etc & carry as little as possible! Passport....yes got in trouble over 20 years ago for not having passport but was let off & told to go back to hotel & get it given we'd done nothing wrong & it was a random check! Freaky experience though I must say!!And yes Kathy, the scooter snatch & grab is spreading throughout Asia but I've never seen it personally."
"I have made photocopies of our passports that we will be carrying with us. What is the general idea about using credit cards in Rome? To go out for a day for shopping and eating, I am estimating I would need a couple of hundred Euros with me. Thoughts?I wear a phtographer's vest with zipped inside pockets and velcro pockets. Are the thieves good enough to open a velcro flap breast pocket?"
Denverbri69 - you need to carry your original passport. A photocopy is not compliant with the local laws.I would use a money belt rather than the photographer's vest as they are much more difficult for a thief to access - if not impossible.
"Yes, as Kathy says, you are legally required to carry your original passport with you at all times. And, yes, pick pockets are good enough to get into velcro pockets, even on the inside. A photographers vest is not a good choice for securing your belongings.Donna"
"We were in Rome late September. Just pay attention. We didn't ever feel like a victim, or that we were targeted and had to shield our stuff. Even at Trevi Fountain, at night. Just be smart.No one is out to target you. Yes, if you are an easy mark, it might happen. But don't be all suspicious. Just be smart.Edited: 3 years ago "
"""To go out for a day for shopping and eating, I am estimating I would need a couple of hundred Euros with me."" Shopping an eating need defining a bit :-)You could happily go out with 30 Euros per person for very nice lunch, and were you to stray beyond, you would find credit card facilities. Menus posted. Shops open till late so you can rest legs and mull the purchase in the afternoon... So you need a couple of modest bills, some shrapnel for the tiny tip in dish if having a coffee or juice in a bar (where there are toilets). And a credit card. Debit card when you want to draw cash from ATM. Most of which you stash back at base. Carry passport. Have photocopy of passport etc back safely in accommodation. I alsp put trip details and passport etc info in a word doc at a cloud location I can access from an internet cafe. In case of whatever. If worried about touts and pickpockets always look like you know what you are doing, where you are going. Even if you have no clue. You can argue with yourself or someone while walking purposefully; perhaps rude to chew gum at the same time."
How safe are zipped pockets about knee high?
NZMike - any pockets are vulnerable. Knee high pockets on the average man are easily picked by 10 year old kids and some of these pickpockets are children. Keep your valuables safe in a money belt or messenger/cross body bag.
"@ nessnemI have never seen pickpockets try to steal the whole bag, but I have witnessed pickpockets unzip a handbag to get the wallet out. As long as the lady has her bag in front of her with her hand on top of the zip nothing will happen as there are easier targets."
"I'm happy to say we ( family - mum dad, 2 grown up kids ) travelled Italy and had no unfortunate pick pocket experiences. My daughter and I had regular handbags ( nice ones ) and at times my daughter carried a clutch purse. My son and husband had backpacks and when moving from city to city we also toted huge suitcases. We hit all the main tourist spots in the month of June so their were quite a lot of tourists with us. We rode local and long distance trains and local bus services across the country. So, it can happen - you can be safe.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Oh for goodness sake! Hundreds of thousands of tourists go to Italy every year and nothing bad happens to them.There are thieves everywhere, just be sensible. Do what you at home.""I never felt threatened or uneasy..... But that doesn't mean I wasn't being watched.""Doesn't mean you were either."
"<Do what you at home.>This is poor advice. People 'doing what they do at home' - e,g leaving wallets in pockets and hanging handbags on chairs - results in theft. There is nothing wrong with taking extra security precautions. It is far worse interrupting valuable holiday time reporting lost and stolen cards and - worse - having to adjust budgets or skip sights because cash was stolen."
"Here's what I do at home. Walk into local cafe,put my bag on the table, take purse out , go up to order coffee , get chatting to one of the other locals, go and sit down. coffee arrives and all the time my bag with phone inside is on the table. So no I would never do what I do at home."
"We've just returned from our 12th trip to Rome and again didn't have a problem the whole time we were there. I had my wallet in my bag, which has a cross body strap. I always made sure the wallet was buried at the bottom under all my other crap I lug around, but other than that I didn't take any other precautions other than to keep the zipper pressed against my body in very busy areas. My husband kept his wallet in his front jeans pocket and in busy areas just put his hand in his pocket too. Just normal precautions that we'd take in any major city. I always feel totally comfortable in Rome, even when walking back to our hotel late at night. The OP had a bad experience and that's a pity, but it should't be a cause for paranoia about the city!"
"> Then she immediately started texting and giving instructions on her phone.Giving instructions To whom, the almighty Spectre?She was probably texting home that a suspect guy was unpolitely staring her. And why staring back a ""suspicious"" guy should be a mistake? Revenge pickpoketing? And what makes somebody, suspicious, the sun glasses? Roman boys would wear them even during their weddings if they could..."
"So the woman helped you and instead of saying thanks you stared? Are you serious?Those who control children pickpockets never stay in the same place while children are ""working"". Why should they? Kids under 13 can't be put in jail while adults can and would be if they were filmed at Termini controlling or giving orders."
"A gang of children tried to pick-pocket my 67 year old mother a few weeks ago in Pisa. I knew they were up to no good and told her to watch out for them. She buried her wallet at the bottom of her cross-body, zipped bag and they did the ""you distract and I'll steal from her"" trick, rushing her as she went up the stairs of the train with her bag. I was close behind and shoved the one girl while my mother slapped the other girl's hand. Then, they hurried off the train before the doors closed. They didn't get anything. This was my first experience with pickpocketers. I am a somewhat experienced traveler and have lived in major cities, including Manhattan. That said, other than that experience and the others we heard about at stations very close to Pisa on the same day, we had no other issues nor did we hear of anything and I've not had any friends tell me about bad experiences either. So, it can happen -- even to those who are being careful -- but the likelihood is slim."
"> I don't understand why I am bring aggressively challenged for describing a story as I experienced it.Because your story makes no sense and you did not understand anything of what happened around you. Neither the guy wearing sunglasses nor the texting woman had something to do with the girl who tried to pickpocket youDo you want to know how that woman tells the same story? ""I helped an obvious American tourist and he did not feel the need to say thanks. I don't like stereotypes, but hey... they really are an ugly bunch! He kept on staring me till I pretended I was texting to make him stop. And I had just chased away the girl who tried to pickpocket him! Unbelievable, isn't it?""Edited: 3 years ago "

"BucHaish i will challenge not your story, not what happened, but your conclusions from it. Heck, it could have been me! I often ride the metro and the bus and know the gangs of pickpocket children by sight (anyone who is a regular on certain lines knows them). They are without adults so they can come away without legal problems (unfortunately there is nothing the law can do as long as they are this young). My husband knows them, too; and i have definitely at times written him how i just witnessed they were at it again, how i intervened, etc. It is a weekly occurance for me really, that i intervene. My husband is already afraid they'll do smth to me bcs i thwart their attempts so often. So yes, neither NapOrsoCapo71 nor i (probably) was not there and i do not doubt the facts of your story - but i do think your conclusion, how you put together the story is wrong. A lost in translation moment. There is no reason to get angry (with us)!"
"I'd like to point out that it's better to avoid confrontation when such things happen, a loud verbal alert toward the person getting pickpocketed or harassed is usually enough. Personally I witnessed a couple of Japanese tourists on the early phase of getting pickpocketed in Milan subway, I simply put a hand over the shoulder of the woman doing this and told her to stop it. She went off at the next station with her partner in crime. Nowadays I realize that these people could have actually sued me, so better think twice."
"If you just put an hand on her shoulder, they had no reason to sue you and the file would have been immediately dismissed by any attorney. You behaved exactly as the law says, well done."

"I'm sorry to hear about your bad experience. We travelled through Italy, including Rome last June but thankfully *touchwood* did not get our pockets/bags picked.Like many other posters, stay alert especially in crowded areas and keep your hand AND eyes on your belongings. I would err on the side of caution and avoid putting anything valuable in my pockets. I used a pacsafe crossbody bag and my husband used a pacsafe backpack (together with a money belt). We also reminded each other not to leave our wallets, mobile phones or camera on the tables when dining. We are heading back to Rome this year and we hope the experience will still be a postive one!"
I've bought both a pacsafe purse and pacsafe camera bag!
"Putting your hand in the pocket with your money/cards tells the pickpocket where to look. A few years ago on the subway in Athens my husband (who has learned his lesson) had his wallet in his front pocket with his hand in there too. Someone on the crowed train asked his what time it was and he started to remove his hand to look at his watch. Luckily he realized what was going on in time to slap the stranger's hand going into his pocket.We keep money, cards and passports inside our clothing in hidden pockets. We also use travel vests with inside pockets. These fit fairly closely and the inside pockets are zippered. So far so good with this method in France, Italy, Croatia, Argentina, Chile and other places."
"we were in italy last week (rome, florence, and venice) and enjoyed it - felt safe walking around and no signs of any pickpockets - and I'm normally aware of my surroundings... lovely place too :)couple of pointers tho - I'm aware of that cafe near the vatican museum where you get charged over 50 euro for a snack and a drink as they have no prices... but when walking around and we sat down for a coffee- we commonly got charged 4-5 euros for a small cappuccino and I often felt like that included a tourist tax..! (i.e. the locals would have maybe got charged less?)we enjoyed some great meals (mainly pasta and pizza) for around 50 euros but that included bottles of wine etc...the buses and metros were very cheap - but always struggled to validate the bus ticket as the machine would flash the red light - but the bus driver never seemed to care... tho, one day some guys came over to assist us and took away our paper part of the ticket (and left us with the card part) whilst quickly saying our ticket was ok - they then quickly got off...i thought it was neat how the bus inspectors were in plain clothes - but now I'm not sure they were inspectors and just nicked our ticket? haha..!we managed to buy some cheap drinks from various supermarkets - including 3 litres of red wine (that came from a vat) in a small market - that was 4.50 euros... and a bottle of vodka for just over 6 euros and some lemoncillo for 4.99 - both from a supermarket - bargain prices..!Edited: 3 years ago "
"yep, that's what I think - as it happened so quickly haha... think this happened in venice - and we got the ticket from a shop and came with a piece of card and a bit of paper... I assume it;s the actual card that you need to scan on the machine?"
