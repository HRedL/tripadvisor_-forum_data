"Situation is kind of chaotic. Most of the Schengen zone countries have closed their borders for any ""non-essential"" travel. Allowed were only nationals and legal residents returning to their country, some workforce considered ""essential"", staff for merchandise transport (and as usual diplomats). Some countries have even set strict travel restrictions within their own borders. Information on enforcement of those rules are partially contradictory, restrictions already eased the one, two weeks. There are some attempts coordinating border closure and reoping rules within Schengen area countries - not really successful. Many countries plan to reopen borders to other Schengen/EU residents this June 15. Italy has already reopened the borders to other Schengen zone countries. Austria reopened the borders but not for Italy. Exceptions are expected for visitors from Sweden. But there is hardly any information on possible plans by Schengen zone countries on reopening exterior borders to regular visitors. Considering the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Ukraine - May and still in June around 500 new cases per day - I doubt Schengen zone borders for visitors from (and to) Ukraine will be reopened soon.Edited: 5:16 am, June 09, 2020 "
"It's only up to Belgium authorities to decide whom and when they admit to Belgium. The quarantine in Ukraine doesn't hinder a Ukrainian person to exit their country at any point of the time. The only question is which country admits a Ukrainian passport holder at the moment.The EU banned non-essential foreigners from visiting till the end of June. Belgium, as a country with one of the highest per capita reported covid deaths rate in the world and a current infection rate roughly similar to that of Ukraine (per 100 000 population), probably will be more cautious in opening to tourism, especially from the countries which aren't its normal supplier of wealthy tourists/no other significant economic ties and probably naturally expecting its citizens to be aware of the Belgium sovereignty over its borders and be patient."
