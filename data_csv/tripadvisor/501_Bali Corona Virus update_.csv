"Hi Everyone,I am traveling with my wife to Bali on 26 March 2020 till 6 April 2020. As I am seriously concern about the spread of Corona Virus in Indonesia, as now there are a total 19 confirmed cases. Can anyone assure me that Bali is safe but it would be great to hear from other travelers that are planning to visit or already there, Thanks in advance"
"Bali is lucky there are no positive Covid-19 patients in Bali, however hundreds all tested and all are negative."
Hopefully Greg with the crystal balls will be able to answer.
