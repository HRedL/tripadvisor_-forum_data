The question hasn’t been asked yet. Just curious if anyone has canceled their upcoming trip to Kauai?
"Yes, my husband and I did last week. We are 65 years old, do some international trips each year for diving, but decided this first time trip was too uncertain and risky to take for a week trip in early May. Too far to go with such uncertainty and possible travel disruption though we did have a nonstop flight from Denver to Kauai and back. We were heartbroken to cancel. But did so before the chaos broke out about travel abroad...and because we were more than 60 days out, got full refund on resort and lost a couple hundred dollars each on cancelled flight....but much better to take the sure thing than do the “wait and see” for us. Happy with our decision....Kauai will always be there.... another time."
no
Another no from us. Will be there in less than a month and not planning on cancelling unless anything happens beyond our control.
"Our trip starts a month from today. Unless the flight is cancelled, we plan to go. We are all healthy."
Not planning on canceling.
"Unless the planes stop flying, we are coming on March 21st. If one of us (family of four) is sick, obviously we wouldn't. We will bring 30 days supply of medication in the rare chance we got sick on island and had to stay a while. None of us are high risk. I'm just so bummed because normally with less than two weeks to go, I am super excited, but now I just watch the news and pray things don't get worse."
"Not us. We are set to land in Maui for 2 days starting April 2nd and then onto our beloved Kauai on April 4th for 2 weeks. Unless the airlines cancel, we are not changing our plans. My brother is planning to come for part of our stay and it will be his first visit to the island. He is a major germaphobe and I am talking him off the ledge constantly regarding this trip. Like Karina, I am continuously watching the news reports on what airlines are cancelling and where."
Have any airlines started cancelling flights to kauai yet?
"No, instead I booked a trip to Kauai next month and cancelled a trip to Vegas. I figure if I have to self-quarantine I’d rather be in Kauai."
My husband’s co worker just booked a trip today for April. He couldn’t resist the low airfare. The company is all working from home now until the foreseeable future so he figures he’d rather do it in Kauai.
"One of my employees just cancelled their March trip. Hawaii isn’t going anywhere, and they decided that a vacation where you worry isn’t a vacation at all."
"No, my family and I leave in two days! I briefly considered but given we are all healthy we decided against canceling."
"I’m a little nervous as well. My beloved brother passed away unexpectedly on Christmas, and my twin sister and I have been so crushed, and one bright spot was deciding to plan a trip to Kauai in his honor, as he’d wanted to go for years, but kept putting it off for the retirement he was going to take next year. Anyhow— my sister has compromised respiratory health, and is definitely in the high risk category. We are scheduled for first week of May, and we booked a house that has a no refund policy. Obviously my sisters health is worth more than losing out on the money, but it’s disappointing that we will likely not get to go."
"I've asked this on another thread (different island) but for those of you who aren't worried about your own health, do you have any concern about sitting in a crowded airport, airplane etc with others who ""aren't concerned"" and are unaware that you all may be carriers? You don't have to exhibit symptoms (incubation can take 2 weeks during which time you are contagious) This is to a large degree how these things spread. This isn't the ""regular"" flu. No one knows how this is going to behave. Containment is the only thing at this point that will slow the spread. As ChiSue asked, ""would you book this trip today?"" Medical bills are way more costly than a cancelled trip, even with great insurance."
"I arrived yesterday and flew from San Francisco to Lihue. Even in a crowded airport there are places to go where you can maintain a safe distance from other people. I flew United. They've enhanced their sanitation procedures, sterilizing every surface inside the plane between flights. I fly to Kauai 4 times a year. There is always ""that person"" on the plane who is coughing or sneezing up a storm. That was not the case yesterday. Honestly, I heard one cough (from a distance) during the 5+ hour flight. The flight attendants no longer hand you a beverage. They deliver it on a tray and you pick the can/cup up directly from the tray. I brought a couple small packs of disinfectant wipes and used a few on the plane to re-wipe the seat belt and tray table. Went to Costco when I arrived...they are using sanitizer on the carts between shoppers. Costco was well-stocked....there appeared to be no shortages. I am staying in Princeville and Foodland was well stocked with toilet paper in addition to all groceries....everyone's biggest fear, it seems! There is no sense of panic on the island. Maybe it will come, and maybe it won't, but my mindset is that I will be much more relaxed about it here on Kauai than in the midst of fear on the mainland."
"Bellyqueen to answer your question I absolutely worry about high risk groups. I’m not so worried about getting it myself but I don’t want to spread it. That’s how I was able to get my hand sanitizer adverse husband to actually use it in public and use it when he gets in his car until he can get home and wash his hands. I’m really surprised at how I’m seeing very little changes in behavior. I went to a very full Pilates class tonight and myself and only 3 others cleaned their mats before and after class, yet our shelves are completely clear of rubbing alcohol, TP and hand sanitizer. It doesn’t make sense."
"The behavior changes will come quickly. I want to quote at length a post from another website I saw that resonates:I am coming back after a week [to post]. On March 2nd I wrote: ""the spread of the virus in Italy is not as disastrous as you may be led to believe"". After a week, I am writing now: the spread has gone exponential, with number of cases doubling every three days. When thing go exponential, you change ideas very quickly as the situation around you changes so quickly.When we will get back and write the history of these weeks, we will see some phases. First the phase ""no problems"", then the phase of binge shopping. Then the phase ""it is bad for the economy"". Then the phase ""let us take some measures"". Now in Italy the phase is ""stay at home, for Christ's sake!"".This morning - in Italy it is morning as I write - I woke with a joke on my fb account. Jesus saying: I do not know if I will come to you next Easter. Everybody replying: do not worry, we will be coming to you by Easter time!I see that some you are still in the phases ""should be traveling"" and ""what to do"". It is a phase. Just wait: you will be astounded how fast you will change your minds.Edited: 2:36 am, March 10, 2020 "
"A lot of people seem to be in “this is all made up” category too. When I did something as innocuous as clean my yoga mat the woman next to me who I’ve known for years said “ oh my god the sky is falling!”,"
"At this point, our trip is still far enough out (mid-June) that we are planning to come. We will wait and see how things look closer to the trip but I will hold off on booking on-island activities that I had planned to pre-book until closer to the trip.Some parts of our trip are nonrefundable but, unfortunately, that's just the way it goes sometimes."
Crazy that these things seem to happen every single election year. I am not scared and I hope and pray that my flight on the 25th isn't cancelled. Haven't been back to Kauai in 17 years and looking so forward to it.

"Planning on leaving for Oahu first next Tues then travel to Kauai. Havent made a call yet, but my biggest concern is all flights cancelled and we can not get back to the mainland. But as of now we will pay a high penalty to postpone as there are no advisorys for the US. We booked through United Vacations. Things by the minute seem to be escalating and it is very unsettling. I want to be in Hawaii and relax and enjoy being there not stress about what is happening at home. Anyone else in the same boat?"
"Yes, it's indeed interesting when you compare it to other past epidemics and the panic factor involved with each. At this roughly same point in time the Swine flu epidemic had killed over 1,000 people, worldwide and I never saw this kind of panic.On Hawaii.......If I were in any panic mode I think I'd rather be in Hawaii right now. This article below from the Beat of Hawaii puts Hawaii in perspective:https:/…The Hawaii Dept. of Health reports that a total of 2 people have tested positive, the latest being someone who came there from Washington state. And no signs of community spread.An abundance of caution while flying to Hawaii is important . However, at this point Hawaii has had no community spread. I hope this forum doesn't add to the fear factor. At this point it's premature. Again, I'd feel safer in Hawaii right now. And there is no reason for airlines to begin cancelling flights to Hawaii of all places right now. This is starting to remind me of the posts we get when there's a hurricane off the coast of South America.Edited: 11:40 am, March 10, 2020 "
"NO cancellation here.Husband and I just came back from Kauai yesterday. Still planning our next trip for this November.If people want to be scared for no reason and cancel that's up to them.Our life style is to full to have something as small and common as the flu to stop us.As my husband said, people just need to use common sense during cold and flu season, wash your hands, use sanitizer if you touch common areas and cover your mouth when you sneeze or or cough and YELL at the people that don't cover their mouth to embarrass them so they don't forget next time.This should be done EVERY cold and flu season.This has to be put into perspective, MORE people have died from the regular flu during this same time than this thing.It's just that is NOT news.FACT: 14,000 people have died this year from the regular flu, less than 30 have died during that same time from this thing.Perspective....Edited: 12:56 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Napa.......COVID-19 has killed more than 4,000 people already......compared to 1K for swine flu. Why wouldn't people be more worried?Hawaii hasn't tested people. Only 19 people have been tested. The Lt. Gov admitted that they have ""severely rationed"" all tests. They claim they will ""soon"" expand testing.Anyone who believes there are only 2 cases in Hawaii is deceiving themselves...willingly or otherwise.While I feel safer in Hawaii than I would in many parts of the mainland....all you people encouraging travel don't help keep things better. Of course, I don't own rental property, or have other interests in tourism to skew my concerns. But simply put..the more who come, the more cases we will get."
Also the fact that there are 60 people in self quarantine at the moment.
"Scheduled to fly out on March 23rd. As of last weekend, we were still planning on going but now not as sure as it's starting to spread rapidly within the US. My wife is pregnant so we're concerned about that. I feel like we're still at a same level of risk just being out and about doing or normal day to day things in Los Angeles. We have until next Monday to cancel without penalty."
"SW, your numbers not correct. From the CDC: For swine flu, April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases, 274,304 hospitalizations, and 12,469 deaths in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.For COVID-19: Worldwide, there were 110,588 COVID-19 cases and 3,841 deaths as of Monday morning (3/9); 62,109 people worldwide have recovered, according to data published by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. From CDC: As of March 7, 2020, there were a total of 213 cases within the United States, of which, 49 were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings. There have now been 11 reported deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19."
"Arlo, I'm not going to argue with you.....but I will note that the CDC has much different numbers than you mentioned:https:/…cases-in-us.htmlI stand by my remarks.....just like you, I am allowed to have my opinion based on the extensive reading and research I have done.Edited: 2:31 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"""FACT: 14,000 people have died this year from the regular flu, less than 30 have died during that same time from this thing. Perspective....""FACT: Influenza has been around for millennia. Covid-19 has been around for a few months.FACT: Influenza season this year started many months before the first Covid case arrived in AmericaFACT: Americans have no immunity to covidFACT: Covid is much more fatal than this year's flu, especially to older peopleFACT: The US has done nothing to prepare and (as you show) continues to be in denial and thus will be hit hardFACT: You will be embarrassed by your words in a few months.Edited: 2:32 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"My trip is planned for mid-April and I haven't canceled anything as of now. But I know a lot can and will change in the coming weeks, so I'm just trying to stay informed and see what happens."
"You are correct, SW, that the numbers have now been updated since the last CDC post I saw for March 7. For the U.S., it now stands at:Total cases: 647Total deaths: 25However, your post compared 4,000 global deaths from COVID-19 to 1,000 swine flu deaths just in the U.S. (at the same point in time) . That is not a fair comparison, as it makes it look like the swine flu was less of an issue. For a factual comparison, it would be 25 deaths from COVID-19 compared to 1,000 swine flu deaths for the same point in time in the U.S."
There are so many experts regarding Covid-19 on these forum. Maybe they should apply to work at CDC or their state/city Health Department.

"<>Yup, on the same boat. When I go on vacation I like to truly relax and not worry about anything at all. There is no way I am going to go and not worry about my family, community and mother back home as well as my son with us. I understand that there are risks at home too, but unlike vacation we do not have to rely on everyone else making our food and touching everything that we will be touching.Edited: 3:18 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"It's pretty simple, everybody needs to make their own decision. If you are affraid, stay home (which depending on what state you are from may be worse than traveling), if not ENJOY your vacation. We did and we can't wait to go back in November. We will be traveling as a family as we just did (my husband, myself and the kiddos).This thing needs to be put into perspective, there has been less than 30 deaths in the WHOLE US compared to almost 16,000 (or approximately 2200 per month OR 73 deaths per day) from the regular flu virus for THIS YEAR alone so far. In flu season 2017-2018 over 61,000 people died from the regular flu.Perspective.Once the test kits become available then we will REALLY see how many people have the Corona virus making the 3% number MUCH LESS I'd bet.Just use YOUR OWN judgement on what is good for you as we did.We chose to enjoy our selfs in paradise and not be afraid of something that is being hyped by the media.Just an FYI, while traveling yesterday coming home thru numerous airports and cities we only saw 1 person with a mask out of several thousand traveling (Chinese kiddo). There were 0 (zero) on all the planes we travelled on."
Thanks everyone for your feedback. At this point we are still planning to depart the end of the month. Looking forward to celebrating our birthdays and husbands retirement.
"I would GO to Kauai instead of another place. Flights are dirt cheap. I am not cancelling my trip in a month and my DD just arrived on Oahu (with Jason Momoa on the plane) and said all is good but of course is taking precautions. She cancelled a luau.Now here is what I do if I had a trip planned within the next 30 days and I was elderly (well I am but a healthy older adult), had lung issues or heart trouble/immune issues. I would cancel if I were traveling to Italy, China, Iran or Korea. Come down here to Argentina where I am. Everyone is enjoying life with lots of hand sanitizer available."
"SW, What I talked about was for the U.S. only. I should have clarified. I was comparing the U.S. numbers for this event versus the 2010 swine flu at the same time in the U.S. True, the number you gave for Corona deaths is much higher when you look at the worldwide numbers, most of that being from China which is a very different environment."
And some wonder why folks are confused? Reminds me of all those talking heads LOL!!
"@scincalifornia: people (Americans especially IMO) like to create their own reality. I’m usually right down the middle in these types of things but the mass closings along with the unknowns of this particular virus concern me. (BTW Around here we spray our yoga mats and equipment ANYWAY, yeAr round). My nephew lives in Italy. He’s seen this all unfold there. I’m lying low."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!I live here in Koloa and will say that some folks who live here are emptying the shelves of toilet paper, bleach, hand sanitizer, etc. Costco and Walmart are consistently out. I am not hoarding toilet paper, but since I cannot find one place with disinfecting wipes or hand sanitizer - I actually ordered both online. Even that is difficult because it is apparent price gouging is happening - but for now I am using baby wipes to open doors, clean grocery carts, etc.They need to close our ports in the state to cruise ships - the one that goes between the islands is stilll stopping here. One of the two people in the state with it was on the cruise ship.If,you come here - bring your own disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizer, etc. Malama Pono,Janet"
"If they are going to close ports...they should close airports.One confirmed case from a cruise, and one from a plane. It wasn't the interisland cruise. Most cases will come from flights and hotels.Edited: 12:43 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Ps, the big cruise ships are stopping in Kaua'i too....not just POA.But the impact from ships compared to flights is tiny. Look at the numbers.Edited: 1:24 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Bellyqueen, I’m a middle of road person too. I prepared but didn’t hoard buy like they guy with 6 bottles of rubbing alcohol in his cart! I always clean my own yoga mat but I also cleaned a mat In the studio used for one exercise. I’m sure a sign will be up soon for everyone to it. Hawaii can cancel cruise ships. My area did. https:/…Do commercial flights also bring over cargo?"
"NO! We are going in April and again in August. As of March 8th, there are 2 reported cases of the virus in Hawaii. I believe both are in Honolulu. One was an elderly person who was in Washington State and a second case was a person who had been on the Grand Princess cruise ship."
"(with Jason Momoa on the plane) I'd get check if I was on a plane with him, I saw him on tv recently and he is stick skinny and balding, scary"

"Concerned neighbors of mine with rental units have called Vrbo to see if they have adopted a position and recommendation for owners. They were told Vrbo is recommending full refunds "" if the rental is located in an affected area"". Their words exactly.So what does that mean? Seems to me it's open for a lot of interpretation. At this point right now today I would not consider Kauai to be an affected area.Edited: 11:31 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Ha Ha. The picture of Jason bald and skinning is from a tv ad and its computer generated. My daughter said he was gorgeous (and looked healthy).As far as VRBO's policy they are suggesting to offer refunds if its an effected area ONLY like Italy, China, Korea. This is a good reminder to always buy trip insurance."
"That's right, and you can buy trip insurance that allows you to ""Cancel For Any Reason"". Squaremouth.com is an online broker of trip insurance and you have the option to check Cancel For Any Reason insurance. After playing with it and putting in dates, location, etc. I looked at companies and prices for both regular trip insurance and the Cancel For Any Reason insurance. It was about double the regular price but probably worth it still."
"Yes, some commercial flights also bring cargo---it depends. Some bring mail too.As to stopping cruises....remember that stopping cruises to Hawaii is a HUGE step. You aren't talking stopping a visit to one bay or one island...you are talking a total upset. What do those ships do if they can't dock anywhere in Hawaii?The cruise lines will scream bloody murder if the govt tries to stop cruises and not flights. And frankly, I don't blame them.Edited: 1:04 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I think stopping flights would be just as huge.
"Janet, the only things I couldn't get this past weekend was hand sanitizer and alcohol. I only looked for alcohol in one store. Costco had plenty of paper products and water and Foodland here in Kapaa had lots of Lysol disinfectant including wipes."
"LBender, totally. But that's part of the overall question---how do you pick? What makes cruises ""worse""? Given the focus on them right now, I think they are probably cleaner than they've ever been.....People keep forgetting the incubation period is up to around 2 weeks. They still don't know how long the virus can live on surfaces, some reports now say several days. So I could get it almost anywhere...not just a cruise ship."
"Our trip is in August and we will not be cancelling at this time but will of course revisit our plan around July to determine if we need to. It's too early for us to make any moves right now. Plus, it's our honeymoon.."
"We are planned to go to BI in exactly a month. We are in two minds. Two healthy adults and two pre teen kids. The reason I would cancel is “would I enjoy my vacation and be carefree?” Probably not, I’ll constantly be worrying throughout the trip and thereafter .. is this a true idea of vacation? But will see how things pan out in the next couple of weeks. Ofcourse we will lose all the $ as all our bookings are non refundable."
"Made reservations months ago for two weeks on Kauai and the Big Island in April. Our Delta insurance would let us reschedule, but we have no plans to do so now. Planning to go in mid -April unless the situation gets much worse or Delta suspends flights. Guess I’m encouraged the majority of those responding still plan to go. Maybe there will actually be empty seats on those long Coach flights from Michigan (trying to find a positive)."
"For those of you who have very recently booked and are now unsure of your plans you really need to checkout trip insurance that offers the ""cancel for any reason"" option. You have a limited window of opportunity to purchase after you made your first payment. Some of the companies I checked out say 21 days after the first payment. Don't wait until July to decide on an August trip. If possible get the trip insurance that covers any reason now. Yes, it's about twice the price of regular trip insurance but don't leave yourselves in a position where your lodging hosts tell you it's non-cancellable."

"I understand everyone’s concerns and don’t fault anyone. Do what makes you feel comfortable and safe :). I’m going to Kauai the end of August.

Airports are cleaner than ever right now ;). Be safe peeps!"
"I am very undecided! I have flight to go March 30. They mention over 70, I am 68, underlying health problems, I have a small respiratory problem---nothing major. So, I am concerned. I will never get another opportunity like this---basically just need to pay for my flight---no hotel. My dr. advised me to cancel---but feel like she thinks if I did get the virus she would feel responsible??? I just don't know what to do---right now!

"Our trip is planned for late May / early June. We are all healthy and we have no plan to cancel the trip. Other than the flights, it does not seem to me that we have any more risk in Kauai than we would have at home, unless we were quarantined at home. The flights do present some risk, I suppose, but we are willing to take that risk. Of course, that could change.The person who accused poster #62 of being a troll was way out of line. I would expect more Aloha on this board."
"Instead of our now usual spring trip to Kauai we decided to switch it up and this winter booked a cruise of the Mediterranean, which was to start in Rome and end in Venice. Got a great deal on Balcony stateroom on a small luxury liner. Hah. Even before the cruise cancelled and we were fully refunded we had decided we were not going given the cruise ship news from Japan. How does this answer your question? I really would like a vacation and Kauai calls (it always calls.) But I am not booking flights and lodging in Kauai anytime soon. Why? Because I live in the Bay Area which has quite a few cases and seemingly still growing numbers. It is entirely possible that I could be carrying the virus without knowing so I am staying put and maintaining social distancing protocols. I would have loved to have one more dinner at the Makana Terrace."
"To Colleen, post #69. Great post, Colleen. As always I appreciate your level-headed point of view."
"Yes, the Cancel For Any Reason trip insurance IS indeed more expensive. I checked rates and it can be around $300 for the average amount of airfare and lodging to Hawaii for one week. Almost twice the regular rate. So what? It's $300 well spent over having to worry about the ""should I stay or should I go"" dilemma and not fully recouping the lost dollars."
"Amen to #75!!! Not only is it ""something""...it's a pretty big ""something"" compared to zero."
Would you all expect the condo and house renting agencies (and owners) to be flexible with regard to cancellations (or rescheduling) if the situation gets worse? Or do you suspect they are more likely to adhere strictly to their policies?
"Yes I,m not cancelling my trip as well.Im planning be on Kauai Island on Friday March 20 th with my family and kids for spring break vacation.Unless thay will cancel my flight."
Every person's choice matters in the grand scheme of things. It is more than just one person's trip or money. Please read this https://www.newsweek.com/young-unafraid-coro…
"Onekbear, I can only say what I've heard from owner's and rental agents..... Some are just starting to get cancellation requests. It's a mixed bag. Some owners have received one or two requests and have given a full refund. One person told me that some owners are offering a percentage refund. Others I've talked to said they're not inclined to offer a full refund at this point (unless cancelled within the cancellable period). I've spoken to two large local agencies. Both were more lenient on it and also not charging cancellation fees. But that's only two.In both cases of individual owners and agents the requests to cancel with a refund have been very light."
"IME, as time goes on.....owners and agencies will get harder about refunds. That's what has happened in the past after major upsets.People might think even harder given what Trump said today:""President Trump said on Thursday that he could restrict domestic travel to regions of the United States where the coronavirus becomes “too hot.”Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office whether he was considering limits on travel inside the country to hard-hit states like Washington or California, Mr. Trump said the subject had not yet been discussed, before adding: “Is it a possibility? Yes, if somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot.”No one knows what *his* definition of ""too hot"" is. No one knows how much notice he would give--will it be like yesterday's announcement? Disneyland is closing (only the third time in its history ever). They don't have any cases, they are being proactive....and will be closed until (at least) March 31st.Major events, classes, sports, museums, even the US Capitol have been cancellled, closed, or suspended.Though Hawaii is still singing LALALALA........not so much and that too will change."
I posted earlier in the week when we were on the fence. We've decided to cancel our trip to Kauai that was scheduled to depart on March 23rd. The situation is getting worse and we're not even testing people who need to get tested.
"If we were to decide to cancel, I might propose to rental agency or owner rescheduling for different dates rather than cancel and refund. I am thinking that if I were the lessor, that might be more palatable to me. Anyway, hopefully it won't come to that.'"
"Honestly we may not have a choice. We are suppose to fly to Kauai from California on April 6th, however, if domestic flights to/from California get canceled then clearly we don't have choice. Currently I have mixed feelings about visiting my ""happy place"" which is so sad because normally I am sooo excited for paradise ."
"My husband’s coworker that got lured in by the cheap airfare to Kauai last week just canceled his trip. Or postponed it. A one week 180. Things are escalating so quickly I think the responsible thing to do is stay home. There’s a reason states are closing schools, the NBA postponed their season, Broadway is dark and even Disneyland is closing. There’s billions of dollars tied up to those closings so you can be sure it’s being done for a good reason. It’s time to lay low.Edited: 7:43 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Good question. We have plans to arrive on March 21 and are evaluating day by day. Like someone else noted, my main concern is making sure I don’t bring anything with me. Assuming flights are still going, I think we will keep our plans and may even extend the trip as my kids’ schools are moving to online learning and I can work remotely. But none of us is in a high-risk category. If we were, I would not go."
For those that have cancelled their vacation rental. What options are the owners/managers giving you? Are they allowing you to reschedule or are they sticking with the no refund policy.
"Since the virus can incubate silently for up to 14 days...how can you know if you are ""clean"" or not?  You can't--unless you totally quarantine for 2 weeks and fly a private jet.Please, consider the risk you represent to others.....not just yourselves."
"Yes, SCinCal Which is what some of us were trying to explain a couple weeks ago. Since it escalated here before anywhere else in the US, we saw the effects of the rapid spread. Our governor went from suggesting measures two weeks ago to declaring them yesterday. Why ppl ignored the writing on the wall, and are continuing to do so especially now is beyond me."
"Aloha,I own two condos on Kauai that I rent on VRBO. This is what I’ve sent to all guests booked over the next two months.With the coronovirus uncertainty, you can cancel your reservation at any point in time (even less than 30 days) and receive a full refund including if you cancel on the anticipated arrival day."
"How gracious of you as I'm sure that hurts your financial bottom line, Steve."
"Yes, Steve, that's very generous of you. From what I'm hearing from many other owners your position is not the norm. Most said they aren't willing at this point in time to do that. Some said a partial refund they'd consider. Only a very few said they have already given a full refund to someone. I just wanted to add this as a caveat so everyone isn't expecting what Steve is willing to do. The comments I received reflect the fact that Kauai is not considered an affected area at this point in time. That could change and the owners might change their minds with it.Edited: 11:22 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"#90 Kudos to you Steve. I am having a heck of an experience trying to have our VRBO owner (Maui) offer even a reschedule. Travel insurance (NY) does not cover Pandemics/ Epidemics. Lesson learned.On the other hand, the Kaui owner we are dealing with, is being as kind as you are."
"Ants girl, This was taken from a lady who owns on Maui:""I'd sure contact Vrbo about this if you've cancelled. You may meet resistance from owners, but Vrbo says they will refund fees if the owner agrees to refund. Gosh, even *partial* refund would be good.""Here is the thread, Hope you can find some helpful infohttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29220…"
"oops, Just saw that you posted on that thread. too late for me to remove post. Disregard."
"Good going, Steve, Bravo! You're a good man."
Since I posted — was it only three days ago! So much new information. In that time our Maui condo owner graciously OFFERED for us to reschedule. He didn’t have to since cancellation date has passed. So we decided to check with our Kauai condo owner and he also graciously agreed we can rebook. They have saved us thousands of dollars and we are truly grateful.And Steve you are wonderful to help out your visitors like that! So many people save for so long for such a trip and I know you are losing so much to help.
"Leilani, what awesome owners. I hope you post who and what units after you get all this settled. They deserve the publicity."
"“ but Vrbo says they will refund fees if the owner agrees to refund. Gosh, even *partial* refund would be good”. Nothing new with that. This is VRBO’s policy before all of the virus commotion. If an owner approves of refunding all rental dollars VRBO will refund their service fee they charged the guest. Of course they have to. They’re not going anything new or unusual here."
"@ bellyqueenThanks for the link. I already posted on that thread, twice. And I got another negative response from the VRBO unit owner. Very Frustratiing.First time booking thru VRBO. Unless something changes I don't think I would ever rent thru VRBO again. Time will tell."
"Antsgirl, don't hold it against Vrbo. It's up to the individual owner what their cancellation policy is and how strictly they will adhere to it. Vrbo is just a listing site. Vrbo will give recommendations on how they'd like to see these things handled but ultimately refunds are up to the owner.Edited: 11:46 am, March 13, 2020 "
"@Antsgirl85: Yeah, I was through w/ VRBO a couple years ago b/c they jacked their fees so high. Shame, they used to be a one stop shop when looking for accommodations"
Napaguy.......yes I know. It is just extremely disappointing how unreasonable this particular woman is being. Time will dictate what we ultimately decide to do.
I am still planning on going to Kauai April 3in 3 weeks unless I’m told that I can’t.
"Yes, friends living on the island said no for sure I'll people yet but people are panic buying and the island doesn't get supplies as often as mainland. Said sometimes gas is hard to get too. Kauai has also started closing events and areas down too."
We just decided to cancel our trip next week. It's the right thing to do to limit spread of COVID-19. Canceling our tickets is an issue as we can't get an agent on the phone!
2 new cases confirmed late last night on Kaua'i.
"We get barge supplies in twice a week plus air cargo. Been in Hawaii for almost 19 years, almost 5 on Kauai and never had a problem getting gas. Long lines (at Costco) sometimes but that is the extent of any gas ""problems."""
"Stefanie, we canceled our flight to Key West online. That was with American. We have until 12/20 to re-book."
"We decided today to cancel our trip to Kauai and Oahu that we had scheduled for 4/17-26. We'll reschedule for later this year. I was able to cancel our flights through Alaska and Hawaiian online and just take the credit, and our Airbnb was fully refundable. Canceling a vacation is a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things."
So far still going to Kauai early May - we are in mid-70s and healthy- waiting to see since we still have time
May 17-29 for us.
"As of now, we are still planning to travel to Kauai May 20-30. We are waiting to see how things go..."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!We now (at least what we have been told) have two tourists confirmed with cases of the virus.. They flew here from Maui and had sought medical help there - then got on a plane and continued sightseeing here on Kaua’i for 5 days before they were tested and confirmed.We have a resident population of about 70,000 - the number of people who can be affected here by infected tourists is horrendous.We have a total of something like 100 hospital beds and much less resources than the mainland generally does..This is a pandemic - unless you have to come here - please postpone it.Malama Pono,Janet"
"The sad part is all the small businesses on Kauai that will close for good because of this. Many of the employees (and some of the business owners themselves) work pay check to pay check and if the business isn't taking in $$$ those folks will be out in the cold.All those beautiful little mom and pop stores and food venues and restaurants, etc that we love so much will be gone for good.As we all know Hawaii is 100% different than the mainland, it survives by ""tourism"", (i.e. tourists disposable income), no tourism, no $$, no businesses. Not too mention how once the tax revenue dries up from the lack of tourist how CRAZY expensive it will be for the locals. The state isn't going to cut their budget, they still need to pay for all the police and fire men, road work, etc.So sad."
The Governor of Hawaii is encouraging people to cancel nonessential travel. https:/…Sad but these are tragic times. Businesses are going to close everywhere.
"Well, Fran....you really don't understand. Just like before, yes--some businesses will fail. Others will make it.Government workers will be furloughed and/or forced to take pay cuts. Again, it's happened before. Nothing new and they will do it again. Private businesses will do the same thing, if they are larger and can.Edited: 2:05 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"While not eating in restaurants, we are still getting take-out meals from our favorite local restaurants to support them. I know others are as well. Trying to help them in any way we can without making the situation worse. Life will go on, and we will get through this."

"Seriously? FYI,it's against TA guidelines to business in the forums."
"We are supposed to go on Saturday, March 21 too and are SO torn as to what to do! Planned this trip 7 months ago! Booked Marriott hotel with the lower point levels and now that they've raised point levels as of March 4, we'll get less value toward our hotel to reschedule. Frustrated at that too!"
I feel for you. I was planning to go to Kauai to celebrate my late mom's upcoming 80th birthday in her honor and now I'm feeling that we won't be able to go. All the best with your decision. I know it's a very tough one but I guess best to be safe if that's what prevails with the tough decision.
"I think this is a no brainer, Pam. Given the rapid unfolding of events, the restrictions advised, the potential issues, the anxieties surrounding travel at this time AND the fact that you'd be visiting your 80yo mother...well. There you go. ~ Colleen"
I thought S.F was on a lock down . Are people allowed to travel to airports ??
"Since it's your ""late"" mom's birthday......I don't think she will mind that you honor her from home.Please.......STAY HOME. Don't bring this thing to other places and people."
"Echoing AkamaiNick . . . PLEASE stay home. It's not responsible to travel here for pleasure right now; there's too much risk that you could carry COVID-19 to a place with an already limited health care structure. Remember, people can be infected and spread the virus even if they are completely asymptomatic! So ""not feeling sick"" isn't a valid reason for nonessential travel."
"Not yet. Our trip isn't until April 27-May 11, but the way things are going it's not looking good. This is our 40th Anniversary trip. We are supposed to visit Kauai, Oauhu and Maui. It's been planned since last summer. I been saying to my husband for months,I can't actually believe we are going to Hawaii. So sad, so unfortunate but we don't want to go if things are closed and people are not allowed out like normal. Also being safe and smart about this is a good idea. All I can say is thank God for trip insurance!"
"It is not clear that trip insurance will cover cancellation from a concern about corona virus. If you actually have the virus, that would be different. Of course, it all depends on the (usually strictly enforced) policy language. And if you have ""cancel for any reason"" coverage, you should be OK.If people in Hawaii want to discourage travel to the islands at this time, owners of accommodations (hotel, rental condos, etc) should offer refunds or liberal rescheduling. Otherwise, inevitably there will be people who travel anyway because they have already spent what is, for some, ""once in a lifetime money."""
"Here's the unknown side of that ""come because I spent the money""............medical bills if you get sick; insurance coverage for medical, related costs, repatriation, and evacuation.The assumption that if you visit you WILL stay healthy decreases in reality every day. Most people are already infected before they land here."
"Plus there is the distinct possibility travelers will spread the virus to people they know and to those they don't know. If getting sick doesn't worry someone, do they care about others?If not, who will care about them? Don't expect a GoFundMe page for help, I went on vacation because I am young and now my parents and nephew with CF are in intensive care.Edited: 2:43 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Cancelling. Heartbroken and sad but we'll be safe. No idea if/when we can reschedule given many dynamics. Sure I'm not alone!
Cancelling. Guess this trip was sadly not meant to be.
"Pam, MANY Mahalos for doing the smart and better thing.Hawaii will still be here when this is over."
"You are not alone. I have been going back and forth with the owner of our condo on Kauai through VRBO who is refusing my request to reschedule so that we don't lose all this money. He is standing by his policy, refusing, telling me to use my best judgement on how to proceed. In addition to it being completely irresponsible to travel and potentially unknowingly bring the virus to the island, take away resources from folks that live there , not be able to get home etc. I am in Northern California where we are on a shelter in place...Can't travel even if I wanted to. I'm still hopeful that he will do the right thing as some owners are doing but I am not optimistic. Being an owner who rents our home in Tahoe on VRBO, I would never not issue a refund or allow someone to reschedule if they had bookings with me now, or months from now. It's just the right thing to do. Not allowing guests to rebook or be at all show some flexible certainly will not help anything...It's frustrating to say the least..."
"Pam, I'm sorry I misread your earlier post re your late mom. I think you made the right decision to cancel ~ and no, you aren't alone. The toughest thing for me about canceling our trip elsewhere is the full-on cancellation aspect, rather than rescheduling. It'd be easier if at least there was something to look forward to, another trip to plan. Sigh. So frustrating that people like FunJunky are dealing with owners who won't even allow a rebooking, or to at least negotiate. ~ Colleen"
"For those have been allowed to reschedule for later. Are the owners allowing just a 1 time reschedule. What if you reschedule to August and things haven't improved by then. Would they allow to reschedule again? Also, by rescheduling the owners keep your current payment (full amount) and applies towards the future trip?. What if the rental agency is no longer in business and we are outside of the chargeback period."
No! We are going mid-April to 30 April.
"I cancelled my April 26 trip and was pleasantly surprised that my Airbnb host, who has a 'strict' cancellation policy, refunded my deposit 100%. Waiting to see if hawaiian airlines is as lenient."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!A big heartfelt mahalo to those individuals who have canceled their trip here.Things are SO much worse than they were when this post was started!If you haven’t already- PLEASE cancel or delay your trip until this worldwide emergency is under control!I am in somewhat the same boat - MY vacation is bought and paid for and is also a “once in a lifetime” trip - but it isn’t until October so I haven’t taken any action and I hopeI do not have to. But if it was this month or the next two months at least - I would certainly cancel. It is incredibly selfish to travel when we are told no “non essential” travel is what we should be doing.There are many kupuna (elderly) here. People in Hawai’i look after their kupuna. Please don’t add to the already dangerous situation they - and other residents are in.Also - things are closing here every day as this progresses.Please do the right thing.Malama Pono,Janet"
"@PatC Good luck dealing with Hawaiian Airline. They charge us $200 per ticket for cancelling our flight, even though we are being told to practice ""social distancing"" to avoid the spread of Covid-19."
Fees and changes depend on when the flights are.
"Yes Alaska Airlines is offering cancel or change dates for free, but only if booked through April. Since we are supposed to come in May, we miss that offer. Hoping as it gets closer, if still in chaos then, they will include those dates after April."
"It should not matter when your flight is scheduled. There's a cdc (50), state (25) and federal (10) guidance that states crowd limit to help control the spread of coronavirus. Everyone should get full refund and not the ""no change fee"". On top of that, most like they will receive another government bailout money."
"My good friends are scheduled to be there in early April. They booked a condo through VRBO and want to cancel. The owner says no to a reschedule or refund and VRBO won't help at all! Meanwhile AIRBNB has offered a refund to everyone worldwide who wants one! VRBO, this is going to cost you and your parent company Expedia for MANY years. We will not forget and intend to remind the public regularly!"
"Nick, saying that ""Most people are already infected before they land here"" sounds very incorrect to me. Can you point to any data that even remotely proves your claim? Hysteria does not help anyone."
"The tests and cases prove it. Only yesterday did we have our first homegrown case. All the others came with their owner, just like baggage."
"Oh, and don't be so quick to praise Airbnb...they asked the Feds for money today."

I read it on a third party news website but I'm not seeing it on the official press release. I am trying to edit my post to reflect this. My general point definitely still stands!
"I mean no offense to any of you, but as of today Governor Ige urged tourists to refrain from flying to Kauai for the next 30 days. We have also shut down bars and county parks, and restaurants are strictly take out, with many of them closing completely. This is NOT the place where you should quarantine as we are experiencing shortages of groceries and other resources as it is. This is not the place to escape. We are running out of Aloha for those of you who insist on doing so against the warnings of many."
"Hawaii does not need the stress of tourists when there is a shortage for the residents. The people who actually live there should not have to compete for necessities and God forbid if one of you gets sick you are taking up precious health care that is in dire need.Taking a vacation to Hawaii during this outbreak is selfish and inconsiderate. The President, the governor of Hawaii, and the local people could not be clearer, Tourists are not welcome at this time. This is not ""business as usual"" the island can not handle more people! Stay home."
"Just curious if you're still going through with your trip to Kauai?We haven't cancelled yet, but fly in 48 hrs and I'm definitely on the fence."
"Mary, you should cancel. The governor advised that you cancel."
Only idiots would electively enter an airport right now.
"I hear you. We own a timeshare and they will only let us rebook 60 days or less in advance, which will prove challenging for us given work, schedules, getting inexpensive flights and the ability to get a reservation in the first place. Most likely this will mean that we will not get back into a Westin Hawaii property for our trip this year. Still the right decision to cancel but very frustrating all the way around. I hope the property you booked into will realize that their policy is ridiculous! Vistana (Westin timeshare owner) could do better too!"
Thanks for this info. Tough for all of us. We'll stay away from Kauai until we can return--which may not be for a LONG time given cancellation and rescheduling policies that also make it difficult to go there in the future. Stay safe!
Sure. Not fun for any of us right now. This is SO surreal.
"Nick, nothing ""proves"" your statement. At best it is a gross misunderstanding of the facts as we currently know them. At worst it is a lie. Your statement was ""Most people are already infected before they land here"" -- that is factually incorrect. It's not open to interpretation, it's wrong."
As of this morning VRBO has posted that they will refund their fees to those scheduled to travel between March 13-April 30th and that they have let owners know that they should be allowing guests to reschedule their dates or cancel and get at least a 50% refund. Of course when I reached out to the owner of our condo at HBR he spoke with VRBO this morning and he is not required to do anything and will not do anything...so it continues and we will be going to our credit card company to see if they will help...
"FunJunky, I'm sorry to hear that you have to deal with such an inconsiderate owner! I can't understand why the owner is acting so unreasonably in this situation. I hope your credit card company will help you!"
"Not sure what your hostility at me is about, Traveler. The people diagnosed were linked to cases and COVID-19 contacts ON THE MAINLAND AND IN GERMANY................so yes, they brought it with them and the incubation was already going.SW"
"Nick, there is no hostility. Please read the sentence I quoted, and read your entire post. You are stating that most people are already infected before they land. Most people are not infected anywhere -- not on the mainland, not on Kauai, not on an airplane. Read your own words, you made an inaccurate statement. If you intended to say that the two people who had COVID were infected before arriving, you should have chosen those words."
Here's media coverage saying not to go: (sorry!)https://www.sfgate.com/news/education/articl…Sad to say but we cancelled.
"What I said:""The tests and cases prove it. Only yesterday did we have our first homegrown case. All the others came with their owner, just like baggage.""Have a great day! And please DON'T visit Kaua'i or anywhere in Hawaii.SWEdited: 10:35 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"FunKunky, you are correct. VRBO has sent out a memo to all listors on their site RECOMMENDING they give full refunds OR a full credit. The next option is only a 50% refund and the worst option is they give nothing back.But here's the deal...... Vrbo can only SUGGEST something. They cannot force the listors on their site. What they can do and they are saying they will do...... is it will hurt their listing's ""presence"" on the site. In other words, how high up the ladder they are when a person searches.It's also important to recognize that Vrbo has this policy and recommendations in place for now up until April 30th (for reservations that have even just one night within that period). So who knows what will happen with reservations after May 30th. They could be singing a different tune by then. They're making no promises that far into the future and if they won't put the heat on their owners for June reservations and beyond you might not see owners and agents listing their being so generous.Only time will tell."
"Yep, Napaguy, I'm aware of all of that, we are owners too. I just spent some quality time on a chat with a VRBO rep. They will record the complaint and will reach out to the owner but it really is all up to the owner to do what they will. Interested to know how they will ""monitor"" and identify those owners who are being more accomodating and those that are not (like ours) they say that they are tracking it. At the end of the day it is what it is...I know that we are not alone in this..."
"Nick, what you said is exactly what is in my quotes. You are reading the wrong post. I'm not re-interpreting your words, they are exactly your words. Anyway, I'm not going to try and get you to correct yourself any longer. Aloha."
"I have no idea why my post was deleted..........as I said nothing wrong.Whatever--some people here just want to argue and attack. And tacking ""aloha"" onto the end doesn't work, sorry.As I have said THOUSANDS of time in the last 6-8 weeks.....PLEASE don't visit now. PLEASE don't spread this anymore than it already is being spread. Hawaii really will still be here when this is all over.SWEdited: 6:16 pm, March 18, 2020 "

"If you haven't cancelled, you should. The Mayor of Kauai announced a mandatory curfew from 9pm to 5 am, and said visitors should not be traveling to Kauai for recreational purposes. The State government is working out the details of mandating a 14day home quarantine for everyone coming to the state (with exceptions for health care workers or essential employees."

"""If SEA if still open, end of April, we'll go""What don't you people understand??!! Visitors are not welcome in Hawaii. This will not change in a month or 2. You are being so selfish and disrespectful. This is just not okay. I was starting to feel sorry for all the people who lost money, but now I just think you deserve it.STAY HOME."
"I’m trying to imagine why anyone would want to go in the near future. A locked down, unwelcoming island with extremely limited supplies and medical resources doesn’t sound like a place to willingly visit.The sunk costs of a lost condo rental? Wow.Thank goodness the powers that be won’t allow it."
"Why not contact the agency or owner, and try to work something out?? Why risk yourselves and all of the people near you when you don't even know your options?Please, don't be selfish and endanger yourself and everyone around you."
"Since people want to keep going to Hawaii while the residents are dealing with supply shortages, etc. The next move should be a mandatory shut down of all vacation rentals and ban all rental cars. Disrespectful people will have no where to stay and no car to rent.The state obviously cannot count on people to do the right thing and STAY HOME."
Go to the airlines first. They are getting bailouts. No one going to Hawaii unless you’re a resident or homeowner and you need to take care of your home.
"""I was starting to feel sorry for all those people who lost money but now I think you deserve it""...Wow, really? For those few people who are saying ""I'll still go"" I think that there are way more people that are staying home and doing the responsible thing, eating their losses after trying to reason with and work with owners who are not budging on giving anything back...Never would I come to Hawaii or anywhere now (I'm in CA where the entire state is locked down), but I don't appreciate being told that ""I deserve it"" either...sheesh."
"Hi, as a person who cancelled her trip a week ago, I feel your pain! And I'm surprised at the people on this and other threads who literally SHOUT at us to STAY HOME...we aren't stupid, we just haven't been able to wrap our heads around the severity of the situation fast enough. Today I was supposed to be flying to Kauai. I woke up to my phone telling me ""TO KAUAI"" and it made me sad, but I also laughed to think that just a week ago I actually thought I was going to make it! What a joke! Of course we cancelled. But up until we did it, part of me thought we could go. My brain works that way right now. Something I thought was OK yesterday is suddenly an absolute NOPE today. So, that's that. Trip postponed until mid-August. Or possibly longer. If we don't have a turnaround in the next 2 months we may not have any jobs or money left to take a vacation."
"Karina.....sorry for shouting--because, yes, I have sometimes. I'm not apologizing for anyone else shouting.I wish people would get and read more closely though. It's sooooo frustrating when people say it, say it, say it....and still, people ask again or ignore again. I would not plan on August. Seriously (and not shouting!). This is just getting started and is very likely to run much longer than first thought/hoped.SW"

"To those of you who have been very repetitive, and in some cases quite impolite, in expressing your views that people should not travel to Hawaii this spring, or summer, or even fall, you should understand this: Many of us who read this forum really do not care what your opinion is about whether we should, or should not, travel, nor do we care about your wild speculation concerning how long this coronavirus crisis will last. If you can provide factual information that the rest of us might not have -- such as news about what is going on in Kauai these days, or local rules and governmental orders, or hotel and rental agents refund policies, etc. -- that is great and can be quite helpful. But your opinion -- no matter how emphatically, loudly and repetitively stated -- just does not matter to most of us. We are smart people who are able to make our own decisions. You may agree or disagree with those decisions -- that is fine -- but each of us will make our own decisions. (In many cases I suspect that decision will be to cancel, for trips coming up soon, and to wait and see for trips a bit further out -- but whatever the decision is, I really don't need some random stranger on the internet telling me what I should do)."
Bravo! onekbear
"I guess if the fact that there are not enough supplies on Kaua'i to take care of the people that live there, or enough medical personnel or hospital beds to take care of the people that live there. Then you do not care about the people of Kaua'i. These people that are planning to take ""a vacation"" which will put a strain on these things (FACT) makes them undesirable tourists at the very least. I guess we just can't convince a selfish person to care."
"Well, that's really special! Slam people who live here, have been posting links, info, articles, etc., etc. for weeks--sometimes more than a month already.I can tell you what conditions are here--doesn't that matter? I can tell you how people feel here. Doesn't that matter? I can tell you what isn't published by the PRO TOURISM people, be they here on TA or in most of the media.Wouldn't you do the same if I was visiting-or proposing to visit-your home in times like these? Or would you just let me bumble along, dumb and blind?How about all the ideas and help we've given people on agencies, owners, refunds, schedules, flights, restaurants, stores, locations, tours, etc.? Does none of that matter?And BTW---the quarantine is a go as of March 26th. Just being announced. HAWAII IS CLOSED.Edited: 9:12 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Watching our Governor speak now. Mandatory 14 day quarantine for anyone coming to the state, both residents and visitors. Kicks in on Thursday, March 26 at 12:01 am. It was deemed necessary as the state is still receiving over 20,000 visitors per day. Residents quarantine at home, visitors quarantine at hotel or lodging. They are going to track it using the visitor forms. Can't leave your room, have to call 911 if you begin to have respiratory issues and they will decide if you qualify for medical treatment. More details as they come out. $5000 fine if you are found in violation."

We all suffer from them, some more than others. I’m thankful for those who take a moment to enlighten me when I need it."

"I can't wrap my head around those who can't ""wrap their head around"" the virus spread.And still, no one who is h3ll bent on going to HI, has posted as to why, with all the closures and attitudes right now, would they even consider taking a vacation.

"Frank, many thanks for your consideration. SW"
"onekbear: a couple of plain facts for you-Governor David Ige announced tourists refrain from visiting for 30 daysMayor Derek Kawakami instated an island wide curfew, permit-only access to beaches, and a mandatory 14 day quarantine on arrival or a $5,000 fine."
"Reading this thread from start to finish (what else is there to do when one is just sitting at home all day?) was interesting for me. Everyone on page one saying they were going, on with show.I booked my vacation about six days before this thread, and basically never came back to the forums. Today I posted my own personal thread about if I should cancel an October trip. After some consideration I did just that.My trip insurance has a 30-day look provision and I have until early April to cancel. They said their lines are swamped and suggested an e-mail. That has been sent today.Our condo was VRBO. I actually worried about any trip issues and purchased a condo with a pretty decent cancellation policy. We had until late summer to get 100% back. Today I used the VRBO website to initiate that cancellation.Delta is allowing us unlimited changes fee free changes so long as we travel by the end of Feb. 2021. We can also cancel for free and get a credit of the amount we paid and have to travel before early March. I'm letting the flights stand as is and if they make serious changes, it is likely (but not necessarily) they will just refund the cost of the flights.I will update once I receive my refunds. I'm hoping for no issues."
"Bellyqueen asked why I would read the threads if I do not put stock the opinions expressed here about what other people should do regarding their planned vacations. The answer is I read the threads because they contain interesting and useful factual information. One example of that -- among many others -- is the information CarlyJ posted in #214 above. I knew those facts already because others had posted them, but it is an example of information that I find helpful. But when someone simply expresses their opinion about what others should do, and particularly when they do so in a hostile way or using accusatory language -- I don't find that useful at all. I don't know who you are, so I have no idea whether I should value your opinions or not. And if you express yourself in a loud, hostile, demeaning or accusatory way, then I assume your judgment is probably unsound. But if you provide useful factual information, that is different. At least as I see it."
"#215/Ravekid — Your strategy of waiting to cancel your airplane tickets is a good one. Delta’s contract of carriage allows a full refund with no penalties if airline schedule changes result in a departure or arrival variance greater than 60 minutes. As you mentioned, with all the schedule changes airlines are making it’s very likely that you’ll see a refund eligible change before October."
"onekbear,I give people who live in an area some leeway given these circumstances. If they were just complaining about tourist traffic, I'd laugh. However, this is different. This virus causes SARS and it appears to spread a lot faster than the flu. Say this new virus only kills half the people as influenza, but it kills them six times faster. So while it might only kill half the people the flu does over the course of twelve months, COVID-19 will kill all those people in just two months. So all the sick will flood the hospital system at nearly the same time.I don't believe numbers in China. Italy and Spain though I trust. They are now in the hundreds per day dying. Hopefully Italy has reached their peak, they went from 793 deaths in one day to 651 deaths the next day.Hawaii should've shut down even sooner. Closed all ports. It might actually be too late. The next two weeks will determine if that is the case.I don't believe for a second anyone here would be OK with folks bringing SARS to their general area. We should try to limit the spread the best we can.Badger,Thanks for the info. I just read the contract. Looks like it is now 90 mins.. But they also have a few out clauses that could give them a pass. Guess I'll see what happens later. Right now I'm hopefully we can deal with the new virus and I can re-book my trip.Edited: 4:29 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"More facts for @onekbear:There is now a mandatory 14-quarantine for anybody arriving in Hawaii, starting 3-26. For those tourists who are so uninformed or unwise as to decide to travel at this time (and into the unspecified future), you will be on lockdown in your hotel room or rented lodgings for the full two weeks. Canʻt even go outside to get food; the only exceptions are for seeking medical care or leaving the island to fly home."
"Ravekid, my thanks to you!!! You said it very well.SW"
"I understand locals in Kaua'i are becoming more and more vocal, carrying signs, and protesting against tourists arriving.One of the comments in the newspaper said it best.""Visiting Kauai during a pandemic, if you don’t need to be here, is now a hostile gesture, and it deserves a hostile response."""
Do you think maybe there has always been a bit of a love/hate relationship between locals and tourists — “we like your money but we would otherwise prefer that you didn’t exist” — which the current circumstances are bringing to the fore?
Well said.
"""Do you think maybe there has always been a bit of a love/hate relationship between locals and tourists — “we like your money but we would otherwise prefer that you didn’t exist”Sure, but it goes deeper. There are many, many off-island vacation rental owners. They have the best of both worlds. They get income from their rental properties and they are not there stuck in traffic, waiting in lines, and living in neighborhoods that have turned into mini resorts with hoards of tourists.Local people who are trying to live in peace and raise their families will always have a different view."
"We're scheduled for a May 3rd (we've visited every May for 24 years) trip to Kauai. We have no intention of going for reasons that are beyond obvious. At this point, the property management company is allowing folks to rebook through April 30th. I'm sure this will be extended. If not, we're out $3500. That's a lot of money to us! But, honestly, we're much more concerned with the livelihoods and health of the Kauai residents. We send our respect and best wishes to you all."
"""Do you think maybe there has always been a bit of a love/hate relationship between locals and tourists — “we like your money but we would otherwise prefer that you didn’t exist” — which the current circumstances are bringing to the fore?""Even amongst us locals there are always varying degrees of feelings with regards to tourists. We know that unfortunately they are our life line. I say unfortunately because many of us still carry the burden of generations past, where we were once a kingdom and the blatant rape of our lands all to turn a profit. Now we have no choice.For me, I love tourism I don't mind it at all. However, there are many who aren't even from here ( and im not talking about large corp hotels) who capitalize on our tourism $$$ even when they aren't residents here. Call it the American dream what have you. I don't always blame the tourist for doing certain things that makes us locals go bat s crazy, it is the companies ( many again foreign owned) who capitalize on locations and activities that even us locals can't enjoy anymore.I remember when I was a kid enjoying Lani Kai Beach, now you can't really because it's super packed and you have to maneuver yourself around yards of Tulle and Fabric because some Japanese couple is posing for pictures right where you're laying down . but those are things we need to all work out.With regards to Covid19 and why locals feel the way they do, is because : 1. We are the most isolated group of islands in the world. Once this spreads we can't drive from Cali to Vegas or what not. We are stuck here.2. Not trying to state the obvious, but the more the tourists have ""reasons"" to come here during a Pandemic ( ie. super duper cheap airfares) they will come. And with them the possibility and probability that they may be carriers. 3. Those that did come in during the mandatory quarantine upon arrival, ARE NOT quarantined . There are videos everywhere with them gathering and gallivanting .. So epic fail. Now, I'm sure people will say that the majority of those infected are, in actuality, local. YES that is true. Because like the tourists trying to come here and feel fearless, they too did not take the necessary precautionary advice and NOT travel. I'm so sad to see it happen. Nobody wants their countrymen to be ill, but wtf .... Now we are trying our best to mitigate the problem, and with tourist still f'n coming it is not helping. I am hoping for and for see in the very near future, a mandatory Stafford Act lock down for the entire country. Maybe that'll help"
Thank you Angelina for the very thorough and thoughtful response.
"It has been said already, but folks may over look it. There is a mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers to Hawaii. It makes no sense at all to come for a visit. It may not make sense to come right now even if you live here."
We have a family trip planned for Kauai on july 11th. We are trying to figure out if it is best to cancel and rebook for next year. We are a large extended group of 15 and we rented 3 houses. Thanks!
"To #229: I think even for July you should assume curfew and quarantine will still be in effect. That would also mean each group remaining in its own home and your large group not being able to spend time together. It is unreasonable to expect the islands to be able to accommodate you this summer.Edited: 11:42 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"I live on Kauai, and during the local news this evening they were talking about recovery rates of various businesses in the state. Tourism was called out as taking the longest to recover, as the earliest travel measures for visitors are expected to get lifted is the end of July. Obviously not an official source, but that assessment would not surprise me at all with our stay at home order in place until at least the end of May even with low case numbers."
"Via Malama Mahaulepu organization, I was notified that Koloa Plantation Days has been cancelled although Kola Plantation Days official website does not yet indicate canceled."
