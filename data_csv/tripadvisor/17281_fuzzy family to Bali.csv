Am wondering how the Rabie epidemic of 2010 in Bali is now? I always travel with my GS dog and shes been on long bouts of boats/planes from Philippines to Hawaii and some times can ride with me. Will be coming to Bali for an extensive stay sometime in 2014 and have to bring my fuzzy other half. Any input and help on this matter will be appreciated much. Mahalo
Are you serious?
Hi Debhi50Can't advise on how the rabie epidemic is but the best advice is to get all the required shots for yourself & your dog :)Edited: 6 years ago 
I'm not 100% sure if this is still the case but I don't think you can take dogs into Bali. I know if you can get them in you will never get them out again. Leave your furbaby at home in a suitable boarding kennel or with other family members.
"Searched the net for some info, found this: http://www.pettravel.com/immigration/Bali.cfm""Regulations for taking a pet dog or cat to BaliDue to a recent rabies incident, Bali is not permitting the entry of any pets, even those from rabies free countries. Updates will be posted when we receive them."""
Mahalo It does not look or Seem llike its at all very possible. I know when i left Philippines to come back home to Hi we had to do all the Paper work and shots/blood test etc and all in a certain time frame for entering Hi. I actually got my GS dog in the Philippines from a german man. Again many thanks for your reply! Blessings to you!
Thats what i was wondering......The Now UpDates.....Thank you! Blessings
"Thanks for your reply. I think its from what i can find, still the case No animals....I never have come across not being able to Leave with them if you do have them. I appreciate your reply! Blessings to you"
Many Thank you's! i have been reading a lot and just found a site (may be the one you just gave me) and it seemed to be the Only Updated one but still did not say if any dogs where Yet being let into Bali. Blessings and again Mahalo!
