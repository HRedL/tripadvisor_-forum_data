We have rented a house on the beach near Parrita for February next year on Playa Palma. We'll rent a car and do lots of sightseeing. Any ideas? Restaurants? Fishing guides? Would appreciate any input!!! Thanks 
"Ok, Playa Palma is also know as Playa Bandera, the beach is very dangerous, be very carefull when you go into the water. Restaurants arenÂ´t many around. You can do a day trip to La Pilas waterfalls in Playon de Parrita, this is about 20km from bandera. About fishing guides is better if you come to Quepos to charter a fishing boat or you can ride in a little panga with one of the local fishermans if you speak spanish. And for sure please do a good guided tour of Manuel Antonio National park, you will love the park and all the animals. NATUREGUIDE"
"the las pilas waterfalls are a great place and you could also do the canopy tour at sky mountain canopy the same day as they are only 3kms apart. there is a good resteraunt just 1km north of the entrance to playa bandera called Huetar. I am a fishing guide in quepos and live in parrita and dont know of any fishing guides in that area. The river parrita in feb is a great river to do some wade fishing for machaca, roncadore and snook. the beach is fairly safe in feb , this coincides with our smallest waves of the year, just use some common sence. The north end of bandera has a small river mouth that can provide some good surf fishing if you bring your own gear."
"Dengue Fever quite common in Parrita there was anepidemic there last fall involving hundreds and some tourists.www.medtravelhealth.com Costa Rica Dengue Feveruse lots of repellent and insect precautionsbe sure your house has screens AC and/or netsHave fun,"
"A lot of people that works in Manuel Antonio lives around Parrita, just a little town...good for grocery shopping...beaches are not very safe...but nice sunsets..Just buckle up and enjoy the ride in PARADISE!"
What do you mean the beaches are not safe? Please explain
"Fredirving - I can't speak for Roadadvisor, but I assume the danger he is referring to is the riptides. Many of the Pacific beaches have very strong riptides and Playa Bandera is known for its strong current. As with most beaches, there are no lifeguards. Be cautious and watch the locals to see where it is safe to go in. "
We are staying at Makanda from Aug. 22 for a week...we are looking for a local fishing guide...if your interested send us your rates & local phone # to get in touch with you...there will be 2 people fishing. Thanks! My email address is txhunter_72@yahoo.com
