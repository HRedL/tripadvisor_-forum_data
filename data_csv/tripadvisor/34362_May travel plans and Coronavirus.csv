"Hello fellow travelers,We are traveling to Isla with a group of 11 in late May. Airfare purchased, house rented...and ugh. The Coronavirus. We are all following the news and trying to understand potential impacts and how we might mitigate financial losses should this continue to snowball into May canceled flights from the US to Mexico. From what I understand, travel insurance likely isn’t the answer, because we’ve had this booked for so long. Is anyone else in our same boat? What are you doing? Suggestions and recommendations beyond frequently washing our paws?"
There are only 2 confirmed cases in all of Mexico.
May is a long time away and I would just go. This virus is being blown out of proportion. And it's in the US now so you are just at risk here in the US as you are in Mexico. Take your trip have fun!
"I think it'll get worse before it get's better. Right now, it's not a big issue."
The same concern is on my mind as we look toward June. I suggest checking with your airline and trip insurance company to see what their policies are in regards to concerns about the virus.
Probably the biggest risk is from airports and packed planes.
Ha! Less concerned about Mexico than US cases and airlines cancellations. I need the beach!
"Forget about travel insurance unless you purchased with Cancel For any Reason. We are booked for May also. Actually our daughter, SIL and grandsons are meeting us there for a few days. Unless the airline’s cancels we are going."
"You are renting and not at a mega resort with thousands of people and the dreaded buffets. That in itself is a safety plus...for any virus! I'm here now and it never crossed my mind not to go. All you can do is monitor the situation. I wouldnt do anything rash and just prepare for a wonderful time. I agree about wiping, especially the plane and washing hands but that goes for all the time.Edited: 1:22 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"I think the OPs concern is not a matter of whether to go or not, it is what happens if this escalates, and there are airline cancellations from the US into other countries or border closures. Trump literally said yesterday that he was considering closing the southern border (and then walked it back)."
"We don't have travel insurance for our March trip and so we are just going to wait and see. We don't save anything by canceling early so if things get bad, airlines might cancel their flights in which case we would get full refunds. (Crews were refusing to fly into some impacted areas which is another source of pressure on airlines.) Husband's work is requesting he cancel all non-essential international travel (or stay home for 14 days upon return) but that policy might change so we are just trying to stay updated and we are prepared to cancel if nec. We have 17 days to cancel our hotel but we are prepared to re-book those same dates if things change after that."
We had plans in early April but decided their was too many unknowns. I would keep an eye on the situation and make a decision a little closer to your travel date. Things are changing daily. Mexico may 4 cases right now but that's how it starts out.
"We are going on Sat Mar 7th for 1 week. I will be carrying hand sanitizer with me as always and possibly Lysol wipes for the plane mostly to attempt to avoid colds. I just read an article (maybe Wall St Journal?) where a doctor suggested taking cold pills with you and try to avoid getting sick (eg. colds, flu & get the flu vaccine which takes a month to be effective) because coughing etc could draw attention and you don’t want to be put in quarantine somewhere for a cold or flu!"
"We have an adult trip to Isla and Cancun booked for May and another family trip just to Isla booked in June. We purchased insurance for both when we originally booked, however, our insurance doesn't include cancel for any reason...which would be the only insurance you could get to cover for wanting to cancel for this reason. I work in healthcare and we are still more concerned about influenza at this point. Influenza season likely has just lasted it's peak season and hopefully we will see coronavirus begin to decrease also. We went thru a similar scenario several years ago with swine flu....we went to Mexico anyway. If airlines cancel flights, I'm sure they will have to give you credit or money back. Your accommodations may be another story. Depending on where you are staying and how you booked, there are tons of different cancellation policies very specific for every place. We are still planning on going. We are just as likely to get sick at home as we are in Mexico. Wash your hands, keep your hands away from your face, use wipes, cover any cough you may have. The only small tweak I am considering for our May trip, is possibly cancelling our AI in Cancun and just staying on Isla the whole time instead of splitting our stay. I booked my AI on Orbitz and have until mid April to decide for full refundable cancellation for that part of our stay."
We are also scheduled to go May 22-28th. We purchased Expedia’s vacation waiver...one time flight change or get airline credit with 100% refund for hotel. To bad I didn’t opt for cancel for any reason...oh well! We are going to wait the corona virus situation out couple of weeks out to leaving. Hopefully everything fizzes out by then. But don’t know if I would want to chance getting sick down there compared to being here.
"I disagree. If I have a choice on where to be quarantined for 2 weeks, I choose Isla."
"I think the concern is not so much that there are only a few cases in all of Mexico as of now. It is how the virus is spreading all over the world, the fact that thousands of travelers from all over the world will be in Isla, contained. As long as no cases are in the area,we are taking the risk next month. I would just hate to ever get sick out of the country and I hope this entire Coronavirus is blown out of proportion!"
"We all hope that this is another Y2K computer scare type situation, that largely turned into nothing. I'm schedule to attend the American Coatings Convention in Indianapolis later this month. I would guess that 5-10% of the attendees historically are from China, and 10% from Europe, plus a spattering of people from around the globe. There are rumors that the show will be cancelled, but we'll wait and see. Hell, it just dawned on me that I'm scheduled to travel and make sales calls on March 27 (the Friday before the convention) with a supplier from Bolagna, Italzy. Northern Italy is a bit of a Corona hot spot."
"We are leaving next week and have no plans to change anything unless the flight is canceled or there is a major outbreak in the area.It look like Delta may be waiving change fees for international flights. I scanned the page, but I didn't look at the details. We do have insurance, but it it would be easier to just change the flight through Delta.If there was a quarantine, just quarantine the whole island. Air drop tacos and beer every day, and we'll be fine."
"This is a question of managing risk.- No one knows how extensive this epidemic is now or may be in the future.- The ""official governmental sources"" are barely believable at best.- Given the vagaries that are possible, my suggestion is to overdo as opposed to undergo any reaction/preparation. I would use flight insurance. I would use medical insurance. I would plan for the worst and hope for the best.- All of this especially if you are over 60.Edited: 12:14 pm, March 03, 2020 "
".....that should read ""underdo"" as opposed to ""undergo"".(This autocorrect drives me nuts!)"
"Well we are scheduled to arrive May 13. After hearing about United cutting back international capacity (we are flying Delta) I wonder if there will be issues there. Yes we have insurance but it does not cover this issue. If Delta canceled our flight I'm assuming we our fare back. I'm not worried, the wife works in the medical field and at a local hospital. I'm more worried about that."
I would love to be quarantined in Isla!!!
I think Delta and other airlines are waiving change fees.

"typhoidjane, you wouldn't be quarantined to the island, but instead to the inside of your room."
"""I would love to be quarantined in Isla!!!""You wouldn't be ""quarantined in Isla"" you'd be quarantined in your hotel room. The key word is room . You wouldn't be quarantined in the hotel but in your room."
We are going at the end of April. No change of plans here. I will strap myself to the wing of the airplane if that's what it takes....
It's not Mexico. It's being in a plane. I usually go in May. No plans to go at this point. Will airlines be flying to Cancun in May?
"http://graphics.channelnewsasia.com/As previous posters suggest very few cases and cancelling might throw up different problems,we're currently in riviera maya ,airport was normal on landing."
"I believe the risk isn’t so much the virus itself, although that’s nothing to ignore, but the US govt shutting down international travel or airlines canceling flights"
Yeah my fear wouldn't be so much catching it either but what you said. Or being quarantined if one person in hotel or plane was ill.
I think the possible result of this pandemic is being seriously underestimated. A plane is a small cruise ship.
"I have 3 trips planned between now and mid June. Nashville in 2 weeks followed by Isla/Cancun in May and then back to Isla in June. As of now, I am not changing my plans."
"Today it has been reported that there is a dramatic increase in Uber drivers contracting Coronavirus in multiple cities in the US.Think about that.Karissa, I wish you well."
"Everyone check your flight tickets to see if they are still running your flight. I random checked our plane tickets from Seattle to Cancun and they dropped that flight. It kind of worked out in our favor because they stuck us on another flight a few hours later and instead of Denver we fly into Houston. Also they dropped the price for us over a hundred dollars. They gave us the choice of reimbursement or to reschedule flight times. Definitely would still like to go.Edited: 8:06 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Michael,Good point. Yes, I've checked and so far all my flights are still on as scheduled. My AA flight price dropped, but with Basic Economy, nothing much I could do to reap the benefits of that yet.We dealt with a similar scare in 2009 with the swine flu....went anyways and had a great time, no crowds."
"""We dealt with a similar scare in 2009 with the swine flu....went anyways and had a great time, no crowds.""I also went to Cozumel via Cancun at the height of the swine flu hysteria. The hysteria surrounding this event may exceed that of the swine flu.I believe that the deaths just in 2020 in the USA from the yearly flu is roughly 8000. Yet a few unfortunate deaths from coronavirus justifies all the nonsense mentioned like companies telling people they have to self-quarantine if they go to Mexico.If they want to save lives, have everyone work form home during the US flu season. No shopping. No going out in public.Before contemplating canceling a trip months away, give it time for the hysteria to drop after the media realizes that their role in this is not having the desired outcome."
Agree
You should stay safe and not worry by cancelling.
"that wont help you in the airports. good luck just heard from friend it is not good, scary and more illness then you think. I would cancell"
"You may have a problem, and worrying is not called vacation. I would think twice and wait till this is over. Its just the beginning and you will return sick,"
"@Curiosity - clearly you have an agenda. Your only posts on here and the Cancun forum relate to the Coronavirus. While YOU might not want to travel during this time (which is totally fine) - edicts like ""you will return sick"" really aren't warranted unless your are a clairvoyant working for the CDC?"
Agree Starr....
"I’m not trying to scare anyone or cause undo foment among the diehard travelers. Those of you who are convinced that nothing matters except travel to Isla right now, well, good luck, and you may be causing problems for unsuspecting others. My concern is with the older travelers who are particularly susceptible to Covid-19. The danger is not with Mexico or Isla … it has to do with the crowds in the International Airports, Immigration lines and the confined nature of the plane itself. As I previously mentioned, it is a small cruise ship. And the danger may not be with you personally, but whose germs you inhale or come in contact with along the way, and then transmit to someone who is at a higher risk for something nasty than you may be.I also notice that all unnecessary travel is being discouraged, and more that a few airlines are canceling international flights, Delta and American among them. I don’t know if any of these flights are destined for Cancun, but they are being cancelled for a reason. Once again, think about it. The stats change from minute to minute, all to the negative.This is only going to get worse before it gets better. Use Your Heads. Isla will be there when it’s all over.Edited: 1:32 pm, March 10, 2020 "
https:/…index.htmlI would continue to encourage you to educate yourself by reading the attached link from CDC regarding travel.
"If elderly folks who are at risk if they get coronoavirus or the normal flu want to travel, then perhaps they should not travel during the height of the flu season unless they take suitable precautions.I am skeptical that any flights to Cancun have been canceled since there is ZERO reason to do so from the US and Canada...maybe other countries as well.Cancel if you wish but don't let the hysteria from the media and some in these posts scare you."
"Karissa, your cited reference is comprehensive and should be read by anyone interested in furthering their knowledge about Covid-19.I found one reference particularly interesting:""Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues should avoid situations that put them at increased risk for more severe disease. This entails avoiding crowded places, avoiding non-essential travel such as long plane trips, and especially avoiding embarking on cruise ships.""Edited: 2:32 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"The reference to ""Flu"" always amazes me.There is a vaccine for Flu, and those that don't get it put themselves at unnecessary risk.There is no vaccine for Covid-19, and won't be for at least a year.As I mentioned, the threat of infection is not caused by being in Mexico; it has to do with the crowds encountered along the way, as well as the confined nature of the plane itself, as pointed out by the CDC article.A more thorough education about the entire subject is called for.It is also important to understand that the official ""Administration"" advisements have much to be desired, pertaining to accuracy and knowledge; a rather large grain of salt is advised.Edited: 2:39 pm, March 10, 2020 "
I was supposed to leave for a 2 week trip to Italy on March 27th which has now been cancelled. First thing I did was book a trip to Mexico- Isla and Cozumel. I'm not worried about it. Honestly the airports/planes have probably never been cleaner and sick people are not flying. I have not heard of any outbreaks in MX.
"""You can lead a horse to water .......""If it was just your life at risk, it would be on you .... but it isn't just your life; you are risking innocent others when you return from your germ-ridden ""have to go now"" trip. And it has nothing to do with Mexico (and you've got a lot of convincing to assert that Cancun Airport and the Immigration crowds are ""cleaner than ever"".)Edited: 3:00 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"....and BTW, many ""sick people"" don't know they are sick. They infect others, nonetheless."
"Bottom Line: The vast majority (virtually all) of legitimate health resources are convinced that the US’s comprehension of the state of affairs re: Covid-19 is lagging about 10-14 days behind that of the rest of the world. The assertion that we should not “let the hysteria from the media and some in these posts scare you” is that of an uninformed and purposefully ignorant segment of the population.The real question is, “Do You Want To Take The Chance?” in the face of overwhelming and constantly increasing evidence? And if you do, is it ethical to risk the well-being of others due to your ill-advised actions?Think."
"I am healthy enough to travel. I am willing to take the chance. Where my obligation begins (perhaps) would be to warn elderly folks, infant children, or ""at risk"" people upon my RETURN that I have recently traveled and exposure to nearly anything, including coronavirus, is possible. I do not need to limit myself or obligate myself to others who are also traveling - either by plane, ferry or other mode that may increase exposure, since those folks are already inherently taking the risk by putting themselves in that situation, not by me also being in that situation with them.I'm going the end of May unless my flight is cancelled. I will take the same reasonable precautions when flying as to avoid illness as I always do. I will alert folks who may find it necessary that I have traveled recently out of the country as I always do.To the poor OP, who just asked a simply question. My apologies . . ."
"Fine. Advise all you know who may be at risk when you return (or at least, those that you know of). As for the rest of the people you casually encounter, well, the heck with them; it's their responsibility to avoid ME.After all, nothing is more important than Soggy Peso (or pick any other superfluous reason for not putting off your trip for awhile).And my guess is that the OP was looking for just the kind of information that has been provided.Edited: 3:59 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"The OP wrote: “ Airfare purchased, house rented...and ugh. The Coronavirus. We are all following the news and trying to understand potential impacts and how we might mitigate financial losses should this continue to snowball into May canceled flights from the US to Mexico.”I would imagine if the airline cancels flights you should be able to rebook at some future date, and hopefully they’ll waive the fee. As for the house rental, the important thing is, what is the cancellation policy? Most hotels allow you to cancel with no penalty if in advance enough; what is the policy of the house you are renting?"
"You're right, TNY ... the main concern of the OP surrounded ancillary details of the booking itself, and I stand corrected.As concerned as I am about the implications of Covid-19, I allowed that to overtake the original request. Nonetheless, the information provided in subsequent postings by myself and others of knowledge is pertinent to the topic."
"Lol, that was not directed at you. I was just answering the OP."
It seems naive to think this won't hit us all sooner or later. Wash your hands and hope for the best.
"Ah!! World Traveller has a little political agenda too! Imagine that. Now I might take your advice with"" a grain of salt""."
"Canceling our trip for May 1st...it's a human petri dish...lots of people,food sitting out ,pools where no one gets out to use the bathroom...yeah were stacationing it!!!"
"According to Politico News, the State Department is about to announce a Level 4 Travel Warning...https://www.politico.com"
"We just left the island, they are starting to shut things down and the locals are being encouraged to stay home. Hopefully it gets better by May."
"According to our health minister, social distancing is likely to go on for months. I’m not counting on any travel until the fall. Those insisting on travel are not only jeopardizing themselves, but the lives of everyone they come into contact with."
"were going back to our house may 25th, i hope!!"
"In our experience you can purchase travel insurance anytime. I would call Allianza to confirm if purchased u will be covered for a big portion of the trip under these very unusual circumstances! We always purchase, better safe than break the bank. Good Luck We just returned from ISLA on 2 March."
Read back through this entire thread this morning. Pretty crazy how things have changed since the first posts at the beginning of March. I originally thought our trip for June 6th would be fine to go on. Now I would say there is a 99% chance that we won’t be able to go.
"If it gives you any sense of security.....Everything is really being managed well here on Isla. They are monitoring EVERYONE at the ferry, taking temperatures, cleaning hands, checking for symptoms. Taxis and buses are being sanitized.At this point the schools have been closed till April 20th , alcohol sales are banned, restaurants are closed for the most part.THIS MESSAGE ISN'T DESIGNED TO CAUSE ALARM.....Just to give you a little confidence in knowing that the government is insisting on keeping the island healthy and safe for residents and for tourists to return soon!The island community { as we all know } is so heavily dependent on tourism.....they really are taking this seriously and head on!I think by May you will be here, relaxed and enjoying beautiful Playa Norte without a worry in the world!"
I wish Cancun was doing that with the taxis and buses. The only thing the taxis are doing here is raising their prices and asking the city for a discount on gasdiesel blaming it on less people using taxis.
"You are an idiotEdited: 6:26 pm, March 26, 2020 "
"What prompted that post, Louise?"
"Louise, I'd like to know what prompted your post too. My post is the last before yours so I'm curious if it was directed at me for some reason."
"USA has not peeked yet! If the virus is confirmed on Isla it will spread fast. There will be no travel to Isla for May, June, July and maybe longer. STAY HOME and STAY SAFE!! Give this thing a chance to go away before any travel. Keep the people on this beautiful Island safe."
I am sure it was directed at the OP for asking about May international travel.
"I travel to the island quite frequently and believe the best spots are the ones owned by locals and enjoy my time there! However, I have friends who live on the island and have been informed that all businesses must be closed by 8pm. Local vendors are not allowed to sell their goods until the country decides it is safe to do so. All are asked to be in their homes before 9pm. This has put a huge damper on their ability to stay open since it’s affected their financial status. You could continue with your trip, however please keep in mind you may not be able to enjoy the island at its best!"
"What you have ""heard” is not true. There are no restrictions on businesses other than bars, night clubs and gyms and no curfew. There are few businesses open now because of the economic situation-if you are not earning money you can't buy anything, including gasoline. NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THIS POSTER'S ADVICE AND COME HERE NOW. And please don't spread rumors-there are enough of them here."
Not sure where everyone is getting their information but there are nearly 3500 cases and 200 deaths currently. I have friends in Isla who tell me there are no tourists now. Don’t be selfish and possibly carry the virus to them.
"I read your post. Did you ever go to Isla Mujeres, if so, how was it? I have plans to go July 5th but am debating."
"You can read the latest update on precautions being taken on Isla in the Riviera Maya Times 4/23/20. Masks, stay at home and social distancing in place. If you do not have cancel for any reason insurance you can probably cancel acomodation, If airline cancels flight you are entitled to a full refund by law. If you cancel flight you may have to accept a voucher depending on the airline. Not sure how enjoyable your vacation would be with restrictions in place. Also, Dr. Fauci head of communicable disease NIH only recommends absolutely necessary travel, not for vacations, etc.."
Non residents can not travel to the island currently.It's shut down.Contact the airline to arrange refund or voucher.The renter should offer you a credit for travel in the future if not a refund.Good luck. Stay safe and healthy.
"Hi Ashley A, we were scheduled to leave May 16, obviously that is not going to happen. American Airlines has been wonderful, we will be rescheduling our trip for next May. Also the place we were staying is also giving us full credit for our stay next year. Also as an extra, we sent our passports for renewal, which were received by government on March 3, we have not yet received our new passports so we would have been SOL had we been able to travel! We are now counting the days to Isla 2021!"
Boy were you wrong! Lol

"Isla woman you’ve noted there are no curfews and other things that are quite the opposite of the following:Thursday, the US State Dept.included Isla Mujeres & Q. Roo in its Covid-19 update for Mexico. Here's what it says about our island--""Only one passenger is allowed per vehicle. The ferry schedule has been reduced. The passenger ferry has only six routes per day to Puerto Juarez, and passengers must pass through a sanitizing station on either side. The car ferry has just two routes per day, and they are set one hour apart, rendering it impossible for Isla residents to bring their cars to Cancun to do shopping as there is not enough time between the routes to return the same day. The ferry crossing is to be utilized primarily for cargo trucks to bring products to the island."" Here's what it says about our state--""Authorities in Quintana Roo have instituted a daily curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. The use of face masks in public is mandatory. All businesses are closed except for those deemed essential. Those circulating for essential business must obtain a permit. Those lacking a permit will be stopped by police to verify their purpose of travel. Only one person per family may enter essential businesses. There may be a maximum of two people per personal vehicle. The Quintana Roo governor announced that vehicles with plates from outside states as well as those with provisional plates are not allowed to circulate within the state, unless they are carrying out an essential function and have received a permit from the state to circulate. Additionally, there is a general prohibition on private vehicle circulation on weekends. Alcoholic beverages may be sold only from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. from May 1 to May 31.(Note-this was just extended thru June 30). Officials may issue fines and/or arrest and detain individuals found to be in violation of stay at home orders.""In the general information, it warns of health screenings and temperature checks when arriving in Mexican airports, which could result in further screening & potential quarantine There are statistics about the increasing cases, and it says only essential activities & outings are allowed, that INM is operating in a reduced manner, and notes schools are closed.. Regarding hotels it says... ""On April 3, Mexican Tourism and Health officials instructed hotels to cancel new and existing reservations and close for non-essential business.Guests that require accommodation due to essential business activities are permitted to stay in hotels with a maximum occupancy of 15 percent and may be asked to provide an employer letter certifying the nature of their business. Non-resident foreign citizens currently in hotel accommodation must begin the process of returning home immediately. Individuals showing respiratory symptoms will be referred to health authorities.

Islawomans post was from March 29. A lot changed for isla in the last 2 mos. Really for all of us.
"Yeah, that was two months ago."
"How are the cases in Cancun now? I know what we see on the news, but that's the news. I ask as my husband and I have a trip planned for our Anniversary in December and I'm afraid to make any arrangements due to Covid. Just trying to get a feel of what's happening. Thank you,"
"Unfortunately the number of cases increases daily here in Cancun so much so that puts us at risk of going back to red which is the most restrictive with stay at home requirements and resorts and restaurants limited to 15% occupancy. Currently we are orange which allows for 30% occupancy. Isla Mujeres is also orange although they did have some of the red restrictions placed on them although they are considered to be orange. The cases there are increasing at a concerning rate as well. Hence the reimposition of some of reconstructive measures. Not everything is open in either place and beaches are closed to everyone on Isla. In Cancun resorts are allowing guests to use the beach in front of their tespective. Unfortunately I keep seeing where both tourists and locals are going to beaches such as Playa Tortugas and Playa Chac-Mool. Unfortunately this is only going to make it easier for Cancun to end up in the red again. If people can't act responsibly we'll all end up ""locked"" in our homes again.No matter what your opinion is on the beaches being closed they are closed. Violating that by going to Chac-Mool or Tortugas just gives the State more reason to designate us as red again. But that's today. Unfortunately there's no way to know what the situation will be like in December. Hopefully by then we'll be green in the stoplight and everything can reopen with some normalcy. But what that ""New Normal"" is going to look like is anybody's guess. And maybe we won't be green by then and it's wishful thinking on my part."
">> ""How are the cases in Cancun now?""Good information above.The municipality of Benito Juarez (where Cancun is located) is currently averaging 49 new cases per day. That's double the amount from when we were in a lockdown from March to May. Things began ro reopen in June, and the number of cases increased.I don't know if you know about the epidemiological risk colour code system here, but more was allowed to open when we changed from Red to Orange. With an increase in Covid-19 cases, we may return to Red and see stricter lockdown conditions.Many visitors have come & gone within the past month and said they had a good trip, but I wouldn't be making any plans until everything reopens (i.e. the colour code changes to Green)."
