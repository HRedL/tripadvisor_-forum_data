"Saw a news report from Boston (on TV) this morning showed a live interview with one of the couple that reported being sick after visiting the Bahia La Romana. They showed their toxicology reports on TV which confirmed that had gotten sick from pesticide poisoning, not alcohol. Can't confirm the other incidents but just showing that it might not all be the alcohol if not, for all incidents."
You do know Robert that even links or articles are not FACTS. Simply posting what a media source regurgitates is far from fact. But I mean you of all people should know this right ;)
"Thank you for the information. Do you think that's good news or bad news? I think it's good news in that some results are trickling in and this would seem to refute some big, widespread conspiracy involving alcohol. The bad news is I can forego drinking alcohol on vacation (if I absolutely must), but I can't not breathe. I don't know what to think of all this."
"Of course they do Robert. Of course they also want to hear, read your views. Will provide link once I find it. Sorry I didn't have time to videotape the interview on my way out the door... now just mind your business, not everything is about you."
"This isn't necessarily great news but it does shows that for those who tried to feed us the whole alcohol conspiracy theories and mafia and underground stuff.... well, some of those may actually be linked to this. Will try and provide a link to the interview which showed toxicology reports etc...."
"Is the same American couple whose doctor confirmed pesticide poisoning from Bahia, as reported before (last year's trip)? Or is it the British couple that returned from Bahia June 6 this year? Or is this a new (third) one?"
Sorry Robert. By posting links or articles it actually DOES reinforce what you think or believe. You dislike a country you've never visited and you continue to post articles that bash the DR. What a coincidence! You've been working overtime lately... you get an incentive from whoever is paying you or what?!
Is it the same American couple who doctor confirmed pesticide poisoning from last year's trip?Or the British couple that returned from Bahia on June 6? Or is this another one?
"Dan, don't mind him. He's got to say something about everything on every single post. He's trying to save the world."
"Slyguy yeah you're correct, just have to point out hypocrites when I see em. He is a prime example. Doesn't practice what he preaches but then expects to be the Trip Advisor White Knight. It is one thing to shed warning or light on recent tragic events. It is a whole other level to continue day after day. Hour after hour. Posting about these events which everyone is aware of. A simple Dominican Republic google search has them come up. There is no secret any more... which is good! Answers are needed for everyone (victim families, tourists, locals). Sadly there are those who want to be the next CSI Horatio and do all the crime work for everyone...because apparently they have all the facts and answers. But of course when you do ask the hard questions, they either scatter, provide some answer that has nothing to do with your question or just ignore it. I have legit questions that people seem to always ignore....Why only Americans?Why only in the last year or so? If illicit alcohol is to blame which has probably been around for longer than a year?Why not several more cases? I would tend to think the number of cases would be far greater. People assume just because we don't care or have some vested interest, when in actuality, we just want answers that are factual based and not speculation. Again, no one seems to of learned from Jussie Smollett."
"Well you wrote it Robert so it must be true! I mean it is on the internet....a wise president once said...""If it's on the internet, it must be true"". - Abraham Lincoln"
"Here is the link: https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2019/06/06/lea…The interview actually does date back a few days. However, I had not seen it and certainly not the medical piece. Although it is hard to follow everything on here with the numerous repost over numerous threads... if someone posted it previously then here it is again. If one or two didn't see it like myself, then it at least provides more info on this particular resort/incident for those of us that had not seen it. Interesting that it was aired this morning on Boston TV."
@ 8 & @ 10. It is the same American couple from Colorado who came forward after the other issues.
"Dan1mal83, here are some more why's:Why are the toxicology machines broke in the DR?Why the ineptness of medical tests with so many tourist visiting their country?Why did they blame heart attacks at first?Why the need of the FBI?Why the need of the World Health Organization?Why the blaming of eating and drinking to much?Why the blaming of the victims?Why the blaming of social media?Why not taking responsibility for anything?Why so many incidents in such a short time?Edited: 1 year ago "
"FMJ You are correct! Lots of questions without answers. Hopefully after a through investigation, most of these can be answered and shed more light as to what is going on. I am sure some of the TA CSI agents will be happy to provide the answers to all of them and then some! After all, they solved the mysterious deaths within weeks!"
"Foodman those were our questions exactly. I seem to fall in that "" demographic "" as well - 50ish, female, some pre-existing med issues ( recovery from Gamma Knife Radiation treatment on brain) so it was just not a good choice for us. I've got enough to worry about here at home."
"It’s a losing battle ,some are fighting ,when the best news they can sort of come up with is that “it may” not be the booze after all that is killing people “it may be “ the bad pesticide problem that is making people sick and killing them.Followed by ——drink on :-)As someone above proved who had watched the link carefully ,descriptions as to what you thought you heard or saw can often be different to what actually was said or seenThat is why links are important every time when you are trying to make a point of fact"
OMG Robert (even I can use CAPS)... I'm so glad you are there to review every....single... posts..... to ensure complete accuracy and make sure that every... one....of....us.... realizes that the DR isn't safe for everyone.... Please feel free to carry on to another thread now that you have provided your expert opinion once again.
So sly is that your way of saying that Robert was correct and you were wrong?If so you might want to say it in words people will understand.If you just attack the messenger when you are proven wrong you lose the ability for people to take anything you post seriously.
"I don't see how it's ""even more reason to be concerned"". It seems to me that if the cause is pesticides, then they can switch to a different type of pesticide. Better yet - make that type of pesticide illegal.It would also explain why there have been relatively few cases. Spraying that I have seen has been done around the perimeter of the resort. So rooms close to that may be affected, while rooms further away would be less likely to be affected. And I think the cases would be bunched up around rainy periods, where mosquitoes would be more prevalent.It would also indicate that it's not nefarious, whereas tainted alcohol would be.Mark"
In all fairness I do think it’s important to point out that the interview doesn’t show toxicology reports pointing to pesticide poisoning.
"Mark thank you for sharing your views . Still waiting for your answer to the below statement:7. Re: Censorship Warning on Tripadvisor Once Again Jun 17, 2019, 9:14 AMSaveDestination Expert Mark wrote*** But what I'm seeing is people skipping the investigation, the arraignment, and the trial, and going right to the convictionI think that is false information. I'll stand corrected should you provide proof of that statement."
"should be in the La Romana forum, not this one Punta Cana"
"Dan1mal83,""Why only Americans?"" - Americans make up the largest number of tourists at resorts. But we should not assume there were no sudden death of other nationalities that remain underreported. For example, there was a case of a young Russian couple who suddenly died in Bahia Punta Cana. Who's counting? ""Why only in the last year or so?"" - Because people started coming out about last year and media started reporting. But we should not assume everything was hunky-dory before. E.g., there was a government report of two resorts in 2005 battling a frightening norovirus outbreak for weeks, with transmission rate of 7% - did the public know? Nope, they didn't. There was a class action suit that tourists won against Bahia (I think in 2008?) - did the public know? Nope, none the wiser. ""If illicit alcohol is to blame which has probably been around for longer than a year?"" - Of course. But it's also possible that criminals became more brazen and less careful, or that the degree of proliferation of illicit alcohol increased.""Why not several more cases? I would tend to think the number of cases would be far greater."" -Not necessarily. Compare to similar recent deaths from illicit alcohol (in Mexico) and from botched fumigation (in Egypt) - it's a just a few dead bodies. Not everyone dies. (Doesn't mean it's safe to keep drinking in those places!)"

"Should not be different forums for Punta Cana and La Romana in the first place. It's a tiny island, why break AIs by location? Too many forums for such a tiny place. It's all the same Dominican Republic, with all the same resorts. They could have broken it into two forums - ""AI"" vs. ""non-AI"". :) Maybe keep Puerto Plata separate, since it's very different quality."
"""Why only Americans?"" -Americans make up the largest number of tourists at resorts. But we should not assume there were no sudden death of other nationalities that remain underreported. For example, there was a case of a young Russian couple who suddenly died in Bahia Punta Cana. Who's counting? 1/3 of 6,000,000 = 2,000,0002/3 of 6,000,000 = 4,000,000Simple math tells me there should be double for other nationalities."
Why did the DR tell the son of the woman who died that her baby was to be cremated or embalmed before leaving DR...is it so toxicology testing etc...couldn’t be done in US...I find that suspicious...Edited: 1 year ago

Post 29 is a good point but it apples to almost anything.We never know what is happening. You really think HIV began in 1980?We only know what is being reported.And things happening and the reports of things happening can often be two completely different things.We had no idea in 1979 what AIDS was.That does not mean there was not plenty of AIDS before 1979.And after so many years have passed and no good record system we will never know. Next year at this time things will look a lot better for the DR or things will look like an ongoing and bigger disaster.Time will tellNone of us now have a clue which it will be.

"so, this came across my work desk today - this stuff is getting REAL :-) (at least in my evidence based world). Not only do we have the forum detectives on the case, but now ProMed is beginning to report the issues. I was not aware (as per this forum anyway) of a massive outbreak at Rui Palace Maco, but I may not have seen in in the multiple posts here, so apologies if old news.

BugsA ProMED-mail postProMED-mail is a program of theInternational Society for Infectious Diseases Date: Sat 15 Jun 2019, 1:03 PMSource: New York Post [edited]A group of Jimmy Buffett-diehards from Oklahoma were incredibly sick in paradise -- the latest in an ever-growing list of tourists to be sickened during a jaunt to the Dominican Republic, a report said.DF, a travel agent who vacationed to Punta Cana with the Buffett-loving Central Oklahoma Parrothead Association, said 4 days into their April [2019] trip, he and other members came down with a mysterious illness. ""I can't even explain how sick I was,"" DF told Oklahoma's News 4. ""I lost 14 pounds during that time and was really sick.""By the end of the vacation, 47 of the 114 Oklahomans reported becoming ill, DF said, with many of them too sick to leave their rooms at the Hotel Riu Palace Macao.DF said it's unclear what caused the illnesses -- Punta Cana doctors suggested a parasite might be to blame. Everyone who got sick swam in the resort pool equipped with a swim-up bar, DF recalled.Some of the sick Parrotheads, the nickname for fans of the ""Why Don't We Get Drunk"" singer [Jimmy Buffet], tested positive for _Salmonella_ spp, according to DF, who said he did not.The latest report of illness comes amid a spate of unexplained deaths on the island nation since January [2019]. The death count ticked to 8 on [Fri 14 Jun 2019], when the family of a 78-year-old Ohio man revealed he died suddenly after dinner and drinks at the Dreams Punta Cana Resort & Spa. Authorities are eyeing bootleg liquor from hotel minibars as the potential killer, sources have told The Post.""I will not be going back to the Dominican any time soon,"" DF said.[Byline: Sara Dorn]--Communicated by:ProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts[These people may be lucky they were only sick and not dead. However, _Salmonella_ sp most often causes diarrhea and cramps along with severe dehydration and weakness. While an individual may develop a fever and be sweating, the sweating reported in the fatal cases is extreme sweating.There is no report of the deceased individuals testing positive for salmonellosis.Regardless of the cause, salmonellosis, or poisoning by something other than bacteria, the resorts involved in these reports appear to have a problem. The problem may be lack of awareness of chemicals from spraying trees above air conditioning units, to someone tampering with alcohol bottles, or perhaps uncleanliness at some eating/drinking establishment. This many illness and deaths seems quite out of the ordinary for these resorts. - Mod.TGHealthMap/ProMED map available at:Dominican Republic: ][See Also:Undiagnosed deaths - Dominican Republic (02): travelers, resort, poisoning susp http://promedmail.org/post/20190613.6515494Undiagnosed deaths - Dominican Republic: travelers http://promedmail.org/post/20190609.6511612].................................................sb/tg/ao/mlEdited: 1 year ago "
"Wow go away for a couple of hours and of course, the thread (like so many others) gets overrun by Robert and his buddies.... I should have know better.... LOL. Robert, I will review the interview and it is possible that no toxicology report done on the couple as the incident happened last year. I seem to remember that the reports are flashed on screen pretty quickly so I'm glad you were able to freeze frame and do a complete analysis of the reports. The written article indicates that Doctors records show the couple were diagnosed with “likely organophosphate poisoning,” What the diagnostic was based on, is TBC, I agree. I still believe the medical records are of a value if those were done shortly after their return to the US as likely tests were done. Again, I still think that all the information points to something else than the alcohol issue...."
Yes it could be something else or very possibly something else as well.And it’s the something else as well that should be terrifying to those supportive of the tourism industry in the DRThis is going to be a story with many arms and legs going in all directions.Lots of people reporters bloggers will be going over DR constantly. Looking for anything. And when you start looking for stuff you will find it.So now they have to worry about pesticides as well as booze on their vacation.How in the world is that anything but bad?And don’t tell me that pesticide use in 3rd world countries that have been going on for ages or illicit booze operations that have been going on for ages can be fixed quickly. Or that other significant bad issues will not be found by all those looking for a story.I am afraid this is going to get a lot worse
"Post 43... good Post,...interesting info"
Evidence based info always is a winner in my realm. This is the group that lets us predict when the next pandemic or other earth shattering illness may present. Bugs
"As usual Bugs your posts are some of the best in this group. No BS, speculation or drama. Kudos to you!"
I would say this is a group not that this is the group that tells us that we have an ongoing or emerging problem. I doubt they predict as much as they see what is happening already and go from there.In the US that info and advice on epidemics comes directly from the source——the CDCAnd trust me CDC is never waiting for someone else to tell them they have an epidemic on their hands.
"If there are issues that become known the spotlight being shined on the DR should bring around change and transparency, that is if they want to stay viable as a top tourist destination. In the end that's not a bad thing. Stay tuned to see what comes of it. We should all be sensitive to other's misfortune, whether that be due to falling ill (or worse) while on vacation or losing your livelihood due to a dwindling tourism industry if that's where this goes.Edited: 1 year ago "
I read the same thing that Mark read on one of these threads and I think there was a link or source provided.
"Could pesticides have made their way into the alcohol? I wonder if there is cost cutting when buying or supplying alcohol and it is being homemade or diluted with cheaper products? During prohibition they made homemade booze that could kill you. I recently went to a Secrets in Cancun. Everyone, including me, drank on and off all day, but no one appeared drunk. How? We noticed the strongest drink was from our mini bar, in other words; they had to have been watering down the drinks. I saw them pour my drink from the name brand bottle, so...what was really in the bottle I wondered. Not the same thing, I know, but I just wonder in general what any of us are really drinking at these AIs."
"One third of all alcohol in DR is illicit, i.e., unregulated, untaxed and potentially poisonous."

Yeah you figured me out Robert. Kudos. Tell me why it's impossible to have empathy for both the visitors who have had these tragic things happen and the workers who may lose their livelihoods? As for you being kind and humane I'm seeing very little out of you and the rabid group of new posters to this forum who seem to be capitalizing on an awful situation. Sure you can say all your postings are made as a warning to future travelers but that just doesn't feel right. Too many LOL's and Buttercups and pats on the back by you guys when someone else has a snappy put down to a dissenting poster for me to believe you're all here doing the honorable thing. It's a shame too because there are people coming here looking for help and I'm sure they're leaving with more questions than answers. By the way I haven't been to the DR in 9 years and have no trips planned for the future but do keep up your prognosticating.Edited: 1 year ago 
"Brugal spot on!!!! Couldn't of said it better! It is one thing to advocate for the victims and seek answers. But the underlying tone in his posts and many others is more so a sick enjoyment to condemn those who don't fall within his beliefs/ agenda. It is frightening that you can pick up the smug and ""holier than thou"" attitude through a forum, can only imagine what that is like in person... yikes!I have a trip planned and like you said, I came here looking for answers and instead found more fear mongering, shamming and overall spite than anything else! TA was once a good place for help and assistance, I am beginning to think things have changed and people have moved elsewhere. Can't really blame them! Heck Facebook has better groups.. and that's saying something!"
"So you have been around TA long enough to know that a TA travel forum ,for a place experiencing death, sickness, and fear of an unknown origin and a problem that may be ongoing and growing coupled with the fact that it’s a major international news story——and you are expecting normal every day travel advice?And not a constant discussion of those scary deaths and sickness?Look if that is what you were expecting then I am frankly shocked."
"You bring up some good points #53. If I drank half of what I drink on vacation at home, I'd be so wasted. But this is true for everywhere I've been. Mexico. Cuba, Jamaica, etc."
"Yes! Thank you! Also, a question many of my friends are asking and I am wanting to know too...is it only American's dying and getting sick. All could be coincidences and yes, we fat unhealthy stupid American's over ate and drank ourselves to death. But come on-green foam coming out of a decease man's mouth? What? did he eat too much guacamole or wasabi? No. And then....the engaged couple being found dead in their room at the same time dying of the same thing? Cool. I see nothing. It's only a conspiracy. Look-nobody is thinking something is being done intentionally-something is going on though. Everyone says the workers and Dominican people are lovely and wonderful. Something is happening by mistake. Figure it out and make it stop. This is NOT normal to have so many people dying in such a short time. The Tourism Ministry doesn't need to come out and say they are hiring a public relations expert.. hire doctors and chemists to figure out what they are doing wrong and stop vacationers from dying. Don't come back and say all of the toxicology machines are ""broken"" Give us our dead back in a pine box not in an urn so we can do your job for you. Come on. There is no conspiracy - it is something though. A healthy 41 year old lady doesn't take a drink and die. I know people I know are cancelling their trips to the DM and going to Jamaica or the Bahama's."
BrugalIn response to your post #58Why did you bump almost a dozen old posts last night? Do you have a certain agenda to get some posts off?
"Does anybody remember the family from Delaware, parents and two teenage sons, who almost died on St. John in 2015 or 2016, and took the boys months and months to recover - one son a couple of years? It turned out the condo complex had used an exterminator that illegally used a banned product containing methyl bromide on the property right below the condo. I wonder if there could be any connection between the places tourists got sick or died in the DR and a recent, common extermination company? If so, hopefully the products used are being investigated. Just came onto these DR happenings in the past week or so, so please don't attack me if I'm asking an already answered question or throwing out an old theory."
"Zzzoey, that's a very interesting point! Makes sense. Hope someone is looking into that.By the way, I am in Hendersonville Tenn right now! Supposed to be in PC but cancelled so hubby suggested a little road trip to Nashville ( our third!) to check out some great music, lie by a sunny pool and try out amazingly expensive guitars at Guener( spelling?) that are out of our reach. Haha. Hope I don't get attacked for being off topic!"

If she says these are unrelated who are we to question.It’s true there was some conflict of interest stuff when appointed because of trump interest in the DR from a business stand point. But she has been active her whole life in politics and once sold insurance.She also started a club for the potus before he was potusShe also has a BA in fine artsIf she says these deaths are unrelated I don’t think we should be questioning that
