"It's the same thing in any city around the world that's under a lockdown. Unlike here in Vancouver, businesses haven't boarded up their windows to prevent thieves from breaking in."
"It's a ghost town here as well in the Washington DC metropolitan region. I was out and about yesterday around noon, because being holed up for a week working from home was driving me crazy, and the streets were eerily empty and quiet.Made a detour to the airport to see how it was, and there was 1 car dropping off passengers in departure, and 2 cars picking up in arrival. The entire main terminal had maybe about 20-30 people.Hopefully they can find a vaccine or treatment soon so life can resume.Edited: 2:08 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"They say a vaccine is probably a year away at the earliest. Then they would need to ramp up production and give it to the most critical groups first.Saw on my local news that our airport was averaging 3000 travellers a day compared to 70,000-80,000 the same time last year.It's mainly being used as a parking lot for the planes right now."
"Not for long.People are pouring out onto the street even as Decree 16 has yet to expire (I believe it is set to expire 4/15 unless they decide to extend it- as suggested by some health experts).https://youtu.be/7oiLVqgbiOYSaigon was never really deserted as those photos from the link you posted, rayza. (Not like the morning of the first day of Tet).The Saigon Vloggers are continuing to update the situation daily.It's been more like Saigon pre-1975 on a weekday when most people were already at work and children in school for the most part, but not empty in any widespread manner.Cheers,John"
