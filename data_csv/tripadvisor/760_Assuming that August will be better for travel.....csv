"Right now we have our tickets are for June and have to wait until Air France allows us to switch our flights. (Right now you can only switch your travel if you are set to travel before May 30).In general is August a busier tourist time in England? Not that it will matter if this is when we can travel. Thank you, I hope you are staying safe and healthy during this time.Take care,Sandi"
"In general ,yes, because all the schools are closed. It’s fair to say that currently all bets are off though."
If travel if possible in August then I imagine every tourist site anywhere will be packed
"Are you talking about August 2020? Assume nothing, sorry. Nobody knows how long this last."
"Oh I know we don't how long it will last. Was just curious about August for travel.Yes, I meant August 2020.Thank you for your replies,Sandi"
"I would not be banking on August. Whilst it is one of the busiest times of the year tourist wise (the whole world seems to be here), this pandemic is likely to be rumbling on and the impact here on business, esp those in the travel/leisure industries will be far from resolved. I wouldn't be booking any travel for the rest of this year at a minimum frankly."
Several weeks ago I rearranged my travel for August which seemed far off at the time. I'm still hopeful but I am not committing any money beyond the flights that I have moved.
"Covid-19 concerns totally aside, August is, in my opinion, the worst month of all to visit London. With schools out, everything is packed with visitors from all over the world and from the UK. If you want to see the major sights, they would normally be packed - in 2020 with Covid-19 concerns, perhaps less so. If things are open....... I agree with others. August 2020 with the virus is too soon to expect normalcy. Go for a full refund if possible.Edited: 9:32 am, March 24, 2020 "
In late January I booked a trip for late November. At the time it seemed like forever until then. Now I'm just hoping those extra several months might help.
"The current main objective of UK government policy is to slow the spread of COVID-19 in order that the limited medical resources are not trying to cope with more sick people than they can handle.This implies extending the period over which preventative measures are taken.So whereas a month ago we might have assumed (or said on this forum) that things would be getting back to normal by late summer, I think that is now unrealistic. I would not book a UK holiday for August 2020 until the future is much clearer. In particular, don't spend any money now, even if it's technically refundable (because some businesses won't survive this crisis). I would be thinking more in terms of spring 2021 - and even then things may not be as they were just a month ago."
"You have to have hope, if nothing else, at this present time.I am hoping to visit Paris in September ... all paid for ... my Gallery & Museum experience.Anthony K"

September is a better option for holidays.Schools backRates can be lower Less crowded Weather can be mild and settled And slightly more chance of things getting back to normal - fingers crossed
"I hope that things get back to something approaching normality by August, but I don't really expect it I'm afraid. I wouldn't be thinking about any international travel in 2020 at this point. Maybe hings will look brighter in a few weeks, but at this point, I'm not very optimistic at all."
"To be blunt I wouldn't be planning any travel for the rest of this year, partly due to the infection rates, esp in the US ,which I think are far from their peak, and partly to see what businesses, both travel providers and leisure activities are still standing."
"Even if we were back to normal by August I dont think there will be public acceptance of foreign visitors who do not have certificates saying they have had the virus. I'd expect public pressure for antibody testing of visitors on arrival and sending back any who dont test. America is going to be a hotbed of infection for many months, longer than in the UK. I hope you will be well enough to be able to contemplate travelling."
We are travelling the opposite way to the US September or let me put it another way - supposedly. All our arrangements can be canceled apart from British Airway flight as far too early to do anything about for that time period. We are resigned to the fact we will not be going anywhere this year. Best be safe then sorry.
"#17 +1 well said.I’ve cancelled all my hotels for my August Canada trip and will wait for AC to cancel the flights. I don’t think there will be international travel for a long while to come.Even if there were travel I don’t want to sit on a plane travel through airport etc with people who may still have the virus. If I was you I’d cancel what can be cancelled, mentally cancel the rest and Mentally plan some trips for UK when domestic travel starts up. Support our businesses and economy before travelling abroad.Edited: 3:57 am, April 03, 2020 "
I have to concur with the recent posts. I wouldn't want to travel internationally even if it's possible within the next 8 months - but I don't think it will be.
"You say ... ""I have to concur with the recent posts. I wouldn't want to travel internationally even if it's possible within the next 8 months - but I don't think it will be.""I disagree. If people follow the guidelines laid down by their Governments and are vigilant about social distancing and personal hygiene, then I feel that Airlines, Hotels and Attractions could be operating again early in September.Keep well allAnthony K"
"You can disagree if you want to, Anthony. Time will tell if my opinion is right or wrong.It's just the way I see it, there's a good chance that everyone will realise that travel has allowed the spread of the virus in the first place, and even if hotels are open, flights operating and there are no restrictions on travel, many people will not want to go very far until there is a vaccine."
"Visas and ESTAs and the like will be amended Travellers could be asked for a declaration and evidence that they are COVID19 free. antibody testing is not yet available and testing for the virus is limited to certain groups - even that is inadequate. How can anyone state that they are virus free Millions of certificates required and doctors verification would take time even if it was possible So maybe international travel is going to be restrictedEdited: 5:11 am, April 03, 2020 "
I agree that international travel might be possible later in the year but it will be restricted. It's going to take a long time for things to return to how they used to be. If they ever do.
"Roj BlakeIf people choose to stay at home, when the restrictions are lifted, that is hardly my concern. Everyone will determine their own vacation and business travel needs.My desire is to enjoy vacations once again, to lift my spirits and wipe away the sadness of vacations that I have been forced to miss.CheersAnthony K"
"I agree with Roj, I don't think things will be 'normal' for a long while yet.My children and grandchildren all live in Australia. I am so looking forward to seeing them but don't think it's wise to assume it will be later this year. No matter how much I yearn to see them, it's foolish to imagine the end of 'this', get my hopes up of travelling and then get disappointed.I'm not sure anyone can accurately predict when it will end, we can guess, but actually countries like Australia are way behind us in numbers of cases, so I guess, they will take longer than us to be 'normal'."
"BellaI hope you will get to Australia sooner rather than later. My son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter were due to come to London this Easter break.I am the eternal optimist.CheersAnthony"
"Listening to the Today Show before I leave for school and my travel questions are a mute point now.US State department just announced that it is only processing passports for life or death emergencies. My hubby and I have our passports, but we just applied for our two kids passports in the last few weeks.....(before the travel restrictions....)One day I want to wake up to good news. Take care and stay safe and healthy,Sandi"
"SLN19679 - ""One day I want to wake up to good news.""Everyday you wake up to a husband and two children, how much good news do you need.Keep wellAnthony K"
I always enjoy your prospective on things ANthony K......thank you. :)
"Marty apI note your cancellations, and personal reasons outweigh all other considerations.I'm sure Delta airlines will be understanding, perhaps wait awhile before contacting them. Some sort of voucher, I am sure, at the very least, will be offered to you.As for your December bookings ... don't be too hasty to give things away ... who knows come October you may have a change of mind.Keep wellAnthonyPS ... Why oh why didn't you give away your Caribbean cruise ... I would have grabbed at that one....Edited: 6:37 am, April 04, 2020 "
Thanks Anthony......I’m sure Delta will offer some voucher. Plenty of places up and down the east coast of the US we could drive to so that will hopefully be possible. Until there is a vaccine I’m afraid traveling will be on hold.....and the last place I would want to be is on a cruise ship at this time. Could you even imagine what it was like for those stranded this past month....and in an inside cabin!
"I'll suffer it, in the Caribbean, if I must ...Keep wellAnthony K"
"Why would you cancel a September booking now? No one can confidently say what the situation will be like then. If Delta are operating flights normally in September, they are not very likely to issue you a voucher."
"Or our borders might be closed, our 'attractions' might still be closed. In fact it's likely.This thing isn't going to go away any time soon.I think Marty is doing the right thing."
"I understand we might lose the amount paid for the Delta flight. We travel to Europe every year but until there is a vaccine we will stay closer to home......just a personal preference. Guess we can help our economy once this is done. We are both 70, no health issues......just watching what is happening in our NY hospitals is enough to make traveling not that important"
I would not assume anything . In fact I have cancelled my holiday in France which was to take place for most of August.
"I agree with Martyap. This is not about the covid-19 virus alone. I work in a Resort Town in New Hampshire USA. Tourism is not going to pop right back up to normal levels when the bans are lifted.There will be physiological reasons for people to limit travel and major financial reasons for people to stay home. Many people have lost 30-40% of their savings and retirement. My friends, in sales forecasting, at the worlds largest hotel company are expecting transient room sales to be depressed for at least 3 years."
"I remember the beginning of March and the topic was.....should we or shouldn’t we? I pleaded that it was not a good idea and many did not listen. Not sure what happened to them. I do not think international travel will be without tremendous risk until there is a vaccine. This virus will not magically disappear once August or September or October gets here......Donald Trump might say it will but we know what that means.....and all the things snorkelbear has pointed outEdited: 6:18 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"""I pleaded that it was not a good idea and many did not listen. ""Schadenfreude much?"
No pleasure.....just pointed out the pitfalls of getting ill across the pond; being quarantined in a foreign country; what travel insurance might not cover; What additional expenses you might incur........not what vacations should be about and this might be around for a while
Any idea if UK Gov will extend the tourist/visitor Visa? My trip is cancelled and I see no sooner than next May when the schools are closed here in India. The Visa would expire by then and UK Visa are very expensive.
#26 Restrictions are slowly being lifted in Australia but our health officers are telling us international travel restrictions will be the last to be lifted. One MP has stated forget about overseas travel this year and encouraged Australians to travel domestically this year. Assuming our internal borders will be opened soon. Most states and territories closed their borders at the start of this crisis. There is talk of travel being allowed between Australia and NZ as both countries have comtrolled the rates of infection. It is going to be a long winter in Melbourne if internal travel is restricted for an extended period.
"We had similar issues with a planned trip to Vietnam during the SARS epidemic in 2003,. We were able to work around it then, but SARS was a different beast to the Coronavirus. Although it did die out after a year or so and has not been a problem since even without a vaccine. It would be lovely if this happened again, but we are cancelling our July trip to the UK in July and hopefully will rearrange for Sept 2021. Fingers crossed for a vaccine!"
A lot of events in August are still considering their options. I would consider swapping for at least September which can be just as nice as August regarding the weather and schools will probably be back by then (it they aren't then there will be some form of lock down still in place)
I.m thinking October for my trip to London and Edinburgh What do you think
"Christine,We have answered you on previous threads. Simply put no one knows but my money would be on no international tourism before 2022. Others may disagree."
query on what grounds ? regmaiche
"We cancelled our late September trip to London and Edinburgh and have no intention of traveling internationally until there is some resolution......a vaccine, hopefully. Way too risky to leave your country and face unknowns abroad. If there is a way to support our local economy we will do so but even domestic travel may not be in our future. Sad......we are in our early 70’s and would love to continue traveling yearly but it may not be in the cards.We will see what Delta offers in September but a future voucher would probably be useless. Stay safe"
"50 very wiseany other is like playing cards in the ""last chance saloon"" holding busted flush regmaiche"
