"Hi Roisin kWe must visit Macher and Haria in September....love hopping on buses to the villages at least two days during hols. Breaks the monotony of the norm holiday, sunbathing, drinking, shopping, drinking, eating, drinking, tour guides (no drinking!). Also helps with learning the lingo as many village bars/shops/eateries haven't got fluent English speaking assistances."
"17 sleeps for me ..getting really excited now. This will be the big 30...visits to lanzarote not birthday LOL First took hubbie for his 40th birthday, 23 years ago, so seen some big changes! Never forget it was snowing at home and we were sitting by the pool reading abt how bad the weather was in uk Funny thing is our kids have tried other places (as have we) and though have liked them..majorca, corfu, crete etc they keep going back to Lanzarote lolEdited: 4 years ago "
51!! Can't wait. I was there with my family 11 years ago but I'm going with my partner for a week. I can't wait for olenty of sun and cocktails. I'm living for it!
"Love this because people only realise that they are actually going to the best island when they countdown the days.Those that are returning after many years will be surprised at the changes and those going for the first time will just be suprised. The regulars, well, were else would we go to chill out and meet up with old friends...and young?63 remaining"

"CamGlobal & holidaybluesx, you will either love it or otherwise. Love it and you will be back"
"Thanks. I get the impression that it is a bit of a Marmite destination but I just fancied going somewhere different this year and I'm happy to take a gamble. I know some people who go every year and others who have said ""never again"".I'm usually in SE Asia in late October/early November but I can only spare a week this year and the Canaries seemed the best bet for some sunshine and not too far away."

"No sleeps,arrived yesterday.Weather a pleasant 22 degrees."
I know you are not supposed to wish your life away but I wish my holiday would hurry up!44 days to go!
"I never book mine too far in advance, that way you don't have too long to wait!"
"It's not waiting Paul B, its anticipating which is half the fun! I always like to have at least two holidays booked so I can look forward to them.At the moment, I've got four trips booked taking me up to September, but I am sure I will fit more in before then. The joys of retirement!Lanzarote on the 19th March next."
yayayunder 100!!! 81sleeps xxxx
6 more for us anyone else going around then?
"We are the same as you MrsKris, unfortunately not retired yet but like to have a few holidays booked.At the moment we have 2 weeks in April, a week in May, 2 weeks in August, a week in October and 2 weeks April 2018. Not all in Lanzarote but most are!!At least while we still have to work it gives us something to look forward to!!"
"No wonder you are 'Tired-out-dad', working hard to save for the six weeks of holiday!!Good on you.Have a great time."
Hats off to you Tired-out-Dad! My daughter and her husband are teachers but they schedule a holiday away at every half term or longer break. Downside is that the prices are always high in school holidays but they work very hard so deserve the time off.
"14 for me.....leave wet Manchester at 6:30am and be in sun by dinner time...can't bl@#dy wait, back to Pdc for about the 8th time...we love the place, the people,the beaches, the bars, the restaurants, the shopping, the relaxing, the sun (hopefully) and most of all the peace without our kids, lol...anyone going for the first time, YOU'll LOVE IT!!"
"1875033Pete666In the sun by dinnertime? Maybe, but remember it is winter here too!OK the sun was out today, but it was only about 24° and with the wind chill factor made it feel more like 20°.I hope it warms up for you in a couple of weeks time."
3 sleeps for us. Both first timers staying in jable burmudas
26 for us also. Looking forward to the holiday now!!
"Well, I have got one more sleep - before we go home:(Had a lovely time. The weather was very changeable at the beginning of the holiday but then it's been perfect goldilocks weather. Not too hot and not too cold. Evenings very chilly though."

2 more sleeps - cannot believe I'm writing that!!! Ive just been looking at the live web cam for costa tesguise (as I cannot locate one for PDC) ; it looks very windy !!!??? Do I need to bring a ribbon to tie down my sunhat??
Webcam for PdCwww.lanzamedic.com/en/directions-live-cams
Thanks for the web cam link. I cannot open the web cam to live although the time on it is current. I'm doing it wrong I'm sure; I read the surgeries instructions to click on the red icon on google map and just saw 'red icon' and spend five minutes tapping the red medical cross on the web cam!
"Well, due to being let down for a long weekend break in the UK for our wedding anniversary, we now only have 5 sleeps before we embark on a replacement trip to PdC - bit hectic sorting everything this morning, but flight, accommodation and car parking all done and it's not that much more expensive!PS. bobbie - just click on the picture on the right - the one with Atlantis FM banner. It might fail if you have a pop-up blocker.Edited: 3 years ago "

"hi from hull , we be at matagorda, san marcial october up to the 12th ,"

Where you going Tracey?
"19 more sleeps and just been told this week the mother in law is now coming too.Wished it was 519 sleeps now. And, apparently we're paying for her!!Edited: 3 years ago "
All I can saw is damn Ryanair for having late availability...................
"Matagordabliss, my condolences. You must have a good reason for paying for the-one-that-must-be-put-up-with. If you happen to lose her, let me know and we will avoid her in late August. Loltheweeco, we have been trying for years to stay in the Salmarina...very hard to get two apartments for our pals to stay too. Let me know how you get on, price, amenities etc."
That's funny Bosspat. I think the other half is feeling guilty about going away for four weeks and to only have to worry about her on her own for three weeks is easier. Don't ask......
"only 77 sleeps to go , then matagorda , pocillios , del carmen here we come ,"
"Just 13 now ,,,,"
7 more for us yipee
56. Sorry I counted now. It felt closer before I counted. :(

13 Now.
Just 2 more sleeps for us. 1st time to PDC.
Ahhh...down to 40 sleeps....almost time to check in online
"theweeco, thanks for the info. We have mostly stayed in the San Marcial, but since ******** Thompson secured the franchise its impossible to book apartment only from Ireland...its package or nothing. (This is Miguel and Cissy's last year running the pool bar after 18 years!). We going AI for the first time; but still be out a few evening for dinner. Is there a manager or link for the Sal Marina or are you in contact with owners?Matagordabliss...nice one"
"12 now and the mother in law is wavering, shall I, shan't I come. I've got a 50 % chance, pray for me."
111 sleeps .............................now I'm depressed lol
46 not that I am counting of course.
Five
Down to 3 now
24 left.
"Hi bosspot, I booked it through booking.com, however you could try the following email info@lanzarote1.com It's a shame about all the AI as it makes it harder to get nice SC holidays."
theweeco...well always a first time and luckily we aren't the types to hang around the pool all day using AI priveleges (probably do one or two though out of 11) Yeh...have mentioned before that accommodation prices have increased by about 30-40% over the last two years. One would be lucky to get this year's price for the same place next year on the same dates. The package hols are taking a dive in Lanza unless you are a newbie.
"sadly 350 but at least accommodation booked, just waiting for the flights to come available lol  got christmas to come first lol  will not be jealous much xx"
1 more day then off tomorrow
"Tracey, People think we're made booking holidays so far out but I know too many people who go ""oh, I'd like to go on holidays in 2 weeks time"" and get angry when they find out how much flights and hotels cost. I normally book my holidays between Christmas day and New Year. I think most big airlines make their flights available about the 11 months in advance time. I'd keep a tracker going on Skyscanner.net so you get notified."
7 now.
"Tracey it will soon come round...We booked our trip back in January just after this years trip to Lanzarote so our countdown was similar to yours and we are now down to 175 days, 4th Jan...Mind like you we have had a few inbetween ..Theres nothing better than a countdown,especially when your on the plane coming home from your jollies knowing you have another to look forward to."
only 65 sleeps and will be in matagorda about 8-30 to 8-45pm
One !
"you are so right helen xx this year there were only 3 of us so we stayed at salmarina bungalows on recommendation. its fab ,my husband ha osteoarthritis and in constant pain so finding somewhere awesome like matagorda is a bonus. he can walk to the beach, shops and bars within five minutes x so happiy booked again this year. we flew norwegain last year and were really impressed. going to book once the exam dates have been confirmed as I can always amend the accomadation!!happy hunting xxx"
"sorry bertie and helen got the wrong people, but same reply, and yes we are happy to have booked we can happily sasxx"
4 hours until we go yipee
"6 now, mother in law probably not coming after all, going to have a great weekend now!"
Matagordabliss...tears rolling down now...so it will defo be Matagorda Bliss! When are you flying back home though?
"Back 22 August, Pat. So happy, took time off work this afternoon and treated myself to the cinema with loads of ice cream in celebration!"
"Ok Matagordabliss, good to know. Out on 26th so I don't have to look out for a lost ma-in-law. Where are you staying and what are your Centro plans?"
"Staying at Costa Sal, Pat. Betwixt and between Centro & Jameos centre, Peggy's, Decky Dillon's, Auld Triangle for GAA, namely TIpp semi-final now and anywhere else the craic takes us."
"Sportsman, Late Late Bar"
132 for us. Really looking forward to a week in PDC. Happy holidays to all those going !!!
2 to go.
"2 to go. Just found out the reason mother in law doesn't want to come.......................... She has lost her passport. Used it three months ago, hasn't seen it since, apparently has been looking for it for 2 weeks. Truly, there is a god, I as a lapsed C of E member, I now have found my lost faith.Edited: 3 years ago "
21 for us!! Can't wait first time to PDC hope it's gunna be hot hot hot ☀️☀️
"Matagordabliss, you fly tomorrow, and without the mother in law. Enjoy. Try not to get talking to any Londoners in case they don't like you for being from Ireland. Best to avoid anybody from England I would say.(in reference to the recent threads)BTW, it's only tomorrow. You do know that your mother in law could be in the Cork Passport office today with proof of travel getting an Emergency passport/Passport card for tomorrows flight."
"Thanks Bertie. We phoned the passport office in Cork, apparently it's by appointment only, the earliest being Friday.To be honest, being a Londoner myself, for some reason, be it at home or in Lanza I seem to end up in the company of other Londoners, those supporting Tottenham anyway."
"2 weeks today, with a little weekend away just before we come out !! Happy Days!"
"Well you can keep your Tottenham friends. I passed through Tottenham Hale on the way to Stanstead after a match, so they piled on at that stop, and my suitcase was in that suitcase holding area and one of them sat on it. I'm done with all Londoners and Tottenham fans now. haha As someone from Surrey myself I can claim Britishness but seeing as I lived there for 2 months after being born it doesn't count, if only legally, as I moved to Limerick. Glad to hear your MIL can't get a passport so for your sake. Enjoy Lanza"
"Six nights before our trip to Playa Blanca. My 3rd trip to Lanzarote this year! Note to self, must start to think about packing:)"
About 5 hours woooohooo
"Ah now c'mon, Matagordabliss, did she look under your mattress? Horror to realise that you in company of that other North London club. Say 'Hi' to Anthony in the Sportsman, he follows the sort of third North London club...of course there is really only one North London club (although emigrating from South of the river)...the others get envious and move to or build stadiums to catch up with the real one's status...Up the Gunners.Anyway...back to the topic....It's arrived...no, not Matagordabliss's ma-in-law's passport, check-in online day. 30 days to go."

So you're Terry or Christine?Isn't this a Wedding Anniversary? Already knowing you'll be in a bar by yourself is either a good thing or bad thing to have pre-planned on an Anniversary I guess. LOLI'll be in PDC myself 9-16th September. Haven't been in those bars though but know the spots.

"3 weeks tomorrow, so 22 sleeps....or 5 if you're an insomniac."
"Hi Sunprincessanne, here well over a week and been to Tiny's a couple of times. For those not yet aware,a visit to the new bar Rock Inn in the harbour is welll worth it...you will not be disappointed...and it's hot hot hot"
"Is that the place(Roch Inn) at the top of the Marina where the fish restaurant and taxi rank was? I like a Rock Bar, something for this weekend I guess as we'd be heading down there for San Miguel bar anyway."
4 more from me we are really looking forward to it
"It's finally got to 10. Time to start thinking about first meal. Arrive about 8 pm will need water for a brew, and a bit of something to eat."

"62 sleeps , getting in the mood .............."
None. Off to the airport in an hour.Get in there.
"Lucky Sod. Peter 2 Sleeps in our house. Yet I was in the airport yesterday on a job and working near a boarding gate on airside. I looked up and it was a flight going to Lanzarote. Some git with a few pints in him says ""I'll send some sun back"" and I said ""I catch the same flight in 3 days so hold onto it for me"" and his friends made that ""BURN"" sound to him. :D"
"Back at work after 2 weeks in Zante, just reset holiday countdown!51 days till we are back in PDC!!!!!"
1 sleep to go!!!
"7 to go now, just hope EHIC cards come on time, forgot to check expiry date, runs out on 11th Sep."
Does the EHIC number change though if it's just a renewal? I'd say you can still get treatment without the card as you'd be on the system. The card cant be charged as such like a credit card. Maybe give them a call in your EHIC place and ask them for the numbers. Must get the wife to check the cards she has in her purse. She carries them around for some reason.
"Hi Bertie, I applied for replacement card on Tuesday 5th, they say should get it in 10 working days. I think the number on card stays the same. they sent me an e-mail with a phone number to ring for a Provisional Replacement Certificate, but you cannot apply for it unless the need for treatment arises. Its just the messing around, at the hospital, or clinic, should you need one."
"20 sleeps matagoda 28 th sept , 2 weeks in lanz heaven"
"6 to go now. good news is, our EHIC cards have arrived. Good service 4 days. Been in loft this morning, cases down, put a few bits and pieces in."
My suitcases are in the car. Flights is not till tomorrow but we're off to Cork for the night now.
"Fantastic Bertie,Have a great holiday."
Bertie it's hot hot hot out here
4 Sleeps. Roll on the 13th!!
Thanks Peter. It says it should be 26 tomorrow. That's okay for us. Pasty Irish skin I have.
"Hotter than that today Bertie. Too hot for me, I've been in the shade or inside most of the afternoon. Just had a quick look at thermometer on our patio and it's 32 and that's in the shade.Have a nice few pints tonight and a safe flight tomorrow"

26 sleeps left and cant wait! weather is awful here in the uk
Oh dear god NO! I was buying more flights yesterday online and noticed I entered my wifes name as her married name but her passport is in her maiden name. €98 for a new passport or €110 for Ryanair to change the name so I chanced asking them on their web chat thing.Ryanair within 3 minutes of being on the chat confirmed her correct name and changed it(got new e-mail with booking reference) without a fee of any kind. Said to bring the marriage cert to the airport just in case. Phew Phew Phew. I guess he could see our flight history on my profile and see that it was always her maiden name travelling and the first name was always the same so not as though I was bringing somebody else.
Down to 50 now ...considering it was booked on the 22nd January this year just after we came back its come round quickly
Nice to hear a bit of positivity regarding Ryanair Bertie. Not often it happens.Only one short sleep left for me. I'll be at the airport at 4.30 in the morning for my Ryanair flight.
"3 sleeps to go.@Peter L, I know you have an early flight, which can be a drag, but to be honest we prefer this, usually we go for the early option, sleep on the plane, then we have the whole day at our holiday destination. This time we arrive at 6pm, will probably get to our apartment for 7pm, by which time it will be dark and we will have lost a whole day.Hope the weather stays good for us.x"
Correct thenumberthree couldn't agree with you more. We are unpacked and sat on the patio with a beer.
2. Friday morning bright and early with Ryanair out of Dublin. As usual staying in Jable Bermudas. Cant wait to see them all there and in the Rendezvous.

"Thanks Bertie. ..still there a little bit but nothing like it was....I was starting to think we wouldn't get..I was even off alcohol ,that's how bad I was ☺"
"I have it Helen, I have it pretty bad but as I'm a man it's much worse, LOL. I'd say childbirth is a walk in the park compared to this. I had a cold in November, cold in December and now I'm a full blown flu with a Fever. Every year I say I'm getting the Flu Jab but feel guilty asking for it as I'm not a high risk case, my wife is high risk but she can't ironically get it because it affects her other medication. I think Boots do them for very little cost. Next Winter maybe. I'm sure the sun and it's Vitamins will perk you right up."

"Hi everyoneWe have had to wait 709 days for this holiday! Yippee, we have NOW only 18 days to wait, but I will tell you are story of getting here!We first booked this holiday on 1 April 2016 (what fools we were lol) to go away on 11 March 2017, but hubby had to have his hip replaced in January 2017 (luckily for us we only paid a £120 deposit when first booked and should have paid remainder by 1 January 2017), because hubby had hip op wasn’t sure if we could still go, Monarch let us wait until he came out of hospital to pay remaining balance. Unfortunately we had to cancel, but Monarch said we could put our holiday forward to 2018, (has we had already got others holidays booked for last year) which we did. When they went under in October last year I couldn’t believe it, but the night It was on the news I booked with Jet 2 so hence the story we have had to wait so long! Has Jet 2 advert sings “I’m ready for this”!!"

"Two more sleeps for us as well. As regards the weather, it is what it will be. You can never be sure what to expect and we take it day by day."
Are we all gone asleep and waiting to wake up the before departure to Lanzarote?Thinking about May in about 84 sleeps time

Just 30 for us when we’re over for a week.

6 to go. Happy days
2 more sleeps.... Can't wiat
Ah...it's the final countdown......10 to go...so watch out you people
"Why ""sleeps""? That's baby-talk, isn't it?"
Thought the purpose of the forum is to provide advice. Why anyone would be interested in telling someone you don't know & never likely to know when you're going on holidays beats me. There again some people just like to see their name on screen. Personal choice I suppose.
"'There again some people just like to see their name on screen'. scarletglobetrotter, hence your reply.It's called fun...try it sometime...you may enjoy it.9 more sleeps and my name on screen again...great isn't it"
44 sleeps left then back where we belong
6 to go...break in new shorts lol
55 for us newbies
Mine is 62
So what
So what - This is a nice post where people are happily looking forward to their holiday and sharing their excitement with like minded people. It’s quite harmless banter. I find it annoying that people make negative comments. So what if we like to express our love of spending time on a holiday island that we (many contributors to this post) absolutely love to visit and share our experiences with each otherEdited: 1 year ago 
"I think my post has been infiltrated Trump-like negative individuals...narrow minded...the last one, Niccip72, has never asked about Lanzarote...I doubt if the person has ever been to it; therefore, to those who continue to act as idiots, please stay away from this post.Thank you Ger, Bikets, Arthur and all positive postees.Now...what was I going to say originally before seeing that post...oh yes...6 more to go lolEdited: 1 year ago "
"PS.....hope you enjoy your first visit, Bikets"
"My apologies I meant to ask so what is the best thing you all enjoy in pdc, but I pressed submit by accident , I wasn’t being disrespectful to anyone"
Niccip72It would be best to start your own thread and ask that question. You would get more relevant responses rather than asking within a very long running post. People on this forum are very friendly and would be delighted to share their experiences. Ger
"I may start one, Ger....a type of survey. Niccup72, fair play to you...cheers."
To get the thread and ourselves back on course - 50 left for us
90 for us. Two weeks in PDC - happy days!!!
Sorry for the misunderstanding everyone x
Well folks...one more semi-sleepless night to go...lashing down at mo here in Dublin...I bet all will change as soon as flight Bosspat head off tomorrow.

3rd month so down to only 202 more sleeps...I can feel the warmth already
"Hi bosspat, flying out on the 19th, covid 19, allowing. I hope everyone stays healthy and manages to get their holidays. We’re in, I suppose a high risk category for more than one reason, but we’re too long in the tooth to be restricting our lives now. Live life, long life to you all."
"ewnatnana, you are correct...hopefully it's the heat that is keeping it away. You go enjoy yourself as much as possible."
37 more days flying from Bristol staying at the Fanya and Flamingo hotel Puerto del carmen .
"104 for us & it's going sooooo slow!! Fly late afternoon 22 June for 2 weeks. Been to Costa Teguise many times but this will be our first time to PDC. Daughter (16) hasn't been with us to Lanzarote before so we'll pop over to CT for a day to show her where we said our wedding vows last Nov (Playa Bastion) & we must take her to Casa Felix for lunch. We'll call for a few drinks & meet up with friends that we have made over the years that live in CT then back to PDC. - Not that I am making plans at all, honest hahahaI have a feeling, looking at the forums & Facebook groups that PDC may become our new favourite! It's literally all I am thinking of at the minute. Think I need a holiday :)"
10 - cannot wait! Need some sun after the most miserable wettest winter ever!! SO EXCITED......Love Lanzarote - it has a charm that cannot be explained and keeps drawing us back.
None am here now in playa blanca
We have 41 and counting down
"100, hopefully covid-19 won't scupper everyone's holiday's"
None am here now
"Now that the dreaded covid-19 has hit our fav island, I truly hope you all take the same precautions as back at your home area. Don't let it put you off if already booked. Keep up to date with further info.Enjoy"
"If the thread followers are still about, please don't' despair...you will return or get there for the first time. Meantime, keep safe and healthy to top up that tan."
30 but no chance of going. Hope june is still possible.
"234 sleeps. But what will be left when we get back to the island? Hopefully the Madrid government will be helping businesses all over Spain and they can pull throughEdited: 4:23 am, March 26, 2020 "
I know this original post is 3 years old but we would have had 26 sleeps not sure how many sleeps we will have before we can return :-(
We are due to travel on 11th June but looking increasingly unlikely. So disappointing but there are far worse things to worry about at the moment.Stay well everyone.
"My crystal ball isn't working so impossible to predict. I do know that my countdown that says 42 days isn't worth having any more, and realistically neither is the one that says 185 days."
"Well folks, I was never a pessimist; therefore, only 175 more sleeps .Keep safe"
66 doubtful212 hopeful325 confident
"I’ve amended my June booking to June 2021. Around £120 more expensive for the same holiday at the same time so could be worse. Does mean that Tui have over £2000 of my money for another 14 months.I have another holiday to Lanzarote booked for August, then again in October. August doubtful, still optimistic about October."
Hope: viewed people walking the Los Pocillos prom on webcam this morning...great to see.144 sleeps to hold faith in.
73 - Doubtful170 - Hopeful454 - Surely
"No idea at the moment , as tired out dad says , “hopefully” will be able to go March - April"
"We have 241 days and very hopeful, more hopeful than going to our booking for mainland Spain mid-Sept, trying to get she who must be obeyed to agree to see if we can change that to pdc for late October shes not having any of it!! sure more chance of getting away to canaries than mainland Spain"
"Would have been 66 days but not happening now for obvious reasons, now looking to book for October to Fuerteventura. :)"
Everyone has at least 120 days.
"Would have been 50 sleeps as from today. Even though the Spanish govt have stated that the ban on international travel will continue for an unspecified time (probably Xmas), I can't do anything until EasyJet officially cancel our flight (the villa booking is being held even though I haven't paid for it), so officially we're still going!"
"Beesboy, I don’t get your reference to 120 days. Do you know something I’m unaware of?We have rearranged our June holiday to the same time in 2021. However, we need to pay the balance of our August break later this month and I am in a quandary as to what to do."
"I am saying there will be no holidaying in Lanzarote for at least another four months, the earliest I would say will be 1 September. I think it is a given that between now and then at least is out of the question."
"Ok, so in your opinion. I probably agree with you but we are in unknown territory. Even our government don’t seem to know what will happen next week let alone in 4 months."
"Do you really think that in the next four months there will be widespread travel? The general word that is coming out from the current Spanish Government is that they are looking at September/October for international travel to restart.Provided, there are airlines to fly there, the cost is not prohibitive, you can get to the airport within the UK , you meet any or all criteria to fly, that there are no setbacks in the planned phases on the Island or in the UK. Certainly my accommodation in Matagorda is not looking to reopen until 1 September at the earliest."
"Though international travel maybe permitted in Spain by July, it is up to other country governments to permit travel from/to their own. Then one has to think what restrictions will be put in place when going on hols and returning.I hope we will return there in 123 more sleepsStay safe"
"28 more sleeps. At the moment, unless Boris says No, We fly out of Bristol with Easyjet on 23 June. Flight is fully booked both ways. Fingers crossed."
"365 .... should be there right now! Moved the hotel booking to this time next year, am sitll hopefull that we might be able to get out sooner, maybe October or November, but who knows."
"Could be as little as 50 depending on what happens over the next few weeks.Keep looking at the videos that keep getting posted on Facebook to see what is open, hopefully if holidays get the green light a lot more will be opening!"
Should be on the plane and in the air right now :-(
"44 sleeps, hopefully I get to visit."
"We are trying again. 49 sleeps. Flying on Tues 11 Aug, fingers crossed again."
"Hi all....hope you are well. We are changing our minds about this year...too messy with the indecisiveness of our government regarding travel abroad. So, we are planning more sleeps than normal until our next visit; probably March"
Fingers crossed after last nights announcement 12 days!!
12 too!Can't wait!
16 for us
