"The USA had it's first detected/reported case on January 20th and Canada on January 24th while Mexico had their first 5 weeks later on February 27th. That means that Mexico is at least 4-5 weeks later in the cycle than the US and Canada. With all the tourists from the US, Canada, Europe and China coming and going at the peak season there of January and February, the virus was probably already in Zihua and certainly other highly traveled areas of Mexico. Like it or not, Mexico is still considered a 3rd world country and lacks the sophisticated medical services of it's neighbors to the west and many of those in western Europe. This will be a big problem.Unfortunately this is not like the seasonal flu where if you get it, you get it and suck it up until it runs it's course. And the first problem controlling this virus is the detection. The first testing done in the US were with kits that were inaccurate with results taking 3 days or more. Since then the testing is done with new and improved testing kits with more and better ones coming on steam every day. There are now tests that can give accurate results in 15-45 minutes. The US has performed in excess of 1 million tests to date, more than any other country, meaning the more tests you do, the more positive cases you will find. In the US as of the last 24 hours, 164,359 cases have been detected with 3,173 deaths equaling a mortality rate of 1.7%. Unfortunately Mexico is way behind on testing. In Mexico as of the last 24 hours, 1,094 known cases with 28 deaths equaling a 2.5% mortality rate. Expect the Mexico numbers to explode if and when they ever get up to speed on testing. People are going to die one way or the other, they just won't be able to tie it to the virus without testing.I know this virus is in over 150 countries, but my concern is the USA and Mexico where I have both family and close friends in each country."
Please everyone!!! Take this seriously!! Stay healthy...stay home if possibly! Definitely “distancing “ no matter where you are! Wash your hands and wash them again and again!! So many are being selfish and still in denial...this is very real!!
"I have also friends and family in many places, Lou.I can understand your concern with our country. You've been providing contradicting and even false information in the last few days about this epidemic and that doesn't take away your right to continue your campaign however, Would you be so kind as to share the sources for your numbers, that way we can make our own assumptions?Thank you kindly."
Please do not ignore this use the Internet and educate your friends. Relatives etcEurope is a catastrophe with Spain Italy daily death rate is alarming
"Miquel, what number don't you believe."
"""Miquel, what number don't you believe""I never said that. Please read my post again."
Ok what information do you think is incorrect?
"I didn't say that either. I hate repeating myself but I'm going to reword it:It would be only fair if you shared the links and sources where you pull your numbers from so the rest us can do our own research and arrive at our own conclusions.It's not too much to ask is it?Edited: 8:39 pm, March 31, 2020 "

Miguel a. Just two of many threads in the forum that has been full of stuff for a few weeks nowYou may also Google coronavirus death rates Also news channels are full of stories Finally moderators may wish to close this topic as the op has their head firmly in the sand
"Miguiel, here you go. According to the last update on Worldmeter, Mexico has 1215 reported cases with 29 deaths related to Covid-19. But what I find interesting is when look at Chile, Ecuzdor, Panama, Peru, Argentina, Columbia and Mexico as a whole, those 8 countries to date have an average of 1500 cases with 30 deaths, But when you take into account the population difference, Mexico should be many times higher on both numbers. My guess is that both numbers are under reported."

"Miguiel, think what you like. There are a number of regulars here that are long time visitors of the Zihua area and have concerns about friends and family there similar or equal to mine. While the information I post is readily available if you know where to find it, others are be unaware just as proven by you. More than likely the closest you've ever been to Zihua is this TA site. If the facts bother you, you may disregard my posts and continue to stay in a state of denial."

"So here we 1 week later. The number of reported cases in the US have a bit more than doubled with the death total of 10,943 being just over triple. In Mexico the reported case number has also more than doubled with the death total more than quadruple (125) of where it was just 7 days ago. Seeing as there is a lack of local news there regarding the virus, we have no idea of how ths is affecting the locals there. But speaking with family members there, things have all but come to a stand still. It's hard to picture what things will be like 6 months from now North or South of the border.Stay safe everyone. Wishing you good health."
Just know Lou that your discussion is with the known USA hater Rob Whitehead not his alias named Miguel.
LOL you guys need clinical level therapy.
"Acyually Croguske, Miguiel's writing style and use of verbiage is totally different than the dick tator of Zihua. In addition Miguiel spends much time on most of the all the TA Mexico destination sites and displays little of the anti American venom that Zihuaknob does. He may just be a passionate true Mexican national and possibly a good guy, unlike the other.Edited: 12:05 pm, April 07, 2020 "
"My goodness, do you suppose that Zihuaknob is just a psychologically unbalanced delusional person with narcissistic features which define his inability to be rational?"
Yes
"Not a very frequent visitor to these sites, but give them a look every so often to see what's happening in general and possibly garner some new info that can be useful when I travel down that way.Having said that I personally feel these posts lately are a treasure and some great material.....please keep them coming as it's a good laugh.I also use to visit clown boys site until his one sided thinking,babbling and drivel got so tiresome that I finally cut loose on him and rightfully so.And instead of coming back with some constructive comments to refute my view, all the tough guy could do was what he's best at. And that's ban any person who disagrees with him from his site to make himself feel proud and powerful. But truth is he's the least of either.Well done guys!!Edited: 8:38 am, April 09, 2020 "
I could not agree with you more CWR!!!!!!!!!!
"We leave part of our hearts in Zijuatanejo every year We know that the staff at our regular hotel and restaurants have been laid off. I have heard of a Rotary group in Jalisco that is helping with food security in their region. Are there creditable organizations in Zihuatanejo that are helping families who are struggling to pay rent or buy food, that we could donate to?"
"Miguel, do you even live in Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa? (your name says Mexico City) You seem to think there are no COVID-19 outbreaks in Mexico, or maybe you just like to argue?.I agree that people posting on here should site their sources. I live in Ixtapa & I see what is going on here, Ted is right, news here is sketchy and difficult to find, the hospitals here are woefully under equipped. I went to the local supermarket (Merza) here today and there were a few ignorant people not even wearing a mask. Although the vast majority were. If you want sources follow this link.Granted that number is very low, but it is 5 more than a month or so ago.https://datos.covid-19.conacyt.mx/"
"as of yesterday, that # is now 6 confirmed cases & that is probably not accuratehttps://datos.covid-19.conacyt.mx/"
Little Miguelito is a troll. Nothing more. Let's not feed them.
"as of today there are 9 confirmed cases. The population of Zihua/Ixtapa is about 120,000. That is still low. Since April 27 that is more than a 100% increase though..https://datos.covid-19.conacyt.mx/"
"In Mexico, which has the lowest testing rate in all of Latin America, they are only testing those that come forward with severe symptoms, so how many cases go unknown and uncounted?I'm watching the daily numbers countrywide and unfortunately the worst is yet to. And there was talk of reopening the hotels in Ixtapa June 1st. IMO, that would be a big mistake. The only guests would be other Mexican nationals coming from virus hot spots of the country."
es verdad
"""9 confirmed cases"" It's Mexico, how many unconfirmed cases...............? Unbelievable data.Edited: 10:51 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"follow the link I provided, it's from the DGE (the Official Mexican Governmental General Directorate of Epidemiology). Click on the interactive map for Guerrero, then Zihua. Believe it or not."
"And they want to reopen the hotels in Ixtapa June 1st. Really? Yesterday new cases in Mexico were 2,960 with a ""record"" 479 deaths, I'm guessing those numbers will continue to climb."
and it's going to get worse with no clear plan by the absolutely inept presidente of Mexico. Third world nation with no direction or guidance in times like this. I feel so sorry for all the innocent victims some of whom are our friends.The only way Mexico comes out of this pandemic is when there is a vaccine. Not a minute sooner.
"Gennaro, are you sure you know what you are talking about? The guru of Zihua, Zihuaknob is quoted as saying on March 12th, 2 1/2 months ago. ""There you have social contagion. Here we have it contained so far and are not experiencing anything remotely resembling the hysteria prevalent in the States. Mexico took action a couple of weeks before the USA responded, but we also had protocols in place since the H1N1 hysteria."" And here is a quote of his from April 9th. ""I and my family are following the recommendations of our Secretaría de Salud and we remain healthy. But I am neither the president, emperor, god, tooth fairy nor anyone else's keeper. If you're referring to the second person plural, our government has excelled in slowing the virus much better than yours, so your comment is rather silly.""And then this 3 weeks ago, another quote of his. ""I know many of you criticized Mexico's response, but unlike the USA, Mexico had a team of epidemiólogos already in Wuhan monitoring for precisely this type of problem, as the USA would have also had if The Chump hadn't fired and disbanded its own team of epidemic response specialists. Mexico wasn't caught flat-footed but responded instantly. For all our defects our medical personnel are currently responding admirably to the challenges, and enough of our countrymen are responding well enough to slow the curve enough so that our already beleaguered medical facilities would be able to cope. We are expecting the peak of infections this week on May 6.You got that Gennaro, There is no hysteria there, because they had protocols in place early, and because they had epidemiólogos (his spelling, not mine) already in Wuhan monitoring and the Mexican government there has excelled at slowing the virus. ""Medical personal are responding admirably."" Sure, those that have not been harassed, attached or forced to locate to other villages for fear that they may infect others, In many cases the patient will tested and if positive, they are sent home to ride out the virus in their residence.As per his knowledgeable Quote, "" We are expecting the peak of infections this week on May 6."" Must be talking about May 6th of next year, because today is May 23 and the number of confirmed cases and deaths are still going up. Maybe I'm confused by the term ""slowing the virus."""
