"I’m looking into coming to the Kilimanjaro area from the US in June, 2013. The flights I’ve seen from the US to the Kilimanjaro airport look really pricey. I was wondering if anyone has any tips or ideas for getting to the Kilimanjaro area as easily and as cheaply as possible."
"First, keep checking sites like Expedia or Kayak everyday to see if fares come down---sales pop up from time to time. KLM tends to be a bit higher than Ethiopian, so look to Ethiopian as a possibility. Ethiopian, at least in my mind, is a great option because the routing through Dulles gets you to JRO early afternoon as opposed to KLM's night arrival. So, you have extra time to relax and overcome any lag."
"Qatar and Turkish Air are now also flying to JRO... check to see what fares they are offering. Qatar flight from Doha will arrive about 10am; Turkish via Istanbul will arrive early morning - about 3am. Now with more competition on this route, the KLM fares might actually come down somewhat. Alternative could be to fly into Nairobi/NBO Kenya, served by more air carriers so more competitive fares and from here1) connect to 1/hr flight to JRO with fare about $275/pp, or2) shuttle bus from NBO airport to Arusha town, a short 1/hr distance from JRO and where safaris start, or if climbing JRO continue on the bus to Moshi from where these commence. ... bus fare is cheapest ($35/pp each way), takes about 5/hrs.; you'll require Kenya Visa @ USD$50 and a Yellow Fever inoc and proof of same for entry to Tanzania"
"1. You don't need Yellow Fever vaccination if you are coming from USA/Europe. Rubbish.2. Turkish Airways is a 7 hours flight from Istanbul on a Boeing 737-900. If you can survive that, you can survive the Kili climb ;)3. Fly to Nairobi if you have a chance. There are more flights by Kenyan and there is a cheap shuttle to Moshi/Arusha that connects to most of them."
"Philip's advice is not quite right: if you go via Nairobi, regardless if coming direct from the US/Europe, there's an excellent chance you'll need to show your certificate of YF jab or an exemption letter when entering Tanzania because Kenya is a YF endemic country.Edited: 7 years ago "
"I just visited my travel Dr. in Canada and he provided me a waiver for YF. Her has travelled extensively in Africa and a waiver will be sufficient if you fly directly to JRO from Amsterdam,USA etc. If you do land in Nairbo,Kenya then you will require YF."
"Phillip's advice is incorrect. If you travel through Kenya, you may need proof of YF vaccination. He has posted this incorrectly twice today. You might take all of his advice with a grain of salt."
"My advice is not right? :) Don't be silly. And, Kenya is not in the Blue Sheet this year. So unless your shuttle will take 6 days to get to Moshi, you are wrong.Tanzania (TZ)Vaccination against yellow fever is required if arrivingwithin 6 days after leaving or transiting countries with riskof yellow fever transmission"
"To the OP, try FastJet flights from Dar to JRO at a similar cost to the bus. You can't pay online though so you may need to get your tour operator to book them for you."
Huh?! Still wrong and not helpful for those needing correct advice.
"PrecisionAir also flies I believe, but I'd rather take a bus ;) The road from Dar is very well paved and at least... you are sure to have your luggage with you ;)"
"Wrong about what? I mean if you'd prefer to stick a needle with a vaccine that you don't need, you can go ahead ;) For the rest of us, we'd better do research and act upon the results."
You're wrong about your advice regarding transiting through Kenya. You're wrong when you say Kenya is not an endemic country---perhaps you can share your link for the Blue Sheet? And you're wrong telling people they can pass through Kenya and not need the YF jab (or exemption)---chances are very high that if you continue on to Tanzania through Kenya you'll be asked for documentation and risk being jabbed at the airport.
"steveb - Philip R only started posting yesterday and seems to be a 'know it all' offering lots of incorrect information. Granted we know there have not been outbreaks of YF in either country, but for a few cases in both, back n the 90s. But, Tanzaia sets their own rules regardless what the CDC or WHO say. If on arrival Tanzania by land or air from any country that fits the category, the agent asks for proof... better have or be taken to a room at point of entry to be given the jab on-site... the fee is $50/person."
Another point to raise is that Tanzania is recognized by other countries as a YF epidemic zone. So if you plan on visiting another country after Tanzania and you did not get a YF Vaccination you will be put into quarantine for about 6 days.
"All you have to do to know that this is all rubbish is to look on any Tanzanian Embassy website. It says nothing about 6 days, blue sheets, or any other color. It does say that if you leave an in transit airport, or are there in the airport for more than a 12 hour period of time in an endemic country you are required to be vaccinated. I've been asked for my proof of vaccination under these circumstances, and my flights originated in the US, with short layovers in other African countries."
"I am not going to argue with you. All of you here been there once, and I travel to the place several times a year on business. Through Kenya and direct. I know my stuff. And information that I have is not from some rubbish embassy web ;) Tanzania embassy in the UK up until recently asked ppl to come a get a visa in advance at the embassy, and many many did so. For all I care, stick yourself with a needle. I have been asked for a certificate once, on point of entry in JRO. Never seen anyone from the health dept on the border. I didn't have the certificate, though I am immunized, and came through Addis. They asked questions about whether I left the airport and for how long. I left the airport for 2 hours to have breakfast at the Sheraton. I was told as long is it was for up to 6 hours it's fine. Same info is posted in TIMATIC, which is a source for airlines to advise passengers of health regulations."
"Yes, you have been ASKED for a certficiate. If you woudn't have it on you, you'd be fine my friend."
"""All of you here been there once"". More thorough research lead you to conclude that gem?? LOL"
"Sorry, I have been traveling there multiple times (sometimes five or six times a year) a year for twenty years now. Since this is an advice board, I would like to offer some advice for you (albeit not asked for, but this is never asked for); please learn some etiquette, you need it. We try to be civil on this forum and we would appreciate it if you would practice more civility."
"Karl... just wondering if there is a Swahili equivalent to the American saying ""Never try to teach a pig to sing - It wastes your time and annoys the pig..."" I think it might apply to trying to give (good) advice to someone who already knows everything... Nonetheless, I have avoided this confrontation so far... but I, too, appreciate first hand experience reported with humility and maybe a little humor, and with respect for others who also have things to share... I've found some of the key words are ""my experience"" and ""I think"" and ""opinions differ, but I think... because..."" Name calling and using words like ""rubbish"" provoke emotion but provide little information."
"Yeah IAB. One of the things which some forget, or like to forget, is that it's not just opinions which differ, it's experiences which differ. For some who have always flown into Kilimanjaro airport they don't know what happens at Dar or Namanga, or other border crossings. And one person who goes there and is in the Northern part of Tz and goes to see the Maasai, might think that all 125 (or so) tribes are the same, which they are not. There is not one culture in Tz, although many are similar, there are 125 different cultures and ways of doing things, not to mention the sub tribes which expands it even greater. What happens in one village doesn't necessarily happen in every other village (and in some cases that's a good thing).I try to overlook, but when it gets rather harsh in some posts I have to step up to the bar and say something. Not every forum on TA is blessed with civility in their posts, and some are downright cruel, savage, and some run roughshod over others all the time. We've had good civil discourse on this forum and I'd like to keep it that way, if someone can't be civil that tells me a lot about them (typically that they're unknowing and try to hide it with harsh talk in an attempt to cower others). The old Marine in me snaps to attention when I see this, and I tend to confront it head on, with civility on my part of course, or at least I make the attempt. When civility goes out the window, so do I."
"IA and Karl I did try to avoid this post as I found one of the posters to be extremely arrogant and somewhat ignorant. It does show me that a little knowledge can be dangerous.I wouldn't like to be the tourist or Australian citizen arriving at Melbourne airport after a visit to either Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania without a valid yellow fever vaccination.I got my first yellow fever vaccination in 1981 and have been asked to show it every time I return to Australia from any overseas trip.IA the phrase you are looking for and it is on many a Khanga""usigombana na upumbavu."" another one is ""Usibishane na mginja"""

Not 125 ;) 250 tribes.
Not 250 Sorry there are 125 or so.
"Anyone who has broad experience in Tanzania knows that there are ~125 tribes, down a couple over the past several decades. Most of these have sub-tribes. A well established fact. Perhaps not reported as such on the Internet.If you are looking up your information on the Internet, as it appears you are, I can show you where to find absolute Internet proof that the world is flat, that the holocaust never happened, and that the world would end in December 2012.My knowledge of tribal life in Tanzania comes from visiting with most of them. And I know for certain that there are distinct differences in them.And by the by, most who travel there often know for certain that entry health rules are not made by outsiders such as the CDC or WHO, they are made by the Tanzania Ministry of Health for what they believe to be the protection of their citizens, and it changes from time to time; and the enforcement of the rule depends on who the Health Officer is who might be waiting for you at passport control on entry (more often than not they are not there). And when the Ministry rule changes it is not always updated on all their Internet sites. I have seen, more than once, people being led away for a vaccination at Kilimanjaro Airport, and they were protesting all the way; and it did them no good. If there is a health officer at the airport when you land they will make the rules for you at the time, and there is nothing you can do about it except to get back on the plane and leave, or comply with their rules. Plain and simple."
"FYi, I have been to TZ a couple of times. In 2011 we were never asked to show YF certificates. 3 weeks ago we had to show our YF certificate when boarding a SA flight to Dar from Joburg, then again as we entered Dar.WE had certificates, so I don't know the consequences of not having them. We vwere also asked for them when we were boarding a flight from Zanzibar to Dar and again Dar to Joburg."
If you are an Australian travelling to Kenya or Tanzania and plan to return back to Australia after your trip-You will not be allowed back into Australia without the valid certificate.If you don't have it you will be in quarantine for 6 -10 days or told to leave.For an Australian it doesnt matter whether they let you into Tz or not -it is getting back home after your holiday that matters.Edited: 7 years ago 
"Noexpert, perhaps you can clarify something for me and others. In the reading I have done the last couple years it always indicates that Australia requires the yellow fever certificate from those arriving from a yellow fever country. However, rather than actually deny those without the certificate entry into Australia, Australia apparently allows them entry under something called quarantine surveillance. Under quarantine surveillance the visitors or returning nationals are required to report any symptoms within 6 days immediately. Do you know if this is actually the case or are people actually denied entry into Australia? I certainly think it's easier to have the shot/certificate than deal with what must be some kind of hassle with the quarantine surveillance. Also, just saw something that would indicate Tanzania had been dropped from Australia's list of YF countries, though it's off the net, so who knows:traveldoctor.com.au/Article/News/News/Austra…"
Yesterday I visited a Travel clinic. Hence my earlier post. I will be making an appt. today to visit another to check if myself or other members of my family need the jab as we are all travelling at various times over the next 6 months to Kenya and Tz. The last time we all had the jab was over 10 years ago.I will print off your article and take it with me and let you know. It could take up to 2 weeks to get some info.The thing with yellow fever jabs-to have or not to have- is that peoples experiences and advice is often different and conflicting.
Thanks. Here's another link that I probably should have mentioned before. It's from an Australian government agency and probably is a bit more authoritative at least.http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever
Steve Interesting because I googled this morning some Melbourne travel sites and the ones I read all said the vaccine is compulsory for Tanzania. Most of us will be overnighting in Kenya so that does add another factor as Kenya is on the list.
"Ordinarily I would be inclined to go with the government agency's advice rather than a travel organization's site, especially when the government site has been recently updated. Of course in Tanzania, as we know, it really doesn't matter what a Tanzanian government site says , it matters what the health officials at the port of entry decide. But with Australia I wouldn't expect the same type of disconnect. But what do I know? :-)"
Steve Because of the Xmas holidays and New Year perhaps the Travel clinics haven't updated their sites yet.I'll let you know how I get on.Edited: 7 years ago 
"Thanks, noexpert. Looking forward to learning the straight dope on this matter."
