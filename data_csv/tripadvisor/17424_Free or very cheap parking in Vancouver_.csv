"Hey there,We will be spending some time in Vancouver and are arriving by car. Would like to ditch our car and take public transportation, thereby avoiding paying $20/night to park at the hotel downtown. Looks like the Park and Ride's do not allow you to stay overnight. We would be ok with leaving our car outside the city somewhat and taking the commuter train. Would be willing to pay up to $5 a day/night.Any thoughts?"
be aware that car break ins are epidemic. Leaving your car on the street even in Burnaby is asking for trouble. Maybe post an ad on craiglist.org and see if someone has an extra pkg spot.
"How many days are you wanting to leave your car for? I live in Kitsilano and outside my apartment is free parking on West 4th Ave. Its a very busy street with lots of action, and is relatively safe. All the streets are lined with vehicles either by residents of the homes/apartments or people shopping. I know for a fact some cars sit out there for days..... I leave my car outside all the time and haven't had any problems nor have I heard of any problems really either.And a major plus - it's so close to downtown, should you want to use your vehicle its a 10 minute bus ride to collect it. Parking on 4th is free (no meters) west of Balsam I believe.Hope this helps out a bit. "
I don't feel it's a good idea to leave your car unattended on the street for long periods of time. ALL areas of Vancouver are known to have a lot of break-ins.
Public transit will cost you about $4-$6 each way per person. It wouldn't cost much more than that to park the car securely in your hotel and walk.
I agree with the above messages... your best bet would be to bite the bullet and pay the high parking fee for hotel parking... at least then you have some assurance that your vehicle will be safe and you wont return to a broken in vehicle or no car at all!
"There are number of options where you can park your car at a hotel paying a relatively low daily rate and still have easy access to public transportation.For example, the Metrotown Hilton in Burnaby is charging guest $6 daily for self parking (underground parkade)and the Metrotown skytrain station is less than 10 minutes walk from the hotel.There are also other hotels in the Burnaby area that have similar offerings. Both Executive Inns on Lougheed also have very low daily parking rate for guests and both hotels are located within walking distance to a skytrain station.If you want to stay in the City of Vancouver, the cost of daily parking will be definitely higher."
