"As the West and indeed India tries to come to terms with Corvid-19 virus, I have to ask how much will it change the world of travel? There will be places such as Italy that may take an age to recover the confidence of foreigners/holiday makers to visit. We are yet to know how things will unfold in India as it is such early days. If, it is a big if there is broadly a 4-6 month period of the virus appearing to something like eradication or some semblance of safety, where will that leave Goa at the beginning of next season? All just guessing I know, however I can see travel becoming much more difficult, be that through increased air fares, airlines will be carrying a huge debit along with less carriers/planes. Prices could be significantly higher. We will undoubtedly have less money, less productivity over these months and higher taxes to come. The huge debt being accrued will need to be paid off. Then there could be a natural resistance to foreigners, such as we are seeing in South Korea with lengthy checks at the airport and quarantine measures in place. If India introduced quarantine that would effectively kill anything but the long term foreign visitor to Goa. Whilst twiddling my thumbs (time on my hands) I’m trying to think about what might be a different future. Maybe Goa will return to something like it was a few decades ago? Haven't even thought about travel insurance. Long Live GoaFranco"
Next season will be bad for all touristy places .Another factor is holidays and off days will have to be adjusted to make up the loss of work resulting in less time for holiday even if u have money.I had read that Goa would be targeting chinese tourist for next season..I cant see that happening in near furure as Indians are noway going to treat them well.
"I very much doubt if there will be a next season.But, Goa will need to get tourists back eventually, as I understand it, it is their main source of income.Most of us however will have less money to spend for the foreseeable future; this situation is extremely serious for everyone; airlines and insurers included."
"Thought provoking post Franco, my view is that Goa like all tourist destinations will take a further hit. Maybe even bigger than 19/20 season, but a lot of Brits will be desperate for their dose of winter sun, and will find a way to make that happen.A lot of UK travellers are retired/older folk who will still have disposable income, and come 20/21 season they will be looking for flights and accommodation as a way of shaking off the covid 19 nightmare.Edited: 10:01 am, March 30, 2020 "
"Fair point Jimbo, but a lot of pensions (or pension pots) will also take a massive hit. I hope they don't! Possibly the 21/22 season?I have put my circumnavigation around India via the railway network on the back burner, because I would need to start purchasing rail tickets in August 2020 and I don't think this situation will be resolved (especially in India) by then."
"Great post Franco. If only we had a crystal ball! I'm inclined to agree with Jimbo that us retired independent travellers will still want to travel if it's all behind us by the time the new season would be starting, but who knows about the charters? And for those of us who do end up going I wonder how much will be up and running and how different our trips are likely to be."
"Goa will be a future destination for domestic and foreign tourists.Irrespective of all these corona epidemic ,only one or 2 cases has been detected in Goa .So Once Air /Railway started functioning as normal ,Then Goa tourism will have a great scope Thanksmuralee"
"Goaexotic,Goa is not a natural destination for the Chinese. Firstly it takes a long time to get there, along with cost. They are not natural beach inhabitors. I don't think there are enough cultural sites (don't mean to be disingenuous) for them. They are normally busses around, so large groups turning up in the CCB? The food wouldn't suit, I really mean that, there would have to be a string of restaurants and hotels catering specifically for their needs. South East Asia is where they go, obviously destinations in Europe, but predominately SE Asia. Thailand, Cambodia, Loas, Vietnam were awash with them. More Chinese in Thailand than any other nationality. I have travelled fairly extensively in SE Asia, if people think our Eastern European brothers and sisters are different, they ain't got nothing on this lot. My experience with them is not great, they don't know what a queue is. I could go on and on here......"
"Watching the news tonight, foreigners are responsible for spreading this virus, you probably won't be welcomed back so soon."
It would be interesting if you could go on Franco; it's a subject I have little knowledge of.Kind regards
"#6#So Once Air /Railway started functioning as normal. Then Goa tourism will have a great scope.#That's the potential problem, once the transport system is up and running the spread of the virus is possible. Not saying that will happen, it travels with people. Earlier in this pandemic you had 17 Italians arrive with it, not to Goa. The Indian government may consider banning people from certain counties, which they have already done, just as a blanket ban. I could easily see Europe as a block being restricted."
Foreigners are responsible in the USA to!
"What SG says. Despite the virus originating in China, some locals or the greater public may view Westerners as the culprits. Or at least the carriers, which we probably are, even with next to none, or is it six cases in Goa."
I am somewhat surprised that India seemed to have no cases for so long?
Wouldn't be surprised to see a Covid-19 box on your Vaccination Record Booklet that your issued with once all this settles down.
The cm of Punjab stated on tv tonight the four deaths in his state are directly attributed to contact with foreigners.
The channel then ran another story that Muslim foreigners were held up in a hall for a religious event with many showing symptoms..
"The virus originated in Wuhan, people transmit diseases, always have, one things for sure.When all this does down one thing Goa will need is income, and one thing is for sure, the Goans and the business owners may secretly hate you blame you, dispise you, they will want your money. Fact.My 63+ years of life and travelling for my living has taught me that wherever you go money talks, it's as simple as that, so fully expecting to be back in Calangute 20/21 season."
Business is Business Jimbo
"Foreigners aren’t responsible for spreading the virus in India, that’s a load of rubbish. There are millions of Indians travelling backwards and forwards to destinations all over the world, are people seriously suggesting that they couldn’t have contracted the virus? Within 12 months there will be vaccination for this virus and a lot more understanding, so India won’t be putting any foreign visitors into a 2 week quarantine. That would just be replicated by other Countries in return and what would all those Indian Middle East workers do then? To be honest Goa is a very small winter seaside destination for the British, hardly a dot on the map of India, The majority of Tourists visit other parts of the country and generate massive amounts of money In the process, whether that be visiting the Golden Triangle, Rajasthan , Kerala, nature reserves etc . Goa will return back to normal and I’m predicting winter holidays next year will be in high demand, The rupee rules and visitors will be welcomed with open arms, this is India we are taking about and it’s all about the money!Edited: 2:34 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"I understand exactly what you're saying Jimbo. When this all dies down we will have to open a thread to identify those Goans who have done all they can to help those stranded through no fault of their own, and those that haven't! If and when we return, we will personally be giving our custom to those who stepped up and helped during these awful times."
Fair play RR and GBP; but cash is king
"Foreign tourist arrivals in India in 2018 (in millions)Bangladesh (2.35), USA (1.46), UK (1.03), Canada (0.35), Australia (0.35), Sri Lanka (0.35), Malaysia (0.32), China (0.27), Germany (0.28), Russia (0.26). Agreed cash is king, money talks, India will want it’s source of income and trade. However we don’t know how this going to turn out for India, I am of course just taking a punt here as none of us know. I look towards South Korea as they appear to be at the leading or cutting edge for combating the virus, remember they have had plenty of practice with previous epidemics. Their stance on testing right from the beginning and what they are doing now may seem extreme, it may be the way forward though, the size and infrastructure of India would make it difficult for them mimic. Also the Chinese lockdown in Hubei was fairly comprehensive, something India is struggling with, witness migrants walking home. This isn’t doom and gloom, just trying to see how this works for India, a country where people live on top of each other, where public transport is key, 23 million a day on the trains, 70 million a day on busses, I don’t know how many in Rickshaws and taxi’s. Modis bold play of a curfew may work, we all hope it does, if the virus has a bounce back I can see India shut for tourism for some time. Lots of us, and I mean word wide travellers/tourists book a fair way ahead, how many of those 1.46 million Americans are thinking about India right now? How many Brits are actually going to buy their air tickets or two/three week accommodation? Sorry for the negative narrative, for those that read my other ramblings you will know I am a lover of India and Goa……So. Long live the world, long live India, long live Goa.Franco"
"Totally agree Franco; the situation in India will get much much worse and for a considerably extended time before it gets better; unfortunately, this is just the beginning of India's unending journey."
"Speaking as a retired traveller, we know we will lose our Summer holidays, but having already paid for flights and half the hotel fee for November, we are really hoping Goa will be back in action next season, to give us something to look forward to. As others have said, the Goans will really need our money, and will try their best to get places open. All we can do is wait and see with our fingers crossed."
Fingers and everything else Ned!

More chance of winning the lottery than getting back to goa this year
"GOA EXOTIC.........yr comment is typical of a narrow sighted person.i found accomodation for a couple who were kicked out of their accomodation.........i met them today and they were british pakistanis..............1 a surgeon in the uk.why did i meet them?????cos he offered to bring fruit n veg round as a way of thanking me............he brought 2 kilos of tomatoes ,which i passed on to a vegetarian neighbour(i kept 4 for myself)....he is so scared to be found out as a pakastani,but is still delivering food to brits.....he dare nt deliver to indians!!!!!!you ve pissed me right off i can tell you!"
i m more than angry....i m seething!
"Tom m India is the most racist nation on earth, narrow minded bigots like goaexotic ensure that it keeps the no1 position.  I find his comments abhorrent and will pass all his future posts by"
"Goaexotic is an idiot, posts here daily I bet he's rarely been to Goa. Best ignored."
"insurance they could put a corona disclaimer in there ?things will not be normal for a bit, and if they are how many airlines or hotels might be bust? a lot of people will have a lot of holidays to use later in the year if they still have jobs. maybe britain will benefit with increased domestic travel (whilst losing intl)."
"Unfortunately there is a story doing the rounds on Indian media even seen it here on BBC that some sort of Islam convention was held in India and they may have spread vivid between themselves and now are returning to their native places, as this is India post partition in the midst of the NAA bill furore being subject to a great deal of communal tension such statements do not supprise me bit I do not support them. As to how Goa and the world will change , I hope for the better even now as I speak media outlets are calling out erranous behaviour in India and UK. We will live and learn . God bless everyone and have a honey bee or old monkey or feni on me , cheers pals!"
"Those who have a problem with my comments, you dont know what's happened here in last few hrs...its the truth and every true Indian will agree.Those who have a problem plz dont come to Goa/India."
"#34, many of us know very well what's happening in India now and the past few years. You should just say ""Hindu fundies"" instead of ""true Indians"" because that's what you mean (and are).Fools (of various religions) are behaving foolishly in many parts of the world. It's not because of their religion, it's because they are fools.Yes, stupid Muslims are doing stupid things but millions more sane Muslims are doing the right thing all around the world.Did you see the Hindu/Jain fools banging thalis and dancing in streets at 5pm on Mar 15, undoing (and more) the social distancing of previous hours in Modi's own Gujarat? Why do you think the police are beating people up (other than being on their power trips) on the streets? These are mostly local fools who think science or the laws don't apply to them.Did you read about the foolish Christian pastors still holding services in packed churches in various parts of the US and other Christian countries?Do you know about thousands of American fools who partied on the streets on Mardi Gras in New Orleans and thousand of foolish college students cavorting on beaches for Spring Break, ignoring all warnings and cautions?Read the Constitution of India. Your kind do not own India to tell anyone whether to come or not. Nobody came at your invitation. The country is not your personal property.There are many Hindus and Indians who disagree with your views.Unfortunately, there are many of your kind (mindset, not religion) in many parts of the world that spew similar bigotry towards minorities there. It's unfortunate when your kind are given titles of Experts from whom people seek guidance of some kind.Edited: 11:07 pm, March 31, 2020 "
I am not in a mood for arguments but better dont say anything about Hindus here(for ur own good)
"Are you threatening me, Mr/Ms DE on this forum?Do you know where I live or what my religion is that saying anything about Hindus would cause a problem (""for my own good"")? You are the one who made a completely unwarranted, ignorant, bigoted statement on this travel forum."
"Guys the story about the Muslim religious meeting involving between 1300 & 2200 worshippers is accurate, some have died during or immediately after the visiting the festival. All gathering of any type of over 50 are barred and most groups have respected that, they are currently showing on news channels the leaders of this group being interviewed by the senior police on the 23rd March 2020 and they appeared to have ignored the orders to postpone the event."
"Many from every form of community are ignoring the lockdown and diluting the value aimed to be achieved by the government, if this continues we can be certain this virus will become communal and numbers will grow, both positive & deaths."
Yesterday when these people were being detained(suspected cv) by police..they started spitting on the authorities and cops. Is this acceptable..they are deliberatly creating nuisance there is no doubt about that.
"Wow just read tourist dept orders guest houses not to charge stranded tourist while they wait to get repatriation, good show Goa , way to go."
"Good Morning all, it's 8-30 am in Wales, another day locked up ,and that's right. Just read the latest posts on this thread. What is going on here , if you have racist thaughts keep them to your self , they are not material relevant to this FORUM .Avul post #34 is spot on there are crazy people all over the WORLD. As for the threat, that is beyond the pale. MK"
"Hear hear MKEdited: 4:07 am, April 01, 2020 "
"It would be wonderful if the world changed to forget all this stupid hatred. The virus is treating everyone the same, no matter what belief you have. So we should treat everyone the same too."
"No 41, this not only happens in Goa, My friend was stuck in Torre del Mar Spain, he only paid for the week he booked the 8 days after that there was no charge, he's just got back. Hope that everyone in Goa gets home soon, Keep safe."
"I've been watching this post with interest. Typical Baresi, thought provoking and well constructed.We have several friends stuck in South Goa, friends stuck in Mexico and here are we locked down in the UK, so far safe and enjoying getting pensions each month. Our lives are secure providing we stay safe.The travel world in the future? Well, we booked to go to Mexico next winter before all this kicked off. We had kind of fallen out of love with Goa after so many years and decided we needed to get back to real travelling rather than sitting in a beach shack gossiping and reading. As people have said, we’re lucky as our pensions will keep dropping into our banks and we feel very sorry for people that have lost so much. We’re also lucky that we have kids that, so far, are secure so we have nothing to worry about. However, nobody knows where this will all end or, in fact, will it end. Governments across the globe are going to be broke because they are bailing out so many people. Businesses will go broke. People will go broke. Families will go broke. Maybe our pensions are not secure if everything and everybody is going broke. Where we all go from here is very scary.We’re both ‘glass half full people’ so we’re optimistic about the future and that’s how we should all be thinking. For some, Goa next season, for us Mexico, back to rucksacks and on the local buses and for others travel sometime when they can afford it.Stay positive, stay safe and stay upbeat……it’s how humans have learnt to survive things like the Wall Street Crash, WW1, WW2 and The Cold War. There’s a song by Chumbawamba from 1997, ‘I Get Knocked Down’ or ‘Tubthumping’……..it reminds me of my dad who died when it was in the charts,…………………………. ‘I get back up again’!!!!"
"All very fair points itcanbedone; you are indeed correct pensions and pension pots may well be affected; pension payments may well be reduced and for some, unfortunately time is running out ""to get back up again"".A lot of plans people had may well now be scuppered; for the time being.Stay safe, keep well."
"This pandemic will only end when a vaccine is found, estimations are that will be a year to 18 months, until such times stringent measures will need to be in place to restrict mass gatherings and travel. Everything else is just futile and not worth considering. Expect this will take at least a decade before the global economy returns to anything like it was pre Corona too.Edited: 10:23 am, April 02, 2020 "
"BS64; unfortunately, you may well be correct. India in general is in a particularly bad situation; with this issue just starting for them. Many towns and small villages will be drastically affected by this virus and will take many years to recover as will the rest of the world.Next season will definitely not be happening, in my opinion and it will be a few seasons before anything resembling normality will return.Stay safe, keep well and if anyone gets the chance to get out and return to their own country - take it.Edited: 12:26 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Chief Minister of Goa Pramod Sawant on Thursday said that the state is in a safe zone in light of the surging Coronavirus cases in the country, provided the report of Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation attendees turns out to be negative. Speaking to news agency ANI, Sawant said, ""We are in safe zone provided the 46 cases that had come from Nizamuddin are negative.""Earlier on Thursday, the Chief Minister had said that the government was yet to ascertain whether they had attended last month's religious congregation at Delhi's Nizamuddin area, which has emerged as one of the coronavirus hotspots of the country. ""The state machinery has identified 46 members of Tablighi Jamaat, who had travelled to Delhi last month,"" he said.Tablighi Jamaat has damaged the country'The Chief Minister said that none of these individuals are originally from Goa, but belong to different states. ""These people had travelled to Delhi before March 15,"" he said. The Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi emerged as a hotspot for COVID-19 after many positive cases from across India were linked to the gathering, including deaths in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana.On Wednesday, Sawant had said, ""The Tablighi Jamaat has damaged the country, according to the media reports which I have seen. They have put the country in trouble by the manner in which they allowed COVID-19 to spread.""As many as 400 coronavirus patients have been found whose epidemiological linkage can be traced to the Tablighi Jamaat cluster at Nizamuddin, the Centre said on Thursday."
"I think we have now gone past the point of where it came from; it is now the here and now and how to minimise the spread of the virus..Stay safe, keep well."
"""Next season will definitely not be happening, in my opinion and it will be a few seasons before anything resembling normality will return.""An expert speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme a few days ago stated that it was likely that the virus could be an annual event. Let's just hope that a vaccine is available some time soon, I can't see unilateral self isolation working in some of India's overcrowded cities. How would it be possible?A friend of mine commentated on the number of Italians who have died from the virus saying that in many instances the Italian Families all live together in one house often of 4 generations, so children go to school, mix with other children, parents and grandparents go to work and mix with other workers etc, whereas in UK we usually have just 2 generations. He also said that the Italians are always kissing each other - didn't Mussolini snog everyone? I've paid my deposit of £500 to TUI for CSM in November of this year. I'd like to think the holiday went ahead but I can't see it happening."
"Yes MMS, I feel the worst for India, for exactly the same reasons you have stated; cramped living conditions; the inability / impossibility to self isolate and the lack of hospitals and equipment.I really do hope that I am wrong.Stay safe, keep well."
"I didn`t think Goa attracted Chinese tourists either ( having been regular since 1994/5 ). However, last April there was a party of about 20 Chinese tourists in a shack near the Leela. They appeared to be determined to rid the country of Budweiser and as they finished each bottle threw it over their shoulders into the sand. Inscrutable, y`know!"
