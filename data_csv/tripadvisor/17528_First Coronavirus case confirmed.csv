"Now that the first case has been confirmed, is anyone else cancelling their travel plans to the DR? Frankly, I believe there is a greater chance of catching the Virus in the US. It’s the health care system/ corruption that makes me not want to travel. We were scheduled to be in Punta Cana 3/7-3/15."
"If you catch it there, you're unlikely to show symptoms until you've returned home, so don't worry about the health care system there.Mark"
We're scheduled to be there 3/6 to 3/16 and while I'm less worried about actually catching the virus or getting sick - i'm more worried about getting stuck in the DR for 14+ days. We've got a 2 year old and a 4 year old - I can't imagine being holed up in a hotel room or hospital room until we get the all clear. Even flying home - if anyone on the flight shows symptoms - I'm guessing they'd quarantine the whole plane?also - for example - my 2 year old has a fever today. She was throwing up last night and seems to have a stomach bug. If we were travelling today - would they even let her on a plane? quarantine her? I think the test is expensive and takes a while to get results. Kids get fevers pretty often - either one of mine can come down with a fever during the week we're there from any number of reasons.I'm not sure what we should do at this point.I wonder which hotel the guy was who has it...
Has a case been confirmed?
<< Has a case been confirmed? >>Yeshttps:/…Angie.
Thanks Angie.
Agree with what is being said. The risk of being stuck in DR is a big factor
"Gosia4, if your baby is sick, you won't be allowed on the plane. This is second hand information but I've heard that airports are on the look out for any symptoms. You could be pulled aside for just coughing.If you travel with a young child, my advice is to be prepared. Bring a months worth of extra necessities. It's a tough call. I think many people are wondering what to do. No one wants to end up in a quarantine situation."
"I’m not canceling but boy it’s only a matter of a few weeks when at least 80-90% of all countries around the world have at least a few cases.. bring your immune system fighters, exercise, hand sanitizer, and don’t panic. Remember, it’s mostly affecting those of advance age (50+) with a weak or fragile immune system.. otherwise you should be fine and likely to recover if you do by any chance contract something. DR’s warm tropical climate should help it, but scientists are still investigating this."
"I definitely feel I have the same chance of catching it here vs there and I agree - it'll be everywhere in a few months, there really is no getting away from it. hopefully the panic will die down.We're all relatively healthy and I'm sure we'd be ok as far as the virus goes (or as ok as with any flu in any given year). it's being stuck in one room with 2 little kids in a quarantine situation with no home comforts that would probably kill us loland now i'm not sure they'd even let us fly - the chances of one or both kids having a runny nose, fever, cough - very likely at any given time between september and may pretty much.and I agree - sun and salt water cures most ills - i so hate to even consider cancelling as we only go on one trip a year and we were so looking forward to it... ugh. I wish we had booked our trip for a few weeks earlier and had been back by now.Edited: 1:18 pm, March 01, 2020 "
HiWe have 35 confirmed cases here in the UK
My understanding is that tourists in Punta Cana are mostly US and Canada citizens. I could be wrong. Anybody knows if it is a popular place for tourists from Italy? We are travelling during the March break from Canada. I believe there would be a lot of families with kids from Canada. I would not worry too much about the virus for now.
"Did a little research and Italians are not in the top 11 for DR tourists visitation. Plus even prior to this first case, the DR had already confirmed not taking any more planes from Milan, Italy. I’m sure after this, they’ll close a few other doors.. that Italian man is an older gentleman and had been quarantined for a few days already and is said to be recovering. So no need for mass panics. The DR had invested a few million dollars in prior weeks in preparation for this. Let’s leave it in God’s hand and remain calm. But absolutely do what’s best for your family."
"our hotel last year (the same one we're headed to this year) had majority Russian tourists from what I could tell. Smaller groups of other Europeans/South Americans and American/Canadians.You say he was quarantined for a few days - that's the part that scares me. Would they quarantine a family of 4 separately? all together? what if just my husband and me were quarantined? so many unknowns... and there's no set guidelines yet since everyone's figuring this out as they go.i also don't know what we'd do if we were locked in a room for 3,4,7 days with 2 toddlers who have nothing to do or play with... so it's just a matter of keep researching and then make a decision. by friday..."
"What I think is good advice: swab down trays, seats, belt with alcohol disinfectant on plane. Who know where it has been and who sat in your seat for hours."
I'm supposed to book for May
Arriving March 3-12 -not changing our plans.
"Was there in 2017 were many people from Europe, Germany, France. I am supposed to book the Domenica for May. I may wait on it because I don't want to waste time with dealing with insurance company on canceling."
Arriving 3/3 as well. Looking forward to hearing a lot more details but are very much thinking of cancelling.
"Wife and I arrive in PC Thursday, not cancelling. We are healthy and will take our chances and deal with whatever happens. C'est la vie."
I will not cancel my trip in October this is one isolated incident and we’ll see what happens but right now the Dominican republic government to do the right thing I’m not letting cruise ship dock. So I’m going in October anyway for 10 beautiful days
"We are leaving Saturday for a week, I have no intention of canceling our family trip, nor does my sister who is an RN. I feel as there is minimal reason for concern."
"We leave two weeks from today from a country that has TEN TIMES the number of confirmed cases and where at least 17,000 people have a much worse than coronavirus strain of influenza. No intention of cancelling in the least. If I worried about everything that might happen while traveling, I’d never leave my house."
"Yeah the virus itself - if you're gonna catch it, you'll catch it anywhere.My biggest concern is quarantine - how, where, why, how long....I'm worried any cough or fever will send us into quarantine, either in the DR or on the flight there/back and I'm not sure how any of that works. Especially travelling with little kids, who catch coughs, sniffles and fevers from anything - not even the coronavirus - when does a fever warrant a quarantine? and how does that work?how long does the test take? I'm not sure there are answers yet but I keep searching for stories that explain the quarantine situation specifically.my son gets runny noses and coughs ALL the time in the winter months - my daughter is currently fighting a stomach bug, but she has a fever - she's gotten stomach bugs in mexico before - she had vomiting and a fever - if this happens while we are there, what would happen? and again - no one knows yet, but I'd appreciate updates as info becomes available."
"I am a manger for almost all of the UK’s travel insurance company's that come with your UK bank accounts such as Aviva, HSBC, Barclays, TSB, AXA etc. As long as you have decent travel insurance any quarantine should be classed as a medical emergency (dependant on policy terms) and the insurance should pay for all your extra accommodation, daily monetary benefit and your flights home, best advice I can give is purchase good travel insurance. I fly out on my own this Thursday for 9 nights.Edited: 4:19 pm, March 01, 2020 "
ONE case. ONE. Sorry but i know that people are worried. So stay home if it is that distressing for you (chances are that there are cases close to your home also!) We are booked again for May. We MAY need to cancel but if we do..it will not be because of this virus..it will be because my Full time employee that leaves us every summer to go work in Digby NS may have to leave early to secure her summer job before returning to me in Oct lol.. and my summer girls (students studying in other cities) are not home until late may early june.Thank god for cancel for any reason insurance lol.. that being said.. i hope we are able to make our may trip and right now looking for the deals coming for 2 weeks in January!
I wonder what percentage of people who are scared shirtless about contracting coronavirus got a regular flu shot this year.
"RJP-NJ exactly. And how many of these people invest in travel insurance, medical, trip interruption and cancel for any reason? We are booked for May ... a lot can happen in 2 months but we are covered ......"
"Most people I talk to aren't scared of the virus itself - regular flu kills way more people every single year - but with all the hype lately, I'm more worried about getting stuck somewhere. It impacts jobs, school, etc. And with airports and hotels being hyper vigilant, I can see a regular cold or flu land you in quarantine and it could take up to 2 weeks to get out and get back home."
Ben - That’s good to know because I paid for our trip on my Barclay’s card!
"I found this out this afternoon while at Playa Macao. It was a matter of time as is the case with almost all countries. WHO protocols have been in place for about a month.Many here have expected this to occur, but go about their day to day lives, much like most of you back home, but being extra vigilant with personal hygiene.As a guest to any country, or simply for your fellow countrymen and women please do the same.Edited: 5:50 pm, March 01, 2020 "
I believe I read it was an Italian national in Santo Domingo - will airlines refund if there is a travel advisory- been reading on some news media that insurance sometimes don’t cover for pandemic / epidemic -
"He has been quarantined in Santo Domingo and in reports, seems to be in good spirits. Although mentioned that he was in Punta Cana (many generalize the region as PC), more likely in Bayahibe, where the vast majority of Italians visiting the country, vacation."
"assumptions,,Ive met many Italians in PC, ended up in a arm wrestling final against one,anyhow, is it naive of me to find this over blown for regions with one two three or hundred cases?my chances of getting struck by lightning are worse in some areas then getting such virus again my one personal opinion everyone needs to do whats right for their comfort level"
"It would be helpful to know where he was in the country prior to his seeking medical attention. I am presuming he was at a resort. There was another post a couple days ago about the very resort I am scheduled to visit in reference to the virus. I also worry about becoming sick while there for any reason. Where to seek medical help and what would happen next? Everyone says it is only one person....but this virus is known to be very contagious. How many are being monitored? I know this would not be the relaxing, care-free trip I was anticipating."
"As suspected, he was indeed staying in Bayahibe (Dominicus) at Viva (popular with Italians).""The Viva Resorts hotel chain reported on Sunday afternoon that it was one of its hotels that hosted the Italian who tested positive for the coronavirus in the country. He said he acted in accordance with the protocol in coordination with the Ministry of Public Health.He identified the hotel where the 62-year-old man was as Viva Dominicus Beach."""
"Enzo...so is the flu that thousands of tourists inflict on the region every year. This year was especially strong in Bavaro with all of my family and a good number of my friends having 4 or 5 days of downtime.Yet, get away from the tourist zones, and hardly a sniffle reported. It is the price we pay I guess...lol.Edited: 6:52 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Yes as reported, he landed at the La Romana airport and stayed at Dominicus resort in Bayahibe. Then transported to a military hospital in Santo Domingo."
Link to latest article about where he was staying. https:/…
"The flu was bad everywhere this season.. lots of hospitalizations... but no one was sent to a 14 day quarantine... that's my only concern this time around.A few years ago my husband and daughter both came down with something towards the end of our trip in Mexico (probably gastro related) but they both had fevers. My daughter's fever started the day before we were due to leave. no big deal, she pretty much slept on the plane and was fine the next day... but if this happens on this trip, we'd end up not being let on the plane, sent for observation, maybe sent to quarantine- before they determined it wasn't corona and let us go?It's the international freak out that scares me - not getting the flu or even getting corona. Just -how long exactly is my trip gonna end up being and how to prepare for that? other than being hyper vigilant about not catching *anything* while there, in case it's taken to be corona."
I wonder how if resorts are carefully disinfecting rooms after people check out-even more than usual?
"I am still more concerned about the 60% of people, at least in the US, that feel no need to get a flu shot. I am sure many of them will travel sick and many of them could confuse the flu with the corona virus."
"Daisy046how rooms get done will not change,mostly due to the fact that people will complain their room is not ready on time,and these will more than likely be the same people that complain they got sick on vacation,its a lose / lose for the resorts I always take it upon one self well travelling to have cleanliness to your satisfactionfor example can you guess what one of the dirtiest items in any hotel room is, and if you do can you guess why,and lets put it this way, its not in the bathroom"
Can you bring disinfectant sprays like Febreeze To DR? Otherwise I would go to the nearest supermarket and stock up. I’m not worried about this at all. Sounds too much like a bad flu season to worry.
#43 TV remote#44 to the best of my knowledge Febreze is not a disinfectant. Perhaps you are thinking of Lysol. Disinfectant wipes work well but keep in mind that the coronavirus probably only lives on surfaces for a few hours.
No I'm not worried at all.We go 5/30/20
"<< ""#43 TV remote"" >>I have a friend who always brings a ziplock bag on vacation with him for the express purpose of encasing the TV remote during the course of his stay in a hotel.He also breaks the toilet seat the moment he gets in the room. A call down to the front desk results in a maintenance guy showing up with a brand-new-in-the-box toilet seat.I used to think he was nuts. Now I'm thinking he was just a decade or two ahead of his time."
"We are booked March28 -April 4 to Bayahibe..I know that this new case is there, but we are not worried..we keep our plan to go.."
"We are not going to make a decision until closer to October. Noone should knock a personal choice of whether to go or not to go. HOWEVER, Being the mother of 2 and grandmother of 2, imo, it is irresponsible to bring a sick child with fever, throwing up or having green snot(indicative of infection )on an airplane. Period. Hell, even anywhere outside their home.In 2009, we travelled to MX during the swine flu epidemic. MX took the temp of everyone when disembarking the plane. You have a temp, you do not enter MX. We are 11 years older. It is a more difficult decision this time around.Coronsa viruses survive 9 days on hard surfaces. https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2…I purchased Microban, that protects hard surfaces for 24 hours. I bought it last week before price gouging on Amazon. https:/…People are actually contagious a week before they show symptoms.https:/…china-coronavirus-contain.htmlQuarantine in DR...hell no. I don't think my own country is doing enough to protect us. I hope DR can come on top of this as a place that protected its citizens and its tourists, and didn't sweep it under the rug to get that tourist dollar.Edited: 11:19 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"We are traveling to Punta Cana 3/18-3/26 and will not be canceling our travel plans. We're not going to let hysteria ruin our beach vacation. Just like safety, we will be vigilant about washing hands! We refuse to lock ourselves away. Sunshine here we come!"
Maybe drinking Saltine water make you feel better
PrizeI didn't read the article that you stated but the CDC says that the virus lasts for hours on surfaces. I added the word probably because it is so new and I am not taking anything as fact. It doesn't really matter to me because I just assume that every surface contains germs.
"The confirmed case is in Santa Domingo, 2 and half hours drive away from Punta Cana"
"The confirmed case is in Santa Domingo, 2 and half hours Drive from Punta Cana"
Alot more cases confirmed in the US would that stop you traveling to Washington State? I think your chances if catching it is every where!
According to reports the single case of the virus wasn't in Punta Cana but Bayahíbe. It's important to get the facts right and not assume so people don't start panicking without knowing the truth.
Have they announced the port of entry for the one diagnosed case? There are 6-7 airports in DR.
"it is commendable that the resort where this one known individual stayed stepped up and self reported this incident. Transparency and lack of self interest is paramount in getting a handle on this thing. I am leaning towards keeping my trip which begins tomorrow. will keep monitoring and hoping that the full story, or as much is known, is being reported."
"Well, the case is of an ITALIAN tourist; no Dominicans have had symptoms. Now it is to await if he was the Patient Zero of the Caribbean. It is difficult being flu season as well."
"Currently in La Romana, there has been one confirmed case in Santo Domingo. I heard they canceled all Italian flights into La Romana"
"Still traveling this summer. Take precautionary measures.Carry hand sanitizer and use napkins, tissues to handle eating utensils at buffets"
My husband and I leave Sunday for punta Cana. We r not cancel our vacation
"It wasn't in Punta Cana, it was in Bayahibe a town about 1 hour away. #facts"
I am travelling to Punta Cana with 4 others the 24th of March for 11 days. We still plan on going. One of our travellers is an 84 year old who used to be a nurse and she is still going.
"We are going from Mar 9-16....have no plans to cancel. The chances are so small. Use common sense; lots of hand sanitizer and good hygiene. If anything, the lineups will be shorter if people cancel....lol"
This is our 4th year in a row that we are going to Punta Cana. I never worry about corruption. Are you not staying at a resort?
I know viva Wyndham dominicus beach put out a statement saying there was someone at that resort
Just come back from PC. Go and enjoy yourself.
We were just in the DR from 2/18 to 2/25. 3 couples and none of us got sick. We even traveled through ATL. Wash hands and be cautious of what you touch. Take hand sanitizer and wipes. I think you will ne fine. We all came back completely healthy.
"I'm here now in DR Punta Cana Circle by Melia. Everything is fine. I believe if you're going to contract the Coronavirus its going to be in the States. I'm more afraid of coming back home to Brooklyn, NY. Enjoy your vacation"
"Sounds like your really concerned, Persoanlly after reading I can't imagine you having a good time maybe pass until things blow over or get better. If you weren't looking for an opinionan please ignore! We are hear right now and where supposed to go to a kids school off resort to do a pizza lunch we got word we need to post phone as lots of schools closed do to the controvirus scare, the one we were supposed to go was open but only had 8 kids we are told that might be because of the rain this morning."

Screw any place where multi populous contact is ... thats whats gonna spread this is community contact. Stay away from social situations
So far the virus in DR is being contained correctly and no other suspicion has been detected.
I have my trip planned for 7/25 so I’m not cancelling as of yet I will be waiting closer to the date. Hopefully everything and everyone will be cleared by then.
Take the vacation! Here now and all is well.
There where 3 croatians and 1 dominican that went through testing and the results came back negative so in reality there hast been any cases.
"Let's be accurate, the news last night was that a man travelling from Italy was identified with symptoms at his hotel in Bayahibe on Feb 25 and placed in quarantine. It was confirmed as Coronavirus. But it was in La Romana, not Punta Cana. The full story is online. Remember about 30000 people have died from influenza this winter and most others. Did that stop you from travelling?"
"We just got back from Punta Cana 2 weeks ago and all was well. If it’s a single case I think I’d go- depends if you’re comfortable. We have a trip planned to Italy with about 1600 confirmed cases. That, I’m worried about. I’d say you may want to do usual precautions. When flying I now sanitize our seats and tray table area, wash hands, bring fever reducer and hand sanitizer. Probably fine."
"World...you were to be with me. The reason for only 8 or 9 kids at the school this morning was due to the torrential rains this morning more than coronavirus. As I mentioned...think of a snow day in Canada. There was flooding all over the place. My daughter's school, (private and international) decided to suspend classes for the day. This is not mandated.As I mentioned, morning rain was the reason for the low attendance...some areas I drove through had 1.5 feet of water."
I would still go...use hand sanitizer and wash hands...go and enjoy
"We canceled our flight...3/3 - 3/10 for DR, after much deliberation. We're in our 70's and if I need to be quarantined, I'd rather be stateside. We really don't know HOW many cases there actually are...rather be safe than sorry."
"I’m traveling from the 5th to 10th to punta cana. I am not cancelling. I’m alittle concerned but honestly I think this virus is a bit over exaggerated. So I’ll just do my normal preventives. Take airborne, wash hands, etc"
Viva Dominicus Beach hotel in La Romana just seen it is this hotel
No way will we cancel our trip in 22 days unless the government say so.we would loose all our money if we decided to not go.
"Hi#2 gosia4, I'm also concerned about 'quarantine'.Now that there's a confirmed case on a resort what is the protocol? will it be business as usual, allow people off the resort, allow them to travel home on scheduled flights? Or will there be a quarantine period in DR? Also once back home will there be a quarantine? After seeing how they quarantined the people on the cruise ship, (on ship and again in US/Canada) it will be interesting to see how this unfolds. Currently in Toronto confirmed cases are sent home to do quarantine, so maybe things are settling in that aspect.Thanks and Happy Safe travels to all!Edited: 12:40 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Lab, First the Italian guest was not staying in Punta Cana he was staying in Dominicus which is an hour away and flew into the La Romana International airport not Punta Cana. He was also removed from the resort and is in quarantine at the San Isidro Airbase military hospital getting treatment. From published reports his symptoms are mild but he was running a fever prior to his arrival which has since stabilized according to published reports.https:/…"
"yup - I'm with you - the virus is going around the world you're gonna get it or you're not, you take extra precautions and go on with your life.... but how to plan for a quarantine? will they let people leave? will hotels be on lockdown?I'm ok with self quarantine once I get home but my worry is getting stuck somewhere.I have heard that some cruise folks and a hotel in tenerife were quarantined on the ship or at the hotel for 14 days - then had to do another 14 days once they got to their destination at a military base - so we're talking 28 days out of work, no pay... would our jobs even be there when we got back?Also - what if we get sick with any other illness that causes a fever? will we be quarantined anyway until they give us the all clear?It's all these things that worry me - not the virus itself. They seem to be letting people self quarantine at home so that's more doable since me and my husband could both potentially work from home if needed, there's food delivery in our area and friends and family to help drop off supplies etc etc. but that's assuming they'd let us go home...Edited: 12:54 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"<< “use hand sanitizer and wash hands“ >>Do note that most hand sanitizers -- Purel, etc — are antimicrobial (ie they kill bacteria) but they are NOT antiviral. (ie they will NOT kill a virus.)Washing hands is better, because rubbing your hands together under flowing water will/may physically wash away any virus particles. But gel-type hand sanitizer will simply move any virus particles around on your hands... and leave them there.Alternatively, wipes such as Lysol and Clorox labeled as killing both bacteria and virus will do the trick. Just be sure to wash hands and moisturize after using as they will dry your hands out pretty good.Edited: 12:58 pm, March 02, 2020 "
Full story here of DR protocol regarding traveller with virus https:/…
Or being quarintened when returning to the US
"thanks for the link hereandthere - it looks like the hotel isn't on lockdown, but people who 'were in contact with him' are 'under observation' - whatever that means... probably quarantined... most likely won't be allowed to fly out until they're given the all clear - which is what? 14 days?So that's my risk weighing at the moment - not am I gonna get coronavirus or not - how likely are we to get quarantined, especially travelling with 2 little kids who pick up sniffles/coughs/fevers at the drop of a hat? If one of us gets sick there - for any reason - corona or otherwise - it could lead to up to 28 days of quarantine... if anyone at the hotel comes down with corona and we were in contact with them in any way - we could be looking at quarantine as well, whether we have any illness or not..."
Im going to book last minute was planning on early May. Who knows what going to happen. I may even get a really good deal because we are flexible.
While the reason why is not specifically known but thus far of the 90K cases of the coronavirus none have been detected in children. They seem to be immune from the coronavirus for some reason. I would say your risk is fairly low if you are not staying at the Viva Beach resort that the man was staying at. If you are booked there I would rebook to another resort.
"<< “ They seem to be immune from the coronavirus for some reason.” >>Will sound semantic, but rather than “immune” their presentation is likely merely “sub-clinical” essentially.Most kids are “otherwise healthy” and can fight off most bacterial and viral insults. Most of the reports of people getting really sick and dying seem to be folks who are older and/or otherwise unhealthy from the start.Edited: 1:52 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"travelling_wilkdcat - yup - children are less affected by corona - but what if they get a fever in general? not corona - but they have a fever during our trip which happens - cold be gastro related, could be sniffles they've brought back from Chicago (flu is currently going around their school).... wouldn't they get sent to quarantine? have to wait to be tested? would we get stuck for 14 days?(and i'm not saying you have an answer - i'm just saying my worry is not corona - but getting stuck for any reason due to the hysteria around corona)Edited: 1:54 pm, March 02, 2020 "
You need a hospital-grade sanitizer which contains from 70% to 95% alcohol to kill coronavirus. You can't usually buy these at the supermarket.Purell actually contains 70% alcohol formulation and is suited and used for frequent use by hospital staff.Check out this article.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_sanitizerAngie.
"Hi again, #92 that link was very helpful! So it appears they're not following the same protocol as the cruise ship...those infected I believe were removed and put in quarantine, yet the rest of the Travelers had to stay 14 days there and 14 days back at home in a facility.Maybe they've calmed down on the quarantine. But I agree what does the article mean by those in contact? Maybe they're just monitoring those in his group. Will be interesting to see if anybody does get quarantined other than him.But as others have pointed out this is not the Punta Cana airport or Resort, so maybe that helps put your mind at ease somewhat. We haven't booked yet, we're hoping to get away in mid-April.All the best!"
The case was in Laromana and it was a visitor from Italy
I'm also considering and cancelling my travel plans. I'm do to be in Punta Cana 3/20-3/26
We leave tomorrow; see you there.
You should go !! Enjoy life

The case confirmed was a man at the viva whyndam Dominicus beach in Bayhibe and this person flew through La Romana airport not Punta Cana . This virus do not like the heat is killed in temps of 23 plus. We will still be going to Punta Cana next month but with excercise proper hand washing use sanitizer wipes on the plane to wipe dont table trays etc and clean hands with sanitizer besides hand washing and of course keep our hands away from our face
Which hotel ate you going too
Was a story about a family that was kicked off a flight for the same thing few days ago. Even though they had the green light to travel from the doctor. This whole thing is getting ridiculous now.
"Gosia4- it’s scary- I understand your worries. When my kids had a sniffle they always have a fever . Hopefully health professionals will tell the difference between the two. We head to the Caribbean in 19 days ( Cuba) my Hope is that with the very few cases in the Caribbean ( 1 in DR , 5 in Mexico ) that the chances are not very high . Remember 90% of these case are in China , and mainly isolated to Wuhan . For now I’m content with my vacation plans and packing while we speak ;) I wish you all the best ! Que sera sera"
We are traveling to Punta Cana 3/8-16. Still going!
No I'm travelling out from the uk on the 18 for a week to punta cana . If you get the virus you get it . You can pick it up anywhere
"hereandthere - yeah i'm hoping that once you have a fever, they can test you to see if it's corona or not. I think that by the time you have symptoms you should be testing positive for it. I'm not sure how long it takes to get results either.I think the hard part is the 14 days between - so say you come in contact with it, you might test negative up to 14 days and then you're suddenly positive. I think that's where the quarantine situation comes into play.So hopefully no one at my resort gets it so that we're not all quarantined waiting to be released.Seriously - my biggest fear about this whole thing is being locked in a hotel room with 2 kids for 14 days (!) There's only so many ways to keep kids entertained in a hotel room....I can do a quarantine at home no problem... we've got toys, internet, space to move around, I can work from home if I had to etc. so no real fear of losing one's job or whatever....as of now - we're still planning on heading out this friday 3/6. We're going to Punta Cana and planning on being extra vigilent. I'm hoping the sun and salt water keeps everything else at bay and no one gets food poisoning or any kind of cough/sniffles so we aren't accidentally lumped into supected coronavirus territory.as you say - que sera, sera"
Just got back from Punta Cana.So far so good and no one is wearing masks or even talking about it. Even at the airport in Toronto few are in masks.
Which resort was it?
Hi LucyP - were there any extra checks going on at either airport or at the resort? temperature taking or that sort of thing?

Just got back...all good there so far. Have a great time!
"Post #105 / Caribbean Junky<<10,000 people died in the USA and over 600,000 were hospitalized from the common flu last year. Where is the hysteria and the outrage by the everybody about that! Come on people do not let the Mainstream Media scare you with their politically driven propaganda. Just use common sense and if you do not have an then become a member of the mainstream media.>>I don't get it either, and can't find a reasonable explanation?"
"<< “ I don't get it either, and can't find a reasonable explanation?” >>Fear of the unfamiliar. Everyone knows what “the flu” is and many/most have had it at some point in the past... and didn’t die. And everyone knows someone else who had the flu at some point in the past... and didn’t die. And there has never been every news station running a minute-by-minute tally of the number of cases of the regular flu.So, while people understand intellectually that “the flu” is bad... it is at least familiar. For hundreds of millions of people, their own personal experience with the flu tends to be “meh... kinda sucks, but doesn’t seem to be THAT bad.”But corona virus is unknown. You’ve not had it. You don’t’ know anyone who has had it. The only news you are exposed to involves growing numbers of cases from one minute to the next, how many people are quarantined, what the latest death toll is.There’s little wonder that the reaction to Coronavirus is different to the seasonal flu.Edited: 5:49 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Debinatore, I think there are different fears growing. Fear of catching it and not surviving (unlikely), fear of quarantine (could happen), fear of being responsible for spreading it-youncould have it and not show symptoms for 14 days . During that time you could transmit it to someone with a chronic disease or the elderly. I will travel to PC next week with only 1 case reported so far, but I wouldn't go to Italy. I will wipe down my seat, food tray, etc. On the plane. I will use purel often. I have heard that the heat and sun are good breeding grounds-really don't know if that is true.Edited: 5:58 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"One case in the whole country. Some cases in my city let alone many in my country. With public transportation, working in government buildings etc, I would take my chances in PC more than here."
"It has also been confirmed Coronavirus in NY, so it might be an issue if you travel to any country of the world https:/…coronavirus-new-york.amp.html"
The virus doesn’t survive much at hot temperatures
I would not want to be at any resort while this virus is spreading. People from around the world going to resorts and spreading their germs and viruses. No thanks!
Just like home...eh Roger? Unless you live in Antarctica.
"Daisy, thanks for the response. ... what I meant was, how is this virus any different, better, worse than all the other flues? Why is this one scarier, feared more, in the news more, than all the other flues that have killed or will kill thousands more?What am I missing?Edited: 7:19 pm, March 02, 2020 "
To understand that Deb. It would get really political.. Also 24 hr news has become a social plague.. they grab onto something .. sensationalize it. And run with it as long as they can Heck. Think back not long ago they had us all perishing in WW3My opinion is all
"Northern, that was my point LOL.... and my take on it thus far is the same as yours :-)"
"As I said, we are due to be in DR on March 28th, even more then that, flying to La Romana, for one of the resorts in Bayahibe. Are we a little worried? I would lie if I say no, so yes the worries are somewhere in the back of our minds..Are we going to cancel? Absolutely not..but again this is a personal choice, not saying that either cancelling or going is a good or bad choice, everybody needs to see what's best for themselves..I am from Ontario , Canada, the number of cases are going up by each day, so speaking for myself, I am more worried here, then I would be over there..So we are going to be there in the end of March and enjoy the DR vacation, our favorite place.."
"Way to go Daniela,,,, happy travels"
"As a Health care provider and related to the Caribean Island.Wanted to stress the point that this not the time to travel to Hawaii, Tahiti,Punta Cana ,or the North Pole.Stay at home, Pray,protect yourself , family and neighbors, and ask for wisdom from above."
Just go. We are going April 10-17th. The media is trying to make us panic. See the stock market the past week? Stocks are dumped and guess what ? They will be bought for pennies on the dollar and money will be made once it all dies down. And the big plus for Pharma? A new vaccine perhaps?? Mo money!! It’s a shame that the poor souls who passed away did but it was the same with SARS. Enjoy your vacation!

I’m booked for April 10th and can’t wait
"Angel, you and I both know this isn’t anything but a bad flu. Of course, if you’re older (55-60+) with a weak immune system and prone to always getting sick.. then by all means stay home and far away. Otherwise, you’ll mostly like be good and even if by any chance you catch the virus, you’ll more than likely survive."
I'm not going untill october. So I'm wait
"Agreed. I am going March 4-11. It seems silly to worry about Covid19 with only on case in the D.R. reported. I don't believe it was in Punta Cana, but less crowded means it will be nicer for us that go."
My daughter went from 2-22 Thur 2-27 so far so good
"My sister and I are due to fly out for two weeks on the 19th April. I am 75 and my sister almost 82. We are so looking forward to it, staying at a 5* hotel. I really don't know what to do"
If your kid is throwing up at the airport and people see it it's possible you could get denied boarding if someone complains. I red the test is $3500 but has to be approved by the CDC before its given as there are not many tests available. Things change daily so who knows if you will get quarantined or allowed there or back.
I am getting over the flu and flew today with a cough across country.
Which is nothing if you think about the population #.
Does anybody know exactly where this case was. Was it discovered at a hotel. Was it a local person or tourist. And is there only one case. .?
"Just to let you know guys that case was not confirmed in punta cana also is just one case, remember DR is not an asiatic country to flights to be canceled is less likely you get the corona virus there is easier to get it here in the USA"
"Pisceanlady,As previously posted from my post #116 on this thread it was Viva Dominicus Beach Hotel in Bayahibe.https:/…Angie."
"Really ? Is anybody more concerned over a vacation, or the health of them, their Family's,and all people they come in contact with.That is so wrong,& selfish. considering under the circumstances, cancel most airlines cruise ships will accept reschedule,also I would think, the company they work for would not have issues with changing the vacation, rather than risk a employee bring the virus to their workplace. Again is it worth your life?"
This is false news. There has been only one confirmed case in La Romana. THERE IS NO CORONAVIRUS CASE IN PUNTA CANA.
There is NO CORONAVIRUS case in Punta Cana.
There is NO confirmed Coronavirus case IN PUNTA CANA. The only confirmed casa was an Italian who flew in from Italy and was staying in La Romana and he did NOT fly to the Punta Cana International Airport. There are no direct flights from Italy to Punta Cana International Airport.
Not in Punta Cana. One case was confirmed in La Romana.

Going in May with no hesitation...people need to take a breath and just be careful
We leave in 6 days for our PC vacation. No plans to cancel as I feel the risk is still pretty low at this point.
"This case is in La Romana, NOT in Punta Cana."
"This confirmed casa of Coronavirus is in La Romana, NOT IN PUNTA CANA."
"Yes, NOT IN PUNTA CANA. But in La Romana. This Italian Tourist DID NOT arrive to the Punta Cana International Airport. There are NO DIRECT flights from Italy to PUJ."

You are pretty much right on your thoughts. We will always be welcome to DR now or when you decide to come. One case of a Italian visitor does not tell the country is in dangerous but any fligth from Italy have been cancel an the visitor in observation an treatment by the health ministerial. Thanks
I cant believe anyone is even taking a chance of being anywhere especially on a plane. This virus is deadly....da...no brainer.
"<< ""I cant believe anyone is even taking a chance of being anywhere"" >>So where are YOU currently?Nowhere?"
Can’t wait for my April trip! The thought of the quite beaches and peaceful scenery is making me even more excited. Stay home scared folks! I might actually book another trip for late May as well :)
We are arriving March 9-13 and heck no I'm not cancelling. Not overly concerned enough to cancel my vacation. Its everywhere so are we all suppose to bunker down and not leave our house lol.
"Freedom798028 - I get it - this whole virus is being blown out of proportion... but what if someone at your resort is found to have it and you get locked in your room for 14 days because they deem you were in close contact... your beautiful scenery will be of your hotel room walls.I'm still not sure what's going on with the folks who were deemed to be in contact with the italian gentleman - are they quarantined? they said they're 'under observation'... i don't want to spend my vacation locked in a hospital room or a hotel room waiting to see if i'm clear or not...the virus is everywhere - we're pretty much gonna get it or you're not - but how everyone is handling this situation is what concerns me....I also can't find info on how long test results take - how they can distinguish between a regular fever/cough vs corona... it's these unknowns - how will people react if it's found in my hotel, or on my plane....we're still scheduled to go on Friday... unless something drastic happens - we're going.... with 2 kids and me being pregnant.... i didn't travel during zika last time i was pregnant because it specifically had warnings for pregnant women. this time around - there's no specific threat to pregnant women or children so the virus itself, while concerning, is the least of my worries. As I said in a previous post - they look to be quarantining people for 14 days at their destination, then another 14 when you get home... that's 28 days out of work for both me and my husband if they even *think* we have it or came into contact with someone who has it...."
Its all over the The world
I have come from punta cana last week. There was no confirmed case until then. And i don't think there is any need of panicking because you are not exposed to a larger crowd except at the airport.
The remote control
"<< ""The remote control"" >>Would you like to buy a verb?:-)"
Ravinder the one Italian who tested positive for the coronavirus didn't even stay in Punta Cana or fly into the Punta Cana Airport either he flew into La Romana International Airport and stayed at a resort nearby on Dominicus Beach.
"You are right grosia.. listen folks, just do what’s best for you and your family. I’m pretty much self employed so being stuck for 14 days in DR wouldn’t necessarily hurt me as much as others."
Do you think we should cancel I am scheduled to be in Punta Cana this month ..
"There were multiple deaths in DR last year due to bad alcohol, and people still went. Violence in Jamaica and Mexico and people still go. ONE person has it in Dominican and now its panic time?? I don't get the logic. I'm coming in from Ontario Canada in April, we have 20 cases here, Going through my own airport would of higher cause for concern than being down there and even that is low risk. Probably have a higher risk of a car accident on the way to the airport. LOLThe Media has a field day with such things, and by panicking, all we do is feed into it."
"turnbud - not everyone's panicking because of the virus. some of us are concerned with a ruined vacation spent in quarantine in your hotel room or on an army base... if anyone at your resort has it or is suspected - you might be quarantined. That could extend your stay significantly and add costs and inconvenience. They're stopping flights to some stricken areas - Dominican isn't yet 'stricken' - it's one case... but if in the next few weeks the cases multiply - you could potentially get stuck there indefinitely... the worldwide reaction to this has me worried.... not the risk from the virus itself.Lots of us are coming from areas that have it - if anyone develops symptoms while there - quarantine.... and anyone who was in contact with that person as well....Edited: 4:43 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"<< ""There were multiple deaths in DR last year due to bad alcohol, "" >>That just ain't true, however."
"Just like last year, media speculation and uninformed panic sets in and folks just get nervous. Do what's best for you and your family but before cancelling and loosing your hard earned $$$, get accurate information. If anything, the DR may be safer than back home in some cases."
"""Can’t wait for my April trip! The thought of the quite beaches and peaceful scenery is making me even more excited. Stay home scared folks! I might actually book another trip for late May as well :)""If quiet beaches are your preference you made a very silly choice by picking PC as your destination! Do some research next time."
There are actually many quiet beach areas around the whole PC area. Cap Cana and Uvero Alto being 2 areas with limited number of resorts and foot traffic.
"gosia4 - I just want to say that I understand your concerns, completely. I don't have answers for you but your concerns are legitimate. It's the unknown reaction from governments (both DR and any country of origin)and resorts that's the biggest concern to me, as well."
I’m not concerned about this media hyped virus at all. I’m just getting over the flu....and thousands die from that every year. And yes.... I had the flu shot. But.... I’ve been to the DR five times and it’s the last place I’d want to get critically sick ! I had an allergic reaction at a five star resort and they were a joke at treating me. So scary! I couldn’t imagine developing a serious respiratory illness and need urgent care!! Not in the DR. Now that would be a mortality number. Staying out of dr until this has settled down and been contained. Aiming for this fall.
"Arrived today. My Southwest flight was nearly full. No masks, didn’t see anyone else wiping down seat, armrests etc. At immigration desk in Punta Cana, two workers were wearing face masks. We are at the Hard Rock. No one seems concerned. So far I haven’t heard any discussions of it. Hand sanitizer at the restaurants is mandatory."
"Enzox2: That is great. Thank you very much for first hand information, please keep us up to date on what is happening."
Travelexinsurance.com check how they coverage your family about cancel/ interruption/ medical issues
Thank you very much for updating.Please please update us while you there My vacation starts 3/16 -3/23
Enzox2: thanks so much for your first hand experience. We are going to Hard Rock in a week. I would appreciate you can give more updates. This is really helpful.Lou
"It was never proven to be the result of bad alcohol, nor did the number of deaths rise in comparison to the years prior to 2019. The deaths were all proven to be natural causes of death. Even the FBI were part of the investigation. That was bad publicity, fake news. Please stop spreading this news!"
"EnzoX2 - thanks for the updates! We're heading next door to you in a couple of days - I'll try to post updates as well.It's been really hard to find hand sanitizer in my area to take with us - as someone who never used it regularly, I don't have any at home.... I'm hoping, as you said, that there's some available in the dining areas.I'm also going to attempt to make my own and put it in little travel bottles.If anyone's interested - it's rubbing alcohol and aloe vera gel (2/3 alcohol with 1/3 aloe). You can also add in a few drops of essential oil for scent. I might actually increase the alcohol to aloe content though since someone on here said it has to be 70% alcohol or higher to kill virus."
"I have the same concerns u have, I don’t want to get stuck out of my own country."
Hey! I feel your concerns. We leave March 31 and I’m scared of getting stuck there. I’m also wondering if they’ll not let planes from the United States come in since it’s spreading here and they were diverting cruise ships. Crazy stuff.
"I really appreciate all the updates from Punta Cana. I have the same concerns everyone has about Corona Virus. My family and my friends will travel to Punta Cana on Mar 30. I hope everyone keeps updating this post. I will update when I am there as well. I hope everyone has a great vacation. We've been working so hard during the year and this is a time for us to refresh ourselves. In the worst case, I will have to cancel my trip, but I will lose all the money I paid for my whole family.Edited: 9:56 am, March 07, 2020 "
Nick N Did you not buy cancellation insurance? Most Canadian tour operators sell cancel for any reason and it is not very expensive. Never travel without it.
If not getting into punta Cana I hope they give you advance notice before we even land the travel agent should know this before time.
I feel the cruise ships are worse since the people are so confined. And I feel bad for the others who are quarentined in those small cabins for weeks. Did one cruise many years ago it's not for me. But everyone has a preference
You are correct with the diy sanitizer I researched it also but then again I always use it
"Caribbean_traveler: My insurance company tells me that my policy in this situations will only cover me if there is a government advisory not to go to DR. I can only imagine how one sneeze or cough at the airport in Canada, DR or at the resort might send people panicking, or perhaps sending me to solitary confinement at the military base in DR. Sorry venting my frustration here, but I am sure these thoughts are shared by many travelers now. Some of us are more brave than others. My brother who just left to Jamaica is having great time there, but I am not that brave."
"Hate to put this news, but Johns Hopkins university website is reporting an additional cases of the Corona virus, don't know where. Now the total is 5.https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
"Canada has 3.5 times the population of the DR, but has more than 12 times the number of cases of the virus. In two weeks, when I go, my worry is not Punta Cana - it's the Toronto airport, and the plane.Mark"
To the OPTheir is no greater chance of getting it in the US than in your own counrty. Do the math and get statistics instead of bashing people from another country!!
"discover12... all I could find online for the other 3 are..""""""Three Dominicans, including a minor, gave positive to the coronavirus reported this morning the minister public health, who pointed out that people returned to the country from Italy, where one of them is a resident and the others had gone on vacation."""""""
Thanks Debinator this is better news they were caught before they pass on their virus.

Vlynson stop fear mongering please. I am going in 2 weeks and no worries at all.
Thank you for this information Debinator. I was looking for info on who the third (out of five) person is and could not find it anywhere . I am booked for April for DR as well. Does anyone know where these three Dominicans were/are located in the DR? Thanks.
we are supposed to leave this SUnday the 15th. My concern is getting stuck there and not allowed to come back to the US
"if Keith Richards get this virus, I may start to worry :)"
"@nycheesehead - I agree. We're supposed to leave Tuesday and still deciding. I'm not necessarily scared of getting sick, but there's SO many other things that can go wrong. 1) We have to pass through 3 different airports and encounter 1000s of people 2) There's a very real chance policies continue to tighten while we're in country and we return to stricter quarantine / border procedures (there's a real chance my daughter is asked to stay home from school for 2 weeks), and 3) the virus is going to continue to spread both in the US and the DR (not here to debate how serious or dangerous it is) and as it is taken more seriously, travel just gets that much more complicated and unnecessary.And now with the US State Departments Level 3 Global Advisory recommending US citizens reconsider travel aboard...I'm not sure what to do. That is a global warning and is not country specific. ""The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of COVID-19. Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions. Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice.""Edited: 9:28 am, March 12, 2020 "
Link - https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Possibly meter results depend on if the country has Covid-19 tests. We are flying TO - PUJ this Saturday. Have been watching stats too. If exposed assuming symptoms show within 14 days. Posts read everything is normal at resorts.
https://do.usembassy.gov/
"one confirmed case as of now yes, but we have no idea if that is the truth. also, it can take up to 14 days to show symptoms and maybe this person infected other before being diagnosed. i’m not saying there will be more cases because i cannot predict the future, but it seems logical to say that there will most likely be a slight increase at least, since this virus is so easily spread. i am going on spring break to punta and i hope that my trip does not get cancelled, but if mine and others well being are to be put at risk, i would rather stay home. and i don’t just mean contracting this virus, it’s also because of the possibility of getting stuck in quarantine over there. also, if i were to get sick, we are only going for a week so i could come home and still not know i have it for a week, unless the proper testing is provided which i hope it is. i am not claiming to know everything about this virus and i may be wrong, i am not a scientist and i have not dealt with covid-19 first hand. but, i do my best to stay away from headlines & read un-biased and credible articles, and i am trying my best as all of you are to stay educated and steer away from ignorance and fear. i hope everyone can have an open mind and be caring and respectful about discussions like these, and please wash your hands :)"
Did you decide to go we are supposed to be going there 3/23 thru 3/30
Does anybody know if Barcello Bavaro is waiving their cancellation fee?
Barriebrian.... are you still going?
"kyjjmom: I was able to negotiate with the hotel directly, not through the agent, to postpone my trip until November, they didn't charge me any penalty or fare change, it was nonrefundable reservation and the hotel was very accommodating. It is not Barcello, sorry I am not at liberty to say which hotel. My suggestion is to reach out to the agent, if not try the hotel directly. My agent told me they cannot do anything. Yes, I do have trip cancellation insurance. The insurance Company told me I am not covered unless an advisory is issued. I also cancelled my plane ticket, will see now if I will get any money back since I have done this before the Government advisory. hope you will be able to do it too."

"Going into week 3 of lockdown...3 more to go!, All seems to be ok, at least in this region. There was no update today, but as of yesterday 35 cases (2.3% of the cases nationwide), which includes the original 5 in Bayahibe and one death (a doctor). I will go shopping on Monday morning, as our food stock is down to rice and pasta, and although I do enjoy pasta...I have had enough! We have had the local mini-market deliver for the past week.The city of Higuey (along with some others) have basically barricaded the roads in, allowing only those who live there to enter along with food and supply trucks.A national curfew is in effect from 5pm to 6am for the next 2 weeks. Those being caught are being put to clean up detail. If you get caught in your car, it is impounded until after the curfew is lifted.As for flights, for the past week, there has been one daily Condor flight out of Frankfurt. Today, 2 JetBlue flights landed...one from San Juan and the other from JFK.

Thanks Mike for the update. many of us are waiting our next vacation to DR. So we hope all go well so we can once again go back to normal. Please give us periodic updates whenever you can. Thanks again.
Just reading through these replies & what absolutely amazes me is the number of people who were concerned about catching the virus or being quarantined in the DR but very few seem to have been worried about carrying it to the DR or anywhere else. It has been clear for weeks now that this is a worldwide pandemic & no country will escape the effects of it & nobody should even think of travelling for a good few months now.
"Thomasgran: You are absolutely right, but remember that the focus of this forum is exchanging ideas about if we should travel at this time to DR. I have been to DR many many times, I have seen the bonds many of us has established with the locals and how they treat us as family and how the many of us appreciate and respect them for making us feel at home. Yes, we do care about not taking the virus to DR and the well being of our friends the Dominicans even if this is lost in the thread of this forum. We wish them the best and we are sorry that we have brought this virus to them. Hope this will be over soon, so we can again enjoy their wonderful friendship. Thanks for bringing this point to the forum."
