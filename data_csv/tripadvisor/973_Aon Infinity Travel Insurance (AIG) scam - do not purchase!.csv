"Purchased a flight on American Airlines, through Expedia, and opted for the AON Infinity Travel Insurance. Had to make a simple scheduling change 72 hours later – same airline, same passenger, same departing/arriving airports - and of course, AON Infinity Travel Insurance / AIG Travel Insurance denied any coverage.American Airlines wasn’t losing any business, this was just a date change - DENIED!It would have been the same outcome if I had not purchased the insurance at all. So, purchasing AON Infinity Travel Insurance (AIG) is totally worthless.Insurance companies don’t stay in business by paying out for claims, and AON Infinity Travel Insurance (AIG) is no different.If you pay, 99.9% chance you will be denied for any claim filed, no matter what the reason. Horrible companies, horrible coverage."
"Highly doubt it's a ""scam."" You have to file a claim for a covered reason. I have purchased many travel insurance policies from several different companies, and none included coverage because I just wanted to change travel dates.I have also filed claims for covered reasons, and have always received payment. Your statement, ""if you pay, 99% chance you will be denied for any claim filed, no matter what the reason,"" is just coming from your anger, it has no basis in reality."
"Why did you make the change and was that reason covered by the policy? Did you read the terms of the policy before purchasing?Edited: 8:23 am, January 26, 2020 "
"You would need to try claims 100 times to suggest 99% refusal. 1000 times for your 99.9% mention.The insurance may stink, it may not, but exaggeration doesn’t help, and posting such limited facts (like skipping WHY you wanted to change) does no one any good"
"Lemme guess, you actually have no idea what the insurance you purchased actually was for, but you thought you had found a hack so that you could get the benefits of a flexi ticket, without actually having to pay for it, instead you thought you only had to pay a small deposit for the insurance premium and would reap the benefits of getting a much more expensive flexi ticket by making a claim from the insurance.Just a guess of course lol"
"American Airlines wasn’t losing any business, this was just a date change - DENIED!----A simple flight on the same day between cities A and B can vary in price,.Saw some flight between Toronto and Newark..they ranged from about $250 to $900 depending on flight time during the day .Buying insurance does not mean you can changes times and dates at your convenience without shelling our money for the fare differential. Learn what a product is before you buy it."
Travel insurance doesn’t usually allow you to make free changes to the flights. It typically covers lots bags and delays. It probably covers cancellation if someone on the ticket can’t travel. You really need to read the policy details.
"I agree that the OP didn't realize that a ""simple scheduling change"" wouldn't necessarily be covered unless it was for a reason covered in the policy. Don't think ""I changed my mind"" will be covered in most policies.It is also correct that not all flights between points A and B will cost the same, so the OP's assumption that AA wasn't losing any business isn't valid. While they may be just shifting a passenger from one flight to another, it doesn't mean there isn't a financial loss for the airline. They could very well have sold the new seat at a higher cost. That's why when you make a change to a non-refundable ticket, there's a fee plus any difference in fare to do so.Again a person with a rant that takes no personal responsibility for not paying attention to and understanding what the insurance he bought covered and didn't cover."
>> 99.9% chance you will be denied for any claim filed <<If you make a claim for something that the insurance policy does not cover then that would be 100% deniedWhat are the insurable events that the policy you chose cover?...they will likely cover change of dates if you have a medical certificate to confirm you are not fit to fly on the intended date and the reason is either not a pre-existing condition or the pre-existing condition has been declared and any increased relevant premium paid....you would need to read the policy details to confirm.The fare rules of the ticket you selected should confirm whether changes can be made and what the cost of those changes would be...often a change fee plus fare difference.
"Methinks then OP read none of the fine print, either for the AA flight or the travel insurance, so had no idea what they were buying. Then, based on own assumption of how you do things, tried to use the insurance to pay for a change that incurred a fee.SWT"
Just another one post wonder who needs to read the definition of scam.
Bob so you did not know what coverage you were purchasing. I know of no company that would cover you for the passenger wanting to change their flight.
"Aon is not a scam: it’s a major insurance company that offers insurance to businesses and individuals in various sectors. This is more a matter of the OP not knowing what insurance is for and the T&Cs of the policy.Edited: 11:14 am, January 26, 2020 "
I’ll fetch the popcorn if the OP ever comes back about this...
"""Insurance companies don’t stay in business by paying out for claims,""i love that comment as it is in direct contravention of what i was told many times when working in insurance.......a company DOES stay in business by paying out claims. that is the reason they exist....well at least any reputable company, such as AON !"
"I have found, after lurking on AT forum, that when the consumer (or poster) failed to understand or read the terms of whatever it is he/she is buying ( be it tickets, insurance, etc.) the famous two words used are Scam and Fraud. Much like Bonnie and Clyde; Beavis and Butthead, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson..."
"I have excellent travel insurance and they have paid out when I was ill and done so within 5 days and didn’t even want to see the medical receipts.A few months ago I decided to alter the date I was travelling back from Australia by one week, same flights, same airline same day, just one week later. Cost me £660 for that change and it was only a few months since I’d booked it with travel 7 months in the future. Just had to suck it up as that was the terms of the ticket. Never occurred to me that my travel insurance would cover me wanting to change the travel date."
"Insurers generally pay out only for events covered by the policy -- I don't know what that policy said, but in my experience the policies I have had would not have reimbursed me for extra costs just because I changed my mind, because changing one's mind was not a covered event under those policies. So moral of this story is you need to read policy.Was this a policy offered as a last minute add on to an Expedia or airline purchase? You need to be careful with those. If you believe their selling language was misleading, or if they did not provide link to official policy, consider complaining to your state insurance commissioner, who regulates the selling of such policies in your state.In the future I recommend buying trip insurance through a comparison site like insuremytrip.com or maybe directly from insurer. Never buy from an airline, ticket seller, travel agent, tour operator,cruise line, etc. In my experience, they provide less coverage at a higher codt."
"instead of - Insurance says 'no'....I better have a close look at the wording of the policy that I purchased....oh dear, they are right, it does not cover what I thought/assumed it did....my fault, will learn for next time to read before purchaseit is a rant about a scam (proving they have still not read it!)"
"I have come to understand, that when a person does not understand something, then they refer to it as a ""Scam""."
"I don’t get it. The OP is probably educated, assume if he can type he can read, but just chose not to.Why do people NOT read before they buy ? and it’s NEVER their responsibility when things go south. Ever.Edited: 10:03 pm, January 26, 2020 "
It's kind of like wanting your auto insurance pay for a robbery in your home.
"You are 100% correct, its a scam. They now claim Corona 19 was foreseen so they are basically telling their policy holders to pound sand!"
When did you buy the policy?
Bought mine two months ago.
"It has been generally accepted in the insurance industry that a date of around 23 January was when when the COVID-19 was a ""known event""."
"Agreed. Travel insurance gives protection for events that could not reasonably have been expected. By late February, any prudent traveller should have foreseen that the virus was likely to cause travel disruption."

"All reasonable and correct comments. S.R - it isn't a scam , I just do not think that you read the terms and conditions of your policy thoroughly enough when you bought it ( or perhaps you thought you were being clever booking a trip with a way of not having to go if the Covid19 thing got worse). Why on earth did you expect them to cover cancellations etc for something that was so foreseeable ? All the insurance company is telling you is that the policy is good for everything else which might affect your holiday, but not Covid19 related stuff as that was a foreseeable event - that is perfectly normal IMO. Compare it to the case of booking a holiday when an 80 year old ailing relative was in a nursing home and being tested for cancer - if said relative then dies a week before you are due to travel , you might not want to go on holiday anymore but your travel insurance would not cover your losses for cancelling because of it - in contrast if your fit and healthy spouse was involved in a motor accident and was not going to be well enough to travel and you needed to cancel the holiday because of that , you WOULD be covered as it was not a foreseeable event"
"I'm sure I'm not alone in not taking Covid-19 very seriously even on January 20th, although I do feel very foolish about that now.I mean, I knew there was another virus in SE Asia which was starting to spread around the world, but based on other outbreaks I never for a moment though that it would affect things as seriously as it turned out.Having said that, though, I'd accept the terms of the insurance and accept that it was my own fault that I didn't take the disease seriously enough."
"So you are saying my family member that was given a few months to live, 5 years ago should not count? Think about it. Earthquakes/Hurricanes/Cancer and other things including viruses WILL happen, its predictable now beforehand. Will this sham company use this same lame excuse?"
"That's not what was said.What was said was on Jan 20th, COVID as a potential Pandemic was a well known existing condition. That's all that comes into play here."
Many other well known conditions. Cancer/Old age/Earthquakes. Why waste your money.
"If you can predict an earthquake you are in the wrong business.I feel your pain but you aren't thinking rationally about this and that is understandable. But it's the facts that matter here, not the emotions.And honestly, we only take out insurance on the grandest of our vacations. We took out insurance for our Antarctica trip and one other huge cruise about a decade ago."
"BOOKED a cruise Celebrity w/Aon travel insurance. I suffered a disabling back injury and canceled according to guidelines. Requests for medical records were ""snail mailed"" not faxed to MD's and were responded to within days of receipt. My MD's supplied me with copies of the records . Aon claimed never to have received the reports from the MD's so next I downloaded the records via Aon's website feature that enables you to download directly to their claims personnel and received an Email receipt. I also called to verify receipt.. Aon continued to claim they were not in receipt of any medical reports + they wanted a surgical report from an MD I hadn't seen in 22 years (he's been dead for 12yrs ) . Md's maintain records as required by NY law for 6 yrs- just a delaying tactic... Now after an additional 3 weeks of review their latest delay is ti demand proof of my reservation from the Cruise line who says they have no such request nor are they aware of ever having received any such requests in the past . ""your invoice is legal proof"" (Aon has 3 copies of it) FLIM FLAM ARTISTS OF THE FIRST DEGREE They'l do anything to avoid paying a claimDon't waste your money f"
