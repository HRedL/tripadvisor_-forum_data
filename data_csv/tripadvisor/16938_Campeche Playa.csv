"Happy New Year everyone.None of this looks very good for all of us investors. Turtle, I took your advice about offering to sell my apartment back to Grupo Mall for the original purchase price on the basis that they stood to make a substantial profit, if Senor Noval was to be believed in his recent article where he claimed that during November / December 08 they'd sold another 30 units at the inflated price. They did get back to me a few weeks ago and said they'd respond shortly but I haven't heard anything from them since and certainly won't hold my breath.I am just wondering what all this recent information about the pending legal action means for all of us that have invested money in the project. I took advice from my solicitor about pulling out now and was advised that although the contract states that 50% of deposits should be returned, there is no timescale for the return of the deposits. When I asked about launching an action for breach of contract after the expiration of the grace period, my solicitor felt that a further few months would have to pass - if not longer before any such action would have a chance of success. I personally feel pretty stymied and am wondering if anyone else has had similar or different advice?"
"good to see that someone has started a new forum about the project, and hopefully all the other buyers will join in. could it be that grupo mall had something to do with the last one being shut down?? there are other forums strictly relating to campeche real estate that were not shut down.one idea for the disgruntled buyers... trying to take legal action is obviously going to be a long and expensive process, probably more money in it for the lawyers than for anyone else. however, if you all start to seriously protest and complain to the state government, they might well be forced into action. this project has been constantly promoted (and partially paid for) by the campeche state government as their crowning achievement. a few public letters in the press directed at the governor and the secretary of tourism (who gave such a glowing report of support for the project eagerly distributed by grupo mall) might work better than a bunch of letters from lawyers to grupo mall. if you pull up grupo mall and the project on google, there is a long list of ""puff pieces"" published about the project... why not start getting your grievances heard in these same publications?good luck, will report next week if there is any sign of action at the project site."
"Hi everyone, I'm so glad another forum has been created. I was actively reading the old one and keeping track but hardly participated as I was feeling pretty confident of the way things were going. Not anymore. I've written to different people at INM Options over the last few weeks but have yet to hear back. And of course Robert's last report was that work on the site has stopped. I hope there's better news in your next update, Robert. I too am considering how to pull out but wonder if the best thing might also be to wait it out, esp if the alternative is legal action with expensive fees, and potentially without guarantee of 100% returns."
"hi again all.... just arrived back to the very pleasant and tranquil campeche coast this week, and took a couple of spins down past the Campeche Playa project. after scanning the horizon very carefully along all the just barely started or half finished condo buildings, i was able to spot two small groups of workers in two of the ones on the right hand (beach) side of the highway. by small i mean exactly 5-6 workers in one and 3-4 workers in the other. there was no other work going on in any of the other building sites. in fact, there was a crew dismantling a large crane that was sitting next to the relatively new building on the left (inland) side of the road, which had reached up to around 3-4 stories and which now sits like others with unprotected iron girders sticking up towards the sky. there were also a few crews here and there working on streets, perhaps some utility trenching and similar tasks. in summary, a bit of work here and there, but nothing even remotely approaching the army of worker ants that should be swarming all over this place trying to catch up. the idea that anything might be delivered in march is certainly delusional, at least as relates to march of this year! i sincerely wish there was something more positive to report, as i was hoping that the new year might at least see a reasonable amount of work being done on a few of the buildings as was happening until mid-november, and perhaps a re-start of work on the golf course which was stopped many months ago. perhaps the ICA construction group, reported to be taking over the project, is playing hardball until they can pick it up at a distress sale price. i continue to think that the campeche state government, as an active participant in the deal, will be the eventual broker who determines who ends up with what. i will continue to report back as events warrant."
Thanks Robert - not great news then I guess.I will try and get in touch with my solicitor this week to see what they have to say.
"Thanks, Robert. It's really hard for us to keep track as we're in the Far East. Any news you have always helps. "
"greetings all! i just had a last drive down the coast yesterday before heading back to Tampa for the Super Bowl. good to be able to report just a small bit of good news. the 5-6 man crew working on one of the condo buildings on the beach side of the road seems to have grown to around 20+ men this week, and they seem to be in the process of attaching the roofing structure to the building. i refer to the building just behind and on the southwest side of the two buildings adjacent to the marina area where work was going on for a few months last year. there were also still perhaps 3-4 men working on the building next to this one. on the other hand, the infrastructure work in general seems to have stopped completely, perhaps the state government budget was finally used up! it still mystifies that a project of this size should be coming into the end of january with only a handful of workers to be seen. the grupo mall has now taken to bringing in groups of prospective mexican buyers to see the project, perhaps they sense they have worn out their welcome in the european markets! in a recent press release to the Financiero newspaper, the mexican equivalent of the wall street journal, mr. noval declared that grupo mall is now going to dig up, salvage and restore 100 spanish galleons buried in the gulf of mexico, and in local press releases, they also announced a new grupo mall foundation to attend to dental and other health problems in the region. to it's great to see that apparently there is no lack of money for cultural and philanthropic missions in the area! in this same local press release, the alleged date for turning over the first condos was discreetly pushed back to a time frame between june and the end of 2009. still a long shot unless they get some serious work underway. will report back next visit sometime in february."
"I spoke with the people trying to generate mortgage applications a couple of weeks ago who were predicting that block52 (beach front) would be ready for handover somewhere near August, earliest apartments would be ready in June.My biggest problem is the force majeure clause in the contract. If they intend to apply it (and it looks like they do) it shows a real lack of integrity from the developers which makes me really nervous about many of the other claims that they have made."
So now we know....received an email saying first condos to be delivered by 30th June....ooh look a flying pig!! 
"I just got these hand over dates also and found this new forum today. So your annoying friendly turtle is back in business. LOLHere are the handover dates:R7-51 Puerta del Mar 1 30/06/09 R7-52 Puerta del Mar 2 31/07/09 R7-53 Puerta del Mar 3 31/08/09 R6-46 Marina Village 4 30/12/09 R6-49B Marina Village 8 31/10/09 R1-55 Playa Golf Village 1 30/11/09 R1-68 Maya Green Village 5 31/03/10 R6-43 Marina Village 1 28/02/10 R6-44 Marina Village 2 28/02/10 R6-45 Marina Village 3 30/12/09 R6-49A Marina Village 7 31/10/09 R2-59 Playa Golf Village 9 30/06/10 R1-58 Playa Golf Village 7 30/12/09 R2-60 Playa Golf Village 11 30/06/10 R6-48 Marina Village 6 30/06/10 R2-56 Playa Golf Village 3 30/06/10 R2-70 Maya Green Village 1 30/06/10 As an owner of building 51 (Puerta del Mar 1) my handover date is proposed as 30/06/09.Although I am happy this is now sooner rather than later, I am very concerned that some of the other buildings such as Marina Village 6 will not be completed until 1 year later (30/06/10). Do I understand correctly from this that the marina will be a building site for 1 year after my handover! This will seriously impact the ability to rent the units.I am concerned that it will not be safe or desirable for anyone to live in this phase 1 area before 30/06/10 as the marina will not be complete and I assume there will be no facilities by my handover date of 30/06/09?If this is the case then I will not accept handover on this early date and wish that handover of my unit to be ONLY when the phase 1 area is safe and completed.When will we know about the completion dates of the following:• Doctors office• Westin Hotel• Marina shops• Supermarket• Marina club• Golf club • Water, electricity and sewage systemetc."
I notice the developer put prices up 10% again last December!Still not aware of any resale market however. Might help with mortgage valuations though for more recent buyers.But still waiting to hear anything about mortgages.
I really can't believe how desperately poorly Gruppo Mall have treated their customers by keeping us in the dark. There has been no real explanation of the reasons for the delays which are now unnacceptable. As a lawyer I would find it laughable if they try to say there has been force majeure. If there has then why havent they communicated this? They cannot in my opinion turn round and plead it now(if they do) when everything has been goin so well(according to them!!)They should do the decent thing and now offer all customers a refund if they want to take it.....but of course they won't!!
"Welcome Back Turtle Beach! i'm still recovering from an extended Super Bowl party with friends here in Tampa, but will probably get back down to campeche in a week or so. in any case Turtle, i must say that your recent postings have been so realistic and logical that you have persuaded me that you are in fact just another buyer and investor! let's hope that by more participation from anyone with an interest in the project or the area, more light will be shed on what is actually happening.i was sincerely pleased to see a mild uptick in the number of people working last month, and hopefully there will be more next time around. the fundamental problem continues to be that in my humble opinion they would have to increase the activity by about tenfold to achieve anything close to the schedule you sent around, and that excludes the abandoned golf course and additional work on the marina. you have an extremely valid point that even if some condos were delivered later this summer, the area all around them will be a dusty construction site for some time to come. but i suppose that even to see them struggling along trying to put things together is better than the scenario i really thought was happening last year, that is, an abandoned project! good luck to all until next time!"
"Hi Turtle,You have mentioned that the developer put up the prices in December, any idea on the prices for beach units."
"Turtle et AllJust where are they posting the ""new"" prices I can view plenty of agents etc with details of condos but no prices.The Beach units which will be ""ready"" in June will have no rental potential until the facilities are in place ""circa 2012"" and is anybody convinced the rental guarantee will be forthcoming? I am as sceptical as ever and feel an owners collective boycot of final payments, until facilities are acceptable, should be considered.I think GM should at least acknowledge that in the current financial meltdown there will be those who will be unable to get mortgages or meet the final payment. It would surely be in their interests (GM)to offer some form of unwind, resale or get out option. No matter how much lipstick you put on the chicken its still a b####y chicken!!!! "
"If they are really providing the rental guarantees for 2 years and mortages are possible then I see no reason not to complete. However, if this is all a pack of lies or simply not possibly in the current climate then I will definately be up for a group boycott of final payment and will take them to court regarding force majeure if they claim that also. For a boycott to work we would need to get all buyers together as a group which should be possible.The only way to get list prices if to email the developer or the agents. However, GM advertised a 10% increased in mid december.I will try and get current list prices. These will be useful for mortgage applications also.Somehow I think there are problems with mortgages at present as I have not heard back from GM re my application. Has anyone else?"
"I could be wrong but I imagine GM are banking on the stagered final payments of each block to enable them to finance the build of each of the others. I doubt if they are getting many sales at present, if any at all. They are still claiming only 70% of phase 1 sold."
"I have heard that GM's other project in Panama, Los Faros de Panama is now on hold."
" Received this morning via recorded delivery a rather unintelligible missive from Proyecto Esmeralda Resort (GM) stating a transfer of rights to a guarantee trust formed by BONY/Mellon. Allegedly this will provide additional funds, although even in the available text of the missive the codicil ""with a view to increase and complement the amount of financial resources"" does not give me a great deal of comfort. I would like to know what conditions this ""Trust"" has imposed and what implicatios it has to us as buyers."
 A further scrap of information.I managed to find some quoted prices on the webb site listed below.principalinternational.co.uk/property/campec… However I think they must be marketing on Mars!!!!!!!
I had news that BBVA should be accepting those who already submitted their mortgage applications soon. I was told BBVA visited the site and workers and now working in 3 shifts and delivery is expected on time for the dates provided recently.Now we need more news of the rental guarantee.
"after conversations with my solicitor it seems that not only will they claim force majeure, but also a court in Mexico doesn't take any delay seriously if its for less than a year, whatever the contract says. So the compensation looks a right off.I asked if anyone had withdrawn and understand that someone did and got their 50% back, but it took a very long tima as GM messed them about, not returning e-mails etc.If it's true that it will be a year before the lace is habitable after handover it makes the rental guarantee attractive, but as someone has allready said, it's difficult to trust anything i'm being told at the moment. It's ridiculous that my best information is coming from this forum!"
"No surprises about the Force Majeure. I have some other off plan developments they also all claimed FM.Not sure why you would want the 50% back though, unless your circumstances have changed.Assuming the rental gauarantee is real (what we have signed so far was only a letter of intent, not a contract) then surely it is better to complete and take the rental for 2 years until the project matures and perhaps one day the globabl crisis is fixed! If there is not guarantee then I think we must all block hand over from happening early as a large group.I still think campeche is a great long term investment if it is possible to stay in."
New progress photos here:campecheplaya.com/contenidos/…
"If you go to the pictures above, translate the home page to english you will find some photos of the marina development dated 4th Feb 09 under ""WORK IN PROGRESS"" tab."
"Having probably received much the same correspondence from GM as everyone else, we have raised several points with our lawyers. As well as the obvious force majeure issue we have also raised the issue that while the dates for some appatment delivery is set out no mention is made of the golf course, the marina area, yacht club etc. It is obvious that the on going building works both within and adjacent to these areas will render them unusable until well into 2010. Our point is that on delivery of our appartment we are expected to hand over membership fees for the golf club and the marina(approx $27,000). Our initial understanding was that on completion of our apartment, while we did not expect to walk on to a pristine site, the work on what was originally designated as phase 1 would be substantially complete. "
"My biggest concern at the moment is the rental guarantee, when will the rental guarantee start from? For the marina and golf, I suppose they can say membership only starts when it is ready so you are not loosing by accepting handover. However I am worried they will do the same for the guarantees. Anyone else emailed GM etc. yet about this? I have not had any reply yet, this is usually the case when they do not know how to answer.I guess we also need to start thinking about furniture packs again soon if handover really is June 09.Also I have not heard anything from the sales agents PURE international at all for 1 year, did anyone else? "
My understanding is that there will be swimming pools for each individual building. Does anybody have clear drawings of the landscaping in front of the residential blocks especially the beach appartments.
"hi everyone.... your intrepid occasional observer is on the scene once again! just took a drive down past the project today before having a nice fish luncheon in champoton. well, there is SOME positive news to report! there is now work going on of one type or another in about six of the buildings located on the beach side and to the southwest side of what may one day be the marina. these include the two buildings where they put on a roof last fall, and where they seem to be in the initial stages of filling in the walls. next to these two, there are two more where crews are in the process of putting on the roof. and finally, just to one side of the last two mentioned, they are finally getting on with two more buildings that were started earlier, and which were just iron girders until recently. on these last two, they are just barely into getting the concrete foundations filled for the first floor and perhaps into the second floor on the other one. so, one could logically assume that someone is putting up more money to crank things up a notch or two. before Turtle Beach and others start getting all worked up again about their furniture packages and rental guarantees, may i suggest that all this excellent news does not mean in any way that they are anywhere close to actually finishing anything. if you have every put up buildings you know that once the roof and the walls are finished, the most expensive and time consuming phase of the work begins. and the idea of having anything ready to turn over in June, which is just over 90 days away, is pretty far fetched. about the recent rumor that they might be working three shifts down there, it's absolute nonsense according to local people who know those running the crews and others who have relatives working there.another mysterious point is that no one has any idea if or when the work might continue to finish the marina or the golf course, or any number of other amenities, and there is no sign of any of this happening now.i see a number of comments about the advisability of getting buyers together for some sort of legal action and the probability of success or lack thereof. i certainly agree that you need to collectively confirm your rights and to see what would be the most effective tool to enforce them. however, instead of speculating about what Mexican law may or may not say, i would suggest getting a top notch legal firm in Mexico (but NOT in campeche) to analyze one of your sales contracts and give you the real facts about how you can bring pressure on the developer to deal with you in a fair manner.once again, the scene i saw today was the most active since they stopped work for more than one year in the Fall of 2007, so let's hope the momentum can build and perhaps lead to more good things! will keep reporting as events require."
"Thank you for the update!I really hope that handover is not possible end of June 09 for the beach unit 51 as I do not want to complete yet and would prefer for work to be done on the marina, golf course, beach clubs etc.However, I suspect that they will put all efforts into completing a single building and leaving the rest of the site as an unfinished mess just so that they can get the final payments frominvestors at handover.This is the most important issue for all investors and one which should be taken up with your lawyer."
"Here are the current up to date developer prices:PM1 GFloor (3Bed) - 167,23 sqm = $ 679,138 PM1 2Floor (2Bed) - 106,88 sqm = $ 482,267PM1 3Floor (2Bed) - 106,88 sqm = $ 498,698PM2 GFloor (2Bed) - 113,04sqm = $ 472,855PM2 1Floor (2Bed) - 108,54 sqm = $ 472,411PM3 Gfloor (2Bed) - 113,04 sqm = $ 472,855PM3 3Floor (2Bed) - 105,21 sqm = $ 491,571PM4 - there is still lots of availability on each floor, prices are:GFloor - $472, 855 - $679,1381 Floor - $505,577 - $687,6482 Floor - $519,396 - $680,7843 Floor - $516,501 - $658,7844 Floor - $530,152 - $1,081,125"
TurtleWhere are theses prices being displayed? I have seen two agents offering up to 30% discount but they do not display prices The prices on int prop webb are still the same although they appear to no longer offer a facility. All very smoke & mirrorish if you ask me. If anyone wants to buy one I am a seller at significantly below these prices!!! 
"These are the current prices direct from Grupo Mall in response to an email enquiry. If purchasing now direct from Grupo Mall (not resale) this is the price you will need to pay, 30% deposit and 70% on handover, includes 10 year Jack Nicklaus Golf Club membership starting from completion of the course (with golf maintenance fees) and 5 year Yatch club membership."
"Its easy for Gruppo to advertise these prices, but are they actually achieving them ?Also, where have these units in Puerta Mar villagematerialised from? I thought all the beachfront unitsin Phase 1 had been sold.Perhaps they have been beamed to earth by Mr Spock.Anyone secured a mortgage yet?"
"There are only 7 units left in phase one beach units.PM4 was originally phase 2 but they openned sales early as there was large demand for more beach units before the global crisis hit, now they can't sell them very easily and they can not be seent to bring prices down either, in fact they raised prices 10% last December to keep with the 10% price increase every 6 months policy to encourage investors.No news on mortgages yet."
"The advice I seem to be getting from Legalex is to wait and see what happens. If the units haven't been delivered by October/November 2009 then we may have a case for breach of contract. When I look around at what is happening to property developers the world over, I think the chances we get any of our deposit back, yet alone any profit, seems highly unlikely. I would readily sell my unit at the original price. Infact I would even accept half my deposit back because I fear that in reality I have lost my deposit."
"I am still in this for the long term and see a cash return of UK £160,000 possible per unit after taxes (including original deposit possible) within 7 to 10 years. The benefit of this project over many others is the governments desire to keep it alive for the sucess of Campeche as a tourist destination."
"There aren't any short term 'outs', so there is nothing to do except wait. The test will come when the 70% final payment is due. Then we will see how many people believe in the long term profitability and pay in an extra 70%. I for one don't intend to throw any more good money after bad."
Most people will be paying the 70% with a mortgage assuming A) there is one available and B) the rental guarantee was not imaginary. Otherwise I am sure they will all cancel and the project will stop.
"LABOR DISPUTE SHUTS DOWN PROJECT. making my usual monthly trek across the peninsula after grabbing one of the many cheap flights from florida into cancun, i was curious to drive past the project twice this week to find no one working on any of the buildings anywhere again, even those that have seen positive progress going on recently. at the same time, there were groups of workers hanging around the highway in several locations. sort of looked like a work stoppage for some reason i thought at the time. yesterday and today that hunch was confirmed by both the mainstream campeche newspaper, the Tribuna, as well as the major paper in the larger city of Merida, the Diario de Yucatan. according to both reports, the workers stopped because they haven't been paid, and this basic problem escalated into a wider labor dispute with the main national labor union involved. the complaints include refusing to pay overtime, and threatening any workers who asked to be paid for overtime. in addition, the workers claim that they haven't been given proper safety gear, and in some cases were forced to purchase a safety vest and hard hat from the contractor at inflated prices. the workers further claim that less than 50% of those working at the project have been given social security and other benefits as required by labor laws. the campeche report quotes a representative from the contractor saying that they would start paying workers yesterday afternoon.hopefully this will be resolved soon, and proper work rules will be imposed for the benefit of the workers, if in fact their complaints are valid, which wouldn't be unusual for mexican construction projects. the work on several buildings near the future marina site seems to be moving along reasonably well, compared with last month's visit, although i must stress again that there is one helluva lot of work remaining before any condos will be delivered to anyone, and looking at the most recent timetable of june-july still looks pretty difficult. locals in campeche who have access to reliable information report that grupo mall is struggling just to deliver enough condos to avoid a major legal problem, and that there are ongoing negotiations to see which company will take over the rest of the deal. i'll be hanging around a few more days and will report back before heading for home once more."
"Les explico, soy de la Cd. de Campeche .. Grupo Mall tiene un contrato con ICA y esta tiene contratadas a otras empresas quienes son las que tienen problemas con los trabajadores quien en su debido derecho estan exigiendo varias cosas como pagos semanales, al igual que la devolución del dinero para un fondo que extrañamente se creo para los trabajadores, a mi parecer son los tipicos problemas que se presentan en esta clase de proyectos en México, y esta no es la primera vez que ocurre en Campeche Playa, cosas parecidas han ocurrido varias veces y siempre se resuelven los problemas con los trabajadores.Por si no lo saben en Campeche se esta en tiempos electorales y algunos diarios o personas opositoras al partido en el poder o a ciertas personas del gobierno tratan de acrecentar estos problemas, que estoy seguro pronto se resolverán.saludos!."
"Como les comente ayer, estos problemas con los trabajadores son muy comunes en este país, y ...problema resuelto.______________Se soluciona conflicto entre constructora ICA y obreros Desde Champotón, Campeche, marzo 12 (COMUNICA).- La Confederación de Trabajadores de México (CTM) desarticuló un conflicto entre obreros y la constructora Ingenieros Civiles Asociados (ICA) en el proyecto Playa Campeche en Champotón, logrando la firma del contrato colectivo de trabajo para más de 400 trabajadores, el pago inmediato de un adeudo de 300 mil pesos y la recontratación de 22 personas.El secretario general del sector obrero del Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) en la entidad, Francisco Haas Palomo, detalló que en días pasados, las obras del complejo hotelero ubicado en las playas champotoneras, se suspendieron por un problema entre los trabajadores sindicalizados y la empresa ICA.Los obreros pidieron la intervención de la CTM en la capital campechana, quienes negociación la situación a su favor, consiguiendo una serie de puntos que anteriormente prácticamente no tenían.“Aproximadamente son sindicalizados como 250 y de confianza son 150, un promedio de 400 gentes pero cuando se interviene en un contrato colectivo se ven beneficiados todos en general, lo que realmente fue lo que generó esto fue la falta de pago de parte de las personas responsables de ICA, que aparentemente no les habían pagado, entonces antier a las 5 de la tarde se les cubrió todo, ayer arrancaron labores y hoy se firmó la contratación colectiva”, comentó Haas Palomo.Así, la CTM logró el pago de 300 mil pesos, que estaban en adeudo y que al parecer ICA argumentó que no habían recibido la partida correspondiente de sus oficinas centrales.Haas Palomo afirmó que con esta firma de contrato colectivo, no solo se benefician los obreros sindicalizados sino los trabajadores de confianza.comunicacampeche.com/Php/noticiacomlocal.php…"
"Thanks lalo74, good to hear everything is now sorted out."
Turtle While my spanish is OK to get the gist of these statements I wouldnt mind an accurate translation.If youve a mind! The translation from standard methods reads somewhat gobblydegook. I have received a rental agreement document which I am requested to sign but I have had it appraised and from that perspective it doesnt appear to mean very much.Has any one else had their legal eagles look at it. 
"So we received information today that the golf course will not be ready until summer of 2010. The dredging works in the area of the beach and in the entrance canal can not be completed until November 09.The marina will be fininshed by summer but their will be no shops until the end of 09 at least, when ther should be a mini-market, restaurant and a drugstore with others to follow in 2010.The golf and yatch memberships will not start until they are ready.So all in all the place will not really be habitable on hand over of the first building in summer 2009 and they are doing so early in order to limit the cancelling of contracts (and return of deposits) when they will become in breech of contract.Therefore I will not complete on the building unless the guarantee is 100% going ahead from day 1 of handover as it will not really be rentable Summer 09 if it is handed over then."
"At long last, some correspondence from GM. Not overly impressed by the content, in fact all it does is confirms the conclusions that most of us arrived at months ago. The most obvious being that 'Phase 1' will be very much a stage by stage handover and that GM are claiming 'force majeure' for the delays. I may not be a legal eagle but surely for 'force majuere' to be invoked not only do the causes of delay have to be beyond the control of the developer but more importantly they have to have been entirely unforseen. The route of the road as far as I am aware has remained largely unchanged since day one. So that begs the question, how much planning did they put into this road crossing, what they must have known then to be, an area of 'extraordinary ecological value'. In my opinion the fault for this delay lies squarely with GM, either they were are not rigorous enough at the planning stage in exploring the possible difficulties associated with the road's construction or they were just plain incompetent.Another final disappointment with the correspondence is no mention of the hotel. Does anyone know what is happening on that front?Out of interest Turtle have you explored the options regarding holding back on acceptance of your appartment if you deem GM are in breach of contract?"
You're quite right Itchy.The first mention of force majeure....and the first mention by the developer of a problem! What a coincidence. If the Mexican Courts have anything about them they will see through the rubbish but I wouldnt like to bet on it.We're not talking about the English Legal System here!. I think if it comes to it we'll all have to stick together!
"Negotiating a path out of this situation is going to be difficult. I think most of us realise that the best we can hope for out of this mess is to get all of the money we have paid in so far paid back. Unless the money we paid is sitting in an ESCROW account, the chances of this happening seems remote. Even if we can negotiate past the Mexican courts, does the developer actually have money to pay back our deposits? I think we should investigate whether a class action or individual actions are the best way forward. If anyone has any legal knowledge their contyribution would be very helpful."
This may be a silly question but can I ask exactly why you want to get your money back? Is it because you are worried the rental guarantee will not be paid on handover and a mortgage might not be possible or because of the global recession meaning that capital gains and resale possibility have been delayed?
"Banks around the world are going from one extreme to the other. Getting a mortgage for a principal residence is hard enough, never mind a mortgage on a holiday home. What value is a rental guarantee from a company that invokes force majeure for quite predictable situations? Even if the rental guarantee is enforcable, where is the company going to find money to repay? I fear I have made an expensive mistake and lost my deposit, unless one of two things happen - Deposit money is sitting in ESCROW and the courts find in my favour OR Mexican government steps in to bail out the project for strategic developmental reasons. "
"One reason to want your money back is that it is difficult to trust anything being said or done by this company.When all was well we got a newsletter on a monthly basis, then problems and delays and silence. GM have been conpicuous by there lack of communication and even when things have been said they have turned out yo bee innaccurate.I have got more information from this forum that I have from the company that I have given thousands of dollars to.There is no feeling of security for the money spent, so why spend more?I am seriously beginning to wonder whether the best option is to take a 50% loss on what I've paid out so far."
"Hello all! great to see increased participation, and i certainly agree that as many of you as possible should stick together if you wish to enforce your rights. once again, it would make sense to spend a few euros for a brief legal analysis by a respectable mexican legal firm, but not from campeche. a couple of buyers i met some time ago sent me a copy of this letter circulated by grupo mall, and it certainly was worth a few laughs. you can start with the blatant lie that the turtle season occurs in oct-nov, when in fact it will be starting in the next 30 days and winds up around late july or early august. based on their performance to date, i would speculate that they are just trying to deliver a few units to take off the legal pressure, and that the local government will promote this effort to keep things quiet until the elections in july. how nice of mr. lalo from campeche to warn us of possible ""bias"" in news reporting on labor troubles etc.! the fact is that both papers that reported the problem, the Diario from Merida and the Tribuna from campeche, are hardly opposition publications, and the Tribuna especially has been the journalistic lapdog of this government since they took over, and it savages the opposition PAN party almost every day. so they could hardly be accused of trying to stir up trouble for the government... both articles that i cited earlier were simple reporting of facts with no embellishment at all. in any case let's hope that the labor problems have been solved, and that the workers are getting what they are legally entitled to, which isn't much in Mexico!i will be hopping back over to the Yucatan next week and will check things out and report back. i will see if some local contacts can verify if there is anything going on around the golf course or marina areas, and the much hyped hotels also.if any buyers are able to visit campeche, you should insist on being shown the site of the future golf course to verify exactly what has been done. the last buyers i spoke with were flatly denied access to that area of the project with no explanation given. until next time, keep fighting!"
Does anyone knows how to go about atleast getting half the deposit back and how long it is taking?

"You will not be able to recover your 50% until you are actually in breach of contract ie not paying the completion monies over....unless Gruppo Mall decide to accept your wish to renage on the contract and give you the 50% early. This all assumes they will be OK about it ....I can foresee that many people will be thinking twice about sending final payments to an outfit that has been less than truthful,and consequently will they be able to refund???"
"I actually advised them (GM) via my solicitor that I wanted to pull out and did not want to carry on arranging a mortgage for the final balance. My own circumstances meant that I could take the hit on the deposit but I would not be able to afford to lose the whole amount. GM immediately contacted my husband to ask us to change our mind. They told us that we could have our 50% deposit returned but that they would try and reassign our unit over the next 60 days. This was all about 3 months ago - we've heard nothing from them since and will be asking our soliicitor to chase them up again!!!In the meantime I did hear from someone via this forum that they had received 50% of their deposit back however they pulled out in July 08 and didnt get their money back until December 08 when GM finally reassigned their unit. (They did state that their unit was in a prime, seafront location).I personally would be interested in launching some sort of class action against GM - at this point, I'd be happy just to get some of my money back - I cannot see how the project can be a success in the short term and to be honest I'd be happy for them to put the whole project on hold until the world economy starts to recover."

"Some info from research today for those planning to join the Royal Rental Pool...If you are buying in building 51 the first to be handed over and are buying the furniture from Muscha Cay, you will need to see the schedule below:MUSCHA CAY SECOND DELIVERY, This is for those customers who haven't transfered the money before 15th March 2009 50% payment must be made from 16th March 09 to 31st April 09 for delivery FROM 30th August 09. Final 50% payments should be made 15th July 09.I have confirmation that the rental pool will go ahead this year from hand over as soon as you have your furniture installed and approved and your apartment has been snagged etc.Payments will be made quarterly in arrears so you will need first 3 mortgage payments ready from when your furniture is approved and you join the rental pool contract.They will provide basic services only to the first tourist with Supermarket, pharmacy and a restaurant only (obviously at a lower rate) but that does not affect the guranteed rental amounts.Assuming building 51 is handed over in July and your apartment is ready by September then your first payment from the rental pool will be around Nov/Dec time but you will need to make mortgage payments from handover."
"Am I right in thinking that the mortgage agreement is between you and the bank, rental agreement is between you and the developer. If Developer fails to meet their rental obligations, you are still liable on the mortage payments? Also, in the event you sell your unit at lower than purchase price, you are personally liable to make up the difference. In other words you can't just hand the unit over to the mortgagee and end your mortgage contract. "
"Yes that is correct. However, if you cancelled now before completion you would loose 50% of your deposit, that 50% would be enough to make mortgage payments for over 2 years by which time I am positive you could sell your unit for a substantial profit compared to the original purchase price, especially for those who bought prime beach front units in the early years. Having said that I am confident that rental guarantee will start paying income by the end of the year.I would say if you have the funds available to complete and buy the furniture pack and the credit rating/income to obtain the mortgage it is better to go ahead."
"Westin Hotel Campeche is still listed here for openiing March 2010, does anyone have any update on progress of the hotel and can confirm if it is going ahead OK ?starwoodhotels.com/westin/…look_ahead.html"
"I received a reminder from my solicitor (legal firm recommended by Pure International - who by the way have gone very quiet!) going through the protocol for completion. I enquired about cancelling my contract and claiming my deposit back. I was told that it will cost between $5-6000 to persue the claim, half payable upfront. I have enquired about joint action. Let us see what I get back. Has anyone else received anything similar from their Solicitor?"
What legal grounds are there to claim 100% of your deposit back?
"There is only a chance of a 100% refund if the Mexican Courts do not agree there is a force majeure(which it looks like GM are claiming) The solicitors recommended by Pure seem to think the Courts would agree there is a force majeure (bit of a defeatist attitude methinks)but I say again, the only thing we as customers have heard directly is that all is going along well and prices are going up all the time. If there were problems, GM should have been telling us precisely what they were. If there was a road problem,as someone else has said, this should have been flagged up at planning ,not after everyone has been lured into paying deposits.GM are solely to blame for this debacle and shoulkd if they were half-decent offer full refunds to any customer who wants one....but of course they won't. I for one am simply not prepared to give GM a further shedload of money on the basis that they might be finishing an apartment block in the middle of a building site in light of how they have dealt with this development so far. If anyone is,thn I admire your courage."
I would prefer to complete but do not want to do so until some of the basic services are available such as a pharmacy and mini market! This is not promised until end of 09 and we are being forced to complete in June 09 for building 51 which is outrageous!
"gazza, there is no chance of fighting and winning the FM claim. It looks like try and get your 50% deposit back (probably with a long wait and a battle) or complete. Surely there must be grounds to delay accepting handover however!"
"^^ I meant to say ""try and get 50% of your deposit back""."
"It is apparent to me that members of this forum and possibly the wider ownership, fall into one of two camps -those willing and able to complete on their contracts. For these people the terms of the rental guarantee are keythose unwilling or unable to complete. For us the only question is will we get 0%,50% or 100% of our deposit back and what costs are associated with getting the money back.For me this project is hopelessly behind schedule. Even if the first apartments are handed over the facilities are far from completion. I unshamedly admit that I invested in this project for short term significant gain. Through the actions of the developer and the wider credit crisis, I am forgetting about profit and concentrating on damage limitation."
"Just got the quote for my furniture pack for a 2 bed. Comes to £17,000 for a 2 bed with current exchange rate!!!"
Maybe it is possible to add to the mortgage. We should see the situation soon when the bank has done the appraisal.
Has anyone seen any photos of Block 52 as we are buying a unit in this one. (Meant to be finished July-Sept 09 depending of what you read). All the pictures in the news letters cover the same buildings every month and do not cover block 52. 
"If anyone is interested we ask Alekandra @ Inmoptions if there was going to be any other furniture packages. The response was: ""We are also looking for oher options concerning furniture, so far we have Milmundos and Coleccion Alexandra but we could have local packages too in a near future-.""Local suppliers should work out far cheaper as there would be no import/exportcharges."
"Can someone remind me, how many non beach front blocks there are meant to be in phase 1?"
"We intend to pursue a course of deferring completion/final payment until at least the end of the year. We are in block 52 (hi to all potential neighbours) so they are pushing us to complete about August. Don't know, of course, if GM will accept this position but given the alternative that they may be faced with a lot of people backing out altogether and then being chased for the return of deposits, they may see this as a worthwhile compromise. The benefit for us in trying this is that if the latest burst of progress is maintained we should have a more complete package to walk into at that time and therefore a more rentable one. (I should add that we are not going into the rental pool). Also if our proposal is accepted and GM are failing miserably at the end of the year we are no worse off in terms of opting not to complete than we would be in August. If anything we would have an even stronger case in pursuing them for delays.On the latest photos, they are a bit limited in what they show. I think some of them are definitely showing block 51 which has progressed since we last visited in November (MakeItaDouble, 52 was still at foudation stage then). I suspect they are just going to pile their resources into one block at a time.Still no word on progress on the hotel?! "
"The hotel issue is vital. If this has been put on hold for a long time or cancelled then we will not complete. We need to find out what is really going on there.ItchyFeet, why did you decide not to go with the rental guarantee?I got this info about the rental pool:Regarding to the rental guarantees, according to the contract of RRP,""RRP guarantees a minimum renting period of two years, from the time at which the three following conditions have been met:a) The committed beneficiary had granted the public deed of creation of the trust.b) He has taken possession of the apartmentc) The committed beneficiary has delivered the said apartment to RRP completely furnished. The furniture must be approved by RRP and must comply with any quality standards the company has reasonably laid down.""ps. I also think you must deleiver the furnished apartment to the rental pool within 3 months of handover."
I have now received the BBVA home loan / mortgage application form. The bank is currently doing appraisals on the value of the apartments. I guess they will also be shown the show apartment in block 51.
I notice on the website: http://www.campecheplaya.com/ they are advertising a sales office on site starting Easter 09
"Turtle Beach, not everyone needs a mortgage to finance the purchase and there is therefore less pressure to rent the apartment out, particularly through a rental guarentee scheme which only allows very limited private use.Personally, I initially purchased with a view to using the apartment for myself and family members and then selling a few years down the line. Had I chosen the rental scheme, I would now be very worried over exactly who they will be renting to whilst the resort is still under construction- the operator will be keen to recoup as much of their rental payouts as possible, maybe they'll resort to renting to locals if they can't attract the desired clientele to a building site with few facilities!!"
"I also meant to say that I can't understand why you are happy to complete with only an assurance that half the golf course and maybe the marina will be finished by the end of the year, with the rest sometime in 2010, whilst you won't complete without a definite position on the hotel. This doesn't make sense as when you complete you will be handing over the balance on the golf course and marina membership (note that Grupo Mall have only said they will run the TERM of the membership from when the course and marina are finished) with no guarentee that either will ever be completed."
"For me this is a long term investment of 10 years with 30% down. Therefore it is in my interest to complete as soon as possible and start paying off the mortgage with the rental guarantee, regardless of the state of the site.Since 9 holes of the golf course will be completed soon I am reassured that the entire golf course will proceed, especially as it has Jack Nicklaus name. However for the hotel, if construction has not even started then there is a possibility that Westin have pulled out of the deal. Therefore it is paramount that I know that status of this before I complete as I do not want to find in 2 years time when the initial rental guarantee has finished that there is no hotel there. The hotel will be required for tourism to grow in that area and also affect the resale price later when I come to sell maybe in 7 to 10 years time.My point is that there has been NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE HOTEL whereas there is information on the golf and marina etc. I am not prepared to take the risk that this development will proceed as planned eventually without further information on a key anchor of the hotel."
"Indiancamp, you seem to be the only one who realises that this project is doomed.I also fear that all money is lost.I intend to give pure international the opportunity to refund their sales commission (5%) and leave them out of litigation.As legalex are also complicit here for providing bad advice on contracts pressure should be brought on them by everyone who used them.They were highly recommended by PURE.I could continue but at this point it is only about recovering as much as possible."
"As the hotel is still on Starwood's website as a new development, I can't imagine they have pulled out (yet). I'd be more worried about the golf course- at one stage, this had a definite date of opening on the Jack Nicklaus website and now it just says ""TBD"" ie to be determined."
We are thinking of going into the rental pool as well but also wanted more time for ourselves. We have asked for 3 weeks at a time and have been advised that this is ok with the same rates of deduction being applied as indicated for the other two weeks depending on the time of year.It would seem from this that additional weeks are not a problem as long as plenty of notice is given.
Tt-7I derive no pleasure in worrring about the demise of this project. These types of projects are funded by apartment sales. I don't imagine that the developer is anywhere near their sales target and therefore I think their funding situation will be terrible. I agree entirely with your comments on Pure and Legalex. Legalex have actually sent me an invoice asking for the remaining 50% of their fees and quoted 5-6000 USD in order to negotiate a cancellation of the contract. They go on to say that in their opinion it will be difficult to cancel the contract. At this stage I can't decide whether to cut my losses entirely and write back to Legalex saying no more money will be forthcoming or to take a chance and pay them $6000 in the hope of recovering atleast half my deposit.
"Indian Camp....I received the same info from Legalex but understood the 5-6000 was only requested if you wanted to pursue an action NOW to get the whole of your money back and fight the Force Majeure issue...not for the 50%,which you should(?) be able to get back once YOU are in breach of contract (which presumably you are not yet until you fail to pay the final completion monies)"
"gazzaleedsI don't have the email from Legalex here in front of me right now. What I recall is that they asked for the 50% of the initial fees to be paid now and 50% of the $6,000 for negotiating the contract cancellation, to be paid upfront."
"Hi IndiancampJust read the email again. We are entitled to 50% of the deposits back IF AND WHEN we are in breach of contract (when we do not pay the completion monies as per the contract). If you want to argue either that GM are in breach NOW or you want to get your 50% NOW then you may have to go to court, and the fees quoted are for that scenario.That is my interpretation (as a semi-retired Solicitor!)"
"Thx gazzaleeds,Are you still intending to complete? What do you think the chances of recovering the full deposit are?"
"No I'm not going to complete. My personal circumstances have changed as well as the exchange rate and the economy, and this together with the delays, and the way the whole thing has been handled means I'm not prepared to take the risk, but I still expect to get at least 50% back unless GM go to the wall, but hopefully they won't."
^^ Maybe you should let them know so that they can try and sell now so that it won't mess everything up for the rest of us who want to complete.
"I am speaking to my Solicitor about that thanks but I'm sure that GM read the forum anyway,don't you Turtle?...."
"GM the developer, lending Banks, Local Government and the buyers in phase 1 should sit down and discuss a way out of this. Future phase sales aren't going to fund this project. GM will need to scale back thier plans, the Banks will have to write off a big chunk of their inestment and GM will need to come back with a scaled back proposal to buyers which has credibility. The sort of proposal that would work for me would involve a renegotiation of purchase price. I would consider investing a bit more money if GM come with a more realistic development plan and reduce the price of the aprtments to reflect the new eonomic reality. The issue of GM's credibility also needs to be addressed."
"I think it is reasonable to assume that Phase 1, the golf course, the hotel, the marina and shops could all be completed OK by end of 2010 if existing buyers complete as intended or returned units are resold at a small profit above original purchase price within a reasonable time frame. Probably why the new on-site sales office will be up and running very soon.The problem will be in selling phase 2 and later phases and that depends on the global economy as in all other developments. By stretching out phase 1 until 2011 I assume they are hoping things will recover by then and phase 2 can go on and sell well especially if phase 1 is fully completed with Jack Nick golf course, Westin hotel, beach clubs etc. It will be a very luxurious resort and eaier to sell and will be a real product then.I still have faith that all can be completed as planned (only delayed) and will be a very good investment over a 10 year period as all property investments should be considered (especially if taking a mortgage). Speculation is for gamblers and in this case speculators who could not afford to complete in the first place will make a loss due to the global economy."
"Very sanctimonious of you Turtle. Out of a hundred buyers i'd be surprised to find more than a few who invested in this project for altruistic reasons or to go and live in Mexico. A property purchase other than a family home for you own use is a gamble on the increase in value. Waiting for 10 years to make your money back is as much of a gamble as the wild 'speculators' that you admonish in your message.I'm not trying to elicit sympathy from anyone. I realise I made what I thought was a correct investment at the time. Things have changed and we'll wait and see if I recover 0%,50% or 100%. A constructive dialogue with all the involved parties is something I am open to. Blind faith in GM and their spin is of no interest to me. Call me a speculator if you like, but it is speculators like me that you'll be relying on in the future to make your profit in ten years. "
"I agree with both indiancamp and gazzaleeds. As things stand now i have no intention of completing because i really have no idea what i'm getting. If it wasn't for this forum i would have no idea what is going on. how GM can expect you can give tens of thousands to a company who don't tell you what's happening, but then still expect you to hand over hundreds of thousands when they decide it's right for them is beyond me.Legalex and Pure are both saying ""wait and see"" rather than taking any positive action. It amazes me that someone has a price from legalex to try and release them from the contract on an individual basis. As solicitors representing a large number of purchasers you would imagine that they would be in touch offering options as they are more than aware of the growing satisfaction with the development. After I raised my own query about pulling out they sent me a completion document within a week!I really wonder whether it is time to look for alternative representation for us as a group of dissatisfied and sceptical buyers. If anyone has any worthwhile contacts then let me know.I am really not prepared to give this lot any more of my money."
"First thing that needs to happen is that GM realise that the project is in trouble. Secondly, the solution has to involve the Banks lending to GM. If the company that owes the money to the Banks files for chapter 11, the legal title for the land will probably revert to the Banks. So, the solution has to be one where the Banks are incentivised not to force the company into chapter 11.Let us say that the average cost of purchase for a 2 bed was 250k at launch. Let us now say that the market has fallen 50% , so the apartments are worth a notional $125k. Each buyer has so far paid $75k. Would more buyers be willing to complete if they had to pay in a further $50k instead of $175k? Who bears the loss? The Banks would bear it if that is more than they would recover in the event of a chapter 11. The Buyers would still need convincing that the extra $50k is worth investing but if the developer came clean about difficulties, put in place a remediation plan and down sized the ambitions then perhaps enough people could be persuaded. I think very few people buy into the spin of notional price rises and promises of completion."
"Good points raised by indiancamp. I fully agree that if GM want to keep this project going they should now be pulling their head out of the sand and entering into some serious constructive dialogue with all concerned. They must now be aware through this forum and from feedback from lawyers that there are more than a few people considering pulling out. Rather than trotting out their bland pronouncements on price increases, delivery dates etc, they should be acknowledging and meeting the concerns raised by everyone, head on. To say, as they do, in their latest release that they have reached agreement to complete what they regard as the essential elements (i.e. the appartments of phase 1) is to completely miss the point that for most investors the essential element is phase 1 complete, including the hotel.As I have said in my previous post we are trying to pursue a course of deferring completion on our apartment at this time. This for us would mean no completion until marina and golf course were complete and the hotel well on the way to completion, whilst it is a 'wait and see' policy it is in no way a bluff and we would not complete if it didn't seem likely that these conditions were going to be met within the next 6 months."
"It will very interesting to see what valuations BBVA come back when they have completed the appraisals shortly. Then we can see the value that the bank is willing to lend on.Assuming the bank does value at higher than the original purchase price then the following figures give some indication as to why I think it may still be good to proceed to completion (quick calculations here):Purchase price = USD $350,000 30% deposit paid = USD $105,000Furniture pack = USD $25,000Total mortgage required (finc. furniture over 20 years) = USD $270,000Monthly mortgage repayment at average of 6% = USD $1961 / Currently EUROs 1,476Guaranteed rental income USD $19,200 per annumAmount owing after 10 years mortgage payments = $200,000 (guess work here need to calculate)Conservative estimated sale price in 2019 = $700,000 (hopefully a lot more though??)Income = $700,000 - $200,000 - $43,320 (additonal mortgage payments) = USD $456,680 + any additional rental income above the rental guarantee over remaining 8 years.(not including any renewal fees for golf / marina, service and maintenance charges)"
"Try this calculation - Purchase price $250kless deposit $75kNet $ $175kadd: furniture $200k = Mortgage required.Plus arrangement fees, legal fees, Mortgage indemnity fee?Annual mortgage cost 6% ( i doubt as low as this but lets go with it) = $12,000 p.aat 7% cost = $14000 p.aat 8% cost = $16000 p.aAnnual rental (5% of 250k) = $12,500 p.a and remember this 'guarantee' is from the same people who said delivery in 2008 and are delaying phase 2 to 2010/11 'in the hope the economy recovers'Not including any other maintenance costs or furniture replacements costs etc.Price in 10 years = PURE SPECULATION"
"Agreed that no one knows what the price will be in 10 years, it could be $2 million it could be 0. But this holds true for all property anywhere in the world, so as a property investor which you are, you must have some faith in property long term even if we are in a recession now.In 10 years time I can imgaine that the entire resort is completed and well established. Wealthy US citizens may then want to purchase this golf home on the sea front as a second home or retirment home. In 10 years there should be a good exit stratergy but your 2/3 year plan is true speculation that the market would continue to boom and you sell at the top."
"One more thing : IF BBVA are the main lenders to Projecto Esmeralda, please be very careful with their valuation. It is in their interest to value the properties at a high price. Reason is that, they are substituting the borrower's risk for their Projecto Esmeralda risk. In the event that you decide to or have to sell the unit, any shortfall between mortage and disposal proceeds will have to be made up by the borrower. I am not a lawyer so I don't know what recourse BBVA would have to your other assets but consult a solicitor (may I suggest not Legalex!)"
"Hi to all,I have followed this thread for some time and I am very happy that this new forum has started.I am buying in 51. I have no intention of completing until the apartment can gain income. Rental guarantees are worth nothing as the usual scam is to set them up in a subsidiary company which can then be folded if the cash runs out. Also to get into this scheme you need to pay for a ridiculously over-priced package of furniture, which will be trashed before you can use the place. Why on earth would anyone want to do that!I have asked the developers for the interest owed. Not in any expectation of getting it but to start to develop the pattern of bad faith by GM.I agree with the posters, above, that the claim of FM when it is simply their incompetence takes the biscuit.Legalex have been hopeless, in my view. They have asked for their remaining 50% fee just to write to GM and do their job - I think they see which way this is going. Interestingly they also said that everyone was doing different things so there couldn't be a class-action to cover the final court fight about breach of contract, or any division of costs even at this stage. This site shows they are talking BS and are charging $750 to send out the same printed letter several times.I suggest that those of us who are not intending to complete start gathering together to that Legalex know that they have to deal with us properly. I can be emailed through this site and I am happy to co-ordinate a list of people so, if someone pulls this site again we can still co-ordinate our legal response when the final demand for completion is made.Thank you all for your input over the last couple of years.David"
"Hi Everyone, I too share David's sentiments. While I have no intention of selling back at the moment as I believe there will be gains to be made in a few years, I don't want it completed and my hand forced to pay up when it's hardly uninhabitable.I rec'd a mail from Pure yesterday detailing a site inspection done by one of the directors. Has anyone rec'd this too? One of the last few comments made in the mail was this: ""I understand Legalex have been contacting all their clients (and by virtue of this nearly all PURE’s buyers) and as they intend to travel to Campeche in the very near future to negotiate with the Developer and I would urge you to respond to them immediately so that they can form the basis of that negotiation from a legal standpoint.""I haven't heard from Legalex at all! And honestly, I don't know what to make of the situation anymore. Do us buyers go it alone with another law firm? Or do we band together to confront Legalex? "
"hi everyone! great to see the growing participation and comments! i just came back down for a few days in spite of the rather warm temperatures, and of course took a ride down the coast past the project. there is certainly a decent amount of work going on where several of the beach side condo buildings are underway. delivering any of them in the next 90 days will be a stretch, but at this point there are certainly more workers on site in the actual buildings than i have seen before. a couple of buyers whom i have met down here sent me copies of the letter sent out by Pure, and their assessment of what is going on seems to be entirely accurate from what i see firsthand and what i am told here. there are quite a few knowledgeable people around here who believe that the ICA construction company will actually end up taking over the project, and that they may be doing the work in exchange for same. you have to ask yourself where grupo mall came up with the funds to suddenly crank up the work after more than one year of total inactivity, and with the buildings started by the original contractor, Acciona, completely abandoned. considering the current financial and market conditions, it's a safe bet that they haven't suddenly enjoyed a spurt of new sales!! suggestions by the previous two writers about organizing amongst the buyers are excellent and i have made the same comment for quite a while. i would hope that the legal firm mentioned by Pure would not overcharge and would do a top notch job of defending all your rights. after all the other frustrations you have been through, to get overcharged to protect yourselves would really be over the limit. i would suggest that you all ask the legal firm to commit firmly in writing as to what the maximum fee they expect from each buyer would be, and what they guarantee to do in exchange for it. as a sales organization, Pure is certainly in the middle of this and has moral and legal obligation to make sure that the legal team defends your interests.one additional positive point i can add is that i personally saw the electric line being brought down to the project from champoton this week... they have put up the concrete posts and three thick cables for about 4 kms so far, so that is now happening. should be no surprise but in this project any actual delivering on promises warrants attention.i am pleased to see more of you taking part in this forum, especially since when i started making questioning comments some time ago as a casual local observer, it was just to provoke more of you into visiting or at least demanding accurate information. well done all!"
"After reading pure's assessment of the current state of the project, especially the state of the common areas and golf course, I have also decided to pursue delay of handover through legalex as I am worried that the project will not be rentable and as mentioned that the guarantee can be stopped at any time should they fail to make any income from the rental pool. Regarding legalex fees, 50% of the remaining to be paid to start this negotioation on an individual basis is acceptable to me as the remaining has to be paid in full in any case at some point in time."
"I would try to hold legalex and pure responsible as much as Grupo mall.Pure recommended legalex knowing full well that they were going to protect pures' and Grupo malls interests, otherwise they would earn no money.They are completely corrupt in my opinion and legalex especially should be held to a higher standard.They have done nothing to protect my interests after me emphasing how important it was for the contract to be assignable.I would attempt to render the contract void because of the multiple conflict of interests here.I don't believe the development will be completed for a few years the way it was sold to us."
We did not buy through Pure so have not seen their report. I would be grateful if someone could email be a copy.
"PROPERTY• The construction company ICA (www.ica.com.mx ) has a good reputation for quality and timely delivery – the Developer advised me that the timelines put forward for closing are those that ICA have contracted to so they maintain they are confident about them being achieved. • I am advised that upwards of 800 personnel are on the site daily. There is without doubt a good level of on-site personnel; however I did not count them.• A show apartment is being fitted out in Marina block A and also Beachfront Block 51. The most advanced of these was the Marina one that was 75% complete with flooring, tiling, kitchen, bathrooms largely completed. The balcony also had the hot tub installed. The standard of finish was good and did not disappoint.• There was evidence on site of a lot of the bathroom furniture, porcelano tiles etc being stored for forthcoming fitting/installation. • All construction appears to have been halted on the Golf units.• Construction is being focussed on the Beachfront units( 3 blocks) and this will be followed by the Marina buildings A & B (the 2 nearest the mouth of the Marina/beachfront)• It is planned that they will deliver Block 51 Beachfront first (July 2009) followed by Block 52 (August/Sept) and Block 53 (October/November). In my opinion these timelines are optimistic despite my comments about ICA above. Indeed, Block 53 was only a shell with only 1 storey of concrete having been poured. The block is supposed to be 4 storeys.• Certainly most construction personnel on site were at Blocks 51 and 52 and these are the most advanced blocks on the project. Plumbing and power supply were evidenced in bothSITE• The Federal highway currently still runs through the resort• The ""new"" federal highway I am told should be finished and open by September 2009 at the latest- there was no reason for me to doubt this as you could easily see the re-routing and the construction that had already occurred.• The water purification plant is all but finished as is the water recycling plant• I am advised that the fibre optics are laid (internet connectivity etc)• The Drainage, sewerage, power and water grids I am told are all installed.• Electricity pylons still run across the resort, these are to be moved in June 2009.• There are no communal areas that are identifiable such as pathways, gardens and car parking.• There were no pedestrian paths that were identifiable.• There was no street lighting that was evidenced.AMENITIES• There was no evidence of any work being done on the golf course. Indeed, 9 of the golf holes are sited on land that still carries the federal highway and accommodates the electricity pylons so nothing meaningful has happened on these holes. For the remaining 9 holes there was some evidence that some site clearance and shaping of the holes had occurred but this was very limited and hardly at an advanced stage. Obviously as a result of this there was no grassing/seeding of fairways, sculpturing of bunkers, construction of tee boxes or laying of greens and the associated manicuring. It seems highly unlikely that any of the golf holes will be open for usage within 12 months. • Construction of the golf clubhouse had not commenced.• There is still dredging to be done at the Marina.• Evidence of the support walls for the marina (huge iron casts) were there laying alongside the marina itself ready for installation.• No construction is happening at the site of the Westin Hotel. I am told the foundation platform is in but nothing is coming out the ground yet"
"Turtlebeach,If you pay legalex the remaining 50% that doesn't mean you won't have to pay them any more when it come time to complete, read what they have sent you. The 50% is just to write and give the developers your position (or at least the same email to me said that). Legalex just want their money and I have seen nothing from them that makes me believe they are acting in my best interest. When I specifically asked Legalex to group some of the clients together so we could minimise our costs they told me that each of their clients had taken a different stance stance with GM, that is patent rubbish. When I questioned what I would get for my $750 they were very vague - I would never deal with a UK solicitor with such an open wallet.If we act individually then Legalex will charge each of us individually, if we act together we should minimise our costs and show both our solicitors and the developers that they have to take us seriously. You will be far worse off (as will the rest of us) by working alone. Anyone who has Legalex as their solicitor and is looking to postpone completion until the site is viable +/_ wants to consider filing (at some point, not yet) for breach of contract then please contact me through this site. Anyone not with Legalex feel free to contact me so you know what action we are taking so you can do the same.Davidps anyone know what is happening about the dry marina behind block 51 (interesting as when I called it a workshop to Legalex, they called it a dry dock when they wrote back so clearly knew about it)."
"I paid legalex 50% of their fee when I signed the contract, 25% now to negotiate delay of handover and will pay another 25% on actual handover. This is my understanding."
"Turtle, many thanks for the update."
"Turtle,I believe the Legalex fee you mentioned of 25% to delay and a further 25% to complete is correct.I certainly see merit in a joint action, minimising legal costs for those who wish to wait for the marina and golf club to be finished. I know the hotel is outwith the contract but we were always told from the beginning there would be a hotel and it is extremely important to the attractiveness of the development.( As is the Health Clinic to Seniors)It would be helpful for everyone wishing to go down this route of delaying until amenities are finished to discuss it with Legalex.The important thing is that our action is recorded before the handover date lapses and we are not then putting ourselves in breach of contract.I have looked back over some old emails from February past from Inmoptions when enquiring about the current selling prices of the next phase due in 2010 on behalf of a friend. I was told that the beach front 3 bedroom appartments are currently (February 09) selling for;area space 127-223 sqm between 679.000 and 1.081 000 USD It will be interesting to see what the BBVA valuations come in at.Regards to allMrs Itchyfeet"
Has anyone actually heard direct from Legalex re their forthcoming visit to Campeche?
"Legalex contacted me recently stating that I had three options:1. To complete fully on handover.2. To partially complete until the golfcourse and marina are built.3. To not complete and pursue an action against GM in order to recover my deposit - they stated that this would cost around $4 - 6,000.I hope that this helps. It seems from the content of this forum that the project is in real difficulties - what I would like personally is a bit of honesty from GM / Pure Intl on the exact status of our investments."
"legalex gave me 4 options!1) if you wish to complete now on the apartment as long as the developer is willing to give you a compensation for delays in addition to the delayed payment and completion of the membership contracts 2) if you wish to cancel the contract and request the refund from the developer 3) if you are only willing to complete on the apartment when the marina, the golf course and commercial areas are completed. 4) or if you would be prepared to complete now on the apartment as long as you receive income from the rental pool as from the hand over of the unit, and at a later date on the marina and golf course as the developer is proposing.I instructed them on 3) as they said they can forefully negotiate on this or point 1)"
"Regarding the state of the project, my own hunch is that they are not getting many (if any) sales at the moement due to the global crisis. I am concerned then that they might be dependent on income from handing over the properties and that is the reason they are currently staggering handover and putting all effort into building 51 and 52 at present to get them done and paid for. By delaying handover the project may be put in jeopardy. However on the other hand I am not willing to take the risk that I will be left with a single building and the rest going to rack and ruin with no golf course, hotel etc."
legalex are travelling to campeche at the end of May to negotiate with the Directors of Playa Esmeralda ( Grupo Mall). They are waiting for a feedback from all clients as to the exact actions that they want them to undertake.
"This isn't schadenfreude because I am in the same boat, but it is good to see a sense of reality manifest itself on this forum. Legalex gave me three choices as mentined in a previous post. The cost of negotiating a contract termination was put at 4000-6000 with 50% payable upfront. No probability of success was given nor a time frame. Are there many willing to trust Legalex with another 4000-6000? I know neither the developer nor Legalex can be blamed for the credit crisis, but did Legalex really ensure that our deposit payments were being made only after ensuring that contractual obligations were being met?That is all water under the bridge. I have said this before, unless our deposit money is sitting in ESCROW, the Developer will not have any funds to pay us back anything. All future building will be dependent on future sales which must be really struggling. The three parties involved in this have to get together and discuss a way out of it. The three parties are lending Banks, the borrower(developer) and us the purchasers. A slimmed down project with a realistic build timeline and ambitions, a project manager with a good track record in Mexico and a amicable way of sharing the pain might persuade enough people to put in some more money to see this project through. Without this, I fear the deposit is gone and I pray that the counterparty with whom we signed th initial contract does not have recourse to our personal assets to force us to complete.I would welcome comment on this last point from someone with legal knowledge. "
"Is the 4k to 6k the legal cost of recovering the return of the whole deposit through the court, rather than just accepting a 50% loss on the deposit?Has anyone instructed Legalex to negotiate the cancellation of their contract, with the return of just 50%, when they go out there in May?"
The way I read their letter is that they want the remaining 50% of the legal fees agreed at time of signing contract paid before they'll do anything. The 4000-6000 estimate is for ending the contract and claiming the full deposit back. 
Indian camp.....noone can force you to complete or have recourse to your personal assets.
"Thanks to those who have replied, I hope that we don't need to do more than we have.I have confirmed with Legalex that the payment is as described by Turtle. TBH though the clarification came from Pure. Basically Legalex are doing part of the final conveyencing now, so some of the fees have been moved forward too, which I am happy with.Pure have confirmed several points which reassure _a little_.GM are looking to get some cash flow from the early apartments. There is mounting pressure all round to stop them pushing us to complete, as many now acknowledge that that will not get them money now but will force the hand of investors to either pull out completely (with GM paying back 50% of the deposit) or suing for Breach of Contract.I things will become clearer once GM get the message that people aren't going to complete."
"I have been informed by Legalex that to be able to postpone the completion, it will be necessary for me to sign the rental agreement and forward it to GM.Has anyone else been told the same?"
I haven't been told by Legalex that in order to postpone the completion the Rental agreement must be signed. This doesn't make much sense either.
"Has anybody that is interested in getting their deposit back tried, no win, no fee deal with Legalex?Don't know if Spanish/Mexican law allows this."
"I guess signing a letter of intent that you are going to join the rental pool demonstrates that you intending to complete on the unit a some stage rather than request a refund or go to court. So doing so may give legalex more to bargain with GM to delaying the handover. Not sure, just a guess."
 Legalex informed me that the rental agreement letter that was sent as an annexe to the contract would need to be returned to the developer.Legalex have also informed me that the deposit has been lodged in an escrow account.Has anybody decided to give Legalex 50% of the outstanding fees to negotiate delaying the completion?
Yes I have paid legalex 50% of remaining fee already.
Bloody hell........a flu epidemic now. Its doomed!!
The flu will be long forgotten by the time the golf course is ready! But may affect/delay legalex's plans to visit Grupo Mall in May.
Has anybody applied for a mortgage yet? If so any news yet.
"I know it's pretty much all gloomy stuff out there. But did anyone see some pictures that were sent recently by Pure? The place is absolutely beautiful. It's such a shame. No one can predict on the economy but if it all hadn't gone south, we wouldn't all be in here wringing our hands. Oh well...I'm still holding on and would like to push back completion. I hope there's a big enough community of us making that demand so Campeche will stay happen."
New story in spanish. Claiming construction 80% complete for phase 1 and handover still on target for mid June 2009.…imageshack.us/img218/6417/dibujodrp.png
"I rec'd another mail from Pure last week. A few areas were covered:1) Progress on site - supposed to be going well but awaiting Legalex's assessment. Their trip, however, has been postponed till June due to swine flu.2) Mortgage negotiation with BBVA for US$ mortgage deal. 3) Furniture package - not a main priority at the moment but Pure has requested for furniture inventory.I'd like to believe it's a good thing Pure is stepping up communication to buyers at this point.

"Dear All,As a fellow prospective purchaser new to this Forum I have the following brief comments to make:I will not be completing my purchases at Campeche Playa Resort come hell or high water.Grupo Mall have acted entirely without good faith throughout my dealings with them.Legalex have right from the start demonstated a quite unforgivable level of greed and have been charging individual clients for work they (for the most part) only needed to carry out once. I say this as a Lawyer myself. They will not be interested in organisating a class action as they prefer to deal with everyone separately and carry on collecting multiple fees.As a lawyer specialising in civil litigation for the last 15 years who has both run and defended such arguments, I can tell you that Grupo Mall's force majeure argument is a total sham and is completely hopeless, at least before a sensible and sane Court that has not been bribed.I can't speak for anyone else's particular circumstances, but I believe very firmly that the inordinate delays that have occurred entitle me to elect to rescind the purchase contracts and to a return in full of the instalments paid to date, as well as interest thereon (and damages for loss of opportunity).Grupo Mall have lied to me and deceived me for several years over a number of matters. I have written to them patiently a number of times but they are totally incapable of a sensible, pragmatic dialogue. They repeatedly urge in their communications that they should be trusted. They do not deserve to be and they are not, and for good reason.I have confirmed my election to rescind my purchase contracts and if I do not receive all my instalments back plus interest and damages I will initiate legal proceedings that Grupo Mall will not successfully defend.My respectful suggestion to fellow prospective purchasers is to do likewise, and I would be happy to explain why in more detail if anyone wishes to reply to me individually.I will be issuing legal proceedings individually unless others wish to join me in a class action.I am not the sort of person who would normally get involved in co-ordinating positions as between individuals. But Grupo Mall's conduct has been so arrogant, so dishonest, so ignorant for so long that it thoroughly deserves that is coming its way. Peter. "
"Hi Peter, I am delighted to hear someone who shares my opinion.I would be happy to join you in litigation.Let me know if I shuld email you or telephone you. "
"I am also pulling out and have asked Legalex to ask for a full return of my deposit and, if this fails, I would be more than happy to join a class action against Grupo Mall. Is there any possibility that litigation could take place thro the Spanish courts as opposed to the Mexican courts, as GM is a Spanish company?"
"I am sticking with delaying accepting handover until the golf and marina are ready as per the contract. If this is possible I am happy to stay with this potentially stunning, high class development.If legalex are unable to negotiate this then I will instruct a different lawyer to get a full refund."
"Peter, I also intend to pull out of the Campeche Playa project and would like to sign up to your litigation group"
"What cost have Legalex quoted you in order to negotiate a full return of deposit? I recall a figure of close to $4-5000, with no guarantee of success. I'd be willing to enter into some king of no win no fee deal with them but not sure I want to pay them any more right now."
"PeterI am in agreement with your comments and I am certainly interested in discussing this further with you. Please let me know the best way to communicate with you, either by e-mail or telephone"
Peter I too would like to join your group - please email me. I tried to pull out earlier on this year but have heard absolutely nothing from either Grupo Mall or Legalex.
The only thing I'v eheard from Legalex is an email asking for money. They want me to pay the 50% of fees relating to completion. I own in block 55 which must be months and months away from completion. I'd love to hear from people who have got 50% or 100% of their deposit back. I'd like to know how long it took.
"Hi Peter,I would also like to join this group.Could you give me your contact details."
Interesting that all reference to Campeche Playa has been removed from Pure International's website
"There was an interesting email today from Pure.Besides the issue of delaying completion, one of the more alarming issues was that Pure confirmed that mortgages of only 70% of the total purchase price EXCLUDING the golf and marina costs will be available. So although we already paid 30% of the total price, I take it that means the remaining 70% can not be offered as a mortgage in full and additional cash must be invested?!It also seems very unlikely BBVA will offer to add the furniture pack to the mortgage. Mortgages will also only be available in Euros not USD!"
PeterIf you are happy to take up the cause I am more than happy to participate. The more the better and stronger as far as I can see.Can you advise me of the required details?RegardsPhilJ66
"hi everyone! i haven't added my two cents worth of wisdom lately because i have been quite busy on the golf course in florida, and also because it has been very good to see so many buyers waking up and smelling the coffee and getting into the communication loop. great to see you all standing up on your hind legs and fighting for your rights. during a quick recent visit to the campeche coast, the activity in the area of the condo towers continues to be impressive... 2-3 of the buildings have tile roofs and the exteriors painted, and the others are coming along nicely in that area. the flip side of all this good work is that, according to informed local sources, and apparently confirmed by recent comments above, the developer has no financial ability to complete the golf course, marina and other promised amenities. the apparent goal is to turn over enough units to avoid a large legal problem and scandal for the developer and the state government. other reports indicate that the ICA construction company that is doing all the ongoing work is slowly acquiring control over the project.... not a bad thing perhaps because this is a top notch outfit and the largest of its kind in mexico. in summary, at least the project is gradually growing to a large enough size that someone will come in and finish it at some point, but how and under what conditions need to be clarified for those contemplating sending in addition money.keep communicating and organizing! "
"Mall are now putting the pressure on buyers to complete by stating that unless they receive the full mortgage application by tomorrow they will assume that we have decided to manage everything on our own, and they would then only contact us in the future to arrange the date and time for the delivery and deed procedures. I assume then that Mall will completely ignore Legalex's request to delay completion and we will be forced to complete or apply for a 50% refund which I imagine will take 6 months or more to take place.Legalex have stated that they have found out that the whole project has been divided into 120 separate plots of land.Pure have stated the maximum loan to value mortgage that BBVA Bancomer are prepared to advance to our buyers is 70% of the agreed purchase price OR valuation whichever is the lower. The purchase price does not include the Golf and Marina. Pure agreed to double check on this but have not come back with any more information.In regard to a mortgage (if required) my recommendation would be to put the framework in place that would enable completion to happen (whenever this is) and provided you could achieve this without incurring any arrangement fees then by all means go ahead. Pure are advising, ""In regard to a mortgage my recommendation would be to put the framework in place that would enable completion to happen (whenever this is) and provided you could achieve this without incurring any arrangement fees then by all means go ahead.""Robert's comments about ""according to informed local sources, and apparently confirmed by recent comments above, the developer has no financial ability to complete the golf course, marina and other promised amenities"" are very worrying. I would like to know more Robert about your sources and if they are genuine or political scare mongering?"
"A mi igual me gustaría saber cuales son las fuentes de Robert, en Campeche estamos en tiempos electorales y se puede decir cualquier cosa. Los diarios y las televisoras del partido contrario al que esta en el poder dicen cualquier cosa, también hay diarios y televisoras que estan a favor del partido en el poder pero no a favor de ciertos grupos dentro de este partido; por ejemplo, el diario ""Tribuna"" criticó muchas veces la construcción del complejo para afectar la futura candidatura del Secretario de Turismo, que al final no quedó como candidato, se los digo para aclarar ciertas cosas.Y regresando a Campeche Playa:El día 26 de este mes Don Julio Noval dio una pequeña conferencia de prensa, salieron varias notas en los diarios locales, les pongo una del diario ""Novedades"":http://i40.tinypic.com/2u4ttoy.jpgtambién aparecieron posters de los avances del complejo en páginas completas de varios diarios haciendo referencia a la próxima entrega de 300 viviendas.Un saludo desde Campeche!."
"I have just received an email from Legalex, informing me that unless I pay them the addtional fees within 7 days, they will no longer represent me. My understandng is that they want me to pay the remaining 50% of legal fees that were due on completion, now rather than at completion. In echange they will negotiate with Grupo mall to either:- cancel the contract and pay back 50% deposit- delay completion- fight Grupo Mall's force majeur claim and get back the ful deposit.Has anyone received such an email? Have many people paid? If I don't pay Legalex is their any other class action I can join?"
"hi gang... just a quick note before heading out for the rest of the week. how kind and considerate of ""mr. lalo"" to be concerned that i might be relying on opposition newspapers for information on the project during an election period. allow me to put his mind at ease, since while the best source of information and impressions can be gained by a few ounces of common sense as one watches this project evolve in a rather strange way, other tidbits of information have come to me simply by accident while hanging around campeche, from people who have close relatives working at the project, suppliers who are owed money and complain they never get paid, etc. however, let's put the shoe on the other foot. perhaps mr. lalo could convince the developer to come across with some of the following....1. actual photos of what is taking place at the site of the future golf course NOW, since they are now promising to have it open by the end of the year. buyers visiting recently have been refused access to the area where the golf course is supposed to be. 2. proof that the developer has received approval from the city and the state for transferring titles to condos legally within a recognized condominium community. this is a very complex and time consuming process in mexico, and to my knowledge one has never been submitted or approved in the state of campeche. so if they are intending to deliver 350 condos before the end of this month, as their full page ad stated last sunday, they should have already completed this process.3. proof that the city of champoton has received all property tax payments for said condo units, and has issued certificates for each one accordingly.i could add a few more items to the list, but let's not hope for too much. as i've said several times before, i purchased a small ranch in the same general area as the project, i play golf and hoped to enjoy the course in the future as well as shopping, dining etc., so i have absolutely nothing to gain if there are problems with the project.... i truly hope it takes off and gets 100% completed. but i just don't like playing fast and loose with facts and promises, as has happened all to often to date.hope all the rest of you gringos have a great july 4th weekend as i intend to!"

I may try and complete on the unit with a mortgage and then sell later. Think the chances of getting 100% money back this way are better and maybe faster.
Since the golf and marina will not be ready there should be no need to pay these parts until they are ready. So you can get 70% mortgage on the rest. Will look with interest to legalex report however on the current status.
"Hi All, Thought some of you who are unsure of what to do next and are basing your decision on the developers promises might like to know what can actually happen when they don't follow through. Below I've condensed what happened at another resort development marketed by Pure, Solara Resort, Canmore, Canada. 2004 Pure market Solara as a 4 season luxury resort. Get in at pre development pricing with a 2 year rental guarantee.Autumn 2007 Project is way overdue after different “planning issues” and law suits with construction companies, none of which were communicated to owners. First units are finished and purchasers start to complete on a phased basis. Developer gives Christmas 2008 as new completion date for whole resort.  Sept 2008 Approx 70 out of 200 units have been completed and handed over to owners. Pool, gym, restaurants, theatres, shops, bars, etc are just shells. Rental guarantees which were originally to be paid quarterly but at the last minute changed to yearly are now due to the early completers.Oct 2008 Developer is placed in receivership owing $70 million. Receiver is given control of the whole complex, not just unsold units owned by the bank. 27 more units are finished but purchasers refuse to complete. Receiver instigates court proceedings to force them to complete.Receiver refuses existing owners access to use their fully furnished units in 2 of the 3 blocks due to health and safety issues (some work still needs to be done in common areas ) and also for security issues (concern over damage and theft ) and will only allow access to 3rd block by prior arrangement with him. Nobody is allowed to rent their unit out. Any owners who want to travel to Canmore to see their unit will be allowed to stay in the “open block”, but they have to pay the receiver $70/ night.   Feb 2009 Receiver is unsuccessful in his attempt to make 27 complete and they walk away with their full deposits plus interest which was being held in an escrow account by the developers lawyer.April 2009 Owners have had to initiate legal proceedings just to have their rights as owners acknowledged by the receiver. It appears receivers interest lies only in getting as much money back for the bank as possible..July 2009 Nothing has changed. No access to units. No rental income. Mortgages still have to be paid which some owners have now had to default on.Up until the day they went under there was nothing but a positive spin coming from the developer. Regular newsletters telling how great the resort was looking, invitations to owners to make sure they would be in Canmore for the soft opening of the resort. Even the international hotel group chosen to run Solara was advertising the resort on their website and all this time the developer had no money to pay the rental guarantees. The early completers are the ones who will suffer if the banks pull the plug at Campeche. If there are more hiccups (labour disputes, Grupo's finances etc.) and the site is left vacant this would be an extremely serious security issue. And lets face it, what sort of tourist looking for a 5 star vacation is going to pay to stay in the resort as it stands, would you?Now is our only chance to influence what happens next and we can only keep this power if we refuse to complete under the current circumstances. The units are worthless until the marina and golf course are completed and rental guarantees are backed up by actual tourists. Phase 1 has to exist as a complete entity for us to get anything out of this.If enough of us refuse to complete Grupo will have no choice but to negotiate with us. If they won't negotiate they only get 15% of the money (half of our deposits) they were expecting and they'll be left with three blocks of empty apartments which will be impossible to sell in the current climate. Good luck,GS "

" We are at the stage now where we have lost what little faith we had left in GM and would simply not complete until what was originally billed as phase 1, is finished (if ever?). Notwithstanding that, in the meantime we also intend pursuing them for return of our deposit. The longer time goes on the less effective will any arguments by GM for delay eg 'force majeure' become.Completely agree with gsproperty that the best way to bring GM to the table is to convey to them as forcefully as possible that most if not all people will simply refuse to complete. Turtle, simply cant understand your logic of even considering completing. The strongest weapon any of us have in the armoury for negotiation is the remaining 70% payment GM are wanting from us. Why would you hand any of that to them? Putting it bluntly I would rather be in a position where GM were trying to chase me for money (which frankly I dont have) Than me chasing them and at the same time be paying off a mortgage on a virtually worthless piece of real estate."
"I think they have sold at least 750 units so far. So if they can get everyone to complete in phase 1 they would get approx. 750 x $200,000 = US $150 million over then next year or so. This would give them enough cash to complete the rest of the development with the hope then of selling all remaining units in a mature development and a more recovered economy. Surely this must be what they are thinking now?"
"If everyone completed now, I think there would be no problems, the developer would have cash, the rental guarantees would get paid, mortgages would get paid and the development could continue as planned. If everyone does not complete then the developer will probably be forced to hand back 50% of the deposits to everyone and the development could be mothballed until the economy recovers. Since things are never black or white, I imagine a percentage of people will complete in which case the developer will most likely struggle on."
Did anyone hear from BBVA or one of the mortgage providers to find out what the Banks' think the apartments are worth. I seriously doubt that the properties will be valued at anything close to the original sale price.
"No, but I imagine they will be OK to lend on 70% of the unit/asset price (excluding the golf and marina memberships). I plan to apply for a mortgage and see the result so I can be in a position to complete or not. I don't think applying for a mortgage forces you to do either but puts you in a stronger position."
Think there are two reasons why very few people will complete:- Lack of faith in Developer's ability to complete the project as promised and on time- The units are not worth the price as stated on the contract.
"Legalex are seeking an additional $881 for negotiating with the Deceloper to cancel the contract or delay delivery. Unless this fee is paid within one week, they will no longer represent me.Has anyone else received this notice and paid?"
Yes most have already paid this. I paid a couple of months back now. This is 50% of the money that you still owe them to complete.
"hi everyone! just thought i would add my update based on going past the project the other day. i must say that the amount of work going on at the beach side condo buildings is impressive, with about 6-7 of them active with substantial numbers of workers scurrying about. this includes three buildings that are apparently being built by the ICA construction and engineering company, and that are the furthest along, with the exteriors pretty much finished. the other 3-4 are behind this schedule, with less workers in evidence, and no one seems to know who exactly is doing the construction. there is additional evidence of streets and other infrastructure taking shape here and there. however, as voiced by several others, this leaves open the question of what is happening with the golf course, marina, hotels, and other promised amenities, since no one i ran across could point to any serious work being done in those areas. however, i did hear that a new outfit may be starting in on the golf course again soon. i would say that, were i in the shoes of a buyer, which thankfully i'm not,i would be pleased that things are pushing ahead in whatever manner, since the more that is finished, the better the chances of the whole thing happening at some point. however, i would certainly be reluctant to cough up all the rest of my money now based on a valuation three years ago and assuming the completion of all the amenities that are so critical the value of a condo.in other matters, the old line PRI party that has always dominated campeche won the elections again, with both the new governor and the mayor of champoton coming from that party. so one could perhaps suspect that there will be some continuity in the political support for this project, which was started with huge political and financial support by the outgoing government of the state.until next time, have a great summer!"

"Great pics, TurtleBeach! I'm feeling a little more positive about the project after reading Legalex's initial report on the construction progress as well as quality of work. I don't care what GM didn't do or hasn't done. As long as there's progress and things are slowly back on track, that's what counts. I still believe it's going to be a good investment if one has the staying power."
"Check out the pictures on Nicklaus.com There are some new pictures including. Not sure if these can be transfered onto this sight. Has anybody spoken to other banks regarding US$ mortgages. I was told many months ago that HSBC may be prepared to offer their ""Premier customers"" mortgages. BBVA are currently the only option that I am aware of."
"I have no doubt that the development will be fully completed and built to a very high standrd and qaulity eventually. The resort will be of high value and all being well you could resell in 5 years at a substantial capital gains should you choose to do so.However, my current concern is the rental guarantee to help get us through the next 2 difficult years or site completion and market recovery. This is a reponse from my lawyer.""We are still waiting for the final rental contract that we have pressed Grupo Mall to forward to us so that we can advise on all the terms and conditions. This will in any event be a management contract and the rents will normally depend on the level of occupation. We believe it is unlikely that the management company will be prepared to provide any kind of bank guarantee or insurance to cover this. The rental guarantee is a misnomer as it is not strictly speaking a guarantee. For that, a third party should step in to take responsibility for any defect of the promising party. As is, it is only a contractual obligation. If the company fails to meet its obligations, one can sue but there is no automatic way to ensure that the rent is paid."""

Have people stopped posting on here?  Have received summons from Gruppo Mall to attend before Notary. My lawyers are advising not to do so as they are still waiting for many major things to be resolved. Presumably this is the case for many clients on here? 
"Looks like we are getting close to D Day. Constrction is making progress by some accounts but we are far from completion of the resort as described. Completion has been delayed beyond the contract stated date. It seems that Grupo Mall aren't offering any concessions to buyers that have altready paid the deposit. Their answer seems to be, pay up or lose your deposit. I haven't heard from Legalex in a while now and have no idea whether there is any possibility of getting all or some of the money back."
"hello everyone! hard to believe summer is over, but great to have football (american style, the real thing, that is!) back again! i haven't added my two cents worth lately since as i went past the project a couple of times in the last 30 days, as is mentioned in earlier messages, work continues on several condo blocks on the beach side, with 3 of them seeming to be finished at least from the outside. there isn't much sign of the golf course and other work, although there is a significant amount of activity in the area of the project, including a new on-site sales office. apparently grupo mall has been making a major push in recent months for mexican buyers.... could it be that europeans aren't buying the story anymore? now, don't get excited Turtle... i'm not trying to get cynical again! in a general way it's great to see all the work. but as the previous write says, D day is approaching. all of you have to be certain that if you cough up all your money, you are getting EVERYTHING that you paid for. let me emphasize that getting a ""summons to appear"" before a notary in mexico incurs absolutely NO obligation on you at all, it would merely be an invitation to appear, i assume to pay up and receive the deed to your property. however, a notary has NO legal standing as far as settling disputes is concerned, unless the parties request it as arbitration. so if you have legal counsel representing you and they seem to be working diligently, i would certainly advise that you follow their advice. legal stuff in mexico can take a long time, and i am rather certain that grupo mall cannot get away with arbitrarily canceling a contract and keeping a deposit if a good case can be made that they haven't fulfilled their side of the deal. so relax, check the legalities carefully, and don't get bullied by and ""summons"" from notaries etc. keep fighting and good luck!"
"Recently returned from a trip to Campeche. We can confirm, as has been noted previously, that there is a lot of activity on the three blocks on the beach. That of course is for the obvious reason of trying to get them handed over. To my eyes block 51 and its immediate surrounding area, was still probably about 2 months (from mid August) from being ready for occupancy.It was a good opportunity to view the quality of work (which appears to good) and to get a better feel for the layout of the place.The increased activity on the beach front blocks is, however, at the expense of progress on other blocks in the marina and golf appartments where nothing was happening.We were invited along to the inauguration of the new on-site sales office and this did seem to attract a lot of local political and media attention, unfortunately our very limited knowledge of Spanish meant that we were unable to pick up on a lot of what was said. They did say at that time that work on the hotel would commence in September.There appeared to be some work in progress on a few of the golf holes and indeed there were American engineers from Nicklaus on site to direct and advise on the shaping of the ground.The new section of highway to bypass has still not opened and they are now building a temporary access road off the existing highway to get to the first part of the development including the beach front blocks.We have not received any notifiction as yet regarding possible completion on our apartment (block 52) but our intention remains not to accept the apartment or pay the balance until substantial completion of the golf course and marina facilities including at least some shops and restaurants"
Likewise. I will only complete when the facilities promised over 3 years ago are finished. Its Grupo Mall who are in breach of contract and there is no way they can make anyone complete. I believe Legalex (representing Pure International buyers) are working in our best interest. The number of purchasers in Britain and Ireland using their legal resource is substantial and I believe Grupo Mall will have to negotiate with us. If they continue to be unreasonable I will not complete and sue them for payments made + compensation (although the only value in this project (SPV) is probably the land). I gather the developer has not responded to Legalex regarding any of their questions which sums up their attitude to buyers. If they don't have the financial resource to complete the project they should sell out to a better capitalised developer or possibly the contractor ICA who are now the lender and contractor. I am certainly interested to hear other peoples view as this forum has gone very quiet.
"Just noticed that the Westin Hotel has disappeared completely from the Starwood Hotels future developments revamped webpage. Also noticed that the Nicklaus website still only shows TBD as date of opening of the golf course.Cannot understand Grupo Mall's thought process in thinking that anyone is going to complete at this stage. Personally, I am pulling out as I have lost all faith in the developer and I can only imagine the problems there will be over the setting of maintenance charges etc if, in theory, I were to complete. Just hope I get 50% of my deposit back eventually- apparently GM can't resell the unit without the current purchaser signing a release and obviously you wouldn't do this until GM met their contractural obligations."
"I sgree with Robert (is that a first!). Grupo Mall can not force you to complete until they deliver the marina and golf.Lots of new information and photos here:www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php… Looks like that is scheduled for March / April 2010. So I imagine that would be the earliest I would accept handover.Note the new product, golf villas."
"Did anyone buy a unit in Building 51? I just received a mail from Mr Oscar Garcia Rodriguez of GM that they've started delivery of 51. The mail also asked if I'd like to look into a mortgage package as our building's next (52). There's no way we are going to take possession right now. While recent pictures have been encouraging, the area looks barely liveable. GM has got to be kidding on this. "
"I can't believe that anyone is considering completing on these units without any golf, marina, shops or restaurants on site. Also the rental guarantee isn't worth the paper it's wrote on as it isn't part of the purchase contract and even if they did follow through and pay it, you would be financially better off after 2 years if you left the unit unfurnished and unused as it's such a pathetic offer.There is also no point in saying your going to pull out and look for your deposit back if your unit isn't ready for handover as the developer is not obliged to do anything until 1 month after the completion date and they haven't received your final payment.The only way purchasers can come out of this without getting screwed is to sit tight and refuse to complete until the above facilities are provided. GM can't afford to loose us all and will have to sort out a solution with the banks if we stick together.My last post (no 157) might be worth reading again. It's now 2 years since the first owners completed at that development, they lost their court case, still have no rental income, still can't use their units without paying for the privilege and can't sell their units. GS "
"A small update: Legalex has written to say they'll be sending out communications to all clients regarding this purported handover. They believe we're in a strong position to delay till completion of marina and golf course as ""memberships are annexed to the contract and as such are a part of the contract. We will defend vigorously any attempt to complete in the present circumstances."" "
"I have sent Grupo Mall all the initial documentation they require for the mortgage aplication. This was sent to them many months ago (Mexico city office). They have asked for updated info, basically everything they have been sent plus an application form from BBVA. which is new. Has anybody sent this to Grupo Mall. It seems rediculous to ask for an update on all this information again.Would welcome comments from other purchasers in the beach appartments."
"GM are clearly getting desperate as my brother and I have now had a phone call from them saying we should complete (bld 51) as it is such good value.I think Legalex are finally understanding the feelings of their clients and I am much happier with their work than I was a few months ago. Our latest from them states they are losing faith with GM ever finishing the site. We have told Legalex that we would certainly agree to be part of a group claim for breach of contract (and I have kept the details of you guys who replied before).Personally, it is all such a shame as once completed I believe the properties will be worth in excess of our purchase price. GM could have kept us much more on side for, relatively, pennies. Instead they have treated us and, according to Legalex, our solicitors with complete disdain.We have said to GM, again, we will not complete until the facilities are finished. As that is probably a year away we have not returned any financial information."
"Yes, we've just received the e-mail update has promised by Legalex. And they have outlined the status of the project plus the alternatives left, as GM has not gotten back to them on all the outstanding issues they have presented.It is a true shame. The buildings look wonderful, the area is spectacular."
"I too received an update from Legalex. It seems from the letter that Legalex has had no joy in negotiating with GM. Some things that are clear from the letter are-- GM have run out of money. They have already mortgaged some assets to ICA. The legality of grant of this charge is questioned by some shareholders of GM in the courts- ICA's contract is for completion of the beach and marina blocks only. GM expected to pay ICA from the proceeds of completion. - GM have no ability to force anyone to complete and no one in their right mind is going to complete on an unfinished resort with no golf course, marina , electricity supply- rental guarantee is a sham.- there is no such thing as class action in Mexico.I have sunk a substantial amount of money in this development. I fear that most if not all of that money is lost. Legalex have indicated that legal action is likely to cost EURO 4,000 plus 10% of receovered funds. The only question in my mind is should I sink a further EURO 4,000 in the hope of getting some of the deposit back? "
"My first post on this forum - I am both an investor (Block 59 - so completion must be circa 2020) in this resort and the one that ""GS"" mentioned - Solara Canmore.I must strongly urge everyone to avoid completing on this project until ALL facilities are completed. I currently own a 2 bed apartment in Solara Canmore that I am effectively not allowed to access and therefore rent. A number of my fellow investors are defaulting on mortgages having poured additional money into legal action. In this scenario many of the mortgages were provided by HSBC who were the main backers of the project, which is exactly the same scenario here. It is in the interest of BBVA to offer mortgages to fund the resort and recoup wider financing costs.The key piece of advice is stick together - I'm afraid I can only see bankruptcy round the corner for this project regardless of the ICA participation. Sorry to be a doom monger but I wouldn't want anyone completing on apartments that they cannot effectively use."
"My first post also. I've committed to purchase a beach front apartment - block 52. Reluctantly, I also have no intention of completing the sale until Grupo Mall get their act together and come to the negotiating table. I'd rather kiss good bye to it all than waste any more time with this bunch of con-artists!! I really don't understand the position they are taking. No one in their right mind will complete the sale in the current circumstances. Surely they will eventually see the business sense in communicating with prospective purchasers before it is too late to save this project.Word of caution - as advised by LegalEx, I suggest people do not share any information on this Forum which LegalEx provide. Otherwise it will get back to Grupo Mall which may undermine the action we take."
"I am ""purchaser"" on block 51, no intention of completing as is,What are people's feeling on legal route? $4,000 seems like alot on top of everything that has gone before on deposits paid. Don't want to give up on the deposit but doesn't feel like we'd see any monies coming back to us"
"I am also not going to complete in the current situation as this would become a huge liability.It is a shame as the resort is starting to look good. If GM were to offer a proper rental guarantee + an agreement that no money needs to be paid for golf and marina memberships until they are fully ready and passed then it would make sense for everyone to complete and let the project be a success as there would be cashflow to pay the mortgages for 2 years for investors, whilst the resort fully completes and is funded by BBVA.In my mind it would only take these 2 simple actions to prevent bankruptcy for them and for this to succeed. Very strange that they are not intereseted in that."
"The only people who can force GM to come to the negotiating table are the Banks that have lend money on this project. For me to sink any more money in this project, requires the following to happen -- GM understand that prices have fallen since project inception and therefore cut the sales price drastically ( approximately 40-50%)- GM employ a professional project manager to complete the current phase, inclusing the hotel, marina and golf course- GM demonstrate that they have sufficient funds to complete the resort and that this money is held in an ESCROW account.Without this, no rental guarantee is going to change my mind. Unfortunately, the actions I've described mean real pain for the Banks. They have to write off 40-50% of the loan to GM. If these Banks believe that they will recover more of the loans by forcing GM into bankruptcy, then that is what they'll do. Campeche looks beautiful, the buildings look good, the resort has potential. My hope is that some years down the road, once the economy has recovered, another developer will come along and buy this project from the lending Banks and complete the project. In order to do that this new developer would have to buy us out of our deposit or part of our deposit. Let us hope for everyone's sake that the economy turns quickly and that a new developer is found in as short a time as possible.Unfortunately there is no painless solution. Let us see if the Banks have the apetite to take their medicine or whether we Investors are the only once left suffering through our loss of deposit."
Good summary of the likely outcome indiancamp - cheers
"New press release from GM. Now they are trying to sell plots of land to raise much needed money for the porject to go on...-------------------------------------------------(machine translation)--------As an excellent investment opportunity and in response to demand and interest that the State of Campeche had on development ""Campeche Beach, golf, Marina and Spa Resort"", group Mall makes available to stakeholders, residential lots""with excellent services and attractive prices and payment methods"". In a communiqué, the corporate reports that surrounded by a unique environment, the residential lots have a surface from the 800 m 2 and have a magnificent location within the Resort close to the Westin Hotel near of the sports marina and spectacular views to the golf course ""Jack Nicklaus Signature"".It is important to mention that these batches will have a special price for the inhabitants of the State of Campeche during the month of October, thereby increasing offer possibilities to enjoy to the full of the most unique ecological Resort of Mexico.Campeche Beach Golf Marina and Spa Resort this way endorses the commitment to take precedence in their projects and special quality customer satisfaction."
"Just spent the last half hour reading through a years forum posts not having known until today that a new forum had been set up after Trip Advisor closed down the last site. What is clear is that Robert from Tampa was right all along and the only person with a clear picture of what was actually happening on the ground or not as has proved to be the case.In June the Lawyer from Montreal who has purchased a unit made a good case for bringing an action and was confident of being successful. It was interesting to read a lot of people wanted to join them. What has happened to them since? Have any of the other purchasers joined him in pursuing a legal case against Grupo Mall?I am now being asked by Legalex to hand over more money t,4000 euro,to create a fighting fund. What is the consensus, does everyone else intend to fight their corner through Legalex?If all does go t***s up as it probably will and the developer goes bust does anyone know whether we will actually get anything back at all.Interesting to see that given all the problems with this development Turtle has continued to wear his rose tinted glasses all throughout the last year, nothing has changed on that score. - Merseyred an initial purchaser in Block 52."
"I won't be handing over any more money to Legalex. They want another 4000 EURO, which is almost $6000 in current money or roughly 10% of what i've paid by way of deposit. I'd rather enter into a 20% no win no fee contract than part with any more cash. I don't believe GM have any money to pay even if we win. As I stated in my previous posting, I consider my deposit gone. My claim on a property remains. If at some time in the future a new developer wants to buy this development , they may pay me a percentage of what is owed in order for me to release my claim. I have no idea when or if that will happen."
"hello all! sorry i haven't reported in for a while however once the NFL season kicks in, along with a bit of golf, getting away isn't quite that easy. however since i was invited down to cancun last week i grabbed a car and swung over to campeche. i appreciate the kind words from a recent participant about my reports, which have always been oriented towards simply adding my own observations and repeating what seemed to be credible bits and pieces of information from time to time. a few quick points..to me the most gratifying thing to see over the last year or so has been the increasing number of investors adding their say on this forum and i'm sure on others. i absolutely agree that sticking together on one general strategy is the way to go, regardless of whether you all have the same legal counsel. i couldn't give an informed opinion as to whether the amounts requested by the legal firm mentioned are reasonable or not. a major legal case such as this one will certainly cost a good bit of time and money, and i think it's important for each person to decide if they agree with the goals and the strategies of the law firm. if you do, perhaps a few thousand dollars is not too much to try to nail down the security for monies already paid and perhaps win the cancellation of your contract and refund etc. easy for me to say i realize! however, as i drove past the project and saw 6-7 beautiful condo buildings nearing completion on the beach, my gut feeling was that the sheer amount of work done and the investment made by ICA or whomever, means that critical mass may have been reached, meaning that ICA will have to stick around and take control, in order to recover their investment also. since they are a very solvent and serious company, i suspect that a competent legal firm will eventually be able to make a deal with them. i have also heard from well informed local people that much of the land where the project is located has liens or claims against it by ICA and/or others. one amusing thing i noticed was that GM has now flooded the entire campeche area with billboards and other advertisements about the project, including the offer to sell land as mentioned in this forum. as if the local campeche market was going to re-capitalize the project, which is hardly likely! to me it smacks of desperation in the face of all the problems which have been described. in summary, if i were a buyer in one of the buildings that is almost completed, i might be tempted to hang in there and fight, but i certainly would not be taking out any mortgage or loans to do so, and most definitely would not be sending any money to the developer under any circumstances. it will also be very interesting to see what the new state government in campeche will have to say, since the prior gov't was generally acknowledged to be a partner in the deal. whether the new guys see any benefit to them in going to bat for the project is yet to be seen. keep fighting and good luck! will be back in touch with anything of interest that comes my way."
"Hi guys - I have tried all sorts of ways to try to get my money back over the last 18 months. Grupo Mall have been less than helpful. By now I am resigned to thinking that my best option is to enter into the no-win no fee option offered by Legalex and to pursue GM for whatever I can get back as I think that this is probably the best option.From my own point of view, I went into this with my eyes open - realising that a risk is attached to any investment that you make - no one could have predicted the current global economic crisis that we currently find ourselves in and had the bubble not burst we might all have found ourselves in a very different position. I personally cannot and will not throw anymore money their way by completing on the mortgage on the following bases:GM have done nothing whatsoever in my view to allay any of the fears of investors. If GM are having difficulty getting others to complete then I don't see how they will have the capital funding required in order to complete the project.At the end of the day I guess it all boils down to one question: Why would you give someone thousands of pounds when they don't appear to communicate with you and when their figures don't appear to stack up?"
"In my view Legalex are not offering a no win, no fee. They want you to stump uo EURO 4,000 up front and if you win, they will take the EURO 4,000 off the amount you owe them. To me, that says that Legalex are not very confident of winning and therefore want to get EURO 4,000 up front. I don't intent to spend a penny more."

"Hello all,I am interested in litigation but the costs to do so individually seem prohibitive. Does anyone with links in Mexico know how the proposed law is going which will allow class actions? See the link below:www.shb.com/newsletters/ICAB/ICAB5609.pdfI've searched everywhere I can find on the net, with no joy."
"I want to inform you all, that Starwood (owner of the Westin Brand) has cancelled the managing contract with Grupo Mall."
"I have put down a deposit on a golf course apartment. I have just had a call to say that I can swap my golf apartment for a beach front apartment at no extra cost. As the golf apartments are not even off the ground, I guess the developer is trying to get cash upfront and sell any beach front apartments where buyers have refused to complete."
What did you say? Also did they indicate what would happen if you said no?
"I haven't replied yet but I have no intention of agreeing to the proposal. It would only be worth agreeing if I believed that all was well with the development. I don't believe that to be the case. If I agreed to their proposal, I would have to complete the purchase by year end. I will have to pay the remaining 70% due on the apartment and take possesion of a partly completed development that isn't worth the money I paid for it and, is impossible to rent out.I will let the forum know, what they say, when I refuse their proposal."
"Hi, I have been following this forum for a long time now, and I did not want to participate in it for privacy reasons but given the state of things I think I have to give my two cents. I live in Carmen City which is in the State of Campeche. I have heard a lot of things concerning the resort, I am in communication with people that worked for them and I have to say that things are not looking good for buyers. At the time ICA is funding Grupo Mall to complete 5 buildings, 3 on the beach and 2 on the marina and half the golf course. Nonetheless, ICA is financing because they were drag into a bad deal with GMall, and now they see and easier way at the other end of the tunnel rather than suing GMall for what they owe.So the agreement says that all the money from the completions of the building will go entirely to ICA until the loan is paid completly, and so ICA would get back some of the money they lost. Now the big problem here is that if ICA feels they have recouperated enough money form the completions, they can leave GMall to it's luck, and stop financing the project. Furthermore, ICA is only funding buildings that can be sold, so the yatch club, the golf club and the beach clubs are years away from being started. At least not before sales pick up, somewhere around the end of the current financial crisis.What buyers have to do is stick together and do not accept less than what we were offered, nevermind the rental gurantee which was born already dead, but the facilities that would give the estate some value closer to what GMall says they are worth."
"hi everyone... i haven't had a chance to come back down for a few weeks, but just wanted to confirm that everything the writer from ciudad del carmen says is totally consistent with what i hear from what i consider to be ""reliable sources"" in campeche. it would appear that the ICA construction company has all the leverage at this point, and the best guarantee for buyers might be if they slowly take over the whole project. we have also heard reports lately, not really substantiated, that the new state government is in talks with other mexican investors to come in and take a stake in the deal, which if true, would indicate that Grupo Malls' days are numbered. i also agree entirely with his suggestion to stick together, and to not make any more payments to Grupo Mall. why not get together and contact the ICA company directly? i suspect they would be very willing to meet and to discuss how you can all make this work. it seems that your only other options are to either sit back and see if Grupo Mall has the nerve to file legal action against you for allegedly not paying, or taking the initiative legally against them. from my rudimentary knowledge of the mexican legal system, i would prefer to simply put them on notice that you aren't paying until they comply with what they promised in your contract, and wait to see what they do, but not just what they huff and puff and say they will do. putting all the work into filing a suit against you (as a group) for non-payment implies a lot of legal work and a significant expense, and besides, would immediately create a public relations nightmare and scandal when both sides of the story hit the press and other media. once again, i am pleased to see more and more of you getting up on your hind legs and fighting for your rights!"

"Seems a shame some people might doing legal action rather than complete in April when marina is finished and 9 holes of golf finished. Seems that is a waste of money benefiting only the legal company, better spent on furnishing. Resort looks very beautiful now! and probably quite rentable by summer next year."
I guess it is the heard mentality of the british following the few who could not afford to complete and scaring people into legal action.
http://i38.tinypic.com/w8b1ty.jpgReposting above link- previous one was wrong.
I think these beautiful 2 bed condos on the beach are great value at only £150k that most paid. What can you get for that in england?
"I think robert is correct, "" i would prefer to simply put them on notice that you aren't paying until they comply with what they promised in your contract, and wait to see what they do"". This seems better than being conned by the legal company who could make hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees if everyone goes that direction. Then later down the line if you get refunded you will be kicking yourself when the new buyers come in and take over your apartments and then sell on for a much higher price when the recession has ended."
"Lets see what you can get for £150kCampeche playa, in the sunshinehttp://i33.tinypic.com/34rgjzs.jpgor maybe you prefer a flat like thishttp://i35.tinypic.com/30macso.jpgI think I will go and live in Campeche instead."
"hi again..... and here i thought ""Turtle"" was finally beginning to look at things in the cold, hard light of day!! really Turtle, your kudos to me for my suggestion that people wait until the promised amenities are actually built notwithstanding, i think you are going a bit overboard again pushing the virtues of the project and the value of the condos. i suspect that the prices mentioned, if that is what you all were supposed to pay, were probably pretty reasonable for a completed, quality deluxe resort. but that is simply not what you have now. probably because they are desperate for cash, grupo mall is pushing and pressuring people to make final payments, regardless of what may or not be finished around the condos in question. until the entire golf course is finished, and the marina, and some shopping facilities, and at least one hotel underway, i suspect the rental market will be extremely limited, especially when you consider that transportation into campeche still leaves a lot to be desired. and i think Turtle is being a bit unfair with his (sic) ""heard"" mentality comment (sure can tell he ain't never been to Texas, pardner!), since i think it's very prudent to seek competent legal representation in any dispute, especially one thousand of miles away from where you live. i am certainly not in a position to judge the merits and relative cost of the legal firm mentioned, but it would seem to me that the more people who join up, the stronger your case is going to be. as i've said before, if the legal strategy seems logical to you, it's just a personal opinion whether a few thousand dollars that may get reimbursed anyway, is not too much to put up to protect your investment. but as in my recent posting, if i were in your group, i might just notify them officially (copy stamped as received by them) to go stuff it until they complete each and every one of the amenities promised, or renegotiate the value of the purchase. another point... don't tell me that the value of the nearly finished condos isn't affected by the 8-10 half finished and abandoned skeletons all around them! i just remembered that it has now been TWO YEARS since the Acciona construction company of Spain stopped working on them! in summary folks, don't panic, don't get ""hearded"" into one position or another until you think carefully and decide what is best for you, your money already invested, and what use you may have for the condo in the future. i truly believe that ICA or other investors will take over this project and carry on, and one day it will live up to most of Turtle's high expectations... it's just not going to happen anytime soon. i'll probably be down there again next week and will report on anything i see or hear."
"What those of us who want to at least recover our deposits really need is a herd of lesser spotted Turtles, that are still willing to buy 2 bed 'condos' at the same price that was agreed for them three years ago. Never mind that the resort will not have the five start hotel, 18 hole golf course, proper transport, marina, or that the developer is at least a year late and on the verge of bankruptcy.My case is a little different from many of the posts on this forum, in that my 'condo' isn't even off the ground yet and therefore there is no chance that I am forced to complete. When (if) ever my apartment is built, I will do this calculation:If Value of apartment after Completion * probability of achieving this price > Final payment due, then I will complete. If for example, the completed apartments have an advertised price of $200,000 and I consider that there is a 75% chance that I can sell at that price then the expected increase in value is 50% of 200k = 100,000. If the final payment due is less than 100,000 then I will think about completing.I know one thing for sure and that is I will not take anything that Grupo Mall say at face value."
"Indiancamp, What do you consider a good price would be now for those beach front condos, if completing in April when the 9 hold golf course will be rady to use and the marina ready to use and the hotel under construction? I still think £150k is a good price as we bought when exhange rate was 2$ = £1 and we bought close to launch time when introductionary off-plan prices were being used."
"What bothers me more is that the mortgage has to be in Euros. So the USD amount borrowed is converted to Euros at time of mortgage application and that has to be paid back in pounds for most of us in the UK. ps. Robert, GM are not pressurizing us to complete at all right now. No correspondence at all from them after we said we will wait until the golf and marina is ready. I am guessing they will come back in April and force us to complete then."
I think the problem here is that people are not taking the long term view. Campeche playa was always meant as a 10 yea+r investment not a 2 year flip for speculators.
"I have two problems with Turtle's reasoning -1. There is no logical reason for thinking that Campeche Playa is the only property development in the world that has not seen price falls. As there is insufficient data on Capeche, all we can do is to say that at the time that the resort was launched, it was being advertised at a 40% discount to Florida property. If a 2 bed Florida beach Condo was $400k at the time of launch then with a 40% discount, Campeche was worth $240k. If prices in Florida have fallen let us say 30% then that Florida condo is now worth $280k and therefore Campeche is worth $168k. 2. Let us say you go ahead and buy the Campeche apartment which I think is worth let us say $168k for $240k, with a 10 year view because you are a long term investor not a nasty money grabbing flipper . Your investment will be worth $273,654 using 5% compounding for 10 years on $168k. Therefore in theory you will make a $33,654k profit over 10 years, or approximtaely 1.3% per annum. That is less than buying a government bond and does not take into account the huge default risk or mortgage payments."
"indiancamp, you logic is wrong.1st, Prices for Campeche playa were greatly undervalued at time of purchase as they were low off-plan prices for what the resort offers when fininshed on paper and they were bought at $2 = £12nd, Looking back in history property doubles in value every 7 years on average. ps. GM have already almost doubled the asking prices but don't think they can achieve that at present.3rd Campeche Playa resort has built in additional appreciation due to what will be the quality of the finished product, its location on the beach front, its facilities and its named golf course. If they all happen that is. I think they would if investors completed rather than running away from it.4th, Over 10 years the rent would pay off a portion of the mortgage or amount owed. All investors should buy with a mortgage not with cash in order to get leverag,e so long as the cash flow allow for that.However, nobody knows really how much prices will increase by over 10 years. Its all a guessing game based on intelligent guesses and from your gut feeling an imagination of what things can be like in 7 to 10 years time.What is more important for an investor however is cash flow. This is currently where i have a problem with Campeche Playa. I think it will be a liability to run for the 1st 2 or 3 years until rent pick up to cover the mortgage.What is needed for investor confidence is a very good RENTAL GUARANTEE which is higher than it offers now so that is can be marketed as a +ve cash flow investment!"
"ps, sorry for the spelling and grammar mistakes, can't be bothered to read through before posting and I type fast."
"Well I see Turtle making many assumptions: what the project will be, when it will be so and what will we recieve from GMall.The reason for my last note was to raise awarness and do not believe but what it is in front of your eyes.The condo is worthless unless the whole prject is completed. And what is the guarantee it will be completed? none. So unless your see it, dont believe it.Gmall is trying to sell a 2bed condo for 500k USD today. That's pretty much what the price will go up. Somebody buying today better not expect a premium.Lucky for us we bought very cheap, as we still may have an opportunity to make a buck. In 5 years minimum.Now April? I believe it when I see it."
Looking better by the day!http://i46.tinypic.com/qz16pu.gifhttp://i48.tinypic.com/24b67tk.jpg

Any developments that anyone is aware of? It has gone very quiet for a while now.
"Our friends at GM obiously not winning the popularity race:cincodias.com/articulo/…www.exonline.com.mx/diario/columna/824179Golf course is going very slow, we are looking at three or four holes for summer, since the problem with the road is still no looking good.Also there still are problems with the water system."
My Spanish is pretty basic - can anyone translate these articles?Cheers
"hello and happy new year to all! i haven't had a chance to get back down lately, but hope to soon, once the cold wave lets up a bit! in the meantime let me add a couple of quick comments to those such as Turtle Beach who have no doubt been missing my cryptic input....1. about the articles that were recently submitted, they are very interesting and continue to shed more light on the financial and other problems of grupo mall, in spite of their ever more feeble attempts to control the spin. the first article simply states that a major spanish travel provider, Barcelo, has sued them in madrid for 2.8 million owed for trips and other travel services to latin america. grupo mall naturally denies this, but apparently offered to trade some apartments at Campeche Playa to settle up, however Barcelo didn't take the bait. the second article, written by an established business reporter at a major mexico city newspaper, simply talks about both grupo mall and its owner, julio noval, being in ""financial free-fall"". the details given about the delays, attempts to pressure buyers into final payments for apartments delivered with no services, etc. are nothing new, however it's the first time i have seen it candidly laid out in a major mexican paper. 2. a couple of people who live in the area recently told me they were able to get into the most finished condo tower at Campeche Playa recently, and were surprised at both the small sizes of the rooms and the poor quality of materials used. according to them, bedrooms are hardly big enough for a queen size bed, kitchens are poorly equipped with outdated cabinets and appliances, outside jacuzzis are already rusting, etc. so it would be very important for anyone out there who has visited to give us their honest appraisal of what the finished product looks like. from all accounts it seems more and more likely that buyers will be dealing with the ICA construction firm in the near future, since they seem to have acquired legal rights over the buildings they constructed and the land underneath.hopefully i can deliver a first hand report of how the project is looking soon, in the meantime, keep fighting for your rights."
"Hi everyoneMyself and my husband visited the site at xmas 2009 because we were offered an alternative appartment to the one we purchased off plan.The road has made good progress although we do not know the finished date - but were told it is state funded and delayed as they have to build bridges over protected mangroves.4 holes of the golf course are under construction but no workers on site - delay here is not understood, but it appeared ready for turfing.marina seemed to be at a stop as everyone working on blocks.which is understandable as the company need us to complete to fund the remaining phases.One block finished but still on generator - could not tell us when it would be connected to grid.we were very disapointed that no solar power used anywhere with all that sun everything on grid.We were shown around the complex some of it impressive some not.The feeling of the place was lovely - great beach butThe appartments were smaller than we expected small doubles with built in wardrobes - yes you could only fit a queen bed Bathrooms were fine - nice enoughKitchen was tiny and fitted with poor quality units and appliances with a big freestanding fridge freezer jutting out - not suited to area at all. there is a small area at back of appartment housing water heater, air con and washing machine, kind of squashed into space. Living area small also and whole appartment too small for suggested furniture packageappartment built more to spanish space standard rather than usa or mexican.light fittings and doors were good and tiling was ok but again we would not say they were 5 star.our feeling was that co would agree to us completing on just the flat and not the golf and marina but we feel we do not know what we will end up with and are still unsure of what to dowe do not want to sue as we feel this will push company over edge mortgage finance is dubious peso rates are 13% us$ mortgages are not available to us - if anyone knows how we can get a dollar mortgage please let us knowour general feeling is that it will be a great place eventually but we dont know when that will bethere is no direct flights from UK so you would depend on us/canadian market for rental and they prefer hotels - there is an oil town 45mins away south with flights from Houston which could be a good source of renterswe would like to complete but will only do so if we feel what we bought into will be devivered - we love campeche and have priced similar properties in similar locations and pricing is ok but rental market is also dubious lots of competition - no direct flight - 5 star hotels all inc at good ratesI am going to contat the mexican embassy for further advise - i have a contact there"

"hi everyone! i was recently in campeche. thanks to Turtle for the update photos... no one is disputing that there is work going on at the project. i'm not sure why Turtle didn't add his usual upbeat assessment and recommendations to everyone. could it be that he saw the press reports over the weekend that at least 170 buyers have filed legal action in mexico against grupo mall and the ICA construction company for the return of their deposits, and also asking for full disclosure of exactly what ICA has rights to in the project, in order to have full transparency about who the real owner is at this point in time. this article was printed in the spanish newspaper Cinco Dias and was repeated in a number of newspapers in mexico. it's easy to find at google. from the comments mentioned there and in comments in this forum and elsewhere, it is apparent that grupo mall is making a real push to grab cash from anyone they can get it from. from my point of view and from what i personally saw, it is extremely simple. you shouldn't make a final payment until your apartment is completely finished, and until you are sure that you are paying the entity that currently holds ownership rights to the land underneath the building and the building itself. from all informed reports in campeche, this is now ICA and NOT grupo mall. that's why the request in the recent legal action for full disclosure of all this is so important and i applaud the legal counsel who realize this. another point... the electric line has reached the project, however the condo buildings have not been hooked up. there are about 30 transformers sitting under the cover of one of the other abandoned buildings, and one of the project engineers recently commented that they are currently negotiating with the government and the monopoly electricity commission about who pays the last bit of the bill for getting all this done. bottom line from me: continue to hang in there buyers, don't give in to any non-enforceable demands to pay up, and keep a close eye on this forum and on google for more news articles. the good news is that the campeche coast continues to grow and develop, with more projects large and small being started. there is too much money invested in Campeche Playa for it to be abandoned."
"The latest rumour is that BBVA who was granting 70% mortgages of the apartment price in principle to buyers is now pulling out of the arrangement completely. If this is true, it will have serious consequences for the success of the resort unless alternative finacing if found."
"we bought 2 beach apartments and planning to visit the area in 3 weeks time. thanks for all your comments.Some of our thoughts, and please forgive me for my poor englishFrom our point of view the most convenient action now is to help to get the proyect finished (even thought we dont know when that would be). We will sign in Mexico as soon as possible in view of the potential demands from other buyers... we are concern about the posibility of a bankarupcy of mall group and then we would have to fight legally in Mexico, getting nothing at the end. So in present circumstances, our decision is to go there , sign the contract, and keep waiting.We made an investment, that is not going as expected, but we assumed the risk and even though we feel also lots of frustration, we prefer not to fight now with the Mall Group to avoid further problems.Best regards from Madrid"
Had a telephone call from the Developer offering to exchange my Golf course apartment for a 'larger' beach front apartment if I'm ready to complete. I don't think my building is even off the ground as yet. Has anyone else received such calls. What are poeples' thoughts on this?
"I think you would be mad to complete on anything.You would be surrounded by a building site for at least the next 5 years (note that GM are now advertising plots for sale on the website, located where golf apartments were originally planned) with no guarantee that there wouldn't be further changes to the original plan- how about some social housing on the perimeter!"
"Grupo are offering you the apartments which existing owners are refusing to complete on. These clients are now disputing their contracts through the courts so if you accept a beach unit your ownership of the unit could be in jeopardy depending on the outcome of the law suits. 2 sets of contracts floating around on each unit, very dodgy ! These cases could go on for a year or more.Looks like Grupo want to get as much cash in without doing anymore construction work ie sell you a partially finished unit, get deposits on any new plots they dream up and no doubt get a fresh deposit from someone for your golf unit if you accept the beach unit.Why don't the owners of the golf units just get off the fence, either complete on a unit or join the group trying to sort this out. The more who commit, the larger the war chest, the better the prospects of a positive outcome for all owners."
Hi I too have had a phone call asking me whether I would like to exchange my smaller apartment for a beachfront apartment. This is extremely worrying and in my opinion demonstrates how desperate the developer is to off load apartments any which way it can. I dont believe that my block has even started to be built yet either!
"Has anybody looked into their contracts to see if Legalex have fulfilled their duties adequately? As mentioned previously, I own a golf unit. I don't believe that constriuction on these units has even started, yet all my 30% deposit seems to have been handed over. On top of that Legalex have the nerve to ask for a further $5,000 to begin the process of trying to negotiate a way out of this mess."
Does anyone know of any group legal actions against Grupo Mall other than Legalex (who seem exorbitantly expensive)?
I heard that the developer has now filed criminal claims against all its buyers as a counter suit supposedly for damages that have been caused to the developer by their buyers actions. I guess they are trying to negate any refunds that they have to legally make now with a damages claims.
Any new developments?
Not heard anything at all recently. Anyone else?
"hi sports fans... i had a quick jaunt down the coast last week and got out just before the heavy rains hit from the tropical storm arrived a couple of days ago. there is still work going on at the project, and two large buildings that appear to be next to the marina have resumed work at least on a limited basis, after starting and stopping several times. the 7 buildings done with the investment from the ICA construction company seem to be all finished and ready to occupancy, except for a few minor details such as electricity not being hooked up yet. there was no sign of any new work on the golf course since a couple of months ago, at least the section that is visible from the road. reliable people in campeche continue to insist that ICA is firmly in charge of the project now, with liens on most of the land and rights to collect payments from buyers. there hasn't been any more huffing and puffing from grupo mall for a while, and i would not take any threats from them to sue buyers very seriously... they have enough problems of their own at the moment. the new state government in campeche, unlike the previous one that was heavily involved in the project, has remained neutral in the matter, refusing to either support grupo mall's position or to assist buyers seeking redress against the lack of compliance with their purchase agreements, and just stating that they have confidence that things will get sorted out in due course. my instinct tells me that there are negotiations going on between grupo mall and ICA to determine when grupo mall is to be shown the door, and probably between ICA and those representing groups of buyers who have already filed legal action against grupo mall. as long as buyers hold firm about not paying the full price for these condos until they are given what they are promised, i think they will get some satisfaction at some point. will keep in touch as anything new shows up, good luck all."
"Hi there... just a quick note to confirm that, as i predicted in my earlier message above, the construction firm ICA has officially taken over the Campeche Playa project, and the Spanish Grupo Mall and the Noval clan have been given the boot, not a moment too soon in the opinion of most informed local observers. a full report can be downloaded at the newspaper www.tribunacampeche.comaccording to the report, the final straw came when grupo mall refused to release any accounting records showing what happened to funds received from buyers, as well as what happened to between 200-300 million pesos of public funds received from the previous state government. local congressional representatives are demanding that the Novals be brought around to explain where all the public money went. my next prediction: this will be a large step forward for the project. the ICA company can start a new chapter, re-negotiate prices and/or payment conditions with buyers, and can now invest additional funds into the infrastructure of the project with the knowledge that they will be running the show. at least there can be no question as to their financial ability to perform... just one example... ICA just signed an agreement with Mexican government backed middle class housing funds to build 35,000 homes in the next few years, and they are also one of Latin America's largest general contractors, and are partners with the American Flour Corporation in many projects.for buyers, this doesn't mean that all issues will be settled overnight, but it does clear the way for positive developments. will continue to report as events warrant."
I am new to this but my wife and I are going to Sabancuy to look at property but I'm not sure who the developers are but obviousily need to stay away from some of these developments But which Ones ?? HELP !Thank-you..
