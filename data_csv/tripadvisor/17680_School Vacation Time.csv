"We are visiting Paris during the first 2 weeks of April - can anyone please tell us what the weather will be like (we won't hold it against you if you are wrong - lol) and when the school vacation period is.Are school vacation times the same throughout France, Italy and Greece?Any help will be greatly appreciated.cheers from down under"
"Make sure you book your hotel as the time period you are asking about also involves vacation time from other countries such as well Japan , USA, New Zealand, and Sydney etc.! The rooms book up quickly during Easter and spring break.The weather is hard to predict but when I have gone sometimes it is cold and windy, sometimes cold and rainy, and sometimes sunny and cold. I always bring a rain coat and layer clothes. "
"School holidays starting 31st March until 15th April are England, Germany and Belgium. Also France Zone A which is Caen, Clermont-Ferrand, Grenoble, Lyon, Montpellier, Nancy-Metz, Nantes, Rennes and Toulouse. Luxembourg is on holiday from 31st March until 8th April. Switzerland is on holiday from 24th March until 15th April. Then from the 8th April until 22nd April France Zone C which is Bordeaux, Cretil, Paris and Versailles.Sorry I do not know about Italy. The problem with your two weeks is that Easter is the week-end of 6th - 9th April and this is peak school holiday time. If you are trying to avoid school holidays then pick 17th March to 31st March or 14th April to 29th April when it would be the last week of Zone C and Zone B for both weeks.Good luck"
"Thank you all for you extremely helpful information. unfortunately for us from Australia, the reason we are travelling at this time is that it is school holidays in Sydney. Just our luck it seems to be practically a world wide epidemic. Cheers"
"As we french say, ""en Avril ne te découvre pas d'un fil"" or as we germans say, ""April, der macht was er will"", or ""Grüne Weihnacht, weisse Ostern"" even more, ""Noel au Balcon, Pâques au tison"", basically In English it means you should be prepared for all kinds of weathers, even snow!"
