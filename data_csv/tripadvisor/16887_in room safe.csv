"Had 9 day stay recently. 3 at Bellagio,3 at Ceasars,3 at Aria. On my trips I take bank envelopes and write date and amount on each . First 3 days at BellagioI kept money on me,also day 1 at ceasars. Then put in safe last 2 days at Ceasars and all 3 at Aria. Never looked in envelopes until home for 8 days as I never touched the envelopes for last 4 days . When looking the envelopes where ALL short $300, only possible reason some one got into safe at Ceasars or Aria. I know maittnence workers have pass code to open locked safes. Since It was not noticed until home no reason to report it as othe posters have said missing things from room safes or not covered by casino with no proof. Just thought I would pass this on, myself I will NEVER use a room safe again Fladoc"
"Thank you for the reminder. In recent years, I NEVER use a room safe for storing money. The postings here at TA are excellent reminders. I thank all OP for sharing their experiences."
"Here we go again, the old room safe broken into, LOL"
"Thank you. As we all know, unlike criminals elsewhere that'll just go make a quick grab of stuff out in the open, criminals in Vegas take the take to meticulously go thru people's safes, counting the money and deciding what to take. And we're glad to know that you managed to get home and not even care about that money for another 8 days."
Were there $12.00 in ones left behind?Edited: 7 years ago 
"No just the rest of hundreds ,no dollar bills left"
"Struggling with the motives of a thief who doesn't want all of the money. Let me go to to the trouble of entering the room, entering the safe, going in to different envelopes...but leaving money behind. If I'm a thief, what have I gained by doing that?Of course, if I'm a traveling companion, spouse, ""friend"" or whatever...that's different. They would just take ""some"" of the money in hopes the owner might not even notice."
It's an epidemic.
This one is not even worth commenting on.
"Here we go again. Let's all assume that the OP (or someone they they traveled with) stole the money and is lying. What is to be gained from posting on this board, other than to try to share his learnings with everyone else?Time for all of the grumpy ""experts"" to retire from this board."
How much was in the envelopes originally? just curious
"I think someone had a sniff of the barmaids apron when in Vegas.These thieves who take just enough to get by on are remarkable. We could do with some of them over here instead of the @Â£""%#^*}*% who take anything that's not nailed down and leave the place a tip.CheersDavy !!!"
"I believe the OP. although I still use the safe and have not had any probs.It is scary since your only other option is to keep all your cash on you,I only use the safe so i wont get really stupid liek i have on some trips and blown my whole wad pulling an all nighter. But my wife has always put her ipad in the safe and at CP we havent had any probs,but I dont think its a matter of any certain prop being safer than another. as far as the envelopes all just missing $300, that is not far fetched. we have a now ex employee who is now in jail,do something like that with our shops cash register. he took a certain amount out on hios last day,but left enough $ in the register so it appeared as if nothing was missing,same can be said for someomne taking out $300, the idea being the guest may not notice how much was missing since they may just assume since the env still had cash in it then it must still have what they put intoi it?. I forget the whole pre set safe combo someone posted a long time ago where some may open with a combo of all zeros or something like that, . but even if thats the case,how can we as guest get that pre set combo un done?"
"Looking at Fladoc3's post history, there's an aura of truth to the claim.For grins and giggles, let presume it's all true. The answer to ""why would a thief not take everything"" is actually pretty simple -- it's an inside job, and they're hoping you either won't notice at all, or you won't notice until long after you're gone so that it's virtually impossible to correlate back.Now, when I said ""inside job"" -- I don't mean staff. I mean your friends/family. Fladoc3, is it at all possible your travelling companion(s) might have helped themselves and hoped you wouldn't notice or thought you just made a mistake?"
"""This one is not even worth commenting on.""Yet you did? Fantastic. To the OP-Im so sorry this happened to you. I know how you feel! We had money stolen from our safe a couple of weeks ago. Of course all of the pros will blame someone related to you... Just ignore them. :) I KNOW this happened to us and it sounds like the perfect crime. Also- I don't find it odd that they only took a portion of the cash?? Your thief was smarter than ours! LolIt would be smart to take a little in hopes that the victim wouldn't notice till they got home, in hopes that nothing would be reported. Op is home and does not plan to report it. The scumbag thief got away with it."
"I am hoping to keep my iPad in the safe, why is it they are just stealing cash but not items? Or atleast I dont see items being taken"
"Sorry, but this is just silly. If your room has an in-room safe, while using it does not guarantee anything, it's still safer than leaving your valuables in your unlocked luggage or lying about the room. If your luggage can be locked that is a good alternative to the in-room safe, or you can have your valuables places in the hotel's main safe if you don't need to access them frequently, and THAT makes the hotel responsible if anything happens to them.I just don't see why someone would fail to take advantage of something that's convenient to use and at least decreases the likelihood of being robbed by a non-professional thief."
"Legit robbery or not, I am seriously contemplating making hubby use the safety deposit box when we go next time. I do not want to walk around with our entire bankroll as it would attract pickpockets but am becoming leary of using in room safes after hearing horror stories on here."
USE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES!In room safes are a joke. How many people have to post stories about getting ripped off before the masses realize this is an actual issue?
"fungirl- I tried at Bally's, asked for a safe deposit box. Said they didn't have them. "" we have safes in the rooms."" We did use our room safe with no problem but do like boxes better. Feels much safer."
Anyone know if the Flamingo has Safety Deposit boxes?
"vegasjunkymn, we will be at Wynn and I do know for a fact they have them there! :) My brother in law uses them all the time. We have been to Vegas somewhere between 30 and 40 times and always used our in room safe never questioning the safety of our money and never having an issue. BUT... after hearing about it on here... beginning to think differently! :) NOT a chance I want to take honestly when we have other options available to us!"
I take travelers checks so I guess the thieves would not want them. Would that be a correct assumption?
I stayed in the Wynn with my husband last August it was our first time to Vegas ! We put our money in the safe and headed out the first morning really excited. My husband asked me did I close the safe and I said yes we then went shopping for the day and when we got back I went to open the safe but it was already open ! I nearly died as the door fell open we were so lucky our money was all there as housekeeping had been into clean. Moral of the story is check and check then check again ! I'm back again early November staying in the Cosmo and after seeing some of the posts I will be asking for a deposit box.
"fungirl, that's great . Not all places do so not many options. The Wynn is not in everyones price range."
"Another reason why I don't believe this:""Since It was not noticed until home no reason to report it as othe posters have said missing things from room safes or not covered by casino with no proof.""Well, they do have cameras in the halls. And they would easily be able to track the room card usage to see who entered the room.I also find it strange that at the beginning of the trip, this person would walk around with all of his money. Near the end of the trip, he starts whatever money he has left in the safe."
Hi Vegasjunkymn we came from Ireland and got a really good deal on flights and hotel midweek we hadn't got a clue how nice the Wynn was until we arrived ! It was great
"I bet the people you travel with could figure out the 4 digit code...i.e. your birth date or year, last 4 of social. Most people use the same pin for everything."
Bluff: At Wynn the safe is in the closet. There is absolutely no reason for the maid to be looking in the closet under normal circumstances.
OK for a test I left $500 in $100 bills out in plain sight on the desk in my hotel room every day for a week.No one ever took it but I got some notes from housekeeping that I should not leave that much money leaving in plain sight.
just put a fake rat in the safe on top of your money
>>OK for a test I left $500 in $100 bills out in plain sight on the desk in my hotel room every day for a week.No one ever took it but I got some notes from housekeeping that I should not leave that much money leaving in plain sight.<<Wow you are more trusting than me
"No one in housekeeping is going to steal your money. It's not worth losing their job over and they can tell every key and time going in and out of your room.All of the ""my safe was robbed"" stories are BS !!"
Lol kerplooey! I'm going to invest in a fake eat from the joke shop!
I keep a large rat trap in my luggage to put in my safe......but usually by the last day there is no need to use it any longer.....
Geocip - You soooooooo crazy! LOL!
"These threads kind of remind me of the frequent safety posts on the Mexico forums, we started a drinking game each time there was a new one.I'll have a tall Grey Goose & soda with lime please."
"Where do you cash in your travelers checks? Casino Cage? Has anyone had a problem cashing them in, even though there a little more work. I've never used them. Just thinking."

I'm still very dubious about these theft from safe stories. I've always used then and never had any trouble.There always seems to be an underlying reason for the theft. I blame the husband generally.Us men are typically a bunch of sly B@*%$*^&%CheersDavy !!!
JupiterJoe I have never had a problem cashing TC's at any cashier cage at any casino. It is the only way I will travel with a large amount of money. I get American Express U.S. TC's.
Kitty K: That is just what I was looking for. Thank you.
We too use Travelers checks and have never had a problem getting them cashed with proper ID.
"Bit old now but don't underestimate the actions of one person. It's never going to be a conspiracy on this level, but you can see why the unsavoury might see people could be exploited in a place like Las Vegas.I went to the Maldives on an all inclusive, and did not spend a penny (dime). I had one hundred dollars square in my safe. On day four I had ninety dollars. It was a resort that everything could be charged to the room, and everything we had was. I would lay down the life of everyone I have ever loved that my husband had not dishonestly taken 10 dollars from our safe, yet it was gone. Simple facts. So it's most definitely not a large scale thing, but thieves have all sort of guises."
"Yawn, Yawn,Yawn !!!!!"
Was that yawn at me? I'm sorry. I was not talking to you directly so feel free to ignore.
I am sorry that you were robbed I do not mean to make light of it.On the other hand here is something that is sure to stop thieves.......DO Not look if you are easly offened.unfinishedman.com/brief-safe-the-benefits-ofâ¦
"Actually I have just had a look at your posts. The suggestion to ignore is now an instruction. I have a happy life and home, and come on here to live vicariously or offer useful advice. There are many trolls of differing influence on various forums. On this one it is purely to belittle and I am most definitely above it."
wait they stole 10% of a $100 ? well if only $10 was missing consider yourself lucky
"Of course it's lucky, it's the price of a sandwich. It's still horrible from people you see each day,smile at, say thank you to...... If yo had a maid would you be okay with them helping themselves to your 'cheap' groceries? Of course not, no one expects to be stolen from on any level."

Does anyone use travel safes? Saves you worrying about random people entering unlocked rooms (when doors don't lock properly) or using special codes to unlock the standard room safes.Amazon have a few different ones listed and you could probably find some in luggage stores.
Why wasn't CSI brought in to dust for prints? And blood splatter? They can also spray the bed sheets and can tell who has been naughty!
Just because it amuses me......Yeah it's a slow day
