"Good evening,I have a booking for a hotel in the Loch Tay/Kenmore area June 19th. Are hotels actually allowed to be open then? I can find nothing clear online. The hotel originally had a page of covid 19 info on their site, but not any longer. My flights have been cancelled, all my other hotels have cancelled on me, I am just left with this one. Contact with them is a little evasive. But it is a pricey stay, that I cannot really afford to lose. Thanks you for your thoughts."
Best make contact and tell them of your predicament.
"""Are hotels actually allowed to be open then? ""No one currently knows."
"Very few are open at all, here in Glasgow even top rated Hotels are Closed.The next round of easements is expected to centre around being able to sit in Parks and Garden Centres being opened up.If you mention what Hotel it is maybe someone will know for sure."
Our hotel cancelled our holiday for June 22nd in ScotlandSomething about restrictions being lifted around July 4th?? Not sure where that came from
"Even if hotels are permitted to open at a certain dates, there’s no certainty your hotel will. They nay need time to do a deep clean, recruit and/or train staff etc."
"I was supposed to be staying in a hotel in Glasgow on 11th June but have now cancelled.I looked at the hotel website and all dates are blocked out until the beginning of July, so obviously they aren't taking any bookings; although there is nothing on the website to say they are closed!Fortunately I used the ""free cancellation"" option on booking.com so don't have to worry about trying to get a refund."
"The OP knows they aren't going to get here, but their concern is that one hotel is being evasive about refund."
"Thank you everyone.There was no refundable option when we booked, sadly. I also used booking.com and I may try to work through them for this issue. I book lots of hotels with them, and I find they are often helpful. Hotel is Loch Tay Marina, no secret. I asked for a refund, they are not keen and offered to change dates. considering travel without medical insurance internationally will be a problem, changing dates is impossible really. I guess I will call the week before the ""stay"" and see if they actually are receiving guests. If they are then it is more my problem than theirs. If they are closed I will push harder for a refund.Edited: 8:12 am, May 19, 2020 "
I think that is self-catering accommodation?i have stayed there several times and found them easy to deal with.Keep on asking for a refund.Even if they are allowed to open it is very unlikely that any local restaurants will be available.It's a pity as it it is a very attractive area.I hope you can come again in the future.
"The OP has wisely noted that travel insurance doesn't cover for Covid19 and doesn't wish to take the risk while the virus is still around. Understandable.With everything else cancelled they need to know how this one will behave.From the Telegraph (fairly respectable) is ""However, the British tourism industry has responded to the loosening of lockdown by gearing up for a July 4 reopening.""What sort of reopening is a moot point and no guaranteesEdited: 1:30 pm, May 19, 2020 "
"""However, the British tourism industry has responded to the loosening of lockdown by gearing up for a July 4 reopening.""The Telegraph speaks for conservative England, and its advice will in all likelihood apply in England. Scotland seems to be following a somewhat more delayed path to re-opening, and I think Holyrood will reveal some details of that on Thurday. I doubt they'll put dates on each step though."
"""From the Telegraph (fairly respectable) is""However, the British tourism industry has responded to the loosening of lockdown by gearing up for a July 4 reopening.""Not so respectable. There has been no loosening of the lockdown in Scotland. (Apart from being allowed out to exercise twice a day)"
"I have been the the marina this winter, to check it out. My brother was supposed to get married in Fortinagall this June, sadly all cancelled. Such a stunning area, which we will certainly return to. But totally impossible to do much else besides get a refund. The travel industry will be paralysed if we cannot get travel medical insurance that will cover covid 19. People will just have to stay closer to home. My brothers lives in Perth, really tough not being able to see him, especially with the wedding cancellation"
"I expect that, as things calm down a little, Insurance companies might offer insurance excluding CV, at reasonable prices. They might also start to cover CV but expect such policies to be VERY expensive. They will rely on stats when setting prices, just like the bookies do on horse races. Stats right now are unreliable."
"You could try looking into World Nomads for insurance. Their policy has some COVID-19 coverage for Americans (not sure about Canadians)Edited: 11:33 pm, May 19, 2020 "
"""The Telegraph speaks for conservative England, and its advice will in all likelihood apply in England. "" Calling England conservative when Scotland is taking an even more conservative approach seems an odd choice of terminology."
#15 world nomads is not available to Canadians.
"Have you logged into Booking.com to check your options? This implies that if you are unable to travel then there are options for a non-refundable booking. My friend got a refund on one and i'm sure that was booked through them. If the hotel is closed then I they can no longer provide the service you booked so you should get a refund, although many are trying to get people to rebook for later dates as they can't afford to issue refunds on all bookings.https://www.booking.com/covid-19.html…"
"Well, what a shame that World Nomads is not available to Canadians. Safetywing is another travel insurance company that has some pandemic coverage, but looking on their website it looks like it also is not available to Canadians. Sorry. This makes a difficult situation even worse. I hope things work out for you."
"#19 Yes indeed, logged in many times. Only option currently is to ask nicely for a refund. Which I have done of course."
"How did you pay? If by credit card you may be able to get the money back from the CC company if the hotel is not open for your booked dates as they will be in breach of contract.This is the Scottish government roadmap for easing lockdown, NO specific dates. https:/…Edited: 1:57 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"#22, A chargeback through my cc is certainly an option. They worked hard to get my flight refunded instead of a voucher. Hopefully do not have to go that way.It is tough on everyone really, businesses and travellers alike."
"Update - with the help of booking.com the hotel fully refunded my stay. They were friendly, polite and I will go to stay there when we are able to travel internationally, and be insured medically."
Nice to hear of a positive outcome.
Well done Loch Tay Marina.Credit where credit is due.And many thanks to the OP for coming back.
