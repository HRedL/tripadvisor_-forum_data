"From Diario Libre ( you can use Google Translate in Google Chrome to translate original article if necessary) - The DR govt is moving ahead in wanting a July 1st opening for tourism.https://www.diariolibre.com/economia/gobiern…The Government and Association of Hotels and Tourism of the Dominican Republic (Asonahores) announced this Wednesday the approval of the health protocol to be applied in the tourism sector and ratified the reopening of its operations from July 1.The announcement was made today after a meeting held by the Ministers of Tourism, Francisco Javier García and of Public Health, Rafael Sánchez Cárdenas, with Asonahores representatives, led by their President, Paola Rainieri, and Andrés Marranzini, Executive Vice President.The health agreement covers all the subsectors of the tourism industry and clearly explains what to do in each case, which guarantees the well-being of national and foreign tourists, as well as employees.""With this protocol we ensure that those who visit us can fully enjoy our tourist centers and enjoy the greatest guarantee of health,"" said Minister Francisco Javier García."
"It would be nice if they actually released it to people in the industry. Everything here is ""make a statement"" but don't say anything. Very Frustrating."
"What does this really mean though? Seems like empty words with no actual substance or clarity to the public about what this entailsEdited: 5:12 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Yeah hopefully, you all will have this very soon. July 1st is 7 days away. This is DEFINITELY cutting it pretty close. But at least it is some progress and good news as the govt is ""still aiming"" for a July 1st reopening."
"There has been lots of announcements pointing to a July 1st ""re-opening "" including, airlines announcing flights, hotels announcing re-opening (HR being one on 1st of July) and PUJ providing updates on new protocols so nothing new other than things are moving forward."
"I would say they are opening July 1st at this point though many resorts are not rushing to be the first to open with their current level of bookings and resorts with multiple co-located properties are only opening a property or two (usually a adults only and one family property) so they can consolidate bookings from the other properties and keep the ones open at a reasonable level. That said gradually more are opening up later in July and even more on August 1st. There are still a few waiting till September, October and November 1st though to gradually get most re-opened by then. I had looked at booking CHIC in late August and early September but they don't open till September 1st now for example so I am likely going to try and go with another property but its still a bit undecided as I have not booked anything yet though. I do regret not trying to book earlier when some resorts were offering cheaper deals than now though. I don't think current pricing is moving back down too much though and the airline offer I want is going away in less than a week so I have to decide soon on that."
"If anything, I like the fact that CHIC has delayed their re-opening. Bit of time for them to evaluate things, get ready for guests."
"Thank you, Cat SHow do you feel about this? Would you travel in July?"
"This virus is exploding again. I’m just not seeing anything close to normal for a long time. In the US....NY NJ, VT are already trying to put quarantines in place again For anyone that travels to a hot spot area. Their cases are down! They want to keep it that way. Today, the US set a record for new cases. I just don’t see this going well.. July in my opinion is a pipe dream. I’m now worried about my December trip. The DR isn’t stupid, they’re seeing what’s happening. Do they want tourists back spreading CV19 or do they unfortunately keep it shut down. I feel terrible for workers around the world that are impacted. This is crazy.Edited: 8:14 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"i wouldn't be going to the DR or China .. definitely not july , aug or Sept ."
I'm going to the DR in November. I have never had any desire to go to China
I am actually waiting to see if they do open on July 1! I have been watching a lot of videos of people arriving at resorts in Mexico for the first time after their reopenings.They opened June 8. The death rate and cases is a lot higher in Mexico than the DR. I am looking to book for August. Will wait and watch everyone’s videos. I am sure all resorts will make it safe for all tourists. Everyone just has to be prepared to enjoy their vacations in a new normal all inclusive resort!
"Has anyone heard anything about grand Palladium delaying reopening? I am sceduled for November, but would feel more comfortable if resorts had been opened for a while"
beckrz while the number of cases as a whole is high in the Cancun and Riviera Maya (Quintana Roo State) there have not been that many about 2700 of which most have already recovered only 350 are active. That said their death rate compared to total cases is very high at about 18% which may partially relate to quality of care but I think most likely they had a lot more cases than they indicated and only counted those going to get treated at the hospital. Regardless the 350 active cases is quite low though. I am looking at August ideally as well but nothing has been booked yet.
"Update from Diario Libre June 26, 2020President Medina Reiterates July 1st Opening for Tourismhttps://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/medin… - Translated via Google Translate through ChromeThe reopening of tourism in the Dominican Republic, next Wednesday, July 1, will bring relief to many areas of the country that live from this activity, President Danilo Medina said on Friday .However, the president said that the sector will not be exempt from risks due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic .""For this reason, we have proposed that they begin gradually to resume their activities from July 1,"" he said during his speech on Friday night to the country.The tourism sector, worldwide, has been the most affected by the disease due to restrictions on commercial flights as a measure by governments to control cases of contagion.Tourism is one of the pillars of the Dominican economy, which left the country with revenue of $ 7.468 million for 2019. Last year, the Dominican Republic received 7.5 million, among tourists who entered by air and cruise passengers.In addition, the sector generates some 300,000 direct jobs and many more indirect ones.The sector stopped in March when Medina closed the borders due to the coronavirus on March 19."
$7.5 million is pretty low... what's the normal revenue per year there?
Never trust Dominican numbers! LOL
So tourism brought in 7.4 millions $ with 7.5 millions visitors. So less than a dollar per visitor. Not a great business.
Maybe they wanted to say 7468 millions what would be 7 billion and 468 millions?
"I'm with MIke, don't trust the numbers... in ANY country. In saying that, I do believe the numbers in my home province,,, we were / are so lowww that they put out callings to PLEASE come to the hospitals for treatments etc. as they were / are so empty they were like ghost towns :-) (oh, and not making any money LOL)"
