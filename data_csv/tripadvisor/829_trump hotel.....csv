just saw a posting on facebook that said all of the las vegas hotels have donated food & had their rooms used for emergency personel except for one--that being the trump hotel....does anyoneknow if this is true?
I would expect a tweet from him saying that he has given more food and charity than everyone else combined. In the history of man kind.
...and that it was a beautiful donation. Maybe the most beautiful donation ever.
Sounds like classic fake news to me - the food donations by hotels is true but I doubt they would have used their rooms even for emergency personnel when they are in lockdown
"I think posting on facebook says it all. Too many people believe too much BS posted on social media.Edited: 5:56 am, April 06, 2020 "
Bigly fake news!
"As an FYI the Trump campaign has been placing large food orders in many cities at locally owned restaurants and donating the food to hospitals, first responders in the area. That was leaked out about a week ago. I have no idea what the status of food is at the Trump Vegas, if it wasn't donated it could be that it is being kept on hand for the people who live permanently in the condos there."
"The Trump Hotel doesn’t have nearly as many food options as the major resorts on the Strip. It makes sense to read about MGM donating food when you think of the sheer volume of stuff they would have on hand. Trump Hotel? Not so much. The only place on the Strip that I’ve heard of that’s housing anyone for free is Polo Towers.Well, actually one of the time share companies that so many of us are usually quick to criticize...https://www.ktnv.com/news/coronavirus/diamon…Edited: 11:12 am, April 06, 2020 "
"There is only one restaurant at Trump LV. The poolside dining is seasonal.Of course, there is no casino. But, the very real possibility that they didn't have a huge inventory of food like a lot of the casino/resort/hotels, may mean that there wasn't much to give away.Sure, I'm guessing as much as everyone else is. But just sayin'"

“ doesn't one of his ex-wives actually own that hotel?“Nope:https:/…Trump_International_Hotel_Las_Vegas
Does anyone know what percentage of the restaurants in the MGM properties MGM Resorts actually owns? They can't donate the food if they don't own it. Any more than a landlord of any restaurant in any other location.
It was posted on Facebook so there's your answer.
It is the perfect hotel.
"You can buy condos at Trump, it is not owned by Trump organizations. I have looked at it in 2009 and again last year, prices are okay but HOA is too high. Trump Hotel will rent out your condo for you. All hotels everywhere have no business, biggest hotel business now is renting rooms to governments to house workers, homeless and quarantined people, not sick patients. California rents over 7000 hotel rooms. They are not donating rooms, they contract rooms to governments, good business, better than no business. Hotels are in trouble, in no position to donate, government rent saves hotels."
"""all of the las vegas hotels have donated food & had their rooms used for emergency personnel..."" ""all""? Right. Of course this is just another fake news post and an obvious attempt to find fault, criticize, and divide. . This is not the time. Nice try."
"There are 23 units for sale at Trump Hotel, low side is $228,000, 533 square feet. Standard hotel studio suite, room 2317. HOA $560. Price was about $100,000 less during 2008 crisis. Generally hotels do not own the real estate, all major chains are hotel operators leasing properties from building owners."
"$128,000 for a condo at Trump Vegas would be a steal. I'd buy it immediately. Great investment piece. Considering the economic outlook, might hit below 2008 levels."

"No, it is not ok to say that ,,lol"
#20...absolutely OK to say you support whoever the President is in their efforts to help Americans. But don’t you dare ask about Vegas travel!
"Back to buying a Trump Hotel room, $228,000, 533 square feet. Standard hotel studio suite, room 2317. HOA $560. You can buy a single home house in Las Vegas for that price. Older houses in Paradise 1-2 blocks behind east of the Strip casinos in Paradise area. No HOA payment. You can see Trump Hotel from your house. Paradise has the highest crime rate, I guess mostly from the casino areas. Not a good area but you don’t need to deal with the Trumps. Or on the west side, 5 minutes from the Strip, 2 bedroom condos about $150,000. But I was tempted. Every time I drove pass it I wish I bought a 1-2 bedroom unit in it 10 years ago. Palm condos are in similar price range, but with exceptional trendy pools, pools on the balconies too. BTW, Trump Tower apartments NYC, 1700 square feet about $1.7 million. Once he is out, dump trucks up front will clear out, great location. Hurry."

"Bill Gates gave $37b to charity in 2019. Trump, the philanthropist... 0?"
"Aside from Polo, no Strip resorts, and I am being generous including it in that category, are providing rooms. One, that is a logistical and security nightmare. Two for most properties it doesn't make sense since the rooms have no kitchens (yes I know Trump does). Three, Vegas is compact with a great freeway system. It isn't like the hospitals are right on The Strip or the city is huge. Why is this even needed? These first responders are still getting paid and have homes. It isn't like NYC where most people don't have cars and EMS or hospital personnel have to travel a long distance on filthy subways."
Bill Gates is also on point for depopulating the planet—especially sub-Sahara Africa. I’ve never heard Trump say “Let’s get rid of black people.”
"It is true and recently reported by a local newspaper in Las Vegas. The same goes for all of his hotels. The taxpayers help keep them all afloat too. NOT ONE DIME in donations. Keep in mind that just about all of his businesses have been shuttered as a result of all that is going on. You now know why he got rid of the IG overseeing the millions to help businesses and people during the pandemic. He will use for his businesses.Edited: 10:17 pm, April 09, 2020 "
BB: One half of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation spending goes to Africa. The funds they put into the foundation and philanthropist Warren Buffett amount to more than than $50bn.
"DTC....it is OK if you hate the President, that is your choice as an American. But at least be truthful in your posts.... first Trump did donate to charity in 2019. And in terms of Gates, even Gates did not donate $37b to charity in 2019. He has pledged/donated cumulatively over the years over $37b though, so credit to him for his charity."
DTC is still mad because Key West is better. Poor guy stuck in the ghetto of Naples. Is Naples the Circus Circus of Florida buddy?

"@Renee, Thanks! Is that like checking out of Circus Circus and moving over to the Wild Wild West?"
"Yes, DTC, you are correct. Gates is doing a bang-up job in Africa. Just like that guy in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s had a thriving enterprise putting people in camps to get rid of them. With his push for crazy vaccines, Gates would have fit right in—easily a general in the Human Experiments Section."

Funny how all these 1 post wonders just popped out of nowhere. I'm just curious why a first responder needs a free hotel room in Vegas at the moment? Legit question.
...to make sure they can keep distance from their families who may have high risks at home.
This article confirms that hotels are donating tools and food to emergency personnel but does not mention Trump resorts for either positive or negative response to the situation. https:/…
Daily Kos says it is.*https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/4/5/19…
https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-con…It’s True but he does qualify for a bail out from this new bill!
The NYT reported a couple of weeks ago that several NYC hotels - including The Four Seasons - were opening up rooms to fire dept and hospital personnel.
https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2020/4/5/1934…
"Thousands of hotels across the country have donated rooms; a movement by Hospitality for Hope. It’s pretty awesome actually, what they’ve done. You should check it out!"
It is true according to an article in Daily Kos. I tried posting the link but it won’t download for some reason.
That's why the person that wrote this is asking. Duh!
https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/09/tru…
Actually there are several stories about hotels opening their doors to emergency personnel. It allows them to continue working without putting their familys at risk when they go home. They get to stay free of charge. Several hotels have reported doing it....no reports of Trump hotel doing it though.
"According to news reports, hotels are NOT donating the rooms, they contract with local governments to house emergency workers and quarantine travelers or homeless people. They get paid by the governments. These are widely reported in the news. 2 folds, this helps the hotels as all hotels have no business. 2- provide needed housing. Not donating the rooms. Reported by multiple news networks, hotels get paid. State of California contracted 8,000 hotel rooms, City of San Francisco also tented thoussbds if hotel rooms on its own, Trump hotel doesn’t own most of the rooms, Hilton hotels bought 200 rooms in Trump Hotel, many rooms and suites are owned by individual investors."
Sisolak should seize it by public domain and use it to house homeless.
">>>Sisolak should seize it by public domain and use it to house homeless.<<<Good luck with that. The homeless are being taking care of in the normal facilities, if they want help. Many do not. They have constructed a facility at Cashman Field to help the homeless. There are many organizations in the Las Vegas Valley that help the homeless everyday. One of the largest is Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada, that has reopened."
Was this tread linked to some left wing web site? Many single posts.
No doubt it is deliberately linked. President Trump and Jared are doing a wonderful job.
#117 I was just thinking the same thing. It’s very odd that people would open a TripAdvisor account just to share political propaganda. I hope they realize this is a travel forum and no one care’s about their political views.
Remember Trump does not own this hotel with his name.Business
"This thread has some interesting responses for sure. Lots of first time posters. It’s going to great, magnificent, nothing ever like it. Yuge."

Doesn't matter the type of forum, it's the mention of a word, name or phrase. I say hats off the LV organizations who did donate. And I hope I'll be visiting again this year."
"Apparently, people do care. And if we want to stay on topic, I stayed at the Trump Hotel in Vegas in 2015 and it was the most tacky and gaudy hotel I'd ever been in.We've stayed in much nicer hotels, but if I had to sum up the Trump Hotel, it'd be ""gold spray paint"""
"""President Trump and Jared are doing a wonderful job...."" ..using their positions to line their pockets."
"#124... you must have been absolutely shocked to find something “tacky and gaudy” in Las Vegas! This must be why Trump hotel is only ranked #7 out of 273 hotels in Las Vegas. Thank you for taking the time to create a profile just to share this information. For future reference, you can post hotel reviews."
"Hahaha..they'll even defend a hotel with his name. Here's something for you: Trump brought some goats to his golf course in NJ and was able to pay only 1/80 of the taxes on that property using a tax benefit intended to help farmers. Back to travel..
