"In reading a few of the most recent Topic responses, it appears the area is not under any Covid-19 restrictions?? Am I right or wrong? Thanks"
"You are wrong. Florida is in Phase 2 and still has plenty of restrictions. Look it up before you go. Social distancing is still in effect. There are still restrictions on restaurants, and a limit of 10 in a group of people. Indoor seating at restaurants and bars is fifty percent usual capacity. Restaurants can allow higher capacity outside as long as the tables allow six feet between diners. We just did our first escape from Fort Myers in five months in our RV to the St Pete Beach area and to Anna Maria Island. All of the beaches we've been to require social distancing on the beach, and in any parks located next to the beach. We have seen the Sheriff's jeep patrolling. In the morning, it's easy to socially distance as required by the beach rules. In the afternoon, it's not. There are still restaurants that are closed, and others that allow no indoor seating and have their bars closed. Some businesses don't feel safe allowing what the state allows. There are also many parks and attractions that haven't reopened. If you do decide to go to Destin, and go to the grocery store, Publix requires social distancing . The aisles are all one way. Look at the floor and you will see an arrow or an X. The arrow means you can enter that aisle. An X means you can't and you have to go to the next aisle. It makes it much easier to follow the flow, especially in a store you're not familiar with."
"Wow, I guess I had a very different experience when we were in FL last week. Granted, we were on AMI but we had no issues at grocery stores requiring we go ""one way"" down an aisle. Only the employees were wearing masks. We went out to dinner several times and there were plenty of people, very few wearing masks. The beaches were full and nobody worried about social distancing. The people on the island were thrilled to have visitors back!"
"And when the ""safe at home"" protocol is put back in place, travel bans are reinstated, and businesses forced to close, we'll know who to blame. There are metrics set up, that when exceeded, cause restrictions to be put back into place. I don't want to go backward because people from other states don't want to practice social distancing while on vacation. If you went to Publix on AMI, the aisles are marked as ""one way"", as they are in all Publix stores in Florida. It's their policy. On AMI, the Baywalk at Leffis Preserve is closed due to Covid19. The visitor center is closed at DeSoto Memorial Park. The inside dining room at the Beach House is closed until at least July, and no one is allowed to sit at the bar. Patio dining is available with widely spaced tables, and they have social distancing lines on the walkway to the entrance, all the way to the host station (which has a large bottle of hand sanitizer for customer use). We had lunch there twice and all employees had masks. We always carry masks with us since there are stores that require them. BJ's and Best Buy were 2 that we encountered within the last week.The public entrances to the beaches on AMI all have signs saying that social distancing is required, Family groups of less than 10 are allowed to be together, but if you didn't give strangers six feet at the beach, I'm sure you got some dirty looks that you didn't notice. Since there's so little beach parking available on AMI, the beaches have enough room to allow for social distancing."
"Whatever Florida did, didn't work well.https:/…"
"Every Publix in Florida has the same one way flow. Some of the smaller stores have only one door you can use to enter or exit the store.The mask thing is a preference. Some communities use them more than others, and PLEASE, nobody start a fight on this issue again.Stage 2 rules are plastered all over the internet. A simple Google search will give you more specifics."
Where I live we have signs requesting that visitors wear masks and practice social distancing to protect our elderly population and workers. Sadly it is being largely ignored by tourists. Even in phase one a local restaurant opened with zero precautions. I have not been to Destin in several months so cannot answer specific to that area. It’s up to you to decide if you want to be part of the problem or part of the solution.
"We've figured out, we're all on our own. Either you realize there's a pandemic and you take measures to protect yourself, or you don't. You see the same behaviors everywhere in our country and as many of these regulations are actually suggestions, as there's rarely a way to enforce them, use your own common sense. Where people are more lax, Covid is surging. I live in a state which has a lower rate than most, but we are now seeing daily increases."
Shopping at Publix is reasonably organized one way until-------you hit the produce section. Then all bets are off and it's every man for himself. All I need is a zucchini but it is total chaos in the squash section and I can't get close with all the misdirected shoppers!
"Point to the security camera on the ceiling, yell “Clean-up in aisle six”, point in that general direction, then get that zucchini, damn the arrows on the floor."
"Restrictions still exist, but compliance is somewhat minimal along the panhandle coast."
"I know exactly what you mean JoeM. I planned to buy the 24 oz wrapped zucchini pack that was on sale today. But there were already 2 people closely examining them (by lifting them up to their faces for a close look), and another person who gave me a close pass to beat me to the zucchini. I ended up with some less popular poblano peppers (our favorites despite being so overpriced at Publix), some turnips, a hothouse cucumber and a bag of spinach. In our local store, It was very easy to get to the fresh berries that were also on sale.I actually had the biggest problem this morning at Publix with a vendor in the bread aisle. He had no mask, and wouldn't let me by his bread cart without walking within a foot of him. I think the outside vendors need to be held to the same standards as the employee. I think I'll give that as feedback to Publix."
"We just returned from the Sandestin /Santa Rosa Beach area. We were shocked at the lack of social distancing, maybe 2% of people wore masks. Restaurants were packed. Beaches were packed. We drove through Seaside and Rosemary Beach--packed--all restaurants and shops. Publix was the most of social distancing that we saw. We were very surprised at the waitstaffs in restaurants not wearing masks or gloves in many instances. It was very eye opening"
That is probably why the virus has skyrocketed in recent days in Florida. Does not look too promising.
"We are under restrictions but people do not seem to be following them. Went to Publix this am and about 30% were wearing masks. (me included). Restaurants do not seem to be following the 50% rules on inside seating. I suggest going in off hours or takeout.Edited: 3:03 pm, June 16, 2020 "
The governor stubborn in accepting the huge spike in the virus. Politics before safety.

#16 tell that to the peoples families who have died from the virus. Especially surprising to see a comment like that from someone from hard hit NYC.
"Here in NYC, I would say that about 20% of the people you see walking around don't have masks visible, but about a third of the rest have the masks down around their necks instead of covering their faces. And a lot of people walk around with the masks covering their mouths and with their noses peeking out over the top."
Social distancing rules are for fools.What an idiotic and selfish statement.
"We recently returned from Seaside. We visited many places from Blue Mountain Beach to Inlet Beach. I don’t know what the official rules are, but no one was social distancing. Maybe 2-3 stores required masks for entry. In general, people were not wearing masks, stores, beaches, restaurants, and streets were all packed. We ate either at home or at restaurant patios with spaced tables. Publix did try to have (but did not enforce) social distancing rules, and people thanked us for wearing masks."
"I have been in Fort Walton Beach since June 5th visiting my daughter and grandson I totally agree with your post. I was shocked to see how few people wear mask in stores. Only a few of the restaurants have employees wearing mask. When we go out to eat we go at off peak times and eat outside. We go to the beach early, around 8:00 and leave by 10 or 11. We also spread out our chairs, towels etc to allow at least 6 feet between us and our nearest neighbor. We are taking precautions and hope others will be considerate."
"Please explain the science behind the mask especially in outdoors on open waters or sand?What % of people wear correctly, not touching them with hands, how porous they are? I’m confused.Any explanations or info from this area on prevention and proper wearing of masks?If my server keeps touching it and adjusting on their face, should I provide them with another one or ask them not to serve me?"
Mask usage from the Mayo clinic. https:/…art-20485449
Without protective precautions Florida virus has record increase.https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-shatters-…
Not a good time to vacation in Florida until this problem is under control.
"Yeah, I'm not even sure they'll make it through the tourist season without shutting it back down again at this point. If they are open in September though, I'm going. This whole thing has turned my world upside down for a couple of months, and there's no way I'm not going to visit my favorite place on the planet this year. I don't even care if I am confined to sitting on my balcony looking at the ocean for a week."
"My stance has always been, I can only control what I control. We wear masks, stay socially distant and wash hands, use hand sanitizer. We can't do anything about other people.I'm in WI and in some areas these rules are followed, in others, not at all. No matter what, we assume anywhere we go, any contact we have that person may be a carrier. My husband's workplace requires masks of everyone. An employee had covid, but no-one else tested positive. They're not magic, but many studies show it reduces the spread. So, I ignore the mistakes others do, stay away from them and those places and go where I can tell they put my safety first. THAT'S where I spend my money. It's also why we cancelled our 3 weeks in Destin back in mid-March. I expected FL and many visitors to react this way."
"I'm with you Roger C! Well, kind of.I cannot stand the thought of not visiting my favorite place on the planet either....Things are not however, where I thought they would be regarding this virus, and considering how long it's been here already.My mental status needs a trip to Destin, in the worst of ways...lol! What about the ""theory"" once it got warmer, the virus would lessen? You know, that does happen with the flu....just another weird thing about this virus that sets it apart from the others, with constant unpredictability regarding age groups, intubation period, masks, etc. One day you see on the news a 94 year old man recovers.....later that same day you see on that same news channel a 25 year old healthy soccer player from New Jersey died from it. Such insanity like nothing I've witnessed in my lifetime. All things considered, I just keep waiting....hoping for a miracle and really want things to be better in September but if they're not, I'm most likely staying put. :-("
"And suddenly, Florida is the new epicenter for the virus..."
"Gee, how on earth did that happen? Inquiring minds want to know..."
"Beats me Frozen, a real 'head scratcher"" for sure! :-O"
"I did hear on the news this morning though, that people from my state can't travel to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, or Kansas without the 14 day quarantine coming into play, so I guess we aren't doing that much better."
If you're coming to Destin just pick up a 7' double gripped distancing bamboo stick. It keeps you safely distanced.
"JoeMammy,Where can I buy one of those? Souvenir shop? :-)"
