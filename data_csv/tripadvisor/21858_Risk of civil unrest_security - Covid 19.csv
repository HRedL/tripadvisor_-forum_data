Can I get thoughts on potential civil unrest and security issues on the island when COVID 19 takes a grip? I'm a female expat living here alone and concerned around supply chain and the slowness in response by the government and general complacency but and breakdown in civil decency but leaving to go home.
Why would there be civil unrest? I know many items will be in short supply or not available even but if you’ve lived there for a while you must know your way around so you can shop in a variety of places.
"I am assuming you are here on the Island as am I . Why ever do you feel like that ? If you think Barbados is the sort of country where your fears might come true , why ever did you choose to live here ? I have always felt safer in Barbados then in the U.K. and despite the virus , or because of the virus , still do .  Where do you live that makes you feel so unsafe ?Edited: 5:53 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Probably a lot better there than it is in the UK.....selfish people panic buying anything that has a shelf life, fights in supermarkets over items etc...nightmare"
"‘but leaving to go home’ ? So are you worried about Barbados or your home, wherever that may be?"
"This poster seems to ask questions but not bother to come back, or at least reply, to the answers."
Where is the vid?
I have received several on What’s App NC I’m not sure how I can post them on here .
"Can you send by email? I have just read London may go into lockdown because initial gov't strategy has not worked. Troops being prepared. This is reported by the Mirror, not sure if it is reliable."
Lol is the Mirror reliable?
"NC, what you hear is correct, 40 underground stations are to close in London, 20,000 troops are being placed on a state of readiness to assist in the running of the capital. This is just the tip of the iceberg I think."
London is apparently approx 5 days ahead of the rest of the UK as far as the virus is concerned according to Boris on his now daily TV update yesterday. People in London would seem to be going about as if nothing is wrong. (Obviously not everyone) I haven’t seen any fisty-cuffs or scuffles in supermarkets here so it must be elsewhere in the country. Shelves are empty of a lot of goods though. I do know people who either have the virus or are self isolating though.
Thanks Westie. I must say it looks more like Walmart on black Friday in the US. LolSo what the Mirror had reported is true then JGD.
Just had an email saying Clark’s shoe shops are closing all of the UK stores. There may be some franchise places still open.
"There are unspeakable acts of selfishness in stockpiling from supermarkets and also wonderful offers of help from the majority of generous and kind folks in the UK. Don’t suppose you can access the BBC News website but please don’t believe the tabloid newspaper headlines.The London Underground is closing some stations and reducing services because most people are staying at home as they have been advised .Edited: 7:48 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Civil Unrest ... why should this happen ..... given the general nature of the Bajan people - I would say it is most unlikely .... in France maybe .... but not BarbadosIf it does happen in Barbados or any other country for that matter ... it is more than likely because the idea has been muted by the press and certain commentators in particular NC - yes there is 'talk' that London ( which is as expected the centre of the outbreak in the UK) will be put in lockdownI suppose the Government is struggling with the practicalities of how this will be done, precisely which parts will be restricted and most importantly how it will be policed10 years of austerity have reduced our police force to a bare minimum - so there is also 'talk' that the military will be brought in to support the police IMHO this is about 2 - 3 weeks too late ...if it had been done earlier then the number of cases would PROBABLY be on the decline"
"The UK strategy has failed and your gov't will have to answer for it. It is as if different countries are trying different strategies to see which works best. Of course the lack of an American strategy, and Trump's lack of understanding of the situation in the early days has not helped the US either."
"Certainly not seen any signs of civil unrest where I am in the UK. Yes, some of the shops are pretty depleted, but they seem to be getting regular deliveries. Went to Marks yesterday - everyone was behaving in a civilized manner! Ocado booking time is now 3 weeks, but I've managed to get most of what I want - including toilet paper!!Some younger people are still hanging out in pubs and clubs in London, so I think this is why these measures will be necessary. My son is now working from home as are a lot of people who commute into London. We certainly don't want to go on the tube at the moment. Numbers are bad in London, but outside (especially up North) things appear to be much less so.Let's hope numbers in Barbados don't grow like they are here. I see people are already stocking up at Massys, so some obviously have a similar view on the need to stockpile as some people here. The supermarkets would be wise to limit sales of certain items now, to stop this becoming a problem.I am sure the people of Barbados will listen to their Government and be sensible in these difficult times. Unfortunately, inevitably people will be temporarily laid off from employment, but hopefully the Government will assist them with national insurance payments etc. Let's just hope this doesn't go on for too long. Good news from China today - no more new cases!"
Why has the UK strategy failed??
"I have a son , daughter in law and several nephews who live in London and are reporting that many of their friends are looking to leave London ASAP !!!Some friends are discussing taking their camper van and going 'wild camping' in rural Wales or Scotland !!On a positive note .... there are many good things happening .. The National Trust has withdrawn all charges to the outdoor areas of their properties ...we are off to get lost in the maze at Cliveden"
"I can't even with this.. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.. i'm addressing the original poster and have not even read the rest of the posts..please.. get on a plane and leave. in my 27 years on this island, there has NEVER been a case of civil unrest.. .. we haven't run out of food, and not likely too.. we are a civil society. .. Please Please stop.. back your bags and go.. we don't need this kind of talk or person living in Barbados..."
"Well said Sunny . I could not agree more. However, this person seems to habitually post things on here and then does not acknowledge any advise given.Edited: 8:52 am, March 19, 2020 "
Personally I think the Chinese and Italian actions failed. They seem to have a handle on it now but had China dealt with it and been honest it ‘maybe’ wouldn’t have been so bad. Just saying........
How true Jackiee
"Sunnie ... brilliant response ...well said ...absolutely no need for this type of talk """"""Why has the UK strategy failed??""""""There is no simple single answer to this question ...but for what it is worth IMHO ...They were far too slow to react with certain measures. However in certain areas they were restricted as to what they could doTotal failure to introduce mass testing ..which many experts ( inc the WHO) say is an essential in having factual evidence ( rather than computer models ) about how the virus is spreadingAfter 10 years of austerity the Government knew at a VERY early stage that the NHS was totally unprepared on many fronts to cope with the virus. They have listen far too much to 'experts' who are remote from the NHS - rather than the actual medical practitioners who work in the NHSThey probably were aware of the real situation .... in which case they lied to us all about why and when they were taking actionWe are short of beds , equipment, protective clothing and personnel. If they had reacted 3/4 weeks go when it was clear that this would be a world wide problem ...we would not be in such a poor position as we are are todayIn my close family I have a GP and a NHS Consultant - this is how they actually find things In a table of 15 OECD countries showing the number of critical care beds / 1000 people ...the UK was bottom of the list - below Italy and Spain !!!IMO ... virtually everything the Government has done over the past month has been to delay the strain on the NHSUnfortunately, as was inevitable, ...the spread of the virus has overtaken their attempts to prepareOn the simple matter of getting in extra supplies of oxygen - they have failed ...plenty at BOC but not in the hospitalsThis whole nonsense on herd immunity mentioned by the Government 'experts' was a distraction and certainly fake information. A basic requirement of creating herd immunity is an effective vaccine together with a certainty that having had the virus creates immunity. neither are applicable to Covid 19. It took outraged medical practitioners to stop mention of this More and more the doctors / nurses etc - actually on the front line are sparking up as to how unprepared the NHS isWe should have gone in for far more stringent social isolation at a a much earlier stage We should have been far more restrictive regarding visitors coming into the UK and doing basic tests ( if we had ordered the kits !!)Loads of other actions could have happened sooner .... rant over !!!Edited: 4:32 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Here is some reading to help Mdp's argument.https:/…https:/…index.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…In a nutshell Johnson was letting 60% o the people get covid and isolating and protecting the vulnerable in hopes of attaining herd immunity. Problem is there is no vaccine yet, young people are not always survivors and they don't know how long immunity lasts after infection if there is an immunity. Bad plan..."
Wow a bit harsh on the OP.... she might be new to the island... new to being an expat fullstop and has stated she is on her own....
"She was asking about the potential for issues, not what was happening right now.... we don't know her circumstances, so I don't understand the aggressive tone."
Sunshine Mdp and myself tried to explain but TA didn't like the answers.Here is some reading for you:https:/…https:/…index.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…
"MDP - your mention of someone thinking of wild camping sent shivers down my spine. On our tiny little island in the Outer Hebrides our doctors and other healthcare professionals have put an excellent package of measures together in case we do get the virus on our island. Despite the majority of us earning in some way from tourism, we are all hoping for a lockdown. There are rumours that our ferry will become freight only with exceptions for medical appointments etc on the mainland. We are dreading an influx of people looking for a “safe” place in motor homes. They don’t realise how much pressure they would potentially put on our healthcare services and bring the risk of infection to many vulnerable people. We can all decline and cancel any accommodation bookings in our holiday lets,hotels and campsites, but we can’t control vehicles coming over. Yes, this is off the Barbados topic and clearly sounds selfish, but it proves that people are scared the world over and we need to think what the consequences of our actions are on others. God bless us all."
"Bank of England cuts interest rate for second time in a week to the lowest level seen since 1694.UK economy in free fall, facing a very uncertain future,what hope has Barbados got without tourism in the short term,unless Mia imposes a further raft of draconian tax rises to arrest the forthcoming slump ??"
Yes I understand your concerns Mrs MAC. We live in the Scottish Borders and I was hoping MDP’s friends were joking.
I dont see how Barbados will be able to survive this thousands of workers are already unemployed in Barbados from this week.

"Alex, wow that happened quickly, which sector has been shedding staff?"
"JGDerYakSame as in UK and Europe. Staff in bars, restaurants, hotels, tour guides, retail, gyms etc. Because all these places are having to close. The people who don’t earn the most but are the real people that keep the economy working. Not Boris and his chums who don’t give a F. They will be fine. X"

NC ... thanks for posting those links ... glad I am not the only one to think that way
"No problem Mdp. I see TA has re-posted our posts. The mods must get tired of ""the community"" causing posts to be deleted without cause. Just makes extra work for them."
