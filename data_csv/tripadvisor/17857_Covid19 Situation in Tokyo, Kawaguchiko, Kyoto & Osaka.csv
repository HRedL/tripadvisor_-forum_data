"Hi everyone, im very anxious with the recent news about the virus situation in Japan now. And yesterday, our Ministry of Health just announced taht one citizen from my country got infected after coming back from Japan.Im going to travel from 6th April-18th April with my husband & 3yo toddler. Im gonna commute using public transport since this is budget trip. Im very worried for my toddler. As for us, we thinks we are independant enough to take care of ourself & the hygiene precaution. Im starting to train my son to wear mask, it seems a failure to date. Any word of advice or comfort about the situation there for a toddler?Thank you."
