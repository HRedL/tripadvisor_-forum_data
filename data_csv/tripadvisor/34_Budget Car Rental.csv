"I have recently returned from a holiday in Florida where I rental a car from Budget. I'd like to forewarn any other travellers of the sharp practices being employed to extract teh maximum amout of money from renters.Following a 14 hour journey we arrived at the Budget rental Desk in Tampa. We still had to drive to Orlando so were keen to get on our way. The lady was very helpful and completed all the paperwork only pausing to ask me what I drove in the UK, probable in the hope of upgrading me. She then said, initial here, here and sign here. I made the error of not checking in my rush and off we went. During the holiday we used a toll road. I pulled off the road to pay the toll only to be told it had been paid automatically. It seems the car was fitted with EZ pay and this was left on. Whether this is by default of not I don't know. When I got my reciept out I discovered that using the EZ pay system even once results in a £2.95 ""convenience fee"" payable for the entire duration of the rental! That first toll had cost me over $40!While I was going over teh reciept I also notice I'd been charged $167 dollars for additional sickness insurances, something already covered by my travle insurance. Next to these charges was teh work ""accepted"" and this was one of the area I'd initialed. HAving had a less than satisfactory reply from Budget I just want to warn fellow travellers of this sharp practice and tell them always, always check what you;re signing. I've hired cars tens of times before and teh agents has always offered these add ons and I've always rejected them. This time I was stupid and trusting, it won't happen again."
"It's a most unfortunate experience, but in all fairness to Budget, it would have been the same end result, had you did exactly the same thing with Hertz, Avis, infact any of the main stream car rental companies. One situation with one agent at the desk isn't a particularly comprehensive reflection on an entire rental company. They are one of the biggest in their industry, and had this been a common type of practice throughout their existence, I doubt they would have lasted this long. You added that the lady was indeed helpful, and I find it difficult to believe that they are trained deliberately to mislead you into purchasing add ons.When you stated that you've hired cars ""tens of times"", were any with Budget? If do, what were your previous experiences?Best putting it down to experience, and a learning lesson - not about Budget, but about signing contracts without reading the T&C thoroughly."
"There are many reports on the Florida and other destination forums about the deceptive practices of agents of car rental companies. It appears these agents must get paid some sort of commission for selling upgrades. It is not limited to Budget. Many other car rental companies are doing the same thing.The ""cashless toll"" issue is a big thing in Florida. There is also lots of discussion about it on the Florida destination forums. I think it's crazy that they charge a toll, then don't give you an easy option to pay for it. Residents who use the system regularly get a transponder that automatically deducts the toll from their account, but with all the tourism in Florida it's crazy not to have a painless way for visitors to pay tolls.I was fortunate enough to have read these reports before my recent trip to Tampa. So, I looked over my contract with Dollar car rental very closely. Everything was okay in my case, but I matched the total with the amount shown on my reservation to make sure nothing was added.These scams seem to take many forms. And yes I will use that word because I've read enough reports to believe the word fits in this case. It's true customers need to read what they are signing, but there's no doubt in my mind there are deceptive practices being employed to trick the customer."

"I've hired cars from most of the major players, Hertz, Dollar etc and in different countries. In all cases options were offered to me, not added indiscriminately. I honestly believe these agenat have targets to meet, (don't we all?) and one of the ways they do that is through deception. Maybe I'm a bit more cynical than you :-)I will definately be using it as a $200 learning experience!"
"One thing I do to minimize potential problems is join the rental company's free club. I did this with Dollar on my recent trip. I was able to input all my credit card and drivers license info online before my trip. Being a club member I was able to go directly to the garage to pick up my car thereby avoiding the agents. The attendant in the garage asked to see my license and credit card and printed out my contract. I looked it over and verified the charges and it clearly stated on my copy that I had declined insurance and declined paying for a tank of gas, which is another rip off upsell.I think taking a minute to review the contract is the key although I have read about some pretty clever schemes by agents. One involved a guy who had insurance coverage under his credit card benefits. The agent ran the card and said it was declined and they can't run it thru again for 24 hours. He had the customer use a different card and then sold him insurance because insurance was not covered on the secondary card. Now I would have put up a fuss about it, but who knows how it would be resolved in the heat of the moment.Since this is the bargain travel forum I will also add that if you join Alamo's Insiders club you will get a discount on every car rental and the discount applies on top of any coupons or other special offers."
Why did the first toll cost you over $40?Budget does charge a daily fee plus tolls but there is a maximum charge of $14.95 per month for the transponder use.You need to give accurate details if you want people to pay attention to your complaint. https:/…ezpass.html
I'm sorry hawkeye if I didn't fully research the charges. I simply went on what it said on my contract and what I was told by Budget $2.95 for each day of the rental. No where on the documentation I had was there mention of a maximum charge. I'd suggest being in full possesion of the facts before jumping to conclusions.
The facts are there is a maximum charge of $14.95Your contract or documentation would not have a $40 charge for the first toll. Did you just guess this amount?
"14x $2.95, not a guess, a calculation. The email I had said ""you wil be charged $2.95 for each day of the rental. A more polite and helpful reply to my e mail would have been, "" good news, there is a limit on the amount they charge"" . Don't you just hate aggresive forum post ;-)"
Geez Hawkeye take a deep breath. The OP has raised some valid issues about pitfalls to watch out for when renting a car. So he missed the piece about the maximum charge. I agree with him that your reply could have been helpful instead of an attack.I hope other people will read this post and be better prepared to deal with these unscrupulous practices by car rental companies. Did you read the part of the original post where they snuck in $167 worth of unnecessary insurance charges?
"It wasn't an attack. I hate to see inaccuarte information posted.<<<<<Did you read the part of the original post where they snuck in $167 worth of unnecessary insurance charges?Yea I see that happen alot. It's amazing how many people will sign a contract and not have any idea what they are getting or what they are paying. Most people blame it on the long flight. The car agents are to blame, yes. But, the consumer needs to accept some responsibility also. Read the contract! It's there. It's not hidden.We always blame the car agents. Maybe there was a misunderstanding? Maybe they talked insurance? It can't be the agents fault everytime."
"Okay, well then I will assume you are not attacking me either, even though it sounds a lot like you are."" It can't be the agents fault everytime "" Is it the customer's fault every time? I know you are on other forums too, so you must read all of the issues that come up with car rentals. Of course customers should take better care to read their contracts and understand the terms and conditions, but that shouldn't give car rental agents carte blanche to take advantage of customers. This is a larger issue than uninformed customers.By the way $40 or $14.95 either way I still think it's an exorbitant charge to pay a toll. Much of the blame goes to the State of Florida for setting up these cashless tolls.Edited: 7 years ago "
"I don't think $14.95 is exorbitant, przyk. It's a one time charge for use of the transponder. Tolls are additional. Depending on where you drive in Florida it could save alot of stops at toll booths. No, it's not the customers fault everytime either. Adding insurance may be a big probelm but it has an easy fix. People need to read the contract before signing. It's very simple really."
"My days of using Budget are over. Recently rented a car from Syracuse ,NY. First there was a small dent on the passenger side but no one around to report it to, so I took a picture with a time stamp on my phone. I was also asked if I wanted to bring the car back empty but opted to fill it on my return....there are plenty of gas stations near by and I knew I would not use a full tank on 5 day trip. When I returned the car first someone questioned me about the ding in the car and acted like I did...Once I got that resolved they charged me for less than a gallon of gas at $8.50....I had filled up right before bringing the car in but was told the computer chip read it was below the amount I left with....In other words they topped off the tank before I left and there was no way I could fill it up that much. I have no idea if other companies are doing this but it is truly a rip off....If they wanted to charge me the going rate for gas I might not have been so upset....but 9 dollars a gallon is just wrong...So......no more Budget for me...."
"<I had filled up right before bringing the car in but was told the computer chip read it was below the amount I left with....In other words they topped off the tank before I left and there was no way I could fill it up that much. I have no idea if other companies are doing this but it is truly a rip off....>Whenever I leave the lot of ANY car rental place in ANY airport, I check the fuel gauge to make sure it is FULL. Not ""almost full"", but FULL. If there is a discrepancy, I deal with it at checkout. Bringing the car back, this information, I believe, is a visual check of the gauge by the check-in agent. I fail to see what the computer chip has to do with this. If you didn't bring the car back full, it was not full. This goes for any car rental company, which you may or may not be using in the future."
I filled the car up less than 10 miles from the airport...the gauge was above full when I returned it.
Then why not dispute it right then and there - walk into the kiosk or desk and tell them you filled up the car and show them your gas station receipt??
Because I needed to catch a flight.....I'm not sure why you are arguing with me about this...I have rented many a car in every part of the world and never had this problem before....I know the rules but must say I was blindsided with this new computer chip....I filled the car up to the top...but to have them charge $9.00 a gallon is outrageous...I was short less than one gallon....should I bring a gas can with me next time and fill up the last gallon when I return the car?
"<.....I'm not sure why you are arguing with me about this...>I'm not arguing with you, I'm trying to get clarification of the details of your situation so I can understand. In my many years of travel and car rentals (averaging 30 rentals a year), with ALL the majors, including Budget - I've never heard of a situation where a computer chip was pointed our to be the culprit. Your situation is brand new to me. Anyways, I'm renting a Budget car at Syracuse this weekend, and I'll be sure to pay attention to the check-in and checkout procedures, myself."
Well good luck...the car I had was a Chrysler 200.....I'll be interested to see how it works out for you....
"I wondered about that computer chip thing checking the gas level too. I've never heard of it. It sounds like an annoyance, but it seems to me $ 9 may not be worth losing sleep over. If it is important dispute the charge with your credit card company.I don't like the fact that I think there are more complaints about major rental car companies lately with bait and switch, upcharging etc. I know in the end it is my responsibility to verify the charges, but I think there are too many horror stories for them all to be false. There are even some class action suits filed over these dubious practices."
"Don't worry I did not lose sleep over it but I think of Trip Advisor as someplace to tell both the good and bad of travel....People need to be aware of these kind of ""scams"" although I am sure all the car companies will be doing it soon....but for now...Budget is out for me...."
"Well, I'm happy (for myself) to report that I did rent from this outlet (Avis and Budget do share check-in lanes) and I had no issues. I also was assigned a Chrysler 200. No issues at all this morning when I turned the car back in."
"So, just to be clear...you rented from budget...same car and it did not have the computer chip?"
"The guy scanned the car's bar code and visually checked the gas level, which was full. No mention of a chip or any device that would record from a chip. Yes, Budget."
That is so weird....maybe I was a test case? Guess in the big picture it does not matter...there are so many other rental companies and for now Budget will not be my choice...
"We just returned our budget rental car and were shocked at all the additional charges they put on our account, over 500 dollars additional. So far customer service has been terrible. Do not use!"
Why even bother to post if you are not going to include details?
"ApElkins......Shocked, huh? What were the charges for? Your post tells us nothing."
"No surprises here...yet another one and done post with no details. And a duplicate post, no less.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I recently rented a car using America Car Rentals who secured a car for us with BUDGET RENTALS at San Francisco Airport. At first I was forgiving when I had to stand at the service desk for an hour waiting for Budget to sort out their mess with our contract for a 42 day car rental. But now I am not so forgiving after my return to Australia I discovered a $1000+ withdrawal from my credit card account by Budget without notice. I was totally in shock and contacted America Car Rental who after 2 weeks working on my behalf finally got a refund but for only $893. Budget charged me the balance for gas, fees and taxes. Funny, I had prepaid for gas at San Francisco Airport when I picked the car up. I again contacted America Car Rental who again got another refund on my behalf but again it took weeks to get the money. Budget was asked to send me an itemised account but surprise, Budget did not contact me with the account nor did they apologise in any way for the whole mess and trauma they had put me through. If it wasn't for America Car Rentals I would have had to deal with Budget myself from half way around the world. That would have been fun! How dare Budget treat their customers in this way. Renters beware of this inefficient, incompetent and uncaring company."
"Did it occur to you that perhaps if you didn't go through a broker, none of this may have happened?"
"Budget admitted at the beginning that the contract was messed up by them. The overcharge at the end was also Budget's fault because they refunded 95% of the money. America Car Rentals were superb in their dealings and their prices are in my opinion unbeatable. If Budget were an efficient company this would never have happened. If you were overcharged by $1000+ I'm sure you would have expected an apology from such an incompetent company. By the way America Car Rentals did everything on my behalf and solved the problem. That's a lot of time, effort and trauma saved on my behalf."
"From reading these forums for a long time it seems that many foreign visitors to the US use third party agents to rent cars in the USA. This takes care of a lot of the problems with insurance and other issues, so it is very common and seems to work best in lots of circumstances. You are fortunate that you used a company that worked on your behalf to resolve your issues.One question I have is it is normal to get a receipt showing all the charges when you turn in a car. Did you not get a receipt showing the charges, or were these charges added on after you turned in the car and not included on the receipt you received?"
"America Car Rentals is based in England and I have used this company on numerous occasions without any trouble. Despite the fact that I live in Australia, I prefer dealing with this company as their rates are extremely competitive. For the 42 days car rental with all insurance included and unlimited mileage I paid $1500 ($35/day) for a Chevy Cruze automatic. The voucher specifically stated the number of days and the cost but Budget had it messed up and when I arrived at San Francisco they had a pre-written contract for 23 days for the same price. Budget admitted their mistake but it took them over 1 hour to draw up another contract. We have time stamps on our cameras to verify this. On our arrival we were given a receipt but no indication that we were to be charged an extra $1023. The money was deducted from our account on the same day as the return but we were told on pickup we had no more to pay. Thanks to America Car Rentals the whole episode was handled very satisfactorily on our behalf. I couldn't believe how fast they were at answering my emails. Just a matter of minutes. Budget were the ones taking forever to refund the money."
It probably made it easier for American Car rentals to resolve since the charges were made after you turned the car in and were not included on your receipt. If I had rented direct from Budget and they didn't resolve it I would have contested the charge with my credit card company.
They SUCK!! Don't ever rent from them!!! They charged me twice for a car I rented and then tell me it will take up to 7 days to get a refund! In the mean time I have bounced check charges and am in the negative and can't buy groceries tonight for my kids!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE AND WORST PLACE TO RENT A CAR EVER!!YOU SUCK BUDGET!!!!
^^^^ Reported as spam....seriously?
"Worst rental car experience ever! I will NEVER rent from Budget again. Only one attendant at the counter. Waited in line almost an hour. They were completely out of cars (there were 3 of us with reservations who's cars were not there). They had to borrow cars from another company. They ""upgraded"" me to a different car, which was fine, except there was severe damage to the rear bumper. There was no one available to come look at the car and they did not give me a damage form. It was late, dark and a long walk from the parking garage back to the counter with tons of luggage and two very tired kids. I assumed that the damage was noted and made the mistake of taking the car anyway. When I went to return the car, the attendant jumped up and immediately went to the back of the car (she had been sitting at the desk in front of where I parked, so she could not see the back of the car when I pulled in). By the time I got out of the driver's seat she was at my door saying ""I see we had a fender bender."" I DID NOT have any type of fender bender. She was referring to the damage that was there when I picked up the car. I told them exactly what happened at pickup and they were VERY rude. Her manager came over and said ""We would never rent a car in this condition."" Well, they did. I am in the middle of fighting with them right now over this. I think they have some sort of scam going. The money I saved by renting from them was NOT worth this headache. We have rented a lot of cars in the past and have never had an experience as terrible as this one. DO NOT RENT FROM BUDGET EVER!!!!!! And yes, I realize that it was a HUGE mistake on my part to leave without insisting that the person at the counter give me something in writing about the condition of the car. I should not have believed her when she said it was noted, and I definitely learned my lesson."
"<And yes, I realize that it was a HUGE mistake on my part to leave without insisting that the person at the counter give me something in writing about the condition of the car. >But, even though you realized it was a HUGE mistake, you still did it - and this was the personal decision which started the whole chain of events. I rent a lot of cars. I would never have left before confirming it was fully noted in the record. In fact, I would have waited in line, called corporate, if needed - taken phone pics with time logs - whatever it took. So, because of your decision, it's Budget's fault and they purposely wreck cars and rent them to others, in order to collect damages (I'm guessing that's what you mean when you say ""scam"")?"
"That's a tough situation when you arrive late have to wait in line a long time have a couple of kids and lots of luggage in tow, but the bottom line is you learned an expensive lesson. Never, ever accept a rental car with damage that is not noted in writing.If you are relying on your own auto insurance coverage your insurance company will make an effort to get the facts. It may still get sorted out as the damage should have been reported when the previous driver returned the car. Unless, it really is a scam and they bring out this damaged car every time they have a late night arrival with lots of luggage and kids."
"<Unless, it really is a scam and they bring out this damaged car every time they have a late night arrival with lots of luggage and kids.>przyk: Your explanation for the scam makes much better sense. I was thinking they smashed a new car each time ;)"
"Here is a new one from Budget. I don't believe other car companies do this, but I was told it was a world wide policy with Budget. My car broke down that I rented off them, and I was unable to get to a gas station to fill the gas tank. They still charged me €50 to fill the tank. These guys have no business ethics, do not rent off any location."
"I doubt it happens very often. Did they bring you a replacement rental, or what did you do after the car broke down?"
"I was able to get a replacement no problem, like any car company would do. I have now found out Avis and Budget are the same company. I rent cars 30-40 times a year, so I looked into this further. If it was Hertz, they have been known to waive the gas charge, especially in these instances."
"I would pursue it further, even contest the charge with your credit card company and see if you can get someone to listen. Your request is probably outside the norm and the key is probably getting to the right person who has the authority to make a decision and the mental capacity to understand the issue."
"Contact corporate...that's what they're there for...I'm sure you'll get it lifted. You likely got a standard response from a ""crib sheet""..."
"Rented a car in Los Angeles, my husband and I waited over 30 minutes for the shutter bus to pick us up at the airport. There were other people waiting, who tried calling to let budget know people were waiting, but no success in reaching anyone, it was 3 in the morning( plane was delayed due to weather).One of the people waiting said that this happens all the time, we saw other rental car shutters go by, sometimes more than 3 to 4 times.When the shutter finally came, the people who were on board said they had waited over 45 minutes.I don't know if I would use them again for this reason, everything else was fine, but after a long flight you don't want to wait for a shutter for 30 minutes."
"First, before you accuse me, I do not work for Budget. I've rented from them and from their sister company Avis, fairly often and I travel almost twice a month for business. I also rent from Hertz, National, and others. I don't really think 30 minutes of waiting for a shuttle bus at LAX is that bad. That doesn't mean it's right or that you shouldn't attempt to contact Budget corporate and voice your concerns. I'd focus on the fact that you could not reach the office by phone. The situation you describe of competitor's shuttles passing by may just have more to do with one company's presence at LAX or # of reservations. I guess if it really was a big deal, you could have taken a taxi to the rental office. I mean for $5-$10 cab vs. your time and patience at the end of a long night - it's a no-brainer for me."
They are crooks!! Stole our car seat! We left it in the car when we returned our rental. Phoned within 30 minutes (realized once we'd gotten to airport). They said they had no record of it being in the car and were not liable. How convenient when they rent out car seats! Cost us $370!!! Don't ever use Budget!
"Sounds to me like your car seat was lost by you, left behind, not stolen. It's unfortunate it was not returned, but since they rent out car seats it probably just got mixed in with theirs."
"Maybe you should consider filing a police report? Especially if you have the pertinent information like part number and serial number....For $370, I'd consider putting a tracking device on it. I left a tablet computer on a plane once, my own fault and my own rush/stupidity. I phoned the airport/airline about an hour later (I was connecting) and several times thereafter, with no luck. It was entirely my fault, but I still fly US Air."

Don't leave your car seat in it how is it their fault ....DUH!!!
"Renter beware. Do not use Budget Car rental. Not only do they add on services sneakily, but they also are now into blaming employee or previous driver missed damage on the next unsuspecting renters. The Baltimore Airport Budget has no contracts, no paperwork, few cars available, no walk-arounds, and then when you return the car, they'll be sure to find some damage and force you to be liable for it. Take pictures, take video, document everything about the car. And be careful - it's not just about signing a contract or agreement - they'll get you just for getting in the car and starting it."
Have used Budget many times and always been very happy with their services. i wouldn't consider them much different from any of the other car rental companies in the USA.
"I certainly would never take a rental car off the lot until I had a signed contract listing the charges. I've never heard of this. Perhaps they don't give you a copy unless you ask, but this does not sound right. Usual complaints are that the agent added extras that were not agreed to, but the customer fails to look at their contract at the time of rental."
"I rented from Budget at Southwest Florida International Airport. I had prepaid for the rental because I did it on credit card points. The agent asked me if I had a lot of suitcases. I said I did. She told me she was giving me an SUV so I'd have the space. I looked at the contract and the total said $245. I thought that was the price I'd prepaid, so I asked the agent and she confirmed it was so I signed the rental agreement. When I got my credit card bill with the charge I called to inquire and was told that I'd upgraded 3 car classes. The agent never told me she was upgrading me and certainly didn't tell me about the additional fees. All Budget would do was give me half the money back. They flat out refused to make it right. I'm sure that if I'd thoroughly read through the rental agreement I would have caught it, but in the chaos of the rental counter I'd merely skimmed it and verbally confirmed with the agent my understanding of the price. I just can't believe Budget is not willing to make this right. My theory is that the agents get some kind of a bonus for up selling the customer."
"<I'm sure that if I'd thoroughly read through the rental agreement I would have caught it, but in the chaos of the rental counter I'd merely skimmed it and verbally confirmed with the agent my understanding of the price. >So, how is this Budget's fault? You admitted you didn't read the Terms & Conditions or ask follow-up questions. My opinion: This was your own fault and since Budget met you halfway, that's very generous of them (and no, I don't work for them)."
"bk, I agree with you in that ewellman could have avoided the problem by reading the contract. However these bait and switch practices seem to be fairly widespread with rental car companies. Consumers have to protect themselves, but that doesn't make right what the agent did. Unfortunately when you have a written contract that says you agreed to a price it's difficult to say you didn't agree to it. I am surprised Budget offered any compensation.Because I've read about these practices I take the time to review rental agreements before I take possession of a car. In fact, when possible I avoid the dreaded agent talk by joining the rental company's club, pre registering and going directly to the garage to pick up my car. That may not be possible if you pay with points, idk."
"I guess I wonder what Budget gains by a ""bait and switch"" tactic from one of its agents? I mean, all one needs to do is report the incident to corporate or to the outlet/franchise manager and they'll surely investigate. I cannot think Budget corporate wants agents who are not truthful to customers or to lose a customer forever. For the situation above, all the poster would have needed to ask is whether this was an upcharge, since the rental was somehow paid on points. I don't know how one could confuse $245 with 0 and surely the point redemption offer had it's own set of Terms & Conditions which likely excluded upgrades. Again, my opinion."
"I've just read many posts, a lot of them on Florida destination forums, but really all over that it seems these deceptive practices are taking place. Whether agents are working on commission or why this is happening I don't know, but it's not just Budget it's most of the rental car companies.I think what is important is for customers to take the time to look over the contract before they drive off in the car. I've read about upgrades and insurance add ons that were not wanted. Whether it is incompetence or intentional who knows, but lots of people seem to be getting burned by these surprise charges."
"BEWARE OF BUDGET CAR RENTALS: I reserved a Budget rental in Germany and the ONLY option I requested was a navigation system. Upon arrival and going through the check-in process, the agent explained to me, there is a refueling option. She went on to explain: ""The way the refueling option works is if you do not return the car full of fuel, you will pay $83.54 Euros."" Because I was flying out early the next day, I made sure the tank was absolutely full the night before.Upon return of the vehicle, I was charged the $83 Euros regardless. I contacted Budget and they explained to me that the refueling option did not work the way it was described to me and they refused to refund the money the money to me.THIS WAS A MISLEADING OPTION AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE YOU AVOID USING BUDGET ALTOGETHER. I gave them three opportunities to make it right and they refused.!!! Shame on you Budget!!! Remember, there are many car rental choices available."
"There are many choices, right. Most all of them offer the fuel option. You possibly misunderstood. Had you not purchased the fuel option and brought the car back with less than a full tank they would have charged you a premium to fill it. Because you purchased the fuel option you should have returned the car as empty as possible as they would then fill it.You would have agreed to and signed for this charge at the time of rental.Edited: 6 years ago "
"This is not just Budget - every major car rental place does the same thing, now. So if you are going to avoid Budget based on that issue, you'd best not be renting a car again.This fuel option is an easy decision - say ""no"" and bring the car back full. I don't want to be driving around with a car almost empty when I am driving to pick up a flight. I certainly don't want the risk of running out of fuel on my way there.If the tank is completely empty then yes, their fuel works out cheaper, but as soon as you have even a little left in the tank, it is far cheaper to pay the local pump prices. The rental company's argument that it is cheaper per gallon is fine, as long as you use *all* of it."
"I always ask if I can take my unused fuel with me after I return the car. I have gotten some puzzled looks from agents, but eventually they figure out that I am not going to buy a tank of gas from them upfront."
"BEWARE of Budget. They are far away the worst of all the majors (I assume that now applies to Avis also). I rent regularly (Thrifty & Dollar are usually very good). This time I tried using Priceline and they came up with Budget. I was renting out of Norfolk. First the agent tried ""upselling"" everything he could think of, and kept at it even after I told him I wanted no additional charges. Then he continued with adding on insurance that I didn't need until I told him to stop. Then I asked about satellite radio (which is standard in most rentals these days, if the car is equipped with it). I was told that it would be a $6 charge. I asked if that was per day or total and the rental agent said total. When I turned in my car, I was charged a total of $18.29. I called the Budget customer service later to inquire and after being kept on hold for about 10 minutes white they researched, was told that this was a per day charge, and they didn't care what the agent told me, this was just the way it is. So beware---stay away from Budget, and Avis for that matter since they are one and the same. Completely disreputable."
"2 clicks - and yes, I realize that the agent gave you a bad quote. But, still, did $6 total really make sense to you? Does Budget offer satellite radio in its rental cars? Answer: Yes. Now you can enjoy premium music and entertainment with Budget Blast, our new portable XM Satellite Radio service. It’s available in most Budget rental cars in the U.S. for $4.99 a day or $20 a week. Budget Blast offers over 170 channels and the most commercial-free music as well as play-by-play sports coverage, news and talk radio shows, comedy programming, and Disney shows for the kids. If this option is available for your rental, you'll see it as an optional selection on Step 3 of the online reservation process."
"I have used Budget in Florida for past ten years or so, mainly because they give you spouse driver free, but have not come across this latest scam. On picking up our vehicle no mention was made either verbally or in contract of ezetoll device fitted to windscreen hidden behind rear view mirror. We eventually spotted it but were unaware what it was and paid our tolls in cash. Eventually a tollbooth cash collector told us what is was and to switch it off as you will pay twice for using tolls. If it is triggered once they will charge you for month plus tolls.On returning car was toldthat it should have been switched off before car rented out and there was nothing they could but would look into it.My rental was in Oct 2013 but they have waited till the end of March 2014 before debiting my credit card, have attempted to contact Budget but as usual after jumping through numerous hoops ,phones, emails etc have got nowhere.Beware of Budget and this con"
"< If it is triggered once they will charge you for month plus tolls.>I guess that the next time you visit Florida, you need to use either Thrifty or Dollar, since they are the only 2 rental agencies without a similar automatic opt-in. Also, it's not a ""months"" worth plus tolls, it's $16.75 max which is just over 4 days of singe day use fees ($3.95). I'm also guessing you will find this written in your original agreement.https://www.sunpass.com/rentalcar"
I rented a car from Alamo in Tampa and it did not have the electronic toll device. I was aware of this issue and asked the garage agent about it.
"I just want to understand why everything is a ""scam"" and a ""con"" now - since those words are tossed around way too often on this board?"
"Yes, bk, I have seen it written that we should have a separate complaint board. In addition if we had a scam/ con board this bargain travel forum would not be very busy would it?"
"I'd like to see a pop-up box for when someone enters a ""new question"" - if you click complaint, it gets diverted to a separate complaint forum where anything goes, vendors can participate, chat, etc. If not a complaint - then we can actually be called ""TripAdvisor"" and help travelers. Just venting. I'm so glad I'm no longer DE for this board."
Sounds like a HUMTAB suggestion....
"I asked about several options, and I think the feedback was that a fundamental change like this would not be considered. TA doesn't understand that the Bargain Travel forum is fundamental ""broken"". tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12104-k6026386…tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12104-k5781632…tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12104-k6481671…"
"I'm not going to mention a separate complaint board again. Otherwise I guess I will be just another one of the complainers on this board, lol.And actually good information can be gained by reading about the mistakes of others and the responses that show how to avoid those mistakes."
"My wife and I recently rented a Budget car in Liberia, CostaRica; declined all the offers for insurance only to have the clerk check the ACCEPT column; agree with us that we were not taking any additional charges except the prepaid gas and had me initial.He then folded up the contract and slipped it into the envelope and not til I got home did we find out that a $411.00 bill had become $699.00 and their comment on the phone was it was my responsibility to check what I was signing,not that the clerk should not have checked exactly what he and I had agreed I DID NOT WANT. We have travelled extensively rented hundreds of cars and NEVER gotten any additional insurance.Seems pretty unlikely Budget will ever see us as customers again."
"We returned from our trip, to find an extra $319.54 charge on our card, when we expected only the cost of a tank of gas.On arrival at Budgets desk, we were asked if we wanted to pre pay our gas, to which we agreed. She then asked for our credit card, and my husbands signature. Unknown to us, she had added a load of extra insurances to our cover.Initially Budget refused a refund, as they claim we had signed for the extras, however after much negotiation, our car hire broker eventually managed to get them to refund half the extra money taken.We are Florida villa owners who depend on people loving Orlando, and wanting to return again and again, and this type of thing could absolutely put them off. We've hired from Dollar for 10 years, and never had this happen, albeit they have often tried to sell us extras. Budget don't even try to sell them to you, they just add them without your knowledge! What a way to treat visitors who keep your company in business."
It was nice of Budget to refund half the money since you got full insurance coverage for your rental. Would you have asked for a refund had you crashed the car? Probably not since you could have just just signed and walk away from it. How many times will you be posting this same thing? It's beginning to look like spam.
"Smottnorwell: It actually appears you are in the wrong here and you may want to do your research BEFORE making accusations. I've also rented a car in CR. You cannot uncheck ALL insurance. Liability coverage is mandatory. If you don't believe me, have a look at this post from the Costa Rica forum, regarding Budget, but liability insurance in general. tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g291982-i813-k5478…"

Did that person really just accuse BK of being a contract reader?
"Explain how Budget is screwing the poster in #81, when the poster neglected to understand liability insurance? Explain how Budget is screwing the poster in #82, when they chose not to review their agreement before signing? I guess I don't part with my hard earned money that easily.

I work for ALL agencies, and now I'm accused of being a smart aleck and actually reading contracts. ugh..Edited: 6 years ago "
"<<<<<you have time to read every contract....Nah.....no need to read any contract, just sign it. Here is a pen.....LOL"
"<What you are is ....just not a nice person><and we also hope that when we get on the plane that you will not be in the seat next to us>These sound to me like attacks and threats, so I'm reporting your post. I'm sorry you don't like the advice I've offered. I hope you have better success in renting from competitors of Budget. A little more advice, just make sure you don't rent from Avis either, because they own Budget."
"I'm going to have to go ahead and agree with Jan on one point. Customers should be able to rely on what the agent tells them. Unfortunately I have read too many stories about customers thinking they are agreeing to one thing when the contract says something else. Perhaps it is a conspiracy of fraud or incompetence of the agents. Either way, it doesn't matter. You will be responsible for whatever charges are on the contract.The message then, in my opinion should be read your contract before you accept your car. It really only takes a minute or two to compare the estimated total price to the price on your reservation and verify that the insurance and other up charges have been declined.The message that Budget is a scam, or don't ever use Budget is not helpful. These issues are being reported form customers of most car rental agencies. The key is to be prepared. And as I have often suggested, join the free club of any car rental agency and you can often avoid the dreaded conversation with the desk agent and go directly to the garage to pick up your car."
"<The message that Budget is a scam, or don't ever use Budget is not helpful. These issues are being reported form customers of most car rental agencies.

I agree with you 100% and to offer additional evidence one can go to the main search box for TripAdvisor (the one in the upper right corner of the page) and type in budget car scam, avis scam, hertz scam, national car scam, dollar car scam, etc. and get back hundreds or more posts - you get my point. If one is holding one company accountable for these practices, they need to hold them all accountable or just be aware or prepared."
"I rented a car from Budget in Denver last fall (2013), was talked into upgrading, and left the counter ignorant of the fact that there was a charge for activating the toll-paying gimmick.. I then asked some guy in the parking lot to show me on a map how to get to the Interstate that would take me to northern Montana, and he told me skip the toll road near the airport to avoid activating the device. it was, he said, the only toll road would see on our trip, save us 15 minutes, and would activate a daily charge for the twelve days we had the car. He did not say there was a maximum charge, and I took his word for it. Hawkeye can direct his ire at that guy; of course Budget should get credit for limiting what it takes the unwary. Assuming it does--I have to rely on Hawkeye for thatAs to the unnecessary insurance our guest from England was induced to buy, she should know that when your come to a country with a primitive health-financing system, people take advantage of you. The fact that she was dealing with a major American company on a routine transaction did not relieve her of the need to stand at the counter and read the small print, to make sure she wasn't being asked to buy something ore than what she asked for."
"I too, got scammed by budget. I rented from atlas choice which is budget. After a few days a light came on that stated :""engine maintenance"" We took the car to budget and got another car. We decided to return the car 5 days early. The budget people stated we would get a refund for the unused days. Now we find out we are only getting $35. We paid $40.26 per day!! What a ripoff."
"What makes you think Atlas Choice is Budget? I never heard of it, but looking at the website it appears to be a booking agency. They deal with most of the major rental companies. If you had rented directly from Budget you would not have paid anything until you returned the car, so there would have been nothing to refund. This shows another good reason not to book cars thru third parties."
"David,You might want to read the ongoing post about Gold Car rental. There are lots of complaints about that European agency. No matter where you rent a car in this world you need to be prepared. It's not just a USA problem. We have enough disagreement around here. We don't need to interject political opinions."
"Marian: Atlas Choice, as stated, is a 3rd party broker - a middleman. They have no affiliation with Budget other than the fact that they have many car rental companies they work with. From the looks of it, they operate on a voucher system. They already have a thread here, so maybe you can repost your complaint with them here: tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12290-k5860228…As for cancellation policies and early returns, they are clearly posted in the Terms & Conditions, which apparently nobody reads except me. online.atlaschoice.com/cars/termsandcond.html<No refunds will be given for rentals ended early, late collections, no shows or cancellations made after the rental start date, even if Cancellation Fee Waiver is taken.>"
Marian.....You didn't get scammed by Budget or anyone else.You paid your money to Atlas. They make it very simple and clear in the short and easy to read T&Cs. This is what they say....Early ReturnThere is no refund for early returns.
"On Monday, April 7, 2014, I had a terrible experience with a Budget car rental. I had been awake for 18 hours, flying across the country after a week away from home. Aircraft mechanical problems had caused me to miss my connection to Santa Barbara in Phoenix, and the two remaining flights were full. After failing to get a seat on standby, I decided to change my plans. I would fly in to LAX, rent a car, and drive home instead. I called Budget from Phoenix, and arranged to pick up a car at LAX after I’d landed.  The plan seemed to be working. By 11:30 that night, I was half an hour from home. It was then, on an empty stretch of freeway at least ten miles from the nearest service station in either direction, that the engine shuddered and died.  Luckily, there was no traffic nearby. I was able to coast from the center lane to the shoulder of the freeway and come to a stop next to a huge erosion abatement wall. I don’t think I would have made it if I’d been boxed in by other traffic. If I’d been stranded on the freeway itself, I would almost certainly have been rear-ended eventually. What had happened? I tried re-starting the engine, but it wouldn’t run. The fuel tank warning light had also come on. I had, apparently, run out of gas.  I was shocked. Budget had charged me $400 for a 1-way, 1-day car rental, and then had given me a car that didn’t even have enough gas in the tank to register on the gauge?  Well, that did explain why the gas gauge display didn’t seem right. I had looked at it when I started the car, and I wondered why there was only a single, thin line connecting the Empty and Full marks. I guessed that maybe the line itself might disappear as the tank emptied. It didn’t even occur to me, especially in my travel-weary state, that the tank might be too empty to even register. Of all the times that I’ve rented cars, and I’ve rented a lot of them, I have never been given one that had less than a quarter tank of fuel.  I was lucky in one regard: I’m a AAA member, and I had a cell phone signal. AAA sent a service vehicle with two gallons of gasoline, enough to get me to the next service station. Forty-five minutes later, I was on my way again. The Highway Patrol dispatcher told me that if I’d been another mile or two further up the road, I would not have had a cell phone signal at all, and I might have been stranded for hours. I called Budget’s customer service number the next morning. The man who answered seemed unperturbed by my complaint. “I’m sorry this happened to you,” he said without much real concern in his voice, “but there’s not much I can do. I just changed the initial fuel level to a quarter tank, but that’s the only adjustment I can make.”  Steve, the desk agent at the Santa Barbara Airport Budget desk, was much more helpful and empathetic when I returned the car. He gave me a significant discount on the rental, under the category of “on-the-road expenses,” and said he was very sorry that I’d been put in such a potentially dangerous situation.  I wasn’t so concerned about the money. I knew the car was going to be expensive when I rented it, and I was desperate enough to get home that I agreed to the rate. What mattered more to me was having a feeling that someone at Budget actually regretted what had happened to me. I appreciated Steve’s obvious concern, and his sincere desire to make amends for the situation.  As it stands, despite Steve’s good efforts, I doubt that I will ever rent from Budget again. You can bet, too, that whenever I rent a car from now on, regardless of how late it is or how tired I am, I’m going to make sure that the tank is full before I drive it anywhere."
"There are a lot of weird digital displays on cars these days, but I'm curious what kind of car you rented that you couldn't read the gas gauge. I've never had a rental that was not full, except the occasional failure to top it off. I do look at the gauge before I drive off because I know I will have to fill up the tank before I return the car."
"C'mon przyk, we've been to this dance before. You read the story - not my fault because I had been flying for 18 hours and was tired... stuck in the middle of nowhere. Half of the information shared is irrelevant. But, I agree with you, I check the gauge. In fact, many airports with manned exit booths, where you reshow your ID, also ask to double check the fuel gauge."
">>>I was lucky in one regard: I’m a AAA member, and I had a cell phone signal<<<I just want to take what bk pointed out, one step further. You were lucky? You know who I think were lucky? Other drivers on the road - considering you were driving after being awake for 18hrs, and angry your travel plans went pear shaped.If you're going to add irrelevant information, perhaps you should consider not including information that makes you look like you made a poor judgement decision.Edited: 6 years ago "
What are the best car rental services provided to the customers of the UK?
"Sushmagu, you might want to start a new thread on this subject, since this thread seems to be about people complaining about their experiences with Budget Car rentals"
"I still want to know what car has such a confusing gas gauge. I have to admit I've had difficulties figuring out windshield wipers, radio operation and things like that in rental cars. I ended up with a Prius in Vegas one time and that was a little confusing to get used to. But, I can't recall every having a weird gas gauge."

#108 - Surveys are not allowed on TripAdvisor - Reported.
Unfortunately I have to report the same bad experience with Budget. We booked a car and paid through Rental Car from Italy and were provided with a voucher. At the airport counter we were said that the credit card provided during the booking procedured wan for reservation purposes only and we were asked to provide again a credit card. Upou return we found out they we had been charged twice with different amounts (147 eurso and 191 euros). After enquiring with Budget they said the second was a contract for options and that they always ask their clients to be very careful with what they sign after long tiring flights. We have the email... Rental car was not helpful either...
"I recently rented from Budget at Montreal's Trudeau airport. No issues until i got my bill by email, on which I discovered 3 separate unjustified charges, the worst of which was a full tank of gas at their high rates, whereas I had returned the tank full and the receiving employee had checked it in front of me! The worst part of the story was the nightmare their customer service drones gave me when I tried to explain that those multiple errors had been made and at least get my money back (never mind any compensation for the massive waste of time involved). I was basically dismissed by multiple employees over email and phone, and treated like a lying con artist. I even started suspecting a company practice of systematic ""error"" insertion with the hope that the client (especially corporate renters) wouldn't notice. When i did notice, instead of acknowledging their multiple errors and compensating me for the inconvenience, those jokers wouldn't even try to understand where the errors were and just rattled off robotically company regulations and contract clauses regarding the importance of receipts to prove that i had indeed filled my gas tank!after finally reaching one of the managers at the location itself (all the while raking up overseas long-distance charges and waiting on hold for minutes on end), that person (Chuck) had the decency and common sense to check the way my account had been closed and discovered where every one of the overcharges had come from: careless human error. he of course proceeded to refund all the unjustified charges to my credit card with a sincere apology. as for compensation, i have yet to receive any form of it (apart from a promise from Chuck to ""make it up to me"" the next time i rented from their office!), which brings the likelihood of me going back to Budget/AVIS anywhere in the world down to 0.for those who actually are con artists, i learned something from this nightmarish experience, which you can use in the face of their absurd regulations: return the tank almost empty, have them email you your receipt, then call back later and dispute their tank-refuelling charge, saying you returned it full and providing that magic receipt for the 5 or 10 dollars of gas you bought from a nearby gas station just before returning your car. the brainless robots kept insisting that was all i needed to prove i was telling the truth about returning the tank full. in an industry in which a client has no choice but to trust that he/she is being given a safe and functioning car, and the company must trust that the client is returning a car without any concealed disasters, insisting on receipts as ""proof"" is ridiculous, and placing the onus of proving that a discrepancy was not caused by the client fully on him/her is unfair at best. at least in my case, the absurd rules and MO of Budget/AVIS did not protect them from fraud, and their lack of trust and good judgment is clearly going to cost them much more than a tank of gas..."
"Encouraging readers to ""con"" the rental car company is illegal and I've reported your post for suggesting someone to do this. As for the rest, I keep my receipt and have been asked to show it by all the majors - Hertz, Avis, Budget, National, and Enterprise - so I'm guessing you shouldn't rent from any of these companies either."
Bk-t1 do you ever stop...how many people are you going to complain about...and have their comments taken away....Have a heart...all of these people have had a terrible time with Budget....do you work for them...or are you just smarter than the rest of us...go to another site and let us complain and feel better....
"Jan: So, it's ok in your mind for someone to encourage people on this board to ""con"" a company? Seriously? I only report posts which do not follow TA guidelines - and my report of a post does not make it go away."
"The con is silly. They can see how many miles you've put on the car because they keep track of beginning and ending miles. If you drove 200 plus miles and turned in a receipt for $5.00 I think they could figure out that you didn't fill up the tank.It's ridiculous to be asked to provider a receipt? Really? What I think is ridiculous is not looking at the receipt Budget provided to you at the time you rented the car. You could have seen that they were billing you for a full tank of gas and whatever other unwanted charges were on the bill could have been resolved before you drove away from the airport.I do believe car rental companies are taking advantage of customers, but this is happening with all of them. So taking your business elsewhere and assuming things will go better may end up in frustration again. What may help is educating yourself to what the car rental companies are doing and protecting yourself by looking at all your charges and keeping receipts."
"przyk: Again, your post is spot on. I wonder if it might be helpful to compile some of these thoughts in a traveler article or post which could be turned into an FAQ or sticky - Handy Guide to Car Rental or Car Rental Watchouts? I'm not suggesting the complaint threads will stop, but there might a few folks who might come to this forum before renting and find it."
"Good idea bk. Then I could at least just link the article rather than feeling like Bill Murray in the Groundhog Day movie. I haven't read thru the 12 pages of posts on this thread, but when I am totally bored I may just do that and see how many times the same points come up in answers. And then how many similar threads are out there like those under the Hotwire or Priceline complaint threads among others."
"Bait and Switch.We ordered a rental car from Price line and received an agreeable price. Upon arriving at the rental car company in St. Louis. We went over the contract. They tried to slip everything possible into that price even filling our tank for us at a cheaper cost. The last time we did that we paid for a full tank even though our tank was half full. So we declined that, we declined the insurance which would have been higher than the cost of the rental car. Budget then showed us paperwork to sign and implied that they were upgrading a car for us. We assumed that it was a kindness they were showing by upgrading, some companies to that without charging. Budget charged an additional $15.00 a day for an upgrade we really didn't need or want. So an additional $98.00 was added to our bill. Be cautious of this company and take the time to read all that is thrown at you."
"<Be cautious of this company and take the time to read all that is thrown at you.>Yes, and if you had taken the time to find this post and read it before you rented, it sounds like you would have been $98 richer.By the way, this is not bait and switch at all, which has very specific legal conditions associated with it.Edited: 6 years ago "
"""Be cautious of this company and take the time to read all that is thrown at you.""That applies to every car rental agency that I have done business with in several countries. Understand what you are accepting and get in writing what the price is going to be."
"< We assumed that it was a kindness they were showing by upgrading,>If you read all that is thrown at you, you won't have to assume."

"Europe car Sucks.....I hired a 1.5tone van from your Dandenong office on Friday the 9th May. This is to move a fridge from Dandenong to Hallam. I called this office on Thursday Morning and inquired about the pricing, and the gentleman I spoke to told me that he can give me a 1.5Ton van for $110 including GST for a day. I told him that I don't want the van for a day, can I have it for few hours. And he told me that he can give me the van only for a day but not on hourly or for a half day.Then I made the booking at the time for a day $110.Then I went to collect the van on Friday 4.50pm, and the guy who served me asked when I can return the van. I said I have only a fridge to carry therefore I can return the Van on Saturday morning. Then he said that I can return the van in the morning and we are open from 8am. I said fine, I will come in the morning.So, I did my job and returned the van on Saturday morning at 9.05 am. Then the drama begins. The person was at the counter told me that I was supposed to return the van at 8.00am on Saturday and now I am late for an hour. He also said that he had another booking for the same van at 8am Saturday morning and as I was late he couldn't hire the van. (But he was failed to show me such a booking.) Therefore he was going to keep my deposit of $322 for the one hour delay which wasn’t a day (24hours) since I hired the van. Then he told me a day that they consider is “from 4.50pm till Saturday morning at 8am”. I was in shock. This was the first time I ever heard a day that short in my whole life. Then he went on and on and on about the paper work and showed me that I have signed to returned the Van at 8am. At this stage I was tired talking to him, and then I told him alright you do whatever you want to do and give me the balance as I was supposed to drop one of my friends to the airport at 11am. Then he went nuts. He said that I won’t be able to refund a cent to you, and you are not listening to me. Listen what I am saying…, and again he was trying to explain the number of hours in a Europe car’s day. Then I had to tell him that I will take this issue to the consumer affairs as a complaint against your company because my document says that I hired the van for a day. Then he asked me the name of the person I spoke to when I made the booking. I said I don’t know. Then he asked me again the same question, and again I said I didn’t see he was wearing a name tag or anything. Then he asked me whether the person is short, young, old tall etc. I said he was a young guy. Then he said alright I will call him. Then he called someone I am not sure who he spoke to anyway finally he said that I am supposed to charge $198 but I will only be charged $51 as a late fee. Again I am not sure how he calculated such an amount.Anyway this pathetic guy’s name is Michael as he was on a call while treating me like an animal, and I overheard his name. He didn’t even have a name tag or a business card in the vicinity. Now I want Europe cars to look into their customer service officers, specially the Michael at Dandenong who worked on last Saturday morning. Needless to say that I am also a customer service Manager and have won an excellence in customer relations and service award from Australian Achiever award. This is an appalling customer service I have ever seen in my life.This was my 6th time I went a Europe car to hire a vehicle and of course will be the last."
#125 - I do not understand. This thread is about Budget Car not Europe Car.... Reported for wrong forum.
"We recently hired a car from GLASGOW city base Budget rentals in the UK to be dropped off at Glasgow Airport after 16 days. The booking was made and paid for about 6 months in advance ... (silly I know ! ) for a 5 door vehicle group E on the web site, When we arrived at the depot we were offered a 3 door Vauxhaul astra and told that this car was all that was available. (So much for booking ahead !!)No offer of an up-grade etc... it was ""take it or leave it !The car company then also TRIED to charge a 48.00 pounds UK one-way fee, even though our contract had no such fee in it. ( we were told that Budget had introduced the fee the week before our hire !!) ......BEWAREOn top of that their was a re-fill fee of 69.16 pounds UK in case the car was not returned full of petrol.... no mention of this either in our contract.The ""hold"" on our credit card came to 117.16 pounds UK.The Vauxhaul was a new ""yuppie"" machine with a very low roof line, making entry and exit very difficult, along with a long sloping front window causing a lot of light reflection on the dash.... not nice on the eyes in some driving conditions.We consider the car totally unsuitable as a rental vehicle.Watch Budget car rentals Glasgow VERY carefully and do not sign anything until you are 100% sure of the contract."
"When I returned the rental car at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Rental return, I was issued a Receipt. The receipt reads as follows:**11.11% Fee... 15.53Fuel Purch opt 52.86PAE/ESP/SLI CHG 86.94CUST FAC CHARGE 6.00/DY 36.00ENERGY RECOVERY .60/DY 3.60MTNC FAC FEE 1.19 D/Y 7.14 YOUR SUBTOTAL TAXABLE SUBTOTAL 146.73 TAX 15.300% 62.02NON TAXABLE ITEMS COUNTY SURCH 13.17TOTAL CHARGES 183.66My problem is that 15.300% of 146.73 = $22.44, NOT 62.02The service agent at the rental car return said I have to call customer service, the receipt prints automatically and she has no control over the tax being wrong.I called customer service. The rep I spoke to refused to listen to me as I tried to explain that 15% of 146.73 is 22.44, NOT 62.02. She kept telling me tax is not refundable or changeable - again, she simply was not listening to me.I demanded a supervisor and was told there are no supervisors for me to talk to. I'd have to leave my name and ph# and someone would call me back in 24 hours.I will never rent from Budget again, and am now on a campaign to tell this story thru reviews on every web review site I can post it on, hoping to inform people to stay away from Budget. It's a shame they choose to loose customers and large sums of return business over an obvious error like this over charge of $39.58.I travel for work and use a lot of rental cars. Budget just lost all of my business over this 39.58 overcharge, and I hope everyone that reads this review will take their money elsewhere, to!!"
That is a messed up receipt. When I add up the individual charges though it looks to me like the total should have been over $200 even with your tax computation of $22.42. What am I missing?
Kevin....If the sub total is $146.73 and your tax figure is $22.44 plus the $13.17 = $182.34It doesn't appear they actually added $62.02 to the sub total.Those codes on the receipts are hard to figure out. I'd relax until you hear from Budget and get an explanation.
"We're both missing something. I can't get any of the numbers to add up to 146.73. If you do the math, 62.02 is 15.300 % of 405.35, and the entire receipt full of numbers doesn't add up to that.Budget just called me and simply stated that their calculation is right and they are not refunding anything. She refused to explain the calculations to me, probably because she is an $8.00 customer service rep, not an accountant.I'm an accountant, I can't make sense of it. I also sit on the committee at work that approves and removes vendors. Budget is going out the door."
"I just heard from them. The ""alleged"" customer service supervisor refused to refund the tax overcharge, and would not explain the convoluted charges to me. Probably because she is a cust service rep and doesn't have any better clue about them than we do.Bottom line, I'm an accountant at work. I sit on the committee that approves/removes vendors. Budget rent a car is getting thrown out. This is not the first billing issue we have had with them, but it will be the last.There are just too many complaints against Budget concerning mysterious and unexplained fees and charges."
"Ouch, if you are an accountant that bill must be giving you the worst headache of all time."
Is that the complete receipt? Something is missing. The daily charge for the car itself isn't even there.
"You're right, the bill makes no sense any way you look at it. By the way, I grew up in Milwaukee-East Side-moved to New Orleans when I was 31-29 years ago. I'm going to scan and post a copy of the receipt so you can all see for yourself.I know all rental car companies are bad, but Budget is the worst."
"I've reported #131 and #132 - stick to the facts. No need to attack someone who you've never met. It's also irrelevant what he/she makes as a wage. And that doesn't mean I don't agree with the need for clarification, just stay on topic, please."
"I don't normally even look at all the individual charges on my bill. I just look at my reservation and see that the totals match the receipt I get when I turn in the car. Of course that is for my personal travel. I understand for business travel and reimbursement you want to make sure that everything adds up.Bottom line in this situation it appears the customer was undercharged and no matter how he tries Budget does not want to hear that they shortchanged themselves, lol."
"I cannot advise against using Budget enough. I was in Ireland for over a week, looking to hire a car. I filled out all the forms and put my age (as i was under 25 years i expected a fee or surcharge). I satisfied all other requirements, and checked the T&C's to be sure due to being 24. I get to the rental desk for them to say I must be over 25 in Ireland to hire a car. I told them their website only mentions a possible ""surcharge"", but at no point did it say this age requirement. The person at the desk could not get rid of me quick enough. Avis next door was at least friendly and tried to help out.I emailed their main website for Ireland, close to 2 months ago now, and i'm yet to get any final answer. They replied to me after two emails (3 weeks apart), and it was to say they're looking into it. It's now 3 weeks later again, and i've emailed a third time, with no reply (11 days later at this point).At all costs, avoid their company."
"<Avis next door was at least friendly and tried to help out.><At all costs, avoid their company.>You do realize that Avis owns Budget? Anyways, since you have been a member of TripAdvisor for over 2 years, you could have done your research, possibly a visit to the Ireland forums to look up the minimum rental age - and you might have seen this thread.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186605-i90-k75275…"
"I rented from Budget at the Atlanta airport on Saturday, June 21, 2014. What a disaster. The first employee with whom I dealt, Monet, was incompetent. The woman who claimed to be her manager was a horrid, screaming, lying excuse for a customer service employee. I have rented from Budget for decades and will never, ever go there again. TERRIBLE, LYING EMPLOYEES."
"MookieHouston - And your rant and personal attack on the company and agent, are pretty much meaningless unless you provide details to the readers on your situation."
"This is a about Budget at the SEATAC airport, but is probably true with all the car rentals at all airports.We rented from Budget online at a facility some 5 miles from the SEATAC airport near Seattle. The price was $222 for 9 days. Due to airline mechanical problems we arrived 5 hours too late to pick up the car (they closed at 5 PM), so we had to rent at the SEATAC airport. The same car, same number of days was $566. This is 2.5 times more and only a small part of the increase was ""airport fees."""
"Fitz M: There are countless post here on TripAdvisor (Seattle forum) and on other forums (like flyertalk) about the exorbitant fees for renting at the central airport facility, vs. off-site. I saw one post that mentioned a daily fee in addition to a tax rate over 11%. This is not unusual and I see this a lot at many airports I travel. Unfortunately, I'm guessing you gave up a great local weekly rental rate when your plans and rental office changed, in addition to the higher fees. This is hardly Budget's fault. So, why not pursue this with your travel insurance?"
"I recently hired a car using Budget Car Rental in Malta, Luqa. When we arrived in Malta, the Budget representative asked us if we wanted to purchase Super Collision Damage Waiver. We said we definitely didn't want it as it cost more than the car rental. She waved a typed agreement in front of us and asked us to sign it, which we did, then she took it back and handwrote something in it, folded it up, put it in an envelope and handed it to us. Later on, when we looked at the agreement we realised she wrote that we had agreed to the Super Collision Damage Waiver and 72 Euros! The Budget reps get commission for selling Collision Damage Waiver, and clearly some have more underhanded methods to get their commission. We are currently in the complaints process with Budget Car Rental, Expedia (the website who we purchased the rental through) and put in a dispute with our credit card company. Be warned!"
"I had a bad experience too and I too should of read the contract too because apparently what I initialed was NOT what we verbally agreed on. Here's what I posted on their face book page:On June 26th, 2014, Budget rent a car at the Springfield , Missouri airport pulled a bait and switch on us. We had a prepaid reservation for an economy car with unlimited miles. They did not have the economy car and offered a free upgrade. On the contract, they stated I initialed stating I was willing to pay $75 for the upgrade. Verballay I did not agree. I should of read the contract because the attendant pointed out where I was supposed to initial and I initialed it. My bank statement shows they charged me $94 for my prepaid vehicle! They fooled me! BUT WE WILL NEVER AGAIN USE BUDGET RENT A CAR!!"

Buyer beware when renting from Budget. I completed a one day rental on 8/4/14. I returned the car full to the Trenton NJ airport and gave the clerk my receipt but the return area was in a different terminal. Budget personnel took me to the departure terminal 1/2 mile away in the car I rented. I don't know what they did with it after that but they charged my credit card $22.72 for fuel! They charged me $9.49 per gallon for 44 miles. I only drove the car 113 for the whole rental! When I disputed it they said the car was not returned full. What a scam. I will never rent from Budget again. They are unscrupulous and unprofessional.
"Carole.....I assume you got a receipt saying the tank was full? But, if you returned the car to the wrong place, maybe you didn't?I wouldn't call it a scam as returning the car to the wrong place probably contributed to the charge and confusion."
Just returned from a fabulous holiday in Orlando. The only low point of the holiday was renting a car from Budget. Far longer queues waiting to be dealt with than any other renter. It took us over an hour to get our pre-booked car. Very bad airport transfers. Very unhelpful. Would not book with Budget again and would suggest that others give them a very wide berth indeed.Edited: 6 years ago 
"Belinda: Many people know that one of the easiest ways to skip the lines and get your car quickly, is to belong to the car rental agencies frequent renter program. There is no fee and in most cases you don't even speak to a person until you leave the lot and confirm your identity. I belong to Budget's Fastbreak and I cannot remember the last time I waited in a line. BTW, you don't actually need to rent a lot to belong, either."
"<<<<<Very bad airport transfers. Very unhelpful.You would not have needed transfers for a Budget car at MCO.Absolutely no reason to give them a ""wide berth"" because you had to wait an hour. That's just silly.Edited: 6 years ago "
Great point hawkeyetough88 - I forgot that almost ALL car rental agencies are located on-site at MCO. orlandoairports.net/transport/rental_cars.htm
"Thanks for the tip re joining the frequent renter programme bk_t1 - very useful. Hawkeyetough88 - we weren't at MCO we were at Port Canaveral so we did have to transfer for that portion of the rental. My mistake as, you're quite right, this part wasn't an 'airport transfer' it was a 'cruise port' transfer. Sorry for confusion. Whilst I agree that the rentals are conveniently located at MCO, the wait in line for Budget was far longer than other companies. My point in the overal Budget service levels were the low point of our holiday."

"We won't be using Budget again. We had a pre-paid voucher which covered a lot of what we have now been charged for again - so in effect have paid for it twice. The incompetent customer rep at Jacksonville airport converted £528.33 to $533.52 ?what???? So again we have been charged twice for part of the car hire also. We are making an official complaint as we were charged RSn (in effect breakdown cover) which we had verbally declined - we specifically stated to the gentleman that we wanted no extras other than what the voucher covered. We had been travelling for 30 hours (3 flights) and a 2.5hr drive from Jacksonville to Orlando. American Airlines had lost all 6 of our suitcases, we were tired, stressed and angry and again did not check everything before signing. Again we were just told to sign here, here and here. Husband will be ringing them later and I have sent an email of disgust. We have also filed a complaint with the bank as an unauthorised payment. Absolutely disgusted. They would not get away with it in the UK!"
"""Unauthorised payment""? You signed for the charge. You authorized it. All you needed to do was say no and not sign the agreement. Just because someone tells you to sign here and here- you still need to read any contract you sign. It's no different than in the UK. You read contracts there before signing, don't you?If you were too tired to read the paperwork- how on earth did you manage to drive the car?Edited: 5 years ago "
"I am a little more sympathetic than Hawkeye about your level of exhaustion, but he is correct in that you did authorize the charge if you signed for it. Unfortunately these situations seem to happen too frequently with rental cars. I'm afraid your plan to avoid Budget in the future will not work out for you if believe that's all you need to do to avoid unwanted rental charges. This happens with all rental car companies. A better plan is to read before you sign in the future."
"We also have had a bad experience with Budget- this is at the Orlando airport. We prepaid for our rental. Once at the airport to pickup we were offered all of the add ons. Upgrade the car, liablity insurance...etc. We declined, as we always have, everything and then signed the document. Upon returned from our trip we noticed a charge of an additional $63 to our credit card. When we called we were told this was for liablity insurance. I told the agent we NEVER took this insurance. His reply was ""well you signed the contract."" He then gave us the number in Orlando. We were given the same response. We then asked to speak to a manager and were told there weren't any managers available. What I don't understand is if we did want this add on why wouldn't it be charged to us right there at the pick-up desk? Or why didn't the agent say ""that will be an additional $63 charge."" This is a very deceptive practice. My advice would be to never rent from this company or ask about additional charges before you sign anything."
"Laurie....Check your contract and check the receipt you got when you dropped the car.Is the ""liability insurance"" or the $63 shown anywhere? If not, dispute the charge with your credit card issuer. If it appears on your paperwork- you bought it."
"Recently returned from a 2 week stay in Orlando. Budget rent a car., avoid like the plague. I Dont mind queuesI dont Mind rude staff., you kind of expect it., what I cannot tolerate, is being cheated... Just received my credit card statement. $ 214.00 for insurance that I was not even given the chance to refuse. Just sign and initial on the electronic pad., Went through the ritual of refusing upgrade offers, The Budget rep was so friendly, obviously knowing he had caught a ""Live one"" in his net. Take a swipe of your credit card sir, just for vehicle security deposit.. its strange that he didnt advise me at the time of the cost of this additional insurance, maybe because he knew that i would not have accepted it...Cynical me... Received a Generic email response from"" Budget rent a mug"" hoping my experience would not deter me from renting with Budget again. Its no wonder these guys can offer cheap car hire rates, they make their money from conning holidaymakers."

I agree - they are a dreadful company. Never again. We're still in dispute with them 8 weeks after returning from our holiday. Every month another random charge appears on our credit card statement from Budget Rent a Car.
"RENTER BE WARE - SCAM ARTISTS AT THE RENTAL COUNTER!!On Sept 25th, I arrived at the Budget Rental Counter and spoke withMaria (agent). She pulled up my reservation and advised me that theinsurance that I purchased through Priceline did not cover the rentalcar and asked if I would like to purchase their insurance. I asked whydidnt it cover, and Marie stated, because it wasnt purchased throughBudget. My wife was standing right next to me and we then agreed topurchase what Marie explained to me as CDI. We completed thetransaction and we got our rental car and went on our way. When Ireturned home on Sept 29th, I contacted Priceline and asked them aboutthe discrepancy and why I purchased insurance that didnt cover the car Irented. They stated that I was misadvised and that they would file anotice with Budget and find out what happened. They emailed me andstated that I declined the LDW offered by Budget but accepted the SLI atan additional $15.77 per day. First of all, that is further from thetruth. Marie told Marcy and me that I didnt have the correct coverage!Marie misrepresented this to me, and I ended up purchasing additionalcoverage - which I didnt need! I called budget on October 4th andspoke with Tonya who advised me that they would refund 1/2 of theamount. I advised her that this was wrong! Marie scammed me andmisrepresented Budget Rental Car! I feel that this is fraudulentactivity. She stated that she would have someone contact me within 48hrs. Today (10/6) I contacted Customer Service and spoke with Chad.While he pulled up my record, I waited about 3 minutes until he spokewith me. I asked him if he was still there - and he said, yea, imreading. He advised me that I received an email (which I neverreceived) and then said - check your spam. I advised Chad that I havebeen checking my email constantly waiting for a response. Chad toldme that I got an email that stated that they would refund 1/2 of theinsurance cost. I told chad that I didnt receive the email, and Iwanted to speak with a manager. He replied, they are all busy - and Ineed to take another call. REALLY!!! Where is the customer service. I still havent received the email about my refund - but I really wouldlike to speak to a manager and get my money back for this scam. Mariashould be counseled as to how to not scam others into purchasinginsurance they dont need. I am dissatisfied. Budget Rental Car Agent - Maria - is a scam artist. She misrepresented Budget to me.I will not rent from Budget again."
Reported #170. Personal attacks are not allowed in the forums. Leave them out.
"Be extremely careful when you rent a car with Budget in the future, I was charged with an additional 3/4 of the daily rate for returning the car 40 minutes after the time stated in the rental agreement. I think this is such an abusive policy, so I',m never renting with them again."
"<I think this is such an abusive policy, so I',m never renting with them again.>You are obviously free to do what you want, but the rules and rates are very clear about returning a car late. I'm surprised you did not know this or bother to look - 2 clicks on google. budget.com/budgetWeb/…Fees and Taxes - Do late-return fees apply? Answer: Vehicles are rented on a daily (24-hour) basis. There is a 29-minute grace period for returns. After 30 minutes late, hourly car rate charges and taxes may apply. After 90 minutes late, full-day late charges and taxes may apply. After 7 hours late, if you didn't call to extend your rental, an additional $10/day late fee applies. There is no grace period for rental fees, surcharges and optional equipment or protections charges. Full-day late charges will apply for these items. My advice is don't rent cars anymore, since MOST car rental agencies charge late fees - and some offer no grace period at all. Examples: Hertz ($10 for every 15 minutes late, no grace period)."
"I'd have to say I agree entirely with Bk's assessment.It's really not unreasonable to expect penalties for a late return, as the knock on effect can be quite enormous. It can potentially contribute significantly to the next persons' out going rental - which if it were yourself, no doubt you'd be complaining about. So it's not just about the monetary fee, those clauses are included deliberately as a deterrence."
"I had rented a car in Budget at Westchester county airport, White plains NY. It was terrible experience from the day I returned my car till I paid my bills. Let me start with good note. My flight was delayed for an hour and I called Budget rentals and informed that I would be delayed by an hour. They were waiting for me after business hours and handed over the car keys to me and closed their shop. Good............I reserved for a full size car. Since no full size car was available at that time, I was offered a SUV. Fair............ I had my trip and returned my car after the business hours. So they counted a day extra in my bill. Sad............ My reservervation includes a full size car for $30/day ($90 for 3 days). Since I have taken one day extra I am supposed to pay $120 for 4 days but they told me that since I didnt keep up my reservation timings, they had to charge $60 per day and $240 for 4 days. NON SENSE................ The customer care is not willing to hear my words and they keep on asking me to contact the Westchester airport location. I reside in Charlotte, NC. F**K....................... Very disappointed with their customer care and billing. I recommend not to choose BUDGET car rentals.........."
"Guru.....You signed a contract with Budget when you got the car. It will show the per day charge for the 3 days. It should also show the charge if you return the car late. Returning the car late should not change the first three days rate though.If the situation is as you describe......you should be charged 3 days at $30 and one day at, yes, probably $60. The additional days rate is always higher than the previously reserved rate. All car companies do this.Read your contract.....it will have all the answers."
"I don't know, the few times I have rented from locations that are not open round the clock I'm pretty sure the deal was if the car is returned after closing time there is no late charge as long as the car is returned before opening time the following morning."
"If a car is due back at 2pm, for example, and I didn't return the car until after closing time- I would expect to be charged."
"I agree Hawkeye, but since the poster said he picked up the car after closing time I assumed his full day rental period would expire at closing time. I doubt this situation is covered in the T & Cs and I know common sense does not apply. It just doesn't seem right."
"The reservation pick-up time would have been during business hours. I doubt they adjusted the time to the actual time he arrived. Since cars are rented for 24 hour periods- the due back time would have been sometime before they closed. Guru returned the car after closing. He would have had the car for 24+ hours. I often see a per hour late charge that could have been applied here, maybe. But, the agents would not have checked the car back in until sometime the next morning. I think it's unfortunate but hard to argue the extra day charge."
"I know it's not exact, but I found this when I searched ""after hours"" - it was listed in the Budget Fastbreak Master Agreementbudget.com/budgetWeb/…master_printable.htmlReturn of the CarA. You agree to return the car to us in the same condition you received it, ordinary wear and tear excepted, on the due date and at the time and to the location specified by you at the time of reservation. You must return it sooner on our demand. If you return it earlier or later, a different or higher rate may apply and, if returned later, you may be charged a late return fee. You may not return the car at a time when we are closed. If you do, your responsibility for damage to or loss of the car will continue and all charges stated on the rental document as a periodic rate will continue to accrue until the return location reopens and we retake actual possession of the car. If we do not find the car when that location reopens, your responsibility for all charges and for damage to or loss of the car will continue until the car is actually returned or recovered and possession is returned to us."
"I used Economy car rentals on my last trip to Europe and Tuky for the first and last time. First I booked a car for one week in Austria. The car was to be picked up at Graz railway station on a Sunday at 17.00. To reassure myself that the car would be available I rang the company on Friday prior to pick up only to be told that the branch at Graz was closed for the weekend from noon Saturday onwards and that for this reason Economy car rentals was NOT provided with a confirmation number however the voucher did provide me with a made up reservation number. I had to take a special trip into Graz to pick up the car at loss of one day of my holidays and considerable additional expenses.The second rental in Istanbul was a car which was a clapped out Renault, which from the beginning had a slipping clutch. Although I was assured that the car had a spare tyre (I thought this would be automatic) when we had a puncture half way through our trip it turned out that the spare was flat and in no condition whatsoever to be reparable. Loosing half a day to track to a tyre repair place and bearing the taxi cost the clutch finally gave up. After half a further day a replacement was provided, a smaller car with no compensation forthcoming and an empty fuel tank to replace the defunked car one with ¾ of a tank full.But on the bright side Turkish business people are always friendly!!Don’t use Economy car rentals!"
"mullbacher: This whole thread is about Budget Car Rental - the company - and not Economy Car Rental - the company. Unless Budget is dba as Economy, I think your post is misplaced."
"We are travelling to USA and Orlando for the very first time in May 2015 and wondered what your thoughts are on paying extra up front in the rental charge for a 'free tank of fuel' as opposed to returning with a full tank? I know returning with an empty tank and then allowing the rental company to charge you for them to fill up is the most expensive option, so won't do that anyway! Would be interested to hear views on the other two options though please."
"AR72: I always charge my gas and refill myself. It is rare to be able to ""plan"" the car to go empty when you return it. This holds for all rental companies. There are several gas stations near the Orlando airport, just do a map search."
I agree with bk. I tried that option once and in trying to plan to run the gas tank to near empty I actually had to stop before returning the car to add a few gallons to make sure I didn't run out. It was very annoying. I find it much easier to just fill up before I return the car.
"I also agree. Fill the tank yourself. It is a convenience to return the car with whatever gas is in the tank. But, as mentioned it's sometimes difficult to judge. Just north of MCO there are a couple of gas stations that charge $5 or $6 per gallon for gasoline. You'll want to avoid these places. Just be aware and look at the price before you pump gas. There are many complaints on the Orlando forum about people that pump gas and then notice the per gallon price. Just like with buying anything.....check the price, then buy.You are aware of the Orlando forum? It is here..... tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g34515-i19-Orlando…"
"It would appear that most of the car rental companies are employing some pretty shady practises across the globe. It's probably due to a global downturn and they have devised ways of extracting more money from unsuspecting customers. It's an industry out of control and, finding they can all get away with it, have all dipped into the gravy train. A complete overhaul on an international scale needs to be adopted and I think that for all us poor consumers, there is little political will to do anything about it. Maybe it will spur a revival in public transport, who knows. I was stitched up too and followed hundreds of others onto forums to complain and warn others. In all honesty, to little avail. This problem will continue until something is done about it and who is going to do this? As far as I can see so far, nobody."
"Hawk eye, that is great feedback and much appreciated. Just out of interest, what is the usual $ per gallon at the moment in US please?"
"Robert, it's a real shame and I'm just trying to get as much info as possible to avoid the pitfalls. Thanks for posting."
"AR72.....At the present time you should figure $3.00 per gallon in Orlando.<<<<This problem will continue until something is done about it and who is going to do this? As far as I can see so far, nobody.Robert.....I assume you are referring to the complaints about being charged for something the renter did not ask for. The problem will continue until people start reading, or even just glancing at, their contracts before signing and leaving with the car. It can all be fixed easily by just looking at the charges."
Thanks again Hawkeye
"I recently rented a car in San Fransisco from Budget. No toll highways where I live so I inquired as to how the E-Toll transponder worked. They said that the toll would be charged directly to my credit card and that there wouldn't be any additional charges. However, after our trip we got a larger bill. They charge $3.95/day for the entire rental even if you use it only once. The maximum charge is capped at $16.75/month. Also, the toll charge is the maximum amount possible (tolls vary depending on the time of day). I contacted Budget and they said that I should have read the fine print. They should have said ""don't believe what our staff tell you""!"
We recently rented a car from Budget at Boston airport.Have to say they were extremely efficient and were a pleasure to deal with.Our only problem was with a scam email supposedly from EZ regarding a missed toll payment. Luckily our firewall prevented us from opening it but it looked totally legit. When I googled this it warned it was a scam and not to open it
I got that EZ missed toll email too. I got it every other day for a month and haven't rented from Budget in several years.
Ditto here : regarding EZ pass email - nothing to do with Budget or this thread.
"I've also had significant problems with Budget at the Vancouver airport (YVR). I reserved online, phoned their hotline to confirm pickup time (late afternoon), arrived to find that the car I had booked wasn't available because they only allow pickups in the morning. The only cars now available were much more expensive. (Mini van rather than an economy.) I will never use Budget again based on this experience."
<<<<<arrived to find that the car I had booked wasn't available because they only allow pickups in the morning. Please explain this a little more. It can't be correct that they only allow pick-ups in the mornings.
"I agree that Post #197 is a little bizarre to me. I rent cars a lot and have never run into this situation where certain cars are only allowed to be picked up at certain times. I'd need some more information to assess this. Saying this, there are several posts on the Vancouver forum, going back 2-3 years, about a possible scam involving excessive charges on unreported defects, which were charged to customers who didn't inspect their cars very well before leaving."
"Yeah, it actually happened twice and the first time I assumed it was my mistake. The second time (the one mentioned in my post) I reserved on line and called twice to make sure the reservation was correct. (it was wrong the first time I called so I called again the day before to be sure and it was wrong on my reservation that time too. ) No idea what's going on but the service was horrible. The only solution offered was a much more expensive vehicle."
That's not what you stated in your initial post - you stated cars were only allowed to be picked up in the morning. What type of cars are allowed to be picked up only in the morning?
"As I stated ""...arrived to find that the car I had booked wasn't available because they only allow pickups in the morning."" This is what the agent at the pick up location told me. It is not what was implied by the registration system which allowed me to select an afternoon time or by the phone agents who twice allowed me to specify an afternoon pickup. Car type was not specified. I agree it's bizarre, hence my huge dissatisfaction."
"Well, if it were me, I'd probably call their customer service line and report it. https:/…"
"It does seem bizarre that an airport car rental office only allows pick ups in the morning, even though the company systems allow you to select later pick up times. I'd be very interested to know what customer service says. Please keep the thread updated with their response."
I had an awful experience with BUDGET- Cayman it's my second time renting a car at this location the first time it took them 2 days to send an email to my bank to release the hold as i had paid by cash. The second time the hold was on my card for an extended period of time i called and it was released but what got me extremely upset was the fact that i was charged extra for not making the needle pass F and when i sent an email querying why i was charged i received no email i sent several emails to the general email system and also the manager and no response to this date keep in mind they responded previously from those emails when i had the issue with removing the credit card hold!! I however phoned them today asking about the charge on the car i rented in Sept 2nd time and queried on the charges she stated it was because it wasn't filled up pass the F but i said no one told me about that charge a charge of $50 should be made aware to the customer at initial sign up. the service at Budget is AWFUL and a disgrace! I would not recommend them to anyone!
If you are supposed to bring the car back with the gas tank full I suggest next time you fill up the tank rather than worrying about the appearance of the gas gauge. In some cars the gauge will go past full before it is totally full.
"In the interest of ""balance"" - I rented from Budget this past week in Phoenix, a personal trip. At checkout, I actually had to stop by the Fastbreak booth (their frequent renter program, free to sign up) because my credit card information needed an update. I received a car in the class I booked at the exact price I was quoted on my reservation (email). There were no upcharge attempts and I brought my car back Full (I showed the check-in agent my gas receipt). I will definitely consider renting from Budget in the future if they meet my budget - but I do compare ALL companies when considering a booking - and I only book directly on the rental company's own website."
I too have recently returned from Florida albeit Tampa Airport. I had prebookef my car rental with Budget through ebookers. I was asked by Budget agent if I wanted to upgrade which I declined and also roadside assistance and personal accident insurance which I again declined. The female agent then printed out the form and asked me to sign and initial. I asked her if I was signing only for the things I had already prebooked through ebookers. She replied yes. Having booked car rental previously with Avis and never having any problem I stupidly trusted what had been said and signed the form. On getting back home I found that i had been charged £160 approx for roadside assistance and personal accident insurance which I had declined. I still had receipt of the agreement and it had been put that I'd accepted these.Ebookers were great and tried to liaise with Budget. However Budget refused to make any concession despite ebookers and my own personal emails detailing the incident.I realise I should have not trusted what was said in conversation with the Agent and not signed the form. I will never ever use Budget again. If you do make sure you have someone with you to witness what is being said and check and double check the form no matter how long the queue behind you before singing. Don't get caught out as I did and get a wee nasty surprise when you get home.
No need for a witness. Just look at the paperwork you get when you rent the car. All the charges are listed there.
"Unfortunately this seems to happen often with many different rental car companies. It's not limited to Budget. The solution, as Hawkeye points out is to review the paperwork. I admit I don't read the entire contract, but it only takes a few seconds to review the charges and see if extras have been added."
"Had a replacement car from this company, Ft Myers FL; had it 18 hrs. After return was billed $75 for 'burns'. We don't smoke. After repeated conversations with three different managers we were assured that this billing error would be corrected. It never was.Do not rent from this company."
"On the 25th of November 2014 I hired a car from Budget rent a car at Brisbane domestic Airport. I then drove to the Sunshine Coast where the car was primarily parked in underground, secure parking for four days. I returned to Brisbane on November 30 and returned the car to the Airport drop off location. The car was signed in by a Budget staff member, there was no damage and I was given a receipt for the total hiring charges of $240.On the 11th of December I noticed a pending charge of $2890 on my credit card from Budget rent a car. I rang the Budget 1800 number and asked what this was about and they put me through to their insurance claims department. The insurance claims department told me that this was excess due to damage caused to the car in a hailstorm in Brisbane on November 27. I explained that I returned the car completely undamaged and I wasn't even in Brisbane on November 27. I informed them that this would be easy to prove as I had stayed in a hotel in Noosa (personally checking in on the 25th and out on the 29th) and with the limited number of kilometres that the car had done it couldn't possibly have traveled between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast more than once. Budget's Insurance department assured me they would look into it and get back to me by email. On the 18th of December, despite having yet to hear back from the Budget Insurance Department, I noticed that a second charge of $2840 had gone on to my credit card from Budget rent a car on the 15th of December. I now had nearly $6000 worth of fraudulent charges on my credit card from Budget rent a car rendering my credit card all but useless to me. I rang Budget head office in Sydney on the 18th of December and left a message for someone to please get back to me. Later that day someone from Budget head office rang and explained that they would take one of the charges off my credit card by faxing the bank but the second charge would remain until the insurance company had looked into my claim. I pointed out that this was not my claim but a false charge carried out by them.Later on the 18th of December I received an email from the Budget Insurance Dept telling me that the charges would be reversed but it would take 5 to 7 working days.I believe this is completely fraudulent behaviour by Budget rent a car to charge me not one but two lots of excess when in fact there should have been no charges given that there was no damage to the car and the car was actually checked in by a member of the Budget rent a car staff, in my presence, at the drop off location. During my first phone call to the insurance department I was informed that 700 cars had been damaged by the hailstorm - it appears Budget were just billing everybody and billing some of us twice."

I ll be sticking to having a witness with me next time I collect from a car hire firm albeit it will never be Budget again ! that as well as reading through the paperwork.
"Generally I like to give companies an honest chance to figure things out, but working with Budget Rent a Car has become absolutely ridiculous. Here are the series of events:1. On 12/16/2014 I reserved a rental car with Budget. They were great at charging my account on 12/17/14 for a total of $177.90. 2. On 12/16/2014 I promptly cancelled my car rental online just hours after making the reservation. I never received a confirmation email of the cancellation so I took the extra step of calling their company and canceling via phone. I received a confirmation email of the cancellation. The email stated that the rental amount minus $10 would be refunded to my account within 7 business days...3. Around the end of December I still had not been refunded the $. I called Budget again and was told that a form was never submitted by the Budget employees for my refund. I thanked the service representative as they gave me a case # and told me that they would complete and submit the form. 4. Around the beginning of January I still had not received a refund. I called again and was told that the form had been submitted but they were unsure why I still had not been refunded. I was told they would look into it.5. On 1/20/15 I called AGAIN. I asked to speak to a supervisor this time. The supervisor told me I could expect to see the refund within 3 business days.6. On 1/23/15 I finally saw the refund. However, they only refunded $50 instead of the $167.90 I am owed!!!It has been over a month since I cancelled my reservation. I am incredibly frustrated with this company and the way they have handled the situation. I feel helpless that they have yet to fix this correctly and upset at the number of times I have had to contact them so that they might follow through with what they advertised."
I completely agree with being ripped off! Sales rep was horrible. Zero stars for this company!! Prepaid online and my actual bill was 4x that amount when I was billed
"Bad experience with Budget. Zero stars for this company. Started in Anasco, Puerto Rico where the rep was chatty about life and not all the extra charges on my bill, their computer system was done and he said he would email me all the paperwork with receipts, that didn't happen. He wouldn't tell me my final price. Dropped off the car in Aquadilla, no signs on where the company is actually located, had to ask airport security where the office was, no signs out by the road to say where to park the car. Their office hours said 11pm to 5am, but there was no one there until 2am.  Prepaid online $180 for a week....awesome price!! Ya right, was over $485 when it was said and done, which I did not know until I emailed customer service. Sales rep told me insurance was 24.99 and my receipt says 33.99...per day. When I contacted customer service they basically say oops sorry. Won't use this company again."
"AVOID BUDGET CAR RENTAL SERVICESI rented a car for couple weeks in Prague Budget.cz in November 2014. When I was returning a car they registered two small scratches that seemed to be new one:1) 1 x 1 mm barely noticeable scratch on the windshield, probably from the small stone, this kind of scratch just can’t cause any major repair like the windshield replacement. It’s usually fixed, if fixed at all, by filling a scratch with a filler. Such repair should not exceed $30-502) 1 x 8 mm scratch on the left side at the very bottom under driver’s the door, almost on the edge to the bottom of the car so barely noticeable as well. Repainting such spot can’t cost more than $30-50 either. I have to notice that prices above are for USA. In Czech Republic they usually 2x lower. I also need to notice that car initially had more noticeable registered scratches when I rented it.Now imagine my surprise when in four weeks upon returning a car, when I already was back to USA, I found that Budget.cz charged me $1000 (additional to the rental cost). When I called them they confirmed that was the cost of the repair of those two scratches. Complete cost as they explained by the phone. Not only no one had contacted me before this charge (they had my phone and email), but one would expect to pay only deductible when car is insured, right? And car was of course insured, and my payment included insurance portion as well. I asked them to send me electronic copies of the documents confirming such expensive repair. It took few days to get one letter issued on their corporate blank of Budget.cz saying that repair had a cost of 800 EUR. No paper from body shop, no detailing on the work done, and parts used. Nothing. Well, I sent them another letter asking for all those details. It took them 5 (!) weeks to reply again. Reply occurred after I complained multiple times to the BudgetCustomerService.com. BudgetCustomerService.com initially opened a file, but then closed it as only they learned that I have a communication with Budget.cz. Anyway, in their last reply Budget.cz acknowledged that the initial charge of $1000 was “too high”. They also sent an electronic copy of the paper from some body shop in Prague claiming that they replaced a windshield (~450) and repaired a scratch (~$250). So Budget.cz has returned the rest $300 to my credit card. Very nice: - no explanation how the initial cost happened to be “too high”- no explanation why they charge me the full amount of the repair instead of the deductible- no explanation why they decided to change the windshield (I doubt they did change) instead of using a sealer- no explanation how repainting of a minor scratch (I doubt they did) could cost $250; for such cost they could of repaint half a car at least in Czech RepublicNote that I received ZERO help from the . BudgetService.com worldwide either. Now both BudgetCustomerService.com and Bufget.cz do simply ignore my further questions – no reply.Of course I disputed the charge with Visa. I should of be doing that from the very beginning. I regret that I wasted a lot of time communicating to them. Just thought that in European country I should be able to resolve such an obvious fraud attempt with their customer support. I’ve been so naïve."
"I rented a car from Budget Rent a Car at Auckland airport, New Zealand in Jan 2015 to attend a funeral in Auckland. I can not believe the horrible service I received. I chose Budget because it was the cheapest price when I searched rental car companies but later found that that included a lot of hidden costs! I thought I was renting a car for $138 and ended up paying $240!!!We returned the car and a couple of days later were called to tell us there was a scratch on the UNDERSIDE of the bumper which there were going to charge us to repair. I asked for photos of this damage and was angered to see the damage is barely noticeable and not seen unless you bend down and look UNDER the car. They wanted to charge me $550 for the repair but thankfully I purchased the excess reduction cover for $29 (Excluding GST - another hidden cost) and it cost me $300 excess!! Budget were rude and didn't even have the decency to discuss the matter.So we paid a total of $540 for the rental of a car for a few hours. Biggest sham I've ever seen so DON'T USE BUDGET! They are not budget prices, just budget service!Edited: 5 years ago "

Post #220 Reported for Solicitation/Advertising.
"Watch out: I was the subject of sharp practice from Budget car Rental Austin Tx. Having booked on-line for a car that my 21 year-old daughter could drive, I was informed that she could not just be a named driver, but would have to rent it herself and as she did not have a credit card, this would not be possible. We therefore had to change our travel plans such that we would now drop the car off at San Antonio airport 80 miles away. The ""helpful"" assistant said that would be no problem and even gave us (incorrect) instructions where to drop it off. She failed to amend the rental agreement however, and I failed to check.. I was subsequently charged $300 extra. I protested this extra charge to no avail. Be warned. I will never use Budget again."
"Kevin....Your post is impossible to figure out. What is the ""sharp practice""?21 year olds, and everyone else, are required to have a credit card and DL to rent a car. There is also a fee ($27?) for 21 year olds.The fee and dropping it at a different location is probably where the extra charges come from.Again, it's hard to respond as what you write is difficult to understand.Edited: 5 years ago "
"hawkeyetough88: For someone who had difficulty figuring out the ""sharp practice"", in my opinion - you nailed it! Agree - all changes and charges appear to be fully explained and justified.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Just found out today that Budget car rental charged us almost as much in fees after our trip as we were for the original charge when we booked budget car rental through Expedia. I should have looked more closely at the paperwork before signing but after waiting an hour in line because they had no cars and being clearly mislead by the price of insurance, I signed and was on my way. We were quoted an amount for insurance which ended up being a daily amount not for the week. This was NOT indicated in anyway by the sales people at the desk who quickly have you sign everything and leave. I called customer service who told me only that it was a legitimate charge. I will not be recommending them to anyone."
"<I should have looked more closely at the paperwork before signing >No matter who you choose to rent from next time, I hope you follow your own advice. In addition, consider signing up for their frequent renter program (it's free) and avoiding the lines altogether."
"I prepaid for rental and full insurance for a car at Glasgow Airport. I gave my credit card as it was standard practice as any damage would be put on the card and I'd claim it back on the insurance with the booking agents. Even though the representative at the rentals desk acknowledged i'd already paid my card has been debited for extra insurance. Do not use Budget, certainly not at Glasgow airport unless you want to get scammed !"
AllTake my advice and DON’T ever go near “ Enterprise Rent A Car” to hire a car. I booked and paid for a car for my 26 year old son who has a full licence and 8 years driving experience. I paid by credit card. On the morning he was due to collect the car I rang to make sure everything was in order. I was told that he could not collect the card unless he had a credit card of his own. He is attending University and naturally doesn’t have a credit card. No-where on the booking page on the internet did it state this before I booked. I then rang and asked when would the money I paid them be returned and was told I would have to ring their office in the USA as it had nothing to do with them. I rang the number they gave me in the US and they say it has nothing to do with them and they have given me another number. I am still trying to get an answer as to when I will receive my money back. They have no concept of customer service and they give the perception that tough luck we don’t really care as we have your money. Never again will I use them and take my advice you shouldn’t either.
Brian....The credit card requirement is rental cars 101. Basic stuff. How did you book and pay for this reservation? On the Enterprise site or elsewhere? Where was this reservation for? What city?Was the reservation refundable? Many prepaid reservations are not.
"Brian F: I'm having a hard time understanding how you signed up for TripAdvisor today - to post your complaint - but instead of starting your own thread on Enterprise, you attached it to the end of a Budget Car Rental thread. It's confusing."
"From the Enterprise website:What are your renter requirements?All Drivers Must:· Meet the renting location's minimum age requirements.· Have a valid driver's license.· Have a major credit card in their name at the time of rental with available credit. In addition to the anticipated cost of the rental, an additional amount may be required."
"I had a terrible recent experience with Budget last month. I picked up a Car in Philadelphia and returned the car in Toronto Ontario. I picked up the car at 1 am and dropped at 11 pm the same day. I WAS CHARGED FOR 2 DAYS at CAD$ 300 each. Even when I confirmed with the dropping location in Toronto that they received after hours returns, they and Budget still charged me for 2 days because they only ""Close the contracts"" at 7 a.m. no matter at what time you drop the car and no matter that there is the parking entrance ticket that has the entrance our. RIPP OFF! Stay away from Budget. ENTERPRISE is better!"
"Horacio C: Honestly, you can rent from whoever you wish - and I'll do the same. But, if the contract terms and conditions which you signed or checked off on when you checked out the car - stated that all contracts were closed at 7am, when dropping after-hours - then I see Budget enforcing their contracts. Ticket stamp or no-ticket stamp. Again, I've always seen these things noted on the contract or the website for a local office. As for claiming Enterprise is better - Brian F. in post #228/229 apparently seems to disagree with you."
"We had a similar Budget Rent A Car experience at the Las Vegas Airport. Our reservation was made thru Costco and that process was very satisfactory. However, upon arrival at the airport Budget counter we were subjected to a hard sell for additional services. The counter agent was arrogant, and attempted to bully us into taking additional services. We have rented many cars over our business career and have never experienced this type of treatment. In the end, it is the consumer's responsibility to use good judgment as to their needs, but if renting from Budget at the Las Vegas airport, be prepared for a hard sell. Also, be sure to carefully fill out the Vehicle Inspection form in the garage noting all damage, especially windshield chips which are difficult to see in the dark rental car garage. The garage agent noted it upon return and checked our ""yellow copy"" of the form to verify it was noted by us. (It was not noted by Budget when we rented)."
My husband and I just got back from Florida. We rented a car from Budget. When we picked up the car we had a car next to us and could not see everything on the car that well. We thought it looked good but when we got to our hotel we found that there was a dent under the passenger door. You could not see it in the garage due to the car next to it and it was not that good of lighting. We called budget right away at the hotel and took a picture. When we called they said not to worry about it and that they had taken note. When we dropped off the car they said they knew nothing about it and we had to fill out a report. I don't know how all of this will play out but it concerns me. We were honest and said something right away.
I sometimes sget out at the exit booth and do a walk around there.
"hawkeyetough88 : That's some very good advice, since the area around the booth is generally better lit up."
"Budget clearly used underhand sales techniques when completing our car hire paperwork, presumably aware that someone coming off a long haul flight just wants to get the car and get away without checking the small print.We were asked if we wanted sat nav, upgrade as she thought a Ford Fiesta would not be large enough for two people?! which we declined. Also which fuelling option we wanted.She imputted this and handed over the paperwork to initial 'here, here, here and sign here'. At no point was Personal accident and effects @ 6.95 a day [ already covered ] Emergency Sickness Plan @ 5.00 a day [ already covered ] Roadside safety @ 6.99 a day [ already covered ] EVER mentioned. This instantly doubled the hire charge by adding 160.00 dollars to the credit card bill just received today.Reading other posts it is clear that this practice is employed by Budget regularly. We visit Florida regularly ourselves and for the first time we found Budget was the most competative quote. Had we had good service we would have stayed with Budget this coming June, no chance now! Have they ever considered that by not robbing their customers they would retain their custom and profit more?"
"Shady practices indeed and I don't blame you for avoiding Budget on your next trip. However, these shady practices are reported from other companies as well. So It is best to read your contract before accepting the car no matter which company you rent from and no matter how tired you are."
"The charges on the contract are not in ""small print""You must question, or look at, what you are signing and initialing. Look at the total at the bottom of the page. Look at something. Anything."
"DiSherburn: As a TA member for almost 8 years - there is a wealth of information here on this forum - posts (which you found) and Top Questions, which you apparently did not. If you had, before you booked, chosen to look at this Top Question on Car Rental tips, you no doubt could have saved yourself a lot of hassles.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12290-k8063412…Some of the adviceSign up for frequent renter programs. - Why? Because you can often skip talking to a human at all and pick up your car directly. Incidentals - The friendly sales representative at the counter may encourage you not to worry about gas because the rental agency can always fill the car up for you if you’re short on time. But you may want to think again, because the agency’s rate per gallon is typically a lot more expensive than you’ll pay at a gas station.Also, say “no thanks” to the toll pass, GPS system, satellite radio, roadside protection, car seat or any other service that they offer to make your trip more “comfortable.” If you don’t say no, you will pay.Again, I'll state what the previous 2 posters have - ALL rental companies upsell - especially in a tourist destination state like Florida. If you care about your trip and your money, you read carefully and ask questions. BTW, I am not buying your argument that the agency targeted you because they knew you were coming off a long haul. That argument makes zero sense to me.Edited: 5 years ago "
"I have heard the argument from Brits on the Florida destination forums that they are targeted, but there are numerous complaints from Americans too. If I am not mistaken there is a class action lawsuit against Dollar Car rental."
"I prepaid for an intermediate car - A Dodge Avenger with a full tank and additional driver. I prepaid so I wouldn't have to spend much time picking it up.However - the guy that served us tried to rip us off at every moment. We've just had a £124 bill for an upgrade we did not want or agree to.Apparently Dodge avengers have been discontinued so why is it on their website? Our sever tried to get us to upgrade to a convertible for $18. I asked if it was a one off payment - he said yes. It wasn't - it was per day. Im glad I asked him a few times so I caught him out.I said I just want a car similar to what I had paid for so I wouldn't get any extra charges, and can we look at pictures/lists of our options - apparently they don't have such 'lists' so had to trust him with what he was giving us.When it came to pay, it was on a keypad thing - as I was not familiar with the set up, I asked about sections I did not understand and he skirted over sections I queried so I wouldn't ask too many questions. Even the part where it says it was charging me money - he just said it was money I had already paid for so I just need to sign it.After a 8.5hr flight and it being around 2am my time I did. Not realising he had conned us by charging us for an upgrade we didn't actually get!!!In their small print it states if your chosen car isn't available, and there isn't one in your chosen category, they will upgrade for free - so again, why was I charged!!He also sold us extra insurance - a $6.95 one or $11 one. I asked 4 times for the $6.95 one yet he put the $11 per day insurance on my bill. I had to point this out and ask for it to be removed.These people are shady and will take you for anything they can get - BEWARE!!!!"
"I extended my rental for one day and they tripled my rate, it went from ~150 to just shy of 300!!! I will never rent for Budget again!!!! What a ripoff it would have been cheaper for me to get it for a week!!"
"<it would have been cheaper for me to get it for a week!!>Then why didn't you choose a week?? Seriously, there are some more valid topics in this thread on upselling, being careful about Terms & Conditions, etc. But, almost all car rental companies charge significantly more for a last minute change. If you knew you needed to extend it, then call before picking it up. Drop the car and shop around for the final day. So many options."

"We received a notice from Budget Rental Car that we had incurred a speed violation...evidently we were monitored on a police video camera going 38 in a 25 in downtown Washington, DC...possible I suppose but I'm suspect I could get that speed on busy city streets...but can't fight city hall..the complaint I have is that Budget charged a $30 handling fee on a $100 violation..that's 30%...certainly a fee is in order since Budget paid the fine but 30% handling fee is just to bilk the customer out of more money...way out of line for a handling fee...this may be standard for rental car companies but I'll definitely not use Budget again!"
Maybe a better idea is to not speed. I think every rental car company charges fees for tickets incurred and I doubt it's a percentage of the fine. They have the same work regardless of the amount of the fine.
"<Maybe a better idea is to not speed.>Hey, that's what I was going to say. Seriously, instead of flying back to dispute this in court, they pay this fee directly and transfer it onto you. The value of that service would be the airfare. For $30, I think you got it cheaply."
"We have just returned from Cyprus having hired for 8 days, a Budget car. We found the service and quality of the car below all our other car-hire experiences of the big companies, including Budget, where we have used them in South Africa. In summary: a rather indifferent reception from the airport desk at Larnaca airport, where the gent was inclined to speak 'at' versus with you; insufficient advice about directions in and out of the airport to / from the common city destination; many scratches on the car; an engine that was surging up and down on revs; no hatch-boot cover to cover luggage etc in the back; and a driver seatbelt that did not wind back. An unfortunate experience against a superb experience at the Annabelle Hotel for which we gave a very positive review."
"My wife rented a Ford Explorer from the Budget car rental at the Flint MI airport on June1. When she picked up the car, she had to wait as they were very busy, and there were no cars. So the car she was given was fueled up, washed and brought out to her by the wash guy, in a dark, unlit lot. The next day her sister was looking at the car, and noticed a molding around the front bumper was loose, and mentioned this to her. As it was a day after she rented, she really had no option but to keep driving the car, which she did, until the molding came loose, and fell off.She then drove the car back 75 miles to the same rental lot, and received a new car, this one is very good shape. As she was leaving, she noticed the rental company employee who was driving her old car, doing donuts, or peel outs with the car she had been driving, and thought to herself ' no wonder their cars are in such bad shape'!When she turned in her replacement car on July 5, no mention was made of the old car. then on July 27, we receive a letter, stating that since she signed an insurance waiver, we were responsible for approximately $2000 of damage, parts replacements, paint, etc.After calling budget for two days, and not getting transferred to a supervisor, she finally was able to talk to someone, who reduced that amount to just he part that fell off.We are still trying to get a resolution, but beware, if you rent a car from the Flint MI airport Budget Car rental, they will rip you off."
"I also had problems when renting a car from Budget at SFO. I denied the insurance options as I am covered between credit card insurance, AAA, etc. When I got to SF and parked the car, I discovered a flat tire. I called Budget to let them know I would be dealing with the flat. They advised me NOT to use my services/insurances, stating that they needed to deal with their roadside service due to their responsibility level for the car - no charges mentioned. The tow truck arrived 2hrs later to find no spare - the car had a 'low run tire' so he could do nothing. After several calls to Budget deciding what needed to be done, the only option given was to exchange the car - and I was 'to stay with the car' until the exchange. SIX hours later, I got the exchange. Budget then charged me for the service and did not refund me for the day lost without a rental. They refused my requests to waiver the charge or refund the lost day."
I learned something. I currently have a reservation with Budget and after reading the above post and reviewing the T & Cs I see that roadside assistance is my problem unless I purchase the supplemental roadside assistance from them. I always thought if there was a flat tire or mechanical problem the rental company would either fix it or provide a replacement vehicle at no cost to me.
"Despite me telling my son to shop around and check the small print, he still went ahead and booked with this company for a weeks car hire in Malta. He ended up paying double for the insurance (it was optional, but he didn't check) and for an additional driver ( for his girlfriend who, being under 25 was ineligible to drive the car anyway) He has learnt an expensive lesson... read the small print, check with the local forum for reputable car hire firms...and any company that calls themselves... ""bargain"", ""budget"" or cheapo""....... isn't."
"Yes, they want you to buy their services. However, I had my own coverage, which I wanted to use and was told, when I called Budget to let them know I had the flat and was going to call AAA, that I was NOT to do that....that they would handle it. Given that their own tow truck could not handle the problem due to their being no spare and that Budget decided the only option was to exchange the car (which would have had NOTHING to do with AAA or insurance coverage, I should not have been charged and should have been refunded for the day lost without a car to use."
"This is a mysterious piece of renting a car that I was totally unfamiliar with. I think I am going to start a separate thread, to see if I can get more replies."
"I fully agree with you that Budget employs abusive practices, and gives incentives to employees to try to extract as much money as they can from you at the desk...I rented, and not only did I have to wait for 30 minutes to get my car, because they were out of midsize cars, and did not offer to upgrade in order to get me on my way...rather I waited until a compact arrived, and gave me the lesser car!!!When I asked to speak with a manager the guy said that they had no manager at that location, and when I asked for his name to file a complaint he made up a name of a soccer player, pretending I would not notice.....while I waited this same person asked another attendant about how much money he had made in comission by convicing customers to upgrade, and get full coverage!!! The person´s name I later found out was YOEL....I hope budget can learn from this, and I recommend renting from HERTZ, since I never had this happen before with them!"
"Budget rent a Car in Bangor, Maine is the worst ! I pre-paid on Priceline.com for 7 day rental for 218.00. Flight was cancelled in NYC and got into Bangor next day. Was told reservation was no longer good because I was late and then he said good news is we have a car and it's 712.00 for 7 days and sign here like he knew I was coming. I said no and just wanted a one day rental of 79.00 and I would book thru Enterprise for 199.54 a week. He then said he was out of one day rentals and then proceeded to turn lights out on his counter desk and I had to catch a cab at 1:30 A.M. Worst rental experience I ever had !"
"Budget/Avis car rentalCHARLOTTE, NC, CT91100 W CRAIGHEAD RD,CHARLOTTE, NC 28206 Reserved a small 2wd Ford Escape SUV $130.00 w/taxes (through Kayak.com), received a 4dr Chevy Malibu for $164.00. Read several recent reviews stating the same switch-up and overcharges at this location. Thought such was just a glich for one person giving a bad review, not so. This location is scamming customers!!!!! Please share with any friends or family traveling to the Charlotte,NC area."
"It sounds budget but it is not so in real. I rented a car last month in Austria. After returning the car I received an invoice where many charges were included which were not mentioned to me when I rented the car. It included a charge for fuel, inspite of the fact that I filled up the the tank before giving it back. After a long exchange of words the company returned the charge for the fuel but not the others. So be careful when you rent any car from this company as it may cost same or less (who knows, and will save your time and money for calling them)at the end of the day if you go for a so called ""non-budget"" company, at least my experience tells me so."
"Rented a vehicle through Budget.com for a vehicle in BWI Airport - Hanover, MD and prepaid. When checking in, check-in was slow and numerous people in line. At my turn, customer rep ask the usual if I wanted the insurance, etc. and I informed her I wanted nothing extra. She then had me push buttons on a small screen to accept I was declining items. Then gave me my bill. My mistake I didn't read the bill because she had added that I wanted some type of emergency road side assistance as an add on that I found when my credit card bill came in added an additional $109.98. Naturally I called when I found that and was basically told you signed the agreement. Clearly, I won't ever use Budget again but if anyone else is contemplating using them, I would strongly recommend you not push any buttons or sign anything until they give an exact total of what you are accepting and then look at the bill before leaving regardless if it holds up everything going through all their fine print. I should have searched the internet before renting from them as this practice of adding in charges seems pretty common with Budget. Another-words, renter BEWARE!"
"The practice happens at other car rental companies too. The better advice may be review your contract no matter what company you rent from. Simply avoiding Budget may not solve your problem, although I can understand why you would not want to use them again."
I belong to FastBreak/RapidRez - Budget's frequent renter program - it's free to join. I push no buttons and sign no contracts. I pass the line and head to my car - my price is always the same as my quote.

"You, CityCarRentals person, are an idiot.You have a member name and pic of CityCarRentals but tell us your cousin suggested you use them?You have just gave us all a reason to NOT use CityCarRental. Fool."
"Rented a Budget car at Warsaw in Sept. for 7 days. It was the wrong car and slow to be delivered and we were late to pick up another driver. At the first bend there was a grinding noise coming from underneath the car. And it increased every time we went over a bump as we drove across Poland. By day 4 a warning light came on the dash but there wasn't a manual to tell us what it was. We contacted Budget Warsaw who told us it was low tyre pressure. After checking, it wasn't and by day 5 we decided to return the car to Warsaw rather than continue with a mechanically unsafe car. They were shocked and I asked for a 2 day refund as I hadn't got what I paid for. I was told to contact Budget Australia which I did and after over a month of slow responses they denied my claim and said the Ford car was mechanically sound and I should make a claim through my booking agent, the usual fob off. I will never use Budget again and I advise all readers to do likewise."
"Hi, I am a single, young female traveler on a tight budget. I chose to rent my car from Budget as I read reviews online that said they were one of the few companies who did not charge additional fees at the time of pick up. I called to book my car a few months ago over the phone and was quoted approximately $170 US included underage driver fees and all coverage. I specifically double check with the lady on the phone that this would be the FINAL amount and that no additional charges would be added at the time of arrival! She said this was the case and I would not be charged any extra.I was to pay on the phone with credit card, however, your service was down and the lady gave me a 20% discount (Bringing the price to approx $153 US). HOWEVER! When I arrived this morning to pick up my car I was told it would be $290. The man behind the desk informed me that there was NO WAY that it would have been $153 with underage coverage etc included. I have no phone so was unable to show him the proof that this was the case. He told me that there was no possible way that I would have been sold it for this price. By this point I was 2 hours later then my leaving time (As when I called to book the shuttle service the day before I was told I could not be picked up, another issue I have as I had to catch public transport hence being late), and had no choice but to pay and get on the road. I have since logged back on to the budget online and checked that I was indeed quoted $153. I have taken screenshots of such.To put into perspective, this is an ADDITIONAL $150 Australian dollars. I am a backpacker and CANNOT afford this sort of cost. I chose your company as I have used you before and have found you to be reliable and respectful.I have contacted Budget 5 times since this with no reasonable resolution. When I picked up the car I was told that I had to have coverage because I am under 25 and if I did not sign the rental agreement I would not have been rented a car. I was backed into a corner.Basically I have been punished because on TWO occasions during my booking and then pick up of car, I was told incorrect information by Budget, yet they are saying it is my fault.Never go with Budget, they don't accept when they are wrong and have made a mistake on their end. They are unwilling to assist when this is the case. You WILL lose money!"
"Liz.....You don't say where you rented and for how long. But, the underage fee is usually about $25 per day. So, $170 seems very low unless you were renting for only a day or two."
"Sorry about the lack of detail. I rented from Las Vegas Maccarren Airport for 2 days (Hence the lower cost), earlier this month!"
"In that case- $170 for 2 days at LAS is very expensive. So, I would think that price included the fees too.Do you have an email confirmation with the fees and total price?"
"What all exactly was the $170 to include? The car, Insurance, young driver fee...more?What were you charged for at LAS that they say was not included?"
I just got off the phone with customer service and in regards to my car rental UPGRADE the car stunk awful and was not smoke free!! With the location being 2 hours away - I did NOT have the time to return it or I would of!! We basically only drove it when we had to other wise we drove our daughters car cause with the air on the smell really bothered us. Your compensation for a $100.00 upgrade that stunk was $25.00 I feel that is NOT fair!I had limited time in CA and did not have the time to come back - exchange it etc.. I have NEVER had issues like this with your company or any other car rental company!!
"rad313: Just to let you know, you are not talking to Budget with your post. I've never seen a Budget rep on these forums - any of them. So, if you expect a response, other than your rant/complaint and opinions from others, you will not get it. Personally, with any of my rentals - I'm careful about my personal inspection of the car, before driving it off the lot."
"In April of this year we took a family trip to Cabo requiring two cars. We had a great experience with Budget. So much so, that when we returned in October, we booked with Budget again. This time we had the worst experience. When booking the reservation I followed the same protocol asking to pay up front for the car to avoid the insurance issue. Whoever the woman was that I talked to made me believe that I was not going to have any trouble. UNFORTUNATELY, that was not the case. Upon arival we found that we ended up in the same scam forcing us to do yet another timeshare presentation just to get the cost of the car closer to what our original quote was. We lost three hours of our already short vacation/long weekend. I am seriously reconsidering using Budget ever again because of it, even if in the states, where timeshare scams do not exist. Bummer that April was so great because I thought we'd found the solution to this annual issue."
"I dropped the vehicle back off at the Budget at BWI airport early one morning before there were any employees on duty. So, there was no one there to verify that the fuel in the vehicle was on full or to give me a final receipt. A day later, I noticed an additional charge on my credit card and called Budget’s customer service. I was informed that I was charged for fuel because the vehicle was not on full and that I had been charged for XM radio. Luckily, I kept the receipt from when I put gas in the vehicle that morning and the customer service representative I spoke with informed me that the charge for the fuel will be removed upon receiving a copy of this receipt. However, he stated because I had signed the contract accepting that had the XM radio charge, I couldn’t be reimbursed for it. When I was at the counter picking up the car, I was asked if I wanted insurance but never asked if I wanted XM radio. Yes, it is my responsibility to read the contract info before signing, but I never been charged for any option without being first asked if I wanted it. I find it deceptive that I was asked about the insurance but never asked if I wanted XM radio. Furthermore, if asked if I would have wanted XM, I would have declined this option but how would it have been turned off in the vehicle? I definitely won’t be using Budget again and want to warn others to be sure to ask if you’re being charged for any other features before signing a contract. I’ve searched the internet and found that this practice of adding in charges seems pretty common with Budget. BEWARE!!!"
"I checked Budget website in Australia to book a car. Website said ring Bunbury direct - can't book on-line. Rang Bunbury Budget arranged a rental, and got confirmation e-mail. Then 24 hours later (and one day before booking date) got another e-mail saying ""can't take credit card payment over the phone"" therefore booking cancelled. No phone call, no alternatives, no options, no apology. It left us stranded in country Western Australia, 500 miles from home. Appalling service."

"I reserved & pre-paid for a rental out of the Akron Canton airport. Because my flight arrived after the closing time I called before reserving the vehicle to inquire as to whether they would stay to give me the rental; I was assured they would and they put my flight information into the system. I know this was done because when I called on the day of the reservation to again confirm someone would be at the counter to assist me my flight information was repeated to me. Upon my arrival at the airport, at midnight, there was a sign on the budget counter saying go to the Avis counter. There was no one at the Avis counter & the girl at the neighboring desk said ""he left"". When she messaged him he said there was no flight information in the system. When I called the next day to lodge a complaint I was told someone from corporate would contact me. With it being the holiday I didn't realize no one did until the following Tuesday. When I spoke to a customer representative I was told that she wasn't sure why someone would tell me they would follow up because the counter closed prior to my flight arrival time. I replied maybe because they thought Budget cared about such a poor show of customer service & would be interested in attempting to right the wrong. Clearly I was wrong. DON'T RENT FROM BUDGET IF YOU HAVE A LATE FLIGHT OR YOU'LL BE STRANDED AT THE AIRPORT!!"
"You wont be stranded if you arrive during hours.It's unfortunate an employee told you someone would be there and then they were not. That is bad service. The last available time at both Budget and Avis is 11:45pm.I wouldn't expect to be able to get a car if I arrive at midnight or later....Budget, Hertz, Alamo, or any of them.Edited: 4 years ago "
"It seems like nothing's changed at Budget. The original post here is dated at 2013. I rented a car from Budget at Chicago O'Hare in October 2015 and had exactly the same issues, but I got ripped off much worse than the OP here.I too arrived after a long flight to collect my car, and was presented with a contract and told to sign and initial in various places. I already had a prepaid voucher, and the staff member never mentioned anything about extra charges, so you can imagine my surprise when I got my credit card bill a month later and found they had charged me an extra $658!! My $400 rental car has now turned into a $1000 rental car. Apparently I had agreed to a $200 upgrade along with various other things like use of the radio and private medical insurance, none of which I needed, nor was I asked if I wanted them.So congratulations Budget, you managed to scam me to the tune of $658 and I guess the staff member received a nice little commission for that one. But rest assured I will never be booking with your company ever again."
"I am sure after that experience you will never book with Budget again and I don't blame you. However, as has been posted on this thread numerous times simply avoiding Budget may not solve your problem. Many other rental companies use the same tactics. A better solution to your problem may be reading your contract before you leave the counter. No matter how tired you are after a long flight you need to take a minute or two to review the charges or risk being ripped off again."
"We rented an economy car at Budget (2nd ave and 9th st) for our weekend trip to upstate NY, it was a pleasant experience overall. The car is well priced at Economy class, clean, new and enough to fit all 5 of us, the rental location is perfect, we could go all the way to LGA or Newark for cheaper price but the transportation time and cost might have evened out the experience.The only thing you need to watch out for when renting at Budget is the gas receipt, always bring back your receipt of the last pump. We were busy saying goodbyes at the fuel station and forgot to take our receipt, that eventually costs us another ""Budget"" gallon (which is 16$).I would definitely rent at this location again."
"I recently rented from Budget at LAX. We were driving down the freeway at night when another car honked. We rolled down the window. He said my tail lights were out. Later we were almost killed before we got the hotel since other cars could not see my car. When I returned the car the next day, Budget refused to adjust the bill. I also called their corporate office which also refused to make an adjustment. I would never rent from Budget again. They obviously do not care about their customers' safety."
"I'm not sure what sort of monetary adjustment would be in order for non functioning tail lights. Certainly it's a safety issue, but I don't see why that would translate to monetary damages."
5 minutes and a $1.00 fuse would have probably fixed the issue.
"On January 8th, my friend and I rented a car from the Budget Car Rental for 11 days to drive around Costa Rica. When initially signing the contract, we specifically asked for the lowest insurance package they would provide, the LDW package. Whether it was due to pure deception or miscommunication because of the language barrier, I was charged with paying for the insurance package that includes not only the LDW, but also their PAE and SCI package. A package that is around $500 more than what we had planned on spending. Being excited to start exploring, I quickly looked over the receipt and signed on the dotted line, assuming that my rental car representative had indeed listened to what I had asked for. The currency in Costa Rica is colones and at the time was around a 500 to 1 exchange rate for the dollar. Factoring that in, seeing the receipt and the price on it (which had no currency sign next to it and I am happy to provide the receipt to prove that), nothing stood out to me. A few days into our trip, I checked my bank balance to see if the charge had gone through and that is when I noticed I was charged an obscene amount of money for an insurance policy I specifically did not ask for. At the end of our 11 days we returned the car (in the exact same condition that we had received it in) and tried to get an explanation for the excess charge and figure out a way to remedy that mistake. That was not the case. We were told in broken English, which is no ones fault, just another factor to overcome, that once we had signed the bill, that was what we were going to pay. We again told our rep (who was the same rep that we had dealt with originally) that we specifically told him we wanted the cheapest package. Ultimately we did not come to any remedy and were given an email and phone number (which did not work) to contact. Once home, I called customer service and told them what happened. After being transferred to a supervisor, we politely explained our situation. After a few minutes of us being completely courteous, he hung up on us, all before we could even ask him what his name was. I WILL NOT BE USING BUDGET AGAIN."
"If you specifically asked for LDW, then the amount of $500 for 11 days seems about right, according to this travel article - and add the mandatory amount - so $40 plus or minus - per day. costa-rica-guide.com/travel/…If you stated that you wanted the minimum required by law, that's different. You are not clear in your version of the story, what you asked for. Anyways, judging by this thread (almost 300 posts) and the one in the local CR forum - you are not alone in feeling you were wronged. I'm just not sure if you were, because I was not there. tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g291982-i813-k3966…"
"Worst experience ever. Beware what they quote you before you pick up the car. Had an original statement that almost tripled in price when i picked up the car, because their ""online quotes aren't always accurate"". Triple the price???? And guess what, when my credit card came back there was another $100 added on because I returned the car an hour later then what I had signed up for. Place was still open, but $100 for showing up one hour later than how I had scheduled it a week and a half prior. I wish for someone to tell me I'm crazy and that I was making these numbers up. $500 for one weekend folks, before the gas I put in myself."

"DO NOT RENT BUDGET RENT A CAR. NO TO BUDGET NO TO BUDGET NOT TO BUDGETRecently, rented a car from Budget out of Denver for 5 days. Upon returning the car and inspecting the car no damages were visible. However, one month later (1) I received a letter from a collection agency stating that I owed almost $900.00 in damages and fees. I had never received any paperwork or calls or emails stating that there was a damage issue to the car. When I contacted the first Budget agent on the phone he said that was an error and it showed no money or issue owed to Budget. A few days later I received a call from Viking Collection Agency stating that I owed money. When I called Budget's corporate office to dispute this claim they gave me the run around. I then called Budget Denver and they said it was a right bumper issue. I asked why didn't you tell me that the day I brought it back. We walked the car checked the miles and gas, I saw no damage to any part of the vehicle. They said it was not the attendants job to walk the vehicle and note any issues. When I called Viking back to dispute the claim they were rude and disrespectful. Basically, they said good luck but we're going to get you and this money. The issue is why didn't I receive forewarning about this alleged claim, why did a collection agency send me the first info on this and why was there such wishy washy answers to the claim of damage. It's a he said, she said issue here. The cars at Denver airport were being parked extremely close to one another I noticed as I was walked toward the bus transport. Perhaps, one of the attendants did the damage since it wasn't there when I parked it. I have gotten my insurance involved to dispute along with me writing a dispute to the Corporate office and to Viking. Good luck out there. My advice is: Take a video of the car when you pick it up and when you return it. Mail that pic to yourself so it has the date of taking the car and then when you drop off the car. If anything does come up you'll have evidence. NO TO BUDGET. Rent from a company that does that inspection immediately. I thought this was a scam but it seems Budget is the one scamming the customers."
"Took a trip to Orlando Florida and rented a car from Budget. After picking up our luggage, wife and I headed down to car rental central. Most rental counters had a few people in line and when we arrived at Budget, there were many. There were six representatives but we waited one minute shy of one hour before it was our turn. Saw many looking for other rental companies and I was looking myself but at this late stage, it was almost impossible to locate one with the same price so suffered in line. We did get upgraded from an economy to an intermediate but really didn't help as I was too upset to feel satisfied. Note to self, sign up for whatever car programs that are available as many are free and you can bypass the lines."
"Roy, You mentioned joining the club to avoid the line. That is one of many suggestions in the top question ""Car rental tips"". You may want to read some of the other tips for saving money and reducing the chances of a problem. Here is the link in case you can't find it.https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-…"
"<Note to self, sign up for whatever car programs that are available as many are free and you can bypass the lines.>Agree 100%. I cannot remember the last time I spoke to an car rental agent at any agency - to actually get assigned a car. Perhaps if they've pre-selected a vehicle I didn't like - but then you can use their FastTrack desk agent."
"Hate budget worst experience ever they offer to upgrade for free and then they charge you double and when you tell them that you were double charge they laugh and said, well how the hell you thought it was for free! Worst scam ever I felt abused and deceived! Worst experience when you are trying to enjoy a vacation! DONT RENT BUDGET EVER"
"Worst experience ever! They offer to upgrade for free and they ended up charging me double, and when I called costumer service they said it was obvious that it was not for free so I ended up paying double, so disappointed and deceived, I thought I was getting lucky with the upgrade I was so stupid to think they were honest and a serious company! NEVER EVER RENT AT BUDGET"
"Veronica, I think a better lesson for you to learn is to read your contract before you sign. Budget did this to you this time, but it could happen with any rental car agency. It is important to look at the charges so upgrades, insurance or other unwanted items are not inserted into your contract before you leave the counter. Also look at the recent posts about joining the company's club so you don't even have to deal with an agent.I am not condoning what Budget did, just trying to make suggestions for you to protect yourself in the future."
"I rented from Budget in Florida. After the trip I received an additional bill to $75 for 'burns' in the vehicle. We are seniors, are responsible and don't smoke. I complained and manager after manager assured me that I would be credited. It never happened. The process took longer than a year and passed their 'statute of limitations' on complaints. Never again."
"We rented a car from Affordable and paid for it using our Tesco vouchers. On arrival at Boston Airport, we had to collect our car from the Budget desk. We asked to hire a SAT Nav system & the man behind the desk offered us an upgrade for a small price each day to a car which had a built-in SAT Nav. Imagine our horror when we got home to find our credit car with a bill for £168 payable to Budget. All sorts of extras added without us being aware of them & Affordable both tell us that there is nothing they can do. Both companies are rip-off merchants who just ruin people's holidays. Avoid them like the plague! Karen & Jeremy Norman"
"This is standard procedure for Budget, they add on as many extras as possible and hope you won't notice. I guess they make more money this way than they lose through unhappy customers who will never book with them again."
"hkboy09: Are you still commenting on your October 2015 rental, which you posted (#282)? I rented from them once again in mid-January. Never spoke to a single Budget person - no addons, no hidden fees, no upsells. The rate was as quoted and used my Fastbreak number."
"Nightmare at Fort Lauderdale airport. Late arrival, long line, no cars. Our ""upgrade"" was a Grand Caravan, not the compact thatt had been reserved for us. We were told that we could exchange it at any Budget Rental while on our journey, but it turned out that none of the smaller locations wanted to be stuck with a Grand Caravan. When we were finally able to find a place to exchange it the local franchise owner said this is a constant problem. Corporate Budget has a habit of overbooking cars, and letting the local dealers deal with all of the unhappy customers. He also told us that when you prepay, you are guaranteeing a price, but not a vehicle."
"It is true with every car rental company that you are not reserving a particular car. I had success one time with Hertz giving me a price reduction when I complained half in jest that I would have to spend more in gas for the suv they had for me. That was at a small outlet in downtown Austin, Tx., probably not the norm."
"bk-11: Yes I am, and it is clear that from reading here and other forums that mine is not an isolated case. Budget may not be the only company that employs these deceptive and misleading practices, but they seem to be the most often complained about. A lot of countries have laws to stop this kind of deceitful behaviour, apparently not in the USA though. So whilst there's nothing I can do to get back the money they ripped off from me, the least I can do is try and warn other people of what goes on in the hope that it might save someone else from suffering the same fate."
"Hkboy,Since you acknowledge these practices are widespread, not limited to Budget I think if you really want to educate people you should steer them to the general tips for dealing with every car agency. I don't know where you get the idea that there are more complaints about Budget.Reading these forums I disagree that the problems are isolated to the USA. I have read horror stories from Europe and other parts of the world too."
"I agree - upsells are not isolated to Budget and there are far to many other agencies in the USA and globally which are continually reported here and on local forums. Fox and Gold are two which I see equally or more often. In my mind, the way to stop them is to belong to frequent renter programs, which are all free to join and allow you to view the Terms & Conditions of your rental, in advance. If you are somehow ""forced"" to speak with a human, then ask questions and read ALL things which you sign. Not much harder than that."
"recently {march 1 2016 rented from budget} booked 2 months in advance for 9 days and paid in full, 1 month before arriving I called to cancel 1 day, canceling was no problem but could not get reimbursed for the 1 day, so I said well if I cancel the whole reservation there is no charge and they agreed. now this is where it starts to get weird, if I cancel and then rebook for 8 days instead of 9 there would be an approximate $200 increase in cost, so I was going to just cancel and book with national cause that's whom we usauly use but wife said we would just bring car back 1 day early with no penalty so to save the hassel I agreed. I was booked for a full size car, I received a kia that I barley could get in cause its so low to ground, fount an attendant and he looked at paperwork and said ""take it or leave it"" so we ended up taking it. It was very uncomfortable but we both {seniors} endured the ""go-cart"" even the valets at the casino laughed cause I literly had to crawl out of the go-cart. Then when we brought it back I was questioned cause it was a day early and attendant said he was not sure if he could except it, I laughed at him and said ""the keys are in it, you signed off so just leave it here blocking the others for a day"" walked away and the attendant was just standing there with his mouth open. I will never rent from Budget again!"
"poppa....It's rarely a good idea to prepay for a car rental. Since prices change, sometimes daily, you almost always over pay. Especially months in advance. As you discovered prepaid bookings are not refundable and changes are not easy or free. Early returns are not always free of penalty. You may be charged for it.As to the size of car- I wouldn't have took a little Kia.Edited: 4 years ago "
The problem is no one from Budget follows this page. How can we actually create a dialogue with management?Edited: 4 years ago 
<The problem is no one from Budget follows this page. How can we actually create a dialogue with management?>Geez....and I thought the purpose of the posts was just to rant and claim one would never use Budget again? I guess I was wrong. Budget is not hiding from having conversations with anyone. Their contact information is here - 2 clicks on Google:elliott.org/company-contacts/avis-budget/
"My goal is to never have a conversation with Budget. If they are cheapest when I am looking for a rental I book online using my Fastbreak number and get my car without any conversation. I check my contract before leaving with my car to make sure the numbers are right. Budget, Alamo, Dollar all seem about the same to me."
"Thanks, I will give this a try, heeding this caveat from the page: ""If you contact the company by email, you should receive a substantive reply within one week. If you don't, it's safe to assume you're being ignored. Before you reach out to one of these managers, please review these FAQs, which will increase the odds of a successful appeal."""
"We have just returned from Florida and €237 yes €237.00 was taken from our bank account from budget car rental. We booked through rental cars.com. We complained to them but they said it looks like we got extras. My wife and I were at the budget car rental counter together and the only thing we were offered was a satnav which we declined as we had our own. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THESE RIP OFFS. rental cars advised us to contact our bank and report the unauthorised withdrawal which we are doing now. Its stealing as we didn't authorise this and we defiantly did not have any extras. THIS IS OUR 11TH TRIP TO ORLANDO AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF. WE WILL NEVER BOOK WITH RENTAL CARS.COM AGAIN. AND NEVER AGAIN BOOK BUDGET CAR RENTAL AND ADVISE IF YOU DONT WANT MONEY STOLLEN FROM YOUR ACCOUNT, DONT BOOK THESE. there are plenty of other car rentals in Orlando airport choose one of them. MICHAEL WAS THE NAME OF THE BUDGET THIEF WHO TOOK THE MONEY."
"NO NEED TO SHOUTunhappychappy....First, your post will probably be removed. You cant come on here, name employees, and call them a thief. You were given receipts and a contract when you rented the car in Orlando. What does it say? Are there ""extras"" listed there? Did you accept and sign for any extras? If so, there is not much you can do now. If the ""extras"" are not listed on the contract- you have a legitimate dispute.Edited: 4 years ago "
"unhappychappyIreland : What is the reason for ""shouting""?? As stated, there is no one from Budget reading this and like most people - no one does there research in advance - so your ""warning"" is pretty much meaningless for the next customer who actually might. It appears you have a lot of travel mishaps - maybe you should consider booking direct with travel providers and not using 3rd party OTA's? Just a thought."

"Dear unhappy,I understand your frustration with Budget's deceptive practices, but there are reports on these forums about many other car rental companies too. The solution to reduce some of these problems is to follow Hawkeye's advice and review your contract before you accept your car. It sounds like you have been lucky in the past, but that doesn't guarantee you won't have a problem in the future no matter who you rent with if you don't review your contract.If the credit was issued as quickly as the timing in these posts indicate I have a hunch it was some sort of hold on the account rather than a resolution of disputed charges. I don't think credit disputes normally get resolved that quickly."
"<Some people must be in bed with budget rental cars and think it's fine to take money that they shouldn't.>Truly laughable. A poster sees an alternative point of view, and all of the sudden we work for the company. I could say the same thing here - you must work for the competition? As stated by me and others - we don't. We travel, we read the T&C's, we read things we sign."
"Ladri!!! In Irlanda mi hanno fatto firmare un'assicurazione che non ho chiesto, anzi avevo specificato di non volere!!Mai più con Budget, sono dei truffatori!"
"Another unhappy budget customer at Orlando Airport. I made it very clear that I did not want any additional insurances (but would want the sun pass). The agent was very friendly and said sign here, initial here and confirmed that no extra insurances were added. After along flight I just wanted to get on my way so did so. Car was fine, no issue. Next morning read through the contract in more detail and sure enough two insurances had been added (about $120) - one was for sickness and the other personal accident. I am covered for both on my travel insurance. These were not explained to me and they were added despite me saying do not add any additional insurances. My real complaint is that I phoned budget customer services to ask for them to be cancelled for the remainder of the booking. Budget customer service (sic) said ""we can't help you with that, you will have to go back to the airport to sort it out"". I didn't want to waste precious holiday timer going back to the airport so I followed up with an email and got a similar reply. I have escalated it within budget but have little hope of getting a decent reply. I know that I should have read the contract in more detail before signing but when I clearly said ""do not add any insurances"" I just want the package I booked with rentalcars.com I honestly think that should have been enough, especially as the agent said that no additional charges were added. I guess other rental companies are similar but I won't be booking with Budget again.Read contracts carefully if you choose to do it"
"I have been trying to find a place on trip advisor to post a car rental review since returning from my holiday in South Africa in January 2016 and getting no satisfaction from Budget car rental. Looks like this is the best place to warn other customers? I rented the car at car rentals.com before I left. The price stated was $392.I took out extra insurance separately .When I collected the car at the airport, I was told that the price was $540. After a lengthy dispute, they agreed to upgrade my car to a bigger vehicle if I went with the $540 price. I eventually agreed as I need the extra space, When I returned the car , they asked me where the trunk 'liner' was. I stated we did not get one when we received the car. They asked us to sign and indicate it was missing when we picked up the car, on the contract. We did so. When we got home I checked my credit card statement- $940 charged! I have tried unsuccessfully to challenge this outrageous charge for the past 4 months. Budget North America refuse to help me- they say it can only be sorted out from South Africa.The vendor in SA claim the extra for the 'missing' trunk liner- which is billed at $156. None of the numbers add up and no one is prepared to take responsibility!! When I asked for the paper work, they sent me the bills for repairs that had been done to another vehicle with a different registration number rented in a different city!! I am at my wits end! I will never use Budget again!!"
So an interesting update. On a point of principal I escalated my complaint to Avis Budget GroupExecutive Resolution Coordinator and to my pleasant surprise that agreed to refund my additional charge. Do not give up. If your complaint is valid and justified then keep escalating until it gets resolved avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us/…
"I have never in my entire life dealt with such horrible customer service. After driving their car for approximately 20 minutes it broke down in an extremely bad neighborhood. I called Roadside Assistance and was told a tow truck would be there in an hour to take me to the nearest airport to get a replacement car. I told them I had an extremely important work event, the reason I rented the car, that I could not miss. I was told there was nothing that could be done and they refused to send someone to get me.After an hour passed and still no tow truck, I called back and was assured the truck was “around the corner”. Another hour passed. I called Customer Service Management and was told I would be refunded for my trouble, I wasn’t. I had to call them after I saw the charges appear on my card a few days later to have them removed. After another hour passed I called Customer Service again and spoke to the rudest Customer Service Manager I have ever dealt with. I told him it had now been close to 5 hours, not only had I missed my meeting but I had to get home to get my children. He couldn’t care less and quite rudely told me that “Budget doesn’t have any type of service to pick up customers”. After waiting for 5 HOURS there was no exception that they could make to help their customer, a single female, in a bad neighborhood who had waited 5 hours. I was basically told I should have gone with Enterprise. Throughout the whole experience no one from Customer Service ever called back to check on me or see how I was. If I hadn’t called no one would even have verified if I was ever picked up.After waiting SEVEN HOURS I finally took a $200 Uber ride home, where I had to pay an extra $100 to my babysitter. I spoke with a Customer Service Agent a few days later who after telling her my story, made NO attempt to apologize or offer any type of reimbursement for my ride home or discount on future cars to keep me as a customer. No one throughout my entire Budget experience made any attempt to apologize or keep me as a customer. Oh, and the tow truck called me at 9pm (my car broke down at 1pm) to tell me he was there. Budget had zero problem with me, a female alone at night, broken down waiting 8 hours for a tow."
"Positive review!! I am a Canadian vacationing in Sydney. I recently rented a Budget car at their Alexandria location on Bourke Road. When I returned the vehicle, as expected, they looked over the car to determine whether any damage had occurred during the rental. The Budget employee noted a small scratch on the fender which evidently had not been there when I rented. It was small but visible. Possibly it happened in a parking lot. I did not carefully go over the vehicle when I rented it. A little lesson there for me. Anyway, the manager, Chantel, explained the process and said that Budget looks at the past 10 rentals for the vehicle to determine whether the damage had been previously reported. The next day Chantel advised that Budget could find no record of any damage to the vehicle, but nevertheless it could be fixed without charge. I was extremely impressed both by the outcome as well as the high level of service I received from Chantel and other members of the Alexandria branch. I will definitely recommend this Budget location."
Never Again!I canceled a reservation one month ahead. Budget charged me a $10 penalty fee for canceling!Corporate greed is a terrible thing.

"Agree, Budget ripped me off. Higher fees and car wasn't what was promised. Never again."
Total rip off. Agent in Albuquerque misrepresented the fees and the car. Never again will I use Budget. I fly and rent cars several times a year.
"Agree with you...I travel a great deal, so let me save you some time. Budget Fort Lauderdale Airport is awful. Do not rent here because if you have any issues they are incompetent at best. For starters, I politely refused the rental agent who annoyingly tried sell me on up-sell me on layers and layers of insurance and anything else he could think of to increase the ticket. Even though I told him I was covered. He pushed hard on me renting a Maserati, too. Seriously? Then, I found out when I turned the car in, that he signed me up for the fuel purchase option, when I emphatically told this rental agent ""No thank you."" This took me two days to straighten out over the phone (just try and get a real person the phone from Budget , good luck.) But it gets worse, I unfortunately left a suit jacket in the backseat. I called back 20 minutes later, (so it was still there) to report it on Saturday May 7. No one would picked up the phone or would return my message, even though they claim they are ""manning the lost and found phones from 9 am to 6pm."" I finally talked to Budget customer service Sunday May 8. They checked and told me that the car had not gone out and I should be able to get any contents back on Monday. So I called first thing Monday May 9. No one answered. i left a message too. After several hours I got someone to pick up the ""manned"" phone. Aaron talked to me in the lost and found department. He said he would go look for the jacket and call me back. He never called back, he did mention the car was still on premise. It is clear that the coat was removed by an employee and not turned in, someone kept it. The lost and found department is just window dressing for the public. if you actually leave something in a vehicle, someone at Budget keeps it for themselves. Don't ever use Budget FLL. You have been warned."
">>>>""I travel a great deal""<<<<<<< ... >>>>>""I politely refused the rental agent""<<<<<What were you doing talking to a rental agent? If you rent cars often you should know to join the company's club so you don't have to wait in line and avoid the upsell and bait and switch."
"Just want to forewarn everyone to read and check the contracts on picking up your vehicle. Take the time to read and check every item and make sure all is correctly marked before initialing...I just returned from my vacation, but prior to leaving had reserved a medium size SUV, did all the paperwork, only getting what I needed, NO GPS, satellite radio, extra insurance etc. Just the daily rental + taxes. I had reserved my SUV about 3&1/2 weeks prior to leaving. As others have stated, they rush you through a very confusing ""contract"" saying initial here to decline. I had received several emails and texts reminding me to pick my vehicle up at the time indicated along with ""you can add GPS, satellite radio and more with just a click"" which I did not do. Upon arriving I was told my ""SUV"" did not come to the location that day. I could wait and get it when it showed up. OR...They did ""just have a returned SUV bigger than what I had reserved, if I wanted it, it was an upgrade and I would have to pay an extra amount for it ($77+). If I did not take it, they had no clue when another SUV would come in."" Standing behind me were two families also looking for an SUV. So a fast decision was to be made, I take it or one of the other families would. In the past, when I have rented from Budget, if my chosen vehicle was not there, I was given the upgrade at no extra cost to me. However this time, I was told, no free upgrades. Even though it was not my fault my vehicle did not come in, I reluctantly said I would take the one they had.. Upon returning from vacation I looked at the contract closer still could not make out what was going on with the costs.I called customer care and talked with them telling me about my experience on picking my SUV up, and they said that I was not charged for the bigger vehicle, that I had taken out insurance.... my question or comment to her was, Why would I take out the insurance when my personal insurance covered what they sold me. After about a ten minute conversation I was told that that charge could be taken off but would have to get it done where I picked the SUV up. Upon returning the vehicle, once again had a 15 minute conversation. I did get refunded the $77+ (which I will make sure when credit card statement comes in), but the man still insisted I had agreed to it and didn't really want to refund the charge. I had reminded the man that I had talked with Customer Care and they told me I would get the refund and after my husband said we were going to put out a review he finally said, ""well, you did agree to the charge, but I will refund your money.""I feel a lot of pressure is given at the time of pickup and they rush you through the process and if you cannot understand the bill, so many like me just initials and signs where they tell you to. AND they tell you one thing and it appears different on the contract like ""I'm going to charge you for that"", but not knowing how to put it down just puts it anywhere. No place for a free upgrade, so just put it down as insurance!And the two families behind me... one left to go to another location and the other chose to wait until a SUV came in...It boils down to the fact that the salesman didn't know how to add the up-charge so he just put it down that I had purchased insurance. Two wrongs does not make it right. I don't know if all locations do this, but this was my experience with the Franklin, OH location."
"May 2016 Again Budget car rental seem to be making news for the wrong reasons. Arrivibng at Denver after an overnight flight I was told that car I had booked did not have 4 wheel drive so I would have to upgrade. I couldn't get online to confirm and needed to hit the road so accepted it. As a result my $350 car cost nearly $1200. On arriving back in UK I moaned to Budget and was refunded the upgrade fee but what they didn't offer were the additional fees that are based on a % of the total bill. The Concession Recovery Fee for example is 11.11% but I never found out whjat it was (Budget ignored my question) and never refunded the extra I had paid. Similarly with tax, of course. When I returned the car I wanted to pay part cash and part credit card but couldn't - and it was a real palaver to find out! I could split the bill over 2 cards but not cash and a card. All-in-all I think their pricing is far from transparent and the service at the desk far from good quality."
"Rogue company!! Do not buy with budget rental cars. They lie on the phone, charge you additional costs and tell you you are signing to decline services when you are actually agreeing to extra fees. Complaints process is almost non-existent. +2 weeks since I contacted them and heard nothing but received additional charges. Salesman was deceitful, telephone staff are useless liars and the company should be closed down."
"My wife went to visit her mother in Pennsylvania in 2011. She rented a car from Budget to get her from the airport to her mother's house, (approximately a 50 minute drive). While visiting, she parked the car out of the way in a grassy area so as not to be in anyone's way and to protect the car from any type of damage. I called my insurance company prior to renting to confirm coverage and to let them know as they required this. During the term of the visit, a thunder storm came up. In the house they heard a loud crack of lighting and the car started flashing it's lights and blaring the horn. The battery was disconnected and the damage was assessed. There was nothing except for the passenger side rear view mirror glass was dislodged and laying on the ground. There were no burn marks or any other damage. I don't know if a fuse got burned out. The car was in pristine condition, but it would not start. Budget came and towed the car and left another one. Much later, months to a year, Budget said the damage was a total loss and that I owed them $34,000 for the car. For the last five years Budget has been adamant about collecting the money. My insurance company assessed the damage from pictures and what they were told and paid Budget what they felt the damage was worth, $3,600.08. They deal with damaged claims on a daily basis. Budget returned the check and demanded the full cost of $34,000. This is without providing a damaged report which was requested several times. Since then Budget has reduced the claim to $17,807.04. They said they received about half from a salvage sale. I would have bought the car from them if they gave me a chance and would have paid the full price. At least I would have gotten something for my money. Instead Budget took the car and now they want the money also. For all I know only a fuse was blown out."
"just like to warn others of hidden charges, I rented a car from munich airport, we had taken extra insurance out to cover any excess but at the airport we had to pay a collision deposit by credit card which was refunded after our return. However, on returning home they had also charged 2.5 percent credit charge on the payment, and another similar fee when it was refunded, coupled with a slight drop in exchange rate it came to an extra £55 I wasn't expected, is this common practice?"

"Booked a car on Priceline and wound up with a Budget Rental car at EWR (Newark). Worst car rental experience ever. Car smelled smokey when I got in it, but not terrible and I was in a hurry so didn't bother going back to get a different one. When I returned the car they asked how it was. I said worked fine, but suggested they might want to do a more thorough cleaning as it definitely smelled smokey.When I got home and was filing my expense report, I realized the EWR counter person had charged me for an upgrade. This was never discussed and I never agreed to an upgrade. They gave me the keys and told me which car to take and off I went. It seemed like a standard car to me, which is what I had purchased.When I called Budget to dispute the charge, I also learned that the Newark office had charged ME a $250 smoke-cleaning fee! Eventually the national office agreed to refund that charge but regarding the upgrade, they said my receipt showed I had signed for an upgrade. I have two copies of the receipt and there is no signature on it. I scanned my copy and sent it to them. They sent me a scan of their receipt and it is not my signature. Someone else must have signed it after the fact.I spent 4 days calling the Budget office at Newark and could never get anyone to answer the phone. At the end of the day I was only out $58 plus a couple hours on the phone, but had I rented for longer or not checked my bill it would have been much more costly. After having such a negative experience, I have been looking at rental car reviews and this nefarious activity seems to be common."
"I want to also add to the dishonest, travesty that is Budget rental. We are currently stationed overseas and just recently went to Charlotte, NC for a funeral and had reserved a car rental with Budget. In the confirmation email we received, the quote we were given for the use of the car, 2 booster seats, and generic taxes and fees was to be around $300. Nowhere was it ever disclosed that there was a fee of over $100 per booster seat to be added (fees that should have been disclosed when given the option to get the seats during the reservation process), which is an outrageous amount of money for a booster seat! This now upped our total to $500. In addition, at the desk, I was given the option to upgrade the car. When I specifically asked what the total price difference would be I was told ""only $5 a day,"" which would only have been an extra $35 total. Somehow in that transition there was an extra $400 added out of nowhere, making our total over $900 for a weeklong rental in the second to smallest car available! When we inquired with Budget customer service where these charges came from we were told only that they were taxes and fees, and given no explanation on what they were fees for, or a breakdown of how they could total an extra $400 on top of what we would have been paying for the smallest car option (which was only about $100 in taxes/fees.) All the major companies have their unsavory practices, but we have never run into anything like this before, and we will never use Budget again, and recommend others not to either."
All you have to do is look at the printed contract before you leave with the car. All the charges will be listed for you to see.
"Interesting. According to their website, for car seats there is a rental fee of $13/day - up to $65 per rental. So, times two is $130. As for the fee breakdown, as stated, look at your contract and the final bill. I don't know about ""unsavory"" - but I do look at my contract whenever I'm asked to initial stuff - and I ask them what I'm agreeing to.....https:/…products.htmlEdited: 4 years ago "
"It's been awhile since I've done a car rental through Priceline, so I can't remember what kind of receipt I got at check in. I would think it would show zero due unless upgrades were added. I would certainly have not accepted a car with cigarette smoke anticipating that I might be charged a cleaning fee.As for the direct rental from Budget I agree with bk and hawkeye. I have never walked away from a rental counter without a receipt showing a bottom line total. I always compare the amount with my reservation. Whether it is shenanigans or mistakes it is very easy to see any discrepancies. Especially if there is an upgrade or any changes it's hard for me to believe people walk away with checking their receipt."
"BEWARE of renting from Budget. We had originally booked a car for a trip in Italy for $611 Canadian but had to change our travel dates. I spoke to a young man at Budget about renting the same vehicle for one extra day. We came to an agreement that I would be charged $611 Canadian total for the 7 day rental. He said that Budget was making an exception and giving me a deal. Then I got an email confirmation. It read Estimated Total: $435.74 , Base rate $1,104.00. Curious about this, I clicked the ""View complete summary of charges"". This took me to the Budget website and there the total price read $1306.03 US.I was in shock and immediately phoned Budget. A supervisor was supposed to get back to me within 24 hours but never did, so I wrote emails with attachments from the original rental agreement and the modified one. After going back and forth three times, of course they did not modify their price and never did explain how I got an estimated price of $435.00 when if fact they were charging me $1306 American. However they did quickly send me another modified contract for $1306.03 American. At that point I cancelled my reservation and got a car from another rental company for one half the price!!!A word to the wise, Be VERY CAREFUL if you decide to rent from Budget. You may end up paying more than you bargained for."
"laura,Congratulations. Unlike many people that come here to complain you actually read your contract and protected yourself. So many others take the word of an agent then are appalled AFTER the rental when they get a larger bill than expected."
"Never use budget!!! they are just thieves that will try and take your money in every possible way and over charge you without even seeing on what.I will make sure to tell my story in every possible forum that no one will do the mistake I did and use budget.I rented a can thru budget at larnaca office airport, I rented it for 3 days for the amount of 370 EURO.Last night, when I returned the car, they charged me for 350 EURO for 2 scratches that appeared on the bumper, claiming they need to replace it and can't paint it(yea right) and it was decided via whatsapp message from the employee in the office at night and his manager, the manager is so talented that he could recognize that the bumper should be replaced and not painted and that the cost is 350 EURO, AGAIN, WITHOUT EVEN SEEING THE CAR!!!Awful experience for me with budget, I am definitely not going to repeat it again and hopefully you will do the same. I am not even talking about the fact that the car was dirty from outside and I washed it myself...Regards, Tuvi."
"I went today to pick up a minivan that I had reserved for a family vacation. I had paid in full at time of reservation several days prior. When I told the clerks my name they told me they had and explorer for me...I have an Explorer, I needed a minivan for this trip. I declined and they offered every vehicle smaller than a minivan...none of which would work obviously. After searching they finally found one at the airport which is 36 miles away from the location I am at and 45 miles away from my home from which we are leaving. So....they gave me a vehicle to drive up to the airport myself and make the exchange. This whole process took 3.5 hours out of the schedule when it should have taken only 45min. I would suggest that if you are renting a vehicle you consider choosing a company other than Budget, one who is either able or willing to fulfill their agreements and willing to get their own vehicles and not send customers to move around their stock."
"Please check your contract very, very carefully.My wife rented a car from Budget, and when she picked it up, the agent offered an upgrade. He told her three times that there would be no charge, but when they put a hold on the credit card, it was for $1356, not the $508 that the reservation was for. My wife's father had died two days before this occurred, so she was in no position to defend herself from an action like this.After 4 phone calls and two visits to Budget offices, they finally did correct what I assume was a mistake. While the person that corrected this was apparently very nice, none of the other people with whom I spoke expressed the slightest interest in fixing this, and one of them actually became somewhat hostile.I have read a number of very critical reviews of Budget's customer service, and now I can see why this is the case."
"in march when budget took 237 euro from our bank for upgrades we didn't want, this is the excuse we got from customer servicewe are still fighting for the refundWe apologize for all your concerns with the additional billing. Weunderstand that when traveling often times our renters are in a hurry tobegin their trip, they may be experiencing fatigue due to long flighttimes, or they are rushed to make their destination. Although we realizestanding at a rental car counter is not how many renters envisionbeginning their travels, we strongly encourage each and every customerto review their contract, ask for clarification if necessary andthoroughly understand what they are signing for. We encourage this inorder to avoid situations such as the one you have encountered.Because verbal communications can sometimes be confusing, the printedrental receipt has all the details needed to support the charges(attached). As you have disputed these charges with your credit cardcompany, we have closed out Customer Service file on this case to allowthem to investigate this for you.Warm Regards,Tena KlammRepresentative | Email Customer Service"
That is a very good explanation from Budget. In fact it is what I and many others have been saying on these boards ad infinitum.
^ ^ ^ ^ +1 przyk : I agree - read the contract. There is no excuse to not read it.Edited: 4 years ago 
"I would guess about 8 out of every 10 rental car complaints could be avoided if the customer would spend 60 seconds, or less, looking at the contract and charges."
"About the only complaints not in this category are, no car was available at pick up time or they got a bill after they turned in the car for damage they didn't cause."

Same thing happen to me. I even made sure that toll operator cancelled the transaction. Only to collect my $0.75 and then allowed Budget to charge me $22.00. this is happened to me twice now. I guess the answer is to tape a piece of construction paper over the window. DUH
"MY STORY:WARNING - FRAUD - BUDGET RENTAL CAR - SAN FRANCISCO INTL APOJEROLD at SAN FRANCISCO INTL APOI entered USA on February 20, 2016 at SF International Airport. I hadreserved and fully prepaid a rental car thru ArgusCarHire/CarTrawler. Atthe Budget counter I met the nicest employee who gave me the rental carin an efficient way and even without trying to sell any extras oroptions. He, JEROLD, just told me; ""seems it is all prepaid for, and youare good to go"". I only had to use my credit card, as is usual, fortheir warranty and eventual fines or whatever that could occur duringrental. I signed electronically on a pad.Only after returning back to Europe the additional charge showed up onmy credit card. I had obviously ""purchased"" some optional insurance for110$. Only later I understood what had happened.The Budget employee, JEROLD, had shown me one printed contract on thecounter without any additional charges but then when I signedelectronically on the pad he placed my electronic signature on anotherrental agreement in the computer that had the charge for optionalinsurance included.I would like to warn everyone of this way of performing swindle -especially if you are going to rent a car of JEROLD in SAN FRANCISCOINTL APOI have been contacting ArgusCarHire/CarTrawler, Budget and Visa over thepast 4 months but I have not been able to resolve the issue yet."
Just look at the printed contract before leaving with the car. Simple. Once back in Europe it's too late.
"They want money that is all. Here is my experience.Upon returning my rental to the depot, the young lady working behind the counter went to gather all the information from the vehicle and gave me the completed receipt. I inquired if all was in order with everything and was told yes. Upon reviewing my receipt, inside the depot with the agent, I again inquired if all was in order and was told yes. My reason for inquiring twice is because upon my arrival to pick up the car the same agent had given me an incorrect rental agreement. Upon reviewing it I made mention and she fixed the error which almost cost us an additional $400. Now I get back return the car full of gasoline, as the receipt shows, and we identified prior to leaving the depot, that everything is good. I now find myself with a gas bill over a month later, for $89.67 and needing to provide a detailed gas receipt after I have provided the return receipt (checked over with the agent and myself prior to leaving) and my debit charges, from my bank, as I have been told by customer service. Three times now I have been asked to provide something different to prove we returned the car full, when the receipt from Budget/Avis identifies that is so. Horrible customer service, lack of commitment for documentation provided to the customer by the business and lack of customer care from the four individuals I have had the opportunity to speak with and no return call from the individual that sent me the second notice."
"I had a horrible experience with Budget , advice to all people hiring a car abroad, NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER use Budget Car Rental, they use multiple scams to try and squeeze money out of you and are ruthless when it comes to extracting the money. This is why they take your card first. DO NOT GO WITH FHEM. I had to pay 3x what they quoted because I was 15 minutes late picking the car up. This ruined my holiday and they would do NOTHING"
"I try to avoid Budget Rental Car whenever I can. I travel frequently and I've only been burned twice with a rental car and both times it has been with Budget. First time was about 8 years ago when they charged me for damage underneath my front bumper. I flew into Washington DC Dulles and had the car for about 8 hours (flew in the morning and left in the evening). I drove the car from the airport to the facility where my meeting was, then drove back to the airport to catch my flight. Well sure enough, they said there are scratches underneath the bumper, I fought as best I could but to no avail; they said you are traveling on government orders, they take care of it...ugh!! So I've tried my best to avoid them, but last week I couldn't, again traveling with the government to DC; this time to National Airport). So I go pick up my car and they upgrade me, well isn't that nice I thought (giving me a large SUV instead of the compact...I know they had more of those than compact, but I still liked the idea). Because of my experience 8 years prior I inspect all cars in detail before taking them. Well I get to the car and it was filthy!! I made a comment but I said I'll take it. I walked around it and see a HUGE dent in the rear right panel. No one was there (Budget representative) so I assumed they would ask me on exiting the parking garage about the car....nope!! He said you are all set and he would have been fine with me leaving, but I said there is a huge dent in the back...ohhhh is there. Ok you can mark it on this paper and we will note it....GOOD THING!!! I bring the car back and sure enough the attendant accepting my car smiles (I kid you not) and points at the dent....Like what did you do here? I said nothing but I hand him the paper and he said oh (again I kid you not). My question is I wonder how many people would just pull out and think nothing of it when they picked up the car. I also wonder how many times Budget has processed a claim for that dent?!?!? But low and behold they did win on me again, they charged me for fuel service which I never asked for (most companies ask you; do you want to bring it back full?). So next time I have to rent from crooked Budget I will look at the contract even closer. Again I'm amazed, I'm not new to traveling (I travel 2 or 3 time per month for over 15 years); but you must watched for Budget, most rental car companies are very upfront, not BUDGET!!"
"<<<<< I fought as best I could but to no avail; they said you are traveling on government orders, they take care of it...ugh!!Things like this really make me mad. I would have, and have, reported comments like that to the insurer and anyone that would listen. I once had a medical device that required AA batteries. The medical device people sent me hundreds of AA batteries. I called them and asked what the deal was. The response.....""don't worry, insurance will pay for them"""
"DAYTON BUDGET @ FAIRFIELD COMMONS MALL (Beavercreek, OH)Worst rental experience ever. Car covered in bird droppings. Vehicle inside was not clear. Returned vehicle and the idiots held my $100 security deposit for a week. The clerk said I had to call the 1-800 number to get my money back. The 1-800 rep said call the Sears location. The Sears location clerk said call this number...it was the home number of a nasty mean female store manager who when I told her I would never rent from Budget again, she said great and started screaming that we call her cell phone. WHAT A PISS POOR COMPANY!!!!Capt Steve Hamilton, USAFDayton, OH"
Never go with Budget... I had a very bad experience recently during my visit to LA. They force you to take additional insurance to a extent that they scare to deny you a rental car.Unfortunately I ended up paying ~$450 more than what I booked online. A BIG NO to budget...
"The Budget office in downtown Florence Italy is a chaotic , disorganized outfit. After waiting an hour and a half for my car I gave up and cancelled the reservation. Travellers beware! Budget needs to get their act together."
Currently at the Denver budget rent car location. HORRIBLE. Big mistake using this company. There are about 100+ people in line to get the car they have reserved. They have only three reps at the counter. It has taken us longer to get a car at this budget location than our flight took from Atlanta to Denver. And worst of all is that budget doesn't seem to care about customer service or helping all of these people in line. Don't use budget.
"Due to a very poor experience with Budget, this will be my families first and last time using Budget. After arriving in Denver and taken by a shuttle to the Budget location, the line was outside and wrapped around the building. It took an hour to get to the counter and the agent quickly told you to sign here on the iPad. We specifically stated we did not want any additional options such as the insurance and certainly did not want to ""upgrade"" for ""only $10.00 additional a day"". We signed the ""waiver"" for the additional insurance but didn't realize until we turned the car in that the waiver is actually ""agreeing"" to the loss damage waiver at 29.99 a day! My total bill came to 255.77 for not a full 3 days. The rental was only 75.00 so the ""waiver"" cost more than the car did. I'm mad at myself for not looking at the paperwork immediately that day but I was already frustrated after being in line for an hour and eager to meet up with my family. I trusted the agent when he told me where to initial and stated you are signing the waiver, believing that declining the additional insurance. We tried to get the issue resolved when we turned the car in with no luck. We contacted the company and after speaking to 3 different people the best they would do is knock off half of the ""waiver"". This company has no commitment to their customers and I will be sure to let every person I know as well as social media of this very poor experience and highly recommend they use another rental company."
You would be stark raving mad to use this company. I hired a car for 3 days from Munich airport and upon my return saw that I had been charged for 5 days. This money was taken out of my account 2 days after I had returned home. I contacted customer support who asked for my flight boarding card which I sent to them proving that I had returned home after 3 days and could not possibly have had the car 5 days. Despite having sent further emails asking for an explanation there has been no reply. Please boycott this company. Car rental company? The sooner they are driven out of business the better
"BigBawheid : Not sure about how you chose the words you did. But if your charges are not justified, why wouldn't you contact your credit card company and protest the charge? That way, they do the investigation and legwork for you. Just keep in mind, that almost ALL car agencies charge for an extra full day if the car is returned after 15 minutes late. As for the rest, it's highly unlikely they will be ""driven out of business"" anytime soon."
Big.....You would get a receipt with final charges when you returned the car. What did that receipt say? 3 days or 5 days?
"We too was charged a few hundred more for items covered by our travel insurance and we did not check before we signed. Our reply was we must have been very tired after our long flight. NEVER EVER AGAIN. With all the complaints of budget car rental, I think it would be impossible for them to stay in business. We rent a car on average 4 times a year and they have lost our custom along with thousands more like us. It's not just the people behind the rental car counter but budget customer service too, they must encourage their employees to steel because at the end of the day, when you are led to believe only the security deposit of 200 is being held on your card, then an extra few hundred is taken for items you already have THATS STEALING."
I had rented a car from Budget back in Febuary for an October vacation to Miami. I flew from Boston to Miami International. The reason I rented with Budget was it was located at the airport which was very convient and I got a good price renting it so far in advance. I indicated that I would be at the pick-up counter by noon. We arrived at 11:45. Unfortunately our Ford Fusion or compatible car was not available upon our arrival. The person at the counter was not very friendly and indicated she did not know when there would be a car available. She offered us a 12 passenger van for 2 people. We were driving to key west and absolutely did not want a big van on this trip. We stood there forever while she just looked at her computer screen making no conversation with us. She was talking to the other 2 people behind the counter iconversing with them not in English. It made it for a very uncomfortable situation. Then instead of telling us that she had a car for us she looked up at us and said take the elevator to the second floor. We said oh our we going to be speaking with someone else and she said no with a discussing tone your car is ready. Mind you this entire time we did not say a word to discourage this women what so ever as we figured if we did we would wait even longer to get a car. We were actually overly friendly under the circumstance. I found out later that this is not uncommon to wait for a rental car. Being the case you need to train your staff to be nicer to the people who have to wait knowing that this is a common issue. You did not give us the rental car for free we paid you money .
I recently hired a budget car from Washington DC. I had the exact same experience. The staff signed me up to extras without telling me I paid an extra $370 for my rental. The lady behind the counter must be on a commission. I thought I could trust a large company like budget ... I was wrong.

"Just returned from a trip to Orlando where we hired a car from Budget for 14 days. Returned home to find they added insurance without telling us, and the guy behind the counter saying multiple times ""you're fully covered nothing else to pay"". He took a swipe of my credit card which he told me was for gas and we were on our way. I was actually surprised they didn't try and upsell us any extras like insurance, tolls or a sat nav but instead they commit card fraud and just add it on anyway! The screens were broken in the airport so we couldn't read what we were 'signing' (a dot was all we could manage). I'm in contact with my bank to reverse the transaction. BUYER BEWARE"
"You weren't given a copy of your contract before you left the counter? I have always received one and I quickly review the charges before I accept the vehicle. Many car rental companies have deceptive practices, so it is always a necessity to review that contract no matter who you rent from and no matter what the nice agent says."
"<<<<< The screens were broken in the airport so we couldn't read what we were 'signing'In which case you should have looked at the printed contract they gave you listing everything they were charging to your card. Checking weeks later once you return to the UK is too late.Like bk. I would never leave with a car without knowing and understanding the contract. If you need to stop at the exit booth to read it- do it. But, once you leave with the car- it's your baby."
This happened to us only I refused to sign it.They said you are not taking a car unless you sign.Still refusing the extra charges they just added on without telling us.She called over her co worker and he had a go as well.We pointed out what we were covered for and were told that was not worth the paper it was written on.We had the car but he told us if we broke down or had a flat tyre it would cost us hundreds.It ruined our holiday as we were conscious for the whole holiday.We have been going to Florida for 30 years and never have this much hassle with the other car hire companies.They always try to get more money out of you but take no for an answer.
"We rented from Budget at the Orlando airport a few years ago. We had proof from our own vehicle insurance company stating that we were covered for a rental car. The young lady behind the counter tried her best to convince us that the rules were different in Florida, and that we would not be protected against injuries to third parties, etc...It sounded very much like an upsell to us. We declined the insurance, she did not press the issue, and there were no extra charges.It did occur to me, though, that had we driven our own vehicle from Canada (which we have done from time to time) we would have been fully covered by our insurer, regardless of the ""different"" set of rules that apparently apply. It's not like drivers from out of state have to stop at the state line to upgrade their car insurance before proceeding into Florida. Or am I missing something?"
It was just an upsell.
"worst car rental agency ever, totally not recommended to anyone, your are better to buy a vehicle then turn around and sell it, the most friendliest and the most unknowledgeable people ever to deal with. worst service ever"
"I feel your pain: If I hadn’t actually gone through the following experience, I would have never believed that it was true, but unfortunately, it is: I made a car reservation at the Newport News airport for November 22nd. My flight was due in at 10:30 pm, but was delayed in Atlanta for a few hours, so we didn’t get in until a little after 12:30. When we arrived at the counter, there was this useless, clueless slack-jaw employee telling us repeatedly that their computers were down. Finally, I had to ask, “What does that mean to us?” She responded, “I can’t rent you a car, besides we close at midnight.” I looked around and saw Enterprise, National and Hertz all renting cars (unfortunately they didn’t have any extras to rent), so why couldn’t Budget? I mean, they already had my information and credit card #. I don’t see why they couldn’t complete the transaction the old way, by writing down whatever additional information they needed and entering it at some point when the computers were not down. But NO! Even more puzzling is why this joke of a company would have an employee stay 30 minutes past closing just to tell customers that they closed “30 minutes ago?” You gotta try, I mean really, really try to have a customer service fail this egregious. Rent at your own risk."
"Budget closed at midnight. You show up at 12:30am and are puzzled as to why you can't get a car? Really? Were you really puzzled? Common sense would tell us that the computers were ""down"" because the business was closed."
"Gotta agree with the plausible explanation from hawkeye88. Add the information about office hours, found here:https:/…phf.htmlI guess if it had been me, and I was in Atlanta waiting for a delayed connection which I knew was delayed sufficiently - I'd have been on the phone finding another option."
"Car rental agencies at major airports are open 24/7, but as you found out the hard way that's not always the case at smaller airports. Why an employee was still there in a visible location 1/2 hour after closing is more of a mystery to me."
I'm sure there are closing procedures that take time.
"hawkeye,I'm just going by my experience at airport rental counters. They usually have a room in back, out of site of the counter, a convenient hiding place."
"Extra unjustified charges after the cars I rented were returned. Very poor costumer service. Would not rent again from Budget –Avis in South Africa.Rented cars from Budget –Avis in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa. While the cars were in good condition and drove well my experiences were very bad after I returned the cars. When I received my credit card statement I found the charges were higher than the one that appeared on my final bill. I was charged extra $35 for the Cape Town charge and $75 for the Johannesburg charge.I called Budget costumer services 12 times over 3 weeks to get an explanation for these extra charges but got little assistance. Only after my 5th call I was told that the extra charge in Capet Town was for cleaning the car, and the one in Johannesburg was for damage to the rear bumper. I was surprised to receive these extra charges because the cars were not dirty and I they were checked upon my return and no damage was noted. I only found this by my credit card bank.I protested these charges and the damage charge was refunded after numerous phone calls to costumer services and e mails.My experiences with Budget-Avis in South Africa were very upsetting and I would never rent a car from them again. They failed to communicate with me about the extra charges and were non responsive to my complaints."
"Budget/Avis Car Rental--never again. We recently reserved a car with Budget through COSTCO which we have done numerous times. When we picked up the car at the Bloomington-Normal IL Airport, the car had a warning light on for low tire pressure. We immediately went back to the counter to find the young lady gone for the night. We called the number on the contract and explained the situation to the agent. She send roadside assistance. When the service tech got there, he found all four tires over-inflated, two by 10 pounds, and two 20 pounds.The spare was over 50 pounds. This is very dangerous. When I said, I would have expected the car to be trip ready, he asked who we rented it from. When I said Budget Car Rental, his comment was ""Well you get what you pay for."" He let the air out of all the tires. We preceded on vacation; but, with the tire pressure light on, we were not reassured we would not have any other issues. When we returned the car to the desk at the airport, I explained the situation and the agent apologized profusely and agreed the car should have been road ready when we picked it up. Imagine my surprise when we received a bill from Budget for over $80 to cover the service call.\. When I called Budget, I was transferred around. Finally, I got a very rude customer service rep. No mention was made of a charge; and, had I known they were going to charge us for the service call, I would have used AAA or my insurance. We will never rent from Budget again."
"Avis/Budget - Excess Rip Off!I wish I had read all these comments before we become yet another couple to be ripped off by AVIS.We were caught on the extra insurance, we rented and payed for the car hire online through another site. The paper said it came with CDW etc. etc. we didn't need this as we always have our own yearly European excess.Some weeks after hiring the car I was very surprised to receive an invoice for double the amount of the car hire! We called them to see why we had been charges the extra amount and found after speaking to someone from there company and reading the small print it is standard policy to add this at the time of hiring the car. We were never told of inclusive EXTRA charges (And who reads all the some print!) We hired the car in Faro airport but this rip off is all over AVIS/BUDGET. So to finish this post, we will from now on read all the same print before signing Also we will never hire a car from any company associated with AVIS EVER AGAIN."
"I've had exactly the same problem with Budget. We,ve just arrived back from Florida. We picked the car up from Fort Lauderdale.We've been to the USA dozens of times and never had a problem with car hire but then again we've never used Budget.Very angry"
I experienced the same sharp practice after informing the agent we had holiday insurance. It was not until we returned home to find both my daughter a I were charged for accident insurance. Contacted Budget who' s response was you signed the contract it your fault you shoul always check your contract. This is very sharp practice taking advantage of people who have experienced a long haul flight and a early start to their day. Not sure how to challenge this now without costing more than the charges.

You are a nasty person :)
How can I be a nasty person when I am stating the truth like other customers before me. I think you need to brush up on your customer service skills and act more proffesional and investigate the problems being experienced by customers. Your reply sums up Budget
I rented in Chicago and the charge for one $1.50 toll was $21.25 charge to my credit card.
"lisbonact: I'm not sure what you are disputing. The Terms and Conditions are pretty clear - sorry you chose not to read them before your trip. https:/…ezpass.html<If you use e-Toll, you will be charged a $3.95 convenience fee for each day of the rental, including any days on which e-Toll is not used, up to a maximum of $19.75 per rental month, plus incurred tolls at the cash rate. There is no charge for Budget e-Toll unless you use it.>"
<<<<<I rented in Chicago and the charge for one $1.50 toll was $21.25 charge to my credit card.Sounds about right if you drove thru a toll.
"BUDGET LIED TO ME AND OVER CHARGED MEI rented a car on 12/22/16 at the Miami airport and returned it on 12/23/16 to the Key Largo location. 1/2 mile before returning the car I filled the gas tank then dropped the car off. When I dropped the car off I was charged a $13.99 fee which, according to the sign on the wall right behind the counter is ONLY supposed to be charged when the customer drives less than 75 miles and doesn't fill up the tank. I informed the counter person that I filled the tank, showed her the receipt and she checked the tank. She then lied right to my face and claimed that the $13.99 fee wasn't a gas fee and that I had to pay it. She would not remove the fee.I called corporate right when I got home and they confirmed that yes, the $13.99 fee is a gas fee and was supposed to be charged only if the car wasn't refilled with gas before being dropped off. They promised a refund and a call back from either a manager or someone in corporate. I have not received either the refund or call back. It is now 12/31/16 and I have called no less than 3 times asking where the refund is and when I will get the call back from the manager or person from corporate and each time they tell me to wait and that it will be posted in a couple days. Each time I wait the couple days and no refund is posted.I rent cars at least 3 times a month with my work, always with National or Enterprise and have never had an experience like this with a counter person who lied right to my face. I've had it with Budget and am going to be doing a chargeback on the rental unless that refund is forthcoming."
"Steve W: No issues with your post or credit request - and I do not know what Budget told you over the phone - but credit card refunds take time when transactions go from bank to bank. I see on their T&C's that some credit card transactions can take up to 7 business days to process. The Christmas holiday shifted some of these ""business days"", so if it were me, I would wait a few more business days. https:/…I travel a lot for business, and just know that sometimes credit card refunds take a few more days. It's your call and your patience."
"My husband and I recently rented a car (December 17th) with Budget Rent a car in Washington D.C. and we feel stolen by Budget. We rented the car for 3 days. So, the day we returned the car, they charged the total amount of the car and insurance to the credit card, but then, 8 days after that they charged us 85$ more for paytolls, I almost got a heart attack. And besides that, 15 days after that they still charged us unknowns amounts from I don't know what. I'm furious for this lack of respect and I swear I will never rent a car with Budget again, and of course I will not recommend my clients to rent with them (I own a travel agency)."
"Who did you think was paying the toll charges you were piling up? What does your contract say? As a travel agent, I'd expect you to know this or at least look it up in advance. https:/…ezpass.htmlWho is responsible for parking, tolls and moving traffic violations? Answer: You are responsible for payment of any parking, toll and moving traffic violations along with a reasonable administrative fee, so please drive safely and observe all ordinances. Payments for these violations may be processed by a designated agent for this purpose. Almost ALL US rental car agencies use a 3rd party ""delayed"" billing system from the various toll authorities - which compile fees and charges later. Budget uses e-toll, but others use htallc.com http://e-tolls.com/So, fine - don't use them. But, my recommendation is to research better next time - so that your clients are not surprised like you were."
"Vick,When you find a rental car company that includes tolls in the price please let me know. I will definitely use them next time."
"I'm not saying that we didn't have to pay for pay tolls, but they must inform that in the moment YOU PICK THE CAR and in ""the contract"" wich didn't have one, they only gave us a receipt with the total amount of the rental and insurence, nothing more than that. In fact, we asumed that we had to open the paytoll e-z pass thing to pay them because no one told us to do it (and of course we didn't know there were so many and that amount!) and the agent who attended us in the Budget counter never told us anything about another expenses more than the gas. I'm only asking that car rental companies must inform everything in the moment you are renting the vehicle, not after and no, I'm no in favor that of they charge things a month after people pay and finished the thing because in that cases you have no idea what are you paying for. The same thing happen in Italy with some little rental companies, a week after you returned the car and everything was good, well, they never give you back the deposit, and you have no idea about the bad reputation they have all over the country due to that.Thank you for the ""advice""."
"So, you didn't sign or initial anything when you picked up your car? Nothing at all? What about the ""folder jacket"" where the agent put your contract? As stated, I've rented from just about every agency out there in the US - and if it is not clear to me - I ask. And almost all of them use a 3rd party delayed billing service."
"This is from the terms and conditions of Budget Washington DC. When you made your reservation you agreed to these terms, whether you read them or not. Again, as a travel agent I am surprised you are not aware that there are standard t &c's that go with every travel reservation. https:/…"
"Budget Rent a Car Experience, PhoenixOur arrival by shuttle to the rental centre went (relatively) smoothly. When we got to the Budget center, things went from bad to worse. The lineup was over 30 people long and they only had 4 stations (out of 10) helping customers. It was mid-afternoon, so it wasn’t likely they were all out to lunch, but it took almost an hour before it was our turn. Suggestion for improvement: When there is a huge lineup of people waiting to begin their holiday, put a few more people on to serve them.Next surprise, the car (Buick Verano or equivalent) that I had booked and paid for with Air miles a month before was not available. How could that be? Suggestion for improvement. If someone books a vehicle, treat that as an unwritten contract that you deliver that car (or its equivalent), when it is supposed to be picked up However, they would upgrade us into a different car. Since it was their error that I didn’t get what was promised, I assumed the upgrade would be complimentary…………….bad mistake. I found out only later that the upgrade (the favour they were doing for screwing up my reservation in the first place) was at an extra cost of 21 dollars plus tax per day. Suggestion for improvement: Don’t make suggestions that sound like you are doing them a favour when you AREN’TThe fellow at the counter was in a hurry. With a long line of people waiting for cars he took no time to allow any kind of understanding of what was happening at the rapid rate he demanded. “Press Here”, “Press Here”, “Initial Here”, Sign here” was most of our conversation. I felt stampeded, coerced and railroaded.I was extremely disappointed with our treatment and with the financial shafting we took. At first I felt I was overreacting but a couple who we casually met on the trip down and subsequently saw again on the return flight said they had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE with Budget. The car they ordered “wasn’t available”, but they would upgrade them, the rushed experience, the lack of explanation, and all the surprises that came after. They felt they’d been processed like cattle.Both of us found the cost of the car (and we didn’t even take the added insurance) was the largest bill we had on our 10-day trip to Arizona. The flights, the food expenses and the cost of 10-nights accommodation at good hotels were all smaller.I, and I’m sure the other couple will never consider using Budget again if this is their strategy and the way they conduct business."

Sure just avoid Budget. Don't join the loyalty program so you can avoid the lines at the counter. Do make assumptions about upgrade costs and just push whatever buttons the agent tells you to. Don't read the contract before you accept the car. As long as you avoid Budget I am sure everything will go fine.
"I had a similar situation renting from Budget in Ohio. I was charged for insurance, 209.99. When I returned the car, it was a surprise to me to find this charge because I always refuse the insurance and I remember telling the representative that I never purchase the insurance. But in reviewing the contract, I noticed that I had indeed initialed accepting the insurance. It is my fault for not reading the contract after signing it. However, I do feel that their practices are unscrupulous and I will never again rent from Budget and I will always read what I am signing!"
"746ellie,Welcome to trip advisor. I appreciate your comments. While you are in my mind justifiably upset with Budget's practices your comments indicate you understand your responsibility to be vigilant about not letting this happen to you again. So many people who come on here don't accept any responsibility for reading contracts or understanding terms and conditions. They just assume this is a problem with one company and if they avoid the company in the future they won't ever have to worry about anyone taking advantage of them again."
"We hired a Budget car from NYC to drive and return to Newark airport. Basic price was $237.12 we understand that the taxes make it more expensive but on return of the car we were charged $508.99 we were charged for an extra day?? On a 4 day rental this seems a little excessive? I call it theft! We were charged for excess insurance but I did not want this and showed the assistant my worldwide excess insurance cover that my business pays for. The car smelled strongly of tobacco smoke the charge for a GPS was $16.00 that was broken , Dont use Avis /Budget I say! I rent cars Europe wide without issues. Will advise staff members friends and family not to use this company again. My complaints were not even considered."
"Wow, $16 for a broken gps. I wonder how much they charge for one that works?I would not accept a car that smelled of smoke. Did you at least point it out and have it noted so you won't be charged for cleaning?Your receipt should show the time you returned the car. That should be enough to dispute the charge with your credit card company. You probably unknowingly agreed to insurance extras, so I doubt you can contest those.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I was in Florida in December and hired a car via argus car hire which I picked up from the Budget desk at Orlando airport. All was fine with the car, but checking my credit card statement a month later and I've been charged $20.75 at Exit Plaza POINC-OFF. I haven't got a clue where that is. so firstly if anyone can help me with this location. Secondly, the vehicle passed this exit plaza at 5:11:55pm on 12 Dec 2016. I have timestamped photographs of my family on the people mover at Magic Kingdom at this time and as I had my phone with me, google tracking also has me at this location. I've only challenged this charge with Budget today, but I'd like to understand if anyone else has had a similar problem."
"Cliff D: Is it possible you went through a toll? If so, then Budget uses a 3rd party to bill all tolls, and there is a convenience fee, as well. This is the case for almost ALL rental agencies I know and it should be listed on your contract. To look up a receipt - here is the link. www.e-tolls.com/Receipt_Request.aspx…"
"Hi BK_ti, I have a copy of the receipt from e-tolls.com. My only transit during the 12 Dec was between my accommodation and Magic Kingdom. I know Budget uses a 3rd party to bill all tolls. My question was where is exit plaza POINC-OFF. Is this near Disney World. And the second part of my question is how could I drive through a toll exit at 5:11 when I was on the people mover in the magic kingdom. Google tracking on my phone and photographs with date time stamps has me at MK too. Very strange. The charge isn't a huge amount, so if I've made a mistake how did I make it and hopefully during my next visit I won't make the same mistake."
"<My question was where is exit plaza POINC-OFF.>I'm going to guess and say this is the new SR-538 - a toll road - also called Poinciana Parkway. I'm also going to take a guess and say that ""Off"" refers to an off or exit ramp charge. Yes, this is south of Disney.https:/…Florida_State_Road_538<And the second part of my question is how could I drive through a toll exit at 5:11 >Again, just a guess - but maybe the time stamp from the toll authority is off. If you feel this was charged in error, then dispute it with the toll authority. https://www.tollbyplate.com/faqThe point I'm making is that Budget off-loads all of this to a 3rd party. So, if you feel you were mischarged, dispute the 3rd party. See the procedure I posted. Good Luck!"
"What a dishonest company! We made a three day car rental reservation in advance. Our flight into SFO was delayed several hours because of weather. When we finally got to the car rental counter we were advised that Budget could no longer honor our reservation because we were no longer meeting the three day minimum for our rate. They wanted to charge more than $100 more than our original reservation, think about that. Because we were keeping the car two hours less they wanted to charge us more than $100 more.. when we insisted it was a flight delay we were advised to take it up with the airline. What a rediculous answer. We asked the agent to assist us in finding a different rate. We could use a AAA, military, AARP or outlet discount. We were told all he could offer us was the walk up rate which was much more expensive. We walked away from the counter, pulled out an iPad and found the exact same rental on Priceline for a total of $99 including taxes and fees. That was $75 less than our original reservation and $175 less than they wanted to charge us because of the delay. We went back to the counter to the same agent and showed him the new reservation. He then spent 20 minutes trying to upsell us and trying to convince us to pay their rediculous damage fees, gas prepay, etc. We could have a BMW SUV for the discounted rate of $50. Fortunately we asked the right questions because it was really $50 a day, not $50 for the rental period. He was relentless. We held firm on our new reservation. He then directed us to the wrong location to pick up the car and gave us the car furthest away. FYI, the agent told us that if you make a three day reservation and return it in less than three days, they would charge you more for the rental. We will never rent from Budget again."
If a company's offering a special rate for three-day rentals it's reasonable to expect customers to comply with the terms & conditions of the deal; otherwise they would have people who only wanted a car for two days using the deal & collecting late or returning early just to take advantage of the offer - dishonest company or dishonest customers? I think in this instance you have no real gripe with Budget - I'm pretty sure you'd get the same response from any other company.Although the delay was caused by circumstances beyond your control the bottom line is that you were unable to meet the conditions of the deal you booked. Sometimes life's tough!
"I take exception to the suggestion that I am dishonest. They had my flight number. I offered to show them my boarding pass to prove that my flight was delayed. I was more than willing to pay for the entire three days as was my agreement with Budget. I was not asking Budget to lower the rate bacause I was only using the car for two days and 22 hours. Furthermore, if I kept the car for three days and two additional hours I would expect to have to pay for the car for the two extra hours at an hourly rate. If I returned the car after one day and paid for the three days as per the agreement I guarantee that budget would not leave the car sitting in its lot for two days because technically it was still rented to me. They would rent it as soon as possible. If you have a counter at an airport and rent to air travelers it is reasonable to acommodate the inevitable delays in air travel that are out of the customer's control."
">>I take exception to the suggestion that I am dishonest.<<Sorry, that was not in any way intended as a slur on you; I said: ""they would have people who only wanted a car for two days using the deal"", which does not of course apply to you. I added that as an afterthought. . . should have realised it could be taken out of context. My apologies if you thought I was accusing you of dishonesty.You were unlucky but, as I said, I don't think you would have had a different reply from other companies so it's not, I believe, a Budget-specific problem. I'm not defending Budget, a company I've never used, just expressing my opinion!Edited: 3 years ago "
"Too late to edit, but I should have said ""I don't think you would have had a different reply from some other companies"" - maybe others would have been more accommodating, maybe not. At one time such a decision may well have been up to the individual agent. Now it's more often than not a case of ""computer says no"".Edited: 3 years ago "
"I don't see how the company is harmed if a customer returns a car early. They got the money for the entire rental period and they have the car back early so they can rent it again.I understand they have policies to cover this, but I don't think it's right. I also know it doesn't matter what I think, lol."
"Worst Experience Ever. Bunch of crooks and thieves. Do not give them a credit card, they will find something to charge you for."
....such as?
I also had a terrible experience and was misinformed at Orlando airport. Told if they fill up car it was the same price per gallon as outside the airport. Reviewed my credit card and they charged me nearly 10 dollars per gallon. Descriptive and fraudulent practices continue many years later!!!!!
"I just rented from Budget in Hawaii 2 weeks ago and had the worst experience ever. I had booked my rental through Costco 3 months prior for $360 for 7 days. On the day that I was set to leave for Hawaii, American Airlines cancelled my flight due to bad weather at LAX. When I called Budget, as a courtesy, to advise them that I would now be picking the car up 17 hours later, they immediately changed my rental price to $665! They charged me an additional $305 for picking my car up 17 hours later. I have spent hours on the phone and emailing Budget but they do not care. The fact that 2 separate customer service agents emailed me the same canned word for word excuse that when a travelers plans change their policy is to change the rental price tells me that they do this a lot. In addition, when I arrived, I waited over an hour and a half to get my car. When I returned my car, the change oil light was on. They agent who was checking in my car got on his walkie talkie and told his supervisor that they would have to take this car out of service for maintenance. I heard the supervisor respond that they needed this car in service (I could see the long line of poor souls who were waiting in line to get a car just as I was 1 week earlier). The supervisor told the agent to go online and see how they could disable or rest the light so that they could immediately turn the car around and get it back in service. I have never received such poor customer service from any business in my life. Budget obviously take every advance that it can to fleece its customers. Shame on you Budget for such dirty business practices. It is a wonder that the word has not gotten out about how rotten iBudget is. I should have checked Yelp before renting, the Yelp reviews reflect my experience."

"Recently I rent an Opel Astra at Santorini. The car we used during our journey to Santorini, has low consumption and it is just the good point of that. All alarm for next service and changing the oil was turned on but the car was not service in proper time. It used old technology and we could not connect our mobile or our music to sound system of the car and we stick to Greek music from radio.The most annoying part was the time of take over the car. The responsible man told me that the car has not full insurance and I need to provide it. He told me that I need to buy Super Collision Damage Waiver (SCDW) despite of the fact that I have already Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and he told me that is on the website and I refused to buy it in first place. I have to decide about it just in front of counter with a queue behind me. When I told him that I did not find this choice in website he told me that he is sure that I cancelled it and I did not notice to website enough. By the way, he charge me 50% more than base price for SCDW. I checked the website and I cannot see the option for SCDW. It could be nice for the company to give us the choice in first place not as marketing issue at counter."
"Renting with Budget was an absolutely horrible experience and a mistake I will never make again. Sorry for the long story but the short version is they are dishonest and incompetent. I reserved a car for a week online and prepaid, this was a Sunday and I had car troubles and hadn't even gotten it to the shop yet so I wasn't sure how long I would need it. I ended up returning it the same day because I found an alternative plan and on my receipt I saw that I was being refunded less than half of what I paid for a week despite only keeping it for 8 hours. I asked the customer service rep why so little, and she said she didn't know, she couldn't help and that I had to call customer service to resolve the issue. I called customer service the next day and was basically told there was a mistake but I'd be charged the daily rate + fees and refunded the rest in 3-5 business days. A week went by and I got nothing, so I called once again and was told the first rep never actually processed it so it would be another 3-5 business days. I asked for a receipt so I would know exactly what I was being refunded and know that it was being processed, because neither the first or the second rep would give me an exact amount. Despite being told I would get one that day, I didn't so I called after 3 days once again asking for a receipt and confirming it had been processed. I was told I wasn't actually getting a refund because I was charged an hourly rate for the car and what I had been refunded initially was correct, after objecting and going back and forth the rep relented and told me I would indeed be refunded and it would come in the next 2 business days, still within the original time frame. At this point, either he lied about me not getting a refund after all or he was lying about me still getting one, because if it was already processed why would he dispute it? I again asked for a receipt, which came shortly after speaking to him, but it was exactly the same as the original receipt I got, showing now adjustments or further refund. I called once more, and I was told that I wasn't entitled to any further refund because I returned it to a different return location than I had indicated. I finally asked to speak to a manager, who told me the mix up was that my file said that I had paid in cash when I had prepaid with my card and that I would get an $125.42 back on my card within the next 2 days and a receipt. The receipt came the next day, still the same as the original, but the next day I did get a refund back on my card. I spoke to 4 different customer service reps on the phone throughout this process, not including the manager I spoke to, and they all gave me different stories and versions of what happened and why I wasn't getting what I was owed. I was lied to constantly, I was given misinformation, and I was told things just to get me off the phone. I don't think I've ever had worse service from any company in any industry"
"This company started cheating. First 10 or 12 times renting was ok. Last two times they started cheat. One time they upgraded my car (that was really upgrade, because I received better car). Surprised asked ""no extra charge for such upgrade""? They answered: no extra. Later they charged me more than 1000 USD additionally. After long claiming they send back half of that sum. Last time I thought ""I'm clever, they will not cheat me"". Actually they downgraded my car and asked 400 USD (instead of 240 USD). I said ""For Rental cars I already paid 232 EUR and do not need extra charges"" They apologized and changed sum in document to 269.99 USD (that is close to amount of euros I was charged from Rentalcars). Later I understand that my car downgrade was decides as upgrade and that 269.99 USD was extra charge. I think that was my last order from that company."
"They didn't just start cheating, they have been doing it for a long time. You're just lucky they never cheated you before. I used to think death and taxes were the only 2 certainties in life. Now I know there are 3 - the 3rd one being if you rent a car with Budget, they will rip off you off."

"I hardly think these ridiculous fees are the fault of the driver. Budget's employee did not explain these fees properly. Most travellers do not have the time to read the tiny print on these contracts. I am staying in Victoria and plan to rent a car tomorrow for the week. Thanks to this gentleman's timely warning, I will be very cautious and will look at other companies instead of Budget."
"<Thanks to this gentleman's timely warning, I will be very cautious and will look at other companies instead of Budget.>And you should be cautious about signing a contract and reading the fine print with them, too. They ALL have rules (Terms & Conditions) and do the same thing. It's up to the consumer to know what they are initialing and signing; period."
<<<<<Most travellers do not have the time to read the tiny print on these contracts.What a ridiculous comment. You must make time or be okay with whatever they sell you.
"Ladydiver,Maybe I am misinterpreting your comments. When you say you are renting a car tomorrow do you mean you are reserving a car for pick up on a future date? If you are walking up to rent a car on the spot you are likely to pay significantly more than if you have an advance reservation."
"I rented a car from Budget in Kona Hawaii March 25, 2017. Granted that is a busy time of season but the line out the door at the lot to pick up our car was probably 40-50 people long and it took two hours for us to get our car. When we got to the counter instead of the Ford Escape SUV we had reserved the only car they had left was a Ford Mustang convertible. We did not consider it an upgrade. It was a muscle car with practically no trunk and hard to manuever. Terrible experience. Will never use Budget agian."
"DO NOT RENT A CAR WITH BUDGET IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC!I rented a small car for a week in Santo Domingo and i bought a full comprehensive insurance. Some parts of the mirrors in the car were missing, they got stolen, and they charged me 400 dollars to replace the parts!!! In total I paid more than $900 for a small car a week!! They didn’t send a detailed bill either. I called budget USA and they referred me to Budget international but the number didn’t work !! They know tourists don’t go back there and they charge whatever they want on your card!!"
Beware of hidden fees and agreements. I rented a car in Mill walkie from the budget counter. I was one of 20 people in line so everyone was in a little hurry. The attendant was very friendly and very quick. She simply told me to look at the screen and hit continue when I was done. I did not pay much attention to the screens figuring it was just a bunch of legal mumbo-jumbo. She brought up the total of my prepaid rental and it was an additional $30 so she went in and manually took off some kind of fee but I did not realize that during my clicking of the continue button I also agreed to their fuel surcharge. I drove the car a total of 160 Miles and about 5 gallons of fuel which would be about $11. When I returned they notified me that I had opted in for the full tank option and charged me over $30. The fuel charge was almost as much is the entire car rental for three days. It's ridiculous that the hide these and try to hurry you through the process not explaining anything

I was scamed for $210 for roadside assistance. The rep at Tampa offered an upgrade and extra insurance and toll cover and a tank of gas as extras which I declined. She then added roadside to the contract without any discussion/mention. I signed the contract not noticing. The rather unpleasant Irish lady I spoke to in the UK complaints office was clearly very well versed in responding to complaints about this scam. Avoid Budget they are clearly encouraging this scam and others and it does the company no credit.
"At the risk of repeating myself, it is all well and good to avoid Budget but many other car rental companies use the same tricks. So the way to avoid problems is to read your contract before you sign regardless of what company you rent with."
You should have seen my review we experienced the same sharp practice and got no response other than we should have read the small print. Like you we had just had a 10 hour journey some thing should be done to budget to stop this.
Slapping my palm against my forehead.
What does a 10 hour journey have to do with it? There is no small print. If you can't be bothered to look at the details of the contract- look at the final price. Any extras will be included there.
"Maybe Budget uses the ""interwebs"" to find THOSE passengers who have flown 10 hours - to target them because they are so sleepy and in a hurry!!! Seriously, Budget may not be the best, but they are also not the worst. Just scroll through a few pages of the forum posts and you can find many others mentioned. BE CAREFUL when signing and agreeing to stuff, period. It's your money."
"Budget Car Rental at Orlando, FL Airport: I will NEVER use Budget Car Rental again. Upon reaching the Budget Car Rental desk, we had to wait in line for 1.5 hours, only to find out that the ""Mustang Convertible"" which was the cheapest car available at the time of reserving my car, was not there. Not only was it not available, but was told ""did you know the car is currently being recalled on a safety issue? And if you'd still like to rent it, I can find out when one may be available"" - all of this after waiting ONE HOUR & 30 MINUTES on line! Several people got off the line, cancelled their reservations and went to another car rental agency, my biggest regret is that I didn't join them! Don't use Budget, they do not value your time or have ethical business practices to mislead you with available car rentals."
"Donna....Why not tell us what you did? What was the outcome? What car did you get? You reserved a standard convertible, not a ""Mustang Convertible"""
"Unfortunately, at this time our experience was terrible. But this applies only to the work of employees at the desk in Munich airport. The car was absolutely new and very comfortable. When we came to a desk, there was a very long line (15-20 people), and only 2 employees. My wife was pregnant (6 month), and there was our son (1,5 years old) with us. I asked twice to let us skip the line, but I was refused. 1,5 hours we spent in the line. At least, when we came to employee at the desk, she said, that there is no car C-class (medium), although I've made a reservation more then month before. She offered me Mercedes Vito!!! I do not know what I would do with an eight-seater bus, so I refused that offer. After that, she went into the back room, and in 3 minutes she took out the key to a completely new Skoda Rapid. So this car was already there, and she just lied, saying that my class's cars are not at the moment and trying to shove a bus for me. Disgusting service and attitude towards the client."
"Hi allI recently hired a car in Miami and was charged an additional £236 for extras that I wasn't notified about, asked for or advised about. They definitely scam people at the budget check in desk as when we arrived there was a queue and we waited approx. 45mins to be served. At the desk it was obvious that they try to rush you through their check in procedure in the hope that you don't notice the additional extras such as sickness insurance amongst other stuff that they add without your knowledge . They did this by prompting me through the contract which is on the screen that is in front of you. This screen only shows sections at a time and the agent kept saying ""click next,press ok, click next , sign there ,click next"" and did this all the way through the contract without giving you any time to read it. As you all will appreciate after a 9hr flight and 45mins queueing they know you are tired and just want to get on your way and by doing this they can easily scam you without you even realising.Furthermore they have charged me £114 for a GPS which he told me I didn't have in the vehicle and would need to pay if I rented one from them. After arriving at our hotel we discovered that it did have a built in GPS system so I immediately telephoned their customer service team to complain. I was told not to worry and just explain this at the desk when I returned the car and they would refund me. When I did this I was told that I had hired it and signed for it and wouldn't be getting a refund.... ANOTHER RIP-OFF ALL I CAN SAY TO ANYONE HIRING A CAR FROM BUDGET IS BEWARE (better still don't bother)"
Yet another post about all the things Budget did to them with zero personal responsibility for their actions. Unless you read what you are signing this can easily happen with any car rental agency.
"i realy feel for you as they done this to us. Even when we proved we already had the things we were charged for, they still would not refund ours. And because we signed without knowing we were being charged we could not get refunded by our credit card provider. BUDGET ARE ROBBING PEOPLE AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT. I wish i had read all the hundreds of bad reviews before using them. LESSON LEARNED BY US. NEVER AGAIN USE THEM"

Then when we returned the car they were unable to print out our receipt and so we didn't know any of this until the 50% above what we had paid for was withdrawn from our checking account. This company is totally unethical and we will warn everyone we know- not to use Budget!"
"Reserved a Chevy Impala with Budget in IND for a good price. When I got there, they didn't have any, so I asked for a ""similar"" car, which was what the reservation promised. They tried to get me into a smaller car and wanted to charge more,even for that. We went around and around ( about 30 minutes worth) wanting to charge 1/3 MORE for a smaller, lesser car. They even said "" well sometimes we don't honor those reservations"".Ended up going to Alamo, got a great car for less money and the people were incredibly friendly and helpful. Please read all the unhappy reviews above and don't fall for the bait and switch tactics of this truly unethical company. I will /never consider them again. Too bad there isn't a consumer affairs department to direct these complaints too. Budget needs all the bad publicity possible and I'll certainly spent several weeks telling about my experiences to anyone who'll listen."
Me too ... cowboy outfit ... NEVER EVER BOOK A CAR WITH THEM ... be warned folks
"I have had a similarly frustrating experience with Bduget but for slightly different reasons. I picked up the car in Las Vegas. The car developed a serious fault and so we had to waste half a day of our short holiday to replace it. No,apology or anything. Returned 2nd car to the office where we collected it which had shut at 4.30 pm. Telephoned adviser who said there was no alternate drop,off option so to return the following day. We then got charged for another 24 hours. Rude, unapologetic and jobs worth member of staff. I will never use Budget again"
"I've never heard of a limited hour car rental location that did not have an after hours drop off. But, perhaps what they meant was to return the car at the beginning of the next day, not the end of the day."
my experience of rental cars in uk and europe is that I end up paying 3 times the amount originally quoted. you need time to work out how come but when you have a plane to catch there is no time.
"STAY AWAY!!! Very negative experience. We have been manipulated in a Very nasty way into getting extra insurance which was already inculded in the deal, in Effect!we paid it twice This resulted in 208 USD extra Fees. They also tried Very aggresively to upsell us to more expencieve car. All the communication is purposely done to confuse you and rip you off. Stuff is extremely unpleasant. NEVER AGAIN!"
"I had a terrible experience with Budget as well as Orlando International Airport.First, the email correspondence with the central contact from the website was useless. I needed to know which car category would be suitable and the person who replied asked me to call the main number to speak to a customer service officer. However, I'm not from USA and time zone differences mean I can't call, not to mention I have to pay the long-distance charges as well. Is it so difficult to suggest a car category that can fit in x number of passengers and x pieces of luggage? That's not the worst. The worst happened when we arrived at Orlando International Airport to pick up the car. It is stated clearly when booking over the website that the additional liability insurance is OPTIONAL. However, the staff at the counter insisted that we take on the additional liability insurance even though we assured him we already had our own third party liability insurance in our travel insurance and credit card insurance, thus adding on a hundred dollars extra to the total rental fee. He insisted that it is standard practice for this insurance to be compulsory and he challenged us to ask every other car rental counter at the airport to check out his claim. If third liability insurance is compulsory, then it should be made known up front and included in the quoted price. We felt we were taken hostage because we had already paid in advance and it was already very late due to a flight delay and we just wanted to get out of the airport and go to our hotel. When we returned the car to another location, we checked and the person at the other location assured us that 'optional' meant 'optional' and we were not required to take up the additional liability insurance. I feel cheated. Shame on you, Budget, that you have a staff like that."
I have had exactly the same experience at Columbus Ohio.It seems the desk agents are on commision.I will never rent from Budget again or their parent company Avis.Shisters!
"2.95 pounds, or 2.95 dollars? You wrote one, and then the other..."
"Not happy with Budget in Whitefish Montana. We picked up the car from the train station but no agent was present, even though they were supposed to be there. They left contract in a lockbox. The price was not what was quoted on their web site. RSN fee was added which was for road side service. There is no cell service in Glacier so that was a waste of time. Again we were told to drop off the key off in the lock box. Again no agent was present. We never received a receipt, not even an email copy. We will never use Budget again."
"Teacher....A quick look shows that this particular Budget office is only open 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening. They give instructions about leaving the keys, etc....No reason to not use them again."
Yes they try and get more money from you but if you do your homework the charges are spelled out.
"We recently travelled to Orlando and booked our car direct with Budget before travelling. It has to be the worst experience I have ever had with a car hire firm.We arrived after our 9hr flight from the UK to be faced with a 2 and a half hour queue at the hire desk only to be told that they had no cars and we would have to wait for one to come through. A further hour delay and we eventually were allocated our car. 2 people on the check in desk, a manager hiding in the back room and a further supervisor spending her time ringing the car returns port.All the other car hire firms were dealing with their customers quickly. Budget were horrendous. All of their staff were working 2-3 hours after their shift because they didn't have any other staff.I tried contacting customer services but no avail. I even tried contacting through twitter but only got a short ""Hope it got sorted"" reply.AVOID AT ALL COST"
"Sharp practice seems to be their thing, Rented a Budget hire car from the UK with a pickup in Pisa Airport.After waiting over 2 hours to sign for the car, I was told by the Budget staff the CDW insurance purchased in the UK was not enough cover , I needed to purchase their own SCDW . Nothing but scare tactics for around 30 mins giving costs of £300 for a broken mirror ,£1700 for a body work scratch, total value of the car if stolen, All to be paid before you leave to go home. High pressure sales. This cost me 400 Euro on top of the original cost of 300 Euro inc insurance paid to their agent in the UK. I have since found out this is a normal practice to scare tourists into buying extra insurance."
Here is my recent complain to BudgetA surcharge was applied to our car hire because the time the vehicle was checked surpassed our hire of 14 days. However the checking in process at Budget Malaga airport has changed. Keys are now handed in to the office and the car is checked later by staff. On 11th July we dropped the car and keys before 09.00 hours but the vehicle was checked about two hours later taking us into day 15. This is unfair practice leading to us being charged a further £15.51. We telephoned Budget on 11th July and 13th July to explain this and the call handler on 13th July said he would arrange a refund immediately but we have not received the refund.
"Budget does intentionally deceive, and I don't understand what the advantage is for the front counter employees to do so. The only thing I can think of is they are trained in this way. I was charged $360 for a 6 hour car rental. The man at the front counter quoted me $70. He also did not ask me about any of the 'optional' products/services, but instead just tacked on the charges automatically. I highly recommend avoiding Budget for any car rentals."
"Rented a car at SeaTac and dropped off downtown Seattle. Shortly, after loading up and leaving the lot one of the middle row seatbelts wouldn't come down. On the way into Seattle I called the location at SeaTac to address the seat belt and the line rang for at least five minutes on several attempts. Now at the hotel, I called the national customer service line and they said I had to deal with the SeaTac location for resolution. The next day I dropped the car off downtown location and the attendant said he couldn't help me, only SeaTac could. I rented on Monday dropped off on Tuesday and now I'm in Canada for the remainder of the week. I made a few attempts to call Budget in Canada with no luck in resolution just the same ""deal with Sea Tac"" circle. I returned home from this trip a few days ago and started calling Budget Car Rental, no answer at SeaTac (several attempts), downtown can't help, and the national customer service rep. tells me that he cant do anything because it's too long after the rental that it seems like I am trying to scam Budget Car Rental. I asked for an escalation measure to be taken so that I could talk to the next person in line and was told I would be called back within 24 hours and its been three days. I have never had an issue with a rental car company...but I have also never used...Budget Car Rental, stay away for no other reason than they pass the buck and stifle customers."
"My family and I rented a 7 passenger van for the last weekend of July 2017. When we showed up to get the keys, we also needed to add additional drivers. I was told there would be a $100.00 hold on my account until the vehicle was returned (Pick up Wednesday around 6pm to drop off Monday 9:30 am). When I got online that night, before leaving town at 6am Thursday morning, there had been a $430.00 ""Hold"" on my account! While on the road traveling to our destination, I tried calling the local Fort Wayne office where we picked up from, I kept getting transferred to the 800 main office number. I was told that the only way to release the funds was to go to the local office. By this time, I was 300 - 400 miles away from home! REALLY??? I also was told the additional amount of the hold was for additional drivers and ins on the vehicle. BUT WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED JENNIFER AT THE LOCAL BUDGET ON COLISEUM WHAT THE HOLD AMOUNT WOULD BE AND SHE TOLD ALL OF US $100.00. SHE NEVER MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT HOLDING FUNDS FOR THE INS AND ADDTN'L DRIVERS AS WELL!!!!! I AM PISSED. I don't mind paying for services, but the services need to be disclosed up front. Especially when asked directly. Of course, 'THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO"" while we were gone. Upon arriving back, Trevor charged us for 6 DAYS, NOT 5! UNBELIEVABLE!!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO ADMITTING ERROR, AND NO MAKING UP FOR THEIR NON-DISCLOSURE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, DO NOT RENT FROM BUDGET.......EVER!!! THEY WILL GOUGE YOU!!!!"
"I'm not sure how a hold is gouging you, but did you point out when you returned the car that you were being charged for an extra day? I'm not sure how that even happens if they checked you in for the correct day. If they made a mistake on the date you returned the car you should have pointed that out at the time."
"Time and date of the return is done by computer when you return the car. If they charged you for an extra day you were probably late returning the car. They don't just charge an extra day for no reason. The $100 ""hold"" would be in ADDITION to the charges due. They would ""hold"" the cost of insurance, additional drivers, a $100 deposit, and the cost of the car. This is standard practice. Think about it..... If the total cost of the car and extras is $300 why would Budget hold only $100? What if you returned with the car and had $5 available credit on your card? How would they charge you the remaining $200 that is due?"
"yeah, thanks for that response"
"Gas charge scam from BudgetWatch for this one, in Orlando MCO I was scammed out of a tank of gas by Budget. At the counter I specifically told the agent i would bring the car back full, which i did. After my 10 hour flight I missed the fact he had added a gas charge to my Expedia fully paid up rental.I spotted a charge on my Credit card when got home, this a pre pay charge for gas. Budget say as I signed for it no refund. I have evidence that the car was returned full but no use....Very annoying indeed.On the plus side the car was fine !!Im very surprised Budget (AVIS) put up with this sort of thing... very nice customer service NOT !!check your rental agreement very carefully would be my advice"
"I recently rented a car from Budget in Cleveland. On exiting the Budget lot, I specifically asked the agent at the exit kiosk whether there would be a charge (beyond the actual tolls) if I used the toll reader. She said there was no charge beyond the actual cost of tolls. Just to make sure I understood her correctly, I asked her a second time. Again, she said ""no."" Of course, when the bill for the tolls arrived, the tolls came to under $3.00 but the bill included a $19.95 charge for use of the toll reader. When I called Budget (and spoke to a supervisor) he refused to provide me a credit for this amount despite the fact that I had been misinformed. He insisted that he could only provide me a $20 coupon toward a future rental. I don't think this is right. Budget is not informing or misinforming people about the use of these toll readers, perhaps even deliberately. BE ADVISED: IF YOU USE THE TOLL READER, YOU WILL BE CHARGED A $19.95 FEE FOR ITS USE."
"An update from me regarding the gas charge.I complained via twitter @budget and my Credit card was refunded, hope this helps someone.Thanks to Budget for finally helping me with this."
"When I arrived at the Hertz counter at 8 PM, I didn't have a car reserved because I had screwed up the reservation date and they had no more cars. So I had to walk around to the other rental companies. Only Budget had a car. The counter service was slow as there were several people ahead of me and the manager -- Harpreet -- was training one of the two agents. But he finally got to me and said he had a car. Thank goodness! He was very helpful and personable. My only issue was that, without asking me, he included the various optional services that I don't normally want. But I was so grateful to get a car I didn't even look. The car was clean and ran fine. Budget and Harpreet saved the day!"
"The experience with Budget car rental is definitely the worst i have ever experienced and i rent cars at least two times per month. First of all the personnel is very rude and once you complain to the customer service they become rude too saying they can not do anything about it. I went there 5 times and every time they charged me few times the payment claiming that my Credit Card does not work. Also every time they keep the deposit for at least a month claiming that it is standard procedure. I do not recommend anyone Budget unless you have endless time to argue with them and keep your Credit Card blocked for months. Terrible service and I am sure I will never use Budget again, I prefer to pay double than get this rude and unprofessional treatment."
"Same thing happened to me and now has been 25 days they keep my money blocked after returning the car and every time i call the personnel is becoming ruder and ruder, trying to teach me how banks work. BEST IS NOT TO USE BUDGET AT ALL!"
"THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS. I paid a 3rd party company for a rental car at Budget. I paid $164 with taxes, fees, etc included. I went to pick up the car and specifically rejected the insurance knowing my personal car insurance and the credit card I use to travel BOTH cover me when I travel. I did, however, agree to pay for the tank of gas because in DC sometimes just getting to a gas station can be a pain on return. Having said that, I checked in at DCA on time and was told by the garage attendant I would need to check in because of a problem with the contract. I waited in line and by the time I was assisted the agent said all was actually fine and handed me a receipt for a $225. I had actually forgotten I'd already paid but asked the agent why the increase from the $150 invoice I was presented when I picked up the car. I was told it was a $26 late check in fee for the hour extra I had the car along with the gas, insurance and associated taxes and fees. The Supervisor on site was unhelpful so after arriving at the airport I was told I'd be credited 50% of the insurance rate as well as the late return fee at 100%. I asked them to send me an email confirmation of that agreement which I never received. After getting home I noted that I had in fact already been charged $164 for the rental from the 3rd party vendor that I used to book. I contacted them and they assured me they would get on it. After more than a week, the 3rd party said there was nothing they could do. I eventually was issued a $107 credit from Budget but STILL NO EXPLANATION for the full $225 charge when I'd already paid $164. After reviewing all of the receipts ad invoices, I noticed that what the claimed was my acceptance of the insurance was actually a FORGERY of my initials. There is clearly one set of initials (mine) towards the top of the paperwork and some completely unknown set of initials at the bottom. When I called Budget again to complain, the new agent indicated immediately that he could issue me a 100% return of the insurance and late rental fee. However, when I asked him to provide an itemized bill showing where the $225 charge came from if the entire rental had already been paid for he indicated I would need to open a formal case for additional review. I did. I have yet to hear anything and I have no idea if they will issue me the balance of the 100% refund I was promised during my 2nd call. I am interested in pursuing a class action lawsuit against these scumbag vendors. They clearly prey on unsuspecting people and it REALLY aggravates me. I pay what I owe but I REFUSE to be scammed out of my hard earned money by their predatory tactics. Fraud is illegal and they should be made to pay!"
"August 31, 2017Budget Rent-A-Car 7135 GilespieLas Vegas, NV 89119Dear Sir or Madam,Upon arriving to Las Vegas on August 15th following a four-hour flight from Florida, we went to pick up our prepaid rental car. We had reserved a Chrysler 200 or similar vehicle and prepaid the $586.50 inclusive of taxes and fees.We were informed there were no Chrysler 200s available and was offered a Kia Soul. Not wanting the Kia, the agent promptly asked if I had a Costco account. I said no, but did have a Sam's Club account.She said that would be the same and said I could thus receive a 35% discount on an upgrade. She offered both a Premium and a luxury upgrade daily rate.Obviously upset about the situation, I left the desk to speak with my wife. The agent came over to us and said her manager would allow her to take us to see the vehicles offered. We proceeded to follow her out as she continued to push the Luxury upgrade saying it was the best for the price. A lone Cadillac was prominently parked nearby. As we passed, we told the agent we were not interested in a Luxury vehicle. We were then shown two Toyota Avalons and we chose one.Though I did not agree with the upgrade, under duress I reluctantly signed for the upgrade. Thisbrought the total cost of the two-week rental to $1,042.38. Not only was this a classic bait and switch, I could have rented the Avalon in advance and paid only $624.86. (See attached Avalon rental cost).To make matters worse, upon leaving security stopped us because the car's registration did not match the paperwork. We had to return to the counter and have the agent re-do the rental papers. She spoke to another agent saying ""I see what happened"", though she never informed us what the problem was.After wasting an hour of time, we finally departed only to realize later that the vehicle had a strong odor of smoke. Though the car's driver's side window had a no smoking'' sticker, a prior renter had indeed heavily smoked and Budget neglected to have the car cleaned. We had no choice at that point, other than wasting additional vacation time.A Kia Soul is NOT similar to a Chrysler 200. (See attached specification reports on both vehicles.)Due to this breach of contract by Budget-Rent-A-Car, we demand a full refund of the upgrade cost of$455.88. This was not a customer friendly experience."
"Are you kidding me? $1000+ for a 2 week rental from LAS? No way!! First of all.....I have been to Vegas many times and never paid anywhere near that much for a car. In fact I leave next Friday for a week and will pay $136 for a Full size or $139 for a Sport class. These aren't even prepaid rates.You were completely ripped off. But, since you signed for and accepted all this there is little recourse. I would have walked away from Budget and disputed the charge with my credit card when they didn't have the 200 category. Then, walk to one of the many companies at the McCarron Rental Center and probably got a car for much less."
"Hawkeye, Does that mean you are not going to authorize the refund? Sounds like Robert thought he was sending a letter to Budget."
"Appalling company. On collecting a car in Miami we were offered and verbally declined PEP (personal effects protection). We were told very clearly that there would be no additional charges to our credit card other than road tolls. Rather than signing a printed copy of the rental agreement our signatures were taken on a blank tablet touch screen. On returning to the UK an invoice for $75 +tax to cover PEP was delivered, the payment having been taken from our credit card on the day we returned the vehicle. I was unable to contact Budget by phone and my email was not responded to within 15 days. Eventually I was told the payment was not for PEP but for an 'emergency sickness plan.' We had not selected this option when booking online, we were not informed of it when collecting the car, were not asked if we wanted it and certainly never verbally agreed to taking the cover. Even now I do not know what this insurance policy covered - no information was supplied. BUT apparently we 'accepted' this product so Budget refuse to refund this fraudulent charge. I believe counter staff are working on commission for miss selling these products. Signing a blank computer screen is not the same as endorsing a printed contract.Edited: 2 years ago "
"A bad experience for sure. While I don't like budget I have never had an experience like the one described, but then stopped using them years ago."
"Rented a convertible mustang from Budget in Ft Lauderdale for Sept 3-10. Drove to Key West. Hurricane Irma was coming so, Key West had to be evacuated on Wed the 6th. We were going to just drive north and return to another Budget. However, when we got to the Ft Lauderdale area, we couldn't find gas anywhere. Every station we tried was out of gas because of the hurricane. We now had to stay in Ft lauderdale. We didn't want the car to be damaged by the hurricane and we heard that the airport was going to close on that friday, so we decided to be safe and just return the car on Thursday (4 days early from our reservation). We were charged for the full reservation of 8 days and also charged $68 for gas. Given the circumstances with 99% of gas stations being closed. This was a very poor business move! I am extremely disappointed that I didn't get any reduction for returning 4 days early and disgusted that I was charged for gas! Of course I would have filled the tank!! However, this was out of my control. I am extremely disappointed in Budget and they should re-think their customer service policy or things like this will put them out of business. There are other fish in the sea for car rental!"
First of all I am glad you are safe. That would be the most important thing to me. When did you get out of Ft Lauderdale?I suggest you write a letter to Budget and explain the circumstances. Perhaps they have a policy to deal with victims of Irma.
"I have just had exactly the same thing happen to me. They rushed us through, I checked verbally that there were no additional charges which they agreed and told us to just sign here, here and here and then they charge your credit card.Budget must be training their agents in how to do this! I have sent yet another email as Budget insisted I had to go through Expedia (who I made the booking with). I argued that that couldn't possibly be the case but they wouldn't budge. Expedia simply said that Budget said we had accepted the charge and directed us back to Budget. I don't expect to get my £110 back but from reading this thread I can see that this is far too common for Budget to be simply getting away with this. I can't believe there is no other recourse.I, for one, will never use them again. I've been travelling to the States for 17 years regularly and this is the first time this has happened.Edited: 2 years ago "
"It may not be the last time it happens if you don't look at the contract before you sign. You are right that it shouldn't happen, but it does and not just with Budget. I understand why you wouldn't use Budget again, but this can and does happen with other car rental companies too."
"<<<<< I checked verbally that there were no additional charges which they agreed and told us to just sign here, here and here and then they charge your credit card.There were no additional charges....just the ones on the contract."
"I have just returned from a holiday in Dubai and while there rented a vehicle from Budget who according to their adverts were based at the airport. This is where the problems began, I booked the car online, prepaid and selected a specific car, all of this was confirmed by Budget and I reconfirmed 1 week before traveling. I arrived at the hire desk at roughly 11.40 pm and presented my booking document, the reference number could not be found and after about 15 minutes it was discovered that this particular number had been used for a previous booking meaning I would then have to go through the whole process again. The service clerks were not only slow but had not understanding of how this would be handled, time was moving on and eventually after a further 20 minutes the booking was confirmed but with one problem , the car I had reserved was not available, this despite a number of confirmations. I was then informed that the replacement car was available at the car park desk. By this time we had spent almost an hour trying to resolve a very simple problem only to find that Budget are not based at the airport,only their booking desk, their cars are held in a depot 15 minutes away.The vehicle they then advised was my upgraded replacement was in fact from a grade lower than the one initially booked and had just been rejected by a customer who had been at the booking desk before me at the airport terminal. I rejected the car and eventually the found one similar to my original booking, when it arrived I was assured it was in good condition, having hired a number of time I insisted on a check of the vehicle to find it had covered over 48 thousand miles and the paintwork had so many scratches it could have been used a stock car.By ''tis time one and a half hours had passed and I still had a further hour to travel before reaching my destination so I accepted the car. Be advised pre- booking a car with Budget does not mean that it is confirmed, choosing a particular grade of car does not mean that this is what you will get and in the case of Budget in Dubai Airport , they do not base their cars there so expect a long wait. On the positive side they are extremely proficient at taking a further deposit and other additional charges .On final grouch, during my time arguing with the booking staff I was assured that the additional CDW had been included in my prepayment and this was written on my rental agreement only to find that when I returned back to the UK it had been again deducted from my deposit, despite a number of emails I have yet to get a reply.My advice is avoid Budget and look for an alternative."
"I have just returned from hiring a car at O'Hare Chicago and had exactly the same experience. On collection, the agent verbally confirmed that my voucher included a no-excess insurance. I was asked to sign blank computer screen. I am now charged for an upgrade, Personal Accident Insurance and Emergency Sickness Plan. At no time was this mentioned to me. On return of the vehicle, the agent just said everything was in order. They now charged $228. When I rang the US Customer Service team, they offered to refund 25% of the charges but I said this was not acceptable. Such cowboy tactics! We hire about 5 cars a year; this is the first time this has ever happened to us. I have disputed the charges through Visa and have also written to Budget but don't hold much hope. Yes, of course we should all always check what we sign but as previous reviewers said, the agents deliberately and fraudulently set out to catch you out."
Same happened to us in October2016 and reply from Budget was you should read the small print before signing.
"@502 From time to time, I ask someone to explain, if they can, why they did something, because it bears on efforts here to educate. For instance, I have asked why someone used a particular third party travel site. Here, I'd really like to know if there was some particular assumption, reflex or lapse that caused someone to sign a blank screen form. I doubt that this would work in the extreme case of just walking around asking people to hand over their credit cards and sign blank forms. In this case, there was a service offered, and I think few customers are unaware that there are any number of additional things you can pay more for when renting a car. So, what was going on? Rushed and hoping it was okay? Trust because there was an office for it to happen in? They advertise? Just deferring to authority?"
In July 2017 we were on vacation in Canada and America. We arrived in Toronto so we rented a car in Toronto. We paid 1.600 CAD. Later we discovered that renting a car downtown was much cheaper. That was not a problem; we changed the contract and we could pickup the car in town. We travelled in America and Canada and finally we were back in Toronto. We delivered the car and left. Everything was ok. The refund would be done on our creditcard. And guess what...? We are still waiting for the refund. We mailed and phoned but nothing happened. I post this to make others aware of this bad practice.
<<<<<We paid 1.600 CAD. Later we discovered that renting a car downtown was much cheaper. <<<<<The refund would be done on our creditcard. And guess what...? We are still waiting for the refund.A refund for what? Usually prepaid car reservations are non-refundable.
"I'm not following that at all. You paid 1600 when you picked up the car, or did you pre pay 1600 when you booked the car before your trip? A lot of pre paid car rentals are not cancelable or refundable.Do you have all this in writing from when you turned in the original car that you were entitled to a refund after turning the car in early? Or was this something you were just told at the desk?"
"I declined the fuel service, but was charged for it anyway. Later I noticed the charge on my receipt, after I turned in the car. I was told on the phone that I must send a copy of my fuel receipt. This is absurd, when the car was returned full of fuel.Beware of Budget trying to sneak in this deceptive charge. Make sure that your receipt shows correct charges before you leave the agency."
"<Make sure that your receipt shows correct charges before you leave the agency.>Yes, always. And yes, I have had to show the check-in agent my fuel receipt, even when the gauge registers ""Full""."
"You also need to look at your receipt when you pick up your car, so that any discrepancies can be resolved before you drive away. If the fuel option, unwanted insurance or any extra shows you have accepted the charge regardless of any verbal statement made at the counter.I am surprised they would even ask for a receipt after you agreed to buy a tank of gas from them in the contract."
"I also have fraudulent charges of Budget. We have rent a car in Israel and three monthes after I receive two charges of handling fees supposedly for manage parking tickets that they receive. When I ask them to send me copy of them ( as we have never parked on the street , neither receive parking tickets), them tell me they do not have parking tickets as they do not receive all tickets. I had to write complain and ask my bank for chargeback.We have neve4 such problems with another rental cars companies. It was the first and the last time I book with Budget, neither recommend it."
"OMG - I just had a similar experience at the Orlando Airport. The monitor was broken and we thought we were signing to confirm the package we had already paid for! We got slammed with a $350 bill when we got home for sickness, daily insurance and roadside assistance that I clearly declined because I have AAA. It is a scam - it is better to find a company with no people - sad to say, but the rental agents should not be allowed to 'sell'."
"Broken screen or not.....the paperwork you got before leaving with the car had all the charges listed. Look at it before leaving. If it's wrong- address it then, not when you get home."
"I wonder if some of these people are even getting receipts. I would never accept a car or even leave the counter without a written receipt detailing the charges, and I actually look at it before I go."
I'd bet there is a requirement to carry the rental contract in the car. Law enforcement may even require it at a traffic stop?
"The WORST! I used Budget in Fort Myers airport...Seriously... go ANYWHERE else - Not only was the line long and took a looong while (which is AWESOME when you have two kids in tow), but the guy behind the counter (Kurt) found the time to tell me all about Sanibel Island, where we were going (even though I didn't ask... now I understand why the line wasn't moving), but DIDN'T tell me that I didn't need the full insurance coverage since I already had it on my car at home (I had never owned a car when renting one before)Tried talking to customer service about it to no availUse Enterprise or Avis instead, or ANYONE instead!"
"It's your job to know what insurance you need, not the rental car agent."
"Let me express how upset I am with Budget Car Rental right now. The first time and LAST time I will ever rent from this company. No issues with the booking online or at the rental counter at the San Francisco International Airport. Everything went smoothly with no wait time or with the paper work. The gentlemen at the counter handed me the keys and told me where the car was parked. There were NO attendance in the parking deck so my husband and I found the car. Everything looked to be fine on the outside of the KIA we had rented. I did notice there was a white stain on the driver set before getting in the car. I am now regretting the fact that I did not take a photo of it at the time. I assumed that this would not be an issue since they would have already know about it since the car was being rented out again. We had no issues with the car during our vacation, and everything was fine. We returned the car to the San Francisco Intl Apo before our flight no issues. Now, well over a month after my rental which was back in October (10.16.2017) I received a letter (dated Nov 23rd) stating that I was going to be charged for a EXCESSIVE SOILAGE charge in the amount of $285.00. WHAT?!?! In this letter they state that they discovered a smoke odor in the interior of the car. I am not a smoker nor is my husband, during our time visiting San Fran there were the wild fires and if you were there you would have noticed it. So I contacted the number given to me in the letter to resolve this issue before any charges have been made to my card. I called on December 1st and was on the phone for 56 min to find out that I am be held responsible for the stain in the set (which was not mentioned in the letter) and dirt in the center console along with smoke oder. They sent me photos which does NOT justify a $285.00 cleaning charge. I spent almost an hour getting no where. I was told by one supervisor that they could not do anything about the charge since it was already a closed case. Then another said they couldn't do anything about it until the charge has gone through on my card (which was on 12.4.2017). Once that has happened they could make an adjustment. He said he had never seen a charge that high and he had seen where they reduced the charge down to $75.00 and to call back once the charge has been made. Here I am December 8th calling back, nice young lady there to help me out, still nothing resolved! She told me they could take 25% off the charge which is $71.25, this is not good enough! So I asked to speck to a supervisor, she was very nice and said I will try but I haven't been able to get one on the phone all day. I was placed on hold in hopes I would get hold of one of these majestic creatures called a supervisor. Needless to say this supervisor is no where to be found. So I was asked if I would like a call back. Of course I would and I ask if they will be contacting me today and was told they should within 48hr. This is just ridiculous and frustrating and going no where (which I'm sure is the plan). Like I said, I will never rent from this company again."
I rented a vehicle at Sky Harbor in Phoenix and did not leave the city. I was charged an e-toll fee for a toll road in San Francisco 1200 kilometers away. Budget has refused to reimburse me the toll fee. Despite a protracted conversation with a representative who was extremely polite common sense did not prevail. It was not a lot of money but I cannot imagine what the multiplier effect this has on Budget's bottom line at the expense of their customers.
"<I was charged an e-toll fee for a toll road in San Francisco 1200 kilometers away.>Are you sure the charge was a toll and not the e-toll service daily fee, which might be based in San Francisco? Almost every single car rental agency uses a 3rd party to manage ALL tolls. There are like 2-3 of them - which are all on-line based agencies. What Budget is charging for is from that 3rd party. I would contact e-tolls and get a record of the charge - and if it was actually from a toll collected in a different state - dispute it to your credit card or bank.e-tolls.com/Receipt_Request.aspx?rental=209"
No I got a receipt from etoll indicating where the rental vehicle had used a fast trak lane on I - 580 Fallon Zone. That is San Francisco.
"Agree.......I am appalled and so disgusted with Budget Car Rental company to say the least. I had to make an emergency flight to Orlando as my 3 yr old grandson was diagnosed with metastatic terminal cancer and had rented a car from this company. Once I finally arrived to Orlando and was given the reservation, went to the spot and there was not a car. I went to the service window only to wait more than 50min to get a car with a crack in the windshield. I was so tired I just wanted to get to the hospital. The next day getting into the vehicle it smelled worse than old mold wet dog and stale cigarette smokey bar. I returned the vehicle in 30 hrs instead of the 5 days. They are charging me not only 40$ for 1/8 of a tank of gas, but they are charging me the full 5 day rental. I have disputed charges without any luck. Today I have not only been hung up on by customer service, but when I called back the guy was very rude and belittling to me. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and was told it would be 2 min on hold. Well greater than 15 min later Carlos gets on the phone, no discount no reversing the charges he said sorry about your luck your agreement is either 5 days or you pay a much higher price. WOW don't even consider renting from them they are Scam Artists and will nickel and dime you for sooooo many hidden fees. I finally getting a slight discount, REALLY?$130+ $ for 1 1/2 day car rental and gas.... your car gave me asthma I should have you responsible and pay for my clinic visit bill and medicine."

"Sandy.....You have to pay for the gas you used, of course. I don't understand your complaining about that?You entered into an agreement to rent the car for 5 days. Other companies would have charged you the same as Budget did. <<<<<your car gave me asthma I should have you responsible and pay for my clinic visit bill and medicine.And you call Budget scam artists."
"I booked a car rental with Budget for our family Christmas trip to AZ and was promised (verbally) that I would receive a $37 discount on the rental cost if I called ahead of my pickup at least 3 days and prepaid at that. Well, when I called to prepay 5 days prior to pickup of the car I was told that they would have to re-book the reservation in order to make it ""Pre-paid Booking"" and that there were no cars available in the area and it would cost even more. I took it up the chain 5 people including a complaint on-line where I also received a call and got the same treatment. I even had the badge # of the person who made the original reservation. Stupid me to not make sure this verbiage was in the reservation. But where is the customer service relating to what their deceptive employee represented?"
"Rented and pre-paid for a Budget rental through Priceline ($33/day + $10/day collision) for 4 days.At the airport added fuel fill-up ($34.70) and upgraded car ($17/day).Returned 4 hours after 24 hour day so they charged for an extra day plus taxes, fees, etc.Total of $605.88!!Barely had tie to catch plane so I couldn't argue at the counter.Called customer service and the person kept going over the add-ons that I had signed for and disconnected me when I asked for a supervisor.Emailed customer service and the first three responses again kept repeating the add-ons.Finally someone realized that I had been charged the counter rate of $51.10/day so they said they would refund the difference between the counter rate and the promised rate plus the upgrade for a total of $133.75. (The difference in rates plus upgrade is actually higher)When I brought to their attention that this still leaves me being double charged for the 4 days that I had pre-paid and that even their proposed ""fix"" was lower than the difference in rates and upgrade I was told it was being forwarded to the ""appropriate management team"".After 4 business days with no response I asked how long it would take; they replied it would take 3-5 business days.After 9 business days I asked why I had not received a response I was told that $133.75 had been returned to my credit card and ""Thank you for choosing Budget your patience is appreciated. If you should have further questions, please do not hesitate to ask.""Apparently their policy is to ignore pre-paid amounts, double charge the customer, act(?) as if they don't understand your complaint, and then blow you off without addressing their error.Never again will I use Budget and I will recommend that everyone I meet avoid them at all costs."
"We usually do not get Budget Car Rental. This trip, my husband chose to get from this company for our trip in Europe. When we got off the plane in Charles de Gaulle after a 16 hour flight, we were glad that the people at the desk were accomodating and patient with us. Linda at the desk was very helpful explaining the insurance ( we decided to get full insurance), there was no automatic toll collection, and we could rent a pocket wifi for our use on our road trip. We really get full coverage insurance when we rent a car. This is just to avoid any unexpected problems in the future. This time we are so glad we did get the comprehensive insurance.While parking our vehicle, my husband backed up into one of the charging stations in a garage and it shattered the rear windshield. No one was hurt but we were concerned. My husband contacted the help desk and luckily there was an English speaking person that helped us out. It was explained that the garage was closed for the day and they will make arrangements for someone to fix the car for us. If the vehicle is not immediately fixed to contact them immediately. In the meantime they will look for an alternartive vehicle for us. The next day, the service person arrived promptly at our requested 9am pick up time and we were advised that the car cannot be fixed in a day. We called the help desk again with our reference number and we were advised that they are looking for an alternative vehicle for us. It was December, we were in a small town in France, and event he biggest city nearby had no vehicle available and we were leaving the next day back to the Philippines. My husband then decided - let us ask for help to book a train ride back to Paris, then we can just ride a cab to the airport the next day. That was the 2nd best move we did. Budget arranged everything for us. A cab pick up in our hotel to bring us to the train station. A pre booked/paid train ticket to Lyon. With a ticket continuing to Paris, first class of course. And as soon as we stepped out of the train tracks area, there was a man standing with a sign with my husband's name in it. He drove us to the airport.One may ask, why do we get full coverage for insurance. This is why you do it. For times like this, Budget took care of everything, paid for everything, and made it seemless for us. One may ask, why we did not insist on getting a new vehicle. Our trip was almost done. All we had was a trip back to the airport in Paris. Why insist on a vehicle, which you have no idea what you will get. Which you have no idea if they will ever find one for us. Glad we did it.Thank you so much Budget for taking care of us in a foreign country and not ruining our vacation."
"En la oficina de Budget Los Angeles Airport, me engañaron diciendo que era necesario hacer un depósito temporal. Al final me hicieron un cargo por más de $400 dólares.Conviene más rentar un auto con cualquier otra agencia, he visto muchas quejas para BUDGET, y las respuestas de BUDGET son siempre insatisfactorias.Es preferible interactuar con empresas responsables y personal capacitado. Al parecer el entrenamiento del personal de BUDGET es muy deficiente y engañoso a nivel mundial.(diciembre 2017)"
"I almost never buy car insurance, because in the long run it works out cheaper that way. What I mean is that I rent cars a lot, and Im a safe driver, so I have saved so so much on insurance that I could afford to pay the flu amount if I was unlucky enough to have an accident. I suppose it depends on how confident you feel on driving in a foreign country"
"the trip was grate at aruba but the car was a trouble from a to z , also the costumer service was very very bad .1- they give a car which is over 34 dent and scratches on it and the rear right tire is low(the car look funny on the street ) which is the car new model but very bad shape and poor service .2- they charge me not the same price as we book in Expedia .3- they enforce me to get them insurance because they said that Expedia insurance not work. 4- there is an old man that he say that he is the manger or owner and the way that he talk , he do not care about nothing and he talk very bad with no respect .finally i have all contract copy and a picture for the car inspection which is full with dent and no place to add more on that paper .i will send this complain to Expedia and all website that i can leave the review so people can find a rental car from other company ( i use many company and i am very happy with all but budget never again i use this company ."
"Do not rent from BUDGET . THIS company hasn't ANY resemblance of customer service and they don't tell you everything you need to know about insurance. I was charged $1165.40 because I damaged the wheels and tires. I was sold the insurance to cover the vehicle from the wheels up. Tires and wheels have to be covered by a separate policy. I bought ""walkaway"" insurance but it only covered the vehicle not the tires and wheels. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE CALLED ""WALKAWAY FROM BUDGET"" BECAUSE YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF IF YOU WALKAWAY. I now rent with National......WHAT AN AMAZING DIFFERENCE. TOTAL SATISFACTION WITH NATIONAL"
I was pushed from pillar to post by Budget when trying to get a refund on the charges I had against my credit card. They would not admit their sales people had basically lied to my face when I checked that there were no additional charges. I eventually went on Twitter and complained and have now been fully refunded.My advice - you're a hidden complainer one to one. Put it on social media for everyone to see!
"Budget Car rental- in Tallinn, Estonia.Checked many offers and did chooze the best price andpaid in advance. After returning the car, they did charge some additional fees (like 40-50 eur ) in addition to the abt 200 eur weekly car rent. When I asked them, they reffered to some fineprint. I refferred to the offer I accepted and paid in advance, still the same answer....They refused to return the overcharged money and when I made a claim to Budget Europe office, the answer came, they dont know, to whom to forward this claim.....OMG.NEVER EVER will RENT from BUDGET Estonia, Tallinn and do not advice others.The scam is to make a low offer, and then refer to some points, not in connection with the contract plus a dead contact to the main office"
"It is almost certain that the office you used is not operated by Budget but by the licensee there. In my view, that makes Budget an iffy place outside the U.S. You really can't rely on a company reputation when yo're not dealing with the company. Outside the U.S. the overwhelming majority are licensees. In the U.S., three quarters are company operated."
"I was charged $1165.40 for damages to my rental vehicle. I am furious with Budget because I was sold ""Walk-Away"" insurance but un-be-knownst to me it did not cover the damage to the tires and wheels. Apparently, I needed an additional insurance, not explained to me, to cover tires and wheels.After many HOURS on hold and being passed to several different departments, I finally proceeded to file a claim with the BBB. I told them that I would, at last resort, accept 50% of the total damage amount as a final offer. I included this offer with the BBB only after, being told by Budget's Escalation Dept, that I would not receive any money at all because I didn't have the proper insurance to cover the damages.Lord-be-hold, the BBB got 50% of the damage amount, refunded to me, from Budget. My question to you, and the only answer should be the balance of the damage charges be refunded to me. If, after what I went through with the ""Escalation Dept"" a refund of any amount was conceded by Budget then I should have been refunded the total amount...WITH-OUT question.Please refer to your Mission Statement:A-""We use new ideas and innovations to enhance service and increase customer satisfaction""rebuttal: given the hundreds of unsatisfied customers that have lodged complaints, filed claims and feel defrauded by Budget, in my opinion, is an out and out lie.B-""We solve problems creatively, and take action on behalf of our customers""rebuttal: my concerns were not creatively solved at all but, totally denied.C-""We provide consistent and dependable service that exceeds expectations and creates loyal customers"".rebuttal: If this is true, how is it that there are so many unsatisfied customers, who, most likely, are not loyal customers, like me, any more.D-""We always keep the highest personal standards of integrity and honesty""rebuttal: When a customer, as I did, asks for ""walk-away insurance"", there isn't any integrity or honesty, when an accident happens, that the insurance sold to that customer is void or non-existent. Again, refer to the many hundreds of complaints from dissatisfied customers who have taken the time to contact you, without much resolve, and express their anger, disappointment, and unsatisfactory Budget Rental experience.I wish this complaint be presented to your CEO. Your company structure needs to be totally re-vamped and every attempt must be made to right the wrongs that has happened to me and the very many other unsatisfied customers.I am waiting as patiently as I can for your response and resolution to this matter.."
#535 is a duplicate of #531 - not sure the poster understands that no one from Budget will respond to them - because no one from Budget reads these posts.

"Thanks for the tip. I have been chasing Budget for a month now, with some success. I got 50% back from the charges they applied (fraudulently, in my opinion). I am not holding my breath for the other half or I wouldn't be around to try to get the whole world to NOT RENT FROM BUDGET."
"Same experience here, they billed us twice the amount we normally had to pay , for all kind of assurance we ""agreed"" to take extra"
Thank you for the heads up! Really helpful.
"Possible Budget scam..beware..I reserved a rental from Budget at Kahului airport in Maui for $350. When I showed up the (not so friendly) agent said I did not have a reservation. I gave her my reservation number and she said my reservation was for the office on the other side of the island! I told her the phone agent obviously made a mistake since the airport is at Kahului, and asked how she could help. She said she couldn’t do a thing since they were sold out of cars! After some discussion she “found” a car for almost $1000! When I complained about this she then “found” another car (even though they were sold out of cars.) This car was mine for only $550 BUT came with mandatory insurance and roadside assistance. I told her I didn’t need/want those options but she said if I rejected them the rate was $1000. I told her I would deal with it when I returned and accepted the $550 so I had at least some vehicle to drive.When I called Budget upon my return to Texas the phone agent said he couldn’t help since I accepted the options, but as a goodwill gesture he could refund 50% of those fees. I refused since I didn’t voluntarily accept the options. I wrote to Budget via their website and they offered my 25% off which I also declined.At this point I am waiting to see what I can do, but Budget has refused to refund the charges that were added to my rental without my voluntary consent. Beware if you rent a car especially in Maui as at least one desk agent will refuse to rent you a car unless you agree to unnecessary services.Shawn Messonnier DVM"

"Shawn.....So, was your initial reservation actually for another office? You never said. I assume you checked while standing at the airport.I don't know what you can do at this point. You can't sign for the insurance, return the car, and expect to ""deal with it"" then. Insurance doesn't work that way, obviously.You should have took the 50%."
"We rented a Budget car through Costco (free additional driver) in Phoenix. The rental line happened to be 40 or 50 deep and slow. I was waved over by Mark as my turn came. He found the reservation for a compact, which would be ample for our 2 pieces of luggage. Mark however insisted that we would not be happy and did his best to up sell me to a larger vehicle for an additional $40 a day (more than double my quote) I insisted the car was fine. Then Mark started on the extra insurance. I told him I had 5 million liability as well as the Platinum card coverage. reluctantly he moved on to the tank fill up prepay etc. You then don't sign a document. but a signature pad as the accept/declines scroll by. After the 45-60min wait in the line I was glad to be free. The car was great and upon return the produced slip at the kiosk tallys up a total including the Damage Waver insurance which had been added on although I had verbally declined it. Running late for the airport, heading back inside for a discussion was not possible. BEWARE and double check! They appear to get bonuses for every up sell and Mark slipped one by me."

"We recently had a very bad experience with Budget Car Rental. We rented a car at the Orlando Airport on Feb. 28th. We waited in line for 1 hr. 15 min. to get the car (prepaid). We finally got on the road to drive to Stuart, FL. Luckily, my husband noticed the light that the car was very low on gas. We were able to pull over to fill up the tank. We returned the car to the Orlando Airport on Sunday, March 4th with a full tank. The employee accepting the car could not help us when we explained what had happened. We returned to Delaware and are still fighting with Budget regarding the $47.81 that they owe us for the price of the gas. We took a pciture of the empty tank and have our receipt. We sent both to budget and they are now saying that they can't read the receipt. My husband has put a copy of the receipt in the mail. When he asks to speak to a supervisor, his request is denied. We have never experienced such poor customer service. We will never rent from Budget again, and will recommend to others that they avoid Budget, as well. All this over a tank of gas."
"Just went thru the same charade with Budget in California. Car was supposed to be full, had a quarter tank . car was filthy, had not been cleaned since last renter. Bs'sed on the insurance also. MY BEST ADVICE: 1- stand at the counter and read the fine print, no matter how long the line is. 2-accept that these people are not your friends, and are going to try and screw you they work on commision 3-triple check the car for gas, marks or damage no matter how rushed you are. rushing you thru is there MO so they can charge you later. And always remember LET THE BUYER BEWARE"
"I posted just down from you, went thru Costco also and would up with Budget. The game is to rush you thru the process and trick you into signing for stuff you don't need. The agents work solely on commission, so the more they up sell the better. As I said in my post, LET THE BUYER BEWARE"
No need to read any fine print. The total price is easily seen on the printed contract. If it's not correct- don't leave the counter. Easy.
"I would not accept a dirty car, so would not have driven away without looking at the gas tank. Why would you not ask for a different car if the one they assigned you was so dirty? No matter how rushed I am I take a minute to adjust the seat and mirrors, familiarize myself with the dashboard, location of lights and wipers, etc. That clues me in to check the gas level too.I know people are tired and disoriented after a long flight, but I don't understand how someone can just jump in a strange car and take off without doing a simple look around."
"<<<<<I know people are tired and disoriented after a long flightThis comment always amazes me. I see people on the Orlando forum constantly claiming they were sooo tired after their long flight that they couldn't bother checking the contract before signing it. If you are too tired and disoriented to look at, and sign, a contract.....how do they safely drive the car away?"
"Good point Hawkeye and that's what I was talking about taking a minute to orient myself with a rental car including looking at the gas level before driving off, even if I am tired or in a hurry."
"Out here in the country, we have another word for that kind of tired."
"I have just spent nearly an hour reading all these comments from renting from Budget, I see your post was back in 2014!! So I hear what your saying , just at a loss of who to rent from now lol"
Warepawander......renting a car is not as difficult and scary as it may seem after reading the reviews. Where are you wanting to rent a car?
Whoever you rent from you need to make sure nothing unwanted is added on and take some of the other precautions you will find reading the posts closely. There is a top question with car rental tips too. Protect yourself no matter what company you use. Here is the link. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12…
"I can sympathise, waited 2.5 hours at Orlando airport desk. They were running out of cars, we were waiting for returns, tried to sell me a bigger car for ""only another $3 a day"". Never used them before and never will again. Why can they not separate those with reservations and those without?For tolls, we bought a $5 surpass from public for when we head out of this area."
"I had made a car rental from Budget using Auto Europe. At the time of rental at the office, Budget used my debit card to charge deposit (yes, debit card, it is possible if your name is printed - if you can touch the letters - and if it is a visa/master card). The amount was around 96.49 Euros. After returning the car around 3 weeks later, Budget was supposed to return my deposit but they did not. I told this situation to both Budget and Auto Europe many times. They just kept making me busy with stupid mailings, just making me tired, usual tactics. They denied that they charged this amount and they said it was only blocked. However, I can see in my bank statement that it is charged and it is not returned. As Budget asked me to do, I went to bank and got a statement. The bank official even wrote by pen on the bank statement that the amount of 96.49 Euros was charged by Budget and it had not returned to the account after 6 months until that moment. I has been almost a year and I still did not get this money back! I CAN SEE PROVE IT OBVIOUSLY IN MY BANK STATEMENT DMN IT!!! Although I sent this document to both Budget and Auto Europe, they still refuse that they charged this amount. I am not crazy for 100 euros, I am just angry. They made me spent hours for writing mails, bank statements and lots of arguments with my company. In the end, I had to pay this money to my company because they told me that this was my fault. I can not describe how angry I am. I am telling everyone what Auto Europe and Budget did and describing their policies everyone I know and all my collegues. I sent them my statement and they still pretent as I have not send anything. I am so tired of you Auto Europe and Budget. I will never rent a car from any of you or from Avis again. I will get my revenge by telling everyone and writing in every complaint place I find."
"That's the downside of using a debit card compared to a credit card. Maybe depends on the laws in your country, but generally you have more rights to contest credit charges and they don't have your money while the process drags on."
"I recently rented a car from Budget. The car was totally fine, but even three weeks later there are still 2 reservations on my creditcard. I have been e-mailing budget and calling them for a week now and still there is a reservation on my creditcard. Ever time I call they connected me to somebody else, and still it is not solved. So I agree with the fact that the Costumer Services is just really bad and they don't help you at all."

#562 Wrong forum. promotion and Spam - all reasons to report!
"Watch out for BUDGET DULLES AIRPORT as they will tack on late fee, when you are two hours early. That is not the only ploy they use to obtain extra revenues. They also offer you a better car, you accept and find out there is an additional without having told you it would change your rental price. CHECK YOUR RECEIPT THEY ARE A DEVIOUS OPERATION."
"I rented a car to drive from Washington to New York 2 months ago for a reasonable price. As we could drive earlier, I wanted to change the pickup time with one hour earlier via their website. When trying to do this I realized that Budget Car is charging this request base on a rental price for that day, so this was 70% higher than the original price I have paid, so I cancelled the hour and we left an hour later. Also the staff in both Washington and New York were very customer UNFRIENDLY. They were uninterested, provided wrong advice and information. Basically it looks like the staff in Washington are doing you a favor that they give you the car. The staff in NY were very brutal, specially they staff in the parking garage. I had the same experience when I rented a car in Houston. Is this also in other Budget Car Rental places ?"

"The ""scam"" as you call it can be easily stopped by you.As I posted on your Orlando thread.....I have experienced the ""folded up"" thing.Here's what you do......Stay put where you are.Unfold it.Look at the total price.If it's not correct- speak up.Have the contract reprinted with the correct charges.Off you go."

">>>>>I have a better solution, I will never rent from Budget again ( or Avis, which owns Budget). <<<<<<<Actually the better solution would be to read your contract before you walk away from the counter. These deceptive practices have been reported at other car rental agencies as well. Trusting a different car rental agency to protect you may end up with the same result. If you rent cars often enough you will run out of companies to boycott. Why not just take responsibility for protecting yourself?"
"<<<<<I have a better solution, I will never rent from Budget again ( or Avis, which owns BudgetFine. But, whoever you use, stop and unfold your paperwork and look at the total price before leaving. <<<<<570 replies to the orginal comment says I am not alone!MCO is the largest rental car market in the world. 570 is not many considering they rent hundreds of thousands of cars every year."
"What is too bad is that some don't understand personal accountability.So they folded the paper up, were you unable to unfold it to see what the amounts were?No one would disagree that it is a crappy business practice that pretty much all car rental companies use, however YOU are partly at fault as well. You made the choice not to read the document you were signing. You could have corrected it before you left the rental place."

"The original complaint was the agent folded the paper so you couldn't see the charge. Now you are saying when you unfolded it the next day you could see the charge. So, if you unfolded it and looked at it at the counter you would have seen the charge before you took the car.Nobody likes these deceptive practices and even those who know to be skeptical can be fooled. But we advise to do everything you can to keep from being tricked. I also understand why you would never want to do business with Budget again. But, as I wrote in my post #572 just using a different company won't protect you. They have all been known to use deceptive practices."

"Renting a car in Mexico is a different thing. All franchises are locally owned and operated despite the familiar name. Many problems have been reported, although the Mexico trip advisor forums also list some reputable car rental agencies. Too late for you, but people planning to rent a car in Mexico have to research the specific locations to avoid the worst problems. Here is an example from the Los Cabos forum. https:/…90848216"

Does that change your opinion about never renting from Budget again?
Great. You were refunded. That's good of Budget to do that after you agreed to buy it.Pay attention next time you rent a car- all this will be avoided.
"NEVER USE BUDGET!! 2 minute chips in windshield that I never seen, I am sure they were there when I picked up car. The car was filthy, so I never seen...I actually never seen till the guy told me $500 for a new windshield in Chevy, Cruze. A new windshield is not required for 2 not even noticable chip's. The sign on counter said $55 for chip's on windshield. I said it's $55 per chip, your sign say's it. He said that's corporate policy, not mine. Clearly a crooked, scam!! A small hole in the wall Budget with one man working in Harlingen, TX. This place has numerous complaints, I do not understand why Budget corporate doesn't close them. He also charged another $185 in charges that make no sense."
"Was online and noticed I could add an airline to get airline miles. When I did this, my prepaid rental suddenly was $100 cheaper! I immediately called customer ""service"" to verify this. The clerk said yes, take the cheaper price - nothing else will change so I clicked accept. My price came back the same, not the cheaper rate. THEN she says, 'oh, you prepaid. No changing of price can be done!' I specifically asked this question and she had just told me I could get the cheaper price!!! AAAGGGGG. Never again, Budget."
Bullcrap! My $200/ weekly rental car from Budget cost me $855!! Absolutely do not ever use Budget!!!
"I live in Florida, and when I was driving to the Orlando airport recently in my Budget rental,car, it occurred to me how inhospitable the whole toll scheme is, especially to foreigners. Orlando is certainly Florida's worst when it comes to the maize of roads throughout the area and most of them requiring paying tolls in order to use them. I have a personal transponder which I used on a road near the Orlando Airport. The Budget transponder was in the off position. The machine at the gate where I entered the toll road debited my account. This I thought would save the $3.95 processing fee plus toll which budget charges. I was wrong. After I'd paid the toll with my own transponder Budget subsequently billed my account for $5.20. When I enquirerd to Budget about the double toll billing, their response was I'd have to straighten it out myself. I've been renting cars from Budget for about 40 years. I have proof from the post on my SunPass (transponder) account that I paid the toll. I had to compose an email, with screen shots of my SunPass posting and send it to e-pass in hopes they'll straighten it out. Seems to me that if a customer of Budget presents a claim for an incorrect charge to the customer's account, that Budget could investigate and straighten out the error in the customer's behalf. This was clearly the case of a malfunctioning computer system, but Budget is happy to collect the $5.20 and put the burden of straightening everything out on the customer. Since Orlando is one of the entertainment industries' Crown Jewels, it would seem to me that there should be a better way to pay for the cost of using the roads than to nickel and dime visitors (and especially foreigners who've spent thousands to come there) with tolls. It's especially tacky when the unsuspecting guest gets a charge on their credit card for these tolls on top of which a hefty service charge from the car rental company. Very bad manners on the part of the host."
The Orlando destination forum has a lot of discussion about paying tolls with rental cars and this whole issue. It seems some are really ticked off about the charges and others see it as a minor cost of an international vacation and don't worry about it.The rental car companies (not just Budget) have a lot of competition much of which is driven by cost. So they low ball the daily cost of the rental and add on as many extras as they can get away with.
"The problem I see with the transponder debate - is that ALL rental agencies seem to have offloaded this to 3rd parties. E-toll, for example. And the systems DO NOT talk to each other. At the end of the day, the consumer loses the battle and the rental agencies make a lot of money nickel and diming on this. https:/…"
i had a more bizarre incident with me i booked the car from budget via expedia.comthey charged me whole amount in advance and ask me to show credit card at the point of taking car and they will charge you 49 pound. but that agent plays a game with me and charged me whole amount again at dorval airport Canada. i had several email conversations with budget and expedia but no one comes with logical answer except that you have signed for that. utter stupidity done at budget counter and thay charge me double payment for 15 days.please avoid budget they are just there to exploit the travelers situations.
"I wasn't cheated, just very disappointed in the quality of service. Reserved a compact car at Salt Lake City Airport for 7 PM, arrived to find they had no cars. Eventually received a car at almost 9 PM - and it was a Dodge Caravan mini-van. Fellow next to me was waiting on a 6:30 PM rental. Staff was largely uncommunicative, too. When I returned the car two days later, there were quite a few people waiting in frustration for their rentals. Not a good scene."
"After booking 6 months in advance Car rental with Budget, picking up at the Port of Miami after a cruise, I decided to check my booking 1 week prior to my trip, as I had been doing each and every month up until this time, I then realized the booking was cancelled, after sending my booking confirmation email to Budget along with booking references, they then replied with their response of "" we cannot find any booking"" and we cannot reinstate the booking as we cannot find it, you will have to rebook"", of which of course I checked to find the price had almost doubled, again, complaining to their customer services regarding this, this time getting absolutely no response. I had then no option to find another booking with now less than 5 days to go, using sixt which turns out was slightly cheaper than Budget, but with no shuttle from the Port, but no big hassle as an Uber taxi will be equally as good. I just hope this booking all goes smooth as previous bookings I have made with Hertz, Avis and Alamo. Never the less, Budget customer services were pretty shocking offering no help whatsoever. Conclusion: check your booking prior to your trip."
"In April this year (2018) my wife and I took a holiday in Florida. The holiday lasted three weeks and for us it was our ""Big Trip"". Everything went according to plan and we had a brilliant time. The only fly in the ointment was our treatment by Budget car rentals. Nothing wrong with the cars at all but I don't like being ripped off on the cost of petrol. I'd booked through Argus Car Hire as agents and paid for packages that gave me the extra driver (the wife) and a tank of fuel. I'd booked two cars - the first from Fort Lauderdale airport to Venice on Florida's west coast and then a second car from Venice back to Fort Lauderdale. On both I was instructed to return the cars with full tanks of fuel and have the receipts from any filling stations. However on returning the cars I was told they could not do anything about it. At Fort Lauderdale the receptionist said I should have got a voucher from their office in Venice - like I was going to drive back across Florida for it. I contacted Argus car hire on returning to the U.K. but they replied saying that they were unable to investigate the service at the desk with their car rental partners and suggested I contacted Budget directly. Argus has offered me a 30 pound discount on my next car hire as a goodwill gesture. Unfortunately when I contacted them for a car hire in Eastbourne they were unable to find me one on the dates. My wife managed to contact Enterprise Car Hire here in Eastbourne with no trouble.Okay, so back to the main issue. Sitting here at my desk I have the two last emails from Budget. For one of the cars they claim that there was no Gas Service Option - ( I have here Argus's car hire paperwork showing clearly that I did. For Budget's other email about the second car one paragraph states ""A prepaid fuel option provides the benefits to our customers who plan to drive a significant number of miles during the rental and don't want to refuel before returning the vehicle. Although unused gas left in the tank is non-refundable."" I was told to return the cars with full tanks. On the Rental Agreement it states the same , also saying ""Please provide a receipt for fuel purchased.""Right - so it's all my fault and I have paid for the same fuel twice. I guess I won't be using Budget services again and probably not arguscarhire.com"
"I booked with Budget often, but a recent experience has made me rethink using the company in the future. I talked to Budget Customer Service 3 TIMES about a reservation for a shuttle pick up from the San Francisco port terminal to the nearest Budget office, and each time they said a reservation had been made, told me what time to be waiting and that I would receive a phone call. I repeatedly (over several weeks) attempted to call the local office to confirm the shuttle reservation, but they NEVER ANSWERED THE PHONE. On the morning of our car rental, I called Budget Customer Service to inquire about the status of the shuttle (since it hadn't arrived), I was told that there was no way to confirm if a shuttle was coming, and in fact, the location didn't show shuttle service. THIS WAS AFTER CUSTOMER SERVICE HAD MADE A SHUTTLE RESERVATION AND RECONFIRMED IT TWICE BEFORE. So, we had waited 45 minutes for a shuttle that never arrived, and then I had to walk to the rental car office to pick up the car (20 minute walk), then drive back to the port to pick up luggage and the family. So, all of that took over 2 hours. Budget's Customer Service Office doesn't seem to know anything about the local offices, and can't call them since the local offices won't answer the phone for Customer Service either.On my last rental (San Francisco Embarcadero office), I had to deal with a very unfriendly agent ho took a long time to process the reservation (spend over minutes talking on phone while I was waiting for him to finish the reservation). Then we were told to wait in front of the hotel for the car to be brought up from the garage. 15 minutes later, when I saw someone who had been in line behind me get their car, I asked about our car. The Budget rep pointed to a car that had been waiting there the entire time, and gave me the keys. The car had not been ""serviced""---it was dirty. I had to go back into the hotel to get the agent to note that the car had only 1/2 tank of gas, which took another 10 minutes. I book with Budget often, but this experience has made me rethink booking a Budget car rental in the future!"
"AVOID BUDGET/AVIS, Panama City, ECP July 4, 2018Avis/Budget Rental Car Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport Panama City, FL 32409I had a very unpleasant experience with an employee who said his name was Andrea.I reserved a car through AARP Expedia to be picked up at 7pm on July 4, 2018. This was to be a 2 day trip from Houston to a nearby area, for a family member’s funeral.I stepped up to the counter and a person offered to help me. I showed this person my reservation paper work through AARP/Expedia, while I was on phone with hotel, confirming I would be doing a late check-in. Andrea (Troupe) began reading & typing the information and told me the car I was getting. But he could upgrade me to another car, can’t remember the name. Wanted to know my insurance company and told him State Farm. He wanted to see my insurance card. I told him I didn’t have a card and he proceeded to go through insurance options for his company. I told him no. I’d already checked “no” on insurance when I reserved my car online, and I didn’t need insurance, as he could see from my paper that I gave him.Then he began to offer me options to fully loaded vehicles for only $7 a day, another, only $6 a day. These offers for upgrades went on & on. Finally, he said he would give me a VW Super Beetle. Although, it sounded like a downgrade from what I was suppose to get. I told him that was okay, as it was the car I wanted. He told me I could not have the VW Super Beetle, as it was a downgrade from my paperwork. I said that was okay. He said no, that he couldn’t do that. I said “Well, I’m a Fastbreak member. I should be able to rent an upgrade or a downgrade.” This man actually proceeded to start my paperwork all over again. I protested, and he continued to offer different upgrades.After this whole process ... and a good 20 minutes ... I ended up with the Nissan Sentra, for the same rental cost, and a lot of irritation. He refused to let me have the VW Super Beetle that he had previously offered.I felt that this employee went out of his way to harass me for no apparent reason. I will never use Avis/Budget again. I will be going back to my usual, Enterprise Car Rental."
"I reserved a car online for pickup at Newark, NJ airport. In my reservation, I chose to add no insurance (since my credit card provides some coverage). At pickup, I was gruffly asked ""basic or full coverage?"" And I replied ""basic."" When they printed out my agreement, I noticed the price was $23 higher than what I booked online (this was a single day rental.). When I asked why the cost was higher, they barked at me ""because you chose to buy insurance.""The correct answer to ""basic or full?"" of course is ""neither!"" Would be nice if they gave that option up front, especially when you have specifically booked with no coverage online.Obviously they are hoping you don't check the price and don't notice you have just paid for something you don't want.Geez, just give me what I specifically booked online, and don't try to trick me into paying more. You should actually try to give your customers what they want. This kind of adversarial behavior might get you a quick buck now, but cheating customers is a terrible long-term business strategy. Budget deserves the ill will that its behavior generates.Be very careful with these guys. They will cheat you if they can."
"We prepaid reservation for 5-days at BWI airport for a family vacation. Upon arriving at the off-site location there was an unbelievable line at the Budget counter. It was the only car rental center with a line like it; waited 75 minutes to get our car - I kid you not! But - it gets better! Reservation was for Mid-size Elantra ""or similar"". Received a Kia Soul; I don't consider that a ""similar"" vehicle. To top it off - the car smelled like urine. We had to buy fabric spray just to make it bearable to drive - the hot, humid weather only accentuated the stench. I can not stress how horrible this experience was. I will never rent with Budget again - even if it means paying a little more with one of their competitors. Marginal savings are simply NOT worth it."
"I rented a car from Budget in Madeira for 29 days and asked about an additional driver for the 5 days my wife would join me. I was given a price, which I considered high, and a form to fill in with her drivers license information if we decided to use this option. I never agreed to this option, nor returned the paper with my wife's info. At the end of the rental period, I returned the car clean and full of gasoline. After inspecting it, the agent said everything was fine and my contract was closed. Three days later, I checked my bank account to find that 116 euros had been charged for additional services and when I phoned to ask them about it, they claimed it was for an additional driver and Roadside Assistance, which they claimed I had asked for and accepted. That is simply not true. Despite my complaints, including going to the ECRCS (European Car Rental Conciliation Service), they refuse to refund these charges for additional services which I never asked for nor accepted. I have disputed the charge with my credit card company as well and it remains to be seen if I fare better with them. I will not use Budget nor Avis again, but they will most likely get their 116 euros, at the cost of one customer. I have had problems when hiring rental cars in Madeira in the past; the place is beautiful, but the car renters are shameless."
"I rented with budget in Lanzarote - I had a puncture , changed the wheel and returned to the rental office where they replaced the tyre - I photographed the punctured tyre and wheel. They tried to charge €460 for “accident damage “ on my return to England despite having full extra insurance - I reported the charge to the bank as a fraud and they cancelled it . Don’t get stiffed by car rental companies - across the world I have found that the larger companies are worse than small independents . It all relates to the pittance the staff are paid and incentivised to overcharge at every opportunity ."
"Another poor budget experience here. They seem to prey on overtired travelers in some locations.Up till now everything had been ok with them, but this last experience has soured me completely - I will NEVER rent from budget again. Upon arrival in Rome/FCO I waited over 1hr in the un-airconditioned waiting room for my turn. Told the woman I had a reservation. After 10 or 15 minutes typing she presented me with a contract for 390Euro. The original quote I had was for $200 USD and while I was too tired to do a conversion I was pretty this was for much more. So I repeated my request - the original quote please. By the time it was ready it had been 90 minutes at 100+ degrees and my spouse was ready to faint. I was tired of waiting and really sick of talking to that woman. I took the updated contract and dashed out of there, assuming customer service could clear it up - there was no need for me to deal with those horrible people any longer.Of course I then discovered she'd still padded it again - better than the first offer, but still twice what I was quoted and I'd requested. I contacted budget customer service immediately and told them of the overcharge. Their response: ""sorry, we can't do anything as the contract is still open"".So immediately after the contract closed I contacted customer service again. They jerked me around for 4 weeks ""we need to check with the office in Rome"" before finally responding ""Sorry, you enjoyed the benefits of the extra coverage so no refund will be forthcoming"". 90E for a full tank of gas - how's that for enjoyment? Not to mention I returned with a full tank specifically to avoid such usurious charges. Checked with the BBB - hundreds of similar complaints - taking overly long to enter the details, then the contract additions are hidden on the screen, pressuring you to sign if you want to get out of there in a reasonable amount of time.The response by Budget to the BBB promised to retrain, discipline, and even terminate employees who did this. That was dated from 2016. Long enough - clearly this is their condoned business practice.I was a former and now I am a reformed Hertz customer - *maybe* it's common practice to pad but Hertz never did so if I asked for the original quote - not even at FCO. And Hertz customer service has always been polite and helpful rather than deliberately misleading."
"We too were caught by Budget this past June. We waited at the desk for an hour at Chicago O'Hare Airport and watched while the employees just meandered around doing nothing. As it turns out, they had run out of cars. When it finally came to our turn, we were told our car was out front and handed the keys and asked to sign the rental agreement. Nothing was said about an upgrade. By this time we were eager to get out of there since we had a meeting that evening we had to go to. Because of the delay at the Budget desk we were running late, ran into more Chicago traffic and missed our meeting. Then Budget turns around and charges us for the upgrade! Apparently we were supposed to have refused the car they offered at OHare and requested a refund right then and there. And then what?? Run around to other rental agencies to find another car? They tried to charge us extra for fuel, too, when we returned it full. They did agree to refund us the fuel, although it has been a couple of weeks and they have not done it yet. We have no recourse because we did sign the rental agreement but we feel ripped off and WE ARE NEVER RENTING FROM BUDGET AGAIN."
"STAY AWAY FROM BUDGET CAR RENTAL IN MONTREAL AIRPORT (QUEBEC). It is combined with Avis. Two counter staff at 10:30 AM Tuesday. Travellers lined up, both to fill out rental agreement, and then wait another 15 minutes or so for a vehicle. Counter staff are beaten down, begging to let Management know they need more employees in the back office. No Management staff on site. This was my second experience in 3 weeks. National, Enterprise the lines moved and renters walked out with keys."
"Hi, I found similar deceptive charges renting from Budget in Manhattan - my husband got the hard-sell on optional extras, which he declined, yet we were still charged for them. They then make it notoriously difficult to get hold of (2 and a half hours plus ringing various customer services centres, live chats, and trying to call the actual rental branch which is permanently engaged...) to actually discuss with anyone. Apparently they're free to do what they like, and then write the bill in such a convoluted manner it makes it super hard to understand. Apparently they also take money as a 'holding fee' without telling you... When we complained to the Boston branch (where the car was returned) they couldn't have done less to help us - they simply didn't care at all. Highly unimpressed all round."
"<<<<<They then make it notoriously difficult to get hold of (2 and a half hours plus ringing various customer services centres, live chats, and trying to call the actual rental branch which is permanently engaged...) Just glance at the final cost. It takes less than 30 seconds. <<<<<Apparently they also take money as a 'holding fee' without telling you... Very common- most all companies require a credit card hold. It is not a charge but just an authorization. It is then released some days after the car is returned. It never appears on a credit card statement."
"""Glance at the final cost"". The issue here is that budget intentionally makes that difficult. They wave a screen at you while saying it's what you want and need after a purposely slow preparation process. That's a very tiny font and hard screen to navigate if you've never seen it before.You know what's easy and fast? Budget could prepare the contract EXACTLY AS IT WAS RESERVED. Any changes are intentional deception. Why are you defending them? Should we dig the original quote from our luggage after a long trip just to defined ourselves from predatory practices like these? No thanks, I deal with companies I can trust, not ones I need to watch every second.Edited: 2 years ago "

You are given a paper copy of the contract and charges. It takes less than 30 seconds to look at the final price.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Why are you offering advice on a process that you don't use? They don't give you a paper contract, you sign the electronic screen and they give you a paper authorization to take the car. You need to examine the contract later when you get it by email.The point remains - it's better to deal with a company that can be trusted. Suggesting we deal with them but watch our backs is foolish. It's a corporate attitude not an isolated incident. As I discovered dealing with Budget customer service."
I don't need to be a Budget customer to know that I wouldn't hand over my credit card and then leave without knowing what they charged me for. My point is......these practices can be stopped by the consumer. You could have avoided this. You have the power. Spend a few seconds. Look at the price.
We ‘trusted’ the Budget rep last September when we collected a car hired through Auto Europe.After telling the rep we did not want any extra insurance this was added and it was t until our card statement arrived when we were back home did we realise. My husband had signed a machine at the desk showing no details of the agreement and the printed paperwork was folded and handed to us. Stupidly we trusted the rep and did not check but after a nine hour flight all you want to do is get your car and get to your destination.We were also charged for fuel despite having a receipt from the drop off point confirming the car was full.Our credit card company has backed us and refunded the money taken by Budget but we are still getting emails from them!Having looked at reviews online we are not alone.Never again would we use Budget!
"Well thanks for jumping in and offering condescending common sense advice for something you're not a party too. They don't charge your credit card till you return the car. On the slip releasing the car she left (leaves?) the estimated rental charges section blank. Yes, if it was ""Fred's no name rentals"" I'd be careful, but I expect more from a name like budget/avis - I expected the service I received from Hertz.Of course it makes sense to watch your back, but it makes more sense to deal only with companies that don't take advantage of you. Like I and previous posters (victims) have found, find one that doesn't prey on customers tired after a long flight with deceptive tactics. This was no accident, it's their condoned business practice as I discovered when I read the BBB complaints and when dealing with their customer support team who also specialized in being misleading."

"Yes, condescending. The helpful warnings are ""watch out for budget's deceptive business practices"". Do you really think ""you should have checked your contract"" is a revelation to anyone? Or even slightly helpful?If you go to a shop and they deliberately overcharge you, take pains to keep you from noticing until after you leave, and when you complain they say ""well, you should have checked your receipt"" you'd still go back for more? Not me. Once a cheat always a cheat. Or since you seem to prefer platitudes, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.As I said, I checked the contract when it was made available to me later by email and I complained immediately. And of course I inspected the car before I accepted it, this wasn't my first rental. Just my last ever from budget or avis.Thanks for coming out, both of you. Good luck with your post count.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Arrived Chicago ORD airport late in the evening. At the counter a girl ask me if I mind taking a Jeep instead of intermediate 2/4 door car that I had original booked because no vehicle available. So I ask her if there's a upgrade charge and she actually respond ""NO"". But in the contract she type in the extra charge for $75 which I didn't see and i signed it. But what is worst is that they now charging me additional $241.00 for a chip on the windshield which it wasn't there when I return. Even the lady who check the vehicle in say everything was good. This is the first time I rent from Budget and will be the last."
">>Should we dig the original quote from our luggage after a long trip just to defined (sic) ourselves from predatory practices like these? <<From an Avis booking confirmation:""DON'T FORGET to bring this document along with you when you pick up your car"". I would expect Budget to use similar wording."

"Mike, I totally understand how you feel about Budget and never wanting to do business with them again.If this has not been conveyed yet I think it is important to know. These types of deceptive practices are reported with many car rental companies all around the world. So, avoiding Budget is understandable and will make you feel better, but please don't make the mistake of thinking this can't happen again with a different company.Seriously, the best way to protect yourself is to read the contract before you leave the counter. Don't rely on statements made by an agent who is probably working on commission. This does not help with your current issue, but it is good information to have for the future."
"Are you all employees of budget? What BS.Are you seriously defending budget's practice of deliberating padding contracts? Of course one should check. And we do - or there would be NO COMPLAINTS HERE! We all discovered the discrepancy at some point and tried to clear it up. Budget refuses to do so and here we are. 60+ pages and thousands of letters to the BBB saying the same. Who also tried to clear it up, and to whom budget admitted it happened and said they would fix it. Go read their response.This is 2018. They ALL say bring the reservation, but of course it's already in their system. You bring the paper in case THEY lose it. Budget HAD my booking, they found it just fine in their computer - they knew what car I'd booked, for how long, etc. This was no mistake, she padded the contract on purpose. I TOLD her after the first contract I wanted the original booking. She padded it again. I was sick of her, that office, the heat, their ancient, slow booking procedure. I assumed that, like with any good company, this was easily sorted through customer support as it was CLEARLY too difficult for her. But no - customer support put me off with ""we can't do anything while the contract is still open"" followed by ""oh, you already enjoyed the benefits so no refund for you"". Again, obviously intentional and supportive of their practice.This is a dishonest company with deceptive business practices. Period. You all can keep dealing with folks that try to rob you blind. Why, maybe you should work there if you don't already! You clearly feel that if you cheat someone and they walk out without catching you that's ok. You go ahead and try to sleep at night - maybe you already do. Life's too short, I'll deal with good people and steer clear of you crooks."
"So, Mike, steer clear of Budget. Don't ever use them again.But, whoever you use, look at the price you paid before leaving."
"@przyk, absolutely right, there are crooks everywhere. But there's also corporate identity, and whether dishonestly is ingrained. I've never had a problem like this with Hertz - clearly a different corporate attitude there.This isn't about teaching us to check the contract or read the receipt - of course you're right. This is about deliberate padding, deceptive presentation of the contract, and a counter environment calculated to push us into signing without checking properly. It's about our discovering and reporting the problem, and budget's refusing to fix it. This is their (and yes, probably others) standard operating procedure.If we *accept* this, we get the world we deserve. I vote with my wallet."
"Gee hawkeyetough, more profound advice, thanks.I say again - this isn't a juvenile lesson about checking a contract or receipt (put that in a general topic if you're so inclined to teach). This is a warning of Budget's corporate practice of *deliberately* misleading customers.Here's some more profound advice: integrity is about what you do when no one is looking.The budget practice shows a lack of integrity. Accepting it is revealing too."
"Had the very same issues in Orlando last week , $154 slipped on for personal effects insurance which my travel insurance covered.All the extras offered were declined by myself and another member of our group but were both added on unknowingly.Their customer services are at best a joke , much the same as the company.I will never use these / Avis again."
"Because of the demonstration of intent by Budget.In their BBB response Budget admitted it was a broad problem and promised to retrain, discipline and even fire offenders. But when (corporate) Budget customer service systematically misleads (not just one but many reps, it's a call center) to support the service reps it proves policy and intent. There has been no effort to retrain even 2 years after their response. It's not just one bad representative and my misfortune.To suggest it's not corporate policy is naive. To imply it's a paranoid ""huge corporate conspiracy scheme"" is even more naive. You yourself suggest it's endemic. Budget's crappy contract preparation process is *obviously* by design. Of course their employees are trained to upsell and given incentive do so. They're likely taught to lead with an upsell and to make each change take 10-15 minutes of typing so the customer will give up after the 2nd or 3rd try. It's naive NOT to see that as purposeful.Whether one checks the charges before leaving or immediately after doesn't matter with a good company, a good company will make it right. Shame on anyone who defends a company that does not. Shame on anyone who suggests such dishonesty is acceptable and it's the consumer's responsibility to police and not the company's to manage. And shame on suggesting it's ok for rental companies to prey on rookies. (It wasn't, I travel often on business and I've rented 100s of times from hertz. This is the 2nd and now last time from budget and first time I've ever needed voice so strongly). If you feel it's endemic to this business, post THAT in a general thread. Don't accept and defend a poor practice with ""well, they all do it"". And if you don't like what I say, nobody is making you read - block me.I will continue to direct my business to honest folks. And warn of companies I find to be purposely deceptive."
"Looks like I touched a nerve... Rome was a thousand years and more ago, many of us have progressed since then. Knowing that integrity is not universal doesn't require us to give up on it ourselves, nor continue to deal with those who do.Conspiracy was your word not mine.You and yours offered only empty platitudes, there was no proper travel advice. This is a travel site, the warnings here are based on REAL travel experience with Budget, of their deliberate bait and switch tactics. You platitude posters down play risk: ""they all do it"". To what purpose? Just to pad your stats or some other vested interest? Do you feel so superior that you need to teach us we should read contracts and receipts? That is condescending. And ignores Budget's practiced slight of hand (of which some of you admitted you had no experience).Read the posts! Budget doesn't give you a printed contract. They nod and smile and pretend to agree, ignore the quote on the reservation, pad the contract, wave a screen in front of you to sign, and send you on your way after far too long of a wait. They email the contract later, and when you complain customer service jerks you around. There is no receipt until you return the car. Caveat emptor indeed. And no, they don't all do it."
>>>>>>Budget doesn't give you a printed contract.<<<<<<<Let's keep the farce going. Did you ask for a printed contract? Can anyone else confirm that Budget will not give you a printed contract even if you ask for one?Edited: 2 years ago 
"Thanks for the clarification Smushie. It has been a number of years since I rented from Budget. I'm not trying to avoid them, I just go with whoever is cheapest (within reason, avoiding the likes of Fox, Advantage, etc.)I have read other recent posts from people who received written contracts, but didn't ""have time"" to look at them until a couple days later, so I thought it was still possible to get a written copy. In fact I recall reading a post from someone who said the agent tricked them by folding the contract before handing it to them, as if unfolding the paper was too much of a burden, lol. I can see where the unscrupulous agent would discourage giving a written copy if they have pulled a bait and switch.If Mike or anyone else cares to look there is some valuable advice to be had here, despite the sometimes snarky remarks."
Worst experience EVER !! Called the morning of my arrival stating flight was cancelled and I would have to pick up the car the following afternoon ( 3 days instead of 2). Once at airport told we had to go straight to shuttle as booth in airport was closed. Once at location we found out there was a power outage and had to wait 1 hour for a car!! Got bill and found out they charged for 3 days instead of 2!!! Flight was cancelled again on day of return the only flight home was out of Ft Lauderdale. Called to find out if I could keep car and return to different location --phones were out!!! 800 number said we had to go to original location to find out as info was not in system because of the blackout. Drove from Ft Lauderdale to West Palm in a storm only to find out they were still having problems. I was charged for another day and return to different location fee. Now I paid for 4 days instead of the 3 I was there for. Next time it will be cheaper to Uber all over.
"LOL! Seriously? I'll gladly defend your right to post as vigorously as I will question your motives. This is a thread for ""Budget Car Rental"" on the ""Bargain Travel"" forum. What I suggested was use a general section as a podium if you want to give unchallenged sanctimonious advice. And block to me if you don't like my challenges.AS PER THE ORIGINAL POST this discussion is about warning folks of Budget's underhanded practice of upselling quoted reservations by sneaking unrequested services into the contract while arranging to make contract review as inconvenient as possible. Including lying when asked if there were any extra charges. THAT is unethical.Your ""blame the victims"" attitude is supercilious and distasteful. Yes, we all know we should read before signing, thanks again for your empty advice. Were I ever to return I wouldn't need your advice to check closer. But this is not just about me.You defend Budget's behavior with ""they all do it, it's your fault for not checking"". It's shameful you think it's ok to behave unethically and the onus is on the victims to catch you. Those of us with integrity call them out for what they are and warn others specifically about their tactics.For the record - I never said I was too busy, I said I was tired after a long overnight flight and a 1hr wait in a 30C plus waiting room (clearly their modus operandii), felt pressured that my spouse was near fainting, and I made a mistake - I trusted Budget to sort it out. Get your facts straight.I do certainly welcome this discussion - the more we discuss budget's bait and switch tactics the higher this gets in search engines and the more people are warned."
"""While I was going over teh reciept I also notice I'd been charged $167 dollars for additional sickness insurances, something already covered by my travle insurance. Next to these charges was teh work ""accepted"" and this was one of the area I'd initialed.""""Missing anything?"". Yep, the part about me questioning your integrity. And my admission of my mistake. Do you really think it's ok for them to act like that or are you just to stubborn to back down? I prefer to believe it's the latter, that you're actually a good person.And now I'll question your reading comprehension: the hertz thread is about vehicle damage charges, not contract padding. It's 2 pages and 4 years old. This thread is 64 pages with the majority of the complaints about contract padding and is still fresh today.Funny enough, the first responder is hawkeyetough88 who says again ""Get a receipt"". LOL! You're always given a receipt when you drop off a car. Talk about a post count groupy.Good job on the research. Good job proving it's ok to cheat when everyone else does it. (Yes, I'm sarcastic, be sure to call me out on that. At least you haven't attacked my spelling or grammar yet)."
"Oh, I get it, ""reading comprehension"". Now I see the problem. When we call out unethical behavior on the part of a business, we don't need none of this: platitudes - a remark or statement, especially one with a moral content, that has been used too often to be interesting or thoughtful.from post groupies who are: supercilious - behaving or looking as though one thinks one is superior to others.as  rationalizations - self-satisfying but false or inconsistent reasons for one's behaviorto blame the victims."

"There has been no dispute that checking the contract is the solution. My issue was with the sanctimonious posts that added nothing to the conversation, but rather blamed the victims, rationalized unethical behavior, and upped post counts. I'm going to say Budget because that's the topic of this thread but I accept your word that others do it too. Perhaps this is common ground:Many Budget agents will ignore your reservation and pad your contract with unrequested add-ons such as extra insurance, fuel charges, roadside assistance, upgrades implied as being free, etc. Be cautious as initials are used both to decline insurance or accept it, which is not always clear.The agent will then present the contract in a manner to distract you from noticing the added charges. The initial contract and each change will take an inordinate amount of time to prepare. Verbal assurances that they have complied with your wishes may be untrue. This is intentional, these agents are exploiting your impatience.Despite it being unethical, Budget customer service will NOT make it right. You MUST check your contract before leaving when dealing with Budget. Allow for extra time or rent from somewhere else.Kudo's to przyk who had the best advice - join the club to avoid the agents completely.Damage disputes are similar but a separate topic but there seems to be a pattern - if at pickup there unmarked damages and a slow or missing attendant this can be a sign of trouble.LOL, tin hats. I said unethical business practices not conspiracy. Budget themselves admitted this was the case in their response to the BBB."
"From my experience, Budget Rental cars have a policy of making mistakes and hoping no-one sees them. I had already got full insurance through rentalcars.com yet they then added a charge for this again at the airport. The policy document was in Italian and after an hour wait, was in a hurry to leave so signed the form. They now refuse to give a refund and hide behind the 'you signed it' approach even though it was their mistake.Worst company I have ever had to deal with."
"They certainly are terrible. A verbal contract: ""Just give me what's in the reservation."" ""Certainly sir"" is just as legally binding as a signed contract. They're hiding behind verbal being difficult to enforce as much as ""you signed it"". That you already had insurance certainly proves there was no request nor intent on your part for anything additional.Being persistent with customer service might help. After many weeks of complaining, each time insisting on a review by a supervisor (which never happened), they've given me part of my money back: ""Our records indicate, based in our records due to the miscommunication at the time of pick up with the added charges to your contract."". I'm continuing to press for the rest. Of course it's about the principle more than the money. If we complain enough they may decide deception is a poor business practice."

"“It's shameful you think it's ok to behave unethically and the onus is on the victims to catch you.” I don’t want to speak for anyone else, but I don’t think anyone is saying it’s “ok” for a company to behave unethically, but that we must assume any company will behave unethically if given the chance. Yes, this is a very cynical worldview, but it often turns out to be a very honest and truthful worldview, especially when dealing with large corporations vs. smaller businesses. I believe it IS the onus of every consumer, as unfair as that might be, to stay hyper-vigilant in these matters. It’s just the sad reality of the world. Not reading the fine print and every Term and Condition of a policy, whether purchasing an airline ticket, booking lodging, renting a car, buying a TV or anything else just doesn’t fly anymore. It may come across to some as blaming the victim, but whenever I hear someone say, “well, I trust (insert huge multi-million dollar company) to do the right thing” I assume they are extremely naive at best."
"It does depend on the context. But let me ask again - why do you defend Budget's practice of adding unrequested items to the contract and trying to slip them by?Or are you suggesting Jim is lying and did specifically request extra, unneeded insurance? That's a bit insulting. I *hope* you're not saying ""good on Budget"" for cheating to make a few extra bucks.Or is it because I called you (and others) out on your sophomoric ""check the contract"" advice as if those of us who got burned wouldn't know to do that next time we dealt with Budget?Ask yourself - of your 8700+ posts how many were unique, profound pearls of wisdom? And how many were vain (both meanings) attempts to show how savvy and worldly you are? Changing topics to be about yourself is one of the biggest misuses of social media."
"You can type paragraph after paragraph, Mike. But its still very simple.....check the price before signing and leaving."

Good that you found this thread so you could use it to show us all how smart you are a few more times.<<Could I respectfully suggest that you refrain from posting personal attacks on posters whose opinion doesn't match yours?"
"Of course. I will note that I attacked the value of posts, not the person. I hope no one is conflating their posts with their identity.

And while I couldn't care less about that kind of attack and I don't need to be defended from it, you might want to check you're being even handed with your suggestions."
"They did similar to me. I found a ""deal"" on-line that would give me a ""standard"" car for the ""compact"" price, so I took it. But, as soon as I did, I discovered $60.57 in additional surcharges and fees. When I tried to back out of the deal, I discovered that would cost me $50.00, too. I was trapped in the deal, so I took it. When I picked up my car, they bumped me down a car grade from a standard to an intermediate saying it was ""similar,"" but, when I went to the stall to pick up my car, there were people already in it pulling off! I went back inside. They put me in another car, but, again, it was a downgrade to a ""compact."" So, I got no upgrade at all, and paid a lot more than expected for it, but it didn't end. After I returned the car, I received another charge of $37.41 for what I do not know, so the whole rental that was supposed to be a ""bargain"" ended up costing me $208.68 for a three-day rental, or $69.56 a day, and almost twice the original amount I agreed to and expected to pay!"
"We're in absolute agreement about carefully reading contracts.Our disagreement is whether such sophomoric advice is helpful or pointless self promoting drivel.I honestly can't tell whether we're in agreement about Budget's deceptive contract practices. Blaming the victims and saying they all do it sounds more like a defense than a condemnation but I don't recall you taking a proper stand either way.ovolacto, like most of us, is posting a warning to help others, not asking for help himself. He knows he was baited with a standard car and was switched to a compact due to ""inventory problems"" (which is illegal if intent can be proven), and he knows he was a victim of misleading pricing. He doesn't need to be told to check his receipt nor whether he should ever go back."
"Sometimes I wonder if these rental car posts help anyone at all??In the years I have posted at TA I have seen thousands of complaints about renting cars. Most are all very similar. I'd bet 80% or more are about incorrect or fraudulent charging. Take this OP for example......it's 5+ years old. The complaint is about Budget charging for something the OP didn't want. Here we are 5 years later still prepaying and signing for who knows what.ovolacto seems to have prepaid which is rarely the best option. They also don't seem to know the price difference between a compact, intermediate, and standard is often only a few bucks. If people would just spend a few minutes doing some research before they commit. They would either choose another company, or, make it a point to check the amount they are being charged."
"“If people would just spend a few minutes doing some research before they commit.” - yes, that would eliminate 99% of the postings we see in this forum about hotel bookings, flight bookings, car rental bookings etc. If everybody checked the reputation first of the company they are thinking of booking with and read the T and C of the any deal/booking they are considering then they could avoid the unreliable companies, and not have false assumptions about getting refunds, and not consider themselves “victims”."
"I don't disagree, research is important, as is reading the terms before deciding, this was a very good point.But we're straying from the key difference with Budget - that they may *actively* change the contract from what was reserved, often in a way to prevent one from noticing unless very vigilant and patient.With other companies I've been asked about extras many times. When declined I've not once found those extras still in the contract. This was my first experience of an agent proactively adding extras and it being necessary to discover, request they be removed, and STILL finding them there. I passed that off as a crappy agent until I found Budget customer support to be complicit and came here to discover there were many other similar cases.A little research would certainly help one avoid being a victim of these tactics. But realistically many are here to vent - we have already learned our lesson and have accepted the money as gone. We try to gain what little we can by passing on a warning. Probably fruitless as you say, but there's literally nothing else that can be done after the fact - Budget customer service has no intention of making it right."
I'll never recommend AVIS and Budget to anyone. A few months after the trip they charged my credit card 7 times with 42 euro each for tickets admin fees. This does not include the fine itself which I should pay to the authorities. I had to pay almost 300 Euros to Avis only to give my contact info to the authorities. I tried local car rentals in other countries and never experienced such charges.

Sounds like more than one.
"This company is the WORST when it comes to rental cars. I recently reserved a car on 7/8/18 for pick up on 8/31/18 in Melbourne, FL. When my family and I arrived at the time we reserved, they told us they did not have any vehicles and the only thing we could do is call the 800 number. We called the 800 number and explained our situation regarding being in a new city WITHOUT a car and they did NOTHING to help us. After over and hour of unsuccessful attempts with other car rental companies, we were able to secure a car rental with another company. I would NEVER use this company unless you want rude customer service agents on the 800 number and to be stranded without a vehicle in a city when you need one."
"I have recently returned from Orlando and made the mistake in using Budget. After a 11 hour journey (including delays at London) we arrived at the budget desk i went to pick up the seven seater plus 3 suitcase car that I had hired from the UK.  I got a seven seater with no boat space. I spoke to the budget Rep and told her that I had four kids with one in a car seat. She told me to fold the rear seats and make four kids sit in the remaining two seats. Then she tried to get me to upgrade for an additional $700. We didn't have an option but to drive to where I was staying and raise a complaint.Also at the airport they wouldn't take visa debit and demanded cash. They also added extra charges which I did not request. My experience of budget has been totally negative and I would suggest people look at other options before looking at them. Their customer service team in the UK and US are rude, useless and have no interest in solving problems. Today a week after I returned they have charged me for tolls which I didn't use.All in all a 1 out of 10 company who I will not use again."
"I hired a Car via Rental Car with Budget in Portugal at Faro Airport for 2 weeks from 21/07/2018 to 04/08/2018, I had paid in advance £325 for a diesel, there were alot of smaller companies that were cheap but I alway go for the bigger companies. Our scheduled flight landed at 2330, we added an extra driver and hiring the toll transponder (which kept falling off the windscreen) The car was a 2017 VW Polo with lot Had a lovely holiday in the Algarve, we dropped the car off no problem. I got the charges through for the additional driver and transponder hire but was charged another £90 on top. I emailed Rental Cars and Budget but they have decided that I wasn't charged extra. The invoice was confusing they charged for the following:-Additional Driver Euro 77.74 which i am happy to payCounter product Euro 21.53Road Assistance Euro 31.37Counter Product Euro 50.92Weekly Motor Liability Charges Euro 15.40So I am presuming that Euro 21.53 was for the transponder, others have charged Euro 18.50I have been ripped off by Euro 110, I have used other rental companies like Sixt, Hertz, Avis, Guerin and Europcar and have never been over charged and they were all happy to accept that I had annual Uk Excess Insurance.I am disgusted with Budget / Avis as I confirmed verbally that I'm only being charged for an additional driver and transponder.Rental Car told me to contact my credit card company! So I won't be using them ever, also its fustrating that they were not the cheapestI"
"I rented a car at Baltimore's BWI airport and got a car with bald tires. Make sure you check the tires before accepting the car, and make sure that there is a spare tire and jack in the trunk."
"I recently rented a Budget car at Faro airport for 2 weeks.This is a warning to look out for the sharp practices that the agents at the airport use. I was pressurised in taking out their excess insurance despite already having purchased this in UK. The agent said that my insurance did not cover the loss of keys; damage to tyres, incorrect fuelling etc. This was despite me showing her that my policy did in fact cover all these points and more. She refused to accept this and I refused her insurance and she in turn got even more annoyed.Furthermore, do thoroughly check the extras that you are paying for. You do not need to activate the road charge toll device because you can pay the toll charges at many outlets. More annoying was the charge for 52 Euros for RSN. Yes RSN, nowhere in the contract does it tell you what RSN is. It is in fact Roadside Safety Net. This apparently is your roadside recovery charge and changing tyres etc. This was also covered in my own insurance, so she got me in the end.When I contacted customer services they said that because I had signed the contract reimbursement was not possible. Do look very, very closely at the extras you are charged for. We are all a bit vulnerable at the airport after a long journey and just want to get in the car on to the villa. However, a few minutes to properly check the contract before signing is time very well spent.Needless to say I will not be hiring from Avis or Budget again (they are the same group).Hope this helps someone to save a few quid."
"I recently rented from budget at Valencia airport. The agent never offered me any extras, which I would have turned down anyway, she asked me to sign a Spanish agreement and said the English one would be emailed to me. No mention still of any extras. On return of the vehicle I was informed there was €200 to pay for SDW and windscreen excess,which was added to the English document which I didn't receive until back in the UK. No apology, no refund, no communication no investigation into the unscrupulous practices of the agent involved. It is a racket! Please avoid at all cost unless you read Spanish fluently and then study the rental agreement before signing. Terrible company with terrible customer service.... multi million dollar company but won't reimburse a client €200....speaks volumes."
"Very disappointed in Budget from start to finish. The car I reserved was not there. Then I was billed for ""excessive dirt in the car"". The only thing ""excessive"" was the $75.00 they billed me for cleaning. Ii will defiantly be using another car rental agency in the future."
I had the same issue with budget. He asked me to sign something I asked and they said it’s what I already had paid . I already said no to additional insurance and when I give the car back I’ve been charged £165 for insurance I didn’t sign upFor and asked the member of staff was it an additional charge and they lied and said no.Do not go with budget honestly really sneaky and dishonest
I would like to alert any potential travellers to Bodo Norway to beware of additional charges imposed after the rental is completedI never take out the additional insurance and theft options and when I signed the agreement which was in Norwegian on pick up it was explained that the charges were the amount that I would pay if the vehicle was returned damaged or was stolen per day of the rentalI returned the vehicle undamaged on 8 August and the deposit held on my credit card was released however on 10 August I was charged an additional $286 AUD After 2 months the explanation through Rental Cars is that the charges relate to collision damage waiver and theft protection which I allegedly agreed to at rental on 2 AugustHowever while I presented my card on 2 August these alleged extras were not charged until after the rental was completed and the vehicle was returned I damaged I suggest that anyone renting a car take gear car before deciding yo use Budget/Avis Bodo as I believe that their behaviour is most unethical
"Another victim of unknown upgrades to a car rental contract!Bought my Budget Car Rental through Expedia.co.uk, with insurances CDW included.Arrived at Budget Chicago Airport to pick up my car, gave the woman my contract from Expedia.I was asked if I wanted a Toll Pass and GPS, which I replied no.Was then asked to sign and initial screen pages for the contract, as per usual.Was then asked if I wanted a two door or four door car, as I was on my own, I went for a two door.She said a Volkswagen Beetle was ready, so I said fine.On my return,,filled up tank, took back, told there was nothing to pay,,happy days!!!Got home checked my credit card, found I had been charged $304/£244 by Budget.Contacted Expedia to sort out ,thinking they had just charged me twice.Expedia came back to me and said that I had agreed 3 upgrades, car upgrade, accidental insurance and CDW.Clearly the Budget Agent had applied these upgrades without my knowledge, but like most people signed/initialed the contract screen!!I have contacted Budget, who have said that they will investigate, but I wont be holding my breath to get a satisfactory reply.So I will not use Budget again, but the real message is, make the waiting lines a little longer, and read every word of your contact before signing it, it could save you money!!"
"<<<<<On my return,,filled up tank, took back, told there was nothing to payOf course not. The optional charges you describe are charged at the start of the rental. So, you already paid. No need to read every word. Simply look at the final price. It would have been obvious in your case, Win A."

"Because 10000 and more posts (each) begs the question - how many of them were useful? How many of them were self promoting ""I'm so smart I always read every line of every contract and you should have too"" which is simply a repeat of what Win A already said. Condescending crap.What's classic is your ""blame the victim"" defense of criminals. Budget is a deceitful company plain and simple. 67 pages here of deceptive practices used to inflate contracts and many more at the BBB. How many more unreported or unnoticed? Shame on a company that uses incentives to encourage their agents to cheat and mislead their customers, and teaches their customer support team to deflect and defer to their agents.Checking the contract is too late. The best advice is: DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH CROOKS. Sure you should keep a hand on your wallet, but a pickpocket is still a criminal - it's NEVER the victims fault."

"<<<<<Checking the contract is too lateNo, it's not. Stand there and be a big boy and request the contract be re-done with the correct charges. You, as the consumer, have that power. Again, it takes 30 seconds, or less, to look at the final billing price before you leave with the car. Once home it's way too late."
"I'll try to explain it again slowly for you 10k folks.Anyone burned by budget/avis has already learned that when dealing with Bugdet's agents the contract must be examined very closely as many of them are dishonest. Many posters here say just that (had hawkeye bothered to read).""You could have avoided this by reading the contract"" is at best redundant. But in truth it's a disgusting misuse of social media, a vain (both meanings) attempt to make the topic about yourself, trying to show us how smart you are because you already know to read the contract. How many of your 10K posts are like that?An honest company doesn't deliberately change the contract before you sign it. They give you what you ordered. And when there's a mistake, they make it right. Budget has on many occasions shown they are not that type of company.You really want to help? Warn people IN ADVANCE of companies that use dishonest tactics (like most of us in this thread have tried to do). Coach people on how to recover their money after budget has stolen it (complaints to the BBB seem more effective than using their customer service). Skip the ""you should have closed the barn door"" homespun advice, you only embarrass yourself. Stay quiet rather than removing all doubt.And no, it's not just one company. I've also warned about TIM's tourist pass scam here. I'll warn about any travel related company with poor or deceptive practices that I encounter. And I've called out shills who try to say it's not the company, it's the victim's fault for not reading. But I've never once posted an ""I'm smarter than you"" message on any board. I've got better things to do than rack up my post count."
"No, knowingly dealing with crooks at all is the mistake - I'll take my business elsewhere. Dealing with crooks and thinking you're smart by inspecting the contract carefully is foolish. If they're trying to cheat in front of your face what do you think is happening behind the scenes? If they don't get you up front they'll try get you some other way, dishonest is dishonest."
"1) I said many not all. Many means it's a management problem, admitted by budget more than 2 years ago and never addressed. An easy fix - cancel incentives until proper training and oversights are in place. Clearly they don't care.2) I'll take your word for it. This thread is about ""Budget Car Rental"". Are they one of the worse vs better?3) Sounds good, and phrased much better than the past tense ""you should have read the contract dummy"" self promotional posts.The posts here and at the BBB prove the point about budget over and over. Complain about the others if you want, I couldn't care less, no obsession here. Is there a long thread like this for each of them too? What shouldn't happen is defending the practice by blaming the victims no matter how easily the scam is avoided."

"Explaining a wrong thing many times doesn't make it less wrong. Stop saying it and I'll stop correcting you. The paraphrases make it simple for those not getting it.Here you go from hawkeye:""would have been obvious"" - past tense, implication of failure, lack of character, e.g. not a ""big boy"". AKA victim blaming. Which implies condoning the agents behavior - it's up to the victim to beware.""No need to read every word"" - plain wrong. The offer states there may be additional charges that are legitimate, e.g. airport location fees so you can't just look at the total. Agents slip in other charges implying they're mandatory too. Read every word.Win A already knows now to check the contract and not leave till it's right. As does anyone else reading any of these experiences.The total value of hawkeye's post: ZERO. Self promotional back patting and post counting. Stop posting like this and I'll stop calling you out.""Scams are pervasive in the rental car industry"". Do you mean companies like Avis, Dollar, Thrifty, and PayLess? The ones under legal investigation for these practices? They're all owned by Budget/Avis."

"""Less happy when people use TA to rant about their bad experience""""Yes, I’d rather people find out how to avoid problems rather than complaining about them after the fact. That’s my personal preference.""I'd call that self aggrandizing. This board is not about you and making you happy. It's definitely not healthy to have an emotional attachment to it.Most posts here are not complaints nor rants. They're *direct* experiences and warnings that many budget agents mislead and defraud their customers. These posters should not be belittled as ranters nor deflected with motherhood advice by those that have NOT had that experience."

"This is the Budget Car Rental topic with focus on the deceptive behavior of their agents. It's ok, if you find yourself confused again you can look at the top of the page - the title and OP's message is right there.When you suggested deceptive agent behavior was pervasive the question was whether you meant in general or were being specific to the Avis/Budget group as they're the target of a legal investigation. I can understand your dilemma - Budget has by far the vast majority of complaints here on TA, it's much harder to find others. Doesn't provide for you many other opportunities to plug or defend Avis."
BUDGET CAR RENTALI would agree with all of this as the same happend to me at LAX. Best advice ever is just stick with your pre booking and never pay any extra to what you have already paid. Or even better never use Budget

"Without wishing to get involved in an argument I think it's worth pointing out that at some locations Avis & Budget share pick-up locations, so it's the same agents handling both."
"True. Not everyone spends so much time here though, you shouldn't let it bother you. At least the more we talk about it the higher the warning gets in google searches. And there are some good tips here on how to get your money back in addition to these many warnings of being extra cautious with the contract details when dealing with budget. Plus when folks do check here and discover how common this fraud is they might chose to fight back vs accepting it as their own fault for signing. When contacting Budget customer service directly this is the first thing they say to convince you to let it go. If enough push back that it affects their business perhaps they'll stop doing it."
"Yep, and it's not all of the agents either... ""And some, I assume, are good people"" ;). Up till that last experience my budget rentals were fine. The issue here is that Budget has admitted they have a problem but does nothing to address it - a conscious management/leadership decision. This discussion convinced me to fight with them till I got my refund. *That's* why the victim blaming as a deflection needs to be a hot button - hopefully more people will force them to do the right thing."
"Sure, nobody has ever disputed the need to verify the contract, it was in the very first post as you've quoted.The objection is to continually repeating it to people who complain here. The ones who have already had their harsh lesson with Budget. I'm still puzzled why you feel compelled to do this, and especially why you feel happy when you do so.Anyone who's fallen prey to this scam should be encouraged to seek compensation, not discouraged by reinforcing the excuse budget is already using on them.You did say ""caveat emptor"". You believe Budget is acting ethically, that they deserve the extra revenue and their agents the commission? That victims should suck it up and stop ranting, it's their own fault for not reading? If you'd even once encouraged someone here to recover the funds it wouldn't look so much like blaming.That this is victim blaming may be something you're not able to understand. Don't feel bad, it is a subtle thing. It's enough that you're helping to get the warning out by keeping the discussion alive."

"This isn't a debate. It's a vehicle for exposing budget's fraudulent agent practices.Finally you agree that these folks have been wronged, that B is appropriate. That's very good progress. Yet you prefer restating A each time to remind them of their past mistake. And you never suggest B to help them move forward. Punishment for (as you said) making you unhappy by failing to seek your advice first rather than ""ranting"" later?I'm sorry to hear about your memory problems. You can use the page number links to reread older posts. Perhaps you will find someone suggesting to NOT check the contract to use for your ""debate""."
"This *topic* is about Budget Car Rental ""to warn fellow travellers of this sharp practice and tell them always, always check what you;re signing"", i.e. exposing deliberate fraud by some Budget agents and recommending reading carefully. The ""vehicle"" keeping this thread alive is you reacting. That's ok by me, and of course post whatever you want.Certainly they all try to upsell. This discussion is about the ones that misrepresent the contract contents. I'm sorry for your experience, most of my experiences have been fine - refuse the upsell and receive a contract that matches the reservation. I've only ever had Budget's agent misrepresent a contract, not just once but also for the re-write. Many here have had a similar experiences including the OP. There is *no* other rental agency with this many complaints on TA. With your countless hours of posting experience you already know that. Why then help Budget convince folks it was their own fault by obsessively reposting ""A"" rather than encouraging ""B""?"
"<There is *no* other rental agency with this many complaints on TA. >100% laughable. Have you even stopped to consider some of us actually have a broader scope than you. For a car rental agency, maybe look up Gold Car. Probably the #1 most “ranted” upon agency in all TA forums. Hands down."

"So there it is: you see a ""debate"" here because anyone who DARES criticize a post from the 10K club has failed ""to consider some of us actually have a broader scope than you"".There is no other debate, we agree on the key points: that one should carefully read and agree before signing a contract, and that some agents will misrepresent the content of the contract with the hope that you do not.A post that criticizes a victim (you should have read before signing) without condemning the perpetrator is the DEFINITION of victim blaming. Worse, you're helping customer service discourage the complaint - that's why some question your motives.Whether or not you understand it or meant it, victim blaming posts need to be called out."
"Mike P: See, that's the thing about this forum - anyone is entitled to their opinion - but not their facts. The fact is you called out a statistic that Budget posts were the majority on TA forums - and that fact is incorrect, 100%. Then you proceed with your banter about victim blaming, etc. I never blamed you or your mistake - I called out an incorrect fact you made. Period."
"Point taken bk_t1, gold car is certainly awful, and my research was not thorough.And I apologize for seeming to imply you were victim blaming, I don't recall that from you. The comments were directed at hawkeye and smushie.A toilet is inanimate smushie, there's no perpetrator there there. You haven't quite grasped the concept."

"The extra insurance sounds like a deliberate misrepresentation on the part of the agent.It's quite possible the other charges are incorrect, at the very least you can compare the receipt to the contract to see if the return date/time matches, and whether the rental length on the contract was different from your reservation.Budget customer service will try to convince you it was your fault for signing which is not true (it was a mistake to sign, but it was their agent that was cheating). The best you can hope for if you persist and escalate is an apology for ""any misunderstanding between you and the agent"" and a partial refund.The most success appears to come from complaining to the BBB. On other social media you may get a response like ""contact us directly and we'll sort it out"" but many come back to say Budget did nothing."
I posted the same review 2 years ago when we visited Kissimmee so the same sharp practice is still going on I got the same response from Budget also this year at Malaga with a company called Firefly
"FoxyGurl,Unfortunately you learned a lesson the hard way. It's not just Budget, no matter what company you rent with you need to read your contract to make sure extra charges are not added. No matter how much of a hurry you are in you have to read what you are being charged. The fact that an agent told you something is very difficult to prove. It sounds like the agent bullied you into taking the insurance. If that's the case they really didn't add anything extra. You agreed to it, although it was under false circumstances.Rental periods run for 24 hours. So for example if you picked up the vehicle at 2pm it would have to be returned by 2pm to avoid an extra day's charge. The time of pick up and return is set when you reserve, so I really can't understand how that misunderstanding happened. If you reserved the vehicle based on your return flight time any charges for that time should have been in the original estimate of charges.As for tolls, did you go through a toll? If so you would be charged and most if not all rental car companies charge what many consider exorbitant fees for tolls."
"The one advantage we (victims) have is that this is not a criminal case, proof of agent misbehavior is not required. Certainly no one suspects these customers have asked the agent for extra insurance, accepted it, then denied it later in an attempt to defraud Budget's insurance. Especially for the cases where the driver is already insured. The original quote serves as evidence as well.Signing was a mistake and a good lesson but the fault lies with the agent - seeking a refund is certainly appropriate."
"<I got the same response from Budget also this year at Malaga with a company called Firefly>johnjoewood: That’s interesting.... since Firefly is not owned by Budget, they are owned by Hertz. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(car_rental)"
"We reserved, and paid for a convertible, 3 weeks prior to a trip to California. On arrival at the rental counter, we were informed there was no convertible available. Counter staff was not helpful-their goal was to get us into any car and away from the counter. They said WE could call other Budget offices to see if we could trade for the car we had reserved and paid for. Budget's ""customer service"" line was not helpful, and at times downright rude. They tried to tell us the hardtop we got was an ""upgrade"". Eventually (3 days later) we called a budget office at Santa Rosa, and were able to trade our car for a convertible. Throughout the process, Budget was dismissive and unhelpful. DO NOT use them, if you must, DO NOT prepay."
"I can sympathize with you as we just discover the hard way an extra charge by Budget Miami Int'l Airport. Our situation is quite simple - we have been lied to when signing the document. The ""salesman"" at the front desk suggested that we should have RSN package and that we would only get charged if we were to use the package. This behaviour is totally unacceptable and I am convinced that the ""salesman"" is encouraged by his management to practice this kind of trick. Unacceptable - this means as well that you cannot trust any of these companies as we had previously something similar with Avis."
Budget is trying to cheat me as well!Rented a car for TWO WEEKS and noticed that there was a blinking warning on the dash. When I asked the rep. about it he had no idea what it was either. I took the car home (6 miles) and looked the warning up - something to do with tires. I called but the office was closed. Took the car back the next morning and they said they couldn't fix the warning light. I left the car and went to HERTZ when BUDGET stated that my contract still applied and the CROOKS CHARGED ME OVER $360.00!!! EVEN THOUGH THE CAR HAD ONLY 12 MILES ON IT!STAY AWAY FROM THESE CROOKS!
"Nice. And if something had happened to the tires while you were driving they would have charged you for that instead...While it's certainly true you should not leave until the contract and the car is to your satisfaction, the question becomes how long you're willing to wait until it's so. Because if you run out of patience or time and they have your card number they may still charge you even if you give up and get transportation somewhere else. More so if you've signed the contract only to find a problem with the car that they refuse to sort.Budget customer service will NOT make it right without a lot of unnecessary effort on your part."
When I rented the car I did not start the engine . . .I figured that the car was checked and SERVICED and ready to rent! I called my credit card and disputed Budget's dishonest claim that I owed them for a defective car they rented. CROOKS like this should be looked into by the BBB and not allowed to franchise their kind of business in every state.
The BBB does not prevent businesses from operating. They merely report complaints. Consumers are supposed to check with the BBB before they use a business.
"Right, check first and/or complain afterward as the BBB can't force a resolution.Using the BBB does appear to be a better path to resolution of a complaint. Probably because it's more public than their internal department which will attempt to rebuff or deflect.The BBB does seem to initiate a legal actions in some cases, for example against payless specifically and Budget/Avis as a group: https:/….The BBB has been successful in some cases: https:/…detailsBut Budget seems to be continuing the practices as seen from this community. And there are indications it's deliberate, ex employees have admitted many of the practices reported here: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-colum…Naive to think it's only that one location given how similar they are to the broader complaints here on TA."
"Our experience was ""similar"". We rented a car in Denver, CO on an emergency basis because our granddaughter was in the Intensive Care Unit. I prepaid online, but before I made the reservation, I called twice to ask about getting a refund if we returned the car earlier than the ""proposed"" date, Dec. 27, 2018. I was told that we WOULD get a refund if we brought it back early. At the rental agency in Denver Dec. 21, we were given a receipt for the full amount. I called Budget Customer Service this morning, Dec. 22, to ask about getting a refund and was told that all prepaid cars never got a refund. Since I had called BEFORE I rented the car, and they said I WOULD be refunded, I assumed Budget would stick to their word. We have rented from Budget for at least 25-30 years. We are extremely disappointed in their lack of integrity when this was an emergent visit and not a simple vacation trip. We will no longer be needing their services, and will make sure our friends and relatives know what happened."
"Prepaid reservations are almost always non-refundable. Had you clicked on the ""policies"" button right next to the ""Buy"" button you would have seen.....*If you return the vehicle before the original return date (early return), you will not be refunded any portion of the payment.Budget, Hertz, Alamo, they all have the same policy- no refund for early return. It's a very standard policy for prepaids."
"You'll need to ignore the folks with so many posts here they've become self absorbed and arrogant. Offended that you haven't read every word they've posted before you dared leave home they get back at you by victim blaming.Clearly, because you called before booking, the agents that answered were either lying, wrong, or promising you an exception. Since an agent is by definition an expert on and represents company policies only the last is relevant (though the others are quite likely given Budget's reputation).Budget's customer service is focused on deflecting/discouraging complaints so you'll probably need to take your complaint somewhere more visible if you'd like a refund - you certainly deserve one. Complaining to the BBB seems to be effective."
"Yeah Mike those pesky folks who recite the terms and conditions of the contract. I know Budget reps should be better trained and can't be relied on for accurate information, so the solution is to read the terms and conditions and not rely on what reps tell you. There won't be any proof of what was said in the conversation.I also understand the position of never wanting to rent from them again. That's what I would do if someone gave me the wrong information."

"If you don't like what I write, ask yourself why you feel so compelled to read it let alone respond.Harassment? Compared to actual verbal abuse - name calling, accusations of drug use, etc? Pointing out a victims mistake (you should have read the T&Cs) without condemning the agents mistake (it's their *job* to know what the customer is asking) is exactly victim blaming. Whether or not you understand it or mean it.This is trip *advisor*. I've offered *advice* for how someone wronged might proceed. Telling someone what they've done wrong when they've already acknowledged it, when they can't go back in time to fix it, and when there are already many warnings here to read the T&Cs, is NOT advice. It's self promotion."
"The poster said ""I called Budget Customer Service this morning, Dec. 22, to ask about getting a refund and was told that all prepaid cars never got a refund.""Hawkeye simply repeated that information. Repetition is not advice. Nor is ""advice"" offered after the fact.Worse, he's seemingly offering an expert opinion to confirm budget's position - that it's the customer's fault for not reading the T&Cs. That's victim blaming, and it's *wrong* because it discourages the victim from seeking compensation. He's doing the job of Budget's CS for them.The victim certainly deserves compensation given what they wrote. I *advised* the poster to ignore the victim blaming and suggested how they might get that compensation. That's not harassment. In fact I was deflecting hawkeye's harassment. Why do some TA high level posters jump to victim blaming so quickly?"
"What a load of bs, Mike.It's quite simple. No need for so much confusion from you.There is no ""victim"" here. It was a prepaid non-refundable reservation. They got a slightly discounted rate for agreeing to those specific dates and times. Not getting a refund for that non-refundable reservation does not make anyone a victim.Edited: 1 year ago "
"So your position is the poster is lying? Based on what? ""I called twice to ask about getting a refund if we returned the car earlier than the ""proposed"" date, Dec. 27, 2018. I was told that we WOULD get a refund if we brought it back early.""Whether the two Budget agents misled, lied, were mistaken, misunderstood the question, or promised a refund they did not deliver, they did not do their job and the poster is entitled to a refund. Don't bully the posters into accepting it as their own fault. Help them sort it or leave it alone. Budget doesn't need your help."

"We don’t know #721’s full story. So while one poster labels us, my guess is details have been left out. Was the poster clearly upfront on the phone with Budget, that their upcoming reservation would be non-refundable? Maybe the reservation was made through a 3rd party? If details were left out - then how can anyone presume guilt or innocence or monies owned. In most situations there are 3 versions of the truth - what I said, what you heard, and the true facts. I suspect we’ll never hear back from him."
"Rather arrogant to assume to assume a poster is lying without some kind of evidence don't you think? Seems better to give advice here with a presumption of honesty. You can always preface advice with ""given what was written"", the truth will sort itself out.Assuming the poster is lying and siding with Budget seems especially harsh, more so to someone with a sick grandchild.You'll need to research victim blaming on your own smushie, you're still not grasping it. Don't feel bad. Very sad to see TA has many, many instances of it. You might find it illuminating to note what type of posters do it the most, and why.I hope you both feel better after your rants. I expect it feels good to hear a confirmation from like minded people. Try to remember one of the values of travel is to experience other points of view - an echo chamber might feel better but it's not a path to growth. Did you to figure out why what I write bothers you so much you feel compelled to read and respond?"

"""In most situations there are 3 versions of the truth - what I said, what you heard, and the true facts. I suspect we’ll never hear back from him.""Well stated bk."
"Yes, I heard you the first time hawkeye. The question so entirely misses the point of the discussion that I was trying to let it drop gracefully, but since you've pressed:The problem has *never* been the correctness of your ""read the contract"" comments, we've all agreed it's best to only sign if in agreement with the content.The *problem* is the completely inappropriate timing of your attempts to advise. When the poster says that Budget told them prepaid reservations are not refundable, repeating that back while totally ignoring the actions of Budget's agents comes across as blaming the victim for falling for Budget's tactics. As well as being so repetitious it's useless. And since you're confirming budget's position you appear to be aligning yourself with them for some reason.Sure it's useful to reiterate that advice, on it's own it is quite sound. Is it so tough to be more thoughtful and diplomatic when you do? I get that you're exasperated because none of the complainants seems to listen to you beforehand, you need to get over it.Budget has both admitted and been caught misleading their customers on many occasions - they can indeed be judged and assuming they're in the wrong IS better than disbelieving posters who don't have that same track record.Self appointing yourselves as the judges of truth in posting isn't a good path if you use it to rationalize refusing to help someone - esp if there's any chance they have a grandchild in intensive care and the budget agents did mislead them."
>Self appointing yourselves as the judges of truth in posting isn't a good path if you use it to rationalize refusing to help someone - esp if there's any chance they have a grandchild in intensive care and the budget agents did mislead them.<Mike P: You did the exact same thing... self-appointed yourself as the prosecutor because you took all the items listed in said “rant” as truth. We do not know the truth and your presumption of innocence standard is invalid. (Not sure why you chose to change your name)...
"Well, no, that's not accurate. I suggested we should presume innocence, even toward Budget - granting it might have been a misunderstanding. I prefaced with: ""as written"", which should be implicit/understood in any case. Nor do I always side against Budget - I had nothing to say about the poster with the traffic tickets, I think Budget was correct there - at least as the post was written :).This particular argument came about from this (again as written):The poster says: ""I was told that we WOULD get a refund"" twice, by two different agents.Then later was told: ""...that all prepaid cars never got a refund"".Hawkeye *advises* that for prepaid: ""...you will not be refunded..."". Tell me how this helps? It's not new information for the poster. What action other than ""give up"" does it suggest? It appears only to be partisan support for budget. I jumped in (as prosecutor?) because ""as written"" Budget misled the poster (maybe an accident but agents are presumed experts/advisory) and advised the poster *should* complain (assuming they're being truthful).Presuming guilt is a dangerous path. But honestly, after hawkeye's rather ham handed question to me I feel bad, he clearly doesn't understand. Smushie is a bit closer but still not quite there either. I'll think I'll take my own advice and be more diplomatic here (whether you all help them on other topics you can decide for yourself).L8257VDmikep is my real name, I finally got around to fixing it :)... actually it was some sort of TA forum glitch, I didn't change it myself."

"Unfortunately inaccurate.#1 It's an agent's *job* to understand the customer's question, to ask if it's not clear, and to advise: ""except if you prepay"". A customer is calling for help. If the agent fails it's Budget's responsibility.#2 With Budget poor agent training and oversight is proven (by legal investigation) and admitted (by a letter of admission and a promise to retrain, and on the BBB complaint boards), so can be presumed when it's asserted by a poster. It's not my job to prove it further, nor prove a poster is lying (is it yours?).#3 My harsh responses to hawkeye were because his advice were so often useless to the poster when given, and because it came across both as victim blaming and very partisan - as if intended to discourage the pursuit of a complaint. Too harsh now that I realize he doesn't understand.#4 I have never once defended the practice of failing to read a contract before signing, and have acknowledged it's a mistake. I *have* called out the deplorable practice of Budget agents deliberately misleading customers, deceptively padding contracts, and verbally misrepresenting what's written (from my direct experience as well as reports by others). I completely agree they cannot to be trusted and it's important to read every line before signing.#5 I posted to warn of what I thought was a single bad agent in Rome and warn that it's a mistake to do anything to get away from a bad agent because that Budget CS will back them up. Only to discover this deplorable practice was pervasive throughout Budget and Budget CS. That was not my first post and certainly not why I created my account. BTW, you do realize we can visit and read without creating an account, right?"

"It's the agent's job to ask and confirm, to not do so is evidence of poor training. In the case that you quote a price difference would be a good reason for a properly trained agent to check. As written the poster likely called twice because of the T&Cs they were reading online. Two agents failed to catch that.There's no contradiction here, the presumption of innocence applies to wrongdoing (a lie or a deliberate attempt to mislead) vs a presumption of failure / poor training which is self evident and self admitted by Budget. Presumption of failure is sufficient, proof of wrongdoing was not necessary in this case.It is certainly my opinion that it's often deliberate based on my own experience, so many anecdotes, and published legal actions. I don't need proof to have an opinion. But I would want proof before accusing a poster, with no previous track record, of lying."
"Yep. Really more than one bad experience. The first with the bad agent that I would have shrugged off as an exception. It was the multiple experiences dealing with Budget Customer Service including calls with a supervisor before getting my refund that solidified my opinion. And then reading of so many similar experiences from others, the news reports, and BBB warnings. A definite pattern even if I dismiss half the complaints as lies (which I do not).But you're deflecting - the real issue is the forum responses that *appear* to be echoing Budget CS's defense of poor agent behavior and intended to discourage posters from lodging a complaint. I cannot understand why experienced forum participants would do this (other than hawkeye where it's clear now)."
Well then Mike the best thing to do is to move on. Learn nothing from your experience. Start using other rental car companies. Then when you get burned again come back on and tell us how unjustly you were treated by xyz rental. Will that make you feel better?
"Thanks for the advice, and nice of you to consider my feelings. But it's ok, I'm just answering smushie's questions and correcting him when necessary. No hard feelings on my part. And I'm certainly allowed to offer advice here even if it's contrary to what others think.This wasn't my first car rental from budget let alone other companies. When I do have another bad travel experience I will certainly come to TA to warn others. Of course not on this thread since this one is specifically about Budget."

"Yes, I had 3 or 4 from Budget previously that were ok. I've never had a problem with many, many more from hertz nor with a handful from uhaul. This was my first bad experience with any rental, and it became clear from Budget customer service that their problems/scams were supported. Personally I never return once mistreated. But my own experience isn't that relevant...Those are good tips. Maybe better in a general thread, but anyway, a few more:Prepaying can be a problem if you find yourself at a bad agent, branch, or agency, or they don't have the vehicle you reserved. You can't just walk away.Booking through a 3rd party seems to make it more difficult to resolve issues.Keep the final gas receipt in case they run the fuel scam.Rent from agencies with newer cars and good tires. If you don't take the roadside assistance and insurance you're responsible for any breakdown.One has me stumped: Agencies may apply additional charges even after the car has been returned and the bill settled (as per the rental contract). The Budget windshield chip scam in Vancouver was doing this.It's easy to dispute duplicate charges through the bank, extra charges are much more difficult - unlikely the bank will review your photos. Seems safer to select a rental agency with good customer service."
"There is a thread I started a long while back on Car Rental Tips. People sometimes use that thread for rants, but it’s meant for upfront advice. My ONE single piece of upfront advice is to join the loyalty club for your rental agency. Most, if not all, rentals will then include minimal or no human interaction on the checkout side. The best part, it’s free to join. No lines, etc. Of course, I book direct always."

"We booked a rental in Orlando a year ago, and had an excellent experience with the agent, so we decided to use Budget again for a similar rental this year, Res. #41403748US1. What a mistake! The agent, 86509, was rude, pushy, and a liar! He pressured us to take Budget's insurance, after expensive research with our insurance broker, Amica, made us confident that this was not required or advisable, did not listen, and kept adding pressure, trying to make us believe we would be foolish not to take the extra insurance. Next, we asked if the vehicle we were assigned had built-in GPS, he lied and told us that it may or may not have it, butin any case the in-car unit were ""generally not reliable"", and sold us the android unit, which was far less reliable than the built-in unit! We agreed to take the android unit, as we are not familiar with the route, it was late at night, and our route took us through a busy highway with major road upgrades in progress. At the very least, we feel that Budget should reimburse us for the cost of the GPS rental charge of $133.97. I sincerely believe that the attitude of the agent is detrimental to the image and reputation of Budget, and will hesitate to use your service for future rentals."
"True about the need to tolerate/ignore poor agents, in fact I might even have used Budget at FCO again (though I would have refused to deal with that same agent) if not for the poor response from Budget customer service. My view is similar to yours in that they all will have bad agents/branches/franchises. But if CS won't fix it I won't take the chance. The suggestion to use the loyalty program is my favorite - avoiding human interaction is best for ornery folks like me and probably the reason why I've never had trouble with hertz.@Axabum, your comments appear to be for Budget directly and I suspect they do not monitor this forum. They do have a customer service contact link on their site."
"Italy,rented a car from them in december,when i did booking choose mandatory winter fees and insurance,on arrival they said no winter tyres on car because it was a location with not wo much snow,but i was going in mountains.they asked 300€ extra only for tyres for my initial booking witch was 170£ 9 days,and insurance anoyher 300€ because they only come with standard fire and theft cover and no accident cover.when i did the booking it was completly different specifications.the most ridiculous thing was at drop off.car had 3/4 full tank.so need to put about 10€at a petrol station to br full.they asked 40€ to add to be full because of refueling fees.be carefull when droping off.better add yourself full tank in a station. NEVER USE AGAIN!!!!!!!"
"**mandatory winter fees**= snow chains in the trunk, not snow tires. Post 758 wanted tires so it cost them extra.As for the insurance, I'm sure they were asked to have a hold put on their card, which they refused so they had to buy additional insurances.For the fuel, poster 758 YOU are responsible to return the car full, not 3/4 full. It's not just the cost of the fuel but the time the car is out of service and having an attendant leave what they're doing to take it and fill it up.Ridiculous rant over nothing. Next time read the terms and conditions and know what you're responsible for.....like returning the car full.Donna"
"Budget Rome, Termini.Employee: ""For a promotion valid only on the Christmas holiday for you the ""Super Cover Protection!"" insurance is free!""Me: ""Ok, thanks, how come I see an higher amount on the contract?""Employee: ""Do not worry that amount will be returned to you when the vehicle is back""At the end of the rental they charged me the insurance, saying that there was no such promotion and that I had misunderstood.Reading comments from people who had to pay big money for little scratches not caused from them, I feel myself lucky Avoid these cheaters!"
"I want people to know about how Budget puts holds on your Credit Card, then when you return the car, they bill your credit card for the total amount and the holds are still on your Credit Card for over a month. This happened twice (you would think I would have learned). I thought the first time it was an error, but the second time it happened again. Budget put a hold on my credit card when I first rented the car in TPA 1039.00, when I returned it there was a difference of 432.00, then they put the total charge of 1953.00, but the hold of 1039 & 432 is still on the credit card. Spent over an hour speaking to them to send a fax to my bank. They stated they faxed it over, but calls to my bank had never received the faxes. I told them to email it, but they refused Never again will I use Budget. The holds are on the account till the end of January. They made sure they got paid plus kept my holds!!! I would call this fraud!"
"Sounds lazy and a poor practice but I don't understand how it's fraud? Is there an advantage to Budget to keep the old holds in place?Post 760 was clear fraud and it's disturbing that management (at that branch) did nothing. He probably wasn't the only victim that ""misunderstood"" the promotion so they must have been aware. Hopefully he took it up with Budget customer service (who will probably do nothing but ask the branch who will deny, and close the complaint after a few weeks). Best to complain publicly to the BBB, FB, etc., and you might get a refund. Budget (and any other company like it) should be forced to have a process in place to prevent agents from cheating - customers need to complain loudly."
"Everyone please be very careful of this car rental ( Avis too as they are together). Even when you decline the additional insurance 3 or 4 times and the lady at the counter says ok no additional insurance, takes back the paperwork and generates new paperwork that she says right to your face has no additional insurance charges she slips it in between the declined items in very fine print!. So they lie right to your face! At 1 am you expect them to honor their agreement and be honest with you not to lie and slip the charge in again. When you call and complain they give you a token 30% back and tell you well you had it so you pay for it. What a scam. I even have a witness to the counter lady saying she was taking it off. Liar, liar. Don't use them or if you do watch the fine lines on the right of the contract and make sure each on says declined. They do not hire honest counter people. January 2019"
"I flew into Lima and had planned to drive from Lima to Paracas. I went onto kayak.com to book my rental and received my kayak.com booking confirmation for a Budget rental car.My flight was delayed 2 hours and subsequently my reservation was canceled and Budget gave up my car rental to someone else. In that exact moment, I navigated to the Budget.com website and saw availability and booked a NEW reservation. YES... I am able to book a new reservation. Yet, no cars are available. How and why do you give the ability to book new reservations when you do NOT have any cars available?  I asked the customer service rep why the corporate online website shows availability and also why it gives me the ability to reserve ANOTHER car, when apparently there are no cars available? He said, ""the website is wrong"".I was stranded at the airport. Budget is the WORST."
"Been ripped off by Budget / Avis Car Hire Faro Airport in July 2018, They over charged by 95 Euros, added extras that other companies include at time of booking will recommend Guerin, Europcar and Sixt. Did book through Rentalcars.com, left review but they removed it."
"A few days ago I wrote about the bad experience below. I am pleased to report that after several phone calls and postings I received a response from Budget. Again, after a few IM's and emails the error has been corrected. But I still stress read the fine print even if they tell you something to your face.Everyone please be very careful of this car rental ( Avis too as they are together). Even when you decline the additional insurance 3 or 4 times and the lady at the counter says ok no additional insurance, takesback the paperwork and generates new paperwork that she says right to your face has no additional insurance charges she slips it in between the declined items in very fine print!.

"I rented a car from Budget at the Denver International Airport on December the 5th with a drop off on the 9th. My experience with Budget was HORRIBLE!!!! The first car that was given to me was filthy inside and out. The second car that was given to me had many dings on the outside of thecar AND there were many rock dings on the wind shield with a big crack in the wind shield. The third car that was given to me was ok UNTIL we noticed a slow leak in the tire. We, of course, filled the tire with air not thinking anymore about it. The morning we were scheduled to take the car back we noticed the tire was completely flat. I called Budget and the lady gave me a number to call for roadside assistance. AT NO TIME DID SHE SAY THERE WOULD BE A CHARGE FOR THIS ASSISTANCE!!! Now a MONTH after the fiasco with your company, I receive a letter stating I would be charged a roadside fee AND an administrative fee. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE company. I will NEVER rent cars from Budget again"

"I'm not sure if anyone knows who you're yelling at... it's usually better to quote the post or post number that you find offensive. And you should probably make sure it was directed at you, there's a lot of discussion here."
"Bad service and they have so many extra charges.... don't go there, I am really disappointed."
"I just returned from Aruba. I rented a car from BUDGET for 12 days. Although it was more money I was told by Budget that there was no charge for a spouse if they were the additional driver. When I got there they told me there was a charge for my spouse! Ok, so I paid it. Took the car. WHAT a JUNKBOX! I have been going to Aruba for many years and always get a car. This was my first time with Budget. Car must of had 200 dings in it. They took pictures of all the dings be it went out. Don't know know why. If there were 50 more dings it would of looked the same. But the REAL PROBLEM was the front wheel. I don't know if the bearing were gone or what. I was afraid of the tire falling off. I almost went back to get another car but didn't want to spend a couple of hours getting a new car. I didn't see another rental while I was there that looked as bad as mine.I will never rent from Budget again. Worse car rental experience I ever had."
"I also was not happy with budget. We had to wait more than 30 minutes to even get our rental (of which we had a reservation). That being said, my husband may not have listened to all of the instructions because he was frustrated with the wait time, or maybe the lady didn't explain it, but our major issue was fuel. We had every intention to fill the tank at the airport exit, only to find out there were no gas stations at the exit!!! NONE!!! I found the closest station was 10 minutes in the opposite direction. So because we had a plane to catch we opted not to spend the extra 30 minutes out of our way to fill the tank and we would just pay the fee. If we knew what the fee was we never would have made that decision. I assumed the company would just recoup their cost on fuel with a normal upcharge. NOPE! The fuel bill was more than our rental of the car!!! Is it just me or is that absolutely ridiculous? I expected $30 or $40 for fuel (I'm sure it only cost $20 or less to fill it) but our fuel bill came in at $92.91! If they are going to charge prices like that I think they need to make it way more clear that bringing a car back empty really is not an option!!!Edited: 1 year ago "
">>If they are going to charge prices like that I think they need to make it way more clear that bringing a car back empty really is not an option!!!<<It was in the paperwork and likely in the instructions your husband neglected to listen to. You made the decision to not prepare yourself and find a fuel station in advance - but wait until you pulled into the airport, why is this Budget's fault??"
If we are playing assumption bingo I think Turner wins.
"No I had similar experience at Orlando airport at 2 am in morning on Feb 15th 2019. They offered me jeep wrangler when I reserved a regular car from budget.com . I had baby with me and had to refuse the jeep wrangler. The counter person by name Viorel told me that don't have any other vehicle than the jeep. He said he can cancel the reservation and there will not be any charge.I cancelled the reservation went to Avis desk and got a rental car from them.Now, it didn't end with that,... after my trip I found out that they charged my credit card with full amount!!! WTF???When I called the customer support they told the reservation is not cancelled.Don't book with Budget... I never had such experience when I did booking with enterprise, avis or dollar..."
>>I cancelled the reservation went to Avis desk and got a rental car from them.<<sgaonkar: You do realize that Avis owns Budget....
"Sort of misses the point a bit, right? sgaonkar went to avis because budget didn't have the vehicle type that was promised, not out of protest. The complaint & warning here is the Budget agent did not cancel the reservation as requested/promised/appropriate and the customer was still charged. Perhaps merely incompetence, but wow it sure happens a lot at Budget counters - very poor training at the least. At worst deliberate...True the end of the recommendation mentions Avis again. Though I also get the sense that poor/dishonest service is more ingrained into the culture at Budget than Avis."
">>True the end of the recommendation mentions Avis again. Though I also get the sense that poor/dishonest service is more ingrained into the culture at Budget than Avis.<<L8257VDmikep: Actually poor/dishonest service is ingrained in people, irrespective of who they work for. I work to skip talking to reps by joining loyalty programs (for free). In the case where I do speak with a rep, I understand my rental details and conditions before walking up, and I read all my paperwork. At the end of the day sgaonkar won't be back to explain any more... they joined, they posted/ranted, they're gone."
"If you're sure sgaonkar won't be back why respond directly :)?Your advice is sound but doesn't apply to this case. Certainly bypass the line, but if the car you find in the slot is unsuitable you don't take it. You have no choice but to deal with an agent. If they don't have an acceptable vehicle as reserved (in this case child safe) AND the agent states they will cancel without charge the original T&C's no longer apply. The agent was incompetent or it was deliberate fraud.(I'm sorry for your experience with people in general. I've certainly met some bad people too but I've met many more who were competent and helpful)."
The line for Budget wa so long at the Fort Lauderdale car rental. It took 90 minutes to get our prepaid car. We also had the problem with the toll charge. We paid $26.00 instead of $3.95 for one toll booth.
"I rented from Budget and picked up in Miami airport. We waited 2+ hours to reach the counter. We were told by the lady helping us she would get us to our car as quickly as possible. She asked if we needed any additional coverages for liability or insurance, we verbally declined. Only to find later on our invoice that she went ahead and added it anyways. We were in a rush getting out of there as we were already delayed 2 hours on our travel plans so we did not review the invoice at the time. DEFINITELY REVIEW YOUR INVOICE BEFORE LEAVING RENTAL CAR AREA. The lady sneakily skipped over the section where we had to sign off on the coverage and just instructed us to sign at the bottom of the contract. This helped to our advantage when disputing the additional charges for coverages we declined as there was no initial beside the section. Budget did refund us for the charges after 2 calls, an email exchange and a final call requesting to speak to a supervisor. I can only imagine how many people they make money off of who either don't check their invoices or don't bother calling back for a refund...We only chose Budget because they allow a spouse to drive for free with no extra charge. But at this point the extra hassle and time spent on this rental was not worth the savings."
"BE VERY AWARE OF THIS BUDGET CAR HIRE ADDITIONAL COST.If you hire a car from budget from a premium location like and airport and you have an accident, Budget will add a 15% location charge to the cost of the accident and this will not be covered by any third party excess insurance. This is not in the Key Conditions of the contract agreement that you sign when you hire the car but is on their extensive General Conditions which is on the Web.DO NOT FALL FOR THIS!!! BE AWARE!!!"
I rented from Budget because of no extra charge for spouse. I was in Aruba. They said they don't give free spouse add-on drivers in Aruba. I was stuck. So took it but I'm done with BUDGET!
"Budget Rental cars is not upfront with their fees. The car I rented recently in San Diego for $353 ended up costing me $660. They added on fees for - daily facility fee, car licensing recoup and my favorite..an untitled extra 11% fee on top of even the sales tax fee. There are a lot of other companies that people can use - I won't rent from Budget again. I rent about five cars a year and these guys don't need any more of my money."
Bradley......all those fees are included in the intial booking reservation price. If you booked thru the Budget website you were aware of those fees when you booked. Every rental car company charges these mandatory fees.
I had a similar experience with Budget. They told me my upgrade fee was $0.06 and then ended up charging my credit card an additional $47! I submitted copies of my rental agreement to the national customer service number and they still refused to refund my money. They are definitely crooks who tack on charges that the customer did NOT agree to and are dishonest in their practices.
If by rental agreement you mean the adjusted one to include a $.06 upgrade and there is a total for all the charges shown and you returned the car on time then you should simply provide that information to your credit card company and dispute the charge.More often than not customers don't seem to get a copy of the new agreement when they agree to changes and then have no proof of what they actually agreed to.
"I have been hiring cars in the USA for over 20 years and have NEVER been treated as dishonestly as I have been with a recent trip to Ohio where I was unlucky enough to choose Budget Car Rental @ Cleveland Airport. I booked and pre-paid for an SUV (in case of snow) through expedia, which was more than adequate for myself and my colleague. We arrived into Cleveland at around 11.00pm, one of the last flights in, which I assume was one of the reasons why the Budget representative thought their CON would work. I was told that ""As I had booked Online I was getting a free upgrade""... No mention of any charges at all. When the rental agreement was printed, I questioned why there was a charge, I was told in no uncertain terms that this was covered as part of the pre-payment I had already made and didn't need to worry about it, I wouldn't be charged. It was late, I signed the rental agreement - BIG MISTAKE.... On return to the UK and additional $154.60 was charged to my Credit card, when i tried to sort it out I was abruptly informed by Troy @ budget that Avis/Budget do not offer free upgrades, I must have been confused as I had signed the agreement, He then went on to say ""However, Avis will be upholding the charges that were signed for. This will be our final decision on this rental"" -- END OF STORY...My colleague travelling with me had the exact recollection of the conversations with the representative.... SO be VERY CAREFUL when being offered a FREE UPGRADE, they DO NOT exist !!!!!!! Thanks Troy for your dreadful customer service and Thank you to the young lady with the Grey eyes on the counter for the most elaborate CON.....DO NOT BOOK WITH BUDGET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I rented a car from Budget for Cancun from 3/6/19-3/16/19. I decided to buy the Allianz insurance at the same time, for $99. When I got to the Budget site in Cancun, I was advised that the insurance I bought was not enough and that I must purchase their insurance for $350.00, or they wouldn't give me a car. My wife and I decided to do as told and that we would take it up with Budget when we got home. i have been emailing and speaking by phone with Budget customer service and they don't seem to care that their Cancun store lied to us and thus cheated us out of $350. Beware of Budget in Cancun!"
"That's one of the biggest problems with Budget, that their customer support is complicit in these deceitful practices (which are not limited to Cancun or Cleveland). The normal expectation that the best course is to accept anything to get away from a dishonest agent and to rely on customer service to clear it up doesn't work with Budget. Some may not agree, but staying well clear of them sure seems like good advice."
"Agreed. And since they are part of the Avis group, I'll stay away from Avis as well."

I think if you slow down and sound out the words you'll realize it says the opposite.If you re-read the recent posts the same way you might better appreciate the dilemma faced by the posters when facing dishonest agents. What is shocking is the consistency of the techniques used for fraud across so many locations - as if they've been trained or coached.
"Is there anyone there who can help with your reading? The post says ""doesn't work with Budget"". The ""cause of hundreds of complaints"" is Budget's agents engaging in deliberate fraud."

"My posts recommend staying away from Budget completely because of these practices, that it's deliberate fraud and not a mistake by an incompetent agent that Budget will fix.It's naive to be so adamant, actions depend on the scope of the fraud. Some will value their own and their companions comfort and time more than the extra fees. Or the amount is less than walking away from the deposit. Or when there's a verbal assurance that it's a free upgrade refunded later or that it's a mandatory fee not in the original quote (as in fraud). Posts here shine a light on these tactics, and suggest steering clear of Budget for condoning them.You have yet to condemn Budget for these practices smushie, yet you often blame customers for falling for them. Why, what is your stake in all of this?"

"You've already tried this, you're still confusing the word ""expectation"" with ""advice"". It does seem very important to you to find flaws in criticisms of Budget and their agents. You can relax - there's clearly something personal at stake here and trying to deflect doesn't hide it. My question was rhetorical"
"Actually the best advice I can give, which will never be read by ranting posters here - is to search the forums thoroughly as part of one’s own research BEFORE booking. But, as noted, TA members don’t do that. A good second bit of advice is to research car insurance needs in a forum country. Fact is that Mexico has different requirements than the US. So, renting from ANY agency in Mexico could be reported as a scam by 789/791. And yes, I have rented before in Cancun. https:/…Then I agree to never sign anything not thoroughly read. But, all this fails if people don’t do any research beforehand and just one or two post rant. Fine by me, but you really aren’t warning anyone...just getting it off your chest."
Hard to be sure how many people your tips help - anyone who reads them first usually won't need to rant :).At least each rant gets this thread higher up in google search which might help a broader audience.
"tres mecontent d une reservation a l agence budget de naples ,ou l on a pas pu retirer une voiture reservee ,car le permis du conducteur etait un peu abime dans son portefeuilleon a reserve chez Europcar le lendemain ,sans probleme"
"Same happened to me in Key West. SCAM. They told me to send my receipt. I dont think I was given one, and who keeps them anyway?? Unbelievable."
"Yeah, who keeps receipts, and why would you ever need one?"
"12500 posts, that's quite an investment of time and effort. Consider what could have been accomplished had that razor wit had been aimed at the criminals in the travel business rather than the victims."
"Re: 805... At least all those posts are not singularly focused on one topic and thread like you.... But, seriously, Budget Car Rental = criminals.... maybe you should consider reading other posts here."
"I have consistently given advice to read the contract before you sign it. I agree that the tactics agents often use are deceitful. Budget seems bad, but they aren't the only car rental company that does this. If someone heeds the advice to avoid Budget, but rents from another company and blindly drives off without reading the contract the same issue could happen.And to the statement who keeps receipts picture me slapping the palm of my hand against my forehead. I can't respond to that statement any other way."
"Not keeping gas receipts is common enough that the pumps ask if you want it printed. Budget doesn't need a copy of their own receipt, it's online.Making a victim feel at fault for falling for the fuel scam only helps Budget customer service. The OP has already learned Budget insists on a receipt with this scam so you're not helping her. Perhaps a fraction of the time spent here could be used to lobby TA, the BBB, government, or law enforcement to crack down on the industry."
"I was responding to post # 803. I see nothing about a gas receipt. The poster stated ""Same happened to me in Key West"". Same what? There are over 800 posts, so I'm not sure what ""same thing"" happened to poster #803.But assuming it is a gas receipt, how else can you prove you filled the tank before returning the car if you don't have a receipt?You can leave yourself wide open to getting cheated then play the victim or you can do everything in your power to prevent being cheated in the first place. That is the point of my post # 807. I'm sure there are posts from people who took prudent steps and still got cheated, but many on this forum simply did not take the time to review the charges (or even get a receipt at check in) before driving off.If you leave a wad of cash sitting in plain view on the dashboard of your car and you walk away with the window rolled down the cash may not be there when you get back. Maybe it's time to ask if there is something you could have done differently to protect yourself?"
"It's not difficult to deduce she meant the gas receipt, there's only that and the rental receipt. Budget checks the fuel gauge on return, proof of fuel purchase is only required if they run the fuel scam or the the pre-paid fuel option contract padding scam.Of course your advice is sound, there's never been any disagreement. Offering it to people who have learned the hard way is closing the barn door afterwards, and the sarcasm only helps Budget. Might be more effective to proactively help folks who aren't aware of TA or the common car rental scams."
Everyone is offered a receipt at return of the car. Fuel level is noted on the receipt at that time. What's the problem?
"And how exactly do you propose I reach out to people who are not on TA to expose this grave injustice? I really don't have any interest in being an advocate for people who don't read contracts or keep receipts.In post #808 you propose ""Perhaps a fraction of the time spent here could be used to lobby TA, the BBB, government, or law enforcement to crack down on the industry."" If you are interested I suggest you get right on it. Although TA does not have a consumer protection department so I'm not sure what they can do. You can file a complaint with the BBB, but those who don't bother to read reviews aren't going to see those complaints either and I suspect there are already complaints there.One more thing you can do is google Budget car rental class action suits. There have been many, but none of them are going to put them out of business. And even if Budget goes out of business the practices will continue under other names.The only thing that will stop deceptive practices is consumers who are aware and that's not likely to happen."
"With zero effort you could do no harm. If customers aren't told it's their own fault (it's not, they're the victims, not the offenders) more may complain publicly. Or advise them on how best to get the problem resolved in their favor. Of course along with warning/advising them here - we don't know how many avoid it by reading TA. The more people that fight back publicly and win the less lucrative the scams. If the complaints are public enough we might even see an agency champion honest practices and lift the entire industry (as marketing of course but it'd still help)."
"My wife and I recently returned from a trip to Charlotte N.C. We rented a full size car from Budget, and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The problem was when i got to the car i found that it was left extremely dirty, especially on the outside. All of the windows and mirrors were so dirty i couldn't hardly see through them. The 1st night i was there i went to my daughters house and borrowed their Windex to clean the windows and mirrors. I have rented cars many times in the past and this was the 1st time i have ever seen one that looked like it may have had a water hose run over it at the most. (hopefully this was just a one time thing and not indicative of the way Budget does business.)"
"I was verbally assaulted by an Avis/Budget car return attendant. On 5/19/19 at budget nearest to St. Louis lambert airport. I wa called a “ stupid fu###ng bit##!”. This young lady was rude and her ignorance/laziness almost resulted in my missing my flight. If I were on the board or a stockholder in this corporation, I most certainly would NOT my interests represented by such a business-illiterate associate with a chop on her shoulder."
"Lol. Well, that’s part of the story...."

"We rented a car from Budget Antigua Guatemala. Stuff was very unprofessional, but the worst thing is they took 990 EUR deposit and after more than two weeks waiting we still have no money back.Is it possible they just steal this sum ?"
"On May 24 and 10:30 AM we arrived at Vancouver International to pickup a rental car from Budget. This rental was a confirmed reservation made using Air Canada Avion points. Our issue is with the airport counter staff. A group of pretentious and unfriendly people. Waiting in the ""line"", reservation was found, we did all the paperwork, and were told to ""wait"". No idea why. After 30 minutes I went back in line, and asked where my car was. It was obvious the nothing was happening with our reservation. The clerk would not offer an explanation or answer direct questions because we were ""not special"". Our situation was not unique as serveral others were also ""waiting"", while others were just given cars. It is obvious that Budget is playing some sort of service game with discounted reservations. If Budget does not want our business, there are other companies."
"@Dangis K, if you used a credit card it was likely a hold rather than a charge and should have been released - you can contact your credit card company for help in any case.If you used a debit card you may need to complain to budget customer service, and as loudly as you can on their public feeds like facebook. Good luck!"
"Budget became horribleFirst, local phone numbers do not work. We wanted to ask for directions, because we could not find it at the noted address and first surprise was waiting for us, the number had extensions to connect us to global customer service or to global rental, but not to local office, so there was nobody, who could give us directions.Second, at the location the line consisted of just one person, but it took the staff good half an hour to serve him. The staff was similar to their telephone service, an-answering-machine-man. He did not accept a debit card connected to my bank account or CASH. He informed me he needs a credit card to run a credit check. Credit check? Really? I do not use credit cards, I like to operate with finances I have and keep them under control. To add I was renting a car for a week, not for a day or a couple of hours.I was shocked and will not use BUDGET anytime in close future. Just imagine, American money are not good enough for them to pay for a car in USI think they went too far in their thrifting experience, no real people to talk to, no problems solved, a bunch of hidden crazy rules. They lost my business"
Good luck using cash at any rental car company.You realize if a rental car company takes a debit card they will require a substantial hold on the account until the car is returned. That's why most people rent with credit cards and if there is a dispute about additional charges they have your money from your debit card. If you use a credit card you can file a dispute before paying it.It's not a new thing to have a hard time getting a local office number for rental car companies. The few times I've wanted to do that it's been difficult and when I have gotten a local number no one picks up anyway because they are busy helping customers.Edited: 1 year ago 
"** Warning to other people! I had a wreck with a deer in New York near Niagara Falls. I had to have my car towed to the hotel and 2 days later I had to rent a car to continue our trip. I normally rent from Enterprise but they did not have any cars until the next day and we needed to check out of the hotel to be on our way for our trip. Budget had a car so we decided to rent from budget. Renting from Budget was quick (with paperwork). I wanted to use my Visa debit card but they did not want that. My Mom had to use her credit card. They charged us $435 for a week which was average for the other companies. My car was supposed to be done in a week so I said I would return the rental in New York in a week. Later, I found out that it was going to take 2 weeks so we had to return home instead and rent one more day to get home. They charged me $383 for a day and to return it at home! The lady on the phone said to call customer service to see if they would wave the $250 fee for changing the return location. I asked but they would not do it. The man said to ask after it was returned and to get a groupon code to apply at the return office. I did and the lady said they were locally owned so they could not do anything with the coupon. They said they needed to close the rental and I had to call customer service. They would not do anything because it was closed. I wanted to let people know what this company does. I have rented from Enterprise many times and never had this kind of thing happen plus they pick you up and drop you off!"
"What is your complaint, Teresa? Is it that they charge a drop fee when you changed return date and the drop location? If so, I'd bet every company would have done the same. You can't rent a car and just return it anywhere."
"It might have been the nonsense of suggesting a groupon coupon, or the BS about being ""wholly owned"" and not honoring it.Or it might be the game that Budget customer service plays - call them as soon as you find a problem they say they can't do anything while the rental is open. When you call them back after they say it's too late because the rental is already closed."
None of that would have mattered had the car been returned to the correct and agreed upon location.
"""I have rented from Enterprise many times and never had this kind of thing""Are you saying you have changed drop off locations and Enterprise didn't charge you extra? I did a dummy booking on Enterprise website picking up a car in Niagara Falls and dropping in Independence, MO. The drop fee would be $389."
You both think it's the fee rather the poor customer service that's the issue? What about earlier when the budget employee used foul language toward a customer - do you believe more of the story was necessary because in some circumstances it's ok for them to act like that?Certainly there's an extra charge when the drop off is at a different location. But we definitely have different views on what constitutes a basic level of customer service and training.
"I guess unless Teresa comes back to clarify we won't know for sure. I understood her issue to be the extra charges. I'm not trying to justify poor customer service from anyone, but if she expected not to be charged for the change in return date and location I don't think that's practical."
"Arranged via BA to hire a car at Bari Airport and drop off back there 10 days later.We arrived at the airport on the 3rd of June at around 11.00 only to be confronted by a long queue at the Budget /Avis counter. The queue hardly moved for the next 45 minutes and in the end it took an hour and a quarter for us to be allocated a car. We walked to the car pickup area only to be told that our car was being washed. This took another 25 minutes.Budget can say this was a one-off as their systems were down but talking to someone at Bari airport who came out on a different day, it took them an hour and three quarters to get their car too. Before we get to the desk Budget know our full names, postal address, mobile, email DOB, the sort of car we want, so surely most of the work is doneCome on guys sort it out"
"It had been a while since I had rented a car but me and my husband were flying into Florida from Nashville and needed a rental. I had never used Budget, I had always used Enterprise but thought I would try Budget as I'm a Rapid Rewards member and the rates were good. Or so I thought. We picked up the car in Florida where I was shocked that they now just have the keys in the car. No attendant to look over any existing damage or anything. Whatever, we took the car anyway. The agreement was to return it to Nashville BNA of which we did, but we were about an hour late returning it because of traffic and construction work through Georgia. When we got to the garage the attendant for Budget was already gone for the day. So after wondering around for about 10 minutes we located an Avis rep. She said that the Budget rep is normally gone at this time but when we asked how to pay, we were told they would just charge the card on file. We were like, ugh no because we want to know what's being charged and we wanted to use our debit card and not our credit card. Looking back I'm sure they would have preferred we just leave the car and let them charge whatever they wanted. The Avis attendant checked us out and informed us of a $21.99 late charge fee because we were an hour late and on top of that they had the nerve to put taxes on the freakin late fee!!! Never again Budget, you probably need to change your name because you and all your fees are anything but ""Budget"" friendly. Enterprise next time. Stick with what you know."
"YROBERTS44: So, here's the thing. I honestly don't care if you rent from Budget or not. But, when you booked, you agreed to their Terms and Conditions. And right they are...>>Do late-return fees apply?Vehicles are rented on a daily (24-hour) basis. There is a 29-minute grace period for returns. After 30 minutes late, hourly car rate charges and taxes may apply. After 90 minutes late, full-day late charges and taxes may apply.... <<So, you were given good information and no one attempted to defraud you. Further, you should have done better research on traffic, because that's on you. And finally, please use Enterprise in the future and then please come back to complain when they do the exact same thing - because their grace period is identical.https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/post…https:/…late-returns-policy.html"
"Bk_t1 or whatever your name is, I never said they attempted to defraud me. And if you drive anywhere in the United States, it does not matter how much ""RESEARCH"" you do on traffic if there's a wreck, oil spill or whatever, these things can't be predicted, so it's not on me.Yes I'm sure late fees apply everywhere and I'm sure Enterprise has them as well, they just know how to handle their customers. It's called CUSTOMER SERVICE, which I really hope is not your profession."
"YROBERTS44: Angry much? Here’s what you typed previously.>>The agreement was to return it to Nashville BNA of which we did, but we were about an hour late returning it because of traffic and construction work through Georgia. <<You didn’t cite something catastrophic or an oil spill or whatever you insinuated in #833. You cited traffic and road construction, which can absolutely be planned for. Then you cited late fees and taxes, both of which are listed in their terms. I’m sorry you want to somehow attack me for somehow offering bad customer service in my profession - but I’m just reading what you wrote and responding - which is 100% allowed in the forums. Hope the next person who serves you, does better and cheers you up. Have a good day."
"I'm missing the point of the customer service complaint in post 831 as well.Is it that the office didn't stay open late for your pleasure?That it ""can't be predicted, so it's not on me""? You still have their car, why would it be on them?Taxes have nothing to do with the reason of the fee.Switching to debit won't stop Budget from applying any additional charges determined even after the rental closes (as per the rental agreement). It's actually a little better to use credit because the CC company will help with any dispute, and you can always pay it off immediately."
"The car rented did not have functioning cruise control. We attempted to replace the car by contacting the Budget Rental center near our destination in Gwinn, Michigan (at Sawyer Intl Airport) on 3 different occasions on Saturday and Sunday, including leaving a voicemail that was never returned. After contacting the corporate help center, it was recommended that we simply visit the Gwinn location. When we arrived, the Budget employee, Daphne, was immediately disrespectful and very briskly informed us that she had no cars available for us to use (with no explanation as to why almost all 14 Budget parking spots were filled). When we attempted to ask for a recommendation for any alternative method, she instead answered the phone and began ignoring us. After finishing her phone call, she went outside without another word, leaving us stunned. When she returned, she expressed surprise and frustration that we were still there and then told us we should have called ahead to see if we could switch out the vehicle. When we told her that was what we did and it was the corporate office who told us to just come by, she said (verbatim) ""Well, this isn't corporate. They have no idea what's going on here."" Then she said we should've left a message. When we told her we did, she proceeded to tell us that we did not. However, in an attempt to prove us wrong, she began to check the voice mailbox and discovered there was one saved message, likely ours from 24 hours before. We never found out if that message was ours though because she then began ignoring us again and talked through us to help the customer behind us (who also seemed angered by the service). It was then that we left because it was clear we were not going to receive any help or apologies for her behavior. Daphne was incredibly rude, disrespectful, and embarrassing to a paying customer that her employer had (inadvertently) inconvenienced. There is no excuse for Daphne's behavior and she has soured more Budget rentals for us.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I recently rented a car from Budget at Catania Airport, Sicily. Be careful when hiring cars from Budget. They are cheap but they don't include all the damage on the damage reports and then do a very thorough inspection when you drop off and charge you for every scratch more than 3 cm. I think this is company policy to increase margins. I paid 250 euros for minor damage I didn't do that wasn't on the damage report. This is below the insurance excess so even if you take out their insurance, you still have to pay for damage up to the 500 euros excess. Also, I left my SatNav in the car and despite persistent attempts to contact Budget about its return, we could get hold of no one in Budget who could offer any assistance. A very poor experience from very poor company. Mark (Bristol, United Kingdom)"
"Dreadful, do not use!!!!!!!!!! I prepaid £140 with Auto Europe for the total hire in Italy, passed over my card at the desk and was told that it was only for the deposit then I was charged £470!!! I signed the documents in Italian and was not offered them in English, at no point was I offered them in English and when I queried it on my return they just said ""well you signed them and should have asked for them in English"" At no point was I offered any any addition services, I asked them why on a £140 rental car would I pay another £470 almost 4 times the original cost and all they said was ""I couldn't say"" well I could I SIMPLY WOULDN'T!Don't think as I did when booking that you should use a big company as they are more trustworthy!!Truly shocking"
"We travelled to Italy last month and rented a car out of the Rome Airport. Be careful. Even though we went with a national brand (Avis/Budget), they tried to upcharge us for multiple items. It took almost 2 hours to get our car. After we got home I found an additional charge on our credit card for almost $900, I have had to fight it now for over 4 weeks. Be sure to check the contract very carefully and take pictures of the vehicle before and after for any damage. Once you leave the country it is tough to fight the fake charges."
You might try complaining on Budget's own social media pages - out of the glare of the public eye budget customer service tries to give you the runaround. They seem to respond more quickly and appropriately to comments/complaints left on facebook and on the BBB site.
"Bad Company, Bad cars, bad service, Be careful, Do not touch. Worst car rental company!"
"I rental car from online website of budget rental. I selected the option which said cover your vehicle damage collison waiver, third party insurance. I called up budget who confirmed that I have taken protection for car and i added road side assistance. When I arrived at Milan to pick up the vehicle from the train station. Firstly dissapointed that it took almost 2 hours for them to give me the vehicle. The wait time is just unacceptable. The Italian have no professionalism. Also to my surprise, I was told that no car has been taken for car and third party is basic included which cover's passenger and belonging only. I was shocked as I was confirmed on the website and on call that I have taken car proctection so I was shocked to find that I was mislead by website and staff of Budget. After waiting for 2 hours and trying to proof my point I had no energy and time to wait longer so paid double the price to take full car insurance with them. I could have gone with more reputable company and got better deal. I paid 904.00 pounds for 4 days hire. Ripp off . The van I was given 9 seater did not have aircon working properly and it was summer. We lost so much time of our holiday and was not bothered to come back to Budget to change. The worst company I have ever dealt with.They should not be allowed to trade . DO not trust them.PLEASE BE AWARE BOOKING WITH BUDGET> SCAMMERS"
"I have had a great customer service everywhere in the country.But I had for the third time a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE in NEWINGTON CT.The lady who pretended she was the manager, intentionally gave me a hard time. I had prepaid online a couple of weeks ago. When I arrived in her office she asked me to show her the passport in addition to the driver's license. I had to go home and come back. Then she did not want to recognize my reservation and payment. She charged me at a very higher price. I asked her to follow my reservation and she did not want to. Then I called customer service. Maybe 6 different people. Only 2 of them hung up. The rest said they see my payment and my reservation and I should take the car and leave. I begged them to contact her and tell her. They said they're not supposed to ???? After one hour conversation, I told her to go with her price and get a refund forthe previous payment. She said she already rented the car....Awfull... I did get the car in Enterprise Rent-A-Car I hope I get my money back. I wasted 2 hours. DO NOT RENT budget in NEWINGTON. You will regret..."
Absolutely agree...Budget just billed me 22$ for two tolls that did not accept cash in Florida. The rest I paid cash. The tolls from Budget should have been a total of 4$ - not $22.50
Have found the same thing in the past with Budget so now avoid them
"You choose to go thru cashless tolls- you pay later. Once you pass thru a cashless toll Budget charges $3.95 per day (everyday of the rental) or $20 per month. Plus the cost of the toll, of course. If you don’t want to pay their toll program fees- don’t use the cashless lanes.Edited: 1 year ago "
"hawkeye,Some of the toll roads in Florida are totally cashless, no way to pay.To post #845 and 846,As has been said probably 100 times on this thread all rental companies charge fees for tolls. You can avoid Budget, but you will have the same issue with every other rental car company. The better plan is to research to either avoid tolls or find the company with the lowest fees."
"I understand that. I’ve been many times. But still, it’s the drivers choice. There are warning signs about the cashless tolls and exits. They can be voided"
Thank you so much for posting this. We had one of the worst experiences ever with budget and we appreciate everyone letting people know how horrible their practices are and rental car service.
"It should be the driver's choice, but I think the problem comes in when the driver does not research, so doesn't realize they have a choice. I reread your post Hawkeye and now understand I believe you meant the driver has a choice about using the toll road or avoiding it. I first read it to mean the driver had a choice to pay or go cashless."
"Yes, I’m sorry, my post wasn’t very clear. While I very much dislike the tolls in Florida, especially Orlando.....The driver does have a choice of which roads they drive on or which exits they take. I came up behind a stopped UK resident in a rental car years ago that was terrified to drive thru as she didn’t have coins. I think the whole toll program around Orlando stinks. People visit there from all over the world. Can’t we make it a little more user friendly?But, I guess it can be easier....... Most of the car company toll packages are reasonably priced. Budget is $20 max. I use Alamo and I think theirs is $20 max too. So, add $20 to the price of your Disney vacation, use the in car toll transponder, and be done with it.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I agree there should be a better way. I'm not sure of the process, but I assume the rental companies do have some administrative expenses in tracking and paying tolls. I know they aren't going to eat the costs and you are right, in the scheme of things it's not a big chunk of a vacation budget."
"LOOKS LIKE IT""S ALL THEIR LOCATIONS .....I am writing to help others avoid the overcharge scam that I encounter through Budget rental at St. Thomas. I rented a vehicle through Costco travel membership and it was through Budget. Being a “bigger” chain rental vs a small island rental, I assumed all would be good. I was wrong. I got my vehicle at the Cyril King Airport and when picking up my vehicle she asked if I wanted the Loss Damage Waiver, to which I replied “no” she then indicated since my 23 year old son was underage I would need to sign and pay $20 a day(which I did even though he is a pilot and they rent to them without age restrictions), to which I signed the small signature device. Once we arrived at our place, I was looking at our contract and noticed we were also being charged an additional $ 34.99 per day. ($244.93). I also noticed they charged us $7.50 per day ($52.50) for the “additional driver” that Costco offers for free. I called Budge and was instructed they could not fix my issue prior to returning my vehicle and to continue my rental to term and dispute it AFTER we completed the rental. HOW CONVENIENT, because now they are indicating that the charges stand because my initials are in a box “that I signed” stating I wanted the Loss Damage Waiver. I explained that they verbally tell you what you are signing before you sign the box and that all 3 of us heard her specifically indicate that was for the underage driver. I explained that on my original rental agreement, it specifically shows I declined the Loss Damage Waiver. At this time, Budget indicated that the car rental at Cyril King Airport is independently owned and they can do as they desire. I indicated I would not have rented from Budget if they couldn’t stand behind all their agreements, as I have heard of independent franchises “scamming” tourists for their own gain. I am disheartened that Budget would offer their name to a franchise that operates business this way. I am no longer going to use Budget for any future travel but want to warn others to avoid this scam. Look at your contract PRIOR to leaving the desk and learn not to trust businesses to operate ethically. Lesson learned."
While you’re avoiding Budget know that there is not one car company that hasn’t been accused of this very common practice. Regardless of the company....Look at the contract and the total price before leaving with the car
Same old story. car wasn't there waited 2 hrs tried to charge for an upgrade tried to rob me at every turn Then when I returned car Ithey said I was 20 mins late line was a half hour. 165.25. pure rip off. they should be ashamed of themselves.
"""While you’re avoiding Budget know that there is not one car company that hasn’t been accused of this very common practice.""Perhaps, but Budget sure seems to be among the worst - 856 comments and going strong. Not to mention Budget corporate's customer service trick - claiming to be unable to help until the rental ends then refusing to help afterward because the rental has ended.For anyone with this experience - complain publicly on their facebook page or at the BBB as there appears to be a better chance of success/refund. Budget prefers it to keep it hidden and keep your money.""Regardless of the company....Look at the contract and the total price before leaving with the car""He'd already said that better than you: ""Look at your contract PRIOR to leaving the desk and learn not to trust businesses to operate ethically."". Why echo his advice?"
"""Why echo this advice?""It's been said thousands of times on TA forums. Obviously, it can't be said enough. It's simply amazing that people can be charged for something they don't want, or need, and have no clue until sometime later. LOOK AT THE PRICE BEFORE LEAVING WITH THE CAR"
They should be ashamed of themselves
"You've confused ""echo"" with ""repeat"". Repetition is good, simple minded echos dilute the complaints.What's ""amazing"" is not acknowledging the budget agent's deliberate (perhaps even encouraged) slight of hand. It's not amazing at all that it works - the agents practice many, many times per day for use on customers who are seldom in front of that desk. I agree, they should be ashamed.Not all budget users are TA members and not all read your posts. It'd be more effective to post a negative review on google for that branch where it will pre-warn folks finding directions to pick up the rental. As well as complaints to the BBB and FB to encourage them to seek compensation."
"Rarely are they due any compensation. Finding a company charged you for insurance after returning the car is too late. It’s difficult to dispute a charge you signed for. I know companies do this. They have been doing it for years. The consumer has 100% in control of this. Just spend 3 seconds looking at the total price of the contract. Just a quick glance is all it takes. If everyone would look at the price on the rental contract and speak up if it’s wrong we could stop this practice. But, that’s probably not going to happen. So, there will be many more sign for the insurance they don’t need. See you here again."
"""Rarely are they due any compensation.""They are ALWAYS due compensation. Fraudulent misrepresentation of a contract by an agent of Budget IS grounds to rescind and to claim damages. The problem is, as you say, the difficulty of getting compensation given Budget's policies intended to misdirect and to discourage complaints. It is better to refuse a contract vs pursuing damages. But it's best to completely avoid agents and companies like Budget that actively engage in fraud.If we encourage people to complain and bring the practice to light perhaps it won't be so widespread or profitable for Budget. Discouraging customers by saying ""too late, you signed"" is helping the criminals. And incorrect."
Fine. But remember this....... look at the price you’re being charged!
"I recently flew from Perth Western Australia to San Francisco and went to pick up our pre paid budget rent a car. The agent told me our selected car was unsuitable for our trip and we needed a 4wd. We asked how much to upgrade and were told about US $300 and with fees we already knew of the bill would be US $400. He asked about insurance upgrade and we said our travel insurance covered it. When he placed a difficult to read print out it had a total of over US $700 we said no way but were told “ Don’t worry the money you already paid comes off this amount. When we were charged the $700 we contacted budget and they can’t or won’t explain the total bill but it seems we purchased 3 different insurances, paid in full for an extra driver for a second time. Oh and they have just kept the original money paid as this was a complete new car hire. Oh and the 4wd was completely unnecessary and wasn’t selected at anytime. I will never use budget again."
"""Fine. But remember this....... look at the price you’re being charged!""Yes, of course. But it comes across as tone deaf to imply it's simple when surrounded by so many posts where victims check, complain, the agent lies again. These agents practice their craft every day, it's difficult for an infrequent customer be prepared for all of their tactics."
I wish I had read this post before renting with Budget. I picked up a Premium car 36 minutes before my due pick up time. I asked if I could drop it back the next day without any extra charge for the extra 36 minutes and was told it would not be a problem. Now I have been charged an extra $140 for an extra 35 minutes of rental. Do not trust this company as they will lie and say anything to take your money. Never again will I make the mistake of renting with Budget and Avis.
We will never ever ever rent from Budget Rent A Car. Rude staff and dirty cars.
"I had a recent experience similar to above.I agreed to pay the tolls ,plus an administrative charge. The total tolls were 11.00. The admin fee was 17.00 for two uses of the tollroad over three days .I think admin of over 100% of the bill is a bit excessive.Edited: 7:51 pm, September 18, 2019 "
>>I think admin of over 100% of the bill is a bit excessive.<<Then do better research in advance of booking. All rental agencies have off-loaded toll charges to two main billing services. And those services pass along exorbitant fees for administration and processing.
"Yeah, percentage has nothing to do with it, it's a flat rate fee."
"Denver Colorado September 7 2019 Was told our jeep was in B2. That spot contained a huge chevy. A man with budget stopped with a CRV and tried to force me to take the CRV, which was not the car or license plate I rented. He obviously did not understand English or their system. Finally another employee helped us find the correct vehicle, parked in A2. Be careful when renting from budget. Very scary. Return was fine at Phoenix."
"I rented a car at the Denver Airport at the end of May for one week. The car had not been cleaned and had trash still inside. There was a crack in the windshield and various scratches and dents on the exterior. I took pictures but was not able to find someone to speak to without going back inside and waiting in line, so I took the car and went on my way. When I dropped it off I was an hour and half late due to my plane flight back. When I got my charge, Budget charges another full day of rental for the car. I call and complained and they took $27 off a $60 charge. Now 3 and half months later, I noticed a $187 charge on my credit card from Budget with no explanation. I thought that someone had stolen my credit card number, so I called Budget and ask what the charge was for. To my disbelief, the man said that it was for a broken window which was already cracked when I picked the car up. I told the man that and that I had taken pictures of all the damage when I picked up the car because I could not believe how bad of shape the vehicle was in. Luckily the picture of the windshield was still on my phone. The man asks me to email it to the company and they would investigate. I will never use Budget again or Avis since they are both owned by the same holding company."
"Very upset at the way we were treated in Las Vegas when we picked up a rental car for our vacation. Agent was astonishingly rude, gave us a terrible vehicle with a bad smell and poor brakes, and when we went back inside and questioned it, that same agent told us it was that or nothing. We requested some sort of compensation and it was embarrassingly little, considering the stress we went through using this vehicle for three weeks. Budget is a terrible company. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! Anyone else is better. Sad to have to write this."
"Iceland Car RentalWe were treated nicely by the staff in all contact, and even offered a free car ride to Reykjavik centre after dropping off the car. HOWEVERBefore the start of the trip (Mid-Oct) I emailed Iceland Budget to ask if they offer winter tyres and studded winter tyres. They said that I have to ask at the desk when collecting the car about winter tyres. Regarding studded winter tyres I was told they are illegal to use before November, When collecting the car I asked for winter tyres and was told that the car I was given had winter tyres. All good. However while driving around the country we came across several Budget cars and local cars with studded winter tyres. Why was I lied to? Also while driving in the snow in the mountains we came across other 4x4 cars not using winter tyres. So I'm assuming that Budget do not ask the car renter if they will need winter tyres. So makes sure you ask for them. When collecting the car, no Budget agent comes with you to the car in Reykjavik airport. We were given a paper with dents on the car and were told to send photos of other dents we find that are not shown on the paper. We found several, and even big ones. So make sure you check the car properly before leaving the airport."
"I have been renting from Budget for a long time, via Costco. I always return my car with a full tank. This time I saw on my receipt a charge for about $6.00 for gas. The receipt indicated that the tank had 13.5 gallons of gas when I picked it up and 12.9 gallons when I returned it. It turns out that the fuell tank capacity of the Jeep Compass is 13.5 gallons. I am cynical enough to believe that Budget just claims that the tank was completely full. My belief was reinforced when I noticed that the gas gauge had dropped significantly after I had driven the car just 20 miles. I also take exception to being charged $9.99/gallon! I find it very hard to believe that Budget is going to add an additional 1/2 gallon of gas to the car. I am also pissed that I was not informed that Budget is now operating in such a flagrant, money-grabbing way. Disgusting. What increments is Budget going to charge for fuel discrepancies—1/4 gallon increments? 1/10 gallon increments? How about by the ounce? Do I need to carry a gas can with me with a couple of ounces of fuel so I don’t get nickel-and-dimed by Budget?"

"Why was the car ""seized""? It sounds like a problem with your credit card? Why didn't you just return the car yourself? And, why would you keep $5000 worth of goods in a car?"
Your car insurance or travel insurance will cover theft. Have you claimed?

Why was the car seized? Did you do something illegal or just couldn’t or didn’t pay for the car? I’ve rented a car hundreds of times and not once have the police seized the car. Details will help others avoid the same problem.

So the car was taken back because whoever gave it to you didn’t pay or return it. Got it. Thanks
Needless to say getting your possessions back from a vehicle you did not rent would probably be a bit difficult. I still don't understand or care why this issue is only coming up 3 years after the fact.
"Sorry for my English, but I used google translate. I don't wanna waste my time for this ""company"" anymore.We were charged additional fees in the amount of 72.26 euros ""for additional products"", which is an additional two car insurance, which we did not need, because we bought from an agent and for ""automatic toll charge"", i.e. a device that facilitates the process of driving on highways.We have given the lady issuing the car to us that we do not need additional insurance, as we have already bought and toll charge devices, because we will not move on the highway (Porto pickup place). Unfortunately, despite the above elements of the service have been added to the offer without our knowledge, I would like to emphasize that in a hurry, you will not always catch everything on the contract, all the more so when the employee ensures that it is part of the returnable deposit etc.I would forget, the employee literally hit us with ""automatic toll charge"", explaining that traveling in Portugal only on unpaid roads is impossible - of course this was not true, because it is. On the other hand, about adding two insurance to the offer, despite the categorical refusal and explanation that we already have the full package, is simply behavior below any criticism and good taste.The service in Lisbon left a completely different picture, which was very surprised when we explained the situation to them and only then we were explained the components of the final price.We paid about PLN 300 more, of course, the amount is not a fortune, which makes me wonder if it is worth deceiving people for such money and losing a client (perhaps also future ones) disgusted with the service of the rental company.I do not recommend (booking 855320174)."
I rented from Ben Gurion Airport Tel Aviv. It took us 30 minutes just to speak to a Budget agent and the queues were not long just very slow. On the return we had to cajole Budget to get us from the drop off to the airport at the risk of my cousin missing his flight. There were three Budget people hanging around chatting and smoking completely ignoring their customers. This is jot the service we paid for. Result: Budget is not now a first choice whatever their prices
They did the same crap to me. They confirmed that I prepaid $277.00 and it showed up on my credit card bill. came home and saw my next credit card bill it showed another $277.00. Bunch of crooks. This should investigated!
"What is happening to Budget? Every rental comes with a new string of challenges. Latest rental from BWI on 25-26 Oct. Fasttrack was down for second consecutive rental at BWI. Long line (22 min.wait). Even though I elected to and did bring the car back full they charged the fuel fees. A week or so later got a $15 charge for eToll that was In error. Not me and not the car I rented. These extra erroneous charges required significant time to get the charges reversed. For example I was asked to send documentation to prove I could not have passed thru a toll gate 200 miles from BWI when my total mileage for the rental was 68 miles. Lots of hassle and extra work renting from Budget these days. I’m gonna try another company next time. I wonder, without any proof, if these are not really mistakes but somehow revenue generating trickery."
"My name is Sara Camps, I am writing this to share with everybody and ask people NEVER RENT IN BUDGET RENTAL CAR, the worse customer service ever and biggest fraud. On October 2019, I made a car rental at the Budget Rental Car company, in Los Angeles, California, for just one day. Rented on the morning of that day and returned that same day in the afternoon.The amount charged for the rental of the car was a total of: USD 163.67.On the other hand, I was charged that same day for $200, as a deposit for the car. This amount was to be returned with a maximum of 10 business days, but they have not yet been returned to me.I've called the company Budget 10 times, to the Customer service: 1 (800) 214-6094, NEVER HELPFUL AT ALL. After a month insisting, they told me the following: ""In order to make the return of your 200 dollars, we need the fax number of your banking company"". After having spoken with my manager of my bank and having called the company Budget 10 times more, the following happened: I provided them with the email address and told me that they would put themselves in contact with my bank to return me MY $ 200; guess what: NEVER HAPPENED.Already one month and 3 days and waiting muy money to come back. Unpresentable, disrespectful and a full-blown robbery !!!!!!!!"
"Made a reservation online and paid for a week rental in advance at Budget in Weston Florida. I realized I jumped the gun on this and went to cancel barely 5 minutes later online. Talked to a ""Roberto"" in their online chat room who insisted that I had to pay a $50 cancellation fee and refused to refund my entire purchase that was just done barely minutes earlier. Online chat was completely uncooperative and I was stuck for $50. Even my partial refund was going to take 3-10 days according to Budget. The very next day I rented a car for a week instead with Enterprise just down the street from Budget, on Weston Road, in the Rick Case Honda Dealership. I called first to make sure there was no cancellation fee and there wasn't. The people at Enterprise were professional and pleasant on the phone - the complete opposite of Budget rent a car. The best part it was $45 cheaper for the week for the same economy car. I would steer far away from Budget rent A car. There are better and cheaper choices from companies with no greed that will not charge you $50 just for cancelling a reservation. I have nothing good to say about my online Budget rent a car experience. In 2019 where more and more companies are focusing on customer service in an ever changing competitive market it is hard to believe that this company is still actively practicing the obsolete policy of taking a person's money just for cancelling a reservation and in this case 5 minutes after it was made."
"APPALLING. Complete thieves!! They slipped hidden charges into our rental agreement and refuse to refund the money. I would NEVER, EVER rent a car with these people anywhere in the world. How can people act so badly in this day and age?"
">>I realized I jumped the gun on this and went to cancel barely 5 minutes later online. Talked to a ""Roberto"" in their online chat room who insisted that I had to pay a $50 cancellation fee<<Two questions:Why did you make a reservation & then try to cancel it five minutes later? Sounds like bad planning to me!Why is your failure to read the terms & conditions of that booking Budget's fault?"
"Well, he's just one person that perhaps made a simple mistake. Better questions might be:1) Why does budget constantly defraud customers by padding contracts with extra unrequested (and often verbally declined) extras?2) Why is budget's IT system so poorly designed that they need to charge $50 for cancelling a reservation before any effort has been spent preparing a vehicle? The answer is probably related to why their counter services is always so intolerably slow.For anyone that's been defrauded or misled by budget, try complaining on their social media pages or to the BBB. Their customer support team will try to deflect you personally but will often help properly if a complaint is made publicly."
">>2) Why is budget's IT system so poorly designed that they need to charge $50 for cancelling a reservation before any effort has been spent preparing a vehicle?<<The design of their IT system has nothing whatsoever to do with their policy on cancellation charges. The system will be set up to implement company policy, not dictate it."
"I agree, it is more likely due to business policies. That their policy puts $50 ahead of customer goodwill is not surprising given they appear to condone their agents engaging in fraud."
"Another warning about Budget. We rented a car in Orlando on November 14. There was damage on the car when we picked it up. The damage was noted on an official form which we received a copy of. A month later we were billed $483 for the pre-existing damage. Fortunately we had kept a copy of the form. (When we called them, they had no record of the pre-existing damage form). Now we are faced with a few hours of fighting this charge and will hopefully be successful"

"Nightmare experience. I found that as soon as I posted my problem on their social media, Facebook (I'm sure Twitter would work as well) and messaged them I was contacted and refunded the money I was owed."
"I made a reservation online With Budget and then immediately cancelled it. They charged me $75.00! The page I made the reservation on said “A reservation is not a contract.” So we did not have a contract, but they charged me $75.00? They said it it their policy- if it is my policy that I charge companies who make unauthorized Charges to my account a$300 fee would that mean they own me $300? No but that is exactly what they do. Do not involve yourself with this shady company."
"Katy, did you book a prepaid or non-refundable reservation?"
"That's bs. Don't use Budget! Enterprise has reasonable policy:""If the vehicle is returned within 2 ½ hours of the time it was rented on a subsequent day, additional hourly charges will apply"""
"MRBILL4222, what are you referring to?"
"MRBILL4222: I am also struggling to understand the point of your post. BTW, you missed part of the policy - the part which says there is only a 29 minute grace period. This is 100% consistent with almost all the majors. Here’s the link. https:/…late-returns-policy.htmlAnd a blog article which shows all the major competitors. https:/…"
">>I made a reservation online With Budget and then immediately cancelled it. They charged me $75.00! <<Did you read the Terms & Conditions which you agreed to when you made the reservation? No, thought not."
"I rented a truck to drive all of my belongings from Florida to Massachusetts. About half way into the first day of driving, it began to rain. It was not only raining outside, but inside of the truck too. The entire time it rained, I had water dripping down my back. This continued for six hours straight. By the time we reached Virginia and stopped for a break, the entire back of my shirt was soaked and so was half of my butt. When i called to complain about this to Budget, they offered to give me $40.00 back....When I asked the man on the phone how he would have felt if he got rained on for six hours, he stated that it did not matter and that it was my fault because I did not stop and wait for them to come fix it on my 24 hour drive that I was already making. This is the worst customer service I have seen in my whole life and I will never rent anything from them ever again in my life."
"I had to cancel my trip due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I canceled and received all my refunds. Budget, is charging $50 for cancellation fees. I dont understand why they are charging customers during this COVID-19 situation...unbelievable..."
"Hahannie, because they are a business, not a charity. If you had a non-refundable rate, which is what I assume because they are giving a refund, they are being generous by refunding anything."
"There are plenty of other companies in the travel industry with the foresight to forgive change and cancellation fees during this crisis - companies that care about their customers.I'd be extra, extra careful once travel returns to normal - their agents will be working even harder to mislead customers after missing out for so long."
i am appalled that during this corona virus lockdown where my hotels were closed and flights cancelledbudget car rental would not let me cancel my rental. they charged me anyhow. i WAS a customer but certainly never again
"If you booked a non-refundable prepaid rental, then you assumed the risk that if anything happened and you could not use the rental car, you lost your money. You will also need to be aware of that with any other company you use in the future."
enterprise refunded my money for my Forida trip for the same reasoncorona virus is not on me (per enterprise) after all i was ready and able to go
"exactly, Enterprise had no problem with refunding my reservation as i was ready and able to go"

"I am not so happy with the service we got.We rented a car from Bologna Airport, but the car wasn´t good.So my dad went back to the man who gave us the car and said: I got another car for you!That was a Fiat Van, but the motor says on a moment: Stop!So my dad went to call the Italian ANWB and we went to Barberino.From there we went in a taxi to Florence Airport and got another car.Now we got a Citroën Jumper.But the service isn´t good at all!So my tip is: Make sure that you choose the right persons!"
"Warning - never rent a car with Budget Car Rental.Budget car asks you to sign a blank tablet ‘for receipt of the car’.Budget posts your signature on their ‘so called’ contract.Budget car charges an insane high insurance surcharge and deducts the amount from your credit card deposit, claiming that you signed a contract including additional insurance.A clear fraudulent action, watch out !!"
"Which location is this for, Steven?I have used Budget in the past year with none of those experiences."
"As I am sure has been pointed out many times in the previous 920 comments on this post it is never advisable to sign a blank contract. I understand an unscrupulous agent may put pressure on you to do it, but DON'T. I would never, ever take off with a rental car until I have a copy of the contract including all charges."
