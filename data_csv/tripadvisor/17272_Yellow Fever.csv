Is YF still a problem? Is it a major issue in Manaus?We're traveling to Amazon in June...
From my research (note my trip isn't until next year!) I think you'll be expected to have a yellow fever certificate showing that you have had the jab upon arrival at a following country if asked for it... Sorry I can't be of more help!
"Brazil does not require YF certificate for entry, but it is highly recommended in many areas of the country, where it is an endemic disease. Manaus (and the whole Amazon) is in the recommended area.So that you know, babies born in endemic areas all get YF shots when they are 9 months old, so most of the population in these areas are covered against the disease. That is why there is no large outbreaks in that area, just a few sporadic cases (but the YF virus is present in the Amazon area); often involving people who moved there, travelers who did not get shots etc. Travelers (even from other parts of Brazil outside endemic areas) are always advised to take YF shot when going to YF endemic areas. Vaccine must be taken 10 days before travel. Always better to talk to a travel doctor before taking vaccines as there a few (very few indeed) cases when YF vaccine is not recommended:https:/â€¦index.html"
"Venezuela requires it, Brasil does not. I did not have a shot last year in May and am not planning on getting one this year either. Didn't take any malaria pills either. But I live in Mexico so perhaps i am somewhat more lackadaisical in my approach :)"

"An alarming outbreak of yellow fever that threatened Brazil early this year appears to be over, according to data released this week by the Pan American Health Organization.There were no new cases reported in Brazil in the last month, said officials of the agency, a regional branch of the World Health Organization. Of the neighboring countries to which the outbreak had spread, only Bolivia reported a case.http://nyti.ms/2v6xhQY"
This latest news is encouraging. Maybe it makes sense to wait if your trip in the Amazon is not u till late this year if the epidemic is over????
1wanaka: Wait for what? Not sure what you mean.
Sorry meant wait for YF vaccine based on most recent update....
Get the shot. It confers lifetime immunity. You never know when you'll need it regarding future travels.
