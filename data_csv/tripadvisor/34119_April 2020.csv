"Hi! Deciding on a country for next March/April/May time frame. Wifey is inclined toward going with a travel company if it's Turkey, but I am trying to allay concerns and prefer independent travel. Since we are both retired, dates are flexible. Planning to spend 3+ weeks in country. We are adventurous and I can drive anywhere in all conditions, even with the wifey yelling bloody murder. lolA few reassuring replies from you experienced independent travelers would be most appreciated, as we approach this decision making process! ;)"
"It seems we may be of a similar vintage, so I feel able to reassure you about independent travel. I’m not sure exactly what your partners concerns might be, but we’ve been visiting Turkey for over 30 years now and have travelled around quite a bit without incident (apart from the one time a wild boar gave us a nasty look). The Turkish roads are reasonable, the people very hospitable, the scenery glorious and the historical sites amazing. Oh, and the food is delicious. All you need to do is plan your route, maybe start here: https:/…25806680"
"snow66, Thanks so much for the support! We have traveled to many places but never the Middle East. I'll start researching and formulating an itinerary."
"Just out of interest, what/where is NNY state? North New York?"
"Yes...We live on 33 acres about 50 miles north of Syracuse, NY., and about 12 miles east of the Lake Ontario shoreline."
"Probably safer than your home country.With plenty research about where you want to go and what you want to see, you’ll have a great time of you visit independently rather than being herded around with a group tour."
I duly beam reassurance in the general direction of bucolic north New York. :)But do also read the general safety Top Question (and any others that strike your fancy).
Hey thanks! Messages printed and submitted to wifey. lol I love to research travel and will dig-in soon. More questions to follow in due time! Maybe one now: Anybody out there who has sea kayaked Turkey?
"Is it safe to visit Turkey in april 2020, as there is a news of corona virus spread.. my husband and I have planned everything to visit the country in April and it will be severe heartbreak for both of us if we couldn’t go!!!!So can someone please help and guide me for the same?????Edited: 3:10 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"@Kashish; Turkey has not, despite thousands of tests, curretly unearthed a SARS-CoV-2 case, though I imagine it is only a (short) matter of time.The rest is up to you."
