"Hi all. Flying out end of August. Mrs is getting a bit worried about when and where she will have to wear a mask. I have read the link that has been previously posted and as I read it face masks must be worn in airport, on public transport and in shops. As I read it there are no such restrictions on beach, around pool or when going out at night for a meal etc. Sorry if this has already been answered just trying to keep the Mrs onside."
As Yiassas says keep your eye on the changing guidelines and the thread on the top of the main Greece forum . A couple of weeks ago it was compulsory in shops but now it is advisory. In shops at one point it was 2m's social distancing but now it is 1.5m's. I have a friend on a ferry right now and he has told me that everyone is wearing masks and following the guidelines on social distancing.
p.s. we have flown (so obviously been in airports haha) with masks during the lockdown and it really was no big issue.
Got 3 very nice face masks ( with filters ) yesterday. Happy to wear them whenever necessary. I wear them for supermarket shopping and public transport here so it poses no problem at all to wear them elsewhere
Way to go Maggie :-))
"Agree very happy to wear face masks in shops etc, in fact it’s fast becoming a way of life.,,,,but to wear a face mask for 3.5 hour flight plus in the airport for another 3 + is totally different :-("
#6. Try being an ICU nurse. Youll soon get used to it. And no I am not an ICU nurse but a very good friend is.
"""I wear them for supermarket shopping and public transport here so it poses no problem at all to wear them elsewhere"" totally agree Maggie and ours was a ten hour flight. It is something we will all have to get used to for the foreseeable future as even in the UK some train and bus journeys can be longer than a flight to Crete even including time in an airport."
"#7 yes my hubby wears a mask all day every day .....agree very difficult especially in the heat, so the last thing he wants to do is wear one all day travelling too....:-(Edited: 3:13 pm, June 27, 2020 "
Maggie also have a look at the protocols in this thread which vary in some area's from what has been posted as fact on the Crete forum https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
"Wearing a mask is not something I would do ( & I haven't so far) out of choice but I will obviously comply if/when we go away.To be fairI think that's the least of worries at the moment.I think the actual airport experience and the flight are the main concerns.Ideally, flight will be only half full and overhead lockers and toilets will be locked! Not likely but preferable.Still considering whether to travel or not but I think I know which way it's going as I have also been looking online at masks!Edited: 3:21 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"Extended periods of wearing the mask is one of the things concerning me. We have them and I really find them horrible to breathe through. My glasses steam up in next to no time when wearing one. For us it would mean wearing one for about 10 hours. 1 hour taxi from home, 2 hours minimum at airport, 4 hour flight, 1 hour disembarking and time at airport, 1 hour taxi to resort. Wearing them for short periods in shops I could live with.I know nurses etc have to wear them all day for their work, but I'm not going to work so have the option to travel or not."
Maggie I run a Crete group online with over 5000 members from numerous nationalities and I have ran a couple of polls on whether people are planning to travel and interestingly the vast majority are still hoping/planning to travel to Crete this season (although a number have of course already had their holidays cancelled and a number have also chosen to postpone to next year). It has also been great to see everyone in the group respecting each others decisions :-))
Cheers Jock. It says random checks depending on your QR ( quick response ) code . Any idea what that means? X
"I could take a good guess but I don't want to speculate :-) Here's another link to some of the protocols which seems to confirm that some of the speculation and information posted as facts on the Crete forum are actually inaccurate https://travel.gov.gr/#/ so here is the information.Protocol for passengers arriving by airArrival of passengers at the arrival gate.Transfer to the area where screening personnel are located and check the unique quick response (QR) code each passenger shows on their mobile phone screen or printed QR form.Screening personnel direct passengers, depending on their QR code, either to the screening area or to the exit (baggage claim area or passport control). Until the screening results become available, passengers tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by a trained health team are obliged to self-isolate at the address of their final destination as declared on their passenger locator form (PLF). Upon completion of the screening, they are directed towards the exit.All passengers must comply with all of the necessary preventive hygiene measures (use of masks and physical distancing).Protocol for passengers arriving by seaArrival of incoming passengers on foot at the main entry gate.Incoming passengers arriving in vehicles are directed to the special entry gate.All passengers are transferred to areas where screening personnel are located and check the unique quick response (QR) code each passenger shows on their mobile phone screen or printed QR form.Depending on passengers’ QR code, screening personnel either direct them to the screening area or allow them to enter the country. Until the screening results become available, passengers who are tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by a trained health team are obliged to self-isolate at the address of their final destination as declared on their passenger locator form (PLF). Upon completion of the screening they are allowed to enter the country.All passengers must comply with all of the necessary preventive measures (use of masks and physical distancing).Protocol for arrivals at land bordersArrival of persons at the checkpoint. All persons entering the country must submit a completed passenger locator form (PLF) upon their arrival.Passport and customs control are carried out and each incoming person’s unique quick response (QR) code is checked on their mobile phone screen or on the printed form with their QR code.Depending on their code, incoming persons are directed by security personnel either to the screening area or allowed to continue their trip to their final destination in the country, receiving instructions from the border personnel, concerning, in particular, required action in case they develop symptoms of respiratory infection, in which case they must immediately contact the National Public Health Organization (EODY) Operations Centre. If arriving persons plan to have multiple stop-overs in Greece, they must declare this and report their initial destination and their travel itinerary for the next 7 days. EODY Mobile Health Units (KOMY) will operate round the clock at land border checkpoints.Until the screening results become available, arriving persons who are tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are obliged to self-isolate at the address of their final destination as declared on their passenger locator form (PLF). Their data is entered into the EODY information system, which is linked to the COVID registry to facilitate contact tracing in the event someone tests positive.

The link seemed to work this time haha :-)
One more question for tonight. Is the QR form the same as the passenger locator form? x
Yes Maggie QR is the bar code that is on a mobile device for an uploaded form ;-) x
Thanks Jock :-))x
You are very welcome Maggie :-) xp.s. I was pretty sure I knew what it was but wanted to double check first :-)
maggie m - the protocols have been fluid since international tourism resumed so there is probably a fair chance they will have changed again before your travel dates.
"Thank you Jock and Deb. Ive been reading a bit more this morning and the form only applies between now and August 31st as things stand now. As you both rightly say so much could change between now and September. All for the better fingers crossedEdited: 3:56 am, June 28, 2020 "
Hi all.QR form??
Hi Tomsk . Have a read of #15 from Jock. its the form everyone entering Greece will have to fill in at least until August 31st as things stand now. Also on the Greece forum there's a thread regarding protocols on entering Greece.
Hi.Many thanks.Found the online form will fill out when we get the nod from Jet2.Regards.
"Hi all. So as I understand the present system. When we enter destination airport random testing will take place and those tested will self isolate in hotel until result becomes available. Definitely having second thoughts about travelling now to be honest. Neither myself, wife or Daughter have any symptoms of Covid but from the little I know we could still be carrying the virus. If for instance one of us actually had the virus that's the holiday down the plug hole. May try and get tested in UK before travelling."
"tomski, the problem with getting tested a few days before travel is that it doesn't mean you can't test positive later. Incubation time seems to be anything between 5 and 14 days depending on which report you read. I absolutely agree that the thought of being quarantined on arrival is a worry. Also, what happens to other people who arrive on the same flight? Will they all be traced and ordered to isolate too?"
"Yes Tomski, that's right. The testing is not exactly random; the higher risk people, depending on the info on your form (eg your originating location) will be selected for testing. If you are selected for testing, you can travel to your destination, there you must self-isolate for the first 24 hours or so, until the test results are back. If you test positive you would then need to go to a 'quarantine hotel' in the region. & the track & trace process will find who you have been in contact with, so they can be quarantined as well."
Yes tomski you have it correct and in Chania airport they are carrying out 275 tests a day. Getting a test before you go might be a good idea just to check.It was interesting to read that travel firms in the UK were reporting record Saturday bookings with Greece being among the most popular news :-)
Even though there are not many people arriving in Greece right now there are people testing positive on arrival. What is the situation for passengers if just one person on their flight tests positive?
"#28. So if testing isn't random, they will test EVERYONE from a UK flight?#30 .good questionAnd is it even possible to get a test in the UK at the moment if you do not have any symptoms"
"I don't know the figure in Heraklion airport but in Chania airport there are 275 tests a day so no not everyone from the UK will be tested. I also don't know about England but I could get a test in Scotland if I wanted to (as could Mrs and Jnr (not so Jnr anymore haha) Jock).Edited: 8:19 am, June 28, 2020 "
Yes Jock. At the moment we can only access a test if we have symptoms. I'd welcome a test before departure and hopefully our guidance will change xx
Hi all.Unless the rules change before we depart end of August we will not be travelling. How many people who have booked to fly to Greece or its Islands are not aware of these rules??
