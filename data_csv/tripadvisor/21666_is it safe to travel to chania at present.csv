We are a couple in our seventies Fairly healthy at present but are confused about the Covid 19 situation My primary instinct is to cancel but we are booked with Ryanair and Alpharooms from Ireland The cancellation policies of both bodies are at least unclear We will travel if it means losing all our money Any advice on medical services etc on Crete would be very wellcome as we are first timers to crete
"Kalimera, there are no cases of the virus in Chania right now, yet.But in April nobody knows what the situation will be. Facts are changing day by day. You have to speak also with the hotel."
"There is much affection for Crete on this forum, quite rightly. But I'm not convinced you will get an objective and representative response to your question on here in many cases. Depends when you are due to travel of course. However, and it is only my personal view, I would not let the travel insurance and financial loss issues overly influence your decision on whether you should travel or not. I wouldn't be surprised if the conundrum is taken out of your hands by wholesale flight cancellations in the near future. Might just be the best option for all travellers, but not of course for those who depend on tourism income streams. Sorry, if I've offered you no reassurance."
HiTake a look at the following link https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18941…We wish that by April it will be all situation a thing of the past.

"I agree with Michael, a very fair reply."
"Hi JackUnfortunately, even the medical experts can not say with any degree of certainty what the situation will be like in 2 weeks but hopefully, fingers crossed, things will have turned for the better by the time your trip comes around. I can only suggest that you keep an eye out for our Government's travel advisories & check the Ryanair website on a daily basis.On a different note & sorry for throwing this on you but your travel insurance is also something that you may need to check out. If you cancel & the Ryanair flight goes as scheduled, Ryanair will be under no obligation to refund you & most insurance companies will not refund either if you cancel for reluctance to travel. Also, Aplharooms could be an issue if you have prepaid them. Even if Ryanair cancel the flight (Ryanair will then offer you a full refund or possibly, change of dates) your insurance company may say that the alpharooms cancellation falls under flight/travel disruption which is usually an add on at an extra cost to most standard policies. This happened to me when the beast from the east struck & my hotel booking on booking.com had passed the free cancellation point. I suggest you contact your travel insurance company for their take on that.Hopefully, by the time of your holiday, things will have improved sufficiently to allay any worries but at the moment, it looks like it is going to get worse before it gets better."
"I repost Airplanes, boats and auto rentals companies change the cancelation policy in favor of the customer.Check the cancelation policy with your providers and don't cancel your holidays because of panic."
It appears from a previous post that Jack has booked to travel to Crete in April.
"Hi Jack, as you have booked already you should wait to see what happens. As Europe is going into lockdown, airports and borders have begun closing, this means that you may have no choice except to stay at home for the foreseeable future."
"I am not sure that the views of those with a commercial interest in tourism should have the benefit of this platform, unless the advice is balanced and objective. It is only natural that those persons / companies have a vested interest at what is without doubt a dreadful time for the travel industry.. The timing could not have been worse. However, the advice 'don't cancel your holidays because of panic' is patronising and unhelpful. Just my personal thoughts, others may differ."
"Hi, JackI live near Chania & have read that there are 5 cases of the Coronavirus on Crete at the moment. This is a list of those places which have been closed for 14 days from today, but that could be extended. This applies to the whole of Greece, not just Crete.• Shopping centers• Cafes, bars and catering services with the exception of delivery and take-away services (if they have a seating area, they must close)• Entertainment centers• Cinemas, theaters, auditoriums• Libraries• Museums, archaeological and historical sites• Gambling agencies, casinos, gaming clubs with the exception of street vendors and online gambling• Sports facilities, sports clubs, cultural clubs and clubs (excluding outdoor sports areas as specified in the JMD)• Theme parks (amusement parks etc) / public outdoor recreation areas are excluded.• Hairdressers, fitness centers, beauty salons, beauty houses, tattoo / tattoo and skin / body care centersThis will remain law for at least 14 days."
"Jackie cases are three, two Greeks, one German professor."
"I read 5, but you might be right, but it really doesn't matter., does it?"
"It is not a big difference, let's pray that the number stays very low..."

"The situation in all countries is so fluid at present that there is no point trying to guess what will be happening in 48 hours time, never mind in a month. Holiday flights from the UK to Spain turned round and returned to the UK today because of the travel restrictions put in place by the Spanish government."
"""The situation in all countries is so fluid at present that there is no point trying to guess what will be happening in 48 hours time, never mind in a month.""+1 to this."
"#17. Still plenty of flights landing in Alicante, Spain this afternoon from the UK so clearly no overall travel restrictions (yet!). Think it is more the tour operators’ own decisions. TUI, at the present time, have only suspended their flights to Spain for two days. Jet2 are clearly looking ahead and anticipating the worst. Am mentioning this only to register that, even if flights in from the UK are still allowed (for any destination I imagine), the tour operators will make their own decisions as to whether to fly or not."
"Look around in Europe. Denmark has closed its borders for all foreigners. Italy dont allow their own inhabitants to leave their homes. All Greek restaurants are so far closed for the next two weeks. The Norwegian Ministry of foreign affairs have given travel advice : Do not travel. If you are abroad : come home. Airports around Europe are like ghost towns. Flights are cancelled. The Norwegian travel insurance companies say . Come home or your insurance is not valid for the next month. It will certainly be worse before it gets better. It doesn't matter if Crete is an island. The virus doesn't know borders, and it travels by airplanes. It travelled very fast from China to Italy. It came into Norway by plane following Norwegian ski tourists returning home from Italy.. Everybody should stay home until the situation are under control.Edited: 12:45 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Periscope, well said. I think it's the perfect answer when people asking ."
"It certainly is a sensible, informative answer.It's interesting that most of the questions from people who seem not to have an understanding of the seriousness of the situation, and who are hoping to be assured that they needn't change their travel plans, are coming from posters in the UK and the US - the two countries whose governments have not so far made a proper job of dealing with the virus, or of informing their citizens.Edited: 3:15 pm, March 14, 2020 "

The government seems very proactive and on the ball, quite impressive really.BUT: if you don't belong here (i.e. have a place where you could comfortably hunker down until this crisis passes) do not travel to Crete at the moment. It is not the right time for tourists."
">It is not the right time for tourists.< Absolutely - and not just from our own viewpoint as disappointed holiday-makers, but from Greece's too. Looked at like that, the proactive decision of the Greek government to close tourist accommodation now, before the season starts, is very wise: it protects the country from the usual huge influx of visitors, which would increase the rate of infection and put extra pressure on the health services.Edited: 4:21 am, March 15, 2020 "

Or to say it even shorter : Greece is closed for foreigners at the moment.
