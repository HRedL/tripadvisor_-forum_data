I would think that discussing face coverings on public transport was fundementally importandt and yet it is deemed inappropriate. What may we be allowed to discuss that concerns safety when TRAVELLING.
"I think that the latest thread was zapped because the OP posted the incorrect link to the website, along with just posting a link but with no other text.The one prior to that was probably also deleted because, even though the correct link to the article was posted, the OP just posted a link with no other text.The OP in question has a history of posting links to news stories and other articles, but he gives no reason why he has posted the link, or his own view and/or opinions.Perhaps if the OP had said:""This latest news is really going to affect me because I find it difficult to breathe wearing a face mask. What do other people think, and isn't it too late to be implementing this?

May be in this particular instance I am not sure there need to be any text. The title was self explanatory. There are plenty of posts that have a link only. I replied to the one that already had one reply. Didn't seem any point in replying to the one that didn't then that was the first one to get zapped.After watching the News at Ten I am still unclear what a face covering is. A mask isn't a face covering. Do we need something that covers the eyes as well?If the link was incorrect why couldn't it have been amended rather than zapped.
This is what you should be wearing! ;-)https://www.insider.com/most-creative-face-m…

""">>> A face covering as opposed to a mask can be anything at hand.""Given that you could be fined for not wearing an appropriate face covering wouldn't it be a good idea to specify what this constitutes? Who will issue these fines. Seems that we never did get the scientific view on whether masks were beneficial now it is compulsary to wear anything that you like that may may not constitute a face a covering. Would my hands covering my face constitute a face covering?"
"Answers to some of those questions:Do face coverings reduce risk and spread of coronavirus?https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun…As for enforcement, I'd imagine the hope is that enough people will fall in line without the BTP doling out fines en masse, but having that power in reserve if someone's being particularly obstreperous about it.Edited: 6:27 am, June 05, 2020 "
"Sorry, this should be a better linkDo face coverings reduce risk and spread of coronavirus?https:/…"
"""As for enforcement, I'd imagine the hope is that enough people will fall in line without the BTP doling out fines en masse, but having that power in reserve if someone's being particularly obstreperous about it.""I wouldn't mind betting the difference will come down to whether an offender is not wearing a face covering that meets the BTP's defintion and the offender lives in council house or is some way connected to the Government in which case anything goes."
"On the point of enforcement just who will enforce the wearing of a mask.On a train there are sometimes no guard and even if there is one he/she has no one to call upon to help until the train arrives in a station. Would be fun if someone refused to put their mask on and then was ejected from the train at speed.Same with a bus, only the driver to tell people and he is now behind a perspex screen so could be stopping every 5 minutes to tell people to get their mask onNot sure what other countries are doing to enforce masks"
"First, I didn't see anything wrong with the other threads and didn't report anything, despite guessing that I might well fall within the definition of an oldiewonk. I do think it's better to have a discussion in just one thread, though.As for whether the face coverings would be any good, then I have my doubts. The science is indeed uncertain, and my own opinion is that making something up out of things you happen to have lying around, is likely to be right at the bottom of the scale of effectiveness.Wales and Scotland have not followed suit yet. I don't know about Northern Ireland."
"I don't think it's complicated. Either you are wearing something that covers your nose and mouth or you aren't. That something can be a mask, a scarf, a piece of cloth etc. I have even seen people with the neck of their top pulled up over their faces. All of these seem to be more effective at preventing the spread of disease in enclosed spaces than not wearing anything at all.I took the tube for the first time in months earlier this week (for medical treatment). Despite numerous signs asking passengers to cover their faces while using the service, only a minority of people were doing so. One woman with no face covering was talking loudly on her phone (talking seems to be one of the things that spreads the virus). Luckily, there were only 2 of us in the carriage at that point and I was able to keep far away from her. The scientific evidence I have seen indicates that face coverings are effective in preventing the person wearing the covering from spreading the virus to others. As a significant proportion of those infected appear to have no symptoms and people appear to be capable of transmitting the disease before they start to have symptoms, wearing masks/face coverings by apparently healthy people seems sensible, particularly in situations where social distancing is difficult or impossible."
"The guards haven't been coming through the carriages to check tickets on the EMR, Northern, Merseyrail, West Midlands Trains and TfW services I have been using, so they won't be able to see who is or isn't wearing a mask.Unless they check everyone on the platform before they board the train, which isn't really practicle as it would cause delays, especially if it's an 11 coach Pendolino.Or they could have inspectors and/or the British Transport Police doing random checks on trains, but they are probably more understaffed than other police forces and haven't got the resources. Meanwhile, other countries such as Czech Republic made it compulsory to wear face masks since their lockdown began. And guess what, they have eased restrictions, face masks are no longer mandatory, and the majority of shops, pubs, restaurants etc are now all open again!"
"""I don't think it's complicated. Either you are wearing something that covers your nose and mouth or you aren't. That something can be a mask, a scarf, a piece of cloth etc.""Everything that I have seen says ""cover the face"". A mask covers the nose and mouth.""face fās ► n. The surface of the front of the head from the top of the forehead to the base of the chin and from ear to ear.""By definition a mask doesn't cover the face? Or is this another woolly Government diktat designed to punish the low educated and allow the better educated to wriggle through?"
"Also I see the check as being on entry and exit to the station, no face covering then you don'y even get to enter the station. Unless you are on your way out, then you get fined. Once on the train then it will be a free for all.On a slightly different subject this was very interesting to watch and confirms Boris is a complete clown https://www.channel4.com/programmes/coronavi…"
"I’m not sure about anyone else, but I wouldn’t look like the photo on a travelcard if I’m wearing a face mask or covering."
"Re. BTP powers: when Grant Shapps did the evening press conference yesterday he finally conceded (after was almost virtual finger nail pulling to make him) that they haven't actually put the face covering rule into a law! It is being included as a ""Condition of Carriage"" - meaning the staff can refuse to take passengers without face coverings. And 90% of you just realised where this will all go wrong! First, thanks to DfT policy more and more trains have no guards. Second, guards will be very wary about getting close and arguing, several staff within London have already died of infection. Third, if staff call for police, BTP can only cover a small part of the network and whilst county forces do have the same powers they don't know the bylaws so won't want to get involved. Chaos is almost guaranteed, followed by government u-turn and a new law sometime in mid June."
"As @23 states there is pretty conclusive evidence that if you are asymptotic there is less chance of you passing the virus to someone in an enclosed space if your nose and mouth are covered. If someone was coughing or sneezing near me on a train I’d feel a bit more comfortable if they did have a face covering.This is all about trying to protect those around us so I would hope that whether this rule is enforced or not people still make the effort to cover up.Edited: 10:22 am, June 05, 2020 "
">>> As @23 states there is pretty conclusive evidence that if you are asymptotic there is less chance of you passing the virus to someone in an enclosed space if your nose and mouth are covered <<<======Where is this conclusive evidence?The scientific evidence is extremely flakey to say the least on the benefit on none clinical masks and eye protection, the logic we are being fed is flawed too. It prevents passing infection on, but can't protect oneself, how does that work?The Guardian article posted further up the thread, for a lay article was a really good balanced piece on face protection/masks and I venture is recommended reading. Furthermore Shapps this morning couldn't have put a more persuasive case forward for the ineffectiveness masks if he tried, perhaps he was trying?Edited: 10:56 am, June 05, 2020 "
"""Also I see the check as being on entry and exit to the station, no face covering then you don'y even get to enter the station. Unless you are on your way out, then you get fined.""Not all stations are manned. My local station that I commute from is manned, but not all of the time; and the people in the ticket office often hide away or close the ticket office when they feel like it. They could get security guards at every station, but that isn't financially viable, especially because so few people are using the trains at the moment."
"Apparently, the ""standard"" for face masks is that if you can blow out a candle with it on, it's not good enough.I have some motorcycle ""snoods"" or ""buffs"" which do the job, and they're washable."
"'One woman with no face covering was talking loudly on her phone (talking seems to be one of the things that spreads the virus).' Talking loudly on one's phone especially if in speaker mode is poor behaviour at the best of times, but normal speech doesn't increase the risk of spread of the virus.The spread is thought to be via droplets rather than aerosolised. Reducing the risk can be done with distancing when possible.The science of protection with masks is still not clear. In the last few days when outside I'd say half of those who had masks or face coverings were wearing or using them inappropriately, with the masks on the chin or forehead if not pulled out of a pocket and placed on when the person entered a building.I think at this stage the wearing of masks is cosmetic, an attempt to be seen to be doing something to slow the spread rather than being done following evidence-based practice. It's also not a reason to reduce the need for physical distancing."
"@31, ok so perhaps the word ‘conclusive’ might not have been the most appropriate but there still seems to be very good evidence in favour of wearing a face covering. ‘The Lancet’ recently did the largest study of it’s kind across 16 countries and concluded that there is a benefit to Face Coverings.At the end of the day there certainly isn’t hard evidence to say that face coverings don’t help check the spread and as long as that’s the case people who are in close proximity of others should use them."
"""It's also not a reason to reduce the need for physical distancing.""Don't get me started on that. In my experience the people who wear masks and/or gloves are some of the biggest culprits for ignoring the 2 metre rule. ""Hey, I'm going to ignore the one way system in the supermarket and get as close to you as I can while I have a good feel of this freshly baked bread and these tomatoes. Don't worry, I'm alright Jack, because I'm wearing a mask and have on the same disposable gloves that I've been using all week!""Edited: 2:03 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"^^ That happens in my city too, it's thoroughly annoying.If The Lancet study examined virus transmission by those who used masks correctly and found a reduction that's one thing. If it did not take into consideration those who wear masks incorrectly, keep them in pockets and use them on an as needed basis, and add in the extra fillip of those who use cloth face coverings but do not keep them scrupulously clean thereby turning a face covering into a potential estate twice the size of Robin Hood Gardens for all organisms then the results may not be as conclusive as one would hope."
#32 Yes I am assuming all stations will be manned in some way even if that means a security guard and not a railway employee. If they don't do that then what is the point. Where I am all stations are gated anyway.The wording was you would not be allowed to travel if you didn't have a face covering. That is quite clear. How on earth do they intend to enforce that if stations are open to people to come and go as they please.I suppose thet could make use of cctv if there were people behind the scenes to take action.
"""I’m not sure about anyone else, but I wouldn’t look like the photo on a travelcard if I’m wearing a face mask or covering.""hahahaha good point, how are they going to check all those photo cards. Unless they entrap you to remove your face covering then fine you for not wearing the covering."
"Gardengirl. I just haoppened to flick over to Channel 4 and missed the start of this programme. I picked it up where at the end of January when the Government was engrossed in leaving the EU by the 31 Jan. I was out of the UK in Thailand all of January and there it was virus virus virus. So I had no idea how the UK was dealing with it. Well not dealing with it seems.The programme was real eye opener. Now it easy to say with hind sight but this is the Government after all and they are supposed to rely on experts. If we did employ random people off the street then I can understand things going wrong.There was one funny bit when one of the experts violantly opposed to the shambolic Government response said that he didn't normally resort to it but he was shouting at the tv when the Government trotted out their pathetic garbage.I just hope that I live long enough to see the results of the impending public enquiry.I just happened to catch a bit of Question Time last night and some Government idiot was going on about how they have learnt lessons. Wasn't that what projevt Cygnus was for to learn the lessons, not the actual pandemic. My tv nearly went out the window when I heard that."
If you use public transport you just need to a accept that you must use a face covering. Have had eldest son ranting about it all day and quoting various studies that outline why it is not relevant but he will have to get on with it when he returns to work.Fortunately I went past our local train station and there were only 3 cars on the carpark so I think he will probably have very few fellow passengers at the time he travels.Glad it's not applicable to me.I see that social distancing is no longer necessary if you wear a mask.At least that is what I observed on my latest weekly shopping trip.

Yes leuca I agree!Love to sit down with a coffee and a tipping thread.Don't get quite the same enjoyment from a face mask discussion/ rant.Wonder why?
"Will tipping become the new normal in the UK?Let's face it, lots of people in the hospitality industry and also hairdressers/barbers have been furloughed or lost their jobs and been forced to clain benefits.Once the pubs, restaurants and hairdressers/barbers etc start to reopen, are we going to feel sorry for the employees who have been out of work for several months and start tipping them to give them a bit of a boost so they can get their lives back on track financially!?I've been very fortunate, because my office has stayed opend throughout the lockdown and I've been going to work 9-5 Mon-Fri all the way through this! As soon as the barber I use reopens (Tony Slavin on Penny Lane, formerly Bioletti's featured in THAT song!) I will be more than happy to pay a 50% tip if it means getting rid of this bird's nest that is growing on my head right now! ;-p"
"I would pay double the usual charge after discovering my natural hair colour ( no, it's not grey).Have told my hairdresser I need the first possible appointment .Husband as helpful as ever suggested the local dog groomer ( we know him) but he had a waiting list of 80 dogs needing hair done when he reopened.Know it's a minor problem though."
