Are there still checkpoints at each side of the provincial border? eg. ontario to manitoba? ontario to quebec?
It's my understanding the ones between Ontario and Quebec have been removed.Why don't you check the Ontario and Manitoba provincial websites for updates?
No checkpoints but travel withing certain areas of Quebec is still restricted. This site may help you https:/â€¦
"I am not aware of checkpoints, but Manitoba requires a two-week self-isolation when you enter the province, even if coming from within Canada. I posted the links to the health order on the MB government website on another thread earlier today."
Quebec / Ontario will be open on Tuesday 19th
I assume you are talking about the SQ removing blockade between Gatineau and OttawaThis does not mean that non essential travel is invited or wanted however. Both governments are still discouraging non essential travel between provinces
Harcon - the SQ were stopping people on the 401/20 - just past the border. Also at Hawkesbury and a few other entry points from Ontario as well. Especially (obviously) those that led to the more vulnerable regions. It's my understanding the ones at Hawkesbury and on the 401 have been stopped now.
"@ phpr Your point is well taken, however, Ontario still does not want tourists and neither does Quebec for that matter.The way that Bonjours post was written it seemed to indicate that all is as normal. Which, to my knowledge it is not."
