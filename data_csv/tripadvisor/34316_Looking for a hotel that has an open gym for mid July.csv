"Need to be near Wrigley. Yes, I know their is no baseball. Under $250/night. Any suggestions appreciatedEllen"
Gyms aren't open.
Gyms are part of Phase 4 = https:/…restore-illinois-phase-4Phase 4 “might” occur in early July. Check www.booking.com for hotels with availability and amenities for your dates.
"Hotel Zachary, across Clark Street from Wrigley Field, has a fitness center. It's my understanding that the hotel has been closed during the pandemic, so you will have to find out if it has reopened, if the rates are within your budget and whether Chicago has moved into Phase 4 by your travel dates. Please note that even if we move into Phase 4, if there is a resurgence of cases, we can move back into a more restrictive phase, so there cannot be any assurance that you will get what you want.And I believe the U.S. border is still closed to Brits.Edited: 7:54 am, June 16, 2020 "
"I’m wondering if hotels will even open their gyms, since they aren’t usually staffed."
"I must be behind the times but, has travel between the UK and USA opened up? Wrigleyville is a neighborhood so there are few hotels in the area. The Zachary is at Wrigley and the newest but they are still closed. The Versey at Diversey and Broadway/Clark Street, May be open but it is an older hotel so if they have a gym it is a retrofit. We’ve just entered phase 3 of reopening and, IMO, it is underwhelming. IF we do enter phase 4 next month it will be slow. You say that you “need” to come so it must be important business. Chicago isn’t ready yet.Edited: 11:02 am, June 16, 2020 "
"I agree with WJ in post no. 4. Even when gyms are permitted to open in Phase 4 (likely to be early July), hotels may choose not to open their fitness centers. The state will likely impose protocols on the gyms that require frequent disinfection between users and similar labor-intensive protective measures. Commercial gyms may be able to accommodate these extra procedures but I doubt that hotel-based fitness centers will. In fact, 60 Minutes had a segment this past Sunday about the heightened measures that Hilton is adopting for reopening its hotels. In lieu of use of a fitness centers, patrons evidently can have fitness equipment delivered to their room, possibly for an additional fee."
No I don’t believe travel has opened up. And doesn’t GB have a 14-day quarantine in place for people entering the country? Or is it only for non-citizens?

"Most of Chicago’s hotels are downtown or river north. There aren’t a lot in the neighborhoods. The ones listed in the previous posts are the only ones near Wrigley. You’ll have a lot more options if you’re willing to stay downtown. Is there somewhere specific you’re visiting? Obviously no baseball going on now.The USA border has never been truly closed to brits. If you’re a foreign resident that’s been in the UK or other countries in the above link in NC the past 14 days then you can’t come. But theoretically you could fly to some non-banned country and stay there until the 14 days have passed.Edited: 5:51 pm, June 16, 2020 "
Non essential travellers from the UK are still not allowed. The UK quarantine is for travellers entering or returning to the UK.
