"We are due to travel to San Francisco next Tues, and was wondering if it was still worth it, or will most shops, restaurants etc.. Be closed"
"Shops and restaurants will still be open, as of now.But frankly, I would recommend not traveling at this time. It's a pandemic. It requires all our cooperation to bring this under control. It's not about each of us individually, but it's about being a good global citizen.Google ""flattening the Coronovirus curve"" to get a perspective."
"Same situation hereDue to travel from UK next week. Unfortunately due to Mr Trump apparently not realising the UK is part of europe and not including the country in the travel ban, we have to proceed with our plans.Airline won't refund our tickets, and travel insurance won't pay out as flights are going ahead. There is also the issue of money pre paid for hotels and attractions.So it looks like we're coming."
Just take all precautions here like you would at home and you should be fine. Work on not touching your face before you leave home. Buy hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes after arrival and wipe down every surface in your hotel room after check in.
"You don't ""have to"" proceed with your plans. Doing so is extremely ill advised IMO."
I’m sure your government will put pressure to allow you to change your travel options. The company can’t alienate its customers.
Bring disposable gloves if possible.
"You don't ""have to"". You choose to, with all the possible unforeseen circumstances. What if someone on your flight tested positive and you are all required to be quarantined for 14 days?"
then why ask? and bring your own TP
"Dawn #2,I understand your quandary.We have just the opposite situation, in that we are to fly SFO-LHR quite soon.United Airlines will make concessions for us, while the Conrad St James will not - yet. As wife was to host a board meeting, we have a rather large suite, with a conference room sized dining room. Board meeting has been cancelled, for a conference call, instead. Sort of on hold, waiting to see how things sort out. We might just have to eat a rather stiff cancellation fee at Conrad, but only time will tell.Best of luck in your decision.Hunt"
"Will the airline allow you to change your flight dates? I am due to fly to San Francisco 21st March and today have pretty much made the decision that I won't be going. I am flying with Virgin and they are allowing fee-free changes to flights for anyone due to fly between last week and 30th April. My hotel is not paid for yet and is cancellable, the basketball match I booked won't happen to will get a refund, so at the moment it's only Alcatraz and the airport lounge at LHR I won't get a refund on. My hotel has suggested I could move the booking to a later date instead of cancelling - might be worth checking whether yours is willing to do similar under the circumstances?I would agree that you don't ""have to"" go. Yes you have paid already, and you won't get a refund (unless travel advice changes). But this is money you have already spent, and presumably could afford to spend. You won't lost any more money if you don't go, so won't be put into debt. (but I appreciate the huge annoyance of having spent a lot of money and not getting a holiday in return) I have spent a lot of time debating with myself and trying to come to a decision, and am very frustrated that non-essential travel has not been advised against, but I concluded that this is not the right time to be travelling halfway across the world. There is too much uncertainty - will the US let me in? Might the rules change while I am at the airport or on my flight? Might I inadvertently spread the virus while on my travels? Might I get quarantined in SF? Might I have to self isolate on my return?"
"Just to add that I am waiting to the last possible moment to sort out rebooking my flight, just in case there is official government advice not to travel. and I can just get a refund/insurance payout. If that happens I will still come to San Francisco at some point, but on a date which suits me, rather than one determined by Virgin."
"Last weekend everyone seemed to feel a little anxious but going about their normal routine. Things have really changed as of last night. I’d rethink any major travel right now. It’s not like panic in the streets thank goodness but we’re definitely operating in uncharted waters right now. The US airlines are waving change fees, but even if they weren’t what does it cost? $100 or so. I’d say it’s worth the loss."
We got into Sf Sunday night. We leave today. If we were home I would not be flying today.
"This question is a hard one to call, as many wouldn't travel abroad and others would.FWIW, I wouldn't travel abroad because the potential of exposure to COVID-19 increases exponentially and the virus is easily/quickly passed to others before symptoms manifest."
"Which airline? Which hotel? I believe United, Virgin and BA all have generous reschedule policies now, as do many hotel chains."
"Managed to get my daughter a flight out of Madrid Sunday to Heathrow then home before they quarantine the City for 30 days starting Monday. I feel comfortable here as we don't have the same population density as Europe. We have adequate hospitals and public health, but just be aware.Edited: 12:08 am, March 13, 2020 "
"In San Francisco, senior centers and public schools are closing to slow person-to-person transmission. You can get updates at www.sfchronicle.com and www.sfgate.com. There are a lot of uncertainties. No one can force you onto the plane if you feel the risk is too high."
"The problem is we are receiving different information in different countries. The US government have gone onto full blown panic mode, whereas the UK government is still very much in the phase of carry on as normal but wash your hands. Who is right is anyone’s guess - I personally think we should be somewhere between the two. Luckily I’m not travelling until late June, and hopefully it will have all blown over by then, but if I were travelling in the next few weeks, I’d still be going if there wasn’t a way of rescheduling without a large fee. It may be selfish in the opinion of some, but I’m not willing to lose the money I’ve spent the last three years saving very hard for so I can go on my dream trip. Especially when the UK government is still telling us it’s fine to travel. I would be taking the same precautions as I would if I were visiting London. (Wash hands, avoid close contact etc) It’s a very difficult situation."
"Most sightseeing stuff is closed. No museums, no theater. It’s kind of creepy, like a weird sci-fi movie. Complain on that hotel’s website and see if you get some action. Shame on them for not playing their role in this emergency."
"I am not sure BA's reschedule policy is that generous, unless their website isn't up to date. This is Virgin's:To give you greater peace of mind with your upcoming travel plans, we've introduced a flexible no change fees policyfor bookings made before 12 March, for travel between 1 March and 31 May 2020. Travel can be rebooked between 13 March 2020 and 31 December 2020.for bookings made between 4 March and 31 March., travel can be rebooked between 4 March 2020 and 31 December 2020.This means that if your plans do need to change, you can switch your flight to an alternative date with no penalty. Rebooked flights will be subject to availability and any difference in fare.You can also choose to re-route on a Virgin Atlantic or Virgin Atlantic Codeshare flight to or from your original destination, or rebook to or from another destination.Travel must be completed on or before 31 December 2020.This seems to be BA's:We understand that sometimes your travel plans need to change. That’s why we’ve introduced two new options to give you the flexibility to adapt to unexpected circumstances:1. To change your date of travel for freeYou can change the travel date on flight bookings made between Tuesday 3 March and Tuesday 31 March without paying a change booking fee (any fare difference must still be paid). Simply rebook under ‘Manage My Booking’ for any new date, up to 12 months from your original date of departure. For holiday bookings please see Terms and Conditions below.Manage My Booking2. To change your destination, date of travel, or both for freeYou can now exchange bookings made between Tuesday 3 March and Tuesday 31 March for a voucher of the same value. Your voucher can be used as part payment towards a future booking to any destination. It must be redeemed for travel on flights taken within 12 months of your original date of departure. So if you booked before 3rd March you have to pay a change fee. Virgin also have info on phone line wait times on their website - can't see anything like that on BAs"
"It is inaccurate to say “no museums”....some are open but with no docent tours.That being said, it is accurate to say that a huge amount of vibrancy is drained away. You don’t “have” to come. Health is more important than money, especially with enjoyability substantially reduced."
"Hi, partner of the original poster here!So, we're with British Airlines. They are allowing changes only on flights booked since March 3rd for free. In other words they are trying to prevent their current bookings from dropping off too much rather then help out people who booked in good faith before this all started!I'm trying to get hold of somebody to see if we can change the flights for a fee, but I can't get through and it isn't possible to do this on the website. Our ticket terms and conditions are no refunds and no changes, so I suspect we won't be able to make any changes anyway.Travel insurance doesn't apply unless UK goverment makes the USA a no travel advisory.Therefore if nothing changes and we don't travel, we'll be around £1800 down on the flights (upgraded from economy), and more depending on hotel/car hire/attractions that have been pre paid unless they will refund.This is why we will be coming regardless - even if it's a bit of a ghost town!"
">> I'm trying to get hold of somebody to see if we can change the flights for a fee, but I can't get through and it isn't possible to do this on the website.Can you go to the airport and do it at a ticket counter?"
"Don't know why our wise and omniscient president exempted the UK. Your own PM thinks the UK has 10,000 infection cases.Sorry for your predicament. BA will bear the reputational cost of this inflexibility."
Weird isn't it. Almost as if he doesn't consider the UK part of Europe. Maybe he thinks leaving the EU means we've drifted out into the Atlantic.Probably just an error that he doesn't want to be seen to go back on. Or it's political.
">>This is why we will be coming regardless - even if it's a bit of a ghost town!<<Dr. Fauci has publicly said that it's going to get worse before it gets better. Your health is worth more than money. And everyone's health is worth more than your money. There is talk now about banning domestic travel into ""hot spots."" If it were just you getting sick that would be one thing. But this virus spreads when people are out among one another."
Let us postulate you come. What are you seeing? What do you do if you get infected? With enjoyability less likely and risk.....you do your own calculus.
"Neil J, did you use the ""change/cancel"" link in Manage My Booking to see what options are actually available? I canceled our non-refundable booking for a flight from Venice to London scheduled for March 20, and got the taxes back. It wasn't much, but for an international fright from Heathrow to the US the taxes can be considerable.Edited: 1:36 pm, March 13, 2020 "
">> Don't know why our wise and omniscient president exempted the UK.The goal was to ban travel to/from Italy, which is in far worse shape than other European countries including the UK. However, since Italy doesn't control its own borders and people lie about where they've been, the only way to achieve that goal is to ban travel to/from the Schengen Area, which includes the 26 nations that have chosen to act as if they are a single country for travel purposes. I know the media headlines just say ""Europe"" or ""Most of Europe"" but if you actually read the articles, they usually do explain that the order applies to the Schengen Area. I presume our British friends are just venting and they do understand that the reason they're excluded from the ban is because they never joined Schengen, not because of Brexit or because we don't know they're in Europe. Even our inept Pres is not that dumb. This would be the same if another country decided to ban visitors from Florida. All Californians would also be banned because there's no way to know which of us were in Florida recently since there are no passport controls on our state borders. There are both advantages and disadvantages to being in a Union."
I still say that if you aren't able to rebook - you call out the airline on their Facebook page. Enough people do that and they will change their policy.
"I haven’t looked, but there may already be a campaign against BA inflexibility and fees in the UK. Join them.Go on the UK travel forum site for starters."
"I have to say I am pretty appalled by BA's inflexible rebooking policy around this, and currently pretty impressed with Virgin's. United seem to have a similar policy to Virgin. I have flights booked within Europe with BA in June. After that (whether or not I actually get to travel) I would be very very reluctant to book flights with BA in future."
"Just now, looks like they will let you change:}To allow greater flexibility, we are enabling customers to change their destination, date of travel, or both for free, on all new bookings made from Tuesday 3 March to Sunday 31 May 2020, *******as well as any existing bookings that depart up to Sunday 31 May 2020. ******}"
"Hi, I was supposed to travel to San Francisco on Monday. I made the decision to cancel and that has cost me a few thousand of dollars and my travel insurance won't pay a dime. I'm very angry at my government for not banning travel to the US. Basically the airline and the travel insurance are acting like it's a whim of mine to cancel. If I go, I will be stuck in a city where everything is closed, which is not a very nice trip. I will then have to be quarantined when I come back without pay for 14 days. The prime minister has asked to cancel all non essential travel and the state of emergency has been declared in the US. But the travel industry is acting like everything is normal. The government has basically chosen the millionaire travel industry over us. Damn shame. But at the end of the day, what convinced me to cancel without a refund is that I am human too and I can get that damn covid19 and die. I can give it to other people at home who can die. So I lose a couple thousands and I cry and rant against my government. It's all there is left to do."
Cannot believe BA's inflexibility. Other airlines are issuing credits or refunds. I think their policy is going to have to change in the next few days.
If flying from out of the country I'd recommend no. If in the states I would say yes. As there are different rules and regulations from out vs within.
"Since BA is letting you change everything, including date and destination, for all tickets for travel through the end of May now, see what happens if you do a trial ""cancel"". It might end up as a credit; that's how it worked on United's website, so worth a try (obviously see if that what happens before finalizing it).Edited: 12:45 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Andrea - if the airline changed its policy soon after you cancelled, you might be able to get them to at least credit you for future travel."
">>FWIW, I wouldn't travel abroad because the potential of exposure to COVID-19 increases exponentially<<I hadn't heard this... If two cities of x population have y cases, why would your risk of contracting COVID-19 be different in the UK versus the US?"
Me an my wife are in exactly the same position can’t understand why president trump will let uk an Ireland fly an guess what yep we fly to Dublin then to San Francisco we are in a no win situation we go an hate it with possible quarantine or we stay at home an lose £2500 pounds without getting a penny back an there’s nothing we can do I went to Tavel agents an said where do we stand an they said your good to go no ban on uk shocking or another way of putting it we’re losing the money because well we can’t go
"Do your part to flatten the curve, Marc. Stay away. Sorry for your loss."
"Marc,Which airline are you scheduled with? As the status of everything changes day to day - if not minute to minute - everyone's change/refund policies keep changing, too. Many airlines just changed their policies to more generous ones in the past few days. Keep checking (until the last minute). You dont' lose more money by waiting to the last minute, and things may change in your favor (from a financial standpoint, anyway)."
Because we booked though a travel agent the air line has to deal with the 3rd party an due to amount of people trying to change dates on there holiday it’s near impossible to get through our travel agent as been on hold for 3hr
"You probably have a confirmation number for the airline reservation if you check everything from the travel agent. (Same is true for those who reserve through third parties like expedia). Check to see if you can find it and then plug it into the airline website. Worth a try, anyway. If you can't find it, can you contact the agent via text, email, Twitter etc. to see if they can at least send you the numbers (for hotels, flights, whatever)?"
I agree with SFSusan’s point. But my personal opinion is there is higher risk in the airports and on the plane where you are in close corridors with others and breathing recycled air.
Travel from UK and Ireland by foreigners is banned as of Monday.
"Yep, problem solved - hopefully everyone has trip insurance."
Getting our money back a grey area we are due to fly out on Monday an land in San Francisco at 4.30 so it’s only 9.30 eastern time an ban only comes into affect at 12 midnight you couldn’t make it up why it’s was not immediate effect god only knows
Wow how frustrating.
Perhaps an immediate ban not implemented to allow folks visiting on either side of the pond to get home.
"You dont have to get on the plane.Probably when you arrive, you will be asked questions. If you wind up in a quarantine situation, the financial hit will be huge."
Whatever people do you shouldn’t cancel trips until the very last minute. A travel advisory may start or flights get cancelled for commercial reasons triggering full refunds.
Any logical and decent person does not travel now.
UK foreign office is now warning against all but essential travel to the USA. So hopefully airlines will refund and insurance will pay out for accommodation costs if the supplier can't /won't refund
US travel ban on foreigners from UK and Republic of Ireland goes into effect Monday midnight.
"Cancel, cancel, cancel.The UK itself has a travel advisory on the U.S. I believe."
"Liars #57,According to #16, seems that UK/Ireland are reciprocating: https:/…106044085I have seen a link to the full restrictions, but cannot seem to find it now.Hunt"
Full refund!!!! hopefully will get to see San Francisco back to its best later in the year
"Glad you are not coming.Practice social distancing at home, too. This is far from over in the U.K. and here."
We sadly just canceled our mid April trip to San Francisco. I prefer to think of it as “see you later.” We will rebook once things quiet down.
"If you read the most recent threads, you'll know the whole Bay Area is now just short of being under house arrest, so it would be neither wise nor enjoyable for you to come here for the next few weeks."
"The issue with this is that it can get worse and spread, so many cities are trying to control it by shutting down certain things. It is up to the people to listen or not otherwise it will continue to spread."
