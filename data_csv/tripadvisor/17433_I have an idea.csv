"When we were boarding the cruise ship, we had to sign a form asking in anyone in our party had any type of stomach virus symptoms. I think each resort should have a similar form. If anyone answers yes, the should be sent Amanyara, where they would be together and away from the Grace Bay resorts. I am making lite of a serious situation. I am hoping that this virus will be under control soon. It does sound like the Norovirus that was on our cruise ship in March.Edited: 8 years ago "

I actually met the manager of Amanyara last trip. Nice guy.I dont think he would mind at all...
"Ziggy, Actually I have been thinking about this. I think you might be ""patient 1"" who started this epidemic. As I re call, you were the very first to report stomach issues. LOL."
"Please JG, you dont think I already ran this scenerio in my mind a few times ;)I knew something had to be wrong since I never ever ever get this"
Can I put 'yes' on the form even if I don't have it? Wouldn't mind staying at Amanyara.......
