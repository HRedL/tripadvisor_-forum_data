"Just wondering if anyone knows anything about domestic flights as I am having difficulties getting information. We due to fly in to Bangkok with Qatar Friday 20th March, up to now the flight is not cancelled.After Bangkok, we plan to travel south then on to Langkawi, Penang and Kuala Lumper, we have flights booked with malindo and airasia. We would be happy to spend the entire duration in Thailand if not able to transferIt's very difficult whilst in the UK to ascertain what is happening out there, if the FCO do not advise against it we would still like to travel. Are brits being shunned or are they still welcome? Or are our plans a bit ambitious?Thank you"

"Information isn't forthcoming here either. The government keeps changing its position. Although they say there is no problem, all the ministry heads are pointing fingers at who the say is responsible for the nonexistent problem. Personally, with new restrictions popping up almost hourly, and the distinct possibility that the virus is serious, I would forgo travel at this time. Taking away the fear that one might actually catch the virus, there is also a good possibility one could get caught up in a bureaucratic goat roping."

That is as of yesterday. Tomorrow could require something completely different.
Thank you for taking the time to respond
Malaysia has declared its borders closed so if OP was planning on travelling there he should consider changing plans. https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1880140/ma…

"Since the lockdown starts tomorrow, I'd really hate to need to get to the stores today!"
Anybody with up to date info in this please. FCO saying not to travel is not helpful when you are already away. We have been in Australia for the last 2 weeks before it kicked off badly. We are due to fly home via Bangkok and spend 3 nights there. Will we have to self isolate in Thailand in arrival or will we be free to do what we want. Worried then re getting back to UK. Realise we will have to self isolate when home. Airline not helpful as we used a booking agent. Booking agent really I help full and seem not to have a clue other than to say book anew flight and pay is more !!!! Any latest info really appreciated and understand this is changing daily.
I’m in koh samui due to go Bangkok Monday then home to uk Thursday next week. Where is lockdown please
Lockdown is in malaysia

Go to Thailand and enjoy. So far no plan of Lockdown there. Malaysia is full lockdown. Situation changing hourly but Thailand is fine.
"Hi ,did you cancel or redate your flight I thought Qatar were offering refunds? We are due to fly out 20th may..."
I’ve cancelled my Monday flight with Thai.
"""Will we have to self isolate in Thailand in arrival or will we be free to do what we want."" As of today, arrivals from the UK are free to do what they want as long as they have no symptoms."
Keep the updates coming.What I'd dont get is there are flights galore so enticing from heathrow ?This hasnt changed for over a week now.Of course uk Gov advise to not travel. Why cant they just stop them and out us out of our misery.
"OP asks about domestic flights in Thailand but none of their planned flights involving Thailand are domestic?I have a domestic flight to South Thailand on Saturday and another coming back to Bangkok at the start of March. I guess the Saturday one is close enough that nothing will have changed before then, but by the march one they may well have stopped everybody from going out in which case will the flights be cancelled or not... who knows.Mass panic and overreaction just so the hospitals don't run out of beds.Edited: 5:30 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Here In Koh samui Now and no restrictions
"We flew in last night (Wednesday 18th) TG from Hong Kong, connecting TG flight between Suvranabumi (BKK) to Phuket.Three LCC flying between HK and Phuket cancelled their flights at very short notice. Other than flying Dragon Air (a Cathay Pacific subsidiary airline) which was expensive, our only other choice was Thai Airways - even though it meant a longer (x2) journey, having to fly via BKK.IMO, Thai will continue flying domestically. They may cut down on the number of daily domestic flights - especially to tourist hotspots such as Phuket, but at least you know that you will get here - and so will your luggage.And, BTW, if flying Qatar, your luggage will go straight through, but make sure,that your two flights are linked on the ""system.""Looking at the arrivals board at Phuket airport last night/this morning. 16 international flights, which were scheduled to arrive between midnight and 8.00am - were cancelled. (mainly from China)So yes, your best bet would be to book your domestic flights on Thai. Will not be the cheapest option. But in times like this, economy is not the wisest of choices.Re Malaysia.I would skip Malaysia altogether due to the lockdown and 14 day quarantine restrictions.Edited: 2:07 am, March 19, 2020 "
I hope the OP was intelligent enough to ignore all the 'Pearl's of Wisdom' posted
Lots of people deleting their replies on various threads. Wonder why lol.
"You should probably delete a few of your scare monging, and ill informed opinion posts.USA hospitals will collapse BS for one, as both Thai and the USA health system is well prepared for any pandemic issues.According to WHO, USA #1 / Thai #6 of 195:https://www.ghsindex.org/"
""" ... the USA health system is well prepared for any pandemic issues.""But, that doesn't fit the anti-Trump media narrative."
Even if you can get in (14 day lockdown and extra paperwork). Bankgkok and kih Samui are ghost town. Fancy malls CLOSED. NO PLACE. To eat. Resturant/bar all closed. Take out food at smallshops. Wait. Don't go now.
Wake up. USA is in steep curve upward. No end in sight. Open eyes
"#29 You can't tell that to 'Not Me' According to this wise old man, this virus is less dangerous than a normal flu."
"Check that, add another 1000 to the count.""CDC in its latest report estimated that there had been at least 23,000 deaths related to the flu as of March 14.""And if you are a parent ... well CV is 'suspected' of killing only 1 teen at present, in the USAThe flu this season, has taken too many youngins.....136 That might not matter to some people. Other intelligent people, probably think differently.Have a nice dayEdited: 8:35 am, March 26, 2020 "
"Yes Not Me you are obviously more intelligent than the majority of health experts, so it is beyond me why you are a retired expat in Thailand, instead of saving the world with your wisdom.I choose to listen to people who has the expertise on this subject.Are you related to the dear great leader of the States?"
"I know your are, but what am I !?!Seriously?"
"It really is mind boggling. I hate to see the world, if some serious really happened."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned that the ..........“whole of humanity” is in danger...... of the coronavirus crisis, and we must all fight against it. ""Not to make lite of people dying, but the hysteria is a bit much. Million more die from the top 10 caused of death worldwide, and CV doesn't even put a dent in those numbers. https:/…Edited: 8:36 am, March 26, 2020 "
"The USA had 60 cases 1 month ago now it has over 68,000, no deaths one month ago now over 1,000 even you maybe able to see the growth. If countries had not taken action to contain this then 100s of millions would probably have by now and deaths also would in millions. Health systems don’t usually get overwhelmed by flu. New York reckons it’s going to run out of ventitors.Edited: 8:33 am, March 26, 2020 "
Take it to ThaiVisa

"If you want % then look at USA figures, 1 month ago 60 cases, now over 68,000 cases that is 113,333% increase. Cases in the USA are doubling about every 3 days, is 100% increase in 3 days. Deaths are likely to follow."

"According to WHO, USA #1 / Thai #6 of 195:https://www.ghsindex.org/The UK is number 2, hmmm, who did this research?"
HUmm...https://imgur.com/gallery/UhoOxcR
"Loki, I see the death rate in Italy is already 136 per 1,000,000 and most of those are from Lombardy, just a small area about 5% the size of Thailand. What was flu and pneumonia?USA has the highest number of recorded cases in the world. 1st March it had only 75 cases now over 85,000 with 17,000 yesterday."
"""Coming from UK Friday 20th March"""
"# 51and .... your point..... don't care. I'm in neither place Only care about 2 people & 1 dog. 1 is sick, probably CV19 and the other 2 are fine.When it hits the same numbers as the seasonal flu, it will still be a no drama to me, same as the flu. Post when it hits 1 million deaths.Though I'll probably give you the same reply.........don't care."
