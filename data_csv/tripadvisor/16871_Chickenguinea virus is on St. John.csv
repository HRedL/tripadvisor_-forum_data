"It has been 6 weeks since trip to St. John and I am still sick, barely able to walk, joints hurt, nausea and extreme fatigue. There were no warnings up at all about using mosquito repellant and mosquitoes are everywhere. No matter what beautiful beaches I saw there, it is not worth the pain, not to mention the expense of so many doctor visits. There is no cure. No Treatment and this stuff can last indefinately. Don't go. The family practice at Red Hook says they are seeing so many people coming in with this virus, some in wheelchairs that can't even walk in. They are not spraying and don't want the word out as it will effect the tourist season."
"I'll repeat what I said on one of the other two threads where you posted the same thing. I'm sorry you became ill but for as long as I can remember (and I'm pretty old so I'm also talking pre-internet), regular use of insect repellent has been advised to all travelers heading to tropical climates. On this forum alone we regularly advise visitors to pack sunscreen and Deet-containing repellent and use both regularly - and this admonition is carried on all other forums and countless travel sites, including the CDC website.It's chikungunya, there have been several threads created already on the subject, it's similar to dengue and it doesn't last ""indefinitely"" but different people react differently to it. To even intimate that we are unaware of it here or are deliberately withholding information on it in order not to deter visitors is simply ridiculous."
"Science shows that spraying a neighborhood does not kill the mosquito that causes this. Each individual needs to be responsible and spray, use citronella candles, wear long clothes. I live here and am sure to keep my house area dry. I watch for mosquito habitats."
The position of the DOH on fogging for mosquito control is explained in this recent article:stcroixsource.com/content/news/local-news/20…
Thank you for finding this article. Our Senator Craig barshinger was also trying to get the word out. It's up to each individual to make themselves safe. Be aware. Be safe.
A recent article cites an epidemiologist as stating that this is an epidemic in the Virgin Islands:virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epidemiologi…
"I repeat: I live here. My family, including my son with disabilities. We take care to stay away fromMosquitos and wear repellant. We stay away from standing water. FYI there's Lyme disease all over the mainland. Should I stay away from the mainland?"
"I have a lot of sympathy for the OP - I'm sure he (she?) is in a lot of distress. I believe that chikungunya (not chickenguinea) is painful and can last a long time. But let's be honest. If you are going to somewhere you are not familiar with, you should check it out. There have been warnings of chikungunya around for some time now. In a lot of places, including airports - I travel for a living and I've seen warnings in many airports on the mainland. Do the research and make an informed decision about where to travel. If you decide to go, take the proper precautions. But even when you do, you may not be successful. I'm willing to bet that there are people who get flu shots that still get flu. No-one is making you go to St John - it's your decision. Personally, I'm still going.And Hungrytraveler, while you are technically correct about Lyme 'all over the mainland', the facts are that it's only prevalent around the NE and Great Lakes. Let's not compound one over reaction with anotherEdited: 5 years ago "
"You are right. I show my east coast bias. You go to the southwest for the rat borne illness. The Deep South to get bit by chiggers. Alaska has mosquitoes the size of hawks. California has traffic. Not to mention mainland's tornadoes, water spouts, lightning strikes, blizzards, ice storms and hail.But somehow folks continue to live all over the USA and deal with the challenges. Adapt. Live. Enjoy."
"Perhaps if you had this stuff, you would be more understanding. There should have been warnings posted somewhere. None at tourism center or any of the stores. It was irresponsible of St. John not to inform tourists about this awful virus."
"There's a word that is on the tip on my tongue...wait, what is it....oh that's it ""Self Awareness"". Your message has been loud and clear in the 10+ posts you've made. We all hope you recover, but I don't think you've deterred anyone from going to STJ which seems to be your mission."
"I'm very sympathetic to your illness, but I was there in August and knew of the disease simply by reading the mainstream news. And I also was aware of it being on St. John (and all of the USVI and BVI) because of the ""what do see and where to go"" fact checking I did online, including on this forum. They are not hiding the information at all. In fact, I read up on the facts on the CDC website before I left for our trip. We packed DEET wipes and spray and did our best to not let it ruin our vacation."
"Titi,Looking on the bright side, you're now apparently immune to the virus. As a result, when it becomes an epidemic in the states [as many have proposed it will], you'll be able to gloat and tell everyone in FL ""I told you so!!"". By then, it'll be the newest story on every cable news show, like West Nile Virus before it, and everyone will be fully and personally informed in the coddling, hand-holding way you obviously expect."
"""There should have been warnings posted somewhere. None at tourism center or any of the stores.""As soon as you got off the 'plane you could have been bitten by a chikungunya-carrying mosquito so how on earth would a sign at the airport or the tourist center or a store have done you any good? You do your research BEFORE traveling to an unfamiliar part of the world, educate yourself and prepare yourself accordingly. Again, I'm sorry your reaction to the virus was so dramatic but there's no point in this continual barrage of condemnation, blame and advice to others not to come here simply because you failed to prepare yourself."
"I too am sorry you got the virus but the fact that you caught the bug doesn't necessarily give you any special insight and your stance begs the question - is your hometown of St. Augustine, FL doing the responsible thing? Is any state? I will tell you that here where I live in Virginia (where there have been confirmed cases stretching back to June) I don't see our health department or hotels taking steps to warn the travelling public. I'm aware of the illness and didn't know it had been reported this far north until I searched the internet this AM.I just returned yesterday from a visit to St Thomas. I met a number of people who have had it and more than a few that are still suffering lingering joint pain. I'll agree according to each of them it's a nasty illness but no one I spoke with felt the government or any particular segment of the tourism industry was responsible for their getting bit by an infected mosquito. It's unfortunate how many travelers take travelling to foreign lands so casually and then blame any misfortune on the surroundings. Know the local situation before you go; be grateful that this information is so readily available. Protect yourself otherwise you might get sick or thrown in jail. Bad stuff happens and you alone have the power to educate yourself."

We are traveling to St. John soon, and I have been busy with my due diligence in protecting ourselves while we have the time of our lives on St. John - again."
"Wow, this is almost exactly the same posts I have seen on the St Martin site. Someone shows up, has the virus, and their only posts are to try and scare people from traveling to said Island. Very suspicious...."
"I have traveled to India on business a couple of times. Needed to get shots before I went to prevent a number of potential diseases, as per CDC and work protocol. Still got sick the first time I went, due to my own carelessness (food at restaurant that looked questionable for cleanliness). Second time I went I was fine, since I increased my diligence on what not to eat/drink. I do not hold it against the country/ area I was visiting. I made the mistake in not excusing myself from eating at that particular place. Just take proper precautions as people have stated above. Consult CDC website before traveling, even within the US, to be better prepared for what you may come in contact with."
"Please know my posts are not suspicious. If you had this virus for even one hour you would understand what I am trying to get out. You couldn't pay me to go again. I wouldn't trust a repellent to deter this awful virus especially when I was literally covered in mosquitoes. The worst places were Honeymoon beach and the beach at Westin. Yes I should have checked out CDC warnings, but at the time there were none posted for St. John."
"My dear, had you used a repellent you wouldn't have been ""literally covered in mosquitoes"". and certainly not at two different locations as you might have learned from the first one. Had you even looked for cautionary information you wouldn't have found anything specific to St John (unless you came to this or a similar forum) because St John is part of the US Virgin Islands, just as Saint Augustine is part of Florida. Where you even looked period is baffling since all the travel forums have been discussing it for months.Unfortunately you simply weren't prepared but the continued blame-shifting and advising people not to visit here gets wearing."
"Again, I'm sorry for your illness, but I have to clarify something that you said. There were most definitely CDC warnings for the Virgin Islands about the virus being on-island before I traveled to St. Thomas/St. John, which was August 10. Trust me, the CDC warnings were there, because I read them and spent way too many hours researching the best bug repellents because of what I read.Edited: 5 years ago "

"I should mention it is not only St John - please see the following notification.....""Local transmission of chikungunya is now being reported in other countries in the Caribbean.

"I'm sorry I must have missed the warnings at the hotel and airport when I landed in Kansas City earlier this year of the chance I might catch Lyme disease, West Nile, Swine Flu and EV-D68. Like others I am sorry you are ill but the information is out thre and easy to find Pia"
"Pia - Oh my! Where are we to go?!!! Your list covers just about every island in the Caribbean. Oh well, back to St John for us end of November. I'll take bug repellent and take my chances."
"I am very sorry that this person got sick. I am a mosquito magnet and thus hit my self with deet many, many times a day when we are on St John.This reminds me of people who book a villa 6 months in advance and then 2 weeks before they go, they post on line ""Has anyone stayed at this villa. We are going in 2 weeks?""People do your homework, nobody is going to do it for you!!!!"
"""Where are we to go?""Disneyland is still the happiest place on Earth:http://vimeo.com/41787619"
"On the flip side of this, if you have been here, be diligent about using bug spray when you go home too just in case you did happen to get Chikungunya while you were here. Anywhere there are aedes mosquitoes, there is potential for Chikungunya transmission. I'm sorry you got sick, it sounds like you were one of the the unlucky people to have a pretty severe reaction. Of the people I know who have had it, their symptoms were gone after about a week of feeling sick. I've had Dengue fever once myself, and I can tell you that it was not fun at all. But for me, it ran it's course after 10 days and I was back to normal after that thank goodness. Yes, we have Chikungunya, and yes, we have Dengue, so taking necessary precautions is a must. Bug spray, keeping covered, staying off the beach at dawn and dusk, will all help make sure you don't get either virus. But I will also say that these two viruses are not enough to make the millions of people that live in the tropics and subtropics want to pick up and move someplace else, nor would those of us that live here don't think it's enough to tell the millions of you that visit us ever year to stay home."
"Add Florida to the list - cdc.gov/chikungunya/geo/united-states.htmlWe've missed out on Chikungunya/Dengue party in the seven weeks we've spent in the VI over the last 20 months, and the three weeks my daughter spent this summer. I blame bug spray, picking accommodations with a good breeze and avoiding mosquito prime time on the beach. Not even exposed. Funny, we didn't do anything differently from previous years. We even use insect repellent for mosquitos at home in Virginia. Crazy?If you're worried about Chikungunya exposure, Quest Diagnostics has an antibody test - questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/… . We had my daughter tested because of fever and joint pain. No Chikungunya or Dengue, zero exposure. I guess her three-week summer service camp spent doing mangrove reclamation and beach cleanup didn't expose her. She probably caught a virus on the flight home. Awful, she should have stayed in the VI.Cheers, RickGEdited: 5 years ago "
hi - thank you for this info. What brand/type of repellents do you use? I'm loading up on all options.
Bens Bug Spray is good either 100% Deet or 30% Deetdrugstore.com/bens-tick-and-insect-repellent…Pia
