Has anyone rented a flat from the OneFine STay company? Their website has some too good to be true places and I would love to hear from anyone who has actually dealt with this company.
telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/8366356…Looks legit to me.
"Yes, we rented two places from this company in London. The company is very professional and helpful. A representative met us at the rental on both occasions and walked us through the home and answered any questions we had. They also left some goodies for us in the kitchen on the two occasions. It's the rentals that are less than wonderful. The first was a studio in Nottinghill Gate. It was a nice location off the main thoroughfare and walking distance to a market and the tube. But the apartment was very cluttered with various knick-knacks and it was hard to find a place to put our luggage as there wasn't a closet. We used the couch in the room as a bed for our daughters so there wasn't any place else to sit. A large wooden dining table took up most of the room. There were laundry facilities and it was quiet.The second was in Marylebone. The apartment was beautifully decorated with fine wood and expensive decorations. We were asked to be carful about the furniture as many items were antiques. This apartment was again close to a market and the underground. But it was extremely noisy. We have lived in a city in the past but it felt like we were sleeping in the middle of Piccadilly Circus. We were kept up at night by sirens, horns and screaming neighbors that were so loud they could have been in our room. We understood the price for such a lavish place after trying to sleep at night. Unfortunately you pay for what you get. If I used this company again I would research the apartment more closely and ask a lot of questions before booking on line again."
We just booked through this company for an October rental. They are a fairly new company. They responded in a timely fashion and were pretty helpful in answering my emails. We set up a phone appointment for booking purposes and I asked many questions. I booked by phone with one of the owners who was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the company and London but was not really familiar with the specifics of the apartment I was interested in.I think this rental will work out fine for us and our kids. We've stayed in condos before in the USA but have never rented an apartment internationally. This company seemed superior to several others I contacted.

"We are considering renting an apartment they list in Marleybone. The one you let wouldn't happen to be the one called ""Bryanson Mews"" would it? Just trying to learn more about the outfit's reputation. Thanks"
"We rented the Carter Lane property which is in The City and worked out terrifically. The nearest tube is under renovation but we used St. Paul's which was pretty close (Occupy protestors camped here after we left). This flat is in the Financial area where there are some bars, restaurants, etc. Most but not all are closed on the weekend. There is a terrific Indian restaurant almost right next door. The owners left a nice list of nearby, suggested places to eat/drink/etc. The two bedrooms are downstairs and each had an ensuite bathroom; the second bedroom had a pull out queen sofa which was fine for my son and his wife. The half bathroom was also downstairs. My husband, son and daughter in law said the flat far exceeded their expectations. Be sure to read One Fine Stay's ""Home Truths"" for each property so you are not surprised."
"I just came back from a five day stay in one of their flats in Kensington (Queens Gate 2) - and it was first rate. I loved the location of the flat, it looked just like the photos and it was so nice to have the welcome goodies and toiletries there. The greeter was even early and they let me leave my bag in the flat while it was being cleaned. They even loan you an iPhone so you have a local phone number, plus GPS and internet - a lifesaver for me as I had meetings all over the city.Wouldn't hesitate to use them again, and recommend them highly."
Glad your stay in Kensington flat worked out well. We will definitely recommend One Fine Stay and will use them again when we are in London.
I recently booked an apartment (Earl's Court) with One Fine Stay and it was a great experience. The apartment was exactly as described and the representatives met me right on time (actually I was three hours late due to line at Heathrow and they met me at 11:30 pm with a smile). This was far better than any hotel I have stayed at in London. It felt like a home and it was really great.
"I didn't like this option. It isn't particularly cheap and despite paying a hefty price for what we were getting, in one breath being told to ""make ourselves at home"" were presenting with a rule book that is very much weighted in favour of the ""hosts"" then the ""guests"". Anyone would have thought they were letting us stay there for free. We were told the flat was a ""no shoes"" flat (cream carpets everywhere); all over the place there were red stickers on cupboards that were out of bounds... we then discovered that certain hangers were out of bounds. These stickers had the words ""your curiosity will incur a fee!"". Then, despite there being 3 of us we were given 2 keys (not very helpful when you have 3 people all wanting to do their own thing at different stages during the weekend. The place was like a shrine to the family and their clutter was everywhere, making it very difficult to ""be at home"". The company are indeed professional and legitimate, but if I go to London again, I will opt for a hotel because at least in a hotel you actually feel like a guest and not some unwanted intruder."
When they ask for $1000 security bond - does that mean they take the money OUT of your credit card and pay you back (that is if everything goes well) when you depart?
"Regarding a security deposit... yes, that would be the idea.Before you enter the agreement, read the terms yourself and check that the due dates as well as the terms for returning the deposit are clear and you feel comfortable with them.With well established agencies that are known by the long term members of this forum you should have nothing to worry about."
"I'll give some quick feedback on the company: I just used them August 24-27 in London (Westminster area, the Greycoat street location) and they were terrific. Ours was a smaller flat -- just 4 rooms connected by a foyer -- but it was still much larger than an equivalently priced hotel. The free use of an iPhone is a nice touch, and using the GoogleMaps feature on it proved to be quite handy. Service was just a phone call away, and service was simply first class. For me and my family -- it was a great experience, and we will use them again next time we're in London.Now if there was only a way to write a proper review on them on Tripadvisor..."
My family is thinking about staying at the Greycoat Street Apt. You liked the location? Did they have restaurants and the tube close by? Would it sleep a family of 3 comfortably? Any tips?
"We stayed at the One Fine Stay property on Weston Street this month and were quite disappointed. The first day, both the oven and the washer/dryer broke--the glass fell out of the oven door when we opened it, and the washer/dryer was still running six hours later without having actually washed the clothes. I managed to turn it to a setting where we got the door open, but amazingly (neither my husband nor myself, in a life's experience with UK washer/dryers, could understand how) the machine would NOT turn off! It continued whirring away (delightful at 4am) for the next three days before OFS got a repairman out to turn it off. We couldn't unplug it; it was in a small storage cupboard and absolutely surrounded by storage. We reported both appliances to OFS the first day (Sat), but it was Weds before the repairman came. He was able to fix the oven, but said the owners needed to buy a new washer/dryer (he said, due to the age of the broken one). OFS had our laundry done once during our stay. However, we were traveling with a baby and a toddler and one of the main reasons we booked with OFS was to have the ability to do washing. OFS also offered us, the night before we left, to go out to dinner up to £200 and send them the bill. Kind, but again, when traveling with two small children being told at 5pm you can take them out to a £200 dinner doesn't really work.I do not feel the flat was worth the £320 per night we paid for it. OFS was okay about being in touch while we were at the flat, but the minute we left, we were forgotten and three weeks and several emails and calls later, we are still trying to get compensation from OFS. We will not stay with One Fine Stay again. Our stay was unfortunately not fine!"
"We are in an OFS property in London as I write this and would choose this above other options next time we come.To give context, we are a family of 4, we are Brits living in Singapore and a couple of times a year we return to London. We prefer to stay close to Hampstead as we used to live there and have friends in the area. We have tried hotels but taking 2 rooms anywhere good is ruinously expensive - 11 days at the Marriot Regents Park last summer worked out around GBP5,000. We tried an independent self-catering place but it was dirty and full of builder's rubble, and the owner kept our deposit because she couldn't be bothered to collect the keys from us and claimed she had to change the locks (she didn't - we checked).In this context, OFS is good. The apartment we are in is good quality, everything works and it's spacious and well located. Yes there are too many cupboards full of the owners things, leaving almost no storage for us, and it lacks a tumble drier, but other than that, it's really pretty good and well-located for us. OFS provides a barrier between us and the potentially unscrupulous landlords, and that helps a lot. Plus a whole apartment with 3 beds and a spacious living room is much more pleasant than than 2 hotel rooms with no living area.The sad truth is that London is a very expensive city and a large proportion of the accommodation is run by people who want to rip you off. Whilst London has a number of great 5-star hotels (at a price), outside this most is disappointing. If you can find anything that is reasonably priced and run by honest people, you have lucked out. OFS at least operates a filter to remove poor properties like the one we suffered 18 months ago, and that's worth quite a bit."
We are looking at staying at an apartment in September - do you pay a deposit or the whole amount up front?
We love OfS and have used them a few times when in London. We'll always use them over a hotel for that home away from home experience.We always click on the 'Home Truths' section of each apartment and find the ones which are not generally lived in by the owner. This way you can use all the storage space for yourself and you don't feel like you're living in someone else's apartment. By doing it this way you get the real feeling of living in London like its your own property. Recently we stayed in an amazing apartment in Clapham which was close to all the sites and had a gorgeous park at the top of the road. There was a little pub near by which my husband ended up playing darts with the locals! It also had a washer/tumble dryer in a separate room. One thing we found to our horror in London was that most properties install their washing machines in the kitchen! So it was refreshing not to have to cook and wash ones socks at the same time!Enjoy!
Has anyone stayed in Darwin Court 3? It looks great for our needs but I am worried about the noise from the train. Any feedback is appreciated!
"Why would you want to have access to other peoples wardrobes and cupboards? You ARE staying in someone's home after all, and storage will harbour their belongings. However, each guest gets an empty closet and there is more space than a hotel room. In addition you have your kitchen etc. Of course the owner does not want to come home with marks all over the cream carpet! It might not be for everyone, but One Fine Stay has top class properties and amazing service."
"I offer my New York apartment to this company and I do live in a very nice building and have a designer apartment. I have never stayed at other people's houses, yet I know myself what I am offering on this website! My landlord - who lives in the penthouse that covers an entire floor!!! - offered this website to all the people in the building, therefore I would trust it!"
"I just returned from a trip in London and used OFS for my stay in the Bloomsbury area. Though the weather was uncharacteristically cold, we enjoyed our trip nonetheless thanks to the nice apt provided for under OFS. It is exactly as described and imaged on the website. Location was perfect for traveling via the underground tube system. The apt had good security and even a concierge service. OFS team was punctual and very responsive although we hardly had to call them. No issues with storage space (I had 6 luggages!) or even the red stickers stuck on some cupboards / drawers. As we are staying in someone else's home, it is only right to respect their privacy and look after it as if it was our home. In short, i will not hesitate to book from them again for apt stays."
Just stayed with an apartment through this company. They are an absolute farce. No terms and conditions stated prior to taking money then on arrival asked for a £1000 pound deposit for a £700 pound rental followed by requesting iPhoto I'd also not stated on booking. Further more 2 days later the £1000 has still not been returned . Avoid these people at all costs!
We used One Fine Stay on our trip to London from March 30 to April 7. We stayed at the Marlborough Court property and had a very positive experience. The company was very response and helpful and we were very comfortable in the property itself. I would highly recommend this option for your family's next stay in London.
"I am currently sitting in a flat we rented from One Fine Stay in London. The pros:-The iPhone is really nice - makes walking around the city easy and seamless-Having a larger space than a hotel is enjoyable, in addition to access to a washing machine, small kitchen, etc.-Really feels like we are ""living"" like the locals and less like a tourist.The cons:-The pictures DO NOT match what you actually arrive to. It was extremely disappointing when, after telling my husband we were staying at a high-end place in South Kensington, we arrived to a somewhat disheveled place. There is a large rug in the living room that is literally crumpled on the floor. We have tripped over it many times and there is absolutely no way to smooth it out as the large furniture is extremely heavy. Many of the homeowners items are stuffed into corners awkwardly. Most of the accessories shown in the picture (pictures on the wall, coffee table, kitchen chairs) have been removed and either replaced with something else or just left bare. The carpet is stained and appears dirty.-Given the amount of wealth within the Chelsea/South Kensington area, I have no doubts that this place is very expensive; however, it is disappointing to see how many simple things could give off such a better impression had they just been managed prior to our arrival. -For the amount of money spent, the quality is just not up to par. I am overall disappointed with our experience, and although there are some positives, not enough to have me leaving without a sour taste in my mouth. From here, we are traveling on to Belgium where we are staying in a luxury hotel and then to Amsterdam where we used another company and are staying in a home. It will be interesting to see how the experiences compare with both a large hotel and then another in-home experience. In the meantime, I would not recommend OFS unless you know people who have stayed in the one you are choosing and can vouch for it's authenticity in comparison to the pictures."
"Wow - I am glad to have found this thread. We are looking at booking New King's Road 4 in Fulham owing to the grand piano shown in the photo (this is important to us - can't find it in a hotel...). When I read some of the posts here, I became concerned about whether this apartment will really look as it does online. Has anyone seen this one in person?We have two choices - stay at the OFS New King's Road 4 in Fulham, or take up our previous room at the Marriott County Hall (top floor studio with terrace opening out onto the river and Big Ben view). We're not crazy about the chain hotels and the look of their rooms - so generic, and we like to have our own breakfast each am. etc. As noted, the piano is a real plus. However, we have had a bad experience with apartment rentals before - there is nothing worse than a dirty apartment, bugs, deceiving photos, and rude service - this sort of thing can ruin a trip.Of course Marriott seems to have these alarms that go off randomly in the middle of the night sending the patrons out into the lobby, but it is a small price if it means your kids can hear Big Ben every morning.Any feedback on OFS New King's Road would be super but if you can also comment on our choice between the OFS apartment and a stay at the Marriott again, it would be most appreciated.Thank you."
I'd be interested in which S. Ken flat you rented. We are also looking at flats on their site and don't want the one you described.Thanks
We stayed at Queens Gate Gardens 26 recently and unfortunately had some concerns that were never addressed. While the flat feels homey and the photos are accurate there are some serious maintenance issues that have gone unnoticed. We experienced a very cold and rainy week which their heaters could not keep up with. There were ants in multiple rooms and notified management within first 48 hrs of this problem and they stated they would take care of it and never did. Paint is peeling from many walls and the flat is in need of serious TLC. The kitchen refrigerator and freezer were not defrosted upon arrival we brought it to their attention and nothing was done. The only shower has a real problem with regulating the temperature it was either hot or cold and though there were instructions with its use this is very unsafe and potentially a liability. We were there for a family visit and despite the less than favorable conditions with this flat we were not going to let it ruin our stay. Management is well aware of our concerns and agreed with them but has not corrected this situation.

"See my comment I'm #28.Thanks,J"
IT HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH MY FIRST BOOKING WITH THEM! Highly disappointing in every respect ... The website did not show real representation of what you actually get with your rented apartment. We are paying high rates forECCLESTON SQUARE 3 PLIMLICO NO 80 . One fine stay took a photo of a square with number 72 which was on the opposite side of the actual apartment. The actual apartment is on a busy main road and as you go thru the front doors you are greeted with highly unluxurious setting . Filthy doormat outside one apartment on the ground floor. Going up the many flight of stairs the walls and windows are not up to mark for anyone who would be paying over £ 400 a night in a place such as this.the apartment inside is facing the main road hence noisy . The interiors Have not been updated or representative of a luxurious rental at all. Amenities are flimsy and the plug in the bath tub is faulty . I do believe a company such as ONE FINE STAY should be responsible in picking apartments that are representative of the price bracket a customer is paying. As a foreign person unaware of hidden truths in their website advertising luxurious accomodation thru photographs it is highly misleading. and unfair. I totally regret booking with them . I have complained on my first day and have stayed one night. I am now waiting for a fair responsible action from this companynOne fine Stay. I hope the company will seriously do something about this . M.lough
Here is the flat referred to in the above post: onefinestay.com/london/eccleston-square-3/
"We too have had a horrible experience with this company. From reading other reviews, it seems as if we are not alone in having great difficulty getting resolution to our concerns. We checked into New Kings Road 2 and in the morning started noticing the differences between the photos on the website and the actual apartment. Half of the artwork had been removed, leaving holes in the walls or in the case of the painting in the master bedroom, a metal bracket that was hip height and ready to gouge us if we weren't careful. There were cigarette butts on the balcony, fingernail clippings on the lampshade and loads of personal items filling up the second bedroom which we needed to use. The team at One Fine Stay really appeared to be responsive and try to deal with our concerns, but due to contract issues, we were unable to move to another property. Fine. We really did try to make the best of it. Then they said they would give us a credit for a future stay (which will likely never be used) and a small refund. Well, I'm still waiting for that refund and we stayed there 8 months ago! Continued contact with the company is getting me nowhere. On the plus side, I do think this company has a great concept, but as others have stated, they need to stay on top of things a bit more and really make sure they are delivering what is promised. They have extra services that we took advantage of like stocking our fridge and arranging for taxi service and those all went off without a hitch. It's a shame, as I would definitely have used used this company again and recommended them to others, but am now finished with them and will be looking elsewhere for accommodation in both London and New York."
"I am thinking of renting the One Fine Stay London apt called ""Queen Gate Mews"". One Fine Stay describes it as a former home of Madonna and Guy RItchie's. Has anyone stayed in this specific apartment and can give feedback?"
"We just rented from this company and had a wonderful experience! We had never rented an apartment before this and was unsure how this process was going to work out, to our surprise the process was great! The booking process was easy, they were quick to answer emails and the rep that meet us at the apartment was knowledgable and very helpful. The apartment we rented, Kingsley Mews 2 was exactly how it was portrayed on the pictures. It was charming, clean and exactly what we had hoped for. Some of the features that the company offered was a welcomed bonus that made our stay in London even better. Like the use of an iPhone that was loaded with recommendations, toiletries kits in all the bathrooms and little gifts of coffee, teas, and chocolates that came in handy during our stay! I can't say enough about this company, they were absolutely fantastic! We would definitely us them again."
"My recommendation would be to avoid- Owner of place will likely leave you not space to hang your cloths- You will received bogus claims of scratchs and other damages you ""caused"" and will be billed for them"
"Used one fine stay for London stay in July 2013 and was best apartment experience we have had and being a teenage family we have stayed in plenty. Apartment exactly as described, if not better! Yes they are not cheap and require a £1000 deposit, but when staying in £2M + apartments what do you expect. Could pay security on credit card as a hold and we were refunded in under 24 hours. Perfect for us as no forex charges. iPhone is great help and being private apartments found security excellent. Just wish they were in Paris when we were booking there!"
"We just recently used this organisation to stay in a quiet part of Chelsea. It was a small one-bedroom pied-a-terre, which suited us very well. At the back of a block in a quiet street, we were not bothered by noise. It was in walking distance of several Tube stations and had some good local places to eat nearby. We thought the price-per-night was good value and less than the equivalent of an impersonal hotel room. It did feel exactly as it was meant to be - living quietly and privately, nearly in the centre of London.The service from the One-Fine -Stay people didn't match this. The good part was being met on the doorstep by a representative, who helpfully did explain all that was needed. However, we were then given a mobile phone with supposedly unlimited calls, but which didn't work after the first day or so. We suspect it had run out of re-charge. The company was never available to talk directly with on the phone and we (fortunately) were able to communicate by email. We were then told that the phone company had only limited coverage in the London area - not sensible.But all-in-all - we were satisfied with this arrangement, that facilitated an interesting 10 days in London."
"nous avons loué un appartement près du British muséum à Londres . Nous avons été très déçus car l'appartement était situé en sous sol donc extrêmement sombre (alors que cela n'était absolument pas mentionné sur le site de"" one fine stay"".De plus il y avait des travaux au musée qui faisait un bruit épouvantable nous empêchant de nous mettre dans le tout petit jardinet. Les matelas des lits n'était pas confortables.Dans la cuisine , seulement 3 couteaux pour couverts.De plus le wifi marche que de temps en temps.Bref, un mauvais séjour vu le prix demandé. Trés cher rapport qualité/prix.Je ne recommande pas le site ""one fine stay""we rented an apartment near the British museum in London. We were very disappointed because the apartment was located in the basement extremely dark (although it was definitely not mentioned on the site ""one fine stay."" And there was work at the museum which made ​​a noise terrible preventing us to put ourselves in the tiny garden. The cot mattress was not comfortable.In the kitchen, only three knives covered.More wifi works only occasionally.In short, a bad stay for the price asked. Very bad quality / price ratio.I do not recommend the site ""one fine stay""Edited: 7 years ago "
"We are about to go stay one week in London at a place they/we chose together. 19 hours after our money was accepted (confirmed) I tried to cancel, and choose a different, area, one my friends had first suggested. Initially, we had been booked in a different area, but the owner then declined access (.24 hours later.)We travel a lot, and will never use One Fine Stay, again.I think it is more than fair to be able to cancel 19 hours ( after the credit card went through). Especially since we would re-book with them.I think OFS should have at least tried, to negotiate with the owners of the flat*The manager who called me back (19 hours was middle of the night there), was very nice. Angela? I forget** We will never use them again, and pay more attention to everything (areas and rules), next time."
"Just got back from London and rented a 2 bed apartment from them at 56 Quaker Street, Shoreditch. The apartment was advertised as 2 bedroom, open plan and the pictures shown looked great. When we arrived, the actual living area was tiny and the owner had ""red tape"" all over the place, meaning we were not allowed access to those areas. The wardrobe and chest of drawers in the second bedroom were taped, leaving nowhere to put any clothes and the kitchen cupboards were full of his stuff, leaving no room to do any cooking of our own. Even the fridge drawers were ""red taped"". Ridiculous for over 3000 pounds for 2 weeks! The company itself was pleasant enough, but this property was definitely not value for money, or what we expected from their pictures on the internet. Investigate thoroughly and ask questions before booking"
I recently rented a flat in London from them and it was excellent. This was my second time with One Fine Stay and i have to say that the flats they have a very good and in great locations. I definitely prefer this to a hotel.
"Hi All,I'm thinking about renting a loft in NYC via One Fine Stay (OFS). Has anyone dealt with One Fine Stay in New York??? How was it? Did all go as you expected? Thanks in advance for your feedback as most info on TripAdvisor seems to relate to OFS's operations in London.Edited: 7 years ago "
Thanks in advance for your feedback as most info on TripAdvisor seems to relate to OFS's operations in London.------------------------Try posting on the NYC forum. Vacation sub- lets are illegal in NYC though so whether OFS or not you should get more info there.Edited: 7 years ago 
"As the owner of this property, I rather object to the complaints made.Any one who knows Eccleston Square would know that all of the sides of it contain identical properties, it is immaterial that no 72 was photographed from the outside rather than number 2 or 24. So what?The property is on the second floor and the Home Truths section of the website highlights that. Almost every property in London is on a ""busy"" road. Buckingham Palace Rd, which is close is busier and has amongst others Buckingham Palace on it. Park Lane is busier and has some pretty smart hotels on it. Knightsbridge has No 1 London on it and is even busier, so what? If you don't like traffic stay in the country like I do.The people who own the ground floor apartment have put a door mat outside their front door. It is probably not spotless because of it's function. I have not inspected it but do not recall it being filthy.. It is a door mat for goodness sake.The common parts are actually in a very good state but have not been redecorated for two years. In my opinion they do not need redecorating today.The interiors were completely redecorated to a very high standard three months before this booking and are as immaculate as the photographs of the property show. Immaculate!The amenities are not flimsy, they almost brand new and very expensive. The faulty bath plug was fixed by unscrewing it by half a centimetre. This is the sort of thing that happens with even the best bath plugs."
Dealing with this company has driven me crazy. Their customer service and communication has been horrible.
"I agree 100%! We just returned from a stay on Gowan Ave in London, OFS was terrific but the ""hosts"" were something else! Pictures of themselves everywhere, I mean every room including the bathrooms and a gigantic life size portrait over the master bed, it was uncomfortable and creepy, like they were watching our every move. The red stickers are on almost everything as well. After our stay OFS contacted us with a list of ""damages"" that the hosts provided. They claimed we lost a parking permit (we did not have a car during our stay) claimed we broke the cooker and a door hinge, never happened! And they wanted compensation for all this plus the crumbs left in a drawer. Are these people serious? Its hosts like this that lose business for OFS. Never again!"
"We rented the Queens Gate Mews flat and loved it. It is on a lovely Mews walking distance from the museums in South Kensington. Bathrooms are lovely. Bedrooms are comfortable. Open living space on the first floor. It was very convenient to have an iphone to use for the week. The only negative was the pub across the street, which was loud until 11 pm, but this was listed under the Home Truths; it was very tolerable. I would rent this flat again and would not hesitate to rent from One Fine Stay again."
"We are interested in the Old Compton Street, Soho, London apartment and would like feedback if anyone has stayed there."
"We have never stayed, but have rented our house out through them. They are exceptional at customer service and screen the homes that they accept very carefully - they turn many people down."
"Potential hosts be warned. We have had a terrible experience with these people. Smooth sales pitch but awful customer (host) service. Their contractors damaged our house, took ages to address the issue and, having agreed to pay for repairs, they are now refusing to make payment.It isn't worth it - use another company if the idea appeals - they are more focussed on their margins than keeping their promises......"
"I booked a flat for our recent trip to London. I was a bit dissapointed in the service I received as the address was wrong on their booking confrimation that cost us a $70.00 cab ride (from Victoria Station to South Kenningston Station) I mentioned twice in my emails to them that I would not have a phone in London so to email me with any challenges. We were right on time and they were no where to be found. I emailed several times and no one responded. I finally asked a local store owner if I could use their phone. Thank goodness for that or we'd still be on the street. The rep had been in the apartment, which I had rang the bell and got nothing. She was so confused because she tried to call me several times to find out where I was. I shared I was surprised by that because I stated twice, when I booked the flat and when I sent my follow up information, that I would NOT have access to a phone. The flat was in a perfect location and what we were looking for. (except the couch had a very large rip on the arm). The only thing lacking is attention to details by their operations team."
"Even given the fact that you may have spent some time searching for the property with the meter running, there is no way a taxi journey from Victoria to South Kensington would cost $70 (£43 at current conversion rates) and not just because we use the pound in the UK."
"I can understand your skepticism. Because we were not given the full address, the driver took us the general location and then we drove around the area looking for the specific flat. We drove for over 30 minutes. We pulled over at one point to where he reviewed books on certain addresses. He was lovely and let us use his cell phone to call the number on the official confirmation, but the number didn't work with the way it was written. Which he even tried. So with the of the ride and how he really tried to help us, I tipped him 15 pounds. We were so relieved to have finally found the flat (behind a construction wall no less). I would recommend the company, the idea and inventory is fantastic, this is a just a reminder to pay attention to the details. Honestly, it's not about the money (we spent way more than $70 on other things), it's just that it should not have been as frustrating as it was to get to where we needed to be on the first day of our vacation."
Thanks for the explanation although I am still confused. £70 or $70? There is a large difference!
"Give Serviced Apartments a try. You get an entire property (with no owners clutter). All you have to do is go food shopping. All utensils, cutlery, crockery etc are in the apartment (inc towels). A common theme causing a problem seems to be that you are staying in someone elses home and therefore there are rules laid down by the owner. You won't be disappointed with a serviced apartment"
"Hello- I was just reading your comments about renting a flat vrs a hotel and I am curious what you ended up doing and how it turned out ? We are a family of 4 hoping to travel to London next summer and I am very torn between an apt rental or hotel. I keep going back and forth but this thread has so many negatives about apt rentals that it is scaring me! Your hotel choice sounded pretty cool too. My hubby didn't really want to stay at a 'marriott' or 'holiday inn' type of hotel, but rather a traditional British hotel; but when i researched the cost it was just crazy when you can get all the space an apt offers. But at least w a hotel you know what you are getting (pretty much). Any advice or help would be great!!!"
"Has anyone stayed at the Coolhurst Road Highgate, with One Fine Choice? We are about to book there and was wondering if anyone has any helpful insight. Thank you."
"we're thinking about it too, and the flat says it's for 4 people, but we may have a fifth child joining, does any one know if that would be a problem for them if they found out..."
"Emma,You could try e-mailing them but it could easily invalidate insurance (yours or theirs) so please don't try to sneak the extra child in."
I would definitely advise if another child does join you as the price difference will be minimal if at all and at least you would knwow everything's above board.
"Just tried booking a place with these folks in Paris......in summary a NIGHTMARE...after 5 days of emails & phoned alls, they booked the wrong place, which i cancelled....it gets better they still charged my credit card for the ~2,500 euros.Now I am fighting to get my money back.Grant."
"We travel often and will always rent a private home , condo or apartment over a hotel when possible, Because of our experience doing the research i.e. reading reviews, comparing sites, employing google earth for location and most important communication with the owners of potential properties we have always been pleased with our choices . Until we rented a flat in London for a 5 night stay from ONEFINESTAY. It did not go well and we take some responsibility because from the start of the booking process the signs were there, To begin we choose an apartment that was available for our dates and it was confirmed by ONEFINESTAY . They charged our credit card and then 2 days later informed us the apartment was no longer available. [This is where we should have stopped doing business with ONEFINESTAY] Instead we choose a new apartment from a list provided by ONEFINESTAY. We did settle on a new flat and arrived in London from Los Angeles to find an apartment that looked nothing like the pictures found on ONEFINESTAY site and as we entered the apartment it reeked of cigarette smoke. We informed ONEFINESTAY we would not stay and spent the next 4 hours outside in the cold arguing with ONEFINESTAY[ at one point they wanted to bring in carpet cleaners !] . They finally agreed to move us to a new flat. but that was only available for 2 nights and we would have to move again. This flat was so small you have to walk through the shower to get to the toilet[ and although it was less expensive rental they tried to charged us the higher rate of the smoke flat] So the next day was spent along with seeing the sites trying to figure out where we would go to finish up our stay. ONEFINESTAY sent us emails of potential apartments but all were over overpriced and we had gotten a bit smarter when it came to dealing with ONEFINESTAY. We stood our ground and finally ONEFINESTAY offered an apartment that was acceptable . The third apartment was in a good area , clean and nicely furnished but there is red tape on closets and drawers , red tape everywhere. The television in the bedroom did not work. At this point we are very concerned about our security deposit and call ONEFINESTAY about the television and opening a red tape closet by mistake. We left London spending more time sorting out our stay with ONEFINESTAY, then enjoying the cityThe pictures of each of the 3 flats we saw were photographed to enhance the apartments and because of this each apartment was a disappointment. When that happens the consumer will lose all confidence in a site.The scary red tape is overbearing and stupid.Each apartment was over priced based on the dozens of vacation rentals we have stayed in.I would say whenever possible deal with the owner of the vacation rental you are interested in. Also don't be tricked as I felt we were by glossy PR . ONEFINESTAY has had placement in rmajor publications and to assume this means a good product is a mistake.These sites have worked for us for years VRBO , HOMEAWAY and our favorite BOUTIQUE HOMES.Finally this site TRIPADVISOR has been huge to help us make good choices because the reviews come from honest travelers excited about the planning and sharing of new adventures.... next stop Mexico !!!"
They also require 100% payment on booking which totally puts me off.
My family is interested in renting the large 5-6 bedroom home in Canonbury Park South. The street looks to be named Irving Mews off of Alwyne Road. Does anyone know anything about this property?
Reported on the BBC today that Westminster City Council are considering taking action against some property owners in this system on grounds of breach of planning regulations.....
"One fine stay is a nightmare. Stay away! After one phone call (yes, it is available) and 9 days I finally got a reply by mail. It was available, but price was up 27%.After 11 days I got contra. It was not available. Sent a mail where I expressed my discontent. Got a reply saying they were sorry, but they could find something else, but to a considerable higher price.This is not a company giving apartments away. It is probably market price, but you do pay quite a bit for an apartment and I prefer that it comes with a service minded employee. Go elsewhere!"
I have….
"Yes I have just left London and I have stayed with them, I saw the pictures and it was amazing but we were shocked that we are staying in a basement, in addition there 35% commission fees extra which they will not tell you. All this we'll come after you book and pay."

"I've used them once for a 3 night stay near Olympia, I was very impressed. There are restrictions, you are staying in someone's home, not an aparthotel, so you have to be prepared for that - but I felt it was good value and a very good service. Would just recommend looking for reviews on the actual property you chose as they are bound to vary.One point of note is that nightly rates tend to come down a lot as you stay longer. It's very good value for 3 nights+, maybe less so for a one night stay."
"Hi there, I was just wondering, did you stay in the apartment on Sinclair Rd near Olympia station? We have booked there for 3 nights in June and I am curious how it is. Thanks!"
"Has anyone stayed in Evelyn Gardens II. The pictures look great, but after reading some of the disappointing review of other units, I'm a bit concerned."
"Terrible customer service. I had to move out after they failed to fix the only bathroom in the place! They failed to return calls, emails and texts. We were left homeless in London! They just didn't care - and were utterly useless - I have almost never experienced such terrible ""service"" - a bunch of children could do better.They didn't even meet us at the house and left us standing there - ""Oh, did the office not ring?""Non functioning toilet! ""We'll get a plumber for tomorrow"", I even had to say - ""Like, where do I pee? Out the window?"".Never be back - plus my account with them shows other peoples bookings - oops - even the booking system is flawed!"
"William Morris Way, Fulham EnglandJune 10 through June 15 2014I was disappointed with the condition of the apartment but especially disappointed with the One Fine Stay management teamOur greete rwas pleasant young lady who’s main function appears to be taking a photo of your credit card for damage deposit. To most inquires her response was “I’ll check on that and someone will call you”. She did, however, point out the leaking cold water faucet in the kitchen which when turned on sprays water all over. “someone will fix that tomorrow”. When we left 5 days later it was still leaking! The flat is on the 8th floor and the view o f the Thames is wonderful, especially at night. Unfortunately the rest of the place did not measure up. The place was dirty, they might want to review whom ever they employ to do the cleaning.The carpet in the front sitting area has an 8 inch black circular stain ¼ of an inch high, looks like some kind of dried food ! Gross. Window shade in bath was broken, seal on shower/bath glass rotted non functional.My point is any casual inspection would see these things. Very low standards for an upscale rental. we had to park our car on the street ! 20 pounds a day in coins! I must tell you in comparison, our accommodations in Bath, Cardiff, and Dublin were wonderful, all we could ask for. As for London, we loved it, enjoyed it all. One fine stay, however, just wasn’t part of it."
"We rented a house in West Kensington from One Fine Stay (OFS) in early July. We have been extremely disappointed with the standard of customer service from OFS particularly given the very high cost that we paid for our stay. We will not rent another property from this company.When we arrived at the house we noticed that there was scaffolding installed at the front and rear of the property next door, it became clear that there was major renovation work in progress. Each day we were at the house there was constant construction noise coming from next door (all houses in the street were terraced) and workmen outside being loud. While this would be a nuisance to most people, we also have 3 young children and the smallest one sleeps during the day. The noise in her bedroom was incredible (drilling, hammering, sawing, etc) and caused some issues particularly as children had just arrived from long flight overseas. We avoided being in the house during the day when children were not sleeping.We tried to contact OFS to discuss the situation but despite repeated attempts to call the assistance numbers provided we never once got hold of anyone. We also tried the person who met us on the first day, their phone went straight to message bank. The only way we could contact anyone from the company was to call the new bookings line which was answered straight away, the person on the other end of the phone said they would get someone to call back but no-one ever contacted us despite repeated attempts. The only way we got to talk to someone is on the last day when the handover person knocked on the door 5 mins before check out time and we pointed out to them that we had requested a late check-out in writing. We then got a call from a manager at OFS to say that other guests were about to arrive and they had not seen our late check out request until now. When we got someone from OFS on the phone we explained how unhappy we were that the website said nothing about construction work next door otherwise we would never have booked the house. The manager agreed that we should be entitled to an apology and a refund on the rental rate. It is now 4 weeks since we left the house and we have heard nothing from OFS despite sending e-mails to ask on status of our complaint. I now don't expect to get any response.Further to above, despite requesting a late check-out at 12pm, we had the awkward situation where the next guests arrived at 11am with all their bags and we were not ready to leave. Fortunately the other guests were very nice and agreed to dump their bags and come back later, the representative from OFS did not seem to be too interested in this issue (I suspect he is used to things like this happening).We were also advised on the day before we arrived that the clothes dryer was broken, we asked that this be fixed during our stay as 5 people (including 3 kids) can generate a lot of washing in a short time. The dryer was not fixed and OFS did not follow this up during our stay. Fortunately we found a laundromat within walking distance of the house.In summary OFS has access to some interesting properties (London and elsewhere) but they are expensive and customer service is awful. Also (as advertised) you are staying in someone's house so expect some wear and tear and restrictions on which parts of the house and facilities you can use."
"We had been considering renting an apartment in London next summer for a couple of weeks via One Fine Stay. The consistent and numerous posts spread over a period of years on this thread have given me a very hefty moment of pause. Other than going on VRBO, are there other options in London that one can recommend? I like the idea of renting through a company in a city like London, so that any potential concerns during the stay can be addressed."
This list compiled by TALF regular Tex Scott has many legit/reputable providers:https:/…Do ask about any particular properties you find interesting. Locals may be able to give you some general pros and cons.
"Kenway Road, Earl's Court July 22 - August 5Like a lot of reviews, we had issues with OFS customer service. Lots of promises, but really bad follow through. We did a lot of chasing down for answers, requests for repairs etc. The house itself I'd recommend with a couple of caveats. It's in a great location, so convenient for transportation, food stores, restaurants. Although a two minute walk from the tube, it's on a quietish side street. The house comfortably housed six of us. My husband and I, my elderly parents and our two children (15 and 6) with lots of room to spread out. We had outdoor space. Having a iPhone to use was great and v welcome. I initially wrote a long list of things that were wrong but I deleted it and will say this, the house was dirty and really cluttered. Cleaning was surface at best and in only some areas. Some furnishings were in really rough shape, just not what I expected for the $$ we spent. The homeowners left us we barely any storage, out of 11 closets, only two were availabe to us. In one bedroom with no hanging space, the only drawers were a chest of drawers and a desk, none of which were available to us. OFS gave us a pop up wardrobe. Like other reviewers, I felt the HO, felt that they were doing us a favor by letting us stay. Not everything pictured on site was in the house, only a big deal because it didn't leave us with enough seating in lounge/living room OFS needs better quality control and a hand-off to the next renter, procedure. We had no hot water for two days. The HO turned it off and didn't tell us or OFS. We had no house manual and the hot water heater was in a red tagged closet. It took most of a day of phone calls to locate it and get it working. We were left with a third of the fridge, half of the freezer and one short shelf in the pantry to use for two weeks. The rest had the HO's food and on closer inspection lots of their stuff was out of date, two yr old jar of open anchovies anyone, 2006 strawberry jam with added mold, yuck! The HO's personal assistant came into the house with her own key (thx for the heads up) and she told us the HOs left three days before we arrived so it was their stuff. The HO didn't leave us any kind of house manual. No information about how to use any appliance. Of course we eventually figured most things out, but I felt it was rude not to give us even a cursory guide. Then one of the toilets constantly ran, was seen by a plumber but needed an extensive repair. So nothing more was done, it just ran. And so it goes on. We were sick of calling them to report a problem, have them make promises, call them back again because nothing was done etc etc. great idea, but they need better follow through and training."
"Hi, An update on this post. A few days after I left these comments, OFS contacted us to advise that they will refund a part of our stay to compensate for the inconvenience. I have now received a refund to my credit card (~18% of total cost of accommodation) and GBP 200 credit towards any future stay. We also received an apology for the the poor customer service we received."
"We rented a nice place in Chelsea. However, the flat really needed cleaning, the hot water didn't work for two days and the dryer didn't work. I reported the issues to Onefinestay but they didn't fix any of the problems. I would not rent from them again"
"Update on 67 Kenway Road review. OFS were v. apoligetic about our complaints at the end of our stay and gave us a two night refund for our stay, which we appreciated. I also finally finished the online questionnaire they gave us which prompted another call from them with an offer for a substantial credit towards another stay within the next 12 months. we'll do a lot more research on the specific rental, but we are tempted to use them again."
"I would say from my experience.. which I will dub ""One Fine Disaster"" the apartment I rented had construction going on. Granted they discounted the stay 40 percent.. but it seems that the construction had been going on for 2 months and no one check the apartment until the morning of my arrival. An hour before I arrived I got this news. Needless to say it went down hill from they.. The staff is nice and accommodating but things like the stove, stereo system , trash were not explained until I requested. It seems far too hands off to ask for the premium prices.. I would go air b n d , where you deal with the owner directly ."
I will add that the apartment was beautiful but the company was not very good.
I had the same experience and had I read this would of saved me a mirgrane or two
"We had a difficult experience with One Fine Stay that left a sour taste in our mouths after our holiday. I would be careful with One Fine Stay if you're from abroad or out of town. When we moved out of the apartment we had stayed in London, the company refused to return our deposit sending us photographs of the damage we had supposedly done to the windows and the bathroom in the apartment we had stayed in. The letter claimed that these damages do occur and they were afraid they couldn't return our deposit. It was a letter from our lawyers that finally resolved the issue. We were also quite willing to meet their staff at the apartment to inspect the said damage because we were still in London. Fortunately for us they had inadvertently sent us pictures of a damage from another apartment. Not the one we stayed in. Please be very careful with One Fine Stay."
"Top service. I've stayed in a OneFineStay home several times now, occasionally with the family, occasionally on business. They have a wide range of homes to cater for different needs from small, modern, inner-city apartments to huge, 10-bedroom houses near the beautiful parks of Richmond. The costs vary and are often dependent on location, space & features, but you always receive a whole range of extras that you don't get with other holiday home's. All your hotel-style complimentary's are provided, toiletries, towels etc, but you also get some kitchen essentials & a gift pack with things like luxury chocolates & coffee. To top it off, you get an iphone which is setup with all kinds of helpful tips & apps."
"We just finished a week long rental with Onefinestay.com and I was disappointed with their service. While the apartment - St. Johns Street II - was spectacular, unfortunately the service from onefinestay was not. At a cost of a little over $3,000 for the week, I think I could have done better using VRBO or AirBnB. The apartment was advertised as coming with a garage parking spot in the building. For this reason alone, I decided I might as well rent a car to take us from and to the airport. The car rental wasn't expensive and the garage spot would ensure that when not used, the car could be easily stored off the street. I emailed onefinestay a month before our trip to confirm that the space would be available to us. I received confirmation a couple of days later that it would be. When we arrived at the apartment to meet our ""greeter"" and go over the details of the apartment, she told us she couldn't find the remote for the garage door. Understandably, these things can happen. She promised she would call the owner, try to locate it and get back to us before our 4pm official check-in time. When we arrived back at the apartment at 4pm there were another two women at the apartment and they were wrapping up the cleaning of the apartment. I asked about the remote for the garage and they said they didn't know anything about it. We called onefinestay again, and were told the garage remote could not be found. They texted us the addresses of two parking lots we could park the car in overnight. We were told that they would reimburse for any parking costs. However both garages were a good fifteen minute walk from the apartment. Not exactly an ideal solution. Nonetheless we parked it in one of the garages. Having heard nothing from onefinestay from Sunday until Thursday, I decided to call again and see if there was any progress on locating the garage remote. We were told the owner was mailing the remote to them. They delivered the remote to the apartment later on Thursday afternoon. The cost of parking the car in the remote garage for the four days was over 100 pounds. We checked out of the apartment on Sunday and returned to the U.S. It is now Wednesday evening. Despite two emails, we have yet to be told how we will be reimbursed for the additional parking expenses. I feel they should make an offer of some additional compensation, as the parking provided was much less convenient than the parking arrangement we were promised. The loss of a garage remote is entirely understandable. What is unacceptable - especially from a company charging a premium for their services - is the lack of follow-up, follow-through and general responsiveness. I would not recommend onefinestay.com to anyone looking for a short-term vacation rental."
Just wait for the rant when Edin receives the Congestion Charge fines from his car rental company!
"I rented from Onefinestay thinking I was going a little upscale. Maybe this was bad luck but it also shows that this company does not really do a thorough check of the properties rented. The front door of our property opened with a LOT of difficulty , the chap who met us fiddled with the lock for several minutes. We could not do it . The chap who received us was very pleasant, called the office and we were told that it would be fixed in four hours. In the meanwhile the second door was left open . Given that there was another front door there was no security problem but there was an open postal slit through which cold wind blasted in freezing the whole place. After many phone calls the lock was fixed 10 hours later! My second problem was that there was a lot of used opened food left behind. The freezer was FULL with the previous guests food. I found this repulsive and unhygienic. The company was pleasant and gave us a discount but of course, I would have preferred an uneventful holiday rather than waste a whole day waiting for the door to be fixed. The flat itself was nice and the location superb. My disappointment is with the company, their lack of previous due diligence on the door and their cleaning policy of not cleaning out old food."
How strange ! I feel better. I thought I was the only one with problems and therefore overly fussy. But am sorry that you had an awful time . Is it possible they do not like people from DC ?Edited: 5 years ago 
"I have mixed feelings about One Fine Stay. They called us the evening before we were supposed to arrive and changed our booking because the house supposedly had mice. So we were relocated to a house on Ladbroke Rd. It was a skinny six-story house, not enough bedrooms, and not within walking distance to where we wanted to be. We didn't have time to research the house and discover that the toilet was in the master bedroom with only a see-through glass partition. The same for the shower. The same for another bedroom. So effectively if you wanted to have privacy in the bathroom you had to kick everyone out of the rooms. Seriously? Also, the dishwasher didn't work. I think the house was way overpriced. So I'm not a satisfied customer and won't be using them again. Maybe they really were trying to be accommodating. Maybe not."
"I too have mixed feeling about onefinestay's service offering. The main issue is, it is very difficult to offer a standard and consistent service across all their properties. Though the 'unhotel' concept is good long term prospects of such service-centered, yet, separated-from-the-original property vendor business model is yet to be proven in my opinion."
"My family and I rented a property for 31 nights in London, we chose ""Inverness Terrace"" in Bayswater. Since we arrived we found many faults in the property that should have been seen before renting out the property. Small details like dirty and very used pots and pans, as lack of glasses or very low quality of cutlery. The size of the mattresses was bigger than the size of the actual bed, no night table in the master bedroom, quality of the sofas was terrible (smelly, ragged cushions) and the ""big L shaped sofa"" was actually a series of small personal sofas put together so they were constantly floating around. The coffee machine was not working, there was no Wii or Apple TV as offered, the dining room table was very small and could not fit the 6 chairs (besides it was a floating glass that was constantly moving around being very dangerous, and other small issues. OFS was very attentive and nice. Priscila is amazing and gave us a constant service, replaced the pots and pans, cutlery etc. The big problem came when one night, in the middle of freezing January, there was a problem and the electricity went out in the flat (8 pm), which meant no heating, hot water or cooking, TV, internet, etc. After 45 mins somebody came and told me there was an overcharge of electricity due to the dryer and taught me how to put the fuse up again. It happened 3 more times until I couldn't get it up anymore. I called and called and besides apologizing, they told me they couldnt get anybody until next day and offered to send me some blankets ! I thought that was crazy and made a whole complain. Anyway we spent the night there (and saw a miss call in the phone at 2 am asking us if we wanted to be moved to a hotel)....too late. We were asleep in this Igloo style flat. The next day somebody came a mid day and the thing was the dryer and they needed to change it but that couldn't be before the next 10 days !! So my holidays were spent overlooking for a house that is not mine and doing my laundry in the laundry, which is one of the reasons why I don't go to a hotel. To make the story short, At the end they realised it was too much (specially considering we still had 2 more weeks ahead) so they changed us to a beautiful flat in Ebury Street, Belgravia. Everything great until I went to the master bedroom bathroom and saw the shower....it is blocked !!! obviously somebody was working on it because it is even into pieces....is this a joke ? the TV in the bedroom is not working also, but minor detail. They sent a contractor and apparently they have to do a big job so tomorrow we will have people working expecting them to arrive between 8 am to 1 pm. The same withe the TV. So, mixed feelings. Their service is very attentive and I could never thank Priscilla enough for all her efforts towards us....but honestly, an openly blocked shower in a flat when we are moved from the previous one for problems ? I think they need to do a proper assessment of the homes before renting them out and before giving them to people. In spite of all these issues, I would work with them again, but only because of Priscilla's service and because of all her effort to please us. This flat is lovely....just the problem with the shower and TV."
"HI, thinking about renting the Princedale Road V home. Any ideas about this Holland Park house?"
"Just returned from a stay at a One Fine Stay property in Covent Garden. It was lovely, very convenient to all attractions but we had one HUGE disaster: The maids stole or threw away our daughter's epilepsy meds! We had to waste a morning scrambling to get an appointment with a UK doc to get him to write out a new prescription and then go to a pharmacy to get it filled. The ordeal cost 300 pounds. OFS says they will reimburse, though."
"Yes, we rented a townhouse in mid March, 2015 in Covent Garden for us, my daughter and her husband and two grandchildren. It was a superb location with 3 bedrooms, 3 baths. Comfortable and clean. But do read home truths which pointed out that house had lots of steps and that was true. However, staff was responsive when we had any issues regarding appliances, hot water, etc. . Having a local iPhone supplied was a definite plus showing restaurants, and info about the house.To get in early after a long flight from U.S. cost us another $400 but worth it to not have to wait until 4 pm. We had a lot of privacy and local Tesco was down the block.Edited: 5 years ago "
"We booked a flat off Fulham Road with One Fine Stay for three people, close to South Kensington. While the booking itself went smoothly a number of frustrating issues arose during our stay. Firstly while the Check In process was done by two very friendly greeters, soon after they left it was evident there were issues with the flat. These included the freezer being completely frosted over, rendering it impossible to open any drawers, as well as the lack of a bin and bin bags and instructions on where to actually take the rubbish. We therefore had to leave rubbish lying in kitchen in plastic bags. We were given an iPhone and number to call regarding such issues but after calling One Fine Stay it took 30 hours for someone to come look at the freezer, by which point we had already defrosted it ourselves. In regards to the bins despite us asking for one no one brought us one or advised on where to take the rubbish.We then also had issues with the upstairs neighbours. While of course it is understandable that these external factors cannot be controlled by One Fine Stay, or it is difficult to do so, we did ask them for help with talking to the neighbours or finding us new accommodation as the neighbours (despite our talking with them) played music all day so loudly that our ceiling was vibrating. We were repeatedly told by One Fine Stay that someone will be with us “within the hour” or at a specific time. These were not met and we waited, while the ceiling vibrated, for nearly 6 hours since the original time we were told they would come help us out. It was also incredibly frustrating calling the service line and having to deal with different employees each time to whom we had to explain the situation over and over again. These different people would also constantly give us different answers, making it very overwhelming and wasting a lot of our stay on the phone trying to figure out when and if someone who promised to help us out would come. We were eventually moved to another house in Notting Hill to get away from the noisy neighbours. Upon our arrival the greeter told us he would provide us with a second set of keys the next day. We were then confirmed this by a further two people that same day. As anyone can imagine it is difficult when you have three people staying at a house to just have one key in use when you want to organize different activities for yourself. So the next morning we called to enquire about the second key and when it would arrive. We were told very bluntly that they could not provide us with one. We then spent over two hours on the phone trying to figure out why we were being given conflicting information about keys and why in the previous flat were we given two keys and how we could cope with just one for three people. This was incredibly frustrating and we spent a lot of our time trying to get ahold of the One Fine Stay people who kept giving us conflicting information and making us wait around for them to reply or show up despite being given a set time. To conclude this was one unpleasant stay, rather than the fine stay that was promised."
"Yes, my wife and I just got back from London....see my comments below....Sirs, I'm just back home from London. We reserved five nights at your property at Cornwall Gardens 53A. May 17th to May 22. I want to give you an opportunity to address several issues we had during our stay.We were very dissapointed in the property in general....here's some specific observations.The carpet throughout the property is very old and somewhat worn.The large white lamp in the bedroom has a broken shade and does not work.Many of the push button switches on the wall don't work, leaving many areas of the property very dark.There are no electrical outlets in either bathroom making it very difficult to use hair dryers.The small hall bath has no light over the sink. Very hard to see when I was shaving. Also no shower....There is no TV in the bedroom. Not acceptable.There is no TV in the living room. Not acceptable.The only TV in the property is a tiny TV in the corner of the breakfast nook and the only chairs to use are very uncomfortable making it impossible to relax and catch up on the local and world news. NOT ACCEPTABLE.THE PROPERTY SITS ON TOP OF THE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY AND VIBRATES EVERYTIME A TRAIN GOES BY......TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A PROPERTY RENTED FOR THIS MUCH MONEY.Please let me know how you want to resolve this situation. This property should not be listed on your website or any website offering upper tier residential rental property...Thank you for your attention to this matter."
"We just completed a rental booked through One Fine Stay. While the sales staff was very responsive and helpful, we found that the company's response to problems was inadequate and, on one occasion, snotty. We cannot recommend using One Fine Stay. Our overall sense is that we were not in good hands.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Just arrived at our London flat. Very small but big surprise was scaffolding and workmen all over the building !They emailed me yesterday to say that ' it had just come to their attention ' that work was going on but fellow who let us in said 'oh, this scaffolding has been here for months '! I guess he didn't get the memo on how to deceive . I don't trust these people one bit."

"I recently stayed in paris. Bad experience. Toilet wasn't working, electricity went out and the pictures were not representative of the dwelling. place should not have been used as a rental."
my experience in london was also the same. Rent from Paris Perfect if you go again. Top notch service and their apartments are wonderful and everything is as stated and more!!
"Ugh, and to think I had this company originally on my list of ""good"" agencies. I will stay far, far away when booking my next flat, for sure. Thanks to everyone for posting your experiences. You help a lot of people from incurring similar."
"Hi,We stayed at an apartment from One Fine Stay is Paris. It all seems wonderful on their website but don't be fooled. The refrigerator, stove, wifi, plugs did not work. The fridge was not sealing properly so it was not cooling properly. The stove wasn't working, the wifi was going in and out constantly, the plugs did not work with our travel approved appliances even though we had a converter. It was my birthday weekend and we had to leave that night to stay in a hotel because it was so bad. We were only there for 4 nights I did not want to have the aggravation or wasted time of dealing with all these problems. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Have you noticed they dont allow reviews on their site?? Why is that? It's because they are not a good stand up company. so sad that there are such terrible companies out there fooling people with no recourse."
Very disappointing and not worth the effort. Our first reservation which was made 11 months ahead of time was cancelled due to a change in the owners circumstances. We were offered a couple of poor alternatives which bore no relation to the accommodation we had originally reserved. We attempted to reserve another property which looked suitable but were told it was not available for our dates. The apartment is still being advertised on the website as being available for our dates. Dreadful customer service and no interest in answering enquiries or emails.
"I can only say that I have had the most dreadful experience with them. For $500 per night I am living in an apartment which is noisy, looking onto a building site and on the fourth floor of a building without a lift. I've booked for over a month and am now stuck with the apartment because they have my money. The first eight days I spent without proper kitchen facilities because it was dirty and everything was locked away. After a week three maids arrived and spent two hours i.e. six hours cleaning the kitchen and opening cupboards which had been sealed. The second bathroom is actually not plumbed into sewerage and makes a dreadful noise and smells. The shower is equally noisy. I am awake at 6.30 every morning listening to the people above using a similar shower. During the last maid service a bag disappeared from the apartment with a camera and other items in it. The company has done little about following up the issue. There is no personal contact except for about 10 mins. when you arrive and then you are talking to people at the end of a phone who never follow up. I would advise anyone to be careful. You don't get to see these flats/houses beforehand and you are paying up front. The description of mine is certainly nothing like it is to live in it and not worth the money I am paying."
Sounds unpleasant. Have you contacted the police about the missing bag?
"Hi there, I'm looking to book an apartment in Manhattan, NYC through them, but the rep is insisting we pay through a bank wire transfer. Does that sound legit, is that how you paid, or am I going to lose all my money? lol"
"Anyone paid through a bank wire transfer? I am about to book with them a location in the Upper East Side of NYC. The rate sounds a little bit ""too good to be true,"" and the rep is only accepting wire transfers. This is the link to the location. Any advice before I book? I am so scared!https:/…2772654"
I'dpost on the NYC forum and see what people's experiences/comments are there.Edited: 4 years ago 
I am waiting for the company to get back to me... so they say. I hadn't actually thought about the police - but will follow that up. We do have CCTV cameras in this street.

"In September this year my friend & I stayed in Carter Lane booked through One Fine Stay . We had a wonderful holiday - the 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment with patio suited us perfectly. It was clean and well cared for. The location was just where we wanted to be, close to St Pau'ls and the Thames, a short to walk to most places and near the tube. We were aware we were staying in someone's beautiful home so expected to have their possessions around us but this added to the feeling of home. The price was comparable to the cost of two rooms in a top notch hotel but so much better. Every dealing with One Fine Stay was professional, the photos and description of the property was accurate, we had access early in the morning on the day of our arrival and were able to stay until 6pm on our day of checkout for a reasonable cost. I highly recommend the Carter Lane property and would deal with One Fine Stay next time we are in London."
"I'll provide you with my letter to ""One Fine Stay"" after staying at one of their upper tier rentals in London last May......Sirs, I'm just back home from London. We reserved five nights at your property at Cornwall Gardens 53A. May 17th to May 22. I want to give you an opportunity to address several issues we had during our stay.We were very disapointed in the property in general....here's some specific observations.The carpet throughout the property is very old and somewhat worn.The large white lamp in the bedroom has a broken shade and does not work.Many of the push button switches on the wall don't work, leaving many areas of the property very dark.There are no electrical outlets in either bathroom making it very difficult to use hair dryers.The small hall bath has no light over the sink. Very hard to see when I was shaving. Also no shower....There is no TV in the bedroom. Not acceptable.There is no TV in the living room. Not acceptable.The only TV in the property is a tiny TV in the corner of the breakfast nook and the only chairs to use are very uncomfortable making it impossible to relax and catch up on the local and world news. NOT ACCEPTABLE.THE PROPERTY SITS ON TOP OF THE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY AND VIBRATES EVERY TIME A TRAIN GOES BY......TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A PROPERTY RENTED FOR THIS MUCH MONEY.Please let me know how you want to resolve this situation. This property should not be listed on your website or any website offering upper tier residential rental property...Thank you for your attention to this matter.One Fine Stay's response......a very small (couple of hundred dollars) credit for a future stay at one of their properties...."
"The company are pretty professional and responsive but in the end it comes down to the actual owner of the property to whom OFS have to refer when there is an issue. If the owner is away on holiday or just not picking up the phone then you are stuck. We rented a house during the hottest week in August and the owners had locked all the windows and hidden the keys and refused to let us open them because of security fears. We had no sleep and sweated buckets all night. The OFS owners are, in the main, not professional landlords and consequently do not all act uniformly, predictably or reasonably.Edited: 4 years ago "
"This was exactly my issue (as #123 described) when we stayed at a OFS property in London last year. The staff were extremely courteous, professional and well trained, however - they seem to be helpless in addressing specific issues concerning the operatability/habitability aspect of the property we rented for 4 days. Everything is good on paper, however - in realitiy if have an issue - you are really stuck with it unlke a hotel you have no choice to request a separate room."
I decided not to book an apartment with One Fine Stay as I usually plan well in advance and they required 100% of the rental upfront. I did not think this was reasonable and have since booked three apartments with Indigo Flats who I can recommend. They only require around 25% deposit on booking and have places in a number of locations.

"Total rip off - DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY !!!Told within 10 days of our trip to London that due to an emergency the house we had chosen was no longer available. Very passive customer care. Offered accommodation miles away from the original house. The company seemed disinterested in helping us. No compensation offered.NEVER, NEVER USE THIS COMPANY - Total rip offMy advice is use airbnb instead"
"They cancelled my accommodation in London with only 10days notice. They were useless. Passive emails, no acceptable alternative offered, no compensation for wasted time and effort, no assurance that charges would be dropped.NEVER EVER USE THIS COMPANY !NOT TO BE TRUSTED"
"We stayed in a One Fine Stay property in London for 9 nights in early 2016. Overall it was a very good experience. The flat was lovely and functional and very comfortable. It wasn’t perfect (one of the bathrooms was a converted closet), but whose home is? The service was very good, with a couple of minor irritations. The iphone was very helpful, both for contacting OFS with questions and for obtaining local information.So I recently went to the One Fine Stay site again to make another London reservation and was alarmed by indicators that between 1% and 4% of properties (depending on the area I searched) were still available for the August dates I am interested in, which is 7 months away. In a small panic, I grabbed something that will be fine, but was not necessarily my preference. Their cancellation policy is severe (basically, you can't cancel after 24 hours - you forfeit 50% of the fee - even if you want to switch to another property and even if the reservation is months and months away). I have since learned, through communication with One Fine Stay personnel, that in fact most properties aren't even available yet for August bookings. Essentially, I was tricked into booking and now they are unwilling to let me consider other properties without the severe penalty. Even though our stay last time was very good, I can't recommend a company that is untrustworthy and treats its customers this way. They probably would have made more money off me if they had let me consider other more expensive properties, but instead they have chosen to use deceptive marketing practices to make an immediate sale. I understand what other reviewers mean when they say One Fine Stay is only concerned with their property owners and not the rental customers. It is possible you’ll have a very good experience with One Fine Stay, as we did the first time, and I expect to be satisfied with our current booking (which we are stuck with), but you are also at risk of being taken advantage of so I can’t recommend them."
"We stayed at a very expensive OFS property in Kensington last week. Most appliances did not work, all windows were screwed shut, staff were too polite and sweet but never called back when they promised they would and did not resolve any complaints - flush not working, dryer not working... - unless we made several calls. I would not recommend OFS to anybody."
I had one great experience in NYC. that led me to book a second time. Wow am I sorry I did. I brought family to NYC for a fun week together. When we entered the flat it was filthy. And HOT. the AC has broken the night before. The staff sent a cleaning crew in after we showed them the filth. The maintaince guy is working on the AC but the upstairs bedroom is 92 degrees. ONEFINESTAY didn't offer anything but to try and fix it. What a horrible arrival day it has been. Cleaning crew and workman all over the unit. We had no choice but to leave and hope they finish by supper time. I will not ever book this company again.

Oh dear! Sounds awful. We are looking at using this company in NY in the Fall. Can you tell me the name of the specific apartment you rented? Thanks!
"We rented from One Fine Stay in both Paris (Rue De Villersexel - excellent location off St Germain- very posh) and London (Petersham Mews- nice but a little removed- would go closer to Kensington next time or closer to Oxford/ Hyde Park area. We had excellent experiences with both. I was pretty freaked out after reading the negative comments posted on Trip Advisor but everything was great. We were greeted by professionals and were given an iPhone that we could use as an internet hotspot at our apt and all over town. The draw back is you pay 100% upfront and once you pay there is no cancelation or even a change to a different area. The pro is for a little more than a hotel room you can have an amazing apartment. One Fine Stay does a great job of cleaning and replacing all linens and duevets with hotel quality white sheets and towels. They also made sure the home is stocked with TP, paper towels, soaps, shampoo and the little things needed to run a house so that we did not need to find a store. I will definitely use them again!"

"What a terrible experience. I just spent a week in Grand Cayman that travel keys/One Fine Stay almost ruined. We arrived at the house to find a home that was almost unrecognizable... talk about false advertising. The home was to sleep 12 but only sat 6 at the dinner table, crappy plastic table outside with a couple dirty chairs, only maybe 5 lounge chairs, dirty furniture, mold smell, rusty appliances and to top it off we were getting water boarded in the middle of the night from the air conditioner vents dripping all over us. We complained to the local concierge and received only a defensive attitude and emailed travel keys but didnt hear back for 3 days. We couldnt even stay at the house and had to find another home due to the conditions. Travel Keys and One Fine Stay is giving us a terrible time for a refund. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. #travelkeys #onefinestay #terribleexperience"
Terrible serviceThey mis-represented the location of the place!!! We ended 20 min away from the area we wanted to be. DONT USE their services
"I have, and now I’m completely stuck! Avoid!!!January 2018, my family booked a one week holiday in Cap Ferret. We literally booked flights from all over the world for our annual get together in the 1st week of September. With less than one month to go, we got a « sorry the property is no longer available » email...Having carefully selected a property 8 months in advance, we are now left with no viable options and still trying to figure how to rearrange our holiday."

We did and don’t recommend them at all.
BE CAREFUL !We rented an apartment in Kingston and found out it's not as described. no AC and not Serviced. quality is less than average for a very expensive rent and toilets smell sewage. we have heard nothing but promises. I do not recommend OFS to anyone.
"Judging by the number of posts which were removed by TripAdvisor for being deemed inappropriate, i can see that onefinestay has an awful lot of angry customers out there.I’m not surprised, as I am one of them. A booking made 8 months before my trip was cancelled at the last moment and they couldn’t have cared less. No compensation, no support, nothing, which left us scrambling to find an inferior alternative at inflated prices.Never again!"
"10 days notice is a shame! But what about 1 day notice!!! What cruels!!!! I can never ever in my life trust them!!! It’s totally illegal!! How do they think they have the right to cancel my confirmed booking just 1 day before my flight!!!!!!!!! This has never happened to me with all bnb rental sites, onefinestay are totally disrespectful and very far from honesty, credibility and professionalism!"
Bunch of thieves!
"Yes and I would say AVOID!!! Like many of the other posters we had an excellent stay in London previously then used them to book two properties in New York for a family trip. As it was summer it was important to us to have a fully air conditioned property which I made very clear to the company and I was assured the property was totally air conditioned. On arrival, asked about the air conditioning - there was one small aircon unit in the dining room, which did not work and two small units in two of the bedrooms. The rest of the house was stinking hot including the bedroom where my son was supposed to sleep. When I complained they sent along a maintenance man with an aircon unit which he lugged upstairs to the bedroom and which blew the fuses when it was plugged in. It had to be taken away again. I queried the fans which had been placed in every room - turns out they were put there by One Fine Stay, So clearly they knew there was no full aircon, they knew how important it was to us, and they basically lied to us. After two days of complaining they moved us to a 2 bedroom apartment which was air conditioned but my son had to sleep on a sofa bed in the lounge room which was open plan with the kitchen and dining area so far from ideal. We got no compensation for this. We had another apartment booked for a couple of weeks after that in a different area of New York which we cancelled and found other accommodation as we had no confidence that this apartment would be any good. All in all, a terrible experience which wasted days of my holiday trying to sort out and which didn’t need to have happened if they had been honest.Edited: 1 year ago "
"You do realise that those types of rentals in NYC are most likely illegal, don't you?"
"We were loyal customers of One Fine Stay until our most recent experience. We rented a flat in Chelsea for five nights and the condition of the flat was deplorable. The cost of the flat as over $550 per night. The sofa was filthy as was the carpet, the tile in the bathroom was cracked and moldy , the bed was represented to be a king and was in fact a double - the entrance to the home was filled with broken and dirty tile and we even were faced with a moldy bottle of tabasco sauce sitting in the kitchen, . We had to leave after the first night, and would have left sooner but it was late and One Fine stay would not respond with a solution the first night. One Fine stay was totally uncooperative and despite letters and photos which we sent to every level of the organization would not respond with any apology or compensation. This is so far different from the other times (more than 25) that we rented form One Fine Stay. We will never do so again . Beware if you do. The photos totally misrepresented the condition of the home and One Fine Stay despite their representation of impeccable homes which are inspected carefully would not admit that in this case they made a terrible error. We pay for One Fine sStay because they allegedly stand behind the quality of what they offer.r We would have been better off with a VRBO. Never again"
"We first rented out our house via Onefinestay a few years ago, and had overall excellent experiences. Everyone enjoyed our house, and we always found it in fine shape upon our return. But this summer we were shocked by the unprofessional, incompetent and dishonest way in which we were treated as owners: the team cancelled two of three bookings on us at the very last minute, without any compensation, claiming that our house was no longer up to standards which had ""changed"" since our last rental through them, even though nothing had changed in the house, apart from a few extra books and the small marks of a lived-in home. Crucially, we had not been told anything about changed standards when the bookings came in, and no team came then to inspect the house to ensure it was in expected shape, even though there would have been more than enough time to attend to details - so we left for the summer trusting all was fine, as had been the case previously. The cancellations happened literally days before the bookings were due to start. It was by then far too late to find other renters through other sites, and too late to cancel our own summer bookings. This was economically penalising for us, to an extreme degree. If Onefinestay had communicated effectively with us and been on the ground in time, none of this would have happened: we were effectively punished for their incompetence. We would therefore not advise this company to anyone who has a proper home - as opposed to a property owned for the exclusive purpose of renting it out, and that can hence look like a neutral, never lived-in luxury hotel. In which case, for the price they charge to renters, and given their profit-driven, cut-throat ethos, may as well rent out independently in any case. It seems - also from other reviews here - that the company has changed and is no longer a dependable operation."
"Absolutely THE WORST customer service experience I have ever had. Rented an apt in NYC with One Fine Stay two months ahead, OFS cancelled the rental 10 days before our arrival. OFS booked us in an alternative that was 1/3 more in cost and then CANCELLED that property 4 days before arrival. Promised return phone calls that I never received, shuffled my calls back and forth between answering services. Truly unbelievable disregard for the chaos, complications, and inconvenience these cancellations cause our family. Never again and I warn others."
"We rented 2 London apartments from One Fine Stay (summer 2019). Both apartments were nicely decorated and in good locations. Customer support from the local office was very good, thoughtfully responsive and quick. So why do we offer only 3 stars for these rentals? The greeter in the first home seemed mostly interested in leaving as quickly as possible and was minimally helpful. The apartment had a couple of rooms blocked to us, one of which was pictured on the OFS site as included in the rental. Also blocked to us were all the dishes in the apartment. Both problems were resolved quickly, but having to problem-solve immediately on arrival isn’t a good introduction. The greeter in the second apartment was helpful and pleasant, but he wasn’t knowledgeable about some of the basics of how to use things. Neither apartment had any written instructions (e.g., user manuals) for the appliances which are always helpful and often supplied by OFS competitors. The fact that there was major construction in the street in front of the second apartment rental was never mentioned in advance of our booking. So overall, OFS feels like an early stage start-up. It needs more work to get things truly right. In addition, our experiences with their competitors have been much better, so that’s who we’ll use in future."
"BE FOREWARNED: DO NOT BOOK WITH ONE FINE STAY!!Like many of the reviewers below, we had similar experiences. I honestly can't believe this company is still in business. Here are some of the myriad issues we had with (what seemed online like a gorgeous) 3-bedroom Parisian apartment booked through OFS: Wifi that barely worked (in one spot in living room it worked sometimes...); moldy washing machine; moldy soap in master bathroom; piles of books and magazines on the floors; drawers piled high with owner's belongings even drawers ""on limits"" to guests; owner's dirty laundry left under kitchen table.I can't emphasize enough how the owners' belongings where ubiquitous; it truly felt like we suddenly invaded someone's apartment without them having had time to tidy up.The response from OFS was ""I'm sorry you were disappointed. If you'd like a 10% voucher towards your next stay with us you can have one."" Really?? Stay with them again??!! No way. Don't make the same mistake we did."
book with a Travel Company for protection and advice.
"DO NOT use this company. We can not travel, we have a letter from the NIH saying so, our flight was canceled, and England and US have a self quarantine rule for 14 days. This company refuses a refund. They offer a voucher but I can not travel until I get a vaccine. I am going after them legally ! My attorney is doing it and it may turn into a class action. These people are scum.Stacey Iyer"
Krishen I - check out the following link to the UK Govt Competition and Market's Authority which spells out that they should be providing a refund in these circumstances. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…If the don’t consider the Small Claims court which I believe you can do on-line.
"As so many others have shared here, Onefinestay has shown itself to be an utterly uncaring and unethical company. We too had to cancel our planned stay in London due to government imposed travel restrictions and lockdowns in both the US and the UK. While “force majeure” is a legal concept onefinestay readily recognizes for homeowners, it turns a blind eye when such catastrophic events as Covid-19 affect the plans of renters unable to stay in their homes. In our case, despite admitting that the home in fact was unavailable for use due to the lockdown, they refused a full refund - offering a useless coupon for a future stay or 50% refund. As the saying goes, buyer beware, and I would caution anyone considering onefinestay for their holiday plans to absolutely stay away from this outfit."
"I mean there are NINE YEARS of warning here, diner. Not sure what your post can add to this, but this should be a lesson to you to research first, instead of after you have a bad experience. Heck, you've been a member here for just as long as this thread has been here so it's not like you didn't know about TripAdvisor and the value of researching before you give your money away"
"My Husbband and myself booked , what we thought was refundable stay through a travel company Onefinestay. We booked a trip from San Diego to London England. This all before Covid 19.Once the breakout started I became nevous because I have a rare genitic disease that affects my lungs and kidneys. I spent months explaining this to these folks and countless hours. Eventually they offered 1/2 our money back, as if that was acceptable. Please let me remind everyone that England and US have boarder and travel bans. They then offered us a credit to use them for other locations upto 12 months, still no full refund. Then they offered a credit upto 18 months , no full refund. Im not sure what situation life finds most people in but a $14,000.00 dream trip being canceled and a company holding our money for 18 months for example is NOT wjhat I signed up for and not what is acceptable. I am a patient at the NHI. The same one giving the US and much of the world direction and they firmly advised me NOT to travel any time in the near future. Until there is a vaccine and even then to be cautious to see if it works. This company has no ethics, no sympthy and should not be trusted. If they treat someone in my situation like this , how would you feel you would be treated? Its very unsafe to travel right now in my condition and its so unfortunite that among all of this Ive spent months fighting with this company which has seriously caused me distress. Stay away from this company at all costs, there are plenty others out there. Siyer"
"I am very sorry to hear this but contrary to what you wrote, this is EXACTLY what you signed up for. As you can see, this is a company with complaints going back many years. Their terms and conditions are clearly stated and you agreed to them.If your confirmation says REFUNDABLE, that's different, and you should pursue a chargeback through your credit card. If it doesn't say REFUNDABLE then you may have been mistaken in what you were booking and you may have to accept their offerYou really have to have high quality travel insurance when you are booking a trip like this, especially if you have medical issues."
WARNING!!!!Due to the epidemic & travel restrictions we were unable to use the villa we rented in May.They would NOT refund our money. I would NEVER use Onefinestay again
