"HI,Planning to travel with a toddler (18 months old) to Puerto Rico.. Yay or Nay? HEard about level 2 alert for Zika in Puerto rico. PLease let me know how bad it is. We were planning to go to the rainforest (El Yunque) hence the worry.THank you!"
"The Rainforest doesn't really have Mosquito's. They are usually in Urban Areas where there are puddles of water, where they breed.You should always use protection from Mosquito's just in case."
Please read about zika in the CDC page. That will explain wbat it is and whether you should be concerned or not.
Thank you @bunny123 and @nytoparis. CDC is where I read about the level 2 alert. I was worried about how bad is the mosquito problem as we cannot apply a lot of insect repellents on an 18 month old. A lot of ingredients are not advised to be used on children below 2 years of age.
"There is also Citronella Oil, check with your Pediatric. Lavender is also used to repel. I use a Lavender candle when I watch Tv in the evening. The Oils you can put on clothing, doesn't have to be on skinEdited: 3 years ago "
"Lavender and eucaliptus oil are natural repellents.Mosquitoes are not a huge problem, and especially not in the rainforest.My suggestion to read CDC page is so that you can read about populations at risk and symptoms."
"This will start things if just let go. NY is dead on, you should read and follow CDC recommendations.There are already postings, where the HHS on the island has dropped some of the warnings starting today."

"I am usually a magnet for mosquitos. We just got back and I didn't get bit at all. We were everywhere, beach, rainforest, Old San Juan and no bites. I used ""Don't Bug Me"" especially around my ankles. You can get it at Whole Foods. It has oils in it and no chemicals. We had also taken our Maxxi Deet from Bass Pro and didn't even use it."
businesswire.com/news/home/20170605006235/enThis article just popped up this morning
"Yea. they are popping up all over. Once we passed 40K in PR, I was happy to have anyone call it backing off. TX and FL for now, I am happy to see it leave."
"Hi Indrani, just curious if you ended going to PR. We are planning to go this week and I see Zika level 2 again. Was wondering if you happen to see a lot of mosquitos and anything to worry about? Thanks"
"I have not heard anything about Zika these day's or anybody that got sick. I am very cautious with mosquitos and use protection always. Just use Lavander, citronella or Eucaliptus oil if you are worried. There are hundreds of People going to the Bio Bay each week and nobody has mentioned it. That's were they do have Mosquitos, in the Man-grooves."
Thank you
