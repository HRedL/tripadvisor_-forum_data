I’m travelling to Corfu on 31st March is it safe
"the pandemic has been officially declared, it is better to stay at home."
"The news and advice is somewhat confusing for us here in the UK as from my research this morning, official UK government sites are not currently include Greece in any of the advised no-go zones and airlines are not cancelling flights wholesale to Greek islands as far as I can tell.Where travellers have paid for flights there is some doubt about getting your money refunded if you simply choose not to travel to a specific country.. If you are well and can be confident of not carrying the virus I would advise that you check with your airline on their current policy.I think we have to remember that many many more people are contracting it and surviving than dying from it, so we need to try to keep a sensible perspective."
"As of 16/3 there are no virus reports on the island....yet !!! We are certain that sooner or later we will heve the first case, no one beleieves we can get away with it. We just hope that with the measures tkane so far- and probably more to come, we will limit the spread !! Also, we hope that rising temepratures over the coming months will help, as well."
"My suggestion is not to travel to Corfu especially from a country that is not taking any action to avoid the transmission of virus.There so many of symptoms free carriers around.If you have to stay secluded for 14 days what is the purpose for travelling to Corfu?Stay at home.Last but not the least if you are screened positive it can be very problematic.Edited: 4:55 am, March 17, 2020 "
"""I’m travelling to Corfu on 31st March is it safe""Is your flight even still operating?Below is from GOV.UK Foreign Office:""The Greek authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These include the closure of schools, public meeting places, including bars and restaurants, museums and archaeological sites, beach clubs and shopping malls.The Greek government has announced that from 16 March, all people arriving in Greece from abroad are required to go into 14 days’ self-isolation.They have also announced that Cruise ships and sailboats are prohibited from landing in Greek ports."""
Hello hope you are well in this strange time as of the date - they're no cases of Coronavirus in Corfu
"Good morning!Corfu is still considered Corona free. However, the government has restricted the opening of hotels and other seasonal accommodation till 30th April."
"As of 6am this morning total movement restriction.Need approval (SMS) for going out on specific purposes only.No virus case in Corfu, yet !"
The UK is second only to the US in its awful mismanagement of the coronavirus. You should assume you’re likely infected. Stay home and don’t spread it.
No cases still! I hope season goes well so we can provide you with a great holiday as always.
"You will probably not find anywhere to stay.All restaurants and stores are closed.You can get groceries and pick up things at the pharmacy, but you must have a form declaring the purpose of travel and you should expect to get stopped by the police.They have already issued hundreds of 150 euro fines in just a few days."
I saw a reply from the ryanair twitter account saying that they plan to cancel flights for May after they've dealt with Aprils cancellations. Just in case anyone is booked to fly in May with ryanair as I am.
"#14. I think there’s only one reason why announcements about not flying in May are being delayed by many airlines....they, and the T.O.’s, are already overwhelmed trying to deal with those who’d booked to travel before 30th April. Can’t imagine planes will be flying wholesale again anytime soon."
"Hi, I'm confused, I do not have the virus nor anyone else but we have stayed inside. Does this mean we cannot go to Corfu until the end of April?"
You can’t go anywhere because there’s a ban on travelling to Greece and nobody knows when it will be lifted.
"SamSam there are lots of these one- post numpties asking daft questions , just ignore ."
"Oh, I don't know. It's nice to be nice. Also, last week I adopted some ill-behoving high ground from which to snipe at a poster who was asking what turned out to be a perfectly reasonable, face value question about internet speeds, and I still feel bad about it."
I agree.I was actually suprised to see the ryanair twitter reply admitting May flights will be cancelled. It's not like them to actually give any information before they absolutely have to!
corfu first case was diagnosed yesterday
We were due to visit in May but unfortunately not now. Hope your island can keep this virus out x
"Sadly only a matter of time, Jason, stay safe out there people."
"Oh no, stay in, don't wait for your leader or government to tell you"
"#25. Nice sentiments Karen but I'm sure the stringent restrictions being applied in Greece have already been adopted by the people of Corfu.....and all the other Greek islands too.The thread below gets regularly updated, worth keeping an eye on it for the latest information and details of any new restrictions that apply.... all over Greece.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…"
"Unfortunatelly, as of this mornig we have our first reported case here in Corfu. A Corfiot , 62 who has returned from Belgium on Mar17th and his home is at Evropouloi (close to Potamos). He was admitted to the local hospital with symptoms of pnumonia, all measures were taken to isolate him, tests returned positive today.. A few hours ago he was taken to Ioannina University Hospital, which is the designated COVID19 hosptal in the area.. The police is looking for any contacts he may had over the past days, even though he stated he was in self isolation for the whole period after his arrival... His wife is now in quarantine...Let's hope it does not spread"
Due to go to lesbos end of May do you think we have any chance of getting there?.
#28 Even if you somehow manage to reach Lesbos it is highly likely that you you will have to self isolate for 14 days.
Thank you for your reply. Stay safe.
"Pauly, No you won't get to Lesvos this May. This will not be over in a few months."
Is the corona virusin corfu?
"#28 You have gone astray... some 550 km.#29 ""somehow""?! All together with paratroopers? Desant? Or to swim?#32 What corona? It is an eradicated disease, along with cholera. Long ago... last Thursday."
"corfu was in lockdown before the person who had the disease was repatriated, the locals have to make a phone call and carry a form to get permission to go shopping at the moment"
Thank you for getting back to me. Stay Safe.
Stay At Home. Do not travel with a dangerous world pandemic in place.
Are you insane?
Going to corfu in june will it be possible
"Bob B, nobody knows for sure but the probability is you will not be going to anywhere in Greece in June. You don't say where you are travelling from but there probably just won't be any international flights."
"#40 Yes, of course you can travel.Go to Google now and look for a ""second opinion""."
yes it is! as of 30 March
impossible to tell for certain at the moment. but i wouldn't be expecting to personally if it were me
Did you go
I have a holiday booked for 10 days and we leave on the 4th May is it safe to fly
"Measures here in Corfu will be in effect until at least April 27th....during this period, everything is dead.. The outcome of those measures and the decrease in the spread of the virus will determine if we will gradually start some activities. I think that May 4 th is too early for lifting the ban on travel, especially from countries where the virus will not have been contained by then !!!"
"Sharan L, it is highly unlikely your flight to Corfu will operate in May. Even if Greece is relaxing their lockdown and similar in the UK by then, starting international travel will be a bit soon.Who are you flying with? What do the airline or tour operator say? I know Jet2 for example still says they intend resuming flights whereas EasyJet says no flights in April or May.Unless planes are being kept operational, they will all need checking before they can resume services. Ryanair is avoiding these checks by doing short flights with the aircraft."
The UK foreign office is now saying avoid all non essential travel indefinitely. Our flights for 16th May have already been cancelled. I’m surprised you could possibly have flights for earlier that have not been cancelled already? Who are you flying with?
jet2 have cancelled till 17th june been updated today on their website.
>>is it safe to fly<<What kind of aircraft do you have in mind? We cannot give a correct answer at least until you tell us exact type of aircraft and specify the part of the plane would you be sitting in. (it is desirable to specify the exact seat number)
"Some of the questions astound me!!! Will I be able to travel. Will my holiday be cancelled for May or June? There is a pandemic of a silent killer, it isn't discounting attacking anybody is shows no empathy whatsoever and has brought the world to a current standstill. Asking ridiculous questions which absolutely no-one can give a definitive answer to is frankly bordering on plain daft and you really need to sit back and have a word with yourselves!! Honestly."
"Phewww thanks Bigsnitch, I was expecting a torrent of abuse. I am always astounded at the naivety of people sometimes and questions I would expect a 5 year old to ask!! Is it safe to travel etc. Now unless these folk are living in some parallel universe unbeknown to us mere mortals, then the same applies. I also share your view that 2020 could really do with being re-booted and started again. As that is not going to happen, I strongly suspect the impact on travel will be severe for many months to come.I have a holiday booked for July to Cyprus for a wedding and like you I will wait until the last wire. There is currently nothing I or the travel industry can do about it at the moment due to the rapidly changing environment we currently find ourselves in."
"MichelleMy Greek friends who run an apartment block in Kefalonia contacted me on Monday to say they are keeping their appartments closed for the entire holiday season and won't be reopening until next year.I wouldn't be surprised if many others follow suit and realistically some of the smaller islands could completely shut to tourists until next year. My friend (who I spoke to on the phone personally) made it clear that they are genuinely scared of the large influx of tourists bringing the virus onto their island. Most islands simply don't have the infa-structure or health care levels to deal with it within their own community, yet alone with thousands of tourists as well.I believe Spain has just announced a complete tourist ban until at least September and wouldn't be surprised if Greece does the same thing."
"Michelle , there are a lot of these ‘one post wonders’ asking inane (being polite ) questions , appearing on various forums . Suspect people have time on their hands and think it’s funny . Best to ignore, take care,"
"mingalabarchris. Totally agree with your friends decision despite this all having an extremely serious impact on their business and livelihood. The alternative is not only a frightening one but very real and I believe that your health and well being is far more important at the moment. The fact that people want to go on holiday is immaterial at the moment. I do honestly believe like you that the islands in particular should an outbreak occur, not be able to cope with it at all and I truly think that it would be purely selfish for people to assume that they could continue to travel when the infection is so prevalent in society with what appears to be no let up on when it will finally be under control worldwide."
"123 twinkletoes precisely! a Holiday is a luxury pure and simple not a necessity nor a god given right. I believe that not only Greece but Europe in general will suffer great hardship this year, as well as the UK and further afield. It is what it is, there is nothing we can do to stop it whatsoever and we have to just hope and pray that they can find a vaccine to end this awful virus once and for all. A holiday can be taken any time but usually you only get one shot at living and breathing, and I know which one I prefer.Stay safe everyone and take care x"
I ihave to wonder if more and more European countries will just not allow tourism in 2020...a real tough choice but have to consider that things will get better for Europe before US and some other places in the world...we are still heading for our peak in many spots in US and no country wants tourist coming and spreading it. I hope Greece does not open for tourism ...they have done a good job it seems of keeping the numbers down...however not sure that is because low testing or what. Very hard to evaluate this pandemic country by country.
Yes Gene I share your views as well. I think undoing the hard work to keep places virus free or very much contained is absolute suicide. I think every single human being will be impacted by this across the globe and the world economy will be on it's backside for I fear many years but overall our health and staying safe surely has to outweigh peoples need for a holiday and Countries allowing mass tourists to visit potentially when the virus is still very much prevalent. Stay Safe Gene in the US xxx
"Tony, please don't take this as gospel because things can change so quickly in these difficult times but the last I heard from friends who live out there was that Corfu was in total lock-down with no flights going in or out. Residents were only allowed out for food shopping and were being fined 150 euros if they broke the rules!! I don't know which airline you are flying with but Easyjet are currently grounded for possibly another month -don't know about any others. We love Corfu and go there every year but unfortunately our usual May visit has been cancelled this year so I do hope that you are lucky and enjoy a wonderful holiday. kind regards. Gwyneth"
"Looking at these posts they are saying the same 2020 is a write off world wide unless you can get to a tropical island for a 1 person stay. Hopes are being said for 2021 but unless there is an antidote or we all get covid resulting in antibodies don't be too hopeful, who wants to spend 3 hours with others in a metal tube!"
up until today 17 April there are 4 cases of COVID-19 in Corfu... Things are 'safe' but we all have to follow the instructions... future seems very uncertain at the moment for all travellers ... However keep safe and optimistic !
Corfu and Greece in general did the right thing and I believe that they should continue to keep out any visitors from places where the virus is absolutely rife. Remember this is a silent killer that has caused global mayhem and doesn't look like it is ready to give up just yet.
Don’t worry Corfu we will all be back with you hopefully 2021 my thoughts of Corfu and all the friends I’ve made are keeping me going stay safe
I have been going to Corfu since 1982.Im due to come out 6/8Not holding out much hopeBut will be back asapStay safe all on my favourite island
"Are you serious? Cancel your trip, the country is closed and so is the world"
I can’t believe you don’t follow the news or common sense
"Hxa, in Europe, where day is placed before month, 6/8 means August 6th. I suspect you are from the USA where 6/8 means June 8th. Many people still hope the islands will be open again by August, so that’s not an unreasonable expectation. Personally I have no travel plans for 2020 or early 2021."
"Also the advice to cancel your trip is not a great idea , you wait and let the airline or holiday company contact you and advise your flight is cancelled and then chose your options . Many people have cancelled and lost money,"
I am actually from the UK So 6/8 means 6th AugustSorry for the confusionI can not just cancel as I am booked through a travel company and therefore have to follow their directive.I have claimed refunds for 2 stand alone flights 1 for 28/4 and 21/6I hope this clears up any misunderstanding
Is the virus in corfu
"#74. That’s the title of this lengthy thread, to which there have already been 73 responses. Why not take a look through at what’s already been said?"
"The heat will not kill the virus, if it did there would have been no cases in hot countries eg Australia who have just had one of the hottest summers on record."
Nothing to do with Australia hot summer they locked down early closed there borders same as new Zealand .yes we all are fed up yes we all want to go on holiday but not if it cost life’s stay home stay safe
"Hi Susan. You might like to read #50 onwards in this thread. Interesting to get a first hand view point from a regular Australian poster.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g644…Edited: 10:13 am, April 27, 2020 "
Read post doesn’t say about hot weather and Covid-19 stay home stay safe I’ve got friends in Australia and yes it’s not so congested as other countries but early lock down definitely helped them as it has in Greece
"Sorry Susan, which post on this thread are you actually taking issue with, cos I hadn’t mentioned Australia’s climate in #77? Was obvious heat wouldn’t kill the virus because some Far Eastern countries had already been badly affected.Edited: 3:03 pm, April 27, 2020 "
Hello. Hope you are well. How are things in Corfu currently(3/5)?
Has Corfu got Coronavirus?
Everywhere has got Coronavirus !You need to elaborate more on your question if you want a more detailed answer ! Presumably you are planning to visit Corfu ?
I am travelling to corfu on the 1st of August do you think it will be okay
"I'm afraid you'll have to join the huge list of people who have received the same answer - you will just have to wait and see what happens. At the moment it looks very unlikely, but who knows ?"
"As the previous poster has said ""who knows"".We have lost our June holiday and will wait and see how our September/October holiday turns out.Not too bothered to be honest as long as we are all safe. My only problem and my partner feels the same is that where we stay the owners always put all their profits back into their business. Very unusual for some parts of the island. Before anyone starts having a go. I have stayed on the island at least forty times over the years in most parts of the island. It breaks my heart to see a very hard working family receive nothing back from their investments this year. I won't tell you where I stay but they have spend thousands and thousands on their three small properties over the past five years. We have already booked for ten days for Greek Easter next year and for 25 nights next June. We will book for September/October when the flights come out.We are just trying to give something back to the people who have looked after us so well. Their holiday season this year is a total disaster as it is for all businesses on the island."
Their is. First one recorded yesterday. 60 years old Serbian tourist. It's in North of Corfu.Stay safe pplz
what is there to do in Kavos right now? Are bars and clubs open?
"Hi, we're going to Sidari in Corfu in September and was wondering about whether local restaurants and bars preferred to be paid in cash or by card currently. I usually pay in cash, but because of the covid-19 crisis I know here in the UK the preference is for card payments, is this the same in Corfu. Thanks for your help."
The preference is still cash.
I have just returned from my week in Corfu.So glad I took the chance and didnt cancel.All the Corfoits that we met were thankful that tourists were back and helping to boost their economy.We stayed at the Labranda Sandy Beach were they had put things in place to cope with the covid situation.Staff wore masks and gloves at all times even in the 30+ heat and hand sanitisers were available around the resort.Sunbeds and dining tables were well spaced.Thank you Corfu for another fab holiday cant wait to come back.
