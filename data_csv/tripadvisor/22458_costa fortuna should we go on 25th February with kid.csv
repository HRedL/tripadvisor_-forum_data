"Hello, we have a cruise with Costa Fortuna from 25th February from Singapore (arriving there on 23rd of February) .Our stops are Kho Samui-Leem Chabang overnight-Cambodia Shinokuwille-Singapore. Is there anybody on the Costa now with the same itinerary?Anybody can help to decide if depart or no from Europe with 9 yrs old kid?Costa Cruiseline is ready to do every protection?What if we will be in quarantin instead to travel?Overall we can have the infaction on Qatar Airlines too, or of course here in the city in Europe, but more likely there we can get the virus.As Thailand and Cambodia probably will have fewer secutity measures than Singapore.If anybody is there right now please send opinion.Thank you very much!"
I wouldn’t take my child anywhere near the Coronavirus.
At this point more people have died from Influenza in the US than has died from Corona virus around the world. I would be more worried about flu in your kids classroom being the likely thing that will ruin your cruise.
"hello, we were on the same itinerary but we have chosen to cancel our trip.we didn't want to finish in quarantine as the cruise in italy and japan."
"looks like Costa has cancelled all Feb cruises departing from Asia https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5016/Does not mention the Fortuna thoughEdited: 2:41 pm, February 06, 2020 "
not worth going at this time...assume they will cancel...good luck.
"Hello, thanks I got from Costa non written answer they are still going on with cruises departing from/to Singapore -no Mainland China at all - but Thalinad, Cambodia yes.Over all Diamond Princess - crew and passengers - have a very sad situation."
"We are a french family with 2 children 8 ans 14and have a cruise with Costa Fortuna departing the 18th february. We asked Costa to report our Cruise, but they refuse. We wanted to cancel, but we will loose some money."
"I had earlier thought of booking a cruise but now there is no way that I would think to risk a similar nightmare situation as with the Diamond Princess or the Westerdam. Who knows how long one could be quarantined and unable to return home? Scary!Meanwhile, I'm even concerned about an upcoming Lufthansa flight from JFK to Munich in several weeks. What happens if even one person gets ill on board and seems to have the corona virus? Will all the passengers possibly be quarantined?Last week I returned from Frankfurt to Newark Airport. A few of the Lufthansa crew told me, as we chatted in the galley, that they are scared to death of having this happen to them and they are not yet allowed to use face masks. They told me that if this happened, we would land in a special part of the airport and then the determination would be made by health officials whether we should all be quarantined or let go."
"This is a very personal decision that is bound to be impacted by an individual's own health circumstances, as well as the make up of their party and personal feelings.My wife has decided not to cruise at all this year, because of an article she has seen describing cruise ships as a 'floating petrie dish'. Apparently this was on the BBC here in the UK. I wouldn't have made such a decision myself, but i'm not going to argue with here. I know the consequences of that, lol!So I think everyone has to make their own decisions. I'm very glad we have nothing booked, so we don't have to decide whether to cancel or not.It would not have been an easy decision had we been going cruising anywhere in SE Asia."
We are a group of 6 on the same cruise as you and we have cancelled.
"Hi, we booked such cruise over 1 year ago (we are from Italy) and we aren't so young. We are non scared by contagious because I think costa is paying the utmost attention to avoid further ""sh...in the fan"". The issue I worry will be to have excursions canceled and time losses. A further (big) quroblem is that I booked Qatar flight with MO insurance for refund and I will loss 100 of the price. With Costa I can cancel anytime with full refund"
"We booked this ship for a 16 night cruise departing March 3rd from Singapore. With the current situation, we are not sure if we should take the risk. The cruise agent informed us a week ago that Costa will monitor the development of the Coronavirus closely and we will be notified if there's any change. We were also told that we will not get any refund if we cancel. We are very disappointed with this irresponsible decision of Costa for not cancelling the sailings not offering refund under this very unusual circumstances which will only put passengers in health risk."
Costa haven't made a decision yet by the sounds of it. They want to run the cruise if they can safely do so. If passengers are worried then they can decide to cancel but should not expect anything back from Cost unless or until the company decides to cancel the cruise.Maybe some passengers will be covered by their travel insurance.
"Please do not go! I did the same itinerary in January with Costa Fortuna. I cannot put into words how disorganized this cruise line is. I’ve sailed before with Holland America and Royal Caribbean, and the difference is very clear. Since we went in January, there was no threat yet of the corona virus. I can’t imagine how will Costa Fortuna operate in a crisis situation, when they couldn’t even get their act together without a crisis. Please do not put your family’s well being in the hands of these people! Just the fact that they haven’t yet cancelled this cruise should tell you how much they care. We loved visiting all the places we went, but from day one we realized Costa Fortuna was just for transportation, nothing else. Gosh it would be a nightmare to be quarantined in that ship. Also, to fully enjoy these stops, you need to be open to ride on everything that moves, a lot of times in very crowded transportation. I couldn’t imagine doing all that now with this virus. Singapore and Malasya are very organized, just like a first world country, but Thailand and Cambodia (specially Sihanoukville) are not."
"Also, not a lot is yet known about this virus, including its incubation period. Just because they are checking temperatures doesn’t mean it is safe. Responsible cruise lines have cancelled cruises in the region and offered guests full funding. The fact that Costa Fortuna has not, is beyond irresponsible, but not surprising. https:/…"
Hi! We have booked the 16- day cruise starting on March 3 and we are really worried to go. We realise it is no fun going on a cruise now and we can't relax and enjoy any excursions under such circumstances. It could be more stress and a waste of time than a holiday. All cruise companies cancelled their activities in the region and the fact that Costa are stubborn and willing to continue is very disappointing. They insist they still care for our health and welfare but everybody knows this is not possible. Orange code for Singapore where we have to embark and disembark...this is not normal....Probabbly it is better to lose all that money than go through such torture... will be thankful for all shared opinions and experiences!
JULIAMore cruise lines are pulling out of Asia for next several months I would keep calling Costa with your fears & hope they will cancel the trip At this point you will probably lose all your $$ so may as well wait until as late as possible in case they do change their minds JMOUpdates https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5016/#ncl
">>>Probabbly it is better to lose all that money than go through such torture<<<If that's how you feel then you would do well to cancel now rather than wait and see what happens. You can't put a price on peace of mind.Then again, what do you have to lose by waiting? If you're going to lose a lot of money anyway, what harm does it do to wait and see if Costa do cancel and then take a refund if they do?You could cancel or just not go at the very last minute and not be any worse off."
How did you manage to cancel We are going on the Fotuna 1st March and qere told we would not get a refund. We are not comfortable going with the current situation. Any tips in how you did this would be appreciated
"Why oh why can't costa cancel notice 2 more cruislines have cancelled trips today. Is Costa just so greedy! They say they have the health and safety all at the forefront, I don't think they give a damn."
We booked Costa fortunate 3march from Singapore through auk travel agent we are told that Costa have not cancelled this cruise yet we are very upset and feel Costa are extremely irresponsible it needs as much bad publicity as possible to make them change their minds and cancel this cruise
PS we will never cancel with Costa again
"Hello, it is your choice ultimately - however we have just returned on 19 Feb from a week on Costa Fortuna after 2 days in Singapore .What I can tell you is- our Singapore hotel checked our temp every time we entered the hotel (useful I think)- In Singapore approx 20% wore masks on MRT etc (however lots wear them anyway for pollution issues etc) we visited many tourist sites- Costa took temp scan when entering ship at all ports- Costa made no mention of virus the whole trip, I saw only 1 couple wearing masks on cruise (they were korean I think)- Trips to Koh Samui/Pattaya/Bangkok were business as usual either with paid Costa tours or private transport- Cambodia (16th Feb) turned out to be a farce - first we were told everyone- whether leaving or not had to pay visa charges about 40 dollars I think (a rip off if like us not planning to leave ship) delays for over 2 hours to disembark- Finally told delay was due to Cambodia gov. deciding to do each passenger visa individually rather than whole ship in one go.-Next announcement said Gov only allowing Costa booked tours off ship and they left ship- Next announcement said no private taxis or tuk tuks were allowed to take passengers on land but free buss shuttles to beach allowed- Those than went to beach said terrible roads /poverty and not nice beach-Those that went on Costa tours said the planned tour changed (as no tuktuks as in tour plan) and got a slight discount- No info given about the other ship in dock & problems with virus on it-no info from Costa on board- Those that left were charged for visa.- Flights backs to UK via Dubai were fine.Hope this helps with your decision"

Thank you very much so did the other ship actually have the corona virus on board
Thank you very much did. The other ship have the corona virus onit
"I don't know what your citizenship is, but the US Dept of State has issued some sort of advisory (haven't read it yet myself) suggesting Americans think twice before cruising in Asia. They have issued a warning telling people not to travel to China at all. This isn't quite as serious as that; still it's something worth taking into account."
"Among other things, US State Dept is advising cruisers and other travelers they should not assume govt would in the future charter repatriation flights as it did this past week. So you might find yourself on your own if you run into trouble."
"Yes, you can no longer take the chance and expect to be repatriated Or for free when something goes sideways. You have been warded and may choose to go anyway, at your own risk.Those charters were for people who were caught out by remarkable circumstances. That won’t happen anymore."
"Hello,I have the same problem. I have a cruise booked with Costa Fortuna for the 10 March and to be honest, I am scared stiff and paranoid, just listening to the news etc. Additionally, I have been advised I might have to ‘self isolate’/quarantine myself when I return.Tried asking Costa for a refund given these exceptional circumstances but their reply was that the cruise was going ahead as planned!!Edited: 9:40 am, February 22, 2020 "
"Re #32 Who told you you might have to self isolate/quarantine when you return? Was it your cruise line? Is that in the fine print of your contract with them? Whoever is saying that, are they guaranteeing you won't be hauled off to quarantine elsewhere? I might raise these issues with them. I might also ask them, since State Dept has made clear they likely aren't chartering any more flights, whether cruise line will be chartering flights in event you get stuck in quarantine elsewhere. You might also want to look at article just posted on NY Times website regarding total failure of procedures on Diamond Princess, including before Japanese authorities boarded and took control of ""quarantine,' when ship still theoretically still under control of Princess. Ask your line what procedures they have in place to ensure that doesn't happen on your ship.If you do decide to cancel, I would wait until last minute, not a second before you have to. Good luck.Edited: 12:45 pm, February 22, 2020 "
If you are scared stiff then it doesn't sound to me as if you'd enjoy the cruise. But you don't have to make a decision to cancel now. You aren't going to be in a worse position if you wait and see if Costa do cancel.
"Yeah,I mean I can’t possibly enjoy this holiday I was really excited and looking forward to visiting all these countries but now with all the restrictions and health warnings in place, it’s going to be difficult to relax and enjoy. Also, just thinking that the cruise experience could easily end up like Princess is enough to cause distress! I agree, given the circumstances it is reasonable that Costa should just cancel and refund their customers. I am sure that cruise lines are insured or will be compensated someway!"
"Re#35 That is very nice that Costa is denying boarding to anyone showing symptoms. I wonder if anyone has told them this illness is often spread by asymptomatic people. I wonder if Costa knows several people who tested ""negative"" for the virus before disembarking Diamond Princess with ""clean bill of health"" have since tested positive in their home countries. I wonder if Costa has protocols in place to deal with situation where there is or has been an infection on board and public health officials have yet to arrive. Princess apparently did not and in that precious day or so allowed shipboard life to go on as normal, with lots of communal gatherings, people lining up close together for buffet style meals and sharing serving utensils. Personally, if I were going on this cruise I would want a copy of whatever written protocols Costa has adopted to avoid Princess type failings."

After some discussion with travel agents which at the end were very helpful we managed to postpone it for November.
"If you are worried so much, don't go. Holiday should be fun. In this way it is not."
ARTUROThat is good newsDid you get the cruise fare moved to the new cruise without penalties??
"Yes we could move the cruise with no penalties, we got a refund for the hotel, but we have to pay a penaltie of £200 per person for the flight's but at least we don't lose the total amount.Edited: 2:13 pm, February 23, 2020 "
I would be interested how you managed to cancel because we have been told we will not get our money back
ARTURO Good news  probably worth the GBP to have to worry the whole trip if you will get sick or not
Sorry we didn't cassalled we arranged with the company to postpone it from February to November
"Did you arranged it with Costa Cruises directly or your travel agent you bought tickets agreed to postpone?Regards, JacekPS We have almost similar situation"
"That is fortunate.My travel agency Logitravel won’t refund, reschedule or credit. Neither will Costa Cruises, and my Travel Insurance won’t cover the cancellation costs. Singapore Airlines will charge me over £600 for rebooking fees and Government/airport taxes if I want to change the flights for later....so unfair !!"
All my arguments were done with my travel agent she spoke with the air lines and with costa.
Cat we are really pleased with our travel agent its Elite travel from Gib.
