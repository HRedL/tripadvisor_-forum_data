"""Great example these 2 women are for the LGTB community.""I find this comment offensive, What about the many thefts carried out by the straight community? It is completely irrelevant.."
If it was brought up in court and the media also noted it - then it must have relevance.

"#1 - no, it just said they were in a relationship. It didnt mention what the relationship was and it could be a business relationship. you assumed."
"**Their lawyer said they did so out of ""desperation"" because food is so expensive in New Zealand. **yep, blame the victim. I had to steal as you made my luxury goods too expensive. I have been poor in France - we ate simply and skipped alcohol and all luxuries. We had fun being creative. The judge made the right call."
This is wrong in any country in the world not just New Zealand but it does send a message which is what the judge wanted to do.If you can't afford to go on holidays in a country don't go of if you steal and get caught (and you should) it is nobodies fault but your own.As per post #6 ==The judge made the right call.===
"Shoplifters are shoplifters, I very much doubt it is a state of mind that you can switch on and off, hence the repeat offending. If they were at home they would be shoplifting there instead of on holiday.Being habitual shoplifters has nothing to do with ""doing your budget and allowing spending money for expenses""."
Just 2 women ( aged 21 & 25 ) who were in a relationship ( according to the court report) who repeatedly stole - not because they were starving but because they thought they could rort the system. As I stated before - most Asian countries would have deported them as criminals.
"This was a good 20 years back, but I remember visiting what is now Countdown Springlands in Blenheim. By the checkouts was the following sign: ""Free ride in a police car for every item stolen"".And let's not forget if you're convicted and the judge is having a bad day, you get free accommodation with all meals included at the ""Milton Hilton""."
