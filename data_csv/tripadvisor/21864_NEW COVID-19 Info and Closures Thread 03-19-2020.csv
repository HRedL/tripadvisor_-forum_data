"Good morning,I am starting a new COVID-19 info and closures thread because things are changing in major, major ways. Like the other info thread, I ask that people refrain from turning it into a political battleground or a complaint thread.Effective tomorrow morning, 03-20-2020, the County of Maui goes into Emergency mode. This means ALL non-essential services and operations will be closed. This is NOT an option---it is an official and legal order from the Mayor. While many have already closed, there are others that have not.With regard to retail or shopping: Only vital operations like grocery stores and pharmacies will be open. They may well have limited hours and/or limit the number of people in the store at any time. Be prepared for waits. Gas stations and some medical clinics will also be open, but may have limited hours. Restaurants: All restaurants and bars MUST close any served dining/gathering areas. Restaurants are allowed to do takeout and delivery. No seated areas in any restaurant can be open---period. Many will close, totally---others are trying to do takeout.Roads: The Road to Hana is CLOSED. Both directions. While it is closed due to COVID-19, they are going to use the time to do major work. Unless you live in Hana or have confirmed business there, like delivering goods---you will NOT be allowed to go. The closure is also in effect for the ""backside"" route from Ulupalakua.The Kahekili highway from Wailuku to Kahakuloa Village is also CLOSED. So if you try to drive the ""back road"" from Kapalua to Wailuku, you will be turned back at the village. If your try to drive it from the Wailuku side, you will be turned back.Tours, Luau, Boats, ETC: All tours, luau, boat trips, attractions, and venues are covered by this order as well. They MUST cease operation by tomorrow morning. Many already have or are in the process of shutting down. Included are museums, the Ocean Center, concerts, luau, whale watches, cocktail cruises, ziplines, bike rides, etc.This is a first for Maui....just like everywhere. Please understand that tourists are truly a hindrance and a danger to themselves and residents right now. We do NOT have the medical personnel or facilities to deal with a large outbreak. These draconian closures are meant to try and limit the spread and increasing risk of a larger outbreak. If this gets a good foothold on the island, the results could be horrific for everyone.Here is an article which details the order: https:/…An d here's a list of some of the closures and places doing takeout:https://mauinow.com/category/coronavirus/If you have tours or activities booked, you should receive a full refund.......most operators will be honorable. If an operator refuses to issue a refund, I would complain to the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs......or better yet, file a chargeback request with your credit card company.If you have a condo booked through an owner or smaller agency, check with them for a credit or refund. Please point them to the Mayor's order if they want to claim ""all is normal"".If you have a trip planned soon--PLEASE, PLEASE---cancel it. Coming here now is not only a bad idea, it's dangerous to us and you as well.Mahalo, be safe, and visit Maui someday when this is all over----SW"
Here's another article:https:/…
Thanks for the info. How long are the closures for?

"You're welcome........sorry to be the bearer of bad news.Right now, this is in effect for 60 days from tomorrow.Do note...it is actually a criminal offense (misdemeanor, up to 5K fine and/or a year in jail) if a person is found guilty of violating the order. That may help prevent the unethical ""private "" unlicensed guides and some other shady people from trying to conduct tours and such.I beg people to respect this order. Think of it like Kaua'i's mayor said........but sub ""Maui""---Maui is on vacation for 2 months."
No worries. I don’t have travel plans this year. I’m more so curious about how this is affecting local economies relative to service workers and hourly workers with their hours being cut some might not be able to pay rent / mortgages / other bills.
"I didn't mean you specifically, Blaze :-).......but anyone and everyone reading it. Mahalo for being thoughtful and SAFE.The impact has already been felt here, for several weeks. Many people are hurting and it will get much, much worse. They have waived the waiting period for unemployment claims, which will help some. Hawaiian Electric has also stated they will not disconnect anyone's power for non-payment for at least 30 days....I'm sure they will extend that.There is a move *nationally* to suspend all foreclosure actions. Locally, people are asking landlords to be kind, but who knows."
All good. I thought your answer was directed at me since I asked the question. Sorry for the confusion but glad anyone reading your info will know how long the closures are for. Be safe and mahalo.
"Once again, THANKS SW, for the updates and info. Stay safe in these crazy times."
Denial must be rampant. Who would welcome exposure to Covid-19 virus left in a hotel room or condo by the last guest...or the cleaner? This virus survives three DAYS on hard surfaces. Everyday LIFE is currently 'closed'. That just hasn't sunk in.
Thank you for the update. I started following restaurants in Wailea when I initially scheduled the trip. For the most part they are all closed now until further notice.. I feel for all of these businesses shutting down. I picked my condo at Elua because of the walkable places to dine. They don’t exist any longer. I’m hesitant to book a reschedule of my of the property because I see people posting don’t rebook for 12-18 months. We are waiting for AA to cancel our flights because at this point they will only cancel/reschedule until 4/30 without penalties. On a side note it amazes me that the resorts are acting like business as usual.

"Hopefully the airlines will extend, since this order runs to May 20th (so far).......I would try them again, Moveme. Can't hurt, right?Many restaurants that already did a lot of takeout still will-like Star Noodle, Honu, Frida's, for example. Merriman's Kapalua has *extended* their hours in order to make doing takeout worth it...they are offering takeout from 11:30 every day until 7:30.It will take a little more time for restaurants to catch up with this."
"Hopefully, this will make the islands less appealing even with the low airfares. Watched the local news last night and they interviewed this couple from somewhere who came for the low airfares. I wanted to reach into the TV and smack them! Think that the feds should not subsidize those airlines offering cheap flights during this time."
"It appears that the order only goes through May 4--not to split hairs but if people are calling about refunds, I think this is more accurate. You can see the actual rules here:https:/…""..60 days after the date of the County's Proclamation of Emergency Disaster dated March 4, 2020."""
"Yep--good catch, it was changed to that!Lots of moving targets in this situation. Glad you saw that change, Beachie."
"Thanks for the info and all your previous posts about what is happening there. We had a trip planned forb ext week. Last family vacation together. I cancelled on Monday. I waited as long as I could. It was the posts here that finally convinced me. Thank you and we will be there someday! Stay healthy and safe!Edited: 2:58 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Kij--thank YOU for cancelling. Not only would your trip not have been much fun.......you would have had a much higher chance of getting sick (thanks to airports etc).
"Just to confirm..........Mama's Fish House is closed totally, until further notice.Hali'imaile General Store and Gannon's also closed until this is over.Edited: 3:16 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"The State has finally released some info on the latest Maui case. It is a Maui resident--she came home from Colorado with the virus.This makes 3 for 3--all Maui cases are travel related. It's really 5 for 5, since the Kaua'i people were here first (and sick here)............but who's counting, lol.If I am not totally brain dead.....we are still at 16 cases statewide. All but one of them (even Daniel Dae Kim!) are travel caused. There is even argument about whether the Kualoa Ranch guide case was travel caused. I haven't kept up on that discussion.Here's the takeway for everyone: STAY HOME. DON'T TRAVEL. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!"
"Here's a very good article about hospitals and care availability on all the islands:https:/…Note the number of ICU beds on Maui: 29 (this includes some at Kula Hospital, which are always full). The total number of beds (again, including Kula Hospital which is always at 85-90% capacity) is 242.Compare your home location and its medical facilities. I suspect almost everyone has more medical care available and facilities available to them within an hour's drive, than they would here.Edited: 3:46 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Hopefully the airlines wont be out of cash (financially) by then, 50 to 100 Billion dollar Government bail out for the airlines probably coming."
Some more restaurants on the West side that are doing takeout:Leilani's;Mala;Down the Hatch;Joey's Kitchen;Duke's;Montage--Registered guests ONLY;
"An update from Lt. Gov., calling for 2 week quarantine of all arrivals (see, I'm not crazy, LOL):""Lt. Gov. Josh Green is calling for the suspension of all non-essential travel to Hawaii and the closure of all businesses and schools until April 30 to prevent a mass outbreak of the coronavirus in the islands.Green, who is also a practicing emergency room doctor on the Big Island and leading community efforts for widespread testing, said the state should also mandate a two-week quarantine for anyone entering Hawaii, “contact test” every positive case and completely isolate them and begin screening all passengers at local airports."""
That a very good thing. Only under mandatory quarantine will tourist stop arriving. Green is calling for... Who will have to approve and mandate? The Governor?
The Feds for any flights.The gov. For quarantine.
4 more new cases on Oahu today.......and 2 more on Maui.STAY HOME.
"And a battle of info is going on again..........Lt. Gov. Green says it's 11 new cases, not 6:https:/…"
"The Lt. Guv won.......mostly. The info is now published as 10 new cases, being 8 on Oahu and 2 on Maui.I think they are NOT counting the Tripler case. The State didn't want to count any military cases.The 2 on Maui are Maui residents who came back from Europe with symptoms."
They are working on a 14 day quarantine for all new arrivals according to Senator Dela Cruz
"And here's my take on that:They are proposing a ""self Quarantine"" now. Ummm.....hello--stupid, stupid idea. Trust me, I will stay in my hotel room? Trust me, I'll stay home?Let's see: We already had a good example of why this won't work. The 2 people who came to Maui (infected), and then went to Kaua'i (infected). What are you going to do--make them stay on Island #1? Or let them go on to Island #2? What about locals? Make me stay on Oahu for 2 weeks before I come home to Kapalua?While I love the idea of a mandatory quarantine, I don't think they have a handle on the logistics and complications yet."
"I ask that people refrain from turning it into a political battleground or a complaint thread.TB ""They are working on a 14 day quarantine for all new arrivals according to Senator Dela Cruz""SW: ""And here's my take on that:They are proposing a ""self Quarantine"" now. Ummm.....hello--stupid, stupid idea.""SW, I believe that is a political statement and a complaint...."
"I suggested the old Animal Quarantine facility near Haleiwa.  I figured that since the State wants to use it for a new prison, using it for tourist quarantine would be perfect.Not sure my idea will fly.... people are so fussy."
"SW,Thank you taking the time to compile all of these links.Hope that they will be useful to so many.Stay safe,Hunt"
"The state is rapidly working on a plan to quarantine all arrivals for 14 days. This would apply to new arrivals as well as returning residents. .Other than that we have been having flooding rain and an occasional tornado. Restaurants and bars are closing and there is a 9 PM curfew on Kauai. Because the first 16 cases of coronavirus were traveler related, tourists are not welcome at this time. Bob Weiner"
"Bob...Maui hasn't had tornadoes or tornado warnings--that was Kaua'i. We didn't have near the flooding from the Kona storm that Kaua'i and Oahu did either. This thread is about Maui :-).On MAUI---the Mayor's emergency proclamation took effect today. Many places had already closed, or in the case of restaurants, gone to takeout and/or delivery only (as required). Most tours and activities had already closed, or made yesterday their final day.....for at least 2 weeks.The Mayor will reassess the impacts of the COVID-19 and our status at the end of the month. The closures may be extended beyond April 4th; it is impossible to say now. The proclamation is in effect until May 4th, but the closures will be reassessed as I described.The home quarantine idea has many, many problems. Like who is going to babysit the tourists in their hotel or condo? And allowing them to stay in ANY property just continues the ability to spread the virus. The guv has mishandled and ignored the seriousness and danger too long. Now he is being called out by other politicians-even his own Lt. Gov. as well as more than 100 healthcare professionals. Media outlets are finally also coming out in support of stronger measures, but I fear we are already past the tipping point. I think we have been for about 2 weeks. Every island has many more cases than the numbers show.Again---if you have tickets--change them. If you have a reservation for a condo or hotel--cancel it. DON'T COME TO MAUI. We can't afford you.Edited: 1:57 pm, March 20, 2020 "

"Here's my answer to Olli, on another thread. He asked if people were still arriving/visiting Maui, despite the confirmed news, cases, lockdowns, policies, etc....all over the US AND in Hawaii.""Olli, sadly----YES. Many people are still coming, because by God--they got cheap tickets, a cheap condo...and health and welfare be damned. Not just *our* health and welfare, but that of themselves, other people on the planes, etc., etc.And let's not even consider what happens when they go home. What if they aren't allowed to actually go home-but forced to quarantine? What if flights do get cancelled or cut drastically (many airlines are already cutting flights by 60-80%)? What will they do?Do they have the money to extend a trip AND pay medical expenses? What if multiple members of a family all land in the hospital (see New Jersey....3 in one family died)? Then what????But those arriving don't give a ****. They are going to HAVE FUN. They are going to spread ALOHA and demand it back, by God.They are ignoring the closures of the Road to Hana and the Kahekili highway, complaining loudly about shortages and the lack of ""things to do"". That will get worse today.SW"""

"""And let's not even consider what happens when they go home. What if they aren't allowed to actually go home-but forced to quarantine?""Flip side of the coin, they do come home, but don't self-quarantine. Which I would venture is true of most people setting out on vacations now. And they're argument for not doing so will likely be based in part on the fact that people here aren't doing what they're being asked to do anyway. Feels like one big exercise in futility. ~ ColleenETA: You're right, Fireball. This is by no means a discussion limited to info & closures ~ as evidenced by my own two cents. The fact is that each topic goes in various directions & includes venting of one sort or another.Edited: 2:46 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"An exercise doesn't *have to be* in futility.....if people would consider the ramifications of action and inaction. THAT is my point when I post articles and comments about planning, or lack of.People can parse out my comments word by word, and stalk me (thanks, fireball!!!!!!). Or they can be grown ups and consider the whole picture..........and stop misrepresenting my posts, too. Again--we can't afford tourists here on Maui right now. We just can't. We don't have enough medical care or facilities for our own residents, much less tourists. We don't have enough supplies for our own, much less tourists. We will see even less fresh goods in stores, dairy, vegetables, produce and fruit, and meat as time proceeds.We will continue to see shipping shortages, delays, and cessation of some goods as this proceeds. I already can't get dog food.....because shipments are limited and spotty.

I have tried to post updates as this has evolved, and changed life here in Hawaii and Maui. I have tried to help people with reservations, cancellations, tickets, refunds, and future plans as well.What have you and fireball done, other than criticize me at every possible turn? Maybe you could both become part of the solution and not part of the problem, if you want to keep posting on these threads? Or is it just too much fun to act like moderators? Why not just skip anything I start or post, if I bother you so?I will continue to post my opinions, observations, and information as this goes on. I will continue to try and help people and support them when they make tough and good decisions, like cancelling trips. I will continue to try and help them navigate if they are here now........like whether the airport restaurants are open or not (a question last night). Large or small, I will keep trying to help people.I will continue to post that we have very limited medical facilities and only 242 hospital beds, 29 ICU beds, and 27 ventilators on the whole island........and that yes--NO ONE SHOULD VISIT MAUI NOW.

"Sue, I bet you will approve of the info below. I posted this in another thread, but think it may be helpful to people here too. I know you, BL and I have harped on medical expenses many times, but normally we aren't discussing personal experiences. I have posted the costs of medivac and medical evacuation to the West/PNW Coast before, but it's been a long time. Ironically--the costs are about the same as around 2 years ago, when I helped some different people with both.As I said below, I'm posting this to try and bring home the reality to people. I really hope it works. We are well over the tipping point now, and falling fast. One of the new cases today was a child, and two were admitted to be ""community"" based. ""Coach, no one doubts the pain of losing money. And no one is without sympathy......and many of us have lost money for one thing or another, too.But how much is your life worth? The life of your family members?When I had a week of 'vacation' in Maui Memorial less than a year ago, my bill for ""room (semi private) and board"" (godawful food *when* I was allowed any) came to just under 47,000. That's before insurance. Because I have outstanding insurance with HAWAII providers, the bill dropped to about 3K out of my pocket (plus since I'm a resident the Hospital wrote off almost all the GET Tax). But that was only ONE bill.The surgery and operating room bill was over 70,000. Yes, really. Insurance and the Hospital are still dickering on that one. The tax on that bill alone makes my eyes water.....and then we could add all the *other* bills I have gotten.......doctors, meds, antibiotics, on and on.I am telling you all this because I just don't think people really understand. Our medical care is far better than it was 12 or 15 years ago--but it is outrageously expensive and so very limited. Your insurance will be lower payouts than mine, and of course--won't pay the tax either. Yes, REALLY---the GET of just under 5% on Maui gets charged on medical and hospital bills, by law.The loss people take on a vacation is minor compared to the medical expenses they could so easily incur. Think about the numbers I posted above, and then also consider exceptional expenses-----If you need to be medvac'd to Oahu, an air ambulance runs about 25-27,000. And no family can ride in it.If you need to be medivac'd to the mainland, figure around 170-180K to the West/PNW coast. With only 29 ICU beds here, which are almost always all full--how lucky do you feel, folks?""Edited: 10:36 pm, March 20, 2020 "

"Kaiser is closing their Kihei clinic. They are trying to consolidate operations and hoping to be able to staff the other clinics by doing this.The County is closing ALL offices to the public on Monday. It was going to do limited hours, but they changed that last night. This won't affect most tourists but just in case.The calls for a 2 week quarantine are growing stronger. A meeting was held to discuss the logistics. We'll see. I think it could def happen in the next few weeks, but still believe a ""self quarantine"" for tourists is self defeating.Drive through testing starts Monday. You MUST have an appointment. It is in Wailuku.I mentioned shortages and bare shelves yesterday. Despite limits and more, places are def running low and empty. Shipments are wacky...often not having the items ordered, whether dog food pr people food. Or they are things like Christmas themed plastic wrap (what I got yesterday). Perishable foods and staples alike.....it's already a serious problem. It is like we saw after 09-11, but that took weeks to reach the same point I see now.I used to laugh when people asked if they should bring food with them. If you are stupid enough to visit now (yes, IMO stupid).......bring food."
"Re: Medical. Yes, *limited* is the kindest word. I couldn't visit Maui in January 2019 because no oncologist (not even in Honolulu) would agree to supervise me, nor could I feel comfortable relying on Maui Memorial to provide the lab tests or prepare the chemo I required weekly. I'd started working on this in July. My phone calls and emails, and even my doctor's faxes were ignored. When I threw in the towel and tried to cancel tentative appointments, there were no acknowledgements. It's too far to come, only to have to retreat home if/when this sketchy framework collapsed. I appears to me that there is barely enough medical care on island for residents. It's presumptive to throw ourselves on 'the kindness of strangers'. Even with Aloha, Ohana comes first."
"While most of you have been piss whining here all week my staff and I have been checking in on our senior customers. Making sure they have a ride to appointments, picking up and delivering their vehicles to them. This morning I took a couple of my nice folks over to the store during senior only hours. Oroville is a small community in the past several years we've been through our share of crisis. Instead of complaining we pull together and take care of our own. Instead of sitting in front of the computer all day why don't you go out and check on a neighbor or friend."

Friends who have been here and wanted to leave early have had quite a time finding flights......I've has several going through it this past week.Though flights are running full now--and larger planes are still being used---I expect that to change now that some people are cancelling. So those who want to leave early may find themselves closed out by lack of space.Maui Now is starting a new section that may help some tourists. It's a ""what's open"" section.

But there are plenty of things to do - running errands for people, sharing supplies of sanitizers, toilet paper & the like, calling those who are alone to chat so they don’t feel isolated, ordering groceries online for older people who don’t use technology, making sure they get out and take a walk if they can - staying 6 feet apart, of course, sewing masks for local health care workers, giving blood, reading stories and doing activities over FaceTime with kids who are homeschooling. These are just a few of the things my family & friends have been doing. There are many more.Guess what? These things can all be done & still have time to post on TA! I know SW is pitching in anyway she can. Actually I bet most Maui residents find it very helpful that she is asking visitors not to come at this time.Wishing you health and happiness."
"Teri, I know you and your whole family are *always* helping others and your community! I am lucky to know giving and warm people like you and Brian :-).This is a travel forum......not a community support or chat one. So no--I don't post bragging about what I or my ohana and friends do or have done. But we try in our feeble ways :-).My greater concern here on TA is def to try and get visitors to STOP coming to Maui now. Yes, it is hurting our economy and many people I know and care about. But the slow 'death' going on is worse than a quick cut. People don't grasp that their presence is a potential danger to everyone else.........much less that we don't have enough food, goods, medical care, etc. for our own residents. So each tourist is one more person to try and take care of--something we just can't do right now.Edited: 6:32 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"So the daily total jumped again. As of about noon today (Saturday), the state total is 48 (compared to 37 yesterday).2 new cases on Maui, 7 on Oahu, and 2 on the Big Island.Maui's total is 7.......not counting the two people who went to Kaua'i and were tested there. Plus there are a LOT of tests pending results.Most stores here have cut hours. Safeway isn't open 24 hours anymore, for example. Most are doing the ""Kupuna"" shopping hours too. Safeway here has finally started doing order and pickup outside as a result of this virus........ a nice touch for those in need."
Shout out to Captain Steve’s for canceling my son’s whale watching excursion scheduled for next week on his honeymoon trip and refunding our money without the slightest pushback. It is such a trying time for everybody. We go on their tours whenever we are there for the season and we have learned so much.
Ko Olina Hotels are closing Tuesday.
"Steve's is great--they cancelled all their tours before they were even required to.All commercial ocean tours, activities, lessons, etc. have been ordered cancelled indefinitely:https:/…"

"The part they lose is less than they will be out ifvthey come home with covid and are hospitalized, without a paycheck, infect others they care about. Gonna happen. Buncha morons whonwentbto Hawaii coming back in a tube...for 5 hours at least."
"I started a new thread about the quarantine. It will be in effect on Thursday, March 26th, at 1201 AM.So if you are arriving anytime after that, you will be forced to quarantine for 14 days.Tourists will be quarantined in their hotels or condos. You cannot leave except for medical care and departure home. Period.No shopping, no gas station, no dry cleaners, no food pick up, no hair appointments, no spas....NONE. I urge people to cancel their upcoming trips."
"Updated at 3p today starting on March 26, all visitors and residents flying into Hawaii will be required to do a 14 day mandatory quarantine. This means if you are traveling to the state you are required by law enforcement to remain in your hotel room for 14 days. If you're found disobeying the quarantine requirement, whether you are just driving to sightsee, or playing at the beach, you will be subject to fines and possible jail time..Maui's resources are very limited and 1st responders are working hard just to sustain our residents. Please reconsider coming to the islands right now. We love our visitors and will welcome you back with open arms when this crisis has passed. Mahalo"
"All County beach parks will close on Monday. This is a total closure, island wide.No parks will be open. Not state or county, until further notice."
Here's a link to the mayor's letter:https:/…
"Wrong and incorrect info is being spread....here on TA as well as elsewhere.Please understand that under the quarantine, you are NOT allowed to leave your lodgings for any reason except medical care or departing the island for home. PERIOD.This includes leaving to get food or other shopping--you are NOT allowed to do that. This starts Thursday 03-26, at 1201 AM (in other words, one minute after midnight ***Wednesday night***). Not Thursday day or night........... 1201 AM. The quarantine period is 14 days for ALL arrivals. The order itself is in effect until further notice."
Please make sure you under the latest orders:https:/…
"Whoops, **understand**!"
"Again, with Hawaiian cutting all flight but one to and from LAX/HNL, if you want to cancel or change--you need to be doing it NOW.Interisland flights will also be very thin.....I really, really hope people cancel and visit after this is all behind us. We can't afford tourists right now.SWEdited: 12:02 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"77 cases today---56 yesterday. Does that show anyone the increasing spike?Please, please cancel any trips until at least later this summer.........maybe later. We just don't know where or how bad this is going to get yet."
"Last night, the State casually announced the first ""official"" death from COVID-19. After the prime time news, etc.....convenient, huh?Very few details. It was an Oahu resident with multiple health problems. That's about all we know right now. It was NOT a known case."
A good article about the golf courses:https:/…
"So Leilani's and Hula Grill stopped doing takeout a few days ago. Turns out they had an employee who had COVID-19 a couple of *months* ago........oops.Very bad news too from Kaiser Health Systems. They have confirmed an employee tested positive. They aren't saying where the person worked but the ""talk"" is at the main hospital.Edited: 4:58 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"90 cases now in the state...""known"" cases that is.We were at 77 yesterday, and 56 the day before. On the 3rd of March we were at 2."
"And more bad news earlier:https:/…Read the comments. They are very, very important."
Here's a good summary of the Mayor's press conference late yesterday afternoon:https:/…
Numbers are so weird. They are changing them to suit their narrative.Now they say we have only had 6 new cases since yesterday.......since the death wasn't from CV-19. So we now have 95 instead of 96 cases. Right. Maui has 13. That's 2 more than yesterday.
Here's some info:https:/…
"And the number is going up steadily. Yesterday some politicians claimed we were already seeing the end of cases.......geez......how stupid.The new total of Hawaii cases that have been *confirmed is 106. That's up either 11 or 10 from yesterday, depending on how they are counted.Last week, a person died on Oahu. First the State said he died from COVID-19. Then they said he didn't......but also removed his case totally from the count. So it's pretty screwed up.PLEASE cancel trips. Aside from the quarantine, which is in effect for ALL arrivals until further notice, almost everything is closed and there's a ""stay home"" order.Here's some info from the Star Advertiser:""Of all the confirmed cases in Hawaii since the start of the outbreak, seven have required hospitalization, Hawaii health officials said.Today’s tally includes 77 on Oahu residents, 14 in Maui County, 5 on the Big Island, and 5 Kauai County residents. Three cases are pending identification of the county of residence, according to health officials.On Wednesday, Hawaii health officials said there have been 4,658 COVID-19 tests completed, all but 379 from private laboratories."""
"Gawd, it gets old trying to figure out why the State can't just be honest.They are admitting today that at least 3 of the new cases are prob ""community transmission"".....but say they don't know *where* those cases are. WHAT??? How can you not know what island the tests are from? No comment from them about the backlog of tests either. I know some of the delay is due to labs being overwhelmed (the private ones). But no comment about the State Lab's lack of tests and results.On another note...they said multiple flights that landed today had no passengers, or only one. I believe they mentioned the most passengers on any flight was 54.Here's an article:https:/…Edited: 9:50 pm, March 26, 2020 "
"14 more cases today........we are at 120 now (or so).On Oahu, they are starting to get serious about making either the Blaisdell and/or the Convention Center field hospitals.On Maui, they are considering some of the closed hotels. Here's an update from HNN:https:/…The scariest line is the one about 31 people in the hospitals.....but not confirmed yet."
Here's a good breakdown from Maui Now:https:/…
I forgot to post this article this morning. sorry!https:/…
Thanks for all the updates and links.. really appreciate it.
11 visitors?! That’s bold. Any chance they are family members?
"I don't know.......they could be people who just refused to cancel and will obey the rules, people who come and sit on their lanais every year anyway....who knows. I'm trying to be positive, LOL.You're welcome, Barefoot.......like everywhere, wild times."
2 more cases...16 total today (Friday). The 2 additional ones are Kauai cases.Our mayor is calling for an interisland quarantine.

"I’m curious about who are the medical professionals who are going to staff these extra offsite offsite medical facilities around the country. If they are stretched to the max now who is going to attend to the sick? That being said, in OC in So Cal there are 2 hospitals that I heard about nurses reporting that it is very slow. At one large hospital there were nurses being sent home or splitting shifts because they have no elective surgeries going on."
"I have a family member that works in a hospital in Washington state and she said it's slow there too. Unless it's urgent many people choose not to go to hospitals for the fear of contracting the virus. I know some hospitals postpone non life saving procedures to keep the staff for coronavirus patients. In places with the highest demand (like Italy ) retired nurses/doctors and medical students are being asked to join them.Edited: 6:09 am, March 28, 2020 "
"From Hawaii News Now:""The new cases bring the statewide total to 151.Here’s the county-by-county breakdown:Oahu: 108 ( 19 new)Maui: 16 (0 new)Big Island: 10 (3 new)Kauai: 11 (6 new)Pending: 4 (1 new)Diagnosed out of state: 2 (0 new)Additionally, 12 of the confirmed cases required hospitalization, the DOH said.""29 new cases today. 16 yesterday. 11 the day before.........anybody doubt the quarantine was too late?Edited: 6:58 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"Hopefully, we will soon have an interisland quarantine too."
"Another 24 cases today. Slower since not all results come in on Sundays....With increased testing, and increased ""standing"" in labs, we will prob see a pretty dramatic surge this week.

"We broke 200...........statewide, there are 204 known cases as of today.29 new ones since yesterday.https:/…"
"And 20 more today. We are at 224 now, officially.That's more than double where we were a week ago.........and yet more proof that we are nowhere near the middle, much less the end.Maui is steady at 25, but several of the new cases don't have location(s) yet.The State is also saying we have a death now.....Edited: 5:56 pm, March 31, 2020 "
34 new cases today.......only 1 new on Maui but most tests done recently haven't come back yet.258 state wide.
"And 27 more today. Statewide, 285. One more on Maui--our tally is at 27 now.There are a bunch outstanding........"
"I forgot to add that there has also been another official death from CV-19. I think we will see many more, unfortunately."
Here's some info on the second death. She was in her 50's and an Oahu resident:https:/…
I see Washington state is now under s lockdown until May 4th. I bet Hawaii will go through May too.
Moloka'i has its first case. That is a really bad sign.
"The Moloka'i case is scary. The man came back from Vegas and went back to normal life and work...in the island's ONLY grocery store. Obviously, they have had to close the store. He's in the hospital on Oahu.We also just got confirmation of the first case in Hana. She also has some travel history (she is a resident).People continue to come to Hawaii and Maui..........PLEASE stop. Just stop. We can't afford to take care of you as well as our own rising numbers.Edited: 5:00 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"Sad, the man who was the second case in the state has died. He was the one who went to Seattle, got sick, and came back at the end of February.34 more cases ..............we are at 319 now for the state."
"We went from 27 to 36 in one day on Maui. Even if you deduct the Moloka'i and Hana cases, that is 7 new cases overnight.......and those are just the confirmed ones.And yet 120 tourists flew in to Oahu alone on Wednesday.......and some to Maui."
"Nick:The Friendly Market Center in Kaunakakai on Molokai isn't ""...the island's ONLY grocery store..."" but it is the one where an employee tested positive for Covid-19. Misaki's is the other one. They're just down the street from each other. You must have just forgot."
You're correct! Sorry for my mistake .SW
"Sounds like these Molokai and Hanna residents haven’t understood the importance of not traveling themselves. Look, I 100% get that all travelers to Hawaii should cancel any imminent travel plans, but at the same time, COVID-19 has been running rampant for the past month, so that likely means these two residents made the unfortunate choice too travel in recent weeks."
"They did. The Molokai case was in Las Vegas and the Hana one was on a ski trip with her family. The majority of cases were actually residents that traveled. It shows that it isn’t just keeping outsiders out. It needs to go both ways. To be fair... the traveling happened before government was saying not to travel.Edited: 10:10 am, April 04, 2020 "
"Sorry, to expand... the Hana lady had her trip the 10th to the 20th. She says she’s quarantined since back. When she left on the 10th, they were still officially saying take your spring break trips... I know because I arrived on Maui the 10th. In the middle of that time was when all hell broke loose. Should everyone maybe have then stopped traveling and not traveled back home... probably... but the message was to get home and get the hell out... so yes people were still traveling during that time."
"Yes, and nowhere did I say otherwise about residents traveling......our spring break wasn't until after the stay at home and quarantine rules, but travel was recced against by the 14th or so. Some people jumped on those cheap airfares just like all over. I think it was stupid to travel after the 15th or so unless it was to get home....but that's just my opinion.The virus was imported by residents and tourists both. We don't really know how many tourists brought it, because of the long incubation period AND the fact that many left before getting obviously ill or being tested. There are cases in the mainland that are believed to have been ""cooking"" while the people were in Hawaii. Did they get it here--or bring it? Who knows......As for locally spread cases, as can be expected--Oahu has the most. The more dense population, more casual treatment of the rules, and other factors all add to that. But Maui is rising in numbers and will continue to :-(."
"Another thing that I wish all local officials everywhere would do is be mindful of the 6’ minimum separation in your press conferences. Assuming the photo is current in the following article, the maui officials are way closer than 6’ feet to each other. As silly as it may sound, they could really emphasize the importance of this by staying separated during these press conferences.https:/…amp"
"Excellent point!! And one that has come up before....to no avail, it seems.The Hana resident is in Wailuku, in isolation. The Hana community has been very supportive of her---even before they learned she was now in Wailuku.The Moloka'i man's family has been receiving threats......how awful and sad, and so wrong.Major cleaning and sanitization efforts are ongoing on Moloka'i---at several businesses."
Here's an article about the Moloka'i case:https:/…
32 new cases today...the statewide total is 351. 2 new ones on Maui since yesterday--we are at 38.
We also have now had the fourth death. They haven't released much except that the person was in the hospital on Oahu.
"""Only"" 20 new cases today. Remember it's Sunday and not all results get reported..... the confirmed total for the State is now 371. The fourth death is in today's stats. He was an ""elderly"" man on Oahu.A second case on Moloka'i was reported last night. I mentioned it in the Moloka'i thread earlier today. She is in isolation on Moloka'i, and the Friendly Market is closed for at least 2 weeks now. She and the first case (a male who is in the hospital on Oahu) both worked there.I know 371 cases doesn't sound like many to people from large urban areas, or states that have huge outbreaks. But for us, being small islands with small medical facilities (comparative).....that's a scary number. Maui County has 43 cases now, with the two on Moloka'i and new ones. We have 242 regular beds, 29 ICU beds, and 27 ventilators---so far, we've been very, very lucky to not need most of those. People should know that on any given day, AT LEAST 56% of our hospital beds are full, according to the survey done by the State. I can tell you that the ICU beds are almost always full on Maui. With tourists still coming, residents still returning from trips.......and testing improvements, we will likely see a leap soon. The scale has already surged this past four days. We are nowhere near the peak of the curve, much less any plateau or flattening."
Some residents are not currently practicing the spirit of Aloha:https:/… And Authorities are getting fed up with those who choose not to follow the rules: https:/…
"Yep, I posted about those earlier."
StarAdvertiser: Isle Mayors consider stricter safety measures; Tourist arrivals on the rise; Many not observing quarantine and shelter at home regulations; Lana'i reports first case of Covid-19 over the weekend. https:/…
KGMB reports this morning:371 total cases statewide20 new cases43 on MauiOnly the StarAdvertiser mentioned report of the first case on Lana'i. No other news outlets are echoing that report.
"I covered the cases in #130, yesterday.And no--there are NO confirmed cases on Lana'i.Yes, there will be new rules by tomorrow......I don't know if a curfew will be one of them, but I know the ""single shopper"" rule is coming.Edited: 3:36 pm, April 06, 2020 "
Maui has had its first official death from CV-19. He was a male resident.
"16 more cases today--the state total now is 387. Lower than I expected, to be blunt. But labs are so overwhelmed with tests I guess it shouldn't be a surprise..........we may see a higher number tomorrow or Wednesday, as they catch up.With the death on Maui, the state total is 5. One bad sign.....four of the new cases needed hospitalization (five if you count the death). I don't know if people are in denial and not getting care as soon as they should or what. But I do know that can mean they are spreading it more before they seek care.Maui's total is 44 now (including the 2 Moloka'i cases). Big Island and Kaua'i each went up by one, too. Oahu had the greatest increase, as usual."
Maui has added 4 more......we are now at 48.The state total is 410. 23 new cases since yesterday.
I had mentioned a hospital employee was infected a while back.Now we have had some REALLY bad news confirmed---at least 15 employees are positive........and not all the tests are back yet.
That is bad news SW.
"It is indeed. Like really, really bad news. The news releases are rather fractured.......but a couple of facts:  They are still testing employees and patients both. They confirmed that some of the employees worked in Hematology and Oncology. Employees at Maui Memorial weren't allowed to wear masks until March 31st outside of surgical procedures or intensive body fluid situations because there weren't enough masks.Suffice to say we could have our own pandemic within a pandemic.As for the daily report, the sixth death was reported in today's numbers. It was a Maui case. Not all the Maui Memorial cases have been included in the count yet; the current total for Maui is up 6, to 54. The state total is 435."
"Who was it who famously said, ""There are lies, and Damn lies""?? I may not have the quote exactly right.Anyways, I personally think it applies now. The DOH is now claiming the 15 Cluster cases aren't new....but were spread out over time, and there's not really anything to worry about..........ya' know, opening a separate quarantine site for these people is just kind of for fun.........it really wasn't a Cluster (I will resist editorializing that word)...........https:/…Sure. And of course that would be why they shipped 6000 masks in today and are testing all employees who had any contact with the 16 or so???? Just for fun, I guess."
"SW, kinda like ignore the man behind the curtain? Seems to be the response of “leadership “ at a lot of different levels."
"Yep, PK, that's what I think. Our mayor is pretty dang good at relating facts--not fiction. He and the Maui head of Dept. of Health had the same ""story"" as the Kaiser head......but suddenly 8 hours later the *state* people have a whole different song and dance?Not buyin' it. If the nurses I know and the docs I know there tell me the State was right, I'll happily say I was wrong.Edited: 10:41 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"The mayor gave in to pressure......I'm still skeptical of the party line, LOL.https:/…https:/…VERY poor management by Kaiser, IMO. No wonder employees are scared.For those who aren't aware, no more than 2 people in a vehicle for running essential errands........and random checkpoints are starting too."
"Funny enough, this is the first time in memory that policy is being implemented to promote the health and well being of the people of Hawai'I without regard to it's effect on tourism - except to bring it to a halt.What strange times in which we live."
"SWThe quote is 'There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"".It was Benjamin Disraeli, British Prime Minister in the 19th century"
"Thanks, Ducks!! I was way too lazy to look it up last night.And another article about the mess:https:/…I nominate Josh Green for Gov and Kawakami (Kaua'i mayor) for Lt. Gov. :-)!Edited: 4:49 pm, April 09, 2020 "
442 now.........only 7 new ones today. Very strange.
"KHON2 reports this morning that all vacation rentals on Kauai must cease operations including advertising.Mayor Derek Kawakami doesn't pussy-foot around!Maui Mayor Mike Victorino today ordered an 11pm to 5am curfew on Maui for the next 3 nights, bringing Maui county in line with Honolulu County's Mayor Kirk Caldwell's similar announcement yesterday.Edited: 2:12 pm, April 10, 2020 "
"Yeah, Mayor Victorino also ordered a cessation of vacation rentals in his announcement yesterday......but it's not real clear how long that is supposed to last.He also ordered people who sell food and/or have direct contact with the public to wear masks or face coverings, plus limited number of people to go shopping, etc......Here's a link to Maui Now's summary, from yesterday's press conference:https:/…"
"Over 700 drive through tests were done yesterday in Kahului--and they are doing more today. Hana is also having a testing event. So we can expect numbers to go up by Monday, if not before...The hospital denies any cover-up:https:/…And I was born yesterday :-(.Edited: 2:56 pm, April 10, 2020 "
"And four more cases from the hospital-3 employees and one patient. Another patient also died today there.....plus a death on Oahu. So we are at 8 deaths, 22 new cases--a total in the state of 464. So much for them saying only 7 cases yesterday was a sign that we were over it........https:/…https:/…The quarantine, stay home or lockdown orders, curfew, and ordering vacation rentals to close was all too late."
The total had to be amended......23 new cases--they miscounted Maui's total.Maui is at 66 and the state total is 465.The doc doing all the tests yesterday and today expected to complete around 2000 tests--awesome and very needed. We can hope for better numbers and more knowledge when those results come in.
"Maui had the largest increase.....14 new cases. We are now at 80. That is far from the end, unfortunately. We are in for a very bad time here.The state total is 486 now.Here's an update about the Maui Memorial hospital situation. As I said in another thread, the CEO should lose his job. It won't help those who are already ill, have or will die(d), but at least he couldn't do MORE harm. It is disgusting that he has harmed and jeopardized so many.https:/…I again beg people to NOT visit. We are rapidly running out of resources to treat the people already here, whether residents or visitors. We are going to see it get MUCH worse. STAY HOME. Come visit after this is all over. We can't afford you now or anytime soon.SW"
"From today's Maui News""""After requiring that bed-and-breakfast and short-term rental homes no longer allow visitors, Mayor Michael Victorino said Friday he is looking at eliminating rental cars for visitors to further deter them from arriving on Maui.“That is my next move,” Victorino said at his daily update on COVID-19."""
"I am glad he's *finally* considering it. It would make breaking quarantine more difficult, at least......taxis and ubers are pretty tough to find now and the driver might call the cops on you.Our state Reps have also asked for Ntl Guard people to do regular enforcement/management of our rural areas."
The roadblocks yesterday only resulted in 7 tickets.......:https:/…And a petition has been started by a courageous MM ICU nurse seeking the resignations of the hospital CEO and other top people:https:/…
"Only 4 new cases on Maui today.......mostly because the tests done over the last few days haven't come back yet. An update on Maui Memorial status is 22 positive staff and 9 patients....many tests outstanding still. They also still haven't contacted every patient who might have been exposed.Maui is at 84 total; the State is at 499. They also added a death yesterday that I didn't post about, which puts the death total at 9 now. Probably more deaths than that (like most places) due to people not being diagnosed or dying at home.Edited: 6:36 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"Our neighbor John N. Is a Physician's Assistant. He was asked today to join the staff at MMMC - Maui Memorial Medical Center. He has accepted.""Someone's gotta do it."" was his explanation to us."
"Wow......he's a good man :-). Like I said before, I think almost all the staff at MM is awesome. They've saved my life twice, one time was within the last year, once many years ago (12 or 13). They deserve the right equipment, support, and **honesty** from the Admin."
"A good and honest interview with Dr. Miscovich:https://www.kitv.com/story/41998574/dr-scott…warning us that due to the mess by MM Admin, we can indeed expect many more cases on Maui.Kaukau, tell your friend to have plenty masks, yeah?!"

"Copy that, SW."
"Listen to Mayor Michael Victorino's radio interview today on HI92FM as presented by MauiNow. https:/…He explains why Maui County's Covid-19 restrictions do not violate or infringe on our constitutional rights and liberties, and emphasizes how the nighttime curfew this past weekend applied to wheeled transportation only, and you could have, and can, leave your house anytime, day or night, to walk - your dog, or for exercise.I for one couldn't be prouder of the way our Mayor is leading us through this crisis.How about you?"
"I didn't like the crap with the $$$$ church.......otherwise, I think he's done a good job.Only 5 new cases today, according to Anderson. Obviously, all the tests Miscovich's groups did aren't back yet.We still have Quarantourists arriving all over the state. I guess HTA's request to stop marketing cheap flights didn't work with the airlines, huh?"
"No, certainly not, but Mayor Victorino's desire to restrict/deny accomodations and rental cars to non residents are efforts to make it not possible to book a Maui vacation at this time.What else can be done to halt tourism to Maui 'til this Public Health Emergency has passed?The Airlines' assertion that they """"Cannot discriminate against a passenger who wishes to travel"" is slightly disingenuous, as they routinely deny boarding to passengers who are drunk, disorderly, filthy, stink, etc. Capisce?"

"Yeah, not sure why he's being cagey--his letter to $$$church$$$ made it clear the second cluster was coming out of ""a church"".If the airlines were responsible for checking a person's lodging arrangements, that would be awesome. But they aren't-and I am sure they won't agree to police that either.I think restricting rental cars period is great!!"
"So only 13 reported today. Clearly the nearly 2000 tests done on Maui and Moloka'i recently haven't all come back.Only 2 new cases on Maui--we stand at 88. That supposedly includes one Kula Hospital employee and several other Maui Memorial employees, plus a patient (over the last week). Maui Memorial's head honcho is now asking Kaiser home office to send him experts. Great.Here's a link to the mayor's morning chat (I don't think it's been posted, apologies if it has):https:/…Edited: 6:16 pm, April 14, 2020 "
Here's a good article from Civil Beat about the hospital:https:/…
"4 more on Maui....and many results won't be back until Friday, as of last report. So we are at 92---but with a huge number of unknown test results still pending.The state total is now 530.They were doing ""drive by"" testing in West Maui this morning. They will be doing more in Hana and Moloka'i this week too."
3 more on Maui in today's report. Only 11 for the State...which just shows they aren't getting results back OR they aren't releasing the info promptly.
"Everyday at 4pm on AKAKU3 channel 55 in Lahaina on Spectrum, Mayor Victorino airs his 4. o'clock TV live update on the state of the Covid19 pandemic on Maui. It's on right now."
"Two new closures announce today.Hana is now closed to all but residents.All beaches are now closed except for entering and exiting the water and for fishing.Mayor Victorino announced today that two permanent checkpoints will be in place starting tomorrow to make sure only residents are traveling to Hana. One after Twin Falls on the front side one past Keokea on the backside. The checkpoints will be manned 24/7 by the National Guard and police.Governor Ige announced today that walking, running, exercising and laying on all beaches is now prohibited. Beaches may only be used to access the ocean and for fishing.Edited: 10:51 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"Thanks, Kaukau.......been crazy busy all day.We are at 102 cases now on Maui. And many tests still outstanding, plus more done over this week that haven't come back yet.Schools are closed through May (all graduation cremonies were cancelled a few days ago). The Courts also announced no trials until at least June 1st today......I think we will see the quarantine extended. Ige is a huge fool if he doesn't--and doesn't get some teeth into enforcement.How's this for ""respect"" and ""Aloha""???:https:/…"
"SWI just read the link you postedAnother idiot..., she had no place to stay... she should never been allowed to enter MauiNo respect for the residents ... glad she was found and sent backStay safe"
"Sadly, she isn't the only quarantourist acting like that. She just happened to make the wrong people (Waimanalo folks) REALLY mad. So they reported her and helped track her down, LOL.So, 21 new cases today. Only 2 new reports on Maui but we all know that's not including the results of hundreds of tests this week alone.The state total is at 574. Maui is at 104. The hospital cluster is far larger and worse that the state DOH people want to admit (and Kaiser as well). Not only at the hospital-but it spread from there to Hale Makua and also the Wailuku homeless shelter.Edited: 7:17 pm, April 18, 2020 "
The mayor is asking the Governor to allow exercising on the beaches and there is an online petition that has garnered 4000 signatures
A man from Washington died today on Maui. He had been in the hospital for a while. We also had 2 new cases.
They announced 2 more deaths a little while ago--one on Oahu and one on Maui. Both were older men.The Maui man was *possibly* one infected at the hospital. This isn't over......I can't fathom why people think it is. STAY HOME.
"I think we should all provide the death totals for our area.Since this started In Butte county 16 Covert-19 cases total with zero deaths.Edited: 4:19 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"You're so lucky :-).But this is about Maui.......and sadly, the info shows it's not safe to visit Maui right now. Travel will remain very difficult and Maui really isn't any ""fun"" for 95% of tourists right now."
"So Maui is now at 110 cases and 5 deaths. We had 2 more new cases today. Lots of test results still outstanding.The hospital cluster is at 56. They *think* that might be the total. I think they're being very optimistic. It started back in March and I think there will be more as more test results come in.I don't think we'll see any changes to lockdown orders or the quarantine on Maui anytime soon. But the quarantine is a State order---so it will depend how gutsy the mayor wants to be, if the guv drops it."
Butte county still at 16 Covert-19 cases with zero none no deaths.

"I agree with SW in that there’s no point in posting specific Covid stats from other areas on the Maui forum. There’s also no point in posting the Maui stats on a daily basis, on multiple topics. ~ Colleen"
"Colleen, I usually post the stats on this thread only for Maui, and on the Oahu thread for the state. Hardly ""excessive"", given the severity and seriousness of COVID-19............BTW, they are going to modify the Oahu lockdown orders slightly.Edited: 7:58 pm, April 21, 2020 "
So should we cancel vacation planned for Hawaii in July/August?
"Personally--my opinion only---I would cancel.I think this will continue for many, many months.....but personally, I wouldn't want to be traveling this summer anywhere. We are about a year away from a vaccine, and of course this can mutate like viruses do, as well. Once there is a better understanding of the virus and its ""habits"", once there are reliable test kits easily and readily available.....I'd feel better. But I think that is five or six months away.Even if Maui reopens in June, it will not be like it was. Many businesses will not make it, and many may be under strict limit rules or restrictions. I think recreational /tourist activities in July and August will be on a learning curve, for lack of a better term.Restaurants are a whole other issue.....and as I mentioned a few days ago, I expect to see many have to close permanently. So people visiting early on after the travel has cleared up may find that a detraction too.All of this is uncharted territory. Many people have no idea if they will have a job in another few weeks or not, or be going *back* to work in a hotel or tourist venue in another month. One reason it is important to keep track of the numbers is to watch for those patterns which can indicate progress-or lack of. We can look forward to less or no cases being added, soon-I hope...."
"April 17, 2020CALIFORNIA STATE MODEL PROJECTS 76 CORONAVIRUS DEATHS IN BUTTE CO. BY JUNE 1.Yet with increased testing no new positive cases have been reported in Butte County since last Tuesday April 14th. I'm not trying to down play the danger of this virus, but come on just a couple of months ago we were told 2.2 million Americans were going to die from this virus. Sounds comical now.Edited: 9:57 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"It could be 2.2 million if nothing had been done. It sounds comical (actually no, it does not, to anyone that lost a loved one it does not) because IT WORKED."
"Again, Fireball, I don't see the purpose in continually highlighting California (Butte County in particular) stats on the Maui forum. It comes across as intentionally provocative and antagonistic. And as mentioned, the ""potential"" numbers you cite were just that: potential. Worst case scenario, e.g. ""if we do nothing"". ButI think I understand the point you're trying to make so overtly. It's far worse in other areas than it is in Hawaii, even taking into consideration available resources. Truth. SW, I didn't frame your stat sharing as ""excessive"" (your quote).. I said I see no point in sharing the stats on a daily basis, on multiple topics. You could share it once per day and I'd say the same.~ Colleen"
"Yeah, it's all unicorns and rainbows in Hawaii!!!!Let's just ignore the people who died and those who are sick!!!! Who cares???? It's all perfect, go ahead, get on a plane!!!!!!Edited: 12:09 am, April 22, 2020 "
"Sorry, I'm new to this thread and was just asking if we should cancel our plans. Sorry if I offended anyone."
"You didn't offend anyone who takes this seriously.I hope my post to you helps some. It's a very hard decision. SWEdited: 12:19 am, April 22, 2020 "
"No one other than you has suggested “unicorns & rainbows” in Hawaii, SW. No need for hyperbole. Re a July/August trip: this summer/this year is a good time to dial down travel, given the unknowns. I’ve cancelled two trips and wouldn’t commit to anything else just now. But I’m open to options as things develop. Who knows?! ~ Colleen"
"Then why is it wrong to inform people of the current situation, Colleen? Or should we just ignore it? Or is it just too much fun to criticize me....since you said I shouldn't post any info?People don't know. They have no idea how things are here. I and a couple of other people post the info. People shouldn't be planning or coming to Maui now. Please, stay home.Edited: 12:42 am, April 22, 2020 "
"It’s not helpful when you exaggerate and misrepresent, SW. I didn’t say you shouldn’t share info, nor did I criticize you. I stated plainly that I don’t see the point in ongoing daily “stats updates”. ~ Colleen"
"And why not? Should it be once a week? Or once every three days, or 3 weeks? You and others don't have to read this thread. I have tried to help people for 6 weeks now. I haven't seen much help from some of you."
"For those interested in the human side, there are news releases about the last 2 deaths.Very sad, and perhaps reading about the men will make it real."
"Don’t misrepresent what I’ve said. And do NOT suggest that those who disagree with you are less aware or sympathetic. Just don’t. Hearing about the day to day, the boots on the ground firsthand insight, is helpful. I don’t believe people considering travel, to Hawaii or elsewhere, are swayed by the fact that 3 people (for example) were diagnosed yesterday. ~ ColleenEdited: 2:43 am, April 22, 2020 "
"Right. Whatever, Colleen."
"This was our “off” snowbird winter for Hawaii, and came back from Australia on April 1. We spent the last two weeks there self-isolating in Darwin (although there were no community transmission cases there in all of March.) It took 3 flights to come home. Unfortunately, despite wearing a mask, wiping down, washing hands per protocol and all of that, I was infected during the journey. We came back to strict quarantine measures - which was a very good thing, as I could have spread it around unknowingly otherwise. The first symptom was a massive headache that lasted almost two days. Only a low grade fever for a couple of days, gone by the time the tight chest and cough started. Incubation would have been roughly 3-5 days from the first to the last flight.After a very scary trip to our local Covid Assessment Center, then immediate referral to the ER, I was sent home to a prolonged quarantine.Luckily, my lungs stayed clear, but I’m still totally wiped. I consider myself very lucky indeed. The Covid section of the ER was a different story - I was the oldest person there by at least a decade or two, and the least sick (I had to be additionally screened to rule out another PE.)Getting on a plane *anywhere* is a bad idea until this is beat... I went from a “safe” place (the Northern Territory locked down early) straight into quarantine. So getting from Butte County - or anywhere else - to Maui runs the real risk of bringing more cases to Maui. I am now proof of that. At least at home, I’m familiar with the community resources here and I have a network of friends that have been crucial in helping us cope with the quarantine. I did not need hospitalization, but I don’t have the energy to do much, like cook.So, for the “to cancel or not” questions, here’s my answer: cancel.If you get infected on your way to Maui, and your first symptoms develop there, you will need to access medical care on Maui. You, and ALL of your travelling party, will be put in strict quarantine in place. You will not be allowed to fly home until symptom-free. You will have to figure out how to get food and the logistics of extending your stay. Insurance may or may not cover your extra costs. No one will be allowed go out to use an ATM, buy groceries, go for a walk, etc.. Your support network will not be there for you. If you develop Covid complications or have more than a mild case, imagine what that would be like to go through away from home.Then also think of how many people could be infected by you, or one of your asymptomatic travel companions. We were three that travelled, then quarantined together: 1 sick, two not."
"Thanks for sharing here, FTW. I’m glad you’re on the mend, but you’ve been through the wringer. Your story points up how insidious this virus is, and how exposure can be so impactful. It’s astonishing how many people seemingly have no qualms about embarking on air travel as soon as they can. I’m really worried that summer vacations and efforts to get back to “normal” quickly are going to prolong the agony. Ugh! Thank you again for letting us know how this has played out for you. Best wishes as you get back up to speed.~ Colleen"
Scientists in China (if you can believe anything they say) have identified more than 30 mutations of the Covid 19 virus. This will really impact the ability to identify and the effectiveness of a vaccine.https://www.foxnews.com/science/coronavirus-…
"Thank you. I think we'll wait and see and possible cancel in June, although that makes me sad."
"FTW, I am so glad you are getting better! What a horrible experience. Take care and keep healing......MJ, it's hard but FTW's story is so important. Come to Hawaii when this is over or at least much more under control and understood.Here's an article about one of the Maui victims:https:/…Note that he was in the age group with the highest number of cases, in Hawaii.Edited: 11:49 am, April 22, 2020 "
Colleen my posting of Butte County Covid stats is a mocking gesture to point out that not every Original Poster on the Maui Forum needs to be reminded not to travel to Maui at this time or an up to date death count.If I want the latest Covid info about Maui it's easy to find here cause it gets bumped to the top of the list daily by the op.
"Though there haven't been any confirmed cases on Lana'i, testing will be done there on 04-25. This is part of the plan to proactively test **many** people and get a better picture of our County's status. Getting more and more tests done proactively will help the mayor and crew to decide about lockdown orders, quarantine, etc. It is also in accordance with CDC and other experts' recs.Like the head of the Maui Health Division said, ""If you test more, you will find more"". That sounds bad until it helps map out the caseload and patterns."
"Our mayor has indicated he expects to extend the lockdown orders through May....or most of it. There may be *some* things allowed to start back up, but you can bet they won't be major ones.He has promised a more complete statement by Friday. He's trying to give the guv a chance to do the right thing."
"6 new cases......but none on Maui. 3 each for Oahu and the BI. Most of the Moloka'i and Hana test results are back--and were negative--great news!There was a fascinating study done on the WA. patient zero. It was published in the NY Times, if people are interested. It examined the surprise discovery of just how many cases he is most likely responsible for."
"To all the people complaining about updates to this post, why don't you just pass it by? An honest question and I'm not trying to be combative. Just don't read it. Simple really."
"Ugh, Maui Now update.... involving Merrimans Kapalua:https:/…"
"Yeah, thanks to Lolo Pang, this was misstated to start with. I'm glad Merriman's released the info. I ate there during that period and am fine :-).....along with some friends and some neighbors who also ate there during the week in question.I don't get why they haven't publicized Leilani's and Hula Grill's cases. Those were in the end of January--and may have been the first cases in Hawaii overall. Kind of important, ya' know??? But the employee responsible was working through to March when they finally shut down......hello?????"
"Thanks, Cindy! I wouldn't have expected to get sick, since Merriman's had told employees to call in sick if there was ANY question....which the 3 did. Management made it clear they would support employees who did the right thing.If only Kaiser had treated their employees the same way :-(((."
"I saw someone mention the Leilani one yesterday somewhere. These restaurants are so busy... its scary!Glad you are OK! We stopped going to Leilani's and Hula Grill years ago, food is too inconsistent, and service even worse! I'm happy you are OK SW, and your friends! --Lori"

Too bad the stupid employee at Maui Memorial didn’t know better than to go to work sick. What planet did they think they were living on?

Then there's the guy from Washington via Vail---who came to Maui to ""escape"" the virus in Vail...........and brought it with him. He died the other day.

SW I know you're dying to hear my Van Halen story. It's so good I don't have to embellish like I normally do.
"That employee thought of no one but themselves. Didn’t someone post it was a doctor? Dh has only been working in a hospital for 3 years but knows better to go in sick. It’s part of employee training, including doctors on staff. Even before a pandemic. There are social services on Maui that would have helped instead of causing the largest cluster of the virus on the island. There are no excuses."

"Four more cases today. 2 more on Maui.I don't know, fish--like I first said. I agree there are no reasons, but plenty of excuses. Good or not......sigh.One month ago, Hawaii had 77 known cases. Today we have 596. That's not a great rate , but Anderson and some others are slobbering to 'reopen the state' :-(."
"LoriNo, but does not surprise me. Thunder Valley and now the New Hard Rock Indian casinos they've killed gambling in Reno."
DH was chief engineer at the Shops at Wailea in the early 2000. They used to shut it down for exclusive shopping once in awhile. Had to chase paparazzi out of trees trying to photograph Brittany Spears. I told him why bother?
"An old friend of my family's died this past week. It was COVID-19, but the DOH is still deciding that...though it was what she was hospitalized for and with.Another old family friend is still in Maui Memorial--and is one that got it there. She is struggling and the outlook isn't good.Many lives on Maui have been affected by this, in more than financial ways. Being so small, almost everyone I know has connections to people who either have had it, had it, or died from it.PLEASE don't visit Maui now, or soon. You can't do anything for 2 weeks (and yes, people are being checked on here during quarantine). If you stay longer than 2 weeks, you still can't do much....and things are closed all over. Still food shortages as well as cleaning/disinfecting items too. Prices are going up like crazy on food items in the stores.........every week more things go up by a buck or so. Given that some people are predicting a major food shortage worldwide by fall, that prob won't stop anytime soon. Gas is cheap."
"So, I finally read this report https:/… about the Covid-19 cluster at Merriman's. (And didn't see that it was posted about upthread when I initially posted here) Does anyone know what kind of contact tracing they did? My family ate there March 14 (implied in the article that the impacted workers didn't work there that night). No one has contacted us, and would be easy with the cell phone number they have from our reservation. We've had no symptoms in the intervening time, but am now a little surprised I hadn't heard anything until today.Edited: 10:42 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"SW trade restrictions are breaking supply chains, and coronavirus lockdowns are preventing laborers from working on farms. European governments locking down their borders not allowing migrant workers to come in to do the work is a big problem. England is asking unemployed to pick strawberries and cut asparagus.There's plenty of food it's economic and political reasons why it isn't reaching countries that need it and causing issues in Hawaii."
"Stewart, my understanding is that the close contacts were tested. When none of those were positive, the DOH said no wider net was needed. I ate there as well,as I said....and wasn't contacted either.Remember that the people who were later confirmed did not go to work during the time you were there. They called in sick.If they infected anyone it probably would have been at least a week before. But no one else tested positive.Edited: 11:49 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"Tyson, Smithfield, and other major producers shutting down is affecting many places. Cases of the virus are nothing to mess with in meat packing plants. We have been experiencing food shortages here since this started, and it's not really going to get better. We are last on the list for many items.Produce varies widely. Some is newly arrived, but clearly old--wilted, moldy, soft. Meats---well, good luck. Try almost 8.00 a lb.for ground beef---if there is any. Dried goods fluctuate; sometimes you can get them, most times a skinny selection. Liquid dairy is the same---good luck, cause it's a crapshoot.Edited: 12:12 am, April 24, 2020 "
"Smithfield is owned by wait for it..........WH group out of Hong Kong formerly known as Shuanghui Group. How ironic a Chinese company owns an American brand that's having issues with the virus.Your food supply is also being effected by the lack of commercial sales associated with the shut down of restaurants and resorts on the island. It all goes hand and hand. Shutting down and sheltering in place has certainly saved lives to date you have 12 reported, but at what cost? Is the cure worst then the disease? The numbers are starting to reflect that millions of us have already been infected by covid. We certainly believe that in California. Three of my staff in December had flu like illness that would have been considered for covid testing today. One of them had visited Germany upon arrival became ill and infected the other 2. In our area we're already witnessing civil disobedience businesses are not obeying closure orders and are reopening. I commute 120 miles round trip a day. A month ago there was no one on the road. Today the roads were packed.SW if things are as tough as you've reported how much longer will the general population put up with empty shelves and inflation? Are you feeling the frustration? When will they push back and say enough?It's coming......"

"We only added one new case today........we are at 113 (for Maui). There were 2 more deaths of older men on Oahu. The state total is 601.The tests done in Hana have all come back negative--really, really great news! Shutting it down has made a huge difference.Edited: 5:58 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Here is a rundown from Maui Now of the new procedures for people arriving anywhere in Hawaii. Since there's really no doubt about the quarantine being extended, people might want to consider the new policies/procedures carefully before coming:https:/…It should start on Maui within a few days. People who want to break or ignore the quarantine rules might find themselves in much more difficulty than they expected.I still wish they'd prohibit tourists from renting cars for the 14 days. No reason for them to have one."
"So SW is renting a condo prohibited now? That's what I understood from the article, that short term rentals are not allowed. Is that the case? Not planning on going to the island now, but dreaming of fall...Edited: 3:52 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"Cris, it was a weird thing.......no one on any island had really said a word about short term rentals until Caldwell (Oahu) did a few weeks ago. He suddenly said they were prohibited because they weren't an 'essential business'. Boom--every other island mayor jumped on the wagon with him.So, suddenly-yes, they were xxx'd. But I think there are a lot of questions about that. Like what about condos rented like hotels, by Outrigger and Aston? You and I can't rent ours in the same complex-but they can-or not? If they can rent any condos, why can't someone else, or another ""agency""? And what makes hotels 'essential' for Quarantourists---but not condos?The new procedures seem to plan on legal condos being okay. I think perhaps the powers above decided trying to enforce no short term rentals would be impossible and open to legal challenge. So it specifies a ""legal"" short term rental. That's interesting, too....and will just lead to the old fake ""I'm staying at my sister's house"" or ""it's my brother's house"" lines (which is what illegal places tell tourists to say).Edited: 4:09 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"3 new cases today, all on Oahu. For some reason (not explained), DOH subtracted a case from Maui. Perhaps they had the wrong island for one of the new cases. Anyways, Maui is at 112.Gas was 2.39 a gallon yesterday at Costco. Most of the smaller stations are still 3.70 or so. Several have closed over in Central.....whether permanently or not remains to be seen.Lots of really awesome fundraisers/local food raising efforts going on here. I won't post them since it could be taken as soliciting, but it is just wonderful to see so many people/groups/businesses/government departments do so much for those in need :-).Edited: 8:40 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"As expected....quarantine and lockdown extended through May 31st, by the guv.Beaches are again okay to walk or run on--NOT sit or sunbathe, though:https:/…"
"Here's an interesting photo essay from the Maui News:https:/…which shows both pros and cons of CV-19 in some stark ways.Being older than a dinosaur, I remember when beaches looked like this--and it wasn't all that long ago, LOL. Maybe 25-30 years. ......and of course roads did too, but they weren't big wide roads like the two shown!I also remember that banks closed at noon on Fridays. Period. Gas was sold by the litre on Maui for many, many years, too. Seemed cheap until the tourists read the pump properly-oops!We will see many more people being reported/turned in for violating quarantine now. Locals are pretty fed up with the Quarantourists. Many have been really awful to deal with."
Two new cases today--one each for the BI and Oahu. The State total is 606.
"Only one new case today,another one related to our hospital :-(. So Maui is back to 113 total.2 more deaths also. Both were on Oahu."
"Only 1 new coronavirus case in Hawaii, bringing statewide total to 619 https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/01/br…"
"Plus another new one today, on Maui--620 total for the state, 117 now for Maui.Numbers have def dropped....but it's the weekend too. Test results are slower every weekend.Beach parks opened up again, for exercise only. Some interior parks opened too-same thing. No picnics, lounging, hanging out--only active play or exercise. It's a start, though.Masks are required for all people in businesses and when in outside areas occupied/open to other people.A Texas jackass got put on a flight back to TX after violating quarantine several times......just like some other idiots on other islands.The hospital outbreak is at 59 although the admins there claim that's too high. They say 2 cases (a Maui Medical group doctor and a Lana'i resident"" shouldn't be included. Riiiiiiiigggggghhhhhhhttttttt."

"Here's an update from DLNR about State Parks with open/partial open/still closed info:https://www.kitv.com/story/42082002/dlnr-beg…As I mentioned in another thread, remember the Road to Hana is still closed unless you have a permit. Haleakala also remains totally closed."
"2 new cases--one each for Oahu and the BI. A new death on Maui as well..They discovered a ""double counted"" case on Maui and on Oahu....so Maui's number dropped to 116 from 117. I'm not sure they know which way is up half the time at DOH.Though not on Maui.....the 37 year old bartender who was one of the first public cases is finally recovering!!! 6 weeks in ICU................but he is now able to breathe almost 11 hours a day on his own."
With my stimulus check I'm going to buy 2 ferrets guess what I'm going to name them.Wrong!I'm going to name them Oahu and BI for the Big island.
Here's a story about Coby Torda (the bartender I mentioned above and before):https:/…Such a cool story!
621 cases as of yesterday.....no new ones on Maui though!Here's a good news story about the DOT and airline route suspensions:https:/…
"Four new cases today, all on Oahu. Nice to not be in the numbers for a change!The guv did agree to allow most retail to reopen Thursday. I posted about that on the Quarantine and Lockdown thread."
"And the Muppet changed his mind last night....no retail reopening now:https:/…He is so incompetent. The damage he does is substantial and causes trouble for many, many people."
Sounds just as bad as our president!
Hardly a fair comparison. Gov Ige may waffle but he does have a brain. He has genuine empathy of others and doesn't bully or call his constituents or the press names. He also doesn't think he is the king of the world. He also doesn't spend the bulk of his time criticizing the opposition or hours on twitter.
"From Nick's loaded posts, he sounded bad. Sorry for the horrible comparison!"
"My posts are my opinion , LOL.......and I stand by my assessment/opinion of Ige. He has fumbled so many things (missile alert, anyone?) and just continues to fail in leadership, clarity, consistency, and *communication*. His failures lead to stress and expense for businesses, people, county governments, and more. Can you imagine how the hotels and airlines view him? What will they do when he says he's dropping the quarantine (he is considering that, BTW)? Will they jump in and call employees back........or wait to see if he says ""Oops"" again? I bet the latter."
"As expected, parts of Makena (Big Beach) are reopening. Poli Poli is as well:https:/…Limited hours and no gatherings, lounging..........and sorry, but Little Beach remains closed."
"Dang it, I was ready to lounge naked........ ;) Thank You SW for the updates.... your Guv talks more than ours. Ours speaks to the public once a week!--Lori"
"I thought you were going to go do the drum circle, Lori! Ah, well.........next time, huh?Our guv should be quiet. He can't get things straight and his confusion hurts everyone......."
Just one new case today--on Oahu. Good news!
So 3 new cases on Oahu...and another day without a new one on Maui :-). Such nice news for us here.6 quarantourists from California 'deported' yesterday...........Buh-bye!
For the first time since March 13 no new cases of COVID-19 reported overnight in Hawaii. The total cases here remain at 629. Almost 90% of patients confirmed to have the virus have recovered. The death total remains at 17.
"Yep, good news for sure....if only tests were real time."
3 new cases today. One on Maui.
"So, one new case on Oahu today. The Oahu total is 408. Maui is at 117.The State is at 632. Keeping fingers and paws crossed for more low numbers :-)."
Maui is still at 117. Oahu has had several new cases over the last few days.The State total is 638.
"They took one off the State (well, Oahu) total. No new cases on Maui again--very good news!Here's an article:https:/…and also one from an interview with Lt. guv Green:https:/…"
"Thanks SW. I had seen the interview, very informative. I encourage others to watch as well.It seems things will not go back to what they once were, for better or worse... They are gearing to really change the economy from being so dependent on tourism, and stick with a reduced number of visitors for a long time or forever. Things are really going to change!!Edited: 9:44 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"You're welcome, Cris!The mayor has finally given in to pleas and we will be allowed to sit on beaches this weekend.....if the next 2 weeks go well then that will stick.The guv said the quarantine will run through June 30th."
"So in addition to being able to sit on the beaches, as I posted last night----hair salons/barber shops can open later this month--and restaurants can on June 5th.Obviously, the rules for these operations are *strict* and complicated. Not sure how many restaurants will try to do it."
"Listening to Good Morning Hawaii this morning:"" At last check more than 87,000 people have lost their lives in the U.S. due to COVID-19 in the last weeks.""- With 17 deaths here in Hawaii, we are truly fortunate."" The head of the CDC on Friday has projected there will be at least 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 in the US by the start of June as restrictions are eased in all but two states: none of them reporting meeting the phase 1 recommendations of consecutive 14 day drops in the number of new cases. 4 States are reporting increases in the number of new cases"".The program goes on to cite numerous examples of a spike in new cases in the states that are ""opening up"".This makes me believe that as Hawaii slowly gets back to business, it's the incoming arrivals quarantine that is keeping our rate of infection the lowest in the nation.Carl Bonham from the UH Economic Research Organization said ""That while tourism will still be the State's major economic 'export' we have to develop other areas where we're exporting everything from food to software to clothing to (his) personal favorite, beer, and all of those will help.""He goes on to say it could be years 'til our economy gets back on track to levels seen before the start of the Pandemic. It is a fact that there will be will be a long period of Economic Darwinism here in Hawaii where the strong will survive and the weak will perish and you can blame that on a microscopic virus, not anybody's intentions. The other day County of Maui Mayor Michael Victorino touted the success of a Maui-based company manufacturing ventilators who has orders from as far away as Maine, Texas, and the United Arab Emirates."
"Bonham's interviews have all been very interesting, haven't they?We are still holding steady at 117 total on Maui......for about 8 days now. That's nice news, even though we will of course have more cases.If people behave and don't mess up the 2 week trial for the beaches, it will be great!"
"And as posted in another thread, the quarantine for ALL arrivals has been ""officially"" extended through June."
Here's a cool little article about a flower drop at the hospital today:https:/…
"I have posted a new thread, since this one is getting kind of crazy long :-). Here is a link:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29220…SW"
