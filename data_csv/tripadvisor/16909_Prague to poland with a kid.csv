"Hi all,We're planning to travel with our 5 year old in August. We thought to land in Prague, rent a car and travel all the way to Poland, spending about 5 days in Moravia, traveling between villages and picturesque little towns (we prefer nature and small valleys with local cousin over large cities, with museums and zoos).What locations would be advisable to visit?Is it a good idea at all considering the construction works on the high way from Prague to Brno?Should we be worried about the stories about the measles epidemic in Europe we read in the press?Thanks!"
Measles epidemic? First I've heard of it!
