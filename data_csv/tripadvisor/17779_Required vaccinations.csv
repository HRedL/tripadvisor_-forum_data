"I'm travelling to Rwanda this year and really confused over which vaccinations I need, especially Yellow Fever.my travel agency has said I need this along with a card. I've been to a travel clinic who says I don't need it? Rwanda tourist board says I do.Can anyone help me please?"
My travel clinic here in the US said I need it. The CDC says you need it in certain circumstances:…cdc.gov/travel/…rwandaand the Rwandan government says you need it in certain circumstances:moh.gov.rw/index.php…
"It is compulsory and good for you. However, Rwanda immigration some times does not ask for it."
"Can you provide the site that indicates ""compulsory"""
"Hi,I am a local tour operator based in Rwanda and Yellow Book is compulsory to all visiting Rwanda. Sometimes,you can get the Yellow Book at the airport / boarder but its not reliable you better get one before travelling to East Africa.Safe travel!!"
"Hi, thank you for your response. You are 2nd tour operator to say I need this, however, the Rwandan department of health is saying I don't need it as I'm travelling from the uk, which is a non-epidemic country, I'm still unsure of what to do?"
"@ anadapookyCan you talk to any official from Rwanda immigration.What i know, they used to ask for the certificate and now a days, they are not strict."
"As of April 17, 2016, yellow fever vaccination is no longer required if coming from a non-epidemic area of the world.Below is an official letter from the Ministry of Health in Rwanda.https:/…Instruction_on_Yellow_Fever.pdf"
