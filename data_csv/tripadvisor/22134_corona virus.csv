"hi there, turkey comfirmed there firstCoronavirus."
"Yes, A long way from Oludeniz which will not be fully open until the beginning of May.More cases in the U.K at the moment."
Hi I am booked to go in a weeks time.I was looking forward to it but of course now am a bit concerned.I will go as all is paid for but half of me wishes flights would be cancelled.I'll go armed with antiseptic wipes and throat lozenges.I will make the holiday as good as I can but all the signs do not look too good!I reckon all of us due to travel might risk being sent home quarantined or worse.It's all very scary..

I just hope you remain fit to fly out there. Far greater risk here (for now at least!)
Linden have you seen the confirmed figures here today compared to just one person in Istanbul? I would say you are certainly a lot less likely to catch it in Turkey than you are here. And the Turkish people are probably not exactly over the moon either about us Brits visiting their country when the amount of cases here is rising by the minute.
I am going to Alanya from Birmingham on 19th March.I cannot help but regret that we all have a nasty virus lurking around.I think worry will maybe cause people to cancel.It seems Turkey is perhaps also going to stop some events where many gather.So it says on the Web.
I thought I was posting on the Turkey forum made an error .
Yes you are posting on the Oludeniz Forum which is a holiday resort in Turkey.Here is the Alanya Forum link. Where you should post.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g297â€¦
