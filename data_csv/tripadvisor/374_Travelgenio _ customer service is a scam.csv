"Hello,Beware of travelgenio, they have no customer service and therefore they xill not tell you when your flight is cancelled. I sent 15 messages during 3 weeks but they never reply. Do you have any advice to make them reply? They owe me 500€ and I have heard that the only way to get a reply is to take a laxyer"
"Hello, did you send an email here: Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com ?"
"Unfortunately, they have no obligation to tell you your flight is cancelled. Neither do airlines. Contact them via Twitter or FB. If your flight is cancelled, they must get the money back from the airline before they can return it to you, minus any fees they may charge.Next time, book directly with the airlines."
"Rather than start yet another Travelgenio thread you could have looked at one of the existing one, found the contact details of the Travelgenio Bot/Rep and made contact with them that way. How many Travelgenio threads do we need?"
"what flight was cancelled? did you do this or was it to somewhere in china?but, if you are not getting what you paid for and are legally entitled to a refund, dispute the charge with your cc company !"
I'm the TravelGenio Bot.....please use an existing thread to insult me.....
"You're not the Travelgenio bot, you're a very naughty boy.Or:""I am the Travelgenio bot.""Two ""in memoriams"" for the price of one!"
"'I sent 15 messages during 3 weeks but they never reply. Do you have any advice to make them reply? They owe me 500€ and I have heard that the only way to get a reply is to take a laxyer.'I'd have stopped trying to contact this awful company after two or three messages, and they're not likely to reply now.Since you've provided no information about the cancelled flight (as Travelgenio was the airline's customer the airline would have contacted them about any changes; that they couldn't bother to pass on messages is their standard operating procedure) then speak to your credit card supplier and let them deal with this useless website. Alternately pay a lawyer who will ask you if you've contacted your credit card supplier.'I'm the Travelgenio bot and so's my wife!' One more box ticked."
"Thank you tripbob8 for your feedback. To review your case in detail, please could you write to us at customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the details, so we can check what happened?. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards."
"Yay, the real Travelgenio bot has surfaced. Better catch it before it goes under again.Edited: 6:06 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"Yes it is. I just contacted them yesterday. My flight was cancelled due to virus spreading in china. I tried to change my flight with their costumer service representative. Funny thing is that I was said that I had to make call to QANTAS by myself to make changes. Obviously, I am not retarded knowing that my agent (Travelgenio) must cooperate with airline where they booked the ticket. More funny thing is that the costumer service representative says there is no policy to make change and I required to talk to manager. The answer was that there had never been manager, that was she said, then after out of nowhere she said the manager would not talk to costumer and made laugh to me then hung up the phone. WHAT THE FU*K WAS THAT. IT IS JUST SCAM!!! PEOPLE, NEVER BOOK WITH TRAVELGENIO. A day before, I was supposed to be received e-mail from customer.service@travelgenio.com regarding my post on this forum. But still I am waiting for their response. Hope it could reach to the manager who has never existed!!!"
"We have a dozen threads here with thousands of posts warning about this company.I wish you luck with your refund, but next time PLEASE research before you buy from a lousy company"
"bilguun b, mails are replied in about 24-48 hours. You will receive a reply asap. Thanks in advance"
"So biguun, have you heard anything yet? If so, has Travelgenio done anything for you?"
"Is the travelgenio replied here is a bot? it seems almost same on all forum. I left another 72 hours before my departure (flight date : 21st March 2020). However, it seems no future to be cancelled or get refunded by them.Booking Code Travelgenio: 16992040Booking Code Sabre : HPIBXDIf I did not get any refund process, I will try my best to file a fraud case report on the company. Hopefully, they will not do this to others. Really disappointed."
Did you get any resolution on the matter? Did they give you the money back or a voucher? Thanks.

"Hi, I need an answers ASAP , my flight was scheduled this Saturday however the flight was canceled for air Canada due to coronavirus . Please someone resolve my request.. I need a confirmation that you will refund my ticked.Thank you in advance for your attention and help.Best regards,"
Doubtful. As far as I know Air Canada are issuing vouchers. Not sure how that works when you booked from a 3rd party. I would not expect a resolution any time soon.
Thank you for contacting us Valverde. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days. INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"Do NOT Book from this site, they are so DISHONESTI have made a mistake twice from booking my trips from this site. The first time back in March, I had to call in to cancel because of the Virus since I knew the place I was going to would have a lock down. They let me but I was not refunded the full amount as they said some of the fees could not be reimbursed. Sure that was fine. The second time for a trip in April and at the time there was no lock down yet and since they were still selling I thought it would be safe to go ahead but a week before my trip, I got a notification from the airline that one of the connection flights got canceled. I called the actual airlines and they said everything was canceled and since I was booked through travelgenio, I would have to call them for the full refund. I started to call Travelgenio a week before my trip, the lines made me wait for at least 20 minutes each time and hung up on me, and through one of the recordings, clearly stated that if anything related to COVID 19, they only deal with it through to form on the site. I went on and filled out the the form requesting my refund but noone responded to my email. I called again and again . Two days ago i called and finally got through, they said because the trip was old they had to request it to view. today after 5 times of getting hung up on them, I tried different option from the line, the guy pick up, and he told me since it was an old ticket, he had to request it to view and asked me to call back after 24 hours or 48 hours. After 5 attempts today, someone finally picked up and it seemed like it was the same man i dealt with few days ago. He made me wait for 15 minutes on the line and he came back on and told me they are not responsible for the refund because it was a past trip and I did not call to cancel and told me to deal with it with the airline even after I told him i called the airline and been trying to reach them the past month. I asked to speak to the manager and he wouldn't transfer and at the end he got fed up with me and hung up on me. I was already patient enough to call and waiting so many times and thought I would give them a break because nobody wanted this to happen due to COVID 19 . At this point it's not about the money for me anymore but it's about the honesty of the business and professionalism. They are so tricky, if you call and pick option number one where it said if it's related to Covid 19 etc.. and after you choose that option, it lead you to another message and hung up on you. the only reason why i got through because i felt i had to trick them to think i was there for booking instead of refund due to covid 19etc.. I""m disgusted and I will never book through this site again and I hope everyone reads this because apparently I'm not the only one who is being cheated."

"Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Please contact us via the contact section of our site and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
tth: too bad you didn’t research this dreadful company before you gave them your money. There are threads here going back many years warning you that their service is horrible in normal times. In these conditions you can only pray that you see your money.Next time research FIRST before you give away your money
"Hello everyone,Hope all of you are doing well.First of all I've read most os these messeges and it is horrible what they are doing and im surprised that no one can stop them.So i booked a ticket in Travelgenio and druing 12 hours i recived an email that my flight is canceled but they didnt give me a reason why my flight is canceled. I tried ti call them as i found one of the numbers in different sites and they don answer,I wrote an email to them for refund still no answer.I reallu dont know what to do if anyone has another option to help me please help me please!!"
"dellza, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"dellza, there's a good chance that the airline cancelled the flight. It may have even been cancelled before you booked via Travelgenio. If you look the flight up via the airline, does it show as available? Moving forward, I suggest booking directly with the airline and not these third party ticket sellers"
"For months I have been trying to contact Travelgenio and the phone line hangs up after a few minutes and the email address contact comes back saying that they do not recognise the booking number - even though they won’t accept an email unless you put the booking number in the subject so it has priced impossible to co tact them. They ask you to put in your email address that you used to make the booking on their contact form and they send a link to your email address and you click on the link and you go to my trips and your booking comes up. For weeks when I checked it said that they were waiting for airline approval for the refund but now when I put in my email address when I used to make the booking when contacting them it doesn’t recognise the email address and not only that but when I go to check the original booking that I made last July it says that the information doesn’t exist on their server. So basically it seems that Travelgenio keep all of your information on a server when they contact you and then they just wipe the server whenever they want, leaving no proof of any emails they sent to you. My booking has basically vanished off their system. Booking id 14968687. I’m due a refund if 2800 for flights from Dublin to Vancouver that were cancelled in April. Very distressing. The email address for their customer service also doesn’t work and this is the email address that they keep telling everyone in the reviews (ie Trustpilot) to contact but you can’t send an email to that address because as stated above, they ask you to put in the email address you used to make the booking when contacting them but then you get a reply to say that the email address doesn’t exist. And from today, funnily enough, an error message comes up when you try to send an email to their customer service email address saying “this email cannot be sent”. Have they gone bust? Seems like it to me. All I want is a booking invoice to give to my travel insurance company and I can’t even get that. So distressed. The worst company I’ve ever dealt with in my life. Will be filing a complaint to the aviation authority."
