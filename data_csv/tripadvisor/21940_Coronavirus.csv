Is there Coronavirus in KL
Thank you
"Yes Dear, we have more than 100 cases"
Australia just imposed a 14 day self isolation period on ALL entrants from anywhere outside Australia including Australian citizens.Travel is not a great idea at present.Just work out where you are most comfortable to spend the next few months and bunker down IMO.
We just got back today from Malaysia. The airport didn’t tell us to self isolate or anything. Didn’t even take our temperatures NOTHING AT ALL!!! There’s more precautions in Malaysia as Australia doesn’t seem to be doing anything about it in my opinion.
Ban comes into affect at midnight AEST. Similar ban in NZ.
I am cancelling my trip to Europe - so sad .....as el dorado said only announced today 14 day self imposed quarantine

Are there still plenty of tourists in Malaysia? I don't feel like my trip should be cancelled. Are people still out and enjoying the great city that KL is?
There are much lesser tourists than usual in the city now. I just came back from hosting guests around the city. Batu Caves & Thean Hou Temple are much quieter than usual. Usually I could spot several tour buses by the time we get down the temple at Batu Caves around 10.00am but this morning there were none. There are tourists in the area but mostly coming in smaller groups possibly by Grab or the Komuter train.The elevated walkway from the Twin Towers to Bukit Bintang was deserted last night too. It was usually packed on weekends with people walking in between the two shopping districts. Especially since this week is a mid-term school holiday break in this country too.Cases have doubled to more than 400 now but mostly due to a religious congregation at a mosque about a week ago. The authorities are transparent so we are not panicking albeit still some selfish people hoarding staple items at the supermarket but luckily tissue paper is not really a big thing in this country as we use water bidet/ spray most of the time :-) Most supermarkets are generally well-stocked and most staple items (including face mask) is price-regulated in this country so there is no issue of people jacking up the price to make fortune out of the needy.

"Post #11, you don’t feel like your trip should be cancelled?? So you don’t mind risking contributing to the spread of this disease and potentially infecting others more vulnerable?Anyway looks like the decision has been made for you and rightly so. Very selfish to be travelling at this time."
nothing happening here. You be wasting your time and money unless you like to walk in empty streets and building and eat on take aways for every meal.
