So Portugal is off the list for the time being from 10th july till......? Doesn't anyone know how often they review this quarantine. No one will care unless they are going to the states Sweden or Portugal lol
"I think I read it was to be reviewed every 3 weeks, but on the FCO travel advice it says it they will keep their advice under constant review. Whatever happens it's too late for our flight as Tui are no longer showing it on their website for sale and I'm sure it hasn't sold out! I don't know when they're planning on letting me know but the last holiday I had booked with them took 3 months to get a refund. I wonder if Sturgeon will let me across that border to visit my family in Scotland instead?"
It's pretty pointless planning ahead when those who know what's best for us change their minds every few days. I shall shortly be cancelling three flights booked (last December) for later this month and will no doubt find out the day before that I could have gone.
"""those who know what's best for us""? A very dangerous assumption. I was a great fan of Pelham G Woodhouse in my youth. Boris reminds me of Gussie Fink Nottle (the newt man) or perhaps Bertie himself."
Unfortunately we all know who is Jeeves in Borisland .
"Hi, We have flights blooked to Porto with easy jet on 17.7.20. A house booked in the country side for a week . Followed by an apartment in Sao marinho do Porto. We have booked it all independantly and its all paid for. We have had to fly from Gatwick now instead of Manchester. You can't see the flight on the website. When we rang easyjet they said our flights are still on. The resort is open and the want us to come. Our flight is due back 31.7.20. I'm still not sure what to do. Our insurance is through the bank account. My husband can self isolate with the children on return and I may be able to. I am worring as the holiday cost a lot of money and if the flight is still on I don't know if we can get our money back."
"I read this onlineThe UK’s travel advice is due to be ‘reviewed’ on July 27, though efforts underway are focused on changing the situation for visiting Brits even sooner."

Today's figures not good news 443 new infections in Portugal.They should be going down .
I just saw the figures and my heart sank. This is not good news. Although the majority are Lisbon and the North regions. 13 more positives in algarve.
"Exactly Nikky Something is not right, higher cases in the Algarve can only be down to the relaxation of travel within Portugal..My neighbour who manages properties is getting cancellations every day when this will not help.Edited: 11:43 am, July 08, 2020 "
"I called Easyjet earlier and was told to expect an email next week offering either a voucher or a refund if we didn't want to travel, if the FCO advice is still in place. We are due to fly on 28th July. The flight is still going at the moment.Obviously no promises but we're going to hold out and claim on our travel insurance if we don't get anything back from Easyjet directly. No promises though unfortunately. Hope this helpsEdited: 11:51 am, July 08, 2020 "

Except cases in the Algarve have risen.Anyone asymptomatic can still pass on the infection..Today we get the latest theory that the virus can be airborne.We really do not know enough to reach a conclusion one way or the other.I have two close friends who each lost a parent to the virus do I am more than prepared to follow the advice ..
"Terry R, it hasn't helped that so many workers in the Algarve come from Brazil. They are having terrible times in South America at the moment and it appears until fairly recently they have been allowed into Portugal Pretty much unchecked. I am sure this is a factor for Portugal not being in the list."
There is no evidence that the virus is a result of Brazilians.In fact out of work Brazilians returned on rescue flights in the early days .The virus was far more active in Spain long before there were any border controls with Portugal.The earliest Algarve cases were as a result of individuals who went to Italy skiing.
"Terry, why have they the Portuguese government been allowing flights from Brazil into Lisbon & Porto, when they know Brazil have a high number of infections and the majority of infections in Portugal are in the areas of Lisbon & Porto. I'm just very sad that I think this virus will be with us for a long time until they can find a vaccine and personally I really don't want them pumping the sh*te of it in my veins if they end up make it mandatory."
The UK allowed 100s flights into Heathrow.What we know now we did not know back in March. When we finally know the history of events we will find that the virus has been active for longer than originally thought. Cities around the world have and continue to be hotpots some that have little to do with Brazil. The virus went to South America it did not come from there.
"I’m due to fly early August. Booked flights to Porto with Ryanair (still flying) and accommodation through various sites (non refundable).I don’t want to go, so I’m hoping the Foreign Office advice stays in place and I can claim on my insurance. If the government change the advice I lose everything I’ve paid for.Edited: 5:26 pm, July 08, 2020 "

Fingers crossed it gets lifted - Me and the missus have managed to get a week off together in August and would love to spend it in Portugal.
You really think that the government knows anything
“ n fact out of work Brazilians returned on rescue flights in the early days “Not just the early days Terry!
How Portugal is doing https:/…128_DGS_boletim_20200708.pdfHow Spain is doing https:/…Actualizacion_158_COVID-19.pdf
Terry they could see it coming across Europe so had a good heads up and because we have a dithering leader with a tendency to miss cobra meetings he did nothing .
No evidence of a flood of covid infected Brazilians causing the rise in Portugal.Thats. Daily mail thinking
"I wasn’t suggesting they were the cause, only highlighting the fact that flights from Brazil were continually landing in Portugal. Diaspora"
"""Daily Mail thinking""An excellent example of an oxymoron."
"Could not agree more, however compared to the Express the Mail is a paper not quite to the right of Genghis Khan."
Today's infection rate in Portugal 413.I have seen a post Jet 2 have cancelled all flights for July ?
"Jet2 have indeed cancelled all flights including to Spain.The daily infection rate is not as important as the 7 day rolling numbers as they show a far more accurate account of the rate of infection.Edited: 12:41 pm, July 09, 2020 "
"Let's see what EJ and the others do .We were in Ferragudo this afternoon, fairly busy but few very few Brits on holiday.."
"Thanks for all your replies. K.R, Catherine"
"Hi, I'm booked with Jet2 flying out on the 20th July from Glasgow. I have just had word from Jet2 that my fligh is scheduled to depart as stated."
Could you please tell me where you purchased specific travel insurance for your trip to Portugal? The £59 per couple one? I am looking for same. Thanks!
@Adrian E - Could you please also send me the details of the cover you purchased?Thanks in advance.
"Just post it, I don't see that there is anything wrong with doing so. I'm sure if it's not allowed, then TA will simply remove it."
"Hi. I posted the name of an insurance company that are advertising as providing cover in the event of cancellations due to COVID on the Menorca forum and didn’t get any flack. As you are not self promoting or advertising and it is valid travel related info I think it should be fine. Presume you are not giving an opinion, just saying the name of the company?"
"BBC news, no evidence of any date on which Portugal will be removed from the quarantine list.Serbia has been added to the quarantine list..."
Could you re message me? Sorry haven’t received anything from you but thanks so much for replying
what has Serbia got to do with the albufeira forum???
"John , i saw the same item on the news as Terry and the reporter was talking about Portugal and he mentioned Serbia as a country where they were added to the list at the last minute so it showed how quickly things can change . I think the guy was giving people who want to go to Portugal a glimmer of hope ."
Serbia was originally on the list of places you can go but has recently been downgraded.
I wouldn't say a glimmer of hope as the numbers rise in Portugal but knowing the uk government they will add Portugal to the non quarantine list and I suppose why shouldn't they as numbers as I said before are going to rise in every summer destination till countries start closing down their borders and we will be back to the days when sky news are showing people trapped on their balconies and cruise ships offshore imprisoned.... and then comes the winter flu...Happy holidays everyone
"John, you live in a stunning country. Why not explore what’s on your doorstep worry free?"
"William, you are correct I do live in a stunning country and as a delivery driver I have seen my stunning county every day and having lived in N Ireland in various stunning towns I think I have seen enough to appreciate it, my reason for going abroad is to get some sun on my back but to have the worry as you put it, it would fill me with dread to be omitted to an Algarve hospital not being able to go home for maybe many weeks or to have my hotel closed down with me in it not being able to leave or flights cancelled by the irish government from faro then the need to quarantine when home with no money coming in.... so again Hppy holidays"
Interesting letter in the Portuguese resident Paper.https:/…
"by that account it should be the Portuguese banning the british, there should be a law that at airports staff should be made to wear masks but as for gloves I think this gives a false sense of security as the virus can still be passed on through contact you would have to clean every time you touch anything(phones passports) so to say at least they were wearing gloves would not build me with confidence as then the gloves could be worn for hours without being cleaned"
"According to the Uk press, Trailfinders might also be with a look for Covid cancellation cover."
"Is compliance in Wales the law or is it merely 'guidance' or 'advice'?A town centre management company surely has no force in law even non compliance was illegal. In Portugal it's the law. Yes some people ignore it, but risking arrest, fines and possibly a court followed by a night behind bars.If this virus (or any other virus) is shown to survive on gloves and clothes, then abandon hope.I am reading that masks, 'social distancing' and the associated restrictions may be with us forever, with the annual winter influenza outbreaks in mind. Will the population as a whole stand for it? Local media reports a 70% drop in holiday bookings in the Algarve. If the world stays as it is, there will be hardly anywhere here open for a holiday this time next year.Meanwhile, the battle to get British holidaymakers here resumes with this tongue in cheek opening shot :-https:/…"
"That's ok if you're flying from England. Unfortunately my husband and I can't do that as our First Minister has also banned travel to Spain from Scotland.We have changed three flights so far from March. We're due to fly out on 21st but will obviously not be going - yet again. I phoned my holiday insurance company today and was told that I would not be covered for Spain or Portugal until the government give the green light. Now, as a UK citizen I hoped I could pack my bag as soon as Boris gives ""permission""....NO . I have to wait for Nicola to allow me to go Portugal and throw out the butter and cheese in my fridge!!"
"Forget the U K. There's no such thing with covid. It's country by country. The English (where covid is concerned) Government still hasn't quite got the message. Probably still contemplate their lost empire.Those returning from Spain and Portugal and going on to Scotland will be subject to 14 days quarantine & checked on a % basis. No matter which UK airport they return through. Once their numbers improve that will change, but not before. I hope it's soon but we don't need to import cases.Edited: 10:07 am, July 10, 2020 "
"Latest update, 418 new cases.The last 3 days all over 400.They need to come down substantially and stay down."
One thing for sure is they are not gonna go down...
For Portugal's sake I hope they get it under control soon but it isn't easy. After 4 months we look as though we're getting numbers down but it's a very fragile improvement. Look at Melbourne.
"Terry, again, daily figures mean nothing, it’s the 7 day rolling figures that count."
If you Look at the 7 day rolling average you will see that it is sadly increasing.The last 3 days have been over 400.
"Over 400 cases but not in the Algarve.https:/…The overall numbers are still miniscule, The 'retransmission' rate in the Algarve is 0.81, lower than the rest of the country, Abut half the recorded deaths in Portugal have been in the far north of the country, a rather disproportionate number given the population. There have been no deaths in the Algarve for five weeks now. 98% of those who have had it in this region have completely recovered.The thing to do is to stay at home, lock the doors, draw the curtains and remain there until it goes away.Certainly do not travel, anywhere."
Unless Portugal bans internal movement stopping anyone from outside the Algarve driving down it has to be about Portugal.
"The precautionary principle must apply. The Algarve is not a separate country, only a region. There is at times considerable movement between t'north and south. Sadly the Algarve must suffer for the slack behaviour of northerners. The Portuguese government must get a grip of the situation as other countries have done. No amount of fulminating against the unfairness will change that. No one wants to spend their hols. in a foreign hospital."
Absolutely. I get the shivers everytime I drive pass portimao hospital. It looks like a prison. Plus the algarve doesn't have enough specialist doctors and nurses. On the plus side carvoeiro was rather busy last night. Not many British accents though.
Excluding the 2000plus kids in Albufeira the Dutch seem to be the dominant non Portuguese nationality here at the moment..
At last cubsur is seeing the dangers of covid19 this will not go away any time soon...
"#72, I think his post was said very much tongue in cheek"
“Absolutely. I get the shivers everytime I drive pass portimao hospital. It looks like a prison. Plus the algarve doesn't have enough specialist doctors and nurses.”Is there something wrong with Portimao hospital? Does it have a bad reputation? Is there really a lack of doctors/nurses?
"First reaction to today's figures b*,, ** hell.Todays figure over 540 new infections."
"Absolutely agree, we ain't going nowhere. We are following the guidelines as much as possible, we now even sleep under our bed and with our masks on, also when making out we keep our masks on as per the latest CDC. We are doing our best to keep everyone safe."
Wandering star. Thankfully I have never needed portimao hospital. So I can't tell you about its reputation. But I am so pleased we have private insurance and may never need to go there. It really does look like a prison. Google the images.And yes. We have a lack of specialist doctors and nurses in the algarve. There was a story in the news recently. The algarve has lots of ventilators but not enough doctors and nurses to operate them.
Terry I already said the numbers will rise so no surprise and how many Spanish have crossed back over the border having feeling symptoms and don't want to be stuck in Portugal......
I’m in the same boat but I called my travel insurance and essentially we can get a full refund because as long as the flights are within 28 days of the “no go” list you are covered. So call the insurance as long as you are within 28 days.
Adrian could you please send me details of insurance that you booked for Portugal please?
Disregard my last message I hadn't seen this. Thanks.
Let's get this right. There were an extra 200 cases added to yesterday's number due to uncounted tests. The actual number was 342. https:/…
So that means on those 3 days mentioned in the report the total was underestimated. It’s as broad as it’s long .
Please could you also send me details of the travel insurance. Thanks
Adrian posted the details of his insurance in post 53 of this thread.

"Just read this article ....what the heck is going on ? Portuguese business’s are desperately wanting tourists , tourists are wanting to go to Portugal particularly the Algarve on holiday but can’t because of what the UK decided. https:/…54818Edited: 5:56 pm, July 12, 2020 "
Hi can you let me know where you got your insurance?
obe see #53 for full details.
Portugal has extended the restrictions in parts of Lisbon until at least the 28th July.This does not bode well for any change in the UKs travel restrictions to Portugal.
"Young Brits are tearing up Magaluf, etc right now ... maybe Algarve has just found some luck .."
Thank you so much
#91. The policía and guardia civil are set to crack down hard now. This will not be pretty and heads will get broken.
My Ryanair flight from Porto to Krakow in 6 days just got cancelled - they quoted government restrictions.Are these restrictions on the Portuguese side?How long will they remain in play?
"There is nothing to stop people leaving Portugal. I have noticed that there are still no flights into Portugal from Scandinavian countries as well as Poland, so it must be a reflection of their decision, presumably because of their quarantines, not to let people in flying from Portugal. I wonder if there any checks if you travel by rail or road?"
"Just had a customer on my rounds tell me their is a group of lads from Tralee coming out on Saturday with the main aim to catch and spread covid19, they have tshirts printed up with initials s.s19 standing for superspreaders, glad I'm not out there...."
"Hello Terry R.Could you tell us what they are doing on the beaches of Ferragudo? Are they observing social distancing and have they opened the beach bars?Best wishes,Sarah"
Where are they staying..?
"97,Ferragudo very safe , it's a huge beach so no problems finding your own space.Our favourite bar is Kalu , very laid back , genuine beach bar.Nau has music on Sundays , gets very busy , popular with expats.There are a number of restaurants in the square who do very good value lunches."
"Qualityspy, she didn't know, idiots"
Thanks so much for replying Terry. We absolutely love Ferragudo. My dad lives in Portugal near Alcoutim and we have been coming to Ferragudo for the past few years. Kalu is our favourite too...where my little girl loves to hang out and chat to everyone working there. I am wondering if it will be a good idea to come this year in August and whether there are outbreaks in Ferragudo.
Looking at a week in Praia de Rocha in March. Fingers crossed there is a little more normality by then.
96* John C. Well I hope they get their cum-uppance for their stupidity and the GNR fine them heavily if they cause problems. Gee whiz some folks have no morals or respect for this pandemic and think its a complete joke. Shame on them.
"No evidence of any outbreaks in Ferragudo.Alcoutim is one of the Algarve best kept secrets , hope it stays that way."
"Hi all!Nicola Sturgeon is reviewing the situation with all countries at the moment - a press call is due for 20th July when she will announce any changes to travel restrictions, which should include updates on Portugal and Spain where Scotland is concerned. Not sure what the situation is with England, Wales and Northern Ireland but I would imagine is going to be similar to Scotland. Hopefully, it will be announced that there is no need to quarantine on return from Portugal and we can travel freely to Albufeira! But that's the date of the update announcement on travel so keep an eye on it and hope for the best."
Jayjan let's hope they misbehave and get kicked off the flight
"ha, yes lets hope they do. Hopefully they will get wasted before boarding and refused entry onto the plane . Or either arrested by the GNR when they arrive due to misbehaviour on the flight. Complete Morons."
Just when it looked like things were improving latest figures 375 new infections.
"I repeat STAY AWAY from Portugal if you are concerned about the situation here. There is nothing anyone can do to influence government decisions about quarantines etc. This virus is not going to go away. We must learn to live with it.Four in every thousand people in the whole of Portugal (0.43%) have been confirmed to have had the virus since January. Just over two-thirds recovered completely. Many of the rest are on the list, but will still be recuperating in home or in hospital if serious. The north of the country has had a disproportionate number of cases per head.There have been 750 cases in the Algarve during that same almost 7 month period. That equates to about 0.17% of the population. Compare this with where you live. You decide the additional risk.The number of cases is those tested positive having felt symptoms. People may carry the virus without displaying symptoms. There is no national testing scheme and even if there were, who's to know whether it has been picked up since a test.As a further measure, arriving air passengers will be now fined €2000 is they refuse to have the temperature test at the airport. (Those coming by car from Spain obviously are not a threat!)"
Yes Alcoutim is beautiful.Thanks very much for the information. Hope Kalu will be open for business.. it’s such a seasonal business that it breaks my heart to think of how hard it must be for them.
"I plan on coming this weekend as planned. The Irish government will be releasing their “green list” on Monday and I’m hopeful they’ll include Portugal, due to the numbers being mostly in the north and Lisbon,but who knows. The way I see it, our hotel is set on a wide open space and operating at a low capacity so social distancing will be easy to maintain, and the restrictions like mask wearing are enforced which is also good to hear. I’m coming from Ireland which apparently has the lowest COVID rates in Western Europe and I’ve recently gotten a positive result from my Antibody test after having the virus in March. Really looking forward to being back in the beautiful Algarve."
"Read the following in the Portugal Resident today re testing - Fines up to €3000 for airlines transporting passengers without negative tests.  "" In other words, it is now mandatory that anyone arriving in Portugal from the United States, Brazil, or any other non-EU/ non-Schengen space countries must be in possession of a negative molecular RT-PCR test (standing for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test) for SARS-COV-2, taken in the previous 72-hours"""
A lot of controversy around the RT-PCR tests for showing false results in both directions.
This constant comparison between the Algarve and the cities of Portugal is pointless.It's numbers were much lower because Portugal was on lockdown and no one other than the Portuguese residents and some expats were here.If you really do want to focus on figures those in the Algarve have increased with freedom of movement and higher visitor numbers.The Algarve is not an island just a few hours from the areas of higher infection.It is those numbers which will determine when Portugal moves onto the no quarantine on return list.Mainland Portugal s numbers and only Mainland Portugal s numbers
Freedom or freedumb?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3PSISAZL8I go with the later.
probably explains why they have at least 150k fatalities !
"EJ still cancelling flights for what is normally the height of the season.Had our 5th August cancelled this morning, that's the 4th cancellation to date."
"There must be some demand ... all hotels are maintaining their usual high prices for first week in August ... formerly one of the cheapest, Hotel California, now £160 per night ... or maybe they have all decided not to pitch for the `usual` Brit customers who wont be there ...Edited: 7:47 am, July 16, 2020 "
"One flight day , not every day instead of up to 3 flights a day by Easy jet from one of their busiest hubs does not indicate people queuing up to book flights does it ?"
"My post was not about your posts, Terry ... neither was the original post .."
"Obviously Pryman you have not connected the dots.The collapse in UK tourists, the on going cancellation of flights is down to the continuing uncertainty over if and when the quarantine on returning UK tourists will be lifted.49% of arrivals at Faro are from the UK."
Hopefully quarantine won’t be lifted for another month at least.
"At least, just look at the behaviour of young Brits in Spain ,the last thing Portugal needs is any relaxation of regulstions and travel restrictions from the UK and an influx of pond life such as those causing the problems."
"Terry, the problem being those who are ignoring the rules etc. will more than likely ignore quarantine rules. From what I'm hearing, there are few if any actual physical checks being made. Anyone can just give a mobile phone number as point of contact.As usual it's those who would abide by the rules who are being penalised and are also in the majority not visiting, even though there is nothing to actually stop them doing so.Edited: 11:27 am, July 16, 2020 "
There was a uk family in a bar in carvoeiro last night. Just arrived and I asked if they were going to quarantine on return. Absolutely not he said!
Nicky they are the sort of people that will travel without insurance and then create merry hell when something goes wrong 1
Oh they definitely had that attitude and had to be told every time to put the mask on to go to the loo. The kids had a strop.
"Nikky .... so you can imagine those type times a few 100. #123 Terry , I seen the video from Majorca , theIr behavior was unbelievable ! Pretty sure the Algarve can do without that , tourist money or not !"
"Portugal News , now gives July 31 as the next UK review date.Does anyone really know what's going on."
Not necessarily all UK at the same time.
"I thought 27th July announcement for England but as JockMcKay says could be different for Scotland or even Wales & Northern Ireland. We will see when it happens, if it ever does."
"""Does anyone really know what's going on.""Of course not! Governments, especially UK governments, are terrified of making a 'wrong' move. Look at the ludicrous recent decision to make wearing masks compulsory in English shops from next week. In other countries this has been the case since April or May!Having been a civil servant, I can agree with the sentiment that the preoccupation is to avoid making a decision and therefore any subsequent blame attached when it proves wrong."
"Personally I think this is something we all need to get used to for the next few years. Rules getting lifted then reinstated, quarantine, mini lockdowns, travel restrictions etc. If everyone is sensible and doing there bit to help then the quicker we get through the other side. Hopefully!"
"Won`t be back to anything like normal until we have a vaccine and most people have been inoculated. On a personal note, I hope the vaccine is not found until late November at the earliest (sorry to those suffering) because that idiot in the Whitehouse will claim he discovered it etc etc and many gullible Americans will fall for it and re-elect the worse President (imho) since Nixon,Anyhow, we are hoping to be in Albufeira from 8th September, vaccine or no vaccine, quarantine or no quarantineEdited: 5:13 am, July 17, 2020 "
"looks like boris Johnson is going for the herd immunity after all, you might not need all those brussel sprouts after all, you talk about covidiots he has got to be the biggest, I remember a president saying they will be singing in the churches for easter......how is that working out for him"
"Re vaccine if they ever find one, wonder whether it will be mandatory. If not I won't be having one, been ill enough ( worse than having the flu itself) off normal seasonal flu vaccines. They keep changing the strain which does not agree with everyone and no-one warns you about this at the doctors before having it.. All a money making racket for those in question in my eyes."
Approaching 750k families wouldn’t agree with you jayjan
Was smallpox a virus? Didn’t they eradicate that eventually.
"Ryan air cancelling 1000 flights during July and August, blaming quarantine policies.We had our 4th EJ cancellation to date and it's only July.Ref 137, Jaylan, once a vaccine is available it will probably be mandatory to carry a certificate before being allowed to travel.No vaccination no travel..Over the years we have had to various innoculations before being allowed into some countries if having previously visited others .Edited: 4:12 am, July 18, 2020 "
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52565764Vaccine? No thanks ! Agree with Jayjans post entirely as I’ve experienced the exact same end results.
"It may not be compulsory to be vaccinated but if you want to travel a different matter.We have had to have smallpox boosters, yellow fever, typhoid, cholera, hep A jabs over the years when travelling .Without them we could not have entered some countries.The future of travel will be very different for the foreseeable future."
Good point terry
Is Terry aware of something that no one else is?
Showing a negative Covid test before travel- a possibility Mandatory Covid vaccine before travel- highly unlikely
"William, should in the e future the UK open its borders to unvacvinat4d travellers from countries witha record. high infection and death rates from Covid.?.I suspect there are some who want one rule for others but not for that rule to apply to them ..Smallpox was defeated by global vaccination.I remember that arrivals from the Indian sub continent migrating to the UK had to prove that they had been vaccinated.No vaccination, no entry to the UK..."
Smallpox and Covid 19 are two entirely different diseases and should not be compared.As Covid allegedly passed to humans from animals then to eradicate the virus every human and animal would need to be given a shot.
"When was the last time you or anyone else you know went to a Chinese wet market , now being banned and ate an infected bat.Vaccination against Covid will reduce that risk if you do fancy a bat tartare for lunch.."
Missing the point Terry.
Smallpox could only be passed from human to human which is why a global vaccination wiped it out.Covid can be passed from animal to human as it’s a zoonotic disease therefore a global vaccination would be pointless as it would still be present in animals and could mutate and spread again via the food chain.Not necessarily from eating bats.I have seen a video of a Chinese vlogger eating a bat and I personally didn’t think they looked very appetising!
"So Don,t bother vaccinating and stay in Scotland while those who do can travel again."
"I will be travelling again without a vaccination.Your post is rather derogatory as I only explained the differences between smallpox and Covid.As usual you get argumentative when Someone else takes the time to offer an explanation.But by all means if a vaccine comes available you can stand in line for it but I won’t be.Would rather travel with a certificate stating Covid free if necessary.Ps. Could travel tomorrow with no problem and quarantine for 14 days but I choose not to.Edited: 7:59 am, July 18, 2020 "
"There have been an average of 10 new cases per day over the past week in Algarve ... which would be equivalent to 130 per day in Scotland ... almost 1500 per day for England and Wales ... only a complete fool would remove the quarantine any time soon. For those travelling, simply follow the rules and stay safe .."
How will you travel William if a vaccination certificate is required before you can travel.One thing the world has learned from Covid is that the freedoms of the past are well and truly in the past.
"I don’t lead my life with “ ifs” Terry, I try to stick to facts.At the moment I can travel but choose not to as I feel it’s far too early and will re evaluate the situation next March as I am more than happy to stay in a relatively safe and nearly Covid free Scotland, the most beautiful place in the world!"
i;ll be first in line for the vaccination.
I'll be right behind you Jock....... :-))
"Just for the record I am not knocking those who would choose to be vaccinated. Like Jayjan, my body doesn’t react very well to the annual flu jab which I have not taken the last few years and luckily remained relatively healthy."
"Still over 300 ,, yesterday's cases in Portugal .."
What areas Terry?
16 in the Algarve. An increase..But areas are irrelevant because nowhere in mainland Portugal is isolated from anywhere else.This weekend Lisbonites and others from north of the Algarve will be here in large numbers .
"mmmm, makes me wonder whether those areas in the greater Lisbon district who are supposedly on lockdown will stay at home or venture down to the Algarve for their annual holidays. I can see the Algarve numbers rising if they do.."
On lock down does not mean travel prohibited and anyway there is no way of preventing anyone leaving those parts of Lisbon where enhanced restrictions apply.Restrictions thst have been extended for another two weeks.
Not just the UK but an article in the Irish Times also suggests that Portugal will be in those countries whose travel status will NOT change to the Green list when the next review takes place in Ireland on Monday..
"Hi Adrian, my husband and I are flying out to Portugal on July 27th and are in the process of trying to get Travel Insurance . No-one will cover us as it is against FCO advice. I see from your post that you managed to purchase some. Could you advise me how to find a company that will cover us against for travelling against Gov advice ?Thank you so much."
135 new cases today its going down fingers crossed
Exactly fingers crossed its. Not just a weekend blip. .The majority still in Lisbon where the enhanced restrictions are.
"I wouldnt be too sure of figures on a Monday ... they show no new cases in Algarve .. after 33 cases in the previous 3 days ... and they have over 1600 cases waiting laboratory results in Portugal ... which may not be open on a Sunday .. Algarve is one twenty=third of Portugal`s population .. so those 33 should have indicated maybe 750 cases nationally, unless the rate is now higher down here ... can that be true ?"
I guess they class that as essential travel
"Portugal has not been branded unsafe, that just tabloid rubbish.Travel to Portugal is permitted on condition that visitors quarantine on return.That is not an unsafe country is it.Unsafe means no travel .The issue travellers face are 1) having to quarantine on return , 2 ) obtaining comprehensive travel insurance.Edited: 1:17 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"As long as Ireland continue to tell us that we can travel for essential reasons only without quarantining on return, then as much as I deem my holiday ""essential"" it looks like we won't be able to go. Also there is no chance of being able to get travel insurance if we are travelling against current advice. Obviously we are gutted that we may not get our holiday but I would not like to just chance it as things are so up and down in so many countries at the moment. I would feel extremely safe travelling to Lagos knowing that we would take all precautions as we do at home, but then we have to rely on others to do the same and that doesn't always happen. We hope that we will get to support all the restaurants and other business's in the Algarve but travelling against government advice just doesn't make any sense."
"Hello all, I'm after a bit of advice if anyone can share some much needed knowledge...Myself and my girlfriend have rather foolishly booked an upcoming trip which is made up of the following flights.Manchester -> PortoPorto -> GenevaGeneva -> ManchesterWe stupidly didn't check the rules for entering/leaving portugal and are now a little concerned... we will only be in porto airport for around 8 hours before we get on out flight to geneva (our target destination). All flights were booked separately. Just wondering if anyone has had any experience flying into portugal recently and even better if anyone has had any experience flying from portugal to france!Many thanks!"
"Geneva is in Switzerland so you would need to check rules between flying between Portugal and Switzerland, not France."
"#173 As all flights are booked separately, you will not have protected connection and could possibly be faced with cancelled/delayed flights. Perhaps have a plan ready, as there are a higher number of flights being disrupted at the moment. It's very unlikely that your travel insurance will cover you for any cancellation claims due to CV-19, even high risk insurance companies, are not accepting related cancellation claims. Good luck and yes it's Switzerland not France!Edited: 4:53 pm, July 21, 2020 "
According to safe communities Portugal. Ireland has left Portugal off the safe list. Let's see what boris does next.
https:/…Couple of lines here suggesting Portugal will be deemed safe next week. No direct quotes but hopefully it's a good sign....
Remember decisions are not set in stone. If the Portuguese situation deteriorates the quarantine can be reimposed. Interestingly the UK is not on Ireland's green list. We are unclean!
"Portugal s borders are open to anyone coming from EU countries with growing higher rates of infection.In the next few weeks 100s thousands will cross into Portugal, many coming to the Algarve.The UK will be taking that into account."
The Algarve might be getting an airbridge from monday. The uk government are going to take a more regional approach rather than making a country have to stick to the quarantine rules.
"So says the press, not the UK government.What's to stop UK tourists in the Algarve mixing with Lisbonites , Spaniards from Spain's centres of growing numbers..Regional "" green "" areas will just not work, the virus does not read road signs or Airport signs.The press originally reported that Portugal would be on the OK list.They got that wrong did,nt they."
"You are a bore most negative person on here.Edited: 10:22 am, July 22, 2020 "
Please post one fact in my post that you can contradict.I only worry about things that I can personally affect. How ever many times people say this or that will change it does not matter because it is outside of all of our controls..If the UK changes it policies then we will deal with it. If it does not we will also deal with it.
"Terry R, I used the word ""might"" for a reason, as the original poster had asked about when quarantine might be reviewed.As this was just publicized from the media, I thought it was at least a positive possibility."
"The media have got very little right since the very earliest days of the virus.The last source to use as a reference these days is the media..Today's number in Portugal 252 and increase of 100 from Monday's and Tuesday's.Edited: 11:44 am, July 22, 2020 "
"The media have still got more right than Boris.Boris,who ,with his band of idiots have stabbed the NHS in the back. https:/…Edited: 12:13 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"The Times now reporting ""Air bridge to open up Portugal holidays likely within days"""
Not the most reliable source William even if the message is correct..
More reliable than the BBC Terry who obeying there masters rules (gov) failed to report it. Always cast my net far and wide when in comes to info.
William it was in all the papers and on the news.
"Will b , I didn’t think you were a fan of the media as they use unnamed sources for a lot of their articles ."
"Oops! Thanks Terry, am obviously 3 days behind the rest of the world this week!"
Most news is propaganda in some shape or form Georgie. It’s down to the individual to filter out the lies from the truth which to be honest would probably leave a newspaper with 4 pages with 3 of them dedicated to sport.
"TERRY T what is wrong with you? people on here are trying to have civil conversations are you are like an annoying fly, you talk about the press this and that and facts but on your post 164 it was the irish times said this and that which in there was indeed not a fact in the article but you were quite happy to post the press"
"Tell me , what has happened regarding Portugal and Ireland.Was the Irish Times right or not.Has Portugal been listed as a quarantine free destination by Ireland..You can wish for an end to Covid restriction every minute of every day but until those in power make that decision you are just wasting your time and emotion..I want the quarantine on return to end.I want Portugal to retain its current restrictions on places that can open, social distancing, opening times etc..I do not want to see the mass return of tourists , just look at what is happening in parts of Spain where this has happened."
"mmm, Terry we will see what happens next when the thousands of Lisbonites & other Northern Portuguese who will invade the Algarve next week which could surely make a rise of infections in the Algarve. Plus still allowing flights in from Brazil (which is highly infected) into Lisbon & Porto. How irresponsible can that be to try an elveiviate the spread of the virus.Edited: 6:36 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"Terry, many of the increased outbreaks in Spain are not linked to tourism. The areas with some of the worst outbreaks are down to home grown cases, wedding parties, seasonal fruit pickers etc. Your borders in Portugal are still open and unrestricted with Spain. Maybe that should be a concern?"
The same papers that were suggesting the end of quarantine on return from Portugal were also suggesting the Spain could be added to the quarantine list because of the rise of cases in Spain.
"The press were indeed suggesting that yesterday. But, I repeat, the spikes that are occurring in Spain are not down to mass tourism, that is my point. It is down to home grown cases and movements of Spanish people across the peninsula. The Balearics and Canarias, where we have experienced mass tourism, have some of the lowest contagion rates in Spain. In contrast, Lleida, a heavily populated industrialised area which has very few tourists is in real trouble. I would just like the facts to be correct."
"Quality,It's the same in Portugal , but unless you effectively lock down infected areas, prevent all travel there will always be a risk.It's not just about tourists visiting areas of high infection but residents of those areas visiting tourist resorts.Better to have restrictions in tourist areas that make them less attractive to those looking for nightlife and late nights..Looking for crowded bars, clubs etc. Tourists but fewer tourists,.Edited: 4:12 am, July 23, 2020 "
"TERRY T wroteYou can wish for an end to Covid restriction every minute of every day but until those in power make that decision you are just wasting your time and emotion..... what I don't do is live my life on tripadvisor 24/7 unlike yourself, have a nice day trawling through those papers and news feed"
"Ignorance is not bliss.Information, whether you like it or not allows us to deal with whatever life throws at us..When we flew out here in mid march there were people on the plane who did not know what was happening in Portugal.The restrictions in place and those to come.They were just coming out to play golf for a week.We're they in for a shock."

Why are you posting this on everything?
"Today's figures another increase 290 infections, Portugal is following the trend that we are seeing across much of Europe.."
This is only going to go one way globally in the next few weeks and that isnt down !
Bbc just had a brief breaking news saying anyone going to or returning to Germany will need a negative test. Anyone refusing a test gets a 25k euro fine! Nothing on any of my news apps yet.
If true thst will have yet another negative effect on the Portuguese holiday market..
"@209And that’s after plane loads of tourists got flown home early on Monday to the uk.Edited: 12:12 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"Just read about it,17th August is a new update x"
Where did you read it.To date the press forecast have been 100% wrong.Infections are rising across Europe and have risen in Portugal in the last few days.
Three counties in Ireland now in lock down due to increasing numbers of people with infections.
Will quarantines be required when the winter 'flu season begins?
in the winter they will just call it hibernation.... this is going to be a long winter usually go to lanzarote nov cant see that happening.
#214 Probably will. The symptoms of Flu & Covid are so similar that it'll be impossible to tell them apart initially. As both attack the respiratory system a double infection won't be good. So why risk importing more infections. I appreciate this will cause problems for holiday destinations but we have to look after number one.
"214 , no as Covid is 10 times more fatal than flu ."
"Over the week to August 7 ... 263 new cases in Scotland, where they are starting to panic and lockdown a few areas .... 28 new cases in Algarve, equivalent to 336 cases in Scotland. Why would they review quarantine anytime soon ?"
"Figures have worsened for week to August 8 ... 305 new cases in Scotland .. 49 new cases in Algarve, equivalent (x12 population) to almost 600 cases in Scotland .. I think we should expect worse still ..."
"It's not just the total number of cases in Portugal that will affect any UK decision.The Algarve is where the vast majority of Brits will travel. An Algarve busy with French, Spanish, Belgians, Germans, Dutch, many who have not flown but driven to the Algarve. Driven through areas of higher infection from their home countries with rising infection levels.The summer season has only a few weeks to run so it does not make sense to change government policy. Particularly as the UK government is now prioritising the mass return to school in early september."

"Why does not the UK government simply close the borders? No one in or out until it is all over. That would put an end to all this speculation about when or if travel to or from other countries might be deemed to be safe.Question - Manchester City are due to be playing in Lisbon this coming Saturday in the resumed Champions League. If they lose and the law still applies, do their entire party enter 14 days quarantine upon return to the UK? What price they have exemption?"
"Sportsman and supporting staff are exempt because they are supposed to live in a "" bubble "" where for a specified period they have no contact with the general population."
Aberdeen FC have 8 players who have tested positive after hitting the pub last week for a post match drowning of sorrows.Not the best start to the season.
#223 - agtreed. That has been the New Zealand approach throughout and it's working well for them.
"A lot of newspapers this morning are suggesting that Portugal will come off the quarantine list, this week."
Those are the same newspapers that have said the same thing at least twice before and got it wrong.It will happen when it happens and not before.The UK government will not want people booking last minute holidays with children when the priority is to get children back to school in early September.

"Hi there, I'm with you on the frustration front but city's players and indeed all prem league including backroom staff are tested 2-3times a week due to the nature of the game. As a city supporter I wish I could go too but I suppose the team are not going out into Lisbon, just straight to the stadium and fly back?"
"Sorry, which city?"
"Choose to believe what you will in the media.Euro News, Spain, moves to close the border with Portugal and France..Oddly enough , if that is true then that would help Portugal s case with UK flights."
