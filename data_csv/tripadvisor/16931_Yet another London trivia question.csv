"What is the oldest man made ""structure"" in London?"
London wall?
Cleopatra's Needle
Perhaps structure is the wrong word. Hint:It was erected in it's current position to celebrate the British victory over Napoleon. (60 some odd years earlier) 
"henneth, you got it before I even gave the hint. Very Good. It is approximately 3500 years old. There are Egytian and Greek artifacts in the British Museum that are older, but they are not ""structures"". "
"Thanks, Nuke. Others exist in Paris and New York."
"Dang it, Henneth!"
"Just this past summer, I visited the oldest known man made structure here in Georgia. It is a rock mound effigy of an eagle that is approx. 120 feet long, 100 feet wingspan, and 10 feet high. You have to climb a tower to actually see it's shape, but it's striking. It's made entirely out of small to medium quartz stones. There was a tribe of Archaic Indians living in the area 5,000 years ago, but it's believed the mound wasn't built until 2,000 years ago. Oh aptly enough, it's called Rock Eagle."
Here's another one in the form of an answer--Jeopardy stlye--rather than a question.Apple fritters flavoured with ale and ginger.Henneth?!
I think it has something to do with Cockney rhyming slang. Hmmmmmm.What is a bitter?
"What is, ""Now, anenome has just made me hungry again and I feel the need for another recipe!"" In the words of Homer Simpson, ""Mmmmmmm....fritters."""
"I can't remember what the site was, but I did find a medieval recipe for ""Dutch Apple Fritters"" that did use ale to make the batter and ginger as a spice."
"anemone ...are you talking about the rail strike....""bitter rail engineer""...if translating to cockney slang ??? "
As Henneth has dissapeared I will make it easier for everyone else.It was someone's favourite pre-lenten dish.Who was that someone?
"I haven't gone yet. I have actually been suspecting it was a favourite dish of someones but, bless my soul, I cannot think who!!"
"??Here's a clue: He had an eye for the ladies, was a book lover and...."
"Well Pepys liked ale flavoured with ginger, but not sure about the apple fritter bit?Gis anuva clue, darlin?; )"
"ooo. FSM, I LOVE the new picture. It's so regal! Not surprising that Henneth had the answer. He seems to know everything. Nuke, where in Georgia is the rock eagle please?"
"Glad you like my new regal self. Can you imagine how restrictive wearing a ruff would be? Some people have said I look a tad pale, but wait until they see me after my tanning sessions! So anenome ~ what's the answer girl????? Who, who, who??????"
"whistlingdixie. Rock Eagle is about 15 miles north of Eatonton, GA on GA 441. (Eatonton is famed as the home of author Joel Chandler Harris who compiled the Uncle Remus tales)"
"Nuke & Dixie ~ maybe we need to have a southeast TALF meet. We could do a Disneyesque type of pub crawl? Then nuke could hand over the notes for his soon to be published book, what do you think?"
P.S. You can check Rock Eagle out at http://www.lostworlds.org/rock_eagle.html
"Sounds good to me, FSM. However, pubs seem to be few and far between around here. It would make for a long crawl.Thanks, nuke. I'll have to let my Atlanta son know about that site/sight."
"FSM~about 25 to 30 years ago I actually did get about 300 pages of a book manuscript to paper. It was about the old VA hospital and the group of close friends that we had back then and our ""coming of age"" during the extraordinary 1960s. (Did I mention that I marched Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral procession in 1968?) I'm sort of a half-a*sed Forrest Gump, having been present just out of dumb luck for some amazing and/or tragic events. The book's working title was ""44"", referring to the enormous 44 we spray painted on the tank of the huge water tower on the hospital grounds. We were fixated with the number 44 back then (and probably still are) for reasons that would take too long into go into. You could see that 44 for a couple of miles down Peachtree Rd.. (On the back side of the water tower, which faced one of the wealthiest and most exclusive golf clubs in Atlanta, we painted a huge ""SUCK A PUTTER"", much to the chagrine of the golf club's members. It may have helped to lead to the demise of the old hospital.) Jimmy Breslin preempted my title when he published "".44"" his book about the Son of Sam. I never finished the book, but I believe it's in my storage space. I don't know if I could pick it up and finish it. I can't really remember what it feels like to be young and idealistic (and heavily drugged) in the days of ""Peace, Love, and Rock n' Roll"". Too much water under the bridge. And while there was a lot of love and rock n' roll during the ensuing years, there wasn't much peace. If I ever do decide to write that book, you will be my ghostwriter. I'd probably better get to it soon, as a suffer from a condition known as SLE which actually comes and goes but which increasingly over the years seems to mess with my memory. Oh well, back to trivia.What is the airspeed of a fully laden swallow?"
Is that an African swallow or a European swallow?
"I,....I don't know! ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh.........""(fading into the distance)"
"35 mphAnd now back to your book ~ excuses, excuses - you have SUCH a book in you, and da*n it man, you need to have it written. You know you remember it all, yes you do, you just have to be reminded of it!!!Let's have a TALF southeast get together and we'll talk. I think I could ghostwrite that book for you! Then we'll go on a London tour - you, your wife, me & Jim, Dix & her husband and M, we could sell milions!!!! You have some amazing stories Nuke, don't let them die. I have a friend who was sort of left in Vietnam... never supposed to get out and he did... never supposed to spill the bean=s on the fact that the government tried to take out his unit and silence him... because they were deep undercover, etc. you know what I mean.. How about that book? Let's plan a TALF southeast meeting? OK???"
"FullSailMom, isn't that the plot of jacob's Ladder?Anyway...just to throw the cat among the pidgeons and to keep the thread travel related, there is a structure that is probably older than Cleo's needle.www.vauxhallsociety.org.uk/VauxhallBr.htmlWell okay, not so much a structure as a collection of stumps, but it was...MADE IN THE UK! : )"
Wow! That oak is pretty tough stuff to have lasted that long. Those are OLD stumps!
Pepys.So technically Trillian got it right.
"Speaking of Pepys, both he and Daniel Defoe wrote at some length about the bubonic plague epidemic in London in 1665. Athough the Great fire of 1666 destroyed many records of London's some 130 parishes, where do surviving records show to be the largest known ""plague pit"" or mass grave from the 1665 epidemic? "
