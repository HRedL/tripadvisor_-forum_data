"Hi, I know the situation we are all in is very confusing and nothing is 100% sure. I just wanna ask whether you have cancelled your holidays or no. I am wondering how will be tourism this year and how Englishmen perceive travelling this summer. Thanks in advance, would love to hear your thoughts.  Hope you all are healthy and safe"
We’ve essentially given up on our Sept holiday in S/B but haven’t actually cancelled yet. Waiting to see how things pan out over the next month or two. Has the resort opened with a fair few places operating or is it still in semi-lockdown?Jules
Hi sylvia.i have changed my holiday till next year but if by the end of August it is safe to travel I would look to come over for the end of the season .I know Bulgaria is a safer place to be than the UK at the moment so will wait to see what happens
Changed our holiday to next June as we all given up on going away this year .We still in lockdown in England .Keep well and stay safe
I'm coming over for 3 weeks early August but I have my own apartment near New nessebar... I know from friends that everything is opening our end as of next week...
"The death rate in Bulgaria is certainly lower than the UK. I know it's a smaller population but I know where I would feel safer at the moment.Maybe government restictions will eased even more than they already are - who can tell. Certainly not I. From a personal point I can't really see many Brit's travelling on holiday to BG in the coming months. Maybe later in the season but not just yet.Sept can be a good time to visit - however who knows what will happen. I think many a business in Sunny Beach will take a real hit this year. The season is short and would normally be gearing up at this time of year - I hope it goes well for business owners. However what a mess the worlds in - let's hope things improve soon. I'm not holding my breath just yet though.Edited: 10:18 am, May 26, 2020 "
"We had a trip to Cyprus planned for June which is of course not going ahead. We have now changed our August holiday to Sunny Beach to next June. If however we can fly later in the year, I am still trying to decide if I will book another, part of me really wants to have a break, but the other part of me is worrying about the airport and flying situation and if we became sick with COVID19 whilst abroad without insurance. My guess is, that we won't travel until 2021 even though we still won't have insurance but potentially a vaccine with any luck.Edited: 10:31 am, May 26, 2020 "
I'm just wondering if the ethi card will cover till we leave the EU in Dec .always have yearly insurance but as you say covid won't be covered.but life has to start sometime and I think if good checks are in place I would go because personally don't think even by next year there will be a vaccine
"EHIC is supposed to cover till Dec but I’d have concerns about reliance on the public hospitals but presumably they’ll be the ones dealing with Covid. It’s if repatriation is needed due to Covid that’s the potential massive cost.Bulgaria isn’t the issue to me, it’s the transit and airport because social distancing is nigh on impossible on a flight. I couldn’t fancy 3.5 hrs and more wearing a hot, uncomfortable mask! Jules"
We have switched our dates with flights and hotel from 23 rd June to 25 th August . I hopeful the holidays will go ahead!
I have also cancelled my holiday this year to SB not worth the risk delayed to next year.Will also not even entertain a holiday in UK either.Some things are more important than holidays in my opinion and Wife is classed as a frontline worker. She won’t even walk the dog without a face mask no chance getting her on a plane
I know a lot of people won't agree but we decided a few years ago that if we are abroad and anything happens to one of us and the insurance won't pay out we would be cremated were ever we are and ashes brought home then a memorial service at home .my children don't agree but that's what we've decided and the way I'm feeling now I would wear a mask at all times as long as I could live some kind of life instead of just exsisting
I for one will definitely not be visiting Bulgaria this year even if it was given the go ahead. I would normally look to book up for 2021 but some of the prices quoted are a joke and it's cheaper to go to Thailand. After 20 years of visiting Bulgaria it is a possibility that airlines will price it out the market. The cheapness in resort will be wiped out by soaring hotel & Flight prices and places nearer home once again become competitive..
The problem with us from uk is we hav to isolate for 14 days wen we come home from travelling abroad. So I cnt see me going on hols this year. Dnt go til august but cnt take the chance as I am shielded.. stay safe.
I understand your concerns Jules but to be fair if we got covid here we would be stuck alone in hospital with no visitors.i worked for nearly 20 years in jcuh and realised life's a lottery seen too many people die too young.i myself have COPD husband is 67 partially sighted with heart problems so don't know how many holidays we have left so I'm living for today and what will be will be as long as we are not harming anyone else
"Hey Jules, hope you are well? Have sent you a text hun xx"
Thanks for the update on insurance Bridgette .we have a rolling insurance with Barclays bank so that would be brilliant if we are still insured for covid.im like you would never encourage people to do what I'm doing it's everyone's decision to do what's best for them
If the govement do not put to many restrictions on us. U.K. Or Bulgarian. Then we are going on holiday to Bulgaria. In August if that does not happen it will not be under my controle
I have considered flying back to the uk then on to Dublin And back to the uk next day to avoid the new qureentine rules it is very doable If the govement don't close this loop hole
"I was due to travel to Bulgaria in September, and have moved the holiday to September 2021. I must say the Rep at TUI Ireland in Dublin, were very helpful and accommodating with my request.So although September 2021 seems a very long way to go, at least the holiday for next year is already paid for."
Im due to travel early September my first time to sunny beach ive decided to pay the balance of my holiday if i dont get there ill just book it for next year
"I should be in Sunny Beach in 2 weeks time, flights were cancelled. I was just about to book for our second visit at the end of August but Covid broke out. We have 2 weeks in Cyprus booked from 30th July, but that will not be going ahead either. Would I look at going to Bulgaria at the end of August/September if conditions in the UK improve? I would be tempted but up to now cant decide.Speaking to Bulgarian friends who live and have businesses in the resort, they say its very quiet. Only a handful of bars and restaurants open, mostly those that are also open in the Winter. My friend who owns 2 hotels and a restaurant said they have no reservations for this year up to now.I have annual travel insurance through my bank. I have just renewed the policy and I was told they only over for Covid 19 for trips booked before mid March 2020. Anything booked after that date, is not covered."
Hi WLI booked before March 2020 annual insurance up In July . WHen I rang to enquire about renewing I asked if my holiday was covered they said yes as it was booked before March 20 and the insurance policy was just continued. If I did not renew and then took out another policy for next year Covid would not be covered. With them anyway that’s Insure and Go.
"Yes Bridgette, like mine then."
"Jules,the resort looks like it is February. Almost nothing is open, only some supermarkets, a few shops and fast-food restaurants.I do not expect many places to open if the compulsary 14-day quarantine does not fall and the international travel does not start. Our government is encouraging Bulgarians to choose Bulgaria for their holiday, but I dont see many people doing so, and actually there is no chance Sunny beach to get full with only Bulgarians. The loved resort is designed for foreign travellers, not bulgarian ones, and the bigger hotels and places will open when international travel start.However, I see some beach bars planning their Grand openings in some weeks. In addition, the situation with the COVID cases is getting better and better. I examine the info from UK and Bulgaria daily. About BG till now : These days the theaters are going to open, the inside parts of the restaurants are going to be able to work, many kindergardens opened and so on. We are expecting a decision from EU government to remove quarantine. I can say many businesses are restarting their work and little by little life seems to go back to normal.This is the info I can give you at the moment, wish you all the best"
"With regards to insurance, if you have an annual policy that you took about before this crisis reared its ugly ahead, you should be covered for the year, however many/most insurers will exclude any claims that relate to COVID19 or is a consequence of COVID19 when your policy falls due for renewal, we have had an email from our insurers regarding this, so from July our renewal date it is excluded. If you were lucky enough to take your policy out before March this year (not sure of exact date) you should be covered for your holiday this year, depending when you travel. I would recommend as and when your policy falls fue for renewal to read the small print carefully although your insurers should point out that it will be excluded as any significant changes that an insurer makes to a policy should be clearly pointed out to the policyholder.Edited: 4:04 am, May 27, 2020 "
Hi mandmit according to Barclays insurance which I do not have to renew it just carrys on till I cancel my travel plus account. as long as the FCO say it's save to travel I will be covered for covid but will wait and see. but a friend read through the terms on the website and that's what it seems to be implying be great if it's true
I'm so glad I didn't cancel it when it went up to £18 a month but with us both having health issues I knew it was a good insurance so decide to stick with it saying that it does include car breakdown and 6 free visits to the VIP lounges.ive done something right for a change
"I contacted my travel insurers Insure and Go for clarification of cover if I renew my policy, this was their response. Hi there If your policy is renew and provides continuous cover for you (meaning there is no break in cover), any trip booked before the 13th March 2020 would be offered cover in relation to Covid-19, SARS-COV-2, or any mutation of these. If there is a break in cover, cover would not be offered for the above.Any trip booked on or after the 13th March 2020 will not be covered in relation to the above, even in the policy is renewed."
That's what I thought we always use them all and when we go over the 6 they charge us £15 each from our credit card.mandmit so you would be covered if it was safe to go this year is that right as long as your already booked
"Pauline, yes that's correct providing the holidays were booked prior to 13th March, they will cover, any holidays booked after this date, there's no cover. We would have been covered for our holiday in August as we booked it in January but we have changed the holiday to next June now so we won't be covered."
At least it will be good news for some people who haven't had their holidays cancelled yet and decide to go.we cancelled June flights till next year as knew there would be no way it would happen.i think it's wishful thinking on my part that we will get to sunny beach this year but I'm ever the optimist lol
"Yes that's right Pauline, so good news for many I should imagine. Anyone that booked a trip prior to 13th March and had a travel policy in force, they would be covered. Obviously this stance is from 1 insurer (Insure and Go) so I would recommend everyone check with their own insurers, although I can't see how insurers could not cover it if the holiday was booked prior to this date although I think this cut off date may vary from insurer to insurer by a day or 2."
"Sorry, me again! Just un update on my Insure and Go policy. I have now received confirmation that I will be covered for COVID19 for my trip in June 2021 because I originally booked to travel in August prior to 13th March and as I have amended the dates (not a new booking) they will provide cover for COVID 19, see response below from them after I asked the question:- As long as this is amendments to the trip originally booked in January 2020, and not a new trip, cover would be offered in relation to Covid-19.So I am very pleased and surprised with this response and gives me peace of mind for June next year, although I will be contacting them again nearer the time to double check.I would recommend anyone that has changed their holidays (booked prior to 13th March 2020) from this year to next to ask their insurers for clarification. Peace of mind makes all the difference."
Great news for you will take a lot of people's minds
"Hi Bridgette, yes it's good news but definitely check with your own insurers. Yes we had to pay a £40 pp admin fee because it was us that wanted to change the dates and not Jet2 and the holiday itself was £160 per person more, so £200 more pp. I was disappointed with this especially when I was reading that Balkans were allowing customers to change their holidays without any admin fee and in a lot of cases the cost of their holidays were actually less and were given a refund. But the way I looked at it, was we could have just cancelled but we wouldn't have necessarily got the dates we want for next year and potentially the prices may increase even more next year.Edited: 1:13 pm, May 27, 2020 "
"Thats great, re travel insurance Mandy. Mine is the same."
"All well Jules. Jet2 refunded our money within days as we needed to wait for next year's school dates. Just did the odd search for late Aug/early September and was shocked at prices from Birmingham ( we live very close to the airport) Will wait until January before looking again. I see a problem in the number of people moving their dates this reducing flight only places next year and we now have Thomas Cook gone.Fingers crossed for 2021. Hoping Alan,Luke and yourself are well."
"We are supposed to be in SB since yesterday. I will definitely travel abroad this year but not to Bulgaria. Travel insurance won’t cover anything Covid related and you do not want to be reliant on Bulgarian public hospitals, I have experience of them and can best be described as something out of a horror film. I would not risk any of my family ending up there. Will likely look to go to Spain where public hospitals will be of an equivalent standard to Ireland"
If you have booked your holiday before March and have insurance it is covered for covid. Thankfully have never been in hospital abroad except for Paris which was a nightmare!! Wherever you go is a risk for hospitals but if I’m allowed to go I will go. I do luckily have insurance so god forbid I got it would be covered but as others have said it is a personal choice. Stay safe all.
"Bridgette,Just two points to note in the travel insurance. Even if you are allowed to travel but there is a travel advisory again unnecessary travel your insurance won’t cover you and a lot of travel insurance companies trying to get out of paying for anything Covid related saying it’s an exceptional event so double check with them before you go that they will actually stand behind the policy. I love sunny beach but not a place I would want to get sick in"
"Jdublin is absolutely correct, your insurance won't cover you if FCO have advised against non essential travel. However, if and when restrictions are lifted and we are able to travel whether that will be this year or next, you should be covered for COVID19 if your trip was booked prior to 13th March 2020 as I said in my previous posts (double check with your own insurers though peeps). As it stands at the moment no cover at all as we have all been advised against non essential travel.Edited: 7:04 am, May 28, 2020 "
Don’t blame you Bridgette. If it was just myself and my wife I’d go but we have two young kids so will wait until next year for SB. Have a trip planned for Spain for end of August so hopefully of getting there
