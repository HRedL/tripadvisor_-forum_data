"This is the BVI reaction - awaiting the Premier to speak this morning.""A curfew went into effect last night. You cannot leave your house from 8pm until 6am. Starting this Friday at 8pm, it is a 24-hour curfew for 6 days. Meaning, no one can leave their homes at all for the next 6 days. And that will probably be more. I think this even means going grocery shopping, but I'm not sure. We are waiting for the Premier to speak today.Previously, there was already a travel ban in place. And that obviously remains. No one was allowed in by air or sea regardless of if you are a belonger, resident or tourist."
