HelloI am wondering for those who have traveled to Playa del Carmen area if anyone contracted the virus when traveling ? Did you end up getting the virus once coming home ?
"If you are worried about travelling during this time, I would start planning a trip at least a year or two from now. You can always go to your preferred airline, resort and both governments website to look at the new safety protocols in place. By waiting to travel it gives you more time to save up money for an even better vacation."
it's an interesting question.
"If anyone gets Covid-19, I have a feeling the tripadvisor Playa del Carmen forum will be the last place they think of to post for contact tracing purposes. LOL."

I just returned from PDC last week and both my boyfriend and I tested negative.
ou come while at the beach and indoors.There are not a lot of cases of covid in the Playa area. It has 907 cases in total of whom 84 have died and 511 have recovered leaving only 312 active cases.
I got back from PDC 3 weeks ago - no Covid and it was confirmed with a negative test upon my return.Going back to Casitas August 20th and Secrets the Vine Sept 4th. Felt safer there than back in Ohio
Personally I think the thing to do to keep yourself safe is stay away from your fellow tourist. I just watched a video of a resort I’m considering. The staff was perfect. Mask hand sanitizer etc. The other tourists apparently think when they got to the resort fantasyland took over and they don’t have to do anything. So my solution is just going to be to stay far away from the people who apparently think when they got off a plane they suddenly became safe and want to infect me with whatever they have
"That concerns me, too. Carol."

Getting sick from COVID-19 in Mexico – The Mexican nightmare.https:/…
Greg’s Post points out why you need travel insurance. It’s not going to be cheap. I have to be honest this doesn’t really concern me. As we will self quarantine for two weeks before we go on vacation and we’re only going be there about four days so even if we get exposed to it on day one we will probably back in the United States before we discover that unfortunately.And yes we will quarantine when we get home too.
"Carol's post demonstrates why we are all still in this mess. You pick it up unawares while travelling, and don't know until you are home. Thanks for bringing it back and exposing who know how many people on the way. It's nice that you can be so unconcerned."
Welcome to a TRAVEL forum YURz.
"Carol A, You can quarantine when you get home but if you have the virus, what about all the people on the plane with you?"
"Vacationers need to wear masks indoors at resorts unless they're eating or drinking, and practice social distancing. I'm much more afraid of my fellow vacationers than hotel staff."
"There is so much blame to go around for why our world is in a pandemic....blaming Carol or anyone else for wanting to travel (safely) is probably the least egregious cause! Totally projecting your anger at the wrong people. Let's start with poorly regulated wild animal food markets....lax public health standards and spending in many countries, including the USA....a disregard for common sense mask use, interior building social distancing and hand washing hygiene...zero investment in proactive vaccine development for emerging viruses...the list goes on."
"Exactly why everyone should be required to quarantine two weeks before, Covid test results from a test center, & if clear a ok to go. Then masks/shields while in any enclosed area of (insert foreign country here). As much I want to travel, the guidelines need to be more strict."
"I purchased Seven Corners Liaison Travel Plus, which includes Covid-19 coverage for our family of 4 during our 10 day trip. The price seemed reasonable. https:/…liaison-travel-plus.pdf"
"My post was completely TRAVEL related. I am not blaming anyone for anything. But people who travel, although they claim to be unconcerned for themselves, must be aware of all the many contact points between home and their destination and back. It's not enough to say, ""Oh, I got it. How unfortunate."" By the time you do realize it, you may have caused infections in several other people. This is why we have not contained it. I have cancelled several vacations for this reason and am extremely disappointed. I really would like to travel again soon., but don''t think it's wise until things are more under control. I am not judging anyone for travelling. But if you are travelling, you need to be concerned and aware. Not just for yourself, but for everyone you may come in contact with."
"But with so many asymptomatic cases and no way to universally test everyone, including the healthy, every 5 days, there will continue to be community spread until a vaccine arrives and we achieve worldwide herd immunity. Until then, weigh your individual risk/reward, practice good public health like wearing a mask, keeping your distance from others and washing your hands religiously."
"I strongly believe Carol A is the Travel Industry agent, in all posts ZERO compassion about spreading virus to locals, all she cares of is ppl getting insurance how does this will help locals?? Who will help them to handle consensuses of exposure? How an fortunate to them, but Carol would not mention them in any postsCarol posted: ""we’re only going be there about four days so even if we get exposed to it on day one we will probably back in the United States before we discover that unfortunately."""
"I have been paid the ultimate compliment....If you don't like the facts someone posts accuse them of being a shill.... Especially when you are accused by someone using a business account to post! LOL!I have VERY bad news for DreamDays. Unlike you I have NEVER worked in the tourist industry. I also wish that you would quit sending me personal messages trying to defend yourself and quit posting personal information about your friends unless you can assure us you have their permission to spill their personal data all over the internet! (Personally I would not be happy to discover you had done this as your ""discouragement method"" :You could have considered just posting ""A friend has covid"" but instead you decided to give us all his details :( ) I have posted about insurance to counteract the ""fake news"" that some people want to use to discourage travelers. I believe people should make INFORMED decisions not ""tripadvisor fear mongered"" decisions. Sorry that offends you. But I am probably not even going. My post was theoretical. However, it was made to raise a point and apparently the point is ""attack people who post things we don't like"" Sorry but the facts are that you are letting tourist in opens you up to exactly what I posted. They won't know they have it in MexicoI am not really worried about being attacked. I will make a decision based on what I feel is right in a few months. It's too early to make that decision now. But if I do come I will exercise a lot of precautions to avoid both getting and giving anything away. I will wear a mask unless I am laying on a beach, eating or drinking. I will NOT be going to crowded places or hanging out at bars, crowded hot tubs etc. I will have quarantined for 2 weeks prior to arrival and wear an N95 mask on the plane. If you get within 6' of me without a mask I will ask you politely (the first time) to move away. (The second time may get really rude ask the jerk at my local grocery store :) ) Of course this is pretty much what I do at home. When I am at the grocery or the MD's office (today's big outing) I wear a mask. I don't get near people and am a liberal user of hand sanitizer and hand washing. I'm not your high risk tourist. That's the jerks who think that mask wearing is only for the staff I do feel for the people of Mexico. I am incredibly lucky that I can work from home and my income is not affected. I wonder where some of your compassion is for people that are having to make hard decisions between putting food on the table or being exposed to the rude tourist that can't be bothered to wear a mask because ""it's my right to infect others"". Because of the carelessness of my fellow tourists I admit that I am likely to cancel. And sadly that impacts the ability of people to feed their family. I do feel sorry for those that depend on tourists to make a living. Because so many tourists seem to be irresponsible on vacation it's going to affect their physical health and possibly their financial heath as those of us who were going to try a responsible way to do this are saying ""yeah the resort is doing a great job but since I have to hang out with tourists who are clueless I will stay home"". I do believe there's a way to travel responsibly now. And I originally thought the resorts were following that but, honestly unless the resorts get a backbone and start saying ""mandatory mask wearing"" I don't think it's  But go ahead and attack me, I am sitting in Atlanta not affecting anyone LOL! Your problem is there now!Edited: 3:34 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"""Carol's post demonstrates why we are all still in this mess. You pick it up unawares while travelling, and don't know until you are home. Thanks for bringing it back and exposing who know how many people on the way. It's nice that you can be so unconcerned.""I agree. And that statement was unfortunate. I am ""unconcerned"" because honestly I am not making a decision now on going or not so it's all ""theoretical"" Once it gets closer then I will probably get concerned."
"If someone picks up the virus in their travels and then exposes others at the resort, airport, or on the plane -- isn't that what everyone there kind of signed up for? If you are taking a risk to travel - you are taking the risk that you or others you come into contact with, have the virus. It isn't more someone's fault for getting it and possibly spreading it to other travelers, when it could be the other way around --- or, who knows - maybe both already had it. The point is - if you go on vacation and you get it - it is nobody else's fault except your own. Who I feel sorry for are the workers in all stages of travel - cab driver, airport people, flight attendants, resort staff. Obviously that doesn't mean they want you to stay home -- if everyone stays home, they won't have a job! So it boils down to everyone doing what they feel comfortable with. As long as, once you get home, you stay home and don't go spreading it around your community, to people who are just doing their banking or getting their groceries. Quarentine until you know. OH, it's not worth it to stay home for two weeks and away from fellow shoppers and co-workers? Then don't go, because bringing it home and going out into the community is selfish and wrong - until you absolutely know you didn't get it in your travels. As for me and my family - we're waiting. I'm not saying everyone should wait, it's all a matter of how much risk you are willing to take, and for what. I feel like I'm already taking risks by getting take out food and going grocery shopping, but to me - that doesn't sound quite as stupid as ending up in the hospital because you couldn't skip a year of vacation. Especially ending up in a Mexican hospital - yikes. The thing that isn't fair - and who said life was fair -- the odds of me getting it are probably not that much less than someone going on vacation getting it."
"""...the odds of me getting it are probably not that much less than someone going on vacation getting it.""These have been exactly my thoughts as I've read the comments on this thread. Our family went to Playacar recently. We were required to wear masks most of the time - in the airports on both ends, whenever we got within a few feet of another person, in our transport to/from the resort, and in the public spaces of the resort - and we and most everyone else we saw complied. When in the outdoor spaces, we didn't wear our masks, and we distanced ourselves from others who were not wearing them. The staff at our resort were very diligent about checking our temperature and asking us to apply sanitizer any time we entered the main building or the restaurants. They also asked people to put a mask on if they showed up at a restaurant without it. Staff wore masks the entire time and sanitized often.While is was nice to have such low attendance at the resort, I found myself wondering how many people were not working because there was no work available for them. One of the servers I talked to has 4 children at home, and was working her tail off. Another rides the bus for 45 minutes for his morning shift, rides the bus home for 2 hours, then rides the bus back for an evening shift. When we shopped the vendors near our hotel, I asked a few of them how things were going and they are struggling because the area is normally packed at this time of year. If you go, please safely visit the vendors, and tip the staff/drivers as well as you can, because I'm sure there are struggles we can't see.As for our return, we have been home for 2 weeks now and all of us are healthy. We had zero contact with people the first week, and minimal contact the last few days. I am happy to answer sincere questions, but will not engage in debate or hate."
"""....So it boils down to everyone doing what they feel comfortable with. As long as, once you get home, you stay home and don't go spreading it around your community,...""you have the luxury to stay home, but local workers do not, they still have to come to work, and if they got the virus it will not be known immediately, is the while virus spreads.Travel can be continued only when instant testing is available. till then people can survive on basic food, not luxury items for a change. But many lives going to be saved. Now is not right time for travel."
Everybody doing what they feel comfortable with is exactly why we are still dealing with this virus. I am not at all worried about getting sick. I do take all the precautions though because I AM concerned about the continual spread.
"I understand that local workers don't have the luxury of staying home. But if nobody goes, they'll end up staying home anyway, because they won't have a job. So you tell me - what is the best way of handling this? I'm not saying I'm going to go -- I'm not. It's not worth the risk to me. But if others want to take the risk, apparently the locals are fine with that, because if they weren't, they'd quit their jobs and stay home. Oh they can't? See - that's where the problem is. They can't quit - they need the money. So again - you tell me what th answer is. I am taking it that the locals are happy that some tourists are willing to take the risk - and of course they have to take the risk. If I had it my way - travel would be shut down, and all the workers in Mexico would get unemployment -- but you know that isn't going to happen."
"I do think this is a very sad situation. If you’re working in the tourism industry in Mexico you have a couple of choices one go to work and possibly get Covid or two don’t go to work and your family goes hungryIf the tourist don’t come then they get option two. And some of them probably think that’s the worst option. I don’t know what I would decide in that situation and luckily I hope I never have to be in that kind of situation. But I understand why some people who work in the industry in Mexico want us to come. They need a job. It’s that simple. That’s not an easy decision, I think that the tourists thar to do go can make it better by being respectful and wearing a mask and practicing social distancing just like they would do it if they were going to Disney in Orlando. (Where by the way they do make you wear a mask and try to do social distancing) No matter what the resort tells you or you want to believe, just because you’re in Mexico at an all inclusive resort it’s not safe. And you may not be safe. So do the right thing and be an adult. It’s never killed anyone to wear the mask. I don’t know of any confirmed deaths for mask wearing but there a lot of confirmed deaths from CovidEdited: 8:04 pm, July 31, 2020 "
I would plan the trip later on if you are worried about getting the virus.
"Again you Carol? Motivating people .. for what? No, you are mistaken people are not dying in Mexico from hungriness, Mexico Gov did distribute free food when it was lockdown, And ... today Mexico beat all its records, ""México informa de 8 mil 458 casos de Covid-19 en 24 horas y marca récord de contagios"" Google Translate: Mexico reports 8,458 cases of Covid-19 in 24 hours and record mark of infectionsIs not right time for traveling, even if you but insurance which Carol soo much wants to sell youEdited: 12:32 am, August 01, 2020 "
I am thinking of going to Playa the first 2 weeks in December. Im glad to see you just came back safe. Would you advise goingThank you for any information
"So much rhetoric here and elsewhere from the same player...For folks considering travel ANYWHERE, getting a test just before you leave will at least show you are not an asymptomatic carrier. You can get an effective lab test result within a few days if you pay for it. Then if you do not test positive, just be considerate of others around you at your destination. Obviously now is not the time to be traveling, but there are no restrictions. And we can see that many Americans (and others) care little about spreading the virus in their own communities, so how will they behave in a foreign country?"
Cancun Days if you are so concerned over this direct your energy to your government to shut down international flights. Mexico depends on tourism and citizens need jobs so you can't have it both ways.
"I was in PDC and PM 7/7 this year and am booked again 9/14. I am comfortable going back. I think the people in the area were great and taking appropriate precautions. More that at home. You,as a traveler, are responsible to take these same precautions. Use your senses, wear mask, was hands, and distance from others. Simple. I am also a nurse so I know the seriousness of it and am not just downplaying."
"Mexico is in the top 6 counties in the world with cases and deaths from C19 what are your chances? f stressed about it dont travel.Edited: 12:15 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Well since a lot of the people on here are from the United States, i would assume that Mexico doesn’t actually look that bad.We are well ahead of Mexico."
"Mexico does very few tests, almost only when someone already hospitalized, and does not count dead who died at home, number is much higher than published. Mexican people are most obese in the world according to statistics, too many with diabetes (thanks to soo much popular soft drinks) it will end up worse than US. And travelers just fueling it"
"To clarify, if you account for positive cases per population (which is the only true way to count it) mexico is #60 in the world. not top 6."
Never backs get in your way. After all the only fact that you think matters is that you have one friend that died Kobe. You know no one else in Mexico is ever gone hungry. Really?https:/…https:/…https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2…I know you’re going to attack me because after all if you can convince me to tell people that you are the only person who is right on here no one will ever come to Mexico again. But what you just told us is that you apparently are in a good financial situation so you don’t care if anybody else id hungry because you have food so you’re happy. First you spread your late friends personal information all over this forum without his permission or his family’s permission and now you’re a social economic expert too. Unbelievable
"fact is that 55 000 Mexicans died from covid, many died home no one ever counted them, spread continues many more to die.How many total died from hungriness? please arox number ... to compareAnd I'll repeat. Mexico gov did help people with free food distribution:See: https:/…apoyo-alimentario-covid19If you have urge to help locals, then simply donate, but ... how many did or will?Edited: 10:04 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"My 2 teens, my wife, and I visited Cancun in early July. We stayed at the Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach. The hotel employees do a great job at protecting themselves and the guests . The majority of guests followed the rules of wearing masks inside the hotel (there were a few nuts that did not and were reminded by the hotel staff). Anyway, we had a great time .We stayed in Cancun for 11 days, came back happy, tested for COVID on return with negative results.Safe travels!"
"""positive cases per population"" stats mean nothing to the person that died or the family dealing with the grief. But never fear, the numbers were updated this morning and Mexico is not #6 anymore. They are now #3.""The U.S. has the highest number of COVID-19 cases (5,141,208) and deaths (164,537), followed by Brazil (101,752), Mexico (53,929) and the U.K. (46,611). As of Wednesday, there have been 20,295,343 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide and 741,423 deaths."" https:/…"
Did you feel ill? just wondering why you got tested
"Looking at the numbers in US only: first they told 60 000 expected to die from covid, then told 120k, now they tell 300k by December, today number is 167k, I wonder about those 133k they project to die by Dec, is any chance to save their life? Then how? What must gov do to save lives? My humble opinion is to lock border immediately to stop the spread , Those 133k still walking between us, they unaware that they ... going to be gone by Dec?Edited: 9:08 am, August 14, 2020 "
TripAdvisor is reaching critical mass. That sweet spot where every post is nothing but politics and opinion and zero posts about actual travel. We did it guys.
Dreamdays have gone total Psycho. Im going to cancun next week I will write a full review here which I'm sure Joan and dreamdays will love
">> ""That sweet spot where every post is nothing but politics and opinion and zero posts about actual travel""I don't even bother reading those posts, so it's still all travel for me."
"Hey MisterB nice to hear from you. How's 'la nueva normalidad' in the Caribbean?I bought a ticket for Costa Rica, Avianca cancelled."
"Until today I do not understand why covid considered ""political"" , something in the news that I am missing? Curious why any my post mentioned covid classified a ""psycho or political"" People don't trust data posted that is 168k dead and 300k projected by the December? Covid is 100% travel related as it travels using people."
">> ""How's 'la nueva normalidad' in the Caribbean?""Life is OK here.The main things we have to get used to is closed beaches and wearing facemasks.Hotels, restaurants and supermarkets are open but operating at lower maximum capacities (no big deal).Some tourist activities are open: cenotes, theme parks, diving, snorkelling.Still closed: beaches, archaeological sites, bars, nightclubs, gyms (no big deal for me). Guests staying at some beachside hotels have beach access.Restrictions also vary among the municipalities. In Benito Juarez (Cancun) and Tulum, you can be fined or detained for not wearing a mask. A few people have been arrested, but that was after they were warned and still refused to mask-up -- so really, arrested for being stupid in public.At Playa del Carmen, we have to wear masks upon entering stores, but wearing them on the street is not enforced.While beaches are officially closed, they opened at Playa for a couple of weeks, but restrictions were not followed so the beaches closed again. Beaches will reopen on August 20 for 10 days, and if people follow the restrictions (distancing, no food, etc.), they might stay open.Buses, ferries & transportation are running but at reduced frequency.I'd rather be at Playa than anywhere else in the region. In the state of Yucatan, there's a ""dry"" law in place -- no alcohol sales!Anything specific you want to know?Edited: 11:57 am, August 15, 2020 "
"I have been in Playa for a wk. I have a condo on Calle 38 and had some business here to tend to that required my presence. I was at Zenzi’s at 6 pm last night (10th and the beachfront). Small groups of people together walking on the beach, and in the water. No one was “set up” w chairs on the beach but they were walking, no one stopping them. Since the beaches are reopening this Thursday perhaps police are not enforcing as much, I don’t know as that was the 1st time I’ve been oceanfront.It’s easy to social distance and wear a mask, and stay away from those who are not doing so outside.All restaurants I have been to are enforcing distancing and mask use when up from tables, just like in Northern VA where I live. I did see a place on 5th Ave the other night, Baton Rouge, that had a salsa DJ w dancing outside and there clearly was no social distancing or mask use while up dancing. But you can stay away from those places, just go somewhere else.The town was picking up re the tourist population and pace as it got closer to the weekend. The street demolition on 5th and some side streets down around Calle 8 and below is disruptive but 5th Ave can still be walked, it’s packed dirt. Some of the side streets btwn 10th Ave and 5th Ave are unwalkable, others are ok. The zocalo is walled off w wood fencing.It was a bit depressing early in the wk to see businesses closed that don’t appear to be coming back. Legends Sports Bar in particular for me. They served food so could be open. But sign is down, it’s gone."
"Oh I thought I was posting this on the Playa status update thread. Oh well, take aim and fire at me for being here. I could care less. Being here is no different than being in VA for me. As for getting here, there were 50 people on the SEA flight, I wore mask surgical gloves and face shield, wiped down my tray and covered it, wiped down seat belt connections, covered seat back w a disposable seat cover, and I’m disabled so I boarded 1st and sat on aisle 2 aisle seat w no one else on my row on either side, no one in rows in front or behind me . Didn’t eat or drink or get up during flight.I was scheduled to go home today but when I checked late last night I was assigned boarding group C, so I knew at least 100 people were checked in for the flight. So I cancelled and switched to a flight on Tues."
"DreamDays......if you see americans who refuse to wear a mask ask what their politics are,???,,,then you will understand why unfortunately corvid19 has become ""political"",,,,,,you would think we would all work together to try and prevent the spread of a virus (which we still do not know everything about) and wear a mask to help protect others but it now depends on a persons political beliefs,,,,,,very sad...,,"
