Leaving next week for Paris on Air France-Airline just sent word out that a pilot strike is scheduled for Sept.15-they can't guarantee that my flight won't be cancelled.They will refund or give voucher for another trip.Air France rep. was hopeful that flight will probably go as planned.They will inform us 48 in advanced.Very stressed out-anyone have experience with this or knowledge about these strikes?
Here's a previous about the possible strike: tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k77590…

"No one really knows. Post where you like but you´ll just need to wait and see what happens.Unfortunately, you have not indicated where you live nor from where you are flying. It can make a huge difference. If your flight is transatlantic, it is very unlikely that your flight will be affected in the least. If you are coming from somewhere in Europe, you´ll have a much higher degree of risk that cancellations and disruptions will affect you."
"There was an article in today's Le Parisian about AF flight crews who are now refusing to fly to countries affected by the Ebola epidemic. Nothing new on the ""regular"" strike though, same information that was reported earlier."
"The latest notice from Air France also says you can reschedule to other dates in September without charge.airfrance.fr/FR/en/local/information/news/ne…If you can travel a day earlier, or a few days later, maybe this is an option worth considering."
