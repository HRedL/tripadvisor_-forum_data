"Though I posted this in the CV-19 Info thread, I figured it should be posted separately for the people planning or wondering about May trips.The guv confirmed what we figured--the 14 day quarantine for ALL arrivals to Hawaii is extended through May 31st. The State's lockdown order is as well.He did lighten the restriction against walking or running in beaches. Good move....that was stupid.So, remember: if you choose to visit now, you will be in mandatory quarantine for 2 weeks or the length of your stay--whichever is shorter. You are NOT allowed to go shopping, pick up food, drive around, go to a beach or park, hike, etc. You must have all food delivered. You are allowed to leave only to go to the airport or a medical appointment/emergency.Because Quarantourists have been ignoring the rules, new policies are also in place. They are more strict and enforcement *will* be stronger. Guarans locals will call the cops and report people even more, too.Violating the quarantine or any of the other Emergency Orders (State or County) are misdemeanors. The penalty includes fines up to $5,000 and jail up to a year.....and yes--you can be charged with multiple counts.Edited: 10:03 pm, April 25, 2020 "
Interesting additional order........Ige is now demanding the neighbor island mayors run everything to do with CV-19 and emergency orders/proclamations by him. He has just yanked much of their power.This may not go over well.
Ige was later seen choosing his Fall clothes from a catalog.http://www.od43.com/Organisationsbuch_10.jpg
How would Ige like it if the president did the same to him?Probably doesn't like the praise Kawakami is getting(Deserved or not)
"Apparently pointing out that HI is turning into a fascist state is too much for some people.Does Hawaii not have an ACLU chapter or any civil liberties attorneys?Quarantine is defined as ""that which separates and restricts the movement of people who are exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.""As far as I know, the state is not presenting any evidence that the individual people being quarantined HAVE been exposed to a contagious disease. And by evidence, I mean that which will stand up in court, such as test results. A blanket quarantine is very clearly unconstitutional.When people are detained or their liberty restricted, they are entitled to judicial review, which normally would be a writ of habeas corpus. I have not seen any such requests made of HI's government. Has HI's governor suspended the writ of habeas corpus?The ACLU was very concerned with unconstitutional quarantines in 2015.https:/…aclu-ebolareport.pdfWhat are they doing now? Suing states and cities to release convicted criminals.As to the travel aspects of this, HI is going to kill its revenue voluntarily and then appeal to the federal government for bailout money. Without the money that tourism generates the state will have to make hard choices. It isn't just the direct revenue, like the $2 billion in GET, but the indirect revenue too like the income tax revenue from businesses and residents who work in the hospitality trade.If other tourist locations reopen and HI doesn't, there will be an increment of travel business that doesn't return to HI. Will that be 5%? 10%? No one can predict, but Hawaii's self immolation will be painful."
"I didn't click on your post, Scott.As for evidence, how about the guy from WA. via Vail who brought it here with him--and died? Is that enough ""proof"" or ""evidence"" for you? How about the fact that most cases are travel related--and that the quarantine includes ALL arrivals to Hawaii? There's no discrimination against a class or set.The ACLU could scream all they want......but the stats DO support a blanket quarantine-which is why they have been quiet about it here. Emergency orders aren't subject to the same prohibitions as orders issued in the normal course of business. That's why they are ""emergency"" orders. Otherwise, governments couldn't close airports when a hurricane or blizzard makes operation dangerous (for example). Or close roads when lava is flowing over them, close rivers when they are above flood stage, evacuate people from near dams or levees, etc.People who claim things are unconstitutional rarely realize how many things are *not* unconstitutional....like being arrested for yelling ""fire"" in a theater (one of the oldest examples of suspension of free speech).Yes, the economic impact will be huge and long term....like the whole country and most of the world will also see."
Scott is spot on. They will beg feds to bail them out and use this to try to get them out of previous deficits. If you travel with an infected person you should be quarantined. They have not demonstrated any of this. As tragic as this is the terminal rate and symptoms do not warrant this type of emergency. Laws without legislation are not legal. 603 cases in Hawaii in 4+ months.
"The role of “hidden zombies” - asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic - is only now being recognized as important silent spreaders. With the islands having limited medical capacity, prudence is wise.We don’t want the economy to recover via a boost in coffin sales. Less dramatic though, is also the fact that those infected, but do not die, can end up with a much longer recovery process than first thought. And the long-term consequences have not manifested yet.I’m in week 3, going into week 4, and I still have residual effects from a “mild” infection. I was lucky, this time. And now, there’s some evidence from Italy and China that infected people, like me, can continue to be infectious way longer than the guidelines currently allow for.The only safe course of action right now is to: a) assume that you are infectious, and do everything in your power to not infect others, AND b) assume everyone else is infectious, and do everything in your power to not become infected.Seriously, Ige has it right: let’s keep our people alive and well first. Then worry about the economy (and vacations) later. -> -> Priorities."
"""If you travel with an infected person you should be quarantined. ""So...............the multi million dollar question: How do you know who is or isn't infected? Who is just incubating and asymptomatic when flying in--but in the hospital days later, and dead a few weeks later (see my post above)? Do you quarantine everyone who came into contact with that person? Or just his/her family or companions? The worst cluster on Maui started at the hospital......from one person, it has so far been documented to have infected 37 staff and at least 20 patients. Many of those people had no symptoms for over a week, thereby spreading it MORE. But they didn't even know they were sick.One study about Patient Zero in the Seattle outbreak traced him contacting 65 people the day he landed at SEA. Would you quarantine all of them? Oh, wait--he didn't know he was sick, either.If you haven't grasped the idea.....TESTING is what the world needs for this. Reliable, accurate tests that can both determine it ""live"", and also more research to determine whether people are immune after having it and getting antibodies. Obviously, vaccines would be lovely as well."
">>>That's why they are ""emergency"" orders.<<<Emergencies last a week, ten days, not ten weeks, especially since covid 19 has already peaked in Hawaii.https:/…hawaiiWhat would be reasonable would be for the state to mandate face coverings for everyone and be sure they have the resources to provide them.While not every measure South Korea took would work in the U.S. overall, many might translate well to Hawaii. There never was a general lockdown in South Korea, nor a shuttering of businesses. Yes South Korea is much smaller, smaller than Southern California, more homogeneous and much more authoritarian, but again, they did not go to the draconian lengths that HI has gone to."
"Well, we aren't China, S. Korea, Iran, Germany, Italy, the UK, Spain,or anywhere else......we're Hawaii :-).Had the Muppet been more forceful and less of a blithering idiot for the first month of this, we would be in a different place. But he wasn't, and we aren't. The mayors' efforts to contain and prevent spread sure weren't helped by him.PS--Their numbers are off. We have had 14 deaths and more cases than they show, as well.Edited: 4:35 pm, April 26, 2020 "
">>>Seriously, Ige has it right: let’s keep our people alive and well first. Then worry about the economy later<<<That is a false dichotomy. South Korea controlled the spread of Covid 19 without shutting down the economy.It is also false to present ""the economy"" as some huge nameless, faceless entity that isn't important.""The economy"" is the sum total of individuals working and earning money with which they clothe, feed, shelter and buy health insurance for their families and all the ancillary things that go with it those. If there is not an economy people will die of other causes."

What if you open the store and not that many high spending tourists come?
"there is no cure now. When will it be somewhat OK? When 7 billion people are vaccinated?Good luck with that. Although I would agree to a mandatory shot if available similar to what they do with countries with Malaria, or in the past smallpox.It will be wild in the streets if you think this can go on for 12 - 18 months.Working isn't to just buy new shoes. it's for everything. That's why they call it livelihood."
"Honu has a good point. Honu -- hope you do not mind. I am copying part of your post from Fireball's closed thread as it has more detail.""So I don't care who opens up what, not thinking of it as a fun trip in mask and gloves and worry. Want vaccine. Will spend my money on other things like the three oil paintings I just got from Australia and Berlin. Highest spenders may be fussier, anyway I am. Common sense.""I agree with this. Although I want to come back to Hawaii, a vacation of masks and gloves and constantly looking over my shoulder is not that appealing to me. I'll probably still come to Hawaii, but my vacations may look different. I'll be more likely to stay at Villa with a pool on the ocean, rather than at the condo and resort complexes I have. 95% of my dinners will probably be at the villa. The ridiculously pricey jewelry and mementos I buy for myself and my family every trip at galleries and shops - probably not anymore. Because it's just no fun even being out dealing with the masks and gloves going shop to shop. If a pool is even open, possibly wearing a mask while laying out? No thanks. If that is the new normal, DIY trips at villas will probably become the new normal for me.It's sad, because it'll definitely be a different amount of money my trips interject to servers and bartenders and shop owners. But I won't want to deal with the kind of trip Honu speaks of, and my guess is a lot of people who are higher spenders will feel the same way."
Why would anyone go to Hawaii for a vacation if they had to quarantine 14 days.
"If they had a month or more maybe but the real thing is, if conditions are such that I have to be quarantined because I may have picked up COVID19 along my journey (unlikely to get it in my house or solitary walks, disinfect my deliveries) I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY. I don't care if it is Hawaii or New Zealand, I AM NOT FLYING."
It would be a good idea to read what the gov actually said. Couching it in certain ways gives it meaning that could be skewed. Then read Kauai’s mayor’s reaction to it before any judgements are made.
"Being on the Maui forum, perhaps reading the Maui Mayor's response(s) would be more logical, LOL. But like I said......the guv says they have to submit new orders or extensions through him from now on. And like I said, that may not go over well.There's already an atty on Maui who says Ige has overreached, too......with an interesting legal argument presented."
Here's an update from the Mayor's morning radio talk:https:/…It will be nice if the guv approves of opening parks for us......even if it's only some and for limited hours (like Oahu has done).
"An example of how the Muppet's declaration is already causing new woe:https:/…Here on Maui, florists were allowed to operate on a limited basis. The order allowing that will expire on May 4th, so our mayor had to ask Ige for permission for Mother's Day here on Maui:https:/…"
"Yep, someone gave the go ahead for flower delivery on Oahu that wasn’t authorized to do so. I believe the islands need to do some things on their own but the state needs to be involved also. Working together isn’t a bad thing. The left hand needs to know what the right hand is doing. Otherwise chaos ensues."
"I see no reason the florists should not be able to deliver flowers.... they are Non-essential here too.......... but they could just leave the flowers on the porch etc... and call or text when they are delivered. I hope our Gov lifts the orders for them! Mothers Day needs to happen!--LoriEdited: 9:48 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"Lori, I agree......and that was why it had been allowed here on Maui all along. I can't see why it can't be allowed here and on Oahu. If Ige's people can't agree and get their stories straight, the businesses shouldn't be paying the price.The only chaos has been caused by Ige."
The problem isn't only in Hawaii it's an issue through out the country. Narcissist Governors are acting like dictators drunk with power. They're all playing one-upsmanship with their droning hour long press conferences that no ones watching.That's why you have to push back people who work for government don't believe that they work for the people they believe that you should serve them.It's time for civil disobedience.
"Well, the flower deliveries are ON! The Muppet gave in."
I'm just grateful that See's Candy is considered essential in CA.
"It shouldn’t go over well. These power hungry Governors like my awful one in CA, Gavin Newsom, have been overreaching. We have done what he asked and been sheltering in place since the middle of March. The onslaught of Covid patients has not happened. I know of 3 hospitals in my county alone that are furloughing medical staff. Why does Ige or Newsom need to use 30 day windows. They should should work in 14 day time periods. Open up slowly but consistently with safety precautions and personal responsibility in place. If you are sick, elderly, or immune deficient then you shelter in place longer and use delivery services for food and supplies."
"Yeah and then by going out more young runners athletes and people in fine shape get it, get blood clots or strokes, have impaired health and earning power for 20 30 40 years. Sounds like a good plan. That will get a great economy down the pike. Wash your hands!"
"How accurate are those numbers? When you see the directions from the CDC telling drs doing death certificates to put Covid-19 as THE cause when in fact all patients who died were not tested for Covid. Drs can write Covid if they suspect Covid. Well Covid looks very much like the flu or even bronchitis. If a person has a TBI from an accident but they had a cough before they died the cause of death should be accident not Covid. Hospitals get $30000 for Covid patients which was implemented so that people wouldn’t be afraid to go to the hospital because they couldn’t pay for it. If public policy and shutting down our economy is based on the numbers then they damn well better be extremely accurate. People’s lives depend on accuracy. Drs are reporting how people are not going to the doctor and hospitals because they are afraid of Covid but they are getting sicker. We are missing cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diagnoses. We need honest reporting by drs"
"What about how Sweden handled it? They only had the compromised the old and sick. They didn’t close down school. They practiced social distancing but businesses stayed open. Statistically they didn’t have more people die then their next door neighbor , Norway. We can do this smartly. People have personal responsibility. This is the only epidemic where healthy people have been quarantined"
"Sweden has 22 deaths per 100k people vs 4 per 100k for Norway. That's 220 per million which would make it the 9th worst in the US. In contrast, California is 48 deaths per million - maybe we're doing something right, albeit at a high cost. We can debate whether it's all worth it, but the outcomes of Sweden and Norway are not the same."
Come to Kauai and see how much home delivery is available. I really don’t care what Cali is doing. My concern lies right here on Kauai and Hawaii. We’ll take care of ourselves.
"Honu since you mentioned the young adults.. The share of deaths among people under 45 with no underlying conditions is only about 1%. I happen to fall under this category and to me it's ridiculous they decided to go full on Wuhan style sheltering people at home for months on end and taking away their chance to earn livelihood. I can't believe I'm actually agreeing with Trump but I think that the cure is starting to be worse than the problem itself. Most of my friends here in Hawaii are furloughed with no luck to get through with unemployment as the system is crushing. If it continues for months I am afraid we won't be so much a lesson for future generations about the flu pandemic but how once in the spring 2020 governments intentionally ruined the global economy self inflicting the poverty among millions of people. And then is this cure really helping us significantly? While Sweden death rate is worse than their neighbors it is still better than UK, France, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium and other countries that are in full lockdown since mid March. As to Hawaii, I hope that things will open up in June. Those I know that work in tourism industry are praying we will see visitors in July/August. Of course it will be much slower than previously, no doubts about it, but it's better to allow people to work and redirect the resources to protect the vulnerable than to be told to stay home and worry there soon might be no home at all."

"Honu no one is asking you to 'kill off an excess of young people'. I remember you mentioned you are in a risk group so especially people like you should stay at home and not even think of traveling any time soon. Will not enough people come to Hawaii? Sure, especially in the first months...but not letting anyone come is not the solution to this problem either. However, looking at the video posted by Islandgirl as well as seeing how many folks are breaking the quarantine here in Hawaii I am pretty sure many are antsy enough to start traveling and socializing again. I also would not call people who want to get back to work bold. I am pretty sure that the majority would love to honker down at home until vaccine is available and either work remotely or have unemployment extended to pay for the bills. Unfortunately that won't happen.. So I think it's more wanting to survive than being bold."
"You cannot always believe what you read in the news, but I read that there has never been an effective vaccine for this type of virus. Let’s pray for one, but the world cannot hunker down and wait for one. Isolate and protect the Vulnerable Individuals and more into a phase one opening. It is totally unfair to the residents of Hawaii to allow the Government to lock them down until the end of May. They people in authority need to be understand the data and carefully move forward."
Well isn’t that special. So much aloha. The point is the Governors are enjoying the power too much. I care about how other people in our country are being affected. The people whose lives are decimated by decisions made by politicians using really flawed models.

"CA Gov Gavin Newsom scolded people for going to the beach last weekend in Orange And Ventura County. It was very hot and people were over it. The boardwalk in Newport Beach was closed which I guess is ok for right now so people aren’t walking closely by each other but the beach was open. So there was a vote by the Newport Beach City Council tonight to vote on whether to close the beaches For the next 3 weekends. Hallelujah, they don’t cave to Newsom and the beaches will remain open. People are over it. We have been shut down for about 7 weeks. The curve is flattened. The onslaught didn’t happen. Let’s get back to work."

"Speaking on KHON2 this morning, Lt. Gov. Josh Green suggested that there is a ""high probability"" that the inter-island travel quarantine may be lifted prior to May 31 depending on new low case numbers. He did not mention an early lifting of the 14 day quarantine for out of state arrivals.He also stated that he is considering looking into a requirement that all arriving passengers into the State be required to provide a negative Covid-19 test result within three days of arrival."
"@kaukau - Was he suggesting a traveler would have needed a negative result in the three days prior to travel (meaning the traveler would both need to get a test and have the results back), or complete one within three days of arrival (presumably at state designated locations)?"
"Three days is BS because they can pick it up en-route from traveler NOT going to Hawaii. Except for West Coat, most US travelers connect. This may be feel good open up tourism but people who are picky will not be fooled and spend money on other things."
"""@kaukau - Was he suggesting a traveler would have needed a negative result in the three days prior to travel (meaning the traveler would both need to get a test and have the results back), or complete one within three days of arrival (presumably at state designated locations)?""What I gathered is that he's ""Considering looking into"" requiring that in order to board a flight bound for Hawai'i from both Mainland and international destinations, passengers - both visitor and resident - would have to provide proof that they are Covid-19 negative within 3 days prior to boarding.He also proposed that such a requirement would make Hawai'i known as the ""Safest place to visit and would put Hawai'i at the forefront of destinations for tourists wishing to fly and arrive without fear of contracting Covid-19."""
"So there's an 8am rebroadcast on KHON2 of Lt. Josh Green's earlier interview on right now. Here's an exact transcription:Kristine Uyeno: ""What about travel from other parts of the country, and then other countries as well?""Lt Gov. Josh Green: ""So I've begun to propose some comprehensive recommendations for the Governor and the team which would include testing for any individual which comes to the State Of Hawai'i. I believe that we can decrease our risk by 90 percent by having people have a negative test within three days of travel to Hawai'i."""
"I like that! I actually think this would be a good compromise to keep our community safe and at the same time to reopen for tourism. Hopefully testing will be available soon for purchase in the pharmacies. But that is something they should work on in the US regardless of reactivating tourism in Hawaii.Edited: 8:38 pm, April 29, 2020 "
"Current quick tests can have 15% false negatives. People who have it are told they don't and get in. Plus, it's like VD. I get a test showing I'm clean and then go out and...three days later...https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/f…"
"No one said it’s 100% safe. By requiring testing before boarding the plane to Hawaii they are hoping to decrease the risk by 90%.

South Korea has proven that this approach can work just fine.Edited: 4:57 am, April 30, 2020 "
"Hawaii tourism messaging should make it clear so as not to seem misleading, prompting skepticism. Good luck, really. Fortunately there are a lot of millennials who likely will travel. There may be winnowing of business unless they can pivot to the trifurcated market. Remember, people who are short of money can't buy orvtravel much during economic recovery.Imho you will be getting1) early rush of bargain hunters and rescheduled eager ones. But they are not going to be the $1000/day crowd. Most of those will wait. These early ones will be in condos, shopping at supermarkets and takeout, maybe one or two splurge tours or excursions.2) after we see if there is a rebound, there will be some higher end visitors resumingbregular patterns of travel. These will be lower risk folks but include higher end travelers going to luxury hotels, restaurants, tours. Not a splurge for them, these worked from home, did not lose much income, markets may have rebounded so not feeling poor, just careful.3) when there is effective treatment, antibody testing, and vaccine( s) your mainstream regular visitors will start returning, including ""formerly vulnerable."" The latter have good discretionary income, will have some saved foregone travel money to upscale when they resume traveling. So better lodging better restaurants, more shopping and quality excursions.2) may be 2021-22.3) might be 2 years off. Problem is if seeking 1) Hawaii gets an influx of rebound covid from mainland places, back to square 0 and everything takes longer with worse impact."
"Four visitors were arrested in the last two days for violating quarantine restrictions: three on Oahu and one on Maui. Two were reported by their hotel after being seen returning to their hotel with shopping bags and take out, one was spotted jet skiing on Oahu's North shore, and a Maui tourist was arrested for repeatedly violating quarantine restrictions.I think it may be safely assumed that many others are doing the same but have not been caught.Would some sort of pre-arrival screening eliminate the need for quarantining and enforcement? That would be nice."
"Problem is the travel mingling with people of unknown habits from various places, asymptomatic spreaders, pre-symptom spreaders. By the time you have a fever you are symptomatic. Vital load peaks before that.The ultra rich sheltering on Lanai fly private, quarantine in. Ice surroundings with 4S delivery.Edited: 11:52 am, April 30, 2020 "
In the absence of effective pre-arrival screening possible considerations include extending the quarantine past the May 31 deadline with stricter enforcement measures including designated quarantine sites at the arriver's expense - not one's home or hotel or accommodation of preference - among others like ankle bracelets. And this is as we begin to ease restrictions on businesses etc.
"kaukau you sound like you're ok with the possible considerations in your last post effectively turning Hawaii into a police state?

"I've seen a lot of people in the water at Wahikuli lately. Now that they opened the parking lots, it will prob get more.Golf courses were allowed to open--under some pretty strict rules. Waiehu and Kaanapali were both pretty busy."
"“Visitor arrivals on Friday climbed to 223!; Hawai'i lacks a strong program for tracking tourists(.)”The fact that they know the visitor numbers is a huge advantage for Hawaii, though. Many states have quarantine rules in effect; for the most part it’s entirely impossible to carry them out.~ Colleen"

SW he's here just read your comment. All he said was WOW! Walked out of the room......That's what I say....WOW.By the way Hawaii is a state not a country.
"Hi Fireball! >>> ""kaukau I'd like to see you tell him in person that he can't visit Hawaii a state in the union of the United States.""<<<Seems like a strange request, Fireball, but if it would make you happy, I'll tell him in person that he can't visit Hawaii. Then you can watch him laugh in my face at the absurdity of that statement.Everyone has a right to travel freely between states as long as they follow the rules. For instance, when entering Hawaii you have to declare animals and agricultural products. Rules don't have to be laws to be enforced. For instance, submitting to TSA inspection before boarding a plane is a rule, not a law. By entering a TSA checkpoint you have agreed to follow the rules. If you don't want to follow the rules, nobody's forcing you to enter the checkpoint: you can take a bus or a train or a boat.Can't take a bus or train to Hawaii? Then you have to fly or take a boat. And if you choose to fly, the first rule you have to follow is submitting to TSA inspection. That's the point. Nobody's forcing anyone to travel to Hawaii. Hawaii requests that all those that enter please follow the rules. Now we have a whole new set of rules because of this Corona virus that we all have to follow, please.Here's a rule, actually a law, in Hawaii, that I bet very few readers of this forum know about: It is illegal to keep a hamster as a pet in Hawaii. You can look it up!"
"Hey, Kaukau..........don't forget ferrets are illegal too....and iguanas, plus some other nasty things called snakes :-0!I'm sure glad the animal quarantine laws got changed over the years. It was a lot easier to import my last couple of GSDs than my first dogs.....even though the last several came from Germany (one under 4 months waiting period in WA., one 4 months in CA). That was during the first titer/KSU process years.Now it's only a 30 day waiting period-which is also subject to change under some circumstance. If only we had a titer test for COVID-19!Edited: 8:18 pm, May 03, 2020 "
With my stimulus check I'm going out to buy 2 Hamsters guess what I'm going to name them.Wrong!I'm going to name them Bill for The Bill of Rights and George as in Washington.
"Ok, I'll bite... So Fireball, what's you problem again? Are you mad that people on a small island chain in the middle of the pacific ocean, with limited access to medical equipment as well as medical facilities, and one of the worst population health indexes in the country, are asking people to refrain from visiting so their health system does not get overwhelmed? Is that the reason for all the complaining?Just trying to understand, as I haven't read all the posts.. And I have no idea of what a pie has to do with it... Or hamsters...Edited: 9:00 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Cris my compliant is with the cavalier way that individuals will throw away the rights afford us by the constitution and bill of rights.As Americans It is our right to question the way we are governed if you do not exercise those rights then you'll find yourself living in a police state.Hawaii is a state in the union of the United States of America I have as much right to question the laws of that state as the one I live in. These passed several weeks Federal courts have blocked governors of one state from not allowing citizens of a neighboring state from crossing its borders or pulling over citizens that have a certain plate from another state, that's profiling and is illegal.If the argument is Hawaii doesn't have medical resources to handle a pandemic it's citizens should be holding their government officials accountable for not being prepared. In California we are pushing back our governor's dictatorship rules. Rural counties those with little or no cases are say enough we're reopening on Monday. Orange county is pushing back the governors closing of their beaches. Mainly cause its a conservative county dealing with a progressive governor who has illegally made a billion dollar purchase of masks from China. He will not release details of the purchase including the names of individuals who might benefit financial from this deal. He didn't get any bids from US companies or companies located in California that pisses me off. A billion dollars of our taxpayer money going to China....Oh some negative things were said about Hamsters they're so cute and I like pie."
"I see. Thanks. If you allow me, the problem is that during the pandemic, holding governments accountable for not having enough access to medical care does not do much. Nothing ca be done fast enough. Even well prepared states/countries were never prepared for the medical needs created by this new virus. Honestly, no one would ever be, because to be prepared for such an increase in medical needs would require unused medical resources in times of no pandemic, which economically/financially does not make sense.So, governments are left with no easy choice: try to hold to the virus with social distancing (the only thing that holds it back for now) or let thousands/millions die. Neither are good choices for politicians, or the people. But holding the virus back for some time by social distancing (not forever) buys time to discover a treatment or organize the country/state in a way that all losses (economy losses and losses of life) can be minimized to the extent possible. If I may ask, what would you do if you were the governor of Hawaii? Or CA?"
">>>Just as visiting certain countries or places means complying with their local laws....<<<Hawaii isn't another country, it is an American state.>>>Because the public often confuses privileges with rights.<<<Travel within the United States isn't a privilege and you don't lose your civil liberties when you do. Every state has the same obligations for due process."
">>>Hawaii requests that all those that enter please follow the rules. Now we have a whole new set of rules because of this Corona virus that we all have to follow, please.<<<The ""rules"" cannot overrule the Constitutional guarantees of civil liberties."
">>>So, governments are left with no easy choice: try to hold to the virus with social distancing<<<Confining someone to a room for 14 days isn't ""social distancing"".>>>If I may ask, what would you do if you were the governor of Hawaii?<<<Take the temperature of every arrival, require everyone to wear face masks in public, practice social distancing in restaurants and bars, contact trace infected people, screen every resident,"
"Cris you seem reasonable.My best friend is in a highly placed position last week during a conference call with state leaders he asked what is the plans going forward to deal with the virus if it returns in the fall. He said the call went silent. No one had an answer that they haven't started with planning for the next wave of the virus which most experts say is going to happen.In the beginning our governor did a good job of issuing rules to stop the spread of the virus, but is having a difficult time transitioning from shut down mode to reopening the state.He's treating the state with a blanket policy and the state is to large for that type of policy. I own a business in rural Butte county we have not had a reported case of covid in over 30 days and no deaths related to the virus, yet we are under the same shutter in place rule as the bay area of California(SF, San Jose) which is high density population.The governor needs to secede decision making to the counties located in areas with little or no cases to make the decisions on when to open up."
Why do Californians always want to control Hawaii?
"""The ""rules"" cannot overrule the Constitutional guarantees of civil liberties.""Sure they can: Break the rules of law, go to jail and lose your liberty and right to travel. Break the rules of the court, get a gag order and lose your right to freedom of speech. Happens all the time.""Travel within the United States isn't a privilege and you don't lose your civil liberties when you do.""Getting on an airplane is a privelege, not a right. When you land in Hawaii and the government tells you there are some rules in place due to a declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY, if you don't want to follow those rules, you can get right back on that airplane and go back where you came from, if you so choose. Your right to free travel is unrestricted.Look, if you feel so strongly about the situation where I live, and want to make your voice heard beyond the boundaries of this thread and forum, I honestly urge you to call my Mayor and as a concerned visitor tell him your concerns. I'm not lying or talking crap. Seriously, I respect your opinion, but the Mayor can do something about it, and maybe give a clearer explanation for what's going on here than I can. County of Maui Mayor's Office: (808) 270-7855"
"Yell ""Fire "" in a theater and find your okole in jail.One of the oldest, and most used Con Law teaching cases."
I just find it highly unlikely the current administration will toss out huge dollars to states. How is Hawaii planning to pay its bills. That is what I do not understand. Pretty clear police are not welcoming a massive pay cut.
Agricultural inspections are not for people entering Hawaii. If it were it would be for entering.A 14 day quarantine because you may have a disease. ? Why not one because you may be a mass murderer ?Why not one because you may be a bad driver and cause deaths on the road?

Cops can consider themselves lucky as they are still working. 40% of our state is unemployed!!And our governor spends time trying to figure out how to catch a few morons who break quarantine instead of preparing the state to open up while at the same time protecting the vulnerable.
"The definition of moron depends on how many people you've lost.Back on topic: like it or not, all arrivals to Hawaii have to quarantine for 14 days. That includes residents. If you don't want to abide by the rules, don't come here. Easy."
"Fireball and others who disapprove of Hawaii’s approach, are you aware of and as concerned about other states which have quarantines in place? ~ Colleen"
"Interesting question, Colleen. Caused me to do a quick internet search ""What states have quarantine orders"", and here's what I found: The governors of at least 40 states have issued stay-at-home orders. And nearly 30 are discouraging interstate travel by announcing quarantine requirements or recommendations for travelers or people who live there traveling home from other states. Alaska, Florida and Hawaii were the first states to institute state-to-state quarantine requirements for travelers, and many other states have followed suit."
"Yep, kaukau. I’ve mentioned multiple times that Hawaii isn’t the only state with a quarantine in place. It is the state, though, that can most easily enforce the order, followed by Alaska. ~ Colleen"
"Agricultural forms are filled out for those arriving in Hawaii. Inspections are done when leaving. Not sure the truth of this but I was told the reason for ag inspections when leaving were due to laws on the mainland, especially Cali. Makes sense because Canadians who fly direct from Hawaii to Canada don't go through ag inspection."
"Well, that opens up nearly 30 other States in the Trip Advisor United States forum for our members to voice their displeasure with the handling of the Coronavirus pandemic.A wonderful opportunity to stay meaningfully engaged during this shelter-at- home period!"
"""Agricultural forms are filled out for those arriving in Hawaii. Inspections are done when leaving.""Absolutely correct. The fact that they inspect bags leaving but not entering our State is a source of dissatisfaction among our USDA agriculture inspectors. Well aware of our State's vulnerability to invasive pests, they consider the lack of inspection of ARRIVING domestic travelers a kabuki theater approach to controlling the introduction of pests INTO our State."
"Exactly, kaukau! Alas, it seems people aren’t terribly interested in, say, Montana’s quarantine requirement. Perhaps because they don’t know about it, or it’s largely irrelevant to them, given the impossibility to enforce. Again, Hawaii has it good thanks to air-only arrival. ~ Colleen"
"In a follow-up report this morning to the arrest of a California couple arrested over the weekend for violating the States quarantine requirement, KGMB news anchor Steve Uyehara ended with the statement: ""So visitors: You have been warned. You come here, you follow the rules.""No restriction to travel. No violation of constitutional rights. But you have to follow the rules. Can we make it any clearer?"
"Hey Scott:The issue is that taking temperatures upon arrival does not guarantee the person is not infected, it just shows whether symptoms are present or not. Screening every resident is impossible, at least screening with a Sars-Cov-2 test, as it fairly laborious, so much that most tests from samples from Hawaii were or still are done on the mainland. The islands just can't perform all the tests needed (the rest of the country can't either, but on the islands it's worse). Clearly, no easy answers available to contain this pandemic.Therefore, the 14 days quarantine rule is a desperate attempt by the government to keep people away and prevent infection rates from increasing. It is a deterrent, in the absence of anything else that can be done. Lots of people that can work from home and can afford to do so would be traveling to Hawaii to work from there, I even thought of that before coming to my senses. Lots of other people, potential carriers, would be taking vacations there now to take advantage of low rates and cheap flights. Increased number of visitors would soon translate into more and more cases, and if/when things got out of control, there would be no way to transport people (locals or visitors) to other hospitals (or morgues) in nearby cities/states.The quarantine is just that, a desperate action to save the people of Hawaii in the absence of anything better.Maybe this argument changes your mind(s) from focussing on civil liberties to focusing on how desperate things could get on a small island chain in the middle of the Pacific.>>>If I may ask, what would you do if you were the governor of Hawaii?<<<Take the temperature of every arrival, require everyone to wear face masks in public, practice social distancing in restaurants and bars, contact trace infected people, screen every resident,"
"“The islands just can't perform all the tests needed (the rest of the country can't either, but on the islands it's worse).”I hear you, Cris, although FYI there are many states more challenged than Hawaii as far as testing is concerned. Ultimately, of course, we aren’t going to test our way out of this situation. There simply will never be enough fast, reliable tests for that to be a magic bullet.~ Colleen"
"Hi Coleen, Maybe in number of tests needed now per number of residents, but with regards to the machines and supplies (qPCR machines, RNA extraction kits, etc...) needed for the test, I don't think there is a state with less of those than Hawaii. I could be wrong though."
"Cris, in terms of tests conducted per capita, there are many, many states, including Colorado, testing at a lower rate than Hawaii.~ Colleen"
"Labs here have been processing the tests and have results very quickly. There is a lab at the hospital on Kauai that does processing plus a couple,of other independent labs. The amount of tests we have is a different story. Not too many people on Kauai have been tested because there haven't been any ""hot spots"" and no new positive results in almost a month. Testing is ramping up here on Kauai though starting with all our medical personal, first responders and support staff. Antibody tests are also available."
"Thank you Hawaii locals and for being nice about things.Catching up through, as a Californian, i'm sort of embarrassed by the selfish and incorrect assumptions about constitutional rights by some of the definite minority.Can't wait to return when you guys are ready."
"Hey, don't worry about it. Scott has been posting on theses forums forever and the others aren't newbies either. We get that they are upset, rolls right off my back cause I don't really care what folks that don't live here think about what or why we do things in Hawaii. I have family members that were born in Southern California, my grandpa, along with his young family, moved to Californina from Oklahoma. Guess when, the 30's!! Literal grapes of wrath story."

"The park reopenings have gone pretty well--even a few feral pigs enjoyed it last Friday:https:/…Seeing feral pigs at Keopuolani isn't rare.........they've damn near overtaken parts of it totally, over the last year. They are vicious and aggressive--always keep your distance and don't challenge them, if you see them somewhere. The Mayor has indicated that he expects to reopen retail operations soon, on a limited basis. I think that would be great, and maybe in another few weeks or month, some restaurants can reopen too."
Kapalua Golf (Bay and Plantation) courses are reopening on a limited basis:https:/…Note the requirement to show proof that one has been on Maui at least 15 days :-).
">>>Why do people who moved to Hawaii, especially Maui, from another state or country, suddenly think they are Hawaiians with Hawaii's best interests at heart rather than their own, narrow interests.<<<To which narrow interests are you referring?"

The difficult part would be in getting people to show up to be tested. There are sufficient people in the state to conduct the tests. If you want to do it faster, you can import more testers from the mainland."
">>>To which narrow interests are you referring<<<Keeping people off ""my"" island (now that I am here, now is the time to end development and tourism, it is ruining ""my"" island {now that I am here})."

"Could you people please take your quarrels and pissing matches to another thread---like start your own? It gets really old............from the very first post, the issue has ALWAYS been IF YOU CHOOSE TO VISIT.The Muppet stole Maui's slogan: ""Safer at Home"", but has announced he will allow much more retail to open Thursday. I think it's a good move. Many will stay closed until they see how it goes, but others are really eager to try and open up ASAP.Restaurants are still a few weeks or a month away, IMO.....and I think we will not see large events like luau for a year or more.https:/…Cris, thanks for the in depth test info/answer. I think it might help people understand how complicated this is for the near and far future.Edited: 6:20 pm, May 05, 2020 "
"Luau's are probably going to have to move away from buffett style I would think, whenever they open... its a good first step though, you are ahead of us in Nevada! Our Gov treats Reno, like we are Las Vegas.... and we are not! We have much less cases that Vegas! It will be interesting to see how Hawaii does.--Lori"
I think in general us mainlanders are more concerned about the economic impacts and see the need to move ahead. Not really a question of rights or facisim. If states and cities start declaring bankruptcy we all get hurt.
"The problem for restaurants is the same everywhere....very low profit margins. Peter Merriman gave an interview recently and mentioned being unsure how/what would come about for his and other restaurants. Mark Ellman has said already that he is re-doing Frida's totally. Different menu, concept, and lower prices. I think we will see more of the takeout/food truck style places for a while at least.Luau are tremendously expensive to produce. I can't see one being affordable if the social distancing rules and served food were all enforced. People think they are expensive now....I would expect tickets to double in price.I think the quarantine for arrivals has a very strong chance of lasting until July. So much depends on how the reopening of other states goes....and already there are problems there, with increasing reports of more cases. Whether the guv likes it or not, Maui's mayor and Kaua'i's at least are more than prepared to call for more strict rules FAST if there are problems.Cris's points about the testing are so important. Those and the incubation period are 2 huge issues for any loosening or dropping of the quarantine."
"Interesting! I'm surprised malls & retail are opening up on Thursday already. I'm glad that isn't happening here yet, but when people hear what's going on elsewhere, it tends to encourage more moving about & activity.~ Colleen"
">>>Keeping people off ""my"" island (now that I am here, now is the time to end development and tourism, it is ruining ""my"" island {now that I am here).<<<Thanks for the swift reply, Scott. When I moved here 31 years ago opinion polls had it 60/40 that tourism brought more benefits than harm to the Islands. Today, 31 years later, that ratio has flip-flopped. That's not a condemnation of tourism and development per se, but a criticism of the effect of the continued unrestrained, unlimited increase of development and tourist numbers. With some notable exceptions like the H3 on Oahu and the Piilani Highway on Maui, most of our roads were not built to carry the number of vehicles at speeds we see today. We're driving two lane undivided roads like they are divided interstates, but all too often at a bumper to bumper crawl when they exceed their capacity. There are many times when driving between Lahaina and Kahului at a crawl, there is no accident or reason for the tie up other than that the number of cars on the road has exceeded the road's capacity to carry them. These islands don't extend past the horizon. They actually have a carrying capacity. In many areas: water, recycling, waste management. The list goes on. We don't live in a state where development can continue unfettered into the vast prairie or desert.Keeping our islands from being degraded by unrestrained development is not a narrow self serving viewpoint, but in fact will keep them a beautiful, welcoming place for residents and visitors alike. Visitors deserve as great an experience here as do residents. I hope we can manage our State to the benefit of residents and visitors alike.Your statement that we want to ""end tourism and development"" is a false assumption. That we want to manage it so that we and future generations of residents and visitors may continue to enjoy the beauty of Hawaii would be far closer to the truth."
"Colleen, if we didn't have a pretty low number of tourists--I don't think this would be happening already. I'm sure there will be a few new cases after the malls open up, along with the other businesses being allowed to open Thursday.........but I don't think it will be anything like what it would be if we didn't have the quarantine.It will also take time for some to open-and some may not yet--feeling that it will cost them too much to open for too few customers. It will be interesting, you're right!"
#115 --- That is some serious looking big Pigs. I don't think I'd be casually meandering by them on the walking trail. More likely to give them a nice wide berth!Just how aggressive are they normally? They venture into the Park areas often during times when people are out and about?
"I tried to find a thread I did with pics of some pigs at the Westin last summer...couldn't find it. Due to the fires and the drought, the pigs have come down and into residential/farmed areas. The two in the pic aren't even that big. They are pretty bold--and very aggressive if it's rutting season or it's a sow with piglets. The boars can hit 450 lbs.People are cheering madly about the partial reopenings--LOL, I bet Thursday through about Sunday will be like kids let out to play. I'll be ducking and driving home from work!"
"If everyone is quarantining 14 days and residents have been here longer. Why are residents not allowed more freedom? If 14 days are used to discover symptoms who exactly will be spreading disease after that period of time.? People deserve a reasonable explanation for iron fisted rules other than ""cause I say so"""
"Joe, the idea is the less people out milling about-whether tourists or residents-the better to NOT spread the virus. And it seems to have worked, to some degree-yes? Despite some deaths and two large clusters (one on Maui, one on the Big Island)....Hawaii has overall done pretty well so far. But there is also the known fact that the virus is much more widespread than thought, EVERYWHERE. And since at any time, people may be infected but asymptomatic, the ""lockdown"" orders were to try and keep people apart and keep them from spreading it.Residents and tourists who are not under quarantine have been allowed to shop for food and essential items, get exercise outside, swim in the ocean, and for some of us residents---work :-). That's been the case since the beginning.Edited: 10:36 pm, May 05, 2020 "
">>>When I moved here 31 years ago opinion polls had it 60/40 that tourism brought more benefits than harm to the Islands. Today, 31 years later, that ratio has flip-flopped.<<<And I think that is my point. A lot of the 60 percent ""no tourists/no development"" mindset of today comes from people who didn't live there 31 ones years ago. I have quoted many times how Maui now has more people born outside the state and country than it does born on Maui.I'd love to turn the clock back 40 years in So Cal, my parents want to turn the clock back 75 years in So Cal. Orange County gets more tourists in a year than Maui gets in 4 years combined. Add in the 75 million who visit LA and San Diego, and we are well over 100 million a year (although there is certainly some level of overlap). I know how quality of life can diminish due to tourism and development, but I'll suffer that rather than creep into elitism."
"Hi Scott! Your ""No tourists/no development"" mindset actually is the mantra on Molokai, not Maui. On Molokai they sport bumper stickers that say ""Welcome to Molokai. Spend money and go home."" When a small upscale cruise ship docked there and unloaded a few vans to tour the island, the residents dropped trees across the road to block their way. That cruise ship quickly departed and never returned. They tolerate the 6000 tourists that venture there per year at best, and hate the sight of them at worst. Molokai would be happy with no tourists. Zero. Nada.They will never let Molokai turn into Maui, and Maui is now going to try not to turn into Oahu. Tourists are still welcome here on Maui.Edited: 2:47 am, May 06, 2020 "
What're the chances of the quarantine/lockdown being extended past May 31st? My husband and I have booked a trip down there for June and we're really looking forward to it...
"Many big hotels don't open until July 1 and there is a talk that the quarantine might remain in place until end of June. This is a rumor though, nothing has been officially said about extending it past May 31. I think we will get some clarification soon, but I am afraid that it's quite realistic that your trip might overlap with the quarantine."
"Stupid, stupid guv Muppet did it again!!!! He has changed his order about retail reopening:https:/…"
"KITV4 this morning reports: ""Hawaii has some of the lowest numbers of cases of Covid -19 cases in the country and a new study shows that efforts across the state to flatten the curve have been tougher than most....It turns out Hawaii's rules are some of the strictest in the country...If Hawaii is on one end of the spectrum, the state on the other end is South Dakota, the state in that study that had the least restrictive measures. While Hawaii still has restaurants boarded up, South Dakota was the only state that had no restrictions on restaurants or bars at all. Interestingly enough, both their governor and governor David Ige of Hawaii both ranked lowest in approval ratings in terms of handling the covid-19 crisis in their respective states.""Damned if you do, damned if you don't, cant win for losing, and no good deed goes unpunished."
"OR, try a middle-ground strategy with consistent communication."
"South Dakota also doesn't average 30,000 tourist coming into the state each day!!"
"Hannah, the odd's of your trip going as planned are almost zero, even if it does the restrictions placed on you might not be worth it. Like I've said almost since this all started, July will be the first real month of any tourism opening up. And yes, it's somewhat political, the governor knows he needs to give business some small slice of the busy summer tourist season or else the economy will be next to impossible to repair. Like here in California, there are many ripples effects to this SIP order which will takes months to fully play out, and it won't be pretty when it does. And for the record, I'm not saying either governor is right or wrong at this point. Time will tell."
As long as he and other government workers get paid and the comptroller isn'tknocking on his door it will last longer. About 40% unemployment in the state so tax revenue will dryup. Property taxes paid by people not earning income will slow down too.. Just saying flatten the curve without putting any real number to the goal is useless. All those Car rental fees and transient fees not coming in.
">>>South Dakota also doesn't average 30,000 tourist coming into the state each day!!<<<You are right. South Dakota averaged 39,726 tourists coming into the state each day in 2019.https:/…"
Let's move this over tourism negative impacts discussion over to SW's Overtourism/Negative Impacts thread and keep this thread about quarantine and lockdown issues. What do you say? I'll meet you over there!
"As I mentioned elsewhere, *supposedly* it is prohibited to rent a car if you are under quarantine.......it's in the Muppet's latest proclamation. Problem? Seems nobody mentioned that to the agencies or media. Oops.Some parts of Makena (Big Beach) and Poli Poli are reopening, for limited hours and use."
">>>As I mentioned elsewhere, *supposedly* it is prohibited to rent a car if you are under quarantine.......<<<So down by Cut Mountain we saw a yellow Mustang convertible, top down, four folks enjoying the beautiful trade wind weather, cruising up the road. Haven't seen tourists in a rental car like that in six weeks. Were they breaking quarantine? Should they have been rented a car in the first place? Who knows?"
"LOL, I have seen plenty of them in jeeps and convertibles. The rental car thing is new-it's in yesterday's sermon from the mount........."
Rejected! Six visitors who violated quarantine rules are sent back. https:/…
"Yep, I posted about that on the Kaua'i thread.So much for being special, LOL. I hope they NEVER come back."
"So I have a trip to Hawaii, the big island on July 1st, from what I've read the lockdown will be lifted May 31st but my question is will the 14 day new arrival quarantine still be in effect July 1st? Please if anyone has info reply, it'll be greatly appreciated."

"I am a little confused. Hawaii continues to have excellent COVID 19 infection and death rates. The state has moved to a phased reopening. (Informally) They are opening things slowly and carefully. It would seem like the Lock Down order is not really applicable. This is a good thing for residents. I wonder if the lack of a formal phased reopening plan is political? Or maybe it is just a reluctance to advance planning in general. Of course the quarantine for returning residents and visitors is still necessary IMO. If I was in charge, I would leave the quarantine in place until health screening and testing of all arrivals is implemented. Or until the infection rates are low in the mainland."
"There is nothing ""informal"" about a phased reopening. It is happening now. Safer at home is still in effect. Not sure why you think there is no formal reopening plan. Political how?No one know how long the visitor quarantine will last after the May 31st date. I'm waiting for that answer too. Most folks seem to think it will be July."
"So the Lockdown has been replaced by Safer at home? I should learn to get up to speed before I post. I have not visited this forum for a few days. So the Governor has issued a four phase reopening plan with defined steps and criteria?Thanks.Edited: 11:11 am, May 09, 2020 "

"""New rules for quarantining Hawaii visitors didn’t stop more from coming Friday""https:/…From the Honolulu Star Advertiser article referenced above, new rules include Gov. David Ige’s latest proclamation banning rental car companies from renting to anyone who is under a 14-day quarantine, and the HTA asking hotels to issue single-use room keys to quarantining guests and the DOT to improve the way they screen arriving passengers at the airport and make compliance checks.Single use room keys should make the quarantine a little more real to those guests."
"Yes, the ""lockdown"" has been replaced by ""safer at home."" Phased openings began on Kauai and the island of Hawaii a few days ago. Maui and Oahu this coming week. It's what they are calling a Kamaaina opening. Meaning for folks who live here. It will be slow and methodical. If cases of the viruse rise into double digits, they'll reconsider. Expectations are that the visitor quarantine will be expanded past the 31st of May but there has been no official announcement made."
"When the language appears to offensive just change the wording.Happens all the time with unpopular subjects. Many follow,"
"Joe, it's not just semantics. The ""safer at home"" motto was started here on Maui. It's to describe the fact that yes--more things are starting to open, but people should remember they are still ""safer at home"". In other words, just because a mall will open tomorrow, you don't need to go there every day all day long. Go, get your stuff (if stores are even open), and go back home."
"Many states have been using ""safer at home"" for their openings. It's nothing unique to Hawaii ."
We have: Stay Home for Nevada!!
"Sorry, I should have been more specific: As far as the term in Hawaii--it started on Maui :-). Better?I see the UK is going to do a quarantine on air arrivals. Not many details yet, plus the obvious q of the Chunnel and other means of transportation....like trains and cars, for example. Could be interesting.The State Senate group for CV-19 has been pretty clear they want the quarantine to run through June. I think it will. There are just too many chances for a huge upswell otherwise, of new cases."
"2 more cases on Oahu today, plus several over the last few days. I don't think there's any doubt the quarantine will be continued into June. They are developing a new form and new procedures for arrivals, which would be silly if the quarantine was going away in just over 2 weeks. Then again--the guv has done some pretty stupid things........and the State Leg isn't perfect either, LOL.Mention was made today about opening up interisland travel ""in the next few weeks"". I would expect to see the interisland quarantine dropped for RESIDENTS in June."
"One woman arrested over the weekend, and five Quarantourists sent back home, on Maui alone.They're getting serious finally."
Just saw this. Travel quarantine will not be lifted on May 31. https:/…
"Olli, it's not up to Victorino, though.....it's up to the Muppet guv. I think Victorino was making his position very public to let Ige know where he stood......like it or not. I think Kaua'i's mayor will do the same. BI mayor Harry Kim will prob do whatever Ige says.There's no way the state will have enough people and tests ready in 2 weeks. NO way."
"Didn't know that but now I know.Too bad with huge shortage of tests in Hawaii. We don't have the best health care here, but pretty much anybody can get tested here and results come back in 24-48 hours. We do have major federal lab in town though so that probably helps."
"Olli, tests on Maui are pretty readily available--we have a good, aggressive record. Oahu, same thing. Kaua'i not and BI not.....But that's not testing a ton of tourists every day, on multiple flights on each island....that's a whole different scenario. And that is what ""no quarantine"" would need.The issue is getting the ""instant"" tests. They have started to use one at HNL-it caught an infected person yesterday, in fact. But rolling those out on a large scale.....well, I don't think Winnipeg could right now either.Edited: 3:14 pm, May 13, 2020 "
Got it. I hope we all know more in 2-3 weeks as many locations are opening up. Winnipeg can handle everybody who wants to travel here. Testing both of them shouldn't be a problem ;-)
"LOLOLOL, Olli--I nearly spit water on my keyboard.........we'll see. I just posted a new thread about the state's latest great plan."
"So, Kaua'i is going out there....they are reopening their beaches this Friday for a ""trial run"". They are also extending the quarantine through June--my q on that is did they ask Mr. Muppet??? He has been very insistent that only he gets to issue edicts. I'm thinking it was a bargain between him and Kawakami......since Ige wanted to use Kaua'i as the guinea pig before.Victorino had indicated early today that he might reopen our beach parks more this weekend. I think he prob will if we stay slow on cases, and once open, people don't get stupid.Case wants the FAA to test people *before* they board planes to Hawaii:https:/…But as said before, this won't catch everyone or people who are asymptomatic......unless they get the really, really high grade tests. Just a temp check means nothing, and most tests aren't high enough quality to be truly definitive.I suspect the FAA will say no anyway. That will in turn give us more reason to extend the quarantine."
Do you think we will be okay for july 4th?
"I truly don't know........but I would guess ""maybe"". Not much help, huh?They may extend the quarantine all the way into the fall........or at least through July & August. No one can say now-because truly, no one knows.If you do visit in July, please realize that even if there isn't a quarantine--Maui won't be very ""exciting"". Most activities and tours will still be closed is my best thought. Very few restaurants will be open much either."
"Won't be a fireworks show in Lahaina, garans."
I agree....no way they will be doing any large events like that on Maui.
"Was the quarantine for Maui through The end of June , it’s what I heard today"
"That decision hasn't yet been made, for Maui. The quarantine for *Kaua'i* was extended to the end of June."
"Here's a link to the article describing more parks opening, tennis, and pickleball courts as well:https:/…No gathering (like picnics, cookouts) still, and NO sunbathing on the beaches........exercise only."
