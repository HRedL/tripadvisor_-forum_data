"We are family of 4 (2 kids) looking for a short trip through nature, away from city and crowd to play it safe during this critical timing .. thinking about a road trip toward Half moon Bay from Los Angeles. What would be some good short stops to make along the way, not to stay over night, just to get a snap shot, have short break and Pass throughThanks"
"We’re getting a lot of these posts so it’s hard to tell if they are all genuine. Do you mean Half Moon Bay south of San Francisco? If you are planning on doing this via highway 1 it isn’t doable in a day. You would need to stay at least one night. Let us know your route, how many nights and when you’re planning on doing taking this trip.Edited: 12:37 am, July 28, 2020 "
"What route are you taking?If Highway 1, you're already looking at a 9 hour drive without stops. You'll only have time for fuel and food stops. Really needs it's own overnight stop en route: Like Cambria (Midway)Be sure to fill up in San Luis Obispo. Gas stations are few and far between along the Big Sur coast and VERY expensive. Restrooms also rare.Short stops?The elephant seal rookeryMcWay Falls at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State ParkSuggest packing a picnic because the few eateries along that route will likely be packed with travelers.Edited: 12:39 am, July 28, 2020 "
"away from city and crowd to play it safe...Half the state seems to think like you, in addition to people from Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada. So you won't be playing it safe. Half Moon Bay is full of people, esp on the weekends.To play it safe, stay home."
"I'd suggest making the following stops (arranged in order while driving from LA to Half Moon Bay):1. Elephant seal vista point - https://goo.gl/maps/gcDZbGqpH6RTX4Tt62. McWay falls - https://goo.gl/maps/rkuqtCv6my1Q37uX63. Pfeiffer beach (scenic BUT off route) - https://goo.gl/maps/ttXsmjgRBDkGkx5964. Riverside Inn for lunch. It's very open and should be safe I guess. I personally love the creekside chairs to dip feet in cold water and relax - https://goo.gl/maps/p4CWJpMJY1m69vmK85. Finally, Bixby bridge - https://goo.gl/maps/cwtiAbaRtH6PcPxC9"
"You will not have enough time to make so many stops without staying overnight from Los Angeles to Half Moon Bay via Highway 1. Especially with kids. The distance is ~430 miles to drive. 9 hours are very optimistic an estimate as driving time. There are traffic in Los Angeles area, Santa Barbara, slow-down in San Luis Obispo, traffic possibly in Monterey and definitely in Santa Cruz. You will not make it to ""lunch"" in Big Sur. Sorry.My estimate on the driving time overhead is 11 hours and you factor in stopping time on top of that. So if you start at 8 am in LA, you will be at Half Moon Bay at around 9 to 10 pm."
"scincalifornia, I was just going to say the same thing. A lot of first time posters asking short, very general, slightly 'off' questions about travel. Hmm..."
"Normally I wouldn’t recommend driving from LA to HMB via 1 in a day but the less exposure you have to others the better. Yes HMB isn’t exactly quiet. The Bay Area heads there for their getaway spot. Hopefully you’re coming during the week after Labor Day. Highway 1 traffic has been just as bad this summer as any. The River Inn is lovely but I think you’ll barely have time for the stops Kibbles suggested. 9 hours is generous with out stops. With a couple stops the drive could be 10 hours without traffic.  Lunch could take well over an hour so I’d pack a picnic. Keep in mind restrooms are few on the coast. You may want to plan for somewhere closer this year and save they long highway 1 drive for when you can fully enjoy it.Edited: 1:34 am, July 28, 2020 "
A likely troll. Easy to find nature closer to LA. Consider that San Franciscans in search of nature might make Half Moon Bay pretty crowded.
Erica T. Yes it’s hard to know if it’s people really wanting to getaway or not. I do know we’ve had a very busy tourist season despite Covid so it seems people want to travel anyway.
Yes one never knows who or what is behind the screen.Kids may like Solvang and Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo
Thank you will definitely look into it
Good points! Thank you
"Valid points, thank you"
"Thank you you have valid points, will consider for sure"
"“…away from city and crowd to play it safe...”This is what scads of city and urban residents want to do these days – escape to some quiet, uncrowded rural area where it feels safe. And all these people flocking to beaches, forests, quaint small towns, etc. to “get away from the crowds"" are generating so much crowding that many locals in rural areas no longer feel safe in their own communities."
There is a lot to see and do within easy reach of LA. No reason to drag your germs through smaller communities that have limited medical resources. Stay home. Stay safe. Let others stay that way too.
"^^^^What's the difference between taking ""germs"" to Pomona or Malibu and taking them to Half Moon Bay?"
"Because an overnight stay would not be required. And probably a lot easier to take food to picnic rather than having to rely on restaurant meals. Nor having to use public bathrooms along the way. All of which are logical, but I suppose you enjoy being argumentative. Some county health departments are asking people not to travel long distances."
"Taken from State of California webpage re: Coronavirus “Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus.”See that’s the difference . A few hundred miles."
#17. There is absolutely no use in trying to explain the obvious.
I don't recall asking for your opinion on the matter? Or anyones for that matter:)
"Look , there ain't no need to poke fun at my 12 years education clear up ta 6th grade!"
Jim R. are you also talin? You seem to be answering responses to your motorcycle post and vice versa.
"scincalifornia, yes I think you are correct. Also #21 makes no contextual sense."
Love it. The sock puppets can't keep themselves straight.
Man this is a tough room! LOLKinda snotty!
"Since your kids probably won't be getting any education during the fall( not that they alread were) LA Purisma Mission would be good.Edited: 10:39 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"“ Man this is a tough room! LOLKinda snotty!” If you could keep your questions and responses straight I think it would be helpful for everyone. Snotty? Someone went out of there way to find an open hike in campsite at one of the best campgrounds on the Central Coast, in one of the most popular spots on the coast, in the middle of the summer, in the middle of a pandemic and it didn’t register a notice or thank you from you. I can think of at least a 12th grade words for that.Edited: 3:41 am, July 30, 2020 "
