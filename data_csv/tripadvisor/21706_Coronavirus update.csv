First death from CV19 in Gambia reported today. RIP.
"geraintw37, RIP? this man crossed the border into TG and may have infected many people - he is a preacher so how many has be blessed with this virus.Edited: 6:07 am, March 23, 2020 "
Yet the mosques are still open.
"Couldn’t believe my local mosque this morning still calling out for prayer, they should be directed to call and instruct people to stay home 5 time’s a day if necessary!"
The person who died was a preacher of the Ahmadiyyasect who had returned to TG from Senegal. Wonder how many he infected?
"A lot of people are taking this virus seriously. Kairaba Ave,kotu and Kololi very quiet. Not the normal amount of traffic for the time of day"

"Now getting very close to home - case confirmed, Nurse at Brikama Hospital"
Get your head around these stats if you can!https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest
Where did you see the report about a nurse at Brikama? Can't see it mentioned in any official reports.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ET-lbsRXYAk2Anw…This only shows the 3 cases previously reported plus the suspected one of the companion to the preacher.
Face masks don't do much unless they're FFP3 spec and they fit the face properly. Much more effective is staying 2m apart and regular/thorough handwashing with hot water and soap. We're approaching 1000 deaths in the UK now and most people have started to take it seriously and behave properly.
"Something I heard on The World Service BBC: Where you widely see people in Hong Kong or elsewhere in Asia wearing face masks its because, there, people wear them to protect other people. In Europe and certainly in UK we think we wear them to protect ourselves. (No matter whether they are any use). A difference in the culture and attitude worth mulling over?Edited: 8:14 am, March 27, 2020 "
Many apologies for not getting back sooner. The ppst was based on a couple of reports later found to have come from a nurse at Brikama Hospital. This report was subsequently found to be totally incorrect and said nurse carpeted.Again my apologies as hate posting erroneous information
"Facemasks would be great here, may stop them spitting."
"True Easytime, I had to explain to someone yesterday not to spit because someone could walk on it and pick up the virus and bring it into the house. Nice bloke but...."
As far as I know there have no been confirmed reports of cases in my area.
"#26 Thara. Good news, but in Epsom, or a place in The Gambia? Its the Gambia travel forum!"

It was in many other countries and recognized as such by them before 11th MARCH.The link below describes the thinking behind the wording calling it a Pandemic.Epidemic Vs. Pandemic: What Exactly Is the Difference?The worldwide coronavirus outbreak has officially been declared a pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced March 11 during a media briefing.

China are large contributors to WHO which is why they ignored research from Taiwan which proved transmission from person to person and not only animal to person as the Chinese claimed initially. WHO are just as institutionally corrupt as the UN and world bank.
Perhaps you do not understand that the data and figures published by WHO are all provided by individual countries and only collated by WHO. They do not verify the information provided. China as a permanant member of the UN security council has a history of vetoing votes that are at odds with it's interests. They do the same at WHO which is why Taiwan is refused membership.
"BertYes, I do appreciate everything you said and I completely understand. I have been around the world a little, and at 77 years of age, have many life experiences and traveled the world since 1961. Even visiting zones where dangerous viruses are prevalent. What I was trying to say to you after your statement of:""I take the updates and figures from WHO with a pinch of salt.""Was, that it was not the WHO figures we see on the WHO site, but the figures submitted to the WHO or gleaned from the countries (194) to keep the world up to speed on the numbers. These figures are very often distorted by local recording, especially in China. Even the figures sent in by the UK are not seen by most as reliable, because of the testing or not of people who might or might not have the virus. China has a veto.....Don't I know it! But.....they are not in a position to VETO what the WHO send out as data or figures, because they have already signed up to it.So to recap. I was taking issue with your statement of ""I take the updates and figures from WHO with a pinch of salt."" when it was individual countries data collated by the WHO and posted for all to see.If you do take the information promulgated with a pinch of salt, please advised us where you can get better data that we might find more reliable.Edited: 6:00 am, April 01, 2020 "
WHO got the numbers badly wrong on Ebola and their modelling was way off the mark. So pinch of salt is what I take with all statistics and damn lies in this crisis.

Locally some people believe the 3 at MRC had been deliberately faking it and that the marabout had died of something else or he would have infected many people and such cases haven't surfaced. The country is incredibly fortunate so far if true.
Pleased to see the theories coming out of people who have heard from a friend of a friend of the cleaner who washed the car of the driver who took them to MRC.
"You yourself had to correct something you'd heard. Case confirmed, you wrote - nurse at Brikama hospital"" #17. It comes to us all!

Here is the reference to the companion of the preacher in the report dated 17th March.https://www.dropbox.com/s/mqjo5c3kk4n5j4d/null.pdf.pdf?dl=0It is from a reliable source!

"Many do not have Dropbox so cannot access the post. Some families in the Bundung area actually left as soon as this Preacher was confirmed with Covid 19.Still no more confirmed cases, we are living in the calm before the storm here."
"I don't think you need Dropbox. Just click and it opens the link to the Ministry of Health and WHO daily reportToday, once again, 22 tests all negative and no more new cases.. Crossing fingers we may be lucky - as we were with the Ebola."
"No it doesn't, you have to sign in."
The same information is available direct on the WHO site
"09-04-2020, still no new cases reported as of 0730"
"Easyltime your post #63How many tests have been carried out? Not trying to trip you up, it is just that if there is no testing being carried out, then reported cases are meaningless. Not just in TG, but worldwide."
"Frithwood, I can only go on what is posted here on Ministry site. They are only testing those who show up with symptoms. Lets face it, some could have already been buried who had the virus because so few checks are carried out here when someone dies."
"Post #65I agree with your post entirely. So along with many poor countries, the statement of no new reported cases holds true."
"I agree also; the dilemma however is that once this is all over, at what point will we in the UK trust The Gambia enough to return for our holidays?Unless we can develop a vaccine that is readily available from a Travel Clinic, then every holiday is a risk."
"As likely TG will require a certificate of immunity from each of us! Most of us if not all will have had Covid-19 by then and most should be fit enough to travel - if we're not completely broke and there aren't Exchange Controls in place, say £40 per person max!

"WHO are happy to accept only 3349 people have died in China, that casts serious doubt upon the accuracy of all their figures."
"Bert, there are no accurate figures.In England it's mainly people who are seriously ill in hospital who are being tested. The only way work out the correct figures would be to assume the 1% mortality rate is right and put a couple of zeros on the deaths and that would depend on whether the 1% mortality rate is actually correct.Easytime, what I thought might be happening was they had taken it down because the government of Gambia hadn't announced it yet and maybe requested it be taken down until the announcement.In England there were issues about informing relatives and everything before the stats are released."
"The good news, if what I've read is correct, is that they were all in quarantine, so I hope that was strict quarantine."
"Of course there are no accurate figures because it is a fast developing situation, but China are taking the urine. WHO havn't even questioned their numbers despite all the mounting evidence, they just keep taking the yuan."
If you read the report it implies that 2 are currently in quarantine and the other three WERE in quarantine. IE they had previously been quarantined but weren’t when they tested positive which is rather worrying.
"I don’t believe the Chinese figures either. Assuming Coronavirus “only” has a mortality rate similar to flu, in the UK it is estimated that around 5 - 10% of the population become infected and around 17000 people die as a result each year; that would mean worse case around 200000 people could die if 60% of the population ultimately caught the virus before herd immunity kicked in or a vaccine was available. We have a highly infectious, new virus, with no vaccine, that no one has immunity to unless they have already had the virus and China is suggesting only 3000 of its citizens died. Hmm.I’ve had the virus; it felt a lot worse than flu to me. The good news is that according to several studies, 50% of the people that get the virus don’t show any symptoms at all, so maybe, on average, the mortality rate will ultimately be lower than that of flu."
Please tell me where is the evidence showing that once you have had the virus you are immune and cannot get it again? I can find none.
"There are currently 3 known strains of coronavirus with the B strain being the most common in the UK at present; it is highly unlikely that once you have a particular strain that you would catch that strain again -- just like flu, but unfortunately, that probably doesn't prevent you catching one or both of the other 2 strains.I think coronavirus is here to stay, just like flu. Once a working vaccine has been developed then each year vulnerable people and people willing to pay will get a combined flu and coronavirus jab containing experts' best-guess as to which strains are likely to be the most prevalent during the next season. I really hope I'm wrong and instead the virus just fades away."

What is the latest news? Have the measures of closing the borders and stopping flights contained covid -19. It is some time since the preacher was reported to have died from it. If he had died from covid-19 I would have thought many people would be infected by now?
http://www.moh.gov.gm/covid-19-report/
Doing far better than us by the looks of it.
The reported cases in Senegal have doubled to over 600 in a day. Meanwhile the borders may be closed but not the sea routes. The fish factory at Sanyang has re opened and the beach is full of Senegalese fishing boats that have just returned.There is no social distancing bush taxis are still full to bursting and last Sunday the beach had hundreds partying. The attitude is the virus is not in gambia it will not come it is only in Europe. Allah will protect.When cv hits gambia as it surely will it will be devistating.

I do hope these recent posts won't be deleted on account of a technicality. It seems to happens on this forum.
"My friends say this morning they are aware of the danger (their words) and will take care re distancing, masks, washing as soon as they get back home. Thanks for your info again."
People are refusing to take the tests - fear and ignorance rule here. Even expats are saying that they will not go near the test centres because they cannot guarantee social distancing despite being told it will be rigorously maintained
Your assertion by the Upper River Region man that donations of supplies by President Barrow are election bribes must refer to the sensitively-named 'dignity kits' supplied to COVID-19 cases at the treatment center ...The Gambian government's genuine response to the emergency is impressive when one imagines a small country's administrative capacity would probably be limited.

Senegal due to be opening up from today including churches and mosques despite the fact that case numbers rise daily.Worrying development as Gambia will most likely follow their lead.

"Krd, they've got 21 deaths and 2105 cases which looks to me like they may be doing a good job of tracking and testing unlike the UK which has 32692 deaths and 226,463 cases, which is a joke because they haven't been testing. You can't compare the rate in Senegal to the rate in the UK because the UK number has always been so fake (and I don't know about the ones in Senegal)."
"A new case today.https:/…Click on the daily update tab.Edited: 9:59 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Jeffbrum - nearly everywhere is doing better than the UK - except America, Brazil and maybe Russia. In Africa the UV light and high temperatures might be helping to reduce transmission on hard surfaces. The very low average age (19) will help to keep mortality levels down compared to European countries.For me, Senegal continues to be of concern because the borders are so porous. Yesterday a marbout was intercepted sneaking in with his 17 disciples. Fortunately they were caught and quarantied immediately.Senegal now has 2,900 cases and 30 deaths so the numbers are continuing to rise."
"This thread has been quiet for some time now. Are things under control and no more infections being reported ?Edited: 3:06 am, June 04, 2020 "
No further cases reported by the Government. There seems to be a inordinate amount of Malaria deaths at the moment for the time of year.
There was one new case on 2nd June according to MRC daily report.
In Senegal and Guinea the cases have grown steadily over the past two weeks to just under 4000 in each country. Yet gambia has not had a single new case in the same time until one was added yeaterday. I find that interesting given that there has been no social distancing nor any change of habits here since the lockdown was first implimented.
Really? Where do you get that info from? Most people are reporting less deaths than usual

"From day one the Gambian MoH established an effective tracing and follow-up service. It appears to have been assiduous and, plus MRC expertise, has successfully kept the lid on cases mainly imports creeping in. I guess its a holding exercise (isn't it everywhere?) until hopefully a vaccine becomes available but the authorities in TG deserve thanks so far. Watch this site regularly for the interesting updates.http://www.moh.gov.gm/covid-19-report/A concerning matter was a difficulty re-integrating some recovered cases back into their families.

"I employ approx 405 people over 5 companies and have done so for over 25 years, my managers are reporting time off for funerals' has increased recently, and these are long term people who do not take advantage. I can only speak for my own experience."
I also employ people and have a clinic. Can't say we have had a big increase in deaths

"Black doctors consortium takes COVID-19 testing into their own handsAre you on the front lines of the coronavirus? Help us report on the pandemic.Pediatric surgeon Ala Stanford says as the number of coronavirus cases have risen in Philadelphia in the past several weeks, she has been getting more and more worried about the city’s Black residents.“In Philadelphia, African Americans represent 44 percent of the population, but at last check, 52 percent of the deaths,” she said. “For me, that was unacceptable.”Stanford grew up in North Philly, and now runs a medical consulting firm and has a private practice in Jenkintown. She is also on staff at Abington-Jefferson Health.She said as the weeks went by and more cases and deaths were recorded in the city, she began feeling increasingly frustrated."
2 more cases confirmed 15 June
"2 new cases today making 4 up to today.Edited: 3:21 pm, June 16, 2020 "
2 cases in people returning from Senegal. Other 2 are their families. Don’t even think of opening the borders! At least a closed border means fewer crossings.
"Senegal now over 5000 cases, agree border needs to be kept shut. Although Senegalese fishermen still landing at Sanyang fish factory. The borders are porous in this respect and the general population still oblivious to the threat of CV. It will not come to Gambia Barrow is only doing this to get money."
Hey! Does that need an edit? The final sentence - are you saying that's what the Gambians are saying to each other? And how does he make money?
"The Gambians say it is not in and will not come to gambia. They think it is all a ruse to get prevention money from WHO, and economic aid from World Bank/IMF.Edited: 10:11 am, June 17, 2020 "
Phased re opening of borders :https:/…
"Recommended by ECOWAS ministers, but to be confirmed by heads of state at a forthcoming summit, against a backdrop of WHO saying last week that the pandemic was accelerating on the continent."
"I prey Gambia doesn't open it's borders to soon. It has done so well so far by quickly acting and closing it's borders and the airport and in so doing kept covid-19 infections/deaths to a bear minimum. By contrast neibouring Senegal haven't done so well and if they re-open the borders then the cases in Gambia will rocket. For God's sake put lives before the economy.Edited: 11:47 am, June 21, 2020 "
"Agreed. For quick reference here is how total covid cases have progressed in Africa as a whole:100k in 4 months200K in next 18 days300K in next 13 days So you can see how much worse it is getting. At this rate we will soon hit 100,000 cases per week"
"The number of confirmed cases is on the rise, people still crossing borders with little hassle.Today a Brussels Air flight arrives bringing in Gambians and will be taking folks out. They have asked that people do not go to meet relatives or they ""could"" be put into quarantine accidentally.Some of the last confirmed cases came from Badala Park and that is the quarantine hotel."
"Another Gambian from the UK confirmed today with Coronavirus after being tested that was on the midweek flight.Edited: 6:40 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"A 2nd person on the flight with Brussels Airlines tested positive for covid19 today,why the heck are they bringing people in."
"I think the question is why aren’t people tested before being allowed to board the plane ? I don’t think, as good as it may sound, you can prevent people from returning home. Only Gambians or resident permit holders are permitted to fly in. Imagine if you were wanting to return home to your family and were prevented from doing so and had to remain in another country indefinitely.If the quarantine system works (big if) then any infected persons flying in should be isolated and tested on arrival and not allowed to circulate for 2 weeks and then only if negative.More worrying are the people crossing the land / sea borders from Senegal who mix with the population on arrival."
"Reference post #189>>>I think the question is why aren’t people tested before being allowed to board the plane ?<<<It is known that many infected people do not show any symptoms for between 2 and 7 days and in some cases up to 14 days. That is why 14-day isolation is advised to people who have been in contact with known infected people. Additionally many carry the virus and are asymptomatic. That is one of the reasons that anti-body tests ( reliable or not) are being introduced in the UK. So, testing everyone who boards a plane is not going to catch every case. That is why it is not being done. My daughter (lives 40 miles away) is Health & Safety and regularly visits hospitals around Worcester to train people in many aspects. In January she was quite ill with what her doctor and she thought was influenza. There is now a doubt as to whether it was Covid-19 or influenza. She has sent in a later type test. We await the test results."
"These infected people need to be identified before boarding. What about the other passengers and crew they may also have infected? I know the other passengers SHOULD be going into quarantine but from what I'm reading many don't, (I refer to those who should have gone to Badalla Park,) So they could be infecting the general population. Somebody needs to get a grip of the situation before it gets a hold there too."
"Reference #Post 191 Dave F said..>>>These infected people need to be identified before boarding.<<<If they are a. asymptomatic, or b.one of the people not showing symptoms when they are infected, then they cannot be identified. That is one of the reasons that the virus spreads so easily.Edited: 10:55 am, June 28, 2020 "
"And that is why everyone arriving should be put in 2-week's quarantine. But some - so Gambian - we've all seen the special treatment for friends at Arrivals - slide though at the side to avoid it. Fortunately they probably get picked up (the ID of everyone is known) but unfortunately not before they may have infected family at home. So selfish, so ignorant."
Reference #Post 193.>>>And that is why everyone arriving should be put in 2-week's quarantine.<<<Exactly. No doubt about it.
"Ref #192 ; I take your point but it doesnt alter the fact some of the people are slipping through the net and likely infecting others before the authority's catch up with them.Stricter controls need to be enforced at the airport with tough penalties for those who try to dodge the quarantine. I think most of us here if not all of us feel the same way and would hate to see all the good that has been done so far in containing the coronavirus be ruined by the few who think they are above the law.Edited: 5:30 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"Post #195 Dave FMy reply at #192 is factual and recognized in the UK. All people should be put in quarantine as soon as they land in the Gambia as stated by stephenghc in post #193It is up to the Gambian authorities to have officials meet every aircraft and enforce the 14 days quarantine.Edited: 7:31 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"Cases still rising, all imported. The last Brussels flight passengers were quarantined in Badala Park and several have now tested positive.Border also remains an issue as so easy to circumvent border posts."
Asymptomatic cases can still test positive with antigen test. Admittedly there is a window between being infected and testing positive but better to weed out as many as possible before flying.I have friends who need to travel to Japan in August. They have to show a recent negative test to board the plane and will then be tested at the airport in Tokyo on arrival and not allowed to leave until the results come back. A few hours.

When are the government going to make it mandatory to test everyone that dies for Covid 19. This will ensure that people will stay safe. A number of people are in denial of the virus.
Masks to be made mandatory next week. That’ll be interesting .....(As announced on TV by a government official wearing a mask around his chin)
Im reliably informed over 100 case reported today.

I read that as 100 new confirmed cases reported that day as well; although I should have known that couldn't be true because Gambia isn't doing enough testing to discover 100 new cases in a day. For every case they discover there are likely at least 10 times that number of cases they don't detect and count - just like the UK.
We are up to 20 cases a day now. Most worryingly about half of these from yesterday were just getting tested so that they could travel and not because they thought they had covid. It is out there in the community.

Live there is correct 7 wanting to fly to Senegal tested positive.10 cases of staff at Medicare clinic proved positive with 1 death so that's closed down no doubt for a clean so it's not good.

24 new cases today.
7 new cases as a result of a French businessmans party by the looks of it.
Stringent lockdown measures in kombo 1 and 2 being introduced probley tomorrow Friday according to the MOH.This will curb the spread of people heading out to the villages for Tabarski so stopping the spread of Coronavirus.

"And a flight from Brussels about to land in 45 minutes , plus tobaski soon too....."
"Pauline ,have you seen the report because I can't see it on the ministry of health site ?"
"Jeff - its in yesterday's report 23rd July - the newest.I also noticed - Three main waves of infection occurred – the pre airport closure wave, the importation from Senegal waveand the intermittent airport re-opening and loosening of restrictions wave.And - The search for confirmed cases who continue to be at large needs to be intensified in order to halt the potential spread of the virus by them. (These are the 6 of the confirmed cases at large – 1 was deported, 3 left the country surreptitiously prior to the release of their results and 2 absconded). Such a shame when so much has been achieved (despite NAWEC interruptions)."
"Thanks Stephen, the 23rd wasn't coming up when I was going on to the ministry of health site, although it did shortly after I posted."
And what's gone wrong at the laboratories ?
"Traveller, apparently there was trouble at the airport when those on the Brussels flight were told that they would have to pay for their own quarantine.As The Gambia knew this flight was coming they really should have informed them before boarding so they could decide whether to come or not."

3 cabinet ministers have now tested positive. Maybe its time someone actually got round to enforcing this ‘lockdown’.Kids are running around all over the place. Clubs are open and throwing parties.There is not (and never has been) any social distancing or acknowledgement of the existence of this virus amongst the general population.The government is all hot air. They announce rules but do nothing to enforce and do not follow them themselves.State funeral. Political rallies. Nonsense.Now we are in big trouble.
"Today's news, might help in places to avoidhttps:/…"
173 new cases reported today. It is rumoured that there are over one thousand samples still waiting to be tested so this figure is somewhat behind the current reality.
Too little.....too lateWill it be enforced.....or just another back pocket revenue stream?
The govt needs to enforce a lockdown however this in turn will lead to accusations of brutality and then public unrest. They are very likely to over react in the actual implementation of the restrictions. It’s a mess either way!
Time for the military on the streets or buy more body bags.
The government issues rules(face masks etc) but are they following their own rules.Unlikely with the number of ministers and officials testing positive.How can you enforce the rules on the general population when obviously you are not yourselves.
Their will be a curfew starting immediately from 10 am until 5 pm.
"Have you been on the pop Angler, shouldn't the hours be from 10pm until 5am as from tomorrow Thursday."
"A 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew will go into effect on Thursday, public gatherings will be banned and markets will have to close by 2 p.m., government spokesman Ebrima Sankareh told the national broadcaster."
"SOE again with addition of night time curfew. Places of worship closed again (too late). Only food outlets, pharmacies etc allowed to open. Year 12’s still attending schools for exams but no one else. University and other places of higher learning closed. Borders remain closed, returning residents on Brussels Airlines told to provide negative CV test no older than 72 hours before departure."
"D5,000 fine for breaking curfew. Army authorised to be on streets to enforce."

Ministry of Health updateshttps://www.facebook.com/MohCovid19GMB/Ministry of Tourism update.https:/…
"The tourism document makes it pretty clear there will be no tourists coming to Gambia in the 20/21 season. Do they really think people coming for a two week winter sun holiday will be happy to spend the entire 14 days in a room at the designated govt run quarantine facility. With no choice meals served to the room, no opportunity to go outside unless with a health official, and their luggage held for 72 hours for screening."
"Jon ,the document looks legitimate to me but do you know where it came from ?"
3 deaths ?.....I know of one confirmed covid death since the previous Ministry of Health report and I'm not in contact with many people in Gambia.
still trying to find out of the provenance of the document. Too many photostatted pages in the one doing the rounds.FACT That it appears on another Facebook site does not mean it is genuine.
"The only reference I can find to the document is via that MyGambia link. I cannot find any other source, not even on the MOTC web pages."
"Yes Trev, I looked on that myGambia website and it looks as if it's in the form of a letter but if it's genuine, I think it should be in the form of an official document on the ministry of tourism website."
Agreed - I checked a few of the online newspapers too and couldn't find any mention of it.
"i am now having doubts regarding the authenticity of this document. Initially I had no reason to assume it was anything other than official and genuine.Because Jon has a reputation of integrity, intelligence, and insight over many years providing invaluable contributions to this forum. Whereas The Gambia Tourist Authority has a history of corruption, incompetence, ignorance and a total lack of vision. So if it turns out to be fake news don't blame me."
"With all due respect to Jon and Bert I thought I was the first to point out it may be doubtful....With everybody and their dogs posting rubbish on Facebook I have a tendency to check where it came from and in most cases its a case of he said, she said and they think....."
You were indeed first to point it out but I don't understand why you need to point it out that you were first to point it out.
"I questioned this document on a Facebook site as it has not been published on the official GTB page or the Ministry of Health page either, no one seems to know who manages the site ( My-Gambia.com) that Jon put up, it is the only site I have seen it on, then it has been requoted all over the place. To me it looks like a draft document too.Edited: 1:29 pm, August 23, 2020 "
