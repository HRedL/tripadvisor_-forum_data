"I will be travelling to Joinville du Pont in August to visit my grandfather's grave. I did the journey in 2011 by travelling on the RER A train from Gare de Lyon to Joinville du Pont, but this year part of the line will be closed. I thought I could go from Vincennes instead but don't know how to get there. Any ideas for the best way to get to Joinville from central Paris by using the metro to link up with a station which goes to Joinville?"
https://www.vianavigo.com/en/RER A is closed between Nation and La Defense stops until Aug. 26.Get to Nation stop (depending where in Paris you're coming from; from Gare de Lyon 2 stops on Metro 1.Access RER A (NEGE) at Nation stop in direction of Gare de Boissy St Leger and get off at Gare de Joinville du Pont.
"As noted, you can still get there via RER A from Nation. How to get to Nation will depend on where you start from. We live two stops down and it is no problem getting into Paris and back.Edit: it is Joinville-LE-Pont, BTW ;)Edited: 2 years ago "
Thank you so much for your reply. I wasn't sure Nation would be open. Also name correction noted.
Thank you so much for your help. I wasn't sure if Nation would be open. I can get there on the metro. The trip is very important because we are going to visit the grave of my grandfather who died 100 years ago at the end of WW1. So thanks again for your prompt response
"While I know Joinville very well and often take walks there from my home, your question made me realize I had no idea where the cemetery is so I looked it up and if you remember from your previous trip, it is not close to the RER station and you will need to take a bus.Do you know all the practical details such as bus number, cemetery opening hours, where in the cemetery your grandfather's grave is, etc? If you need any help, let me know (and give me your travel date) as I live really close.Also, Joinville is lovely and well worth visiting (the river Marne, the marina, the canal de Polangis, the Île Fanac island, the guinguettes, the beautiful 19th century architecture...) especially on a hot summer day."
"Thank you Mrs_French_mystique for your interest. We will be visiting on Sunday 12th, We are doing a 5 day excursion to Paris and Sunday is a free day so we are going to Joinville-le-Pont then. I admit I don't know the times the cemetery opens and really hope it does open on a Sunday. If you have that info I would appreciate it. We walked from the station last time and will be happy to do the same this time. We did stop at the river on the way back to sample one of the delicious cakes from the cake shop (which will obviously be closed this time). I found out about my grandfather when I researched my family tree. I had no idea he was buried in Joinville and for a while, I had no idea why. You will find there are 14 Commonwealth War Graves in the cemetery, and they are all soldiers from various countries who died at the Canadian Mobile Hospital which was stationed at Joinville for some time in WW1. My grandfather is one of them. He died when he was on his way home. of the influenza epidemic which killed so many people, at that time."
"Wow, what a story.Unfortunately, the cemetery is closed on weekends. :( It is only open Monday-Friday from 8:30 AM to 5 PM. I can inquire about the possibility for someone to let you in at some specific time if there is no other day possible for you. If Sunday is your only possibility, any idea what time you would be coming or are you flexible that day in case they agree to have someone meet you there but at a time that works for them?I can't promise anything as in August a lot of people are away on holiday but I will send them a message. I have a contact there but I hope he is not away, otherwise, I will call the municipal services tomorrow or Friday."
"Oh dear, it never occurred to me that the cemetery would be closed at the weekend. There is one other day we could go. Friday afternoon. We just thought it would be better to have all day. It is really kind of you to try to get the cemetery opened especially for us, but because of the transport difficulties already defined, we couldn't really know when we would get there, so I wouldn't ask you to do that. I will discuss it with my family (there are 6 of us going, 4 grandchildren and partners), but I think we will opt for changing the day (and having a cake!). When we have visited we will be leaving a wreath and short biography of my grandfather for any locals who are interested to read. Thank you again for your help. Regards Barbara"
"I e-mailed the person I sort of know but got an automatic reply saying he was away until August 20.I was aware of the Canadian hospital as I had seen old WW2 photos and also, the bus stop for my former workplace in the adjacent town of Saint-Maurice, near RER Joinville-le-Pont, was called Les Canadiens, because a street and district are named after it. ;) But it is nice to finally hear from someone who has an actual connection to its history.The military hospital itself was in the Bois de Vincennes on the Plateau de Gravelle which was part of Joinville-le-Pont at the time, before it was annexed by the city of Paris in 1929. It was located south east of the hippodrome, between the Lac de Gravelle (the smallest of the four lakes of the Bois de Vincennes) and the Joinville-le-Pont RER station: https://www.google.fr/maps/@48.8203044,2.4562808,16z?authuser=0&authuser=0&hl=frThe buildings were on the slope just south of Route de la Ferme. Now there is the Paris arboretum (which I love) on the eastern portion of where they stood and a police academy to the south. So that is where your grandfather was treated and died (although the presence of the hospital saved most of the local population from the great influenza epidemic).I will definitely go and read your grandfather's biography and share photos of it if you allow me to."
"Typo: I had seen WW1 photos, of course ;)"
"The exact location of the hospital and the rest of the information you have supplied is news to me and very welcome. I will add it to my grandfather's biography. I'm very happy for you to share the information with anyone who might be interested. When we first visited in 2012 I found it quite emotional to think that no-one in the family knew our grandfather was buried in Joinville, and that his wife would never have had the opportunity to visit his grave. I will think of you and your help when we visit Joinville. Once again thank you. Regards Barbara"
There are 4 different metro lines that go to Nation; 2 and 6 terminate there and 1 and 9 also pass through there so presumably one of those metros will be near where you are staying and will take you to the RER A and your destination. How sad to make it though the war and die in the epidemic. My grandmother died in that same epidemic when my father was 2 years old. It is a largely forgotten disaster that affected a lot of lives.
There are so many sad stories from both world wars and others. Thank you for that additional information about the metro links.
"Hello, Barbara.Good news! I contacted the town hall and the cemetery is in fact open on Sundays from 8 to 6 in August (the website info is dated) but there will be no one on site to help you on Sundays, that's all. Since you have already been and the place does not seem to be huge, it shouldn't be a problem for you to locate the grave.I will try to go this Sunday just to double check. ;)"
"Mrs FM what a hero you are, going to all that trouble. I have been chatting to my family all morning and we worked out that by giving up one of the excursions, we can devote the whole day on Friday to going to Joinville, which is after all the reason for the trip in the first place, and now that I've just told them that we could have gone on Sunday after all, we have decided we would now prefer to do the trip to the cemetery on the first day of our stay rather than on the final day. Also being a week day, shops etc are more likely to be open, so thank you for that information but we will stick to the new plan. I hope you know how much your help has made planning our trip much easier. Regards Barbara"
"You're welcome, Barbara, my pleasure. And I had never looked into where the hospital was exactly until your question so since I often walk in the Bois de Vincennes, I will look at the particular place with a different perspective so thank YOU also. :)Excellent that you have some flexibility. Either day would be fine so whatever works best for you. In August a lot of shops are closed and on Sunday, all the water/beach activities as well as the guinguette Chez Gégène make the place lively so it would have been a good day too. I am curious about the cake place now, no idea which one it is. ;)"
"Mission accomplished!. We found our way via the metro and RER A train to Joinville-le-Pont with no problems. In the end we went on Saturday and found the cemetery open. We visited our grandfather's grave and left a wreath and a short biography. Being Saturday it was market day, so a bit busier and livelier than on the previous occasion. The patisserie shop (Estaelle) was still there so we treated ourselves to some more delicious cakes and took them to the riverbank to eat. After that we stopped for a drink in one of the cafes before returning the same way to Paris. A lovely day and a lovely visit to the beautiful city of Paris. Thank you once again for all the advice especially from Mrs_French_Mystique. xx"
"Excellent!I will definitely try to go to the cemetery soon.<<The patisserie shop (Estaelle) was still there so we treated ourselves to some more delicious cakes and took them to the riverbank to eat.>>Wow, I didn't know it was Estaëlle! Estaëlle is the business name of Raphaëlle Estival who is from my town and opened her first boulangerie just down my street in the late 1980's/early 1990's when we were young. It was so popular that people from all over town and neighboring towns would get off the RER station Le Parc de Saint-Maur just to get her bread after work even if they had to take the RER again to go back home and there was always a long line outside the bakery even though there was another excellent boulangerie next door as well as dozens of decent to good ones nearby.And then, she got so popular that she ended up opening other locations in other parts of town and other towns and became Estaëlle. And then, inexplicably, one day, she closed the original one in Saint-Maur! It was replaced by some stupid chain called Saines Saveur, grrrr.Then a few years ago, the other excellent baker retired and the new one is not good at all! Thankfully, the third boulangerie that is in my neighborhood was bought by a new baker, Frédéric Favreau, one of the best bakers in France he and his lovely Japanese wife are so sweet. Anyway, now you know all about the bread drama in my neighborhood, lol! I didn't even know she had a shop in that part of Joinville. Raphaëlle is a local girl of my generation and a local legend, one of my clients and I were talking about her the other day, catching up on local gossip. :)"
I didn't realise we had accidentally found something so prestigious. We just knew they were delicious!!!
