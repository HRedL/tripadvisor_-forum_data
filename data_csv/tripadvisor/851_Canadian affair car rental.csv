Do to the Covid 19 i had cancelled my trip to Alberta. I got a voucher for my west jet flight minus 103 euro and Canadian Affair for my car rental have been slow to respond. If i cancel with them now i only getting 50% back. Not sure what to do to get all the money back . If i wait until the 16th June the time i wanted the car and hope i get the whole refund or to take my loss? But if i dont get all my money back then i am not sure if i can afford to go next year . Has any of you had any dealing with Canadian Affairs?
"I would think that since there are no international flights, they should have to refund you 100%.Are you looking at their usual cancellation policy or have you contacted them specifically about cancelling during Covid?"
"Did you read this page? https:/…coronavirusAlthough it’s 10 day’s since the last update, I would imagine the same procedures are in place. They are asking that you not call but they will be in touch presumably after they have finished with May bookings."
"Don't cancel, you will lose some money.Many booking agents have enough staff to handle their regular numbers of cancellations, but are overwhelmed with the number of cancellations that go with a pandemic. They then get backlogged with their refunds due.Unfortunately, I think you lost Euros with WestJet by not waiting for them to cancel.You did not want to cancel, they are unable to fly you here because of Covid so they have to cancel.If you ever think of booking an accommodation or vacation rental through Trip Advisor (I sincerely hope you won't, book directly instead), it is the same thing. If the owner tells you they cannot accommodate your stay and you should cancel, don't. Tell them they have to cancel. That way they have to bear the burden not you."
"It all started when my first B&b who i stayed with last year wrote to me that they will not opening this year after all because of the virus. Then i went into panic not knowing if i would travel and where to stay before driving to my next place in Yoho. Then i decided it will be best to cancel all.No problem with the b&bs at all just west jet and with my short flight with aer lingus i wont get no money. Canadian affair did write back after many emailsThank you for your e-mail and I am sorry that you have not had a response to your enquiry. As your reservation is for June we are currently unaware if it will be affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as the guidance on non-essential travel may change closer to the rental date. At the moment should you wish to cancel it would be as per the terms and conditions, see car hire cancellation details below and you would be required to contact your Travel Insurance Provider to query a claim for the loss. Car Hire Cancellation 84 days (12 weeks) or more prior to rental loss of deposit83 – 31 days prior to rental 50% loss30 – 16 days prior to rental 80% loss15 days or less prior to rental 100% loss As you are within 83 – 31 days the loss would be £177.86 and the remaining amount will be refunded. Please confirm if you would like to proceed to cancel. So will i just wait it out?"
"You can wait as though you expect tourist travel to reopen in June. If Canada extends the ban on travel for tourism into June, they will have to cancel and refund you the money.If you don't plan to come at all, then get the best %age of refund Can Affair offer while you can.June 16th is about 6 weeks away. Not too many of us think that the travel ban of tourist travel will be lifted by then. But nobody knows."
"Yes, wait. Should have done that with the Airline, EC261 would have triggered a right to a full refund for transatlantic travel if they had to cancel flights from EU (getting it at present can be another thing however!).If you don't get it all back (hopefully you will if travel is still restricted) claim on your travel insurance for the balance.Edited: 5:40 am, April 24, 2020 "
"I agree with the suggestions regarding the airline, and that it would have been better to wait than cancel.I'm less certain on the rental car. I could totally see a situation where domestic travel is permitted but the border remains closed. I'm not sure what would happen then. The car rental company may say that they are open and renting vehicles to customers. The fact that you're not able to enter the country might not be something they take responsibility for.I'm not saying it will turn out that way, and I've never actually prepaid for a car rental reservation before, but it's not as simple as the airline example, where the airline is likely to cancel the flight, making you entitled to a refund. Your rental agency may well still be offering cars at that time, and enforce the standard terms.That's a tough call."
"Hi DCH.That’s when my travel insurance would step up, but I suppose it depends how good your policy is, and what excess/deductible it has, but closed borders ( in my case the FCO advice) is a slam dunk."
"DCH - she rented a car from a Travel company that only supplies packages to those living outside of Canada. If international travel is not allowed, they should be refunding..Cubanjunky, agree with others you need to wait."
Guess i have to just wait and see. My travel insurance wont pay a penny for anything Covid-19 related. Thanks everyone and stay safe.
