My father's visa was issued with the wrong date of birth. It says 4 of May but the correct is 5 of april. It is an eVisa. Do I need to get it corrected?
"Hi,Contact the Dept of Immigration and Border Security for the definitive answer.https://www.border.gov.au/Cheers,"
"In Australia we write the date as ... day/month/year ... which is 5/4/####, are you sure it's incorrect or did whoever fill it out use the US standard?"
Yes of course it needs to be correct.
"Does it say 4th May or does it say 4/5 (which is 4th May) or does it say 5/4 (5th April).Did you enter the information correctly on the application?Yes, it needs to match his passport.Edited: 3 years ago "
Applying for another may not work as all the details will be the same except date of birth (including email address) so an alert may be raised.... I'd contact them and explain.
Thank you. The month is definitely wrong. Hope it can be fuxed without major dramas. I will sort it out when I am back to Syd...on holidays in Japan at the moment.
"This sort of thing with dates can be a confusing and irritating business with many American sites using their back to front method. I've even had situations where the date I type in has been automatically changed, for example 11/10/xxxx. Perhaps this is what's happened."
"My father is Brazilian and 75. It was a genuine mistake, do u know the process to get it fixed?"
There must be a phone number somewhere for this sort of thing. Why not go back to the website and look at FAQs and their number?
"I spoke to an Australian visa office a few years ago, when my tourist visa was declined (I wasn't eligible as I have dual nationality though and therefore had to have an Australian passport). So unless it's changed recently, you could speak to a real person."
I can easily call the immigratiin from Australia and I will do it first thing when I am back home. I will post the outcome next week. My old man is so looking foward to spend time with his grandaughter and hopefully this can be easily amended. Thank u so much for the info.Edited: 3 years ago 
"If you / your father applied for the visa online and you can access the online account then you should login and you can see that you can update the Department about a change in details via the online account. If you cannot do that, you must contact the Department for help. I am not sure where you are based but the easiest thing to do is to call the Europe service centre, as you will get to speak to an actual person. Here are the details:uk.embassy.gov.au/lhlh/IMMI_contact.htmlThey will be able to help.All the best!VeronikaMARN: 0301155"
Hi! Very desperate here. Had more or less same problem. Got my tourist visa with bdate 25th instead of 24th. How did you rectify it? Did you fill up correction form? Where did u send it?
"Filipino. From the Philippines. When I noticed the error i immediately filled up the notice of error in the immiaccount update us option. I filled out 3 boxes stating the the error, correct date, reason. When i got the visa few days later the mistake was not rectified. Now my problem is where to raise my concern. The aus emba here in manila 7578100 is to no avail. I emailed them and got autogenerated reply that if my concerns are not covered by FAQs they will reply in 2weeks. Anyone here to help me out?"
"Thanks for the response. Just got an email from them. They told me No need to apply new visa since its the same infos and datas. So anyone out here with more or less same scenario, email would help. Just dont ask me how many times though ahahahaEdited: 3 years ago "
"hi there, we contacted the Americas office by email and I also followed up with a phone call. Becausehe is Brazilian the visa was issue by the Americas office. They amended the date in the system but did not issue a new visa. I had an email from them saying they had corrected it and with a phone number to call if there were issues. there was no problems boarding but the immigration in Australia pulled my father away while they checked the dates."
"I also completed the form and submitted more documentation. As mentined previously, they did not issue a new visa but amended in their records. Suggest you check where the visas from Phillipines are issued. If you don't get a reply suggest u carry copy if your emails. As far as I remember the birth date can nit be corrected in the immaccount."
So when your father was pulled out what papers did they ask from your dad? Did it take long? I got the email as well but since they wont issue new visa im expecting to be pulled out as well.
it didn't take longer and they just double checked the notes in the system and didn't ask for any paper work. He had all the email trail just in case it was asked. I think you will be fine.
To what emailadress did you correspond with the australian embassy?
"I filled the Visa online. I am from the Netherlands, that's why I looked up contact information from the closed Australian embassy which is located in Germany. But all the contact information states that it does not include questions about visas. I requested my visa 8th of july and found out my birth date was also incorrect. Like you said the wrong birth date will most likely not be a problem I hope. But just to be safe I want to contact the embassy."
I got an Visitor Visa 600 from the Australian border site and had to pay 140 AUD... I don't think the visas are for free. I am gonna travel through Australia for 6 months and had to pay for the Visa.
"hmm, I should have asked for advice sooner... I already paid for the visitor visa. That's why I'm hoping the wrong birth date is not going to be a problem because it cost me quite some money. I filled in the enquiry, I think all I can do now is wait for a reply. Thanks for your advice!"
"I applied for Australian Eta and my application came back with 4th April instead of 5th, I have E_mailed them twice now and have had no response back, I am from UK , can anyone help me"
"How did you get an ETA with a UK passport? Should be a free eVisitor Visa subclass 651. Did you go through a travel agent or third party for it, rather than apply direct online?When are you Travelling? You may be just as quicK/easy to apply for a new eVisitor Visa with the correct details. It would automatically cancel out the previous one."
"I am not travelling until beginning of next year, so plenty of time, and I only applied last week for it"
"HI, & yes it was a E-visitor I applied for free, I still have heard nothing back from there Help desk at all about the wrong date given, have you any ideas what I can do I am from the UK"
We've already told you what to do.Just apply for another one
"Hi, could you please let me know the email address of americas office? I have a similar problem with my father's visa and the email address immigration.americas@dfat.gov.au is not giving any response.Sabal"
"Yeah I did, the lady on the other end gave me that email address and told me the issue will be solved within 3 days. Its the 5th day today and I haven't got response from them. Just wanted to know if I am emailing the right address.Thanks"
"Thanks Luigi,I have tried everything possible within this week. I also contacted immigration office here in Australia they refer the matter to Washington DC where the documents were processed and visa was granted and say from here they cant do anything. Embassy in United States have no official email address. Contacting America Office by phone is not easy because of the time difference and lenthy waiting period.The visa was granted without any further documents required so we don't have any email address of processing officer as well. If only the originator of this post could reply me with the email address she had correspondence with will help as a last resort as i have tried every other alternative. My father contacted the Airlines and got replied that if his visa cannot be verified by vevo he will not be allowed to board the plane as well. To view visa in vevo date of birth is must. When we check the visa doesnt show in right DOB instead in the wrong one.. frustrating."
He has passport of Nepal and permanent resident of United States.
"I seriously thought i must write here even though its old enquiry. I am sure lot of us might visit this page. When we are in such helpless situation. I travelled to Singapore from India with my year of birth being wrong. I noticed it as soon as we got visa. My friend in singapore tried applying it in singapore with the correction but in vain. He wasnt following some norms. Since i had the proof that i had applied three times, i thought immigrarion people might understand its a human error and permit me to enter their country. To my surprise they deported me back to india. I urge you all those facing problem do not travell. Talk to immigration people or write to them guidance. But be sure to correct it or else you may have wait in closed doors. I was lucky to get return ticket in few hours but some stay their for more two days or even more. Cannt use phone or any our articles. They will be locked in lockers. It was painfull experience. Please please dont travel and dont take such a risk."
"HI AC, I have the same exact problem with my wife's visa in Philippines. I have sent email but it's taking longer than it took to get the visa. They say there is nothing they can do, you just have to wait and check online."
Im banging my head now of worry.. pls do help me how u got the birth date corrected.. it would be a big relief to know it is still possible to change it. My gratitude!
Hi! Any update on the correction of birthdate of ur wife’s visa?
Hi! Were u able to correct the birthdate of ur father? Im having the same trouble now.
I'm US citizen and I applied and got ETA for AUS. But my birthdate I accidentally entered incorrect. month and day. Where can I send email to correct this?
"Are you sure it’s wrong? Australia doesn’t put month then day, like you do in the US. 5th March tomthem (and most of the rest of the world) is 5/3 not 3/5.If it really is wrong, I believe there is a notice of amend e t you can complete. Should be on their site somewhere. Either that or pay another AUD20and apply for a new one with the correct information."
"I had same problem and re-applied for new visitor visa, I was re-issued with correct information"
"Yes, it is incorrect. Because I put the same for day as my birthday month. So, now I try to check my ETA and enter incorrect birth date it comes up. I wasn't sure if I apply multiple times it will cause any issue or not. I don't mind paying $20 just don't want it to get more screwed. I tried filling form online but no idea when they will look,"
How long before you are due to Travel?
Read post 26 from our TA visa 'expert' - the visa is linked to your passport and the passport is the most important document (not your application). The system knows your correct birth date from the passport number.
I'll be travelling in 3 days.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Yes, you are right. Called Qantas and they can see my ETA with my passport number. Thank you so much!"
Did u get ur dates corrected already?

Hi. Can I know what you did here? I'm from the PH too and having the same problem. I need help. Lodged my application and sent a notification of incorrect answer. What do I need to do? Did you manage to change it?
"My Australian visa not visitor visa, I have my Permanent resident visa,my Question is how to fix my year of my born was wrong, in my visa was born 1956,real my born was 1955.Could you please let me know what should I do?

"Hi My mother""s Australia visa granted but year of birthday is wrong our nationality is Iranian . could you help me how can send request to have modified visa with correct year of birthday.Thank you"
"Hi, I have the same problem as yours. Was the visa ammended?"
I did but there are no clear answers. I'm from Philippines by the way. Can I travel even if the birth date is wrong?
"Hi Luigi,I read your comments re about people makes mistakes on their online evisitor (651). I also applied for this visa for my father and accidently wrote down an incorrect birth year (the issued date of the passport instead of his stated birthyear. But based on these details, I have a granted visa.I called the European call centre as I couldn't adjust the birth year on their online system. (online immi gov au) I had to fill out a form 929 with a copy of the passport. The lady told me that that department could amend it for me. To my surpriseI received their reply, which was forwarded to me somehow, with the request to send them the original birth certificate and a translated script of it. As we are both abroad, we can't provide it. Instead I send them his ID certificate with his birthyear and with his finger prints even on it.As you can imagine that I'm very stressed out as he would travel in 4 days.I quote your previous comment: ""It is not an insurmountable problem. A visa is tied to a passport number anyway, so date of birth is of secondary importance."" --> how do you know that for sure?Callcentre adviced me to do the form 929 instead of withdrawal my granted application. I suggested just to apply for a new evisitor and she wouldn't recommend it neither. Could you please shine your light on my case? Thanks Luigi."

Hi apple I’m reading your post we have same problem. How you resilved that problem? Thank u
Read the entire thread - the visa is attached electronically to your passport which has the correct dates.
Hi. I got my bday in my visa incorrect. And I am leaving for australia tomorrow from philippines. I just noticed yesterday while im preparing my stuff that mu bday is incorrect. Any suggestions how can I fix this?
Hi. Did you travel eventhough the birthdate is incorrect?
"Anyone travel with wrong date of birth on visa grant, any issues please let me knowthanks"
"I have the same question, I made a mistake on my birth date of 5 days, we leave in 2 weeks.Thanks Olga"
"Thank you Luigi for your answer.I looked through the whole thread and there is some conflicting information.What I did - I filled out forms 929, but the response time is 60 days.We also called the helpline https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/, but we didn't receive any specific information.We have 2 weeks to go and we are running out of time when we can still pay for renting the motorhome.We're flying to Perth.Our passports - Poland -EU"
"Before you rent a motorhome you should research their feasibility on the Western Australia forums. They’re not a cheaper alternative and often much more expensive than a car and modest accommodation. You can’t just stop anywhere, you have to stay in (and pay for) approved sites."
"Hi so to update, I am already in Australia. Its true that you wont have any problems with Aus immigration but when I was checking out in the Philippines, the wrong dob had given me so much headache. I was thankful that before the flight I went to the Aus embassy in Manila to fix the problem. But unfortunately the receptionist didn't let me go to the office. Instead they gave me an email address which they said that I should contact them through that email address to address my problems. And when they respond, they said that the changes will take affect after 24 to 48 hrs. But the problem was that my flight would be 20 hrs later. So just to be sure i keep the emails so that if the immigration or the airline didn't let me to board I have atleast proofs that my dob has been changed.It took time before the airline let me board the plane because of the wrong dob, its such a pain but its doable. I think that this will work if you process your visa yourselves without agency. If you use an agency to process your visa, its best if you contact them so that the problem will be fix.Hope this will help."
