"JB,I hope that he’s not planning a big festival, to celebrate the end of COVID-19.Back in 1918, that did not work out so well: https:/…flu-epidemic-hits-philadelphiaHunt"
"Hey Hunt, de Blasio has already suggested a parade to thank all of the first responders in New York. You could go to that one. You know what a big supporter he has always been of the NYPD and NYFD !"
Awaiting the plan.(4 pm)
The state-wide stay at home order is extended to May 15 which aligns with the timing our Mayor ordered for Orleans Parish.
Here's a link to a City Business article outlining the current state of restrictions in New Orleans. https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2020/04/28/city-changes-to-state-order-dont-apply-to-new-orleans-restaurants-stores/?utm_term=City%3A%20Ease%20on%20restrictions%20won%27t%20apply%20to%20New%20Orleans%20restaurants%2C%20stores&utm_campaign=City%3A%20Ease%20on%20restrictions%20won%27t%20apply%20to%20New%20Orleans%20restaurants%2C%20stores&utm_content=email&utm_source=Act-On+Software&utm_medium=email
Boy they picked a really inappropriate picture of bourbon street for the app home page! It hasn’t been that hazy in the Quarter for a LONG time!
What app?
On my phone .... the Trip Advisor New Orleans picture is a very crowded and hazy Bourbon Street..(?)
I see it now-it is a weird picture.

"Currently, all restaurants are still required to just do take out, curbside pickup or delivery. Currently, NOLA can not open up outdoor seating areas for people to eat their take out. Malls cannot do curbside delivery. Jefferson parish, (metairie), however, can do outdoor dining of take out - no table service. Stores can do curbside delivery. Naturally, I want to open my restauant again for table service, but it's more important that my staff feels safe in doing so."
"""Currently, all restaurants are still required to just do take out, curbside pickup or delivery""Is this until the middle of month or even the end of month?"
Right now it is until May 16 in Orleans Parish. It could be extended.
Good it is extended. I'd say plan for June 1st at the earliest.
