Does anyone know the chances of this virus clearing up by the the end of march?
"Well, considering that 72% of all statistics are made up on the spot I'd say you have a 2.718% chance that the virus will be cleared up by the end of march.Realistically, without exceptional cleaning efforts, the virus will persist for some time. I would also expect the virus to remain generally contained. I would do what is prudent and avoid resorts which have been confirmed to be a ""hot zone"" (Ie. RIU).Think of it as the flu during flu season - just maintain good hygiene, be vigilant about the foods you eat (when in doubt, if you didn't boil or peel it, dont eat it) and you should be perfectly fine!It is perfectly normal to be concerned with these issues (malaria and noroviruses) but you can't let them ruin your holidays! Recall that we have West Nile and Norwalk virus up where we live too ;-)"
"I Live in NY, and have been threw many of flu seasons. I think people are making more out of it than it actually is. I was just hoping for a vacation with no worries. As far as malaria goes, you are right... The west nile can be just as deadly and I take the risk of getting it every summer."
"If you feel more is being made of the virus than that which really exists, than just go. Why ask the question if your going to answer it yourself?"
"To:lavoiedI live in New York too, and I actually was there, I found Riu complex where apparently the whole thing started completelyunsanitary, shortage of staff. When you walk thru the resortthe smell of sewer is overhelming. And 1 year go things wheremuch different. Everything was fine. I visited D.R. many timesand never got ill, until now. There something wrong the way thehotel is run. At the end I will not visit D.R. ever again, andwhoever has excuses that this is a third world country betterget alive, most of the Caribean is poor, and they do not expierence problems on this scale.This country has a long way to go to at least meat minimum standard so people will visitthem. Or at least the Riu complex. They people of D.R. are the most friendly and hard working and they deserve better."
"lavoied it sounds alot worst then it really is.... My hubby, 12 yearold daughter and I just returned from Puerto Plata on Sunday Feb 6th. We stayed at the Puerto Plata Village in the Playa Dorada area, NONE of us got sick or came down with anything.We ate, drank, used ice cubes, and swam in the hotel pool. We did use hand sanitizer very frequently. On arrive to the resort we were advise from our tour Rep. that purified water is used to make ice cubes as well that it is used to wash and prepare all fruit and vegtables.I walked the beach daily spoke to many people from all sorts of resorts and no one that I spoke to heard or came down with any illness.They all said the same thing that it started at the RIU resorts only it has travelled to the Breezes resort because the Riu resort started to transfer their guests to the Breezes resort because they were forced to shut down at the Riu and sterilize the whole resort. A few illnessess were reprted at the Breezes resort.All is well in Puerto Plata relax and have a great vacation,we had a great time.Enjoy!!!!! "
"Thanks to all.... I am staying at the Grand Flaminco, and hopefully everything is ok there. The way people talk on this site make you believe is that there is a epidemic going on. "
"to:lavoiedWhen i was in Riu Bachata in beginning of Dec 2004, there was definetly an epidemic, you are going to a different hotel and most likely you will be o.k."
