"There is no need to panic.But, It's always good to take protection. You may bring the specific mask i.e. N95 Respirators"
Thanks for quick response
"Several cases of Swine Flu infection has been reported at many places in India. But we are a billion + people so there is no epidemic and people are leading normal daily life.....But as I said earlier, no harm in taking extra precaution."
