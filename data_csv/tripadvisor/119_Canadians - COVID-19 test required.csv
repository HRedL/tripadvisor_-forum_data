"Hello. The requirement to present a negatve COVID-19 test within 72 hours is virtually impossible to guarantee for anyone in Ontario. The average turn around time is between 2 and 8 days, no guarantee. It's the luck of the draw.So, I guess this means that Canadians cannot travel to Curacao, or any other island where this is a requirement.Just a comment, not a question."
I live in NB - you have to have at least one symptom to get tested - so not a reality for us.
"The reality for all Canadians, is that the problem with the COVID testing within 72 hours, along with the 2 week quarantine upon return, and no insurance being valid, we cannot go outside the country.Countries are now opening up to us, however, I don't think they realize that our PM, does not want us to go anywhere for the foreseeable future."
"Not really applicable in this forum, at least for the moment since Curacao is not open for Canadians."
"Yes, it's opening up on July 8th."
"Actually we are open now to Canadians, as of July 1.Edited: 10:56 pm, July 03, 2020 "
Obviously I missed that update since there was only a couple of days notice.
Coincidentally I’m sure Air Canada deals on Curacao ended the 30th of June.
"You can book flights to Curacao on Air Canada for tne months of July and August.The problem is that we will not likely be able to meet their protocols, so for now, it's a no go. I suspect they don't really care, as the majority of their tourists come from Europe."
Canada still has a travel advisory so non essential travel is still not recommended
"Then I guess the airlines are ignoring this travel advisory, as they are offering flights now all over the Caribbean."
"We are still crossing our fingers and hoping to go in Feb/Mar 2021. In fact, we are planning on increasing our original 5-week stay to a 3-month stay if our landlord can accommodate us. We plan on quarantining here in our home 2 weeks before we depart; take the test; and then quarantine in Curacao. What hotels are required for the quarantine? Will Blue Bay be considered as a ""quarantine"" spot?Edited: 10:19 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Mercedespony February/March 2021 is way too far off to even speculate about regarding entry requirements for any country.Edited: 10:30 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Mercedes presently the requirements call for a negative PCR test 72 hours before your departure, with the results loaded to the digi card before you arrive. It states you must quarantine if you are found to be positive while you are in Curacao otherwise it doesn't look like quarantine is necessary, though we all know protocols around these things are rapidly evolving right now."
"Hello. I just checked the Air Canada flight schedule, and they only have weekly flights leaving on Sunday, so the 72 hour COVID-19 test requirement will be impossible to meet.Labs in Ontario do not process tests on the weekend, so any results from a test done on a Thursday would not be available until at least the following Monday, likely, not until Wednesday or Thursday of the following week.As it stands, this will not allow any Canadians to come to Curacao, with current protocols in place.I wish there would be a rapid test available before boarding the flight, but, there is no plans in place for this to happen."
"Mel have you actually tried to get a test? At present with the low number of positive cases I assume we could turn a few tests around pretty quickly, and you can get your results online. Who knows what will happen if cases pick-up again in the fall."
According to Air Canada's website some seats have been purchased on the first flight on Aug 2nd. So either they know how to get the test results within 72 hrs of departure or they will be very disappointed upon arrival in Curaçao.
"I think I found a lab where you can get quick results, Sunnybrook Hospital, the turnaround time is about 24 to 36 hours.Now, to find some travel insurance which will cover COVID-19, that is the next challenge."
"I spoke with my travel agent yesterday, she said no one is offering insurance while the non essential travel advisory remains in force. She actually discouraged us from attempting to book anything for the time being."
Seven Corners insurance offers medical travel insurance including covid-19 coverage.
Francis - Is this a Curacao based company? Do they cover Canadians?
After a brief look at their site they are American and it seems they will cover anyone.
"I just spoke to a representative at Seven Corners insurance.1. They do cover Canadians.2. COVID-19 coverage is included, however, any associated costs with a quarantine stay are NOT covered, i.e hotel costs3. Costs for a 2 week stay in Curacao for an individual under 65 is approximately $115 US."
"Sorry, regarding Seven Corners insurance, after looking at the numerous reviews on line, it appears that this company is a SCAM, please avoid.There is a reason why no Canadian company is including COVID-19 coverage, and any insurance policy will be null and void, due to the travel advisory in effect in Canada.I have come to the conclusion that travel will have to wait until this crisis is over.Edited: 12:46 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"A scam? I have purchased from them before, didn't have any problems at all. Not that I had anything to claim, but from when I did my research they came out as one of the best international insurers out there. Maybe you could write to the tourist board and ask if they have a list of insurance companies in Canada they work with or know to meet the entry requirements. Also, Curacao right now has zero active cases, and hotels will have occupations between 10-30% for the next couple of months. The chances of you needing medical assistance related to covid are nearly zero."
"The recent reviews for them are largely unfavourable. With the Canadian govt still having a global do not travel warning in effect it isn’t just a matter of Coronavirus. No claim of any kind would be covered, even a minor accident."
"When I spoke to them today, I brought up that point, nd they said that a travel advisory would not prevent any reimbursement. I really wouldn't trust them. I checked with my Sun Life policy, and there is an exclusion printed in BOLD, they do not cover COVID-19 expenses."
"“ . I checked with my Sun Life policy, and there is an exclusion printed in BOLD, they do not cover COVID-19 expenses.”This exclusion doesn’t have to mean that they won’t cover other expenses caused by other things. You can still be covered for instance if you slip and break your ankle or something like that."
