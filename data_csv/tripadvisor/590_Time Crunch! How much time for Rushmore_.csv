"Hi All,I am trying to plan a quickie trip to Mt. Rushmore for husband and me this Sunday to only Monday (possibly). Our flight would land in Rapid City at about 2:50 PM on Sunday, we'll rent a car and spend one night in Keystone(?) and leave the following day at about 4:30 PM. (We fly standby for free and do this quite often)Since I don't know park hours, wait times or anything else about this park, I just didn't know if this was feasible. We are meeting some friends traveling in an RV and will sight-see and dine with them. We don't plan to hike; just take in the sight(s). Can it all be done Sunday afternoon? Is this crazy? Or is there anything else worth staying another night for? Thanks in advance!"
You can check hours on their website.
"Since the museum at Mt. Rushmore is still closed, a visit to Mt. Rushmore does not take much time. You can look at the monument and walk the short Presidential Trail. You will not encounter any lines or wait times. For more info, see the NPS website, www.nps.gov/moruThere are tons of things to see and do in the Black Hills and youâ€™ll have no problem filling your time if you can stay another night. At a minimum, I recommend Custer State Park and Badlands National Park.Edited: 12:39 pm, July 15, 2020 "
1-2 hours is enough for Mt. Rushmore. Several days needed to adequately explore the Black Hills and environs
I don't see anything on the website that says the Visitor Center is closed now. Did it re-open? We are going in September 2020.
I think everything is open from the construction project. Day to day operations due to covid-19 could change things.
