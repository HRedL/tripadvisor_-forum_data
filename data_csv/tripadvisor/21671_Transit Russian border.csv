"Всем привет, i am indian passport holder , i have visa for Russia , Ukraine and belarus i want to know Fourier with valid visa can travel by road or train from Russia( Moscow) to Ukraine (kyiv) later on belarus ( minsk ) ?"
"There are no trains Moscow to Kiev vv, due to political situation, however Russian borders are closed anyway, maybe opening a little in July..."
"Even after things get a wee bit back to normal, while our truly wonderful local Russian friends sometimes chide me, you would be well advised to take into consideration other aspects of the situation with regard to Ukraine and Russia other than ""crossing the border"". The Ukraine declares they are at war with Russia, have been invaded, and was the first one to shut down various modes of transports...air and rail...and while pretty sure Russian border folks would not get that ""upset"" if they saw you coming FROM the Ukraine TO Russia, I personally would NOT bet on the opposite...Again, maybe me overreacting, but as far as I can see, over the last 4-5 years, things have only gone from bad to worse."
"""There are no trains Moscow to Kiev vv, due to political situation""Oh, when did they stop the trains? I thought it is only temporary, because of the corona.What about the Kishinev - Moscow train?"
"""The Ukraine ... was the first one to shut down various modes of transports...air and rail...""It's correct that all flights between Russia and Ukraine have been suspended and Ukrainain airspace closed to Russian registered aircraft(and I guess vice versa), but rail traffic has never been completely suspended between Ukrain and Russia(until now, that is).Lots of trains were cancelled, like all trains to Crimea or the Moscow - Budapest trains, but a number of trains continued to run all the time until very recently(certainly even in last year) like at least one Moscow - Kyiv train, Moscow - Chisinau train, Kyiv - Baku train and if I'm not mistaken even Moscow - Odessa and Moscow - Lviv trains.""and while pretty sure Russian border folks would not get that ""upset"" if they saw you coming FROM the Ukraine TO Russia, I personally would NOT bet on the opposite...""Border guards are border guards, even the Russians get upset, not only the Ukrainians, but if your doucuments are in order they won't stop you. It's normal.Edited: 10:59 am, June 16, 2020 "

"Sorry, my fault on trains. Currently nothing is running, Cisinau and Kiev trains are supposed to be back when korona finishes and border opens... Had flights in mind, sorry again..."
"Disagree about border guards...the Russian side has not been the one getting into a tizzy...they are not the ones accusing the Ukraine of ""invading"" when Ukrainian migrant workers come (came) into Russia...whereas from what I have heard from my Russian-speaking friends, at least if you are Russian, you can expect to be really grilled, and be ready to be sent back. There IS a difference here between the sides..."
"""Russian-speaking friends, at least if you are Russian, you can expect to be really grilled, and be ready to be sent back. There IS a difference here between the sides...""Yes, but the OP is not Russian."
"I understand the OP is not Russian...my point is simply to be VERY careful with plans to cross the border in this manner when one wide will not even allow Russian-heritage (and in many cases, former residents) in to visit relatives, attend funerals etc...note the reality is Ukrainians and Russians ARE all part of a the same cultural group, and a large number of families in each country have “blood” from the other side in their heritage..."
"I don't think that talking about local politics is going the help OP the least bit.Fact is: The official border crossings between Russia and Ukraine are open and foreigners can come and go as they wish.It is indeed very unfortunate that Ukrainians turned their back at their Russian brothers,...OK, I stop now because I don't want to get banned.India and Pakistan are also quasi in war with each other, but foreigners can cross the border without any problem.Edited: 8:00 am, June 18, 2020 "
"""The official border crossings between Russia and Ukraine are open and foreigners can come and go as they wish.""I mean in normal times, obviously, not now."
Understand
"I understand too, and agree not a place for “politics”, BUT on the ground facts matter, and feel folks need to be aware of local ongoings, and to me, what is going on now between Russia and Ukraine argues against being cavalier about crossing borders...heck, when I first piped up about air travel between these two countries being closed WAY back in 2014 or so, I was dissed by some here...only to see Kiev unilaterally do this...so, let’s simply agree that special caution would be wise!"
