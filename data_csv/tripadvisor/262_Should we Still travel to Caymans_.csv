Hello! My friends and I leave for the caymans on Sunday the 22nd. Should we be worried about getting stuck?We are young and healthy so we aren't worried about the virus. We just want to make sure we won't get stuck there. Any suggestions?
"Where are you traveling from? That Jurisdiction's return policies will likely dictate the risk of being able to return and if permitted, what the repatriation procedure will be."
Yeah. stay home. This is changing rapidly. If you are from The US you could get stuck. GC may not even let you in. Unfortunately not the best time to go at all. As of today. Maybe it will get better in a week... More like to get worse.B
"Due to the current situation and various restrictions, even if young and healthy it would be wise to reconsider."
Cayman Govt just posted Corona Virus lockdown. One Dead. May be better to postpone
"lockdown? Could you provide a source for this, please? This is the very first time I have seen the term ""lockdown"" used. It has a quite specific meaning and I don't think that this is currently applying to the Cayman Island.I have checked the government website and their Facebook page and there is no mention of a lockdown at all, just the ban on gatherings that many other countries are putting in place, and similar travel restrictions to the USA (which is also not in a national lockdown).Can we please, please, please start posting the sources of these statements? A lot of people are very concerned right now, and it really doesn't help if we post unsourced information."
I canceled my condo and flight a couple of days ago. I’ve been watching the news to validate why I did it to the group I was supposed to travel with. https:/…It says they haven’t blocked the US yet because of trade but they may stop travelers at the airport.
Thank you Rachel for posting that link to the cayman news service! Included in the information is they may not permit travelers from the USA sometime next week.
We were to arrive on Tuesday and just canceled today and were able to get a credit is a condo / Villa we are staying in that is good for 18 months. A good source to see what's going on is look at the Cayman compass Facebook page. It is a news paper. I made the decision afterfinding out that their schools are closed and they actually closed a hospital because 30 health workers were expose to a cruise ship passenger who as of today passed away. There's also a band on Gatherings of over fifty people. I figure if things are not going to be normal there I'd rather wait and go when it will be more enjoyable. Check with your place you're staying they will likely give you some kind of refund or credit.

"Good evening all..... I am scheduled to fly in on the 21st for a week long diving live aboard trip. As of Friday, the dice company is sticking to their guns that they are still open for business and if i chose to cancel, it is on me. I’m flying out of the U.S. and I’m in the at risk category being “well seasoned”...... I’m anxious to hear what the local government is doing, while I am excited to come there for the great diving, I don’t want to come at the risk of my health, and don’t want to have to take financial considerations (loose my $3800 I forked over to the five company) against my health. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!!!"
I would not leave my home country at this time unless I can afford to be away for weeks. I would go on any type of overnight boat experience. If your livaboard is in Cayman there is only one. It is outrageous that they are sticking to their guns. I am sure you have dive insurance Will they cover your losses. In any event being close up and personal with people from all over for a week is not a risk I would take.
In a word....cancel!
Even young and healthy people can get the virus and be carriers. Grand Cayman is a small island and the people are in close proximity of each other. Please reconsider your trip at this time. Hopefully your dive operators will offer your a credit to use in the future.
We were scheduled to be in GC on April 4th but sadly we cancelled. All aspects of our travel were easy to cancel with no cancellation fees. Happily we re-booked for next February... long way off but can't wait!
"At this point in time everyone has no choice but to cancel all plans. It is truly terrible and everyone is going to lose money, travelers, tour operators, hotels, restaurants etc.The best thing is for everyone to stay home so we can make these restrictions last as short as possible.B."
