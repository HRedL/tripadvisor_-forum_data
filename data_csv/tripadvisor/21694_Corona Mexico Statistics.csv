They are not encouraging although the President says Mexico has it under control. Two interesting articles.https:/…https:/…
"Interesting articles. One is doom and gloom, the other is ""We got it under control."" Hmmm.I'm gonna break away from the pack and predict this virus is basically over with in Mexico in a month (say May 20). First, we have UNAM scientists saying the newer, better models say this virus is peaking in late April.Second, we have US gov't scientists saying UV, warm temperatures, and humidity kill the virus pretty quickly (minutes not hours). Third, we know virus virulence (flu, coronavirus,rhinovirus) is seasonal and it's getting warmer and muggier in Mexico with each passing day. Well. let's see if I am wrong but this talk about October, November , etc doesn't match my view of the trajectory, based on the whole set of data..let's see how it goes..and hope for the best..."
"I agree with you , yandoblu. Hope we are both correct!"
"AMLO sounds alarmingly similar, to what our President said, at first. Then look what happened. I sure hope its different for Mexico."
"Well, I try not to inject politics into it but , to me, AMLO just sounds like AMLO."
No need to spin politics into it. Simply a strikingly similar comparison. The same could be said for many world leaders.
"... and ordinary people. People are the way they are. The thing with bringing AMLO into the conversation is that we will have to talk about your president and that will only end in tears.Edited: 8:14 am, April 28, 2020 "
"The death rate as a percentage of Covid patients is completely off as is it based on the people tested in Mexico. Mexico is only testing on those that are being ""drug"" into the hospitals, so the ones being tested are very ill to begin with.In the US, they are finding 50-80 times the number of people being treated already have the antibodies which means they had Covid, never needed medical attention and went about their lives.Many of my friends on the island are athletes and many were oddly sick in Jan-March. Nothing serious, but some disappeared from our riding group (we do 30-50 mile rides 3-4 times a week) for a week or two. Most of them thought they had a bad cold. Looking back, a lot of them are now wondering if they had Covid 19.I'm pretty fit and rarely ever get sick. But I had traveled to about 10 different cities the end of Feb and early March, including CDMX and MTY for a sporting event, Afterwards, I started feeling weird and had a number of the symptoms. I called the MX 800 number and spoke to them at length. I wanted to get tested, but they said I wasn't sick enough and simply said I should stay home for 14 days.And yes, we had Carnaval here as if nothing was going on in the world.The tests are taking 10-14 days for the results to come back.So there are a lot of us here that think we already had it and not the ""19"" cases the government says there have been in Cozumel, ""officially""So while the death rate as a percentage seems high, the number of people who actually had it and required no doctor is also probably very high.Edited: 11:36 am, April 28, 2020 "
"I was v e r y sick in January. I spent all fall in Europe from Sept through Dec. i visited Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden. Austria and Spain before returning to Costa Rica through Canada. I was in five different airports seven different times. I'm afraid to get tested but I might after it blows over. I've been in self-isolation for a month and a half.I feel Ok at the moment.Edited: 12:18 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"Robert, Do you know if the pharmacies are open in Baja Norte?"
I am not too near Baja here in Cozumel but I believe the pharmacies are open anywhere in the country.
Sky News in the UK are reporting the deaths in Mexico are 5 times higher than official government statistics. https://news.sky.com/story/mexico-city-under…
"Interestingly, they have learned that the death rates in the States are far lower... Maybe two different strains? The European strain like on the US's East Coast vs. the Asian Strain on the West Coast.... Who knows..."
"Hi all, interesting posts, I live in the UK so we getting hit pretty hard at the moment entering our 7th week of lock down. We have had our Europena holiday cancelled already so are maybe looking at 2 weeks on the Caribean coast mid November. What are your thoughts about things being OK by then?? TIA Steve"
"Hi Steve, I am in the same boat mate - too early to say still unfortunately.I looked at Nov, and am now thinking Feb/Mar '21 may be a safer bet - who knows.Once the antigen testing announced today is rolled out, we may have a better idea of the UK's overall infection rate, however, theres no definitive answer on whether that makes you immune, or if it does, for how long.I fear that holidays wont be the same for a long while. You then have to factor in the willingness of the country you are travelling to, to allow foreign 'non-essential' travel into their country.Will they have a quarantine period? Akin to what the UK are bringing in next month.If you can get a flexible flight ticket and a free cancellation hotel, then crack on - otherwise, my advice would be to wait it out.David"
What is the current status of flying to cancun july 1 st.
Will playa del carmen open hotels in July.
"Where are you flying from, Daniel? Cancun airport hasn't been closed, and American Airlines has flights to Cancun now. Other airlines have been making announcements but the dates keep changing so I haven't kept up with the changes.June 1 has been announced as a *POSSIBLE* opening date for some hotels, but we'll have to wait and see. I know some hotels never closed, and one near me is still open."
"More info for Daniel (Post #15)...Airlines launch offers of up to 80% to CancunThe city's International Airport maintains less than 40 operations daily.by: Stephani BlancoMonday, May 18, 2020Cancun.- The airlines began to offer flights with discounts of up to 80% for trips with flexibility of changes, in search of attracting travelers, after losing only in Quintana Roo more than eight million 400 thousand seats.Faced with the reopening of economic activities that are expected to start from June 1, the airlines have started with flight promotions, which in the case of Cancun even offer seats from 500 pesos and with the flexibility to change flights no fees.In Mexico, no borders were closed , which allowed domestic flights; however, due to the low number of passengers, the airlines reduced destinations and days of operations. In addition, those who have flights abroad could no longer leave, due to restrictions in other countries.The Cancun International Airport maintains less than 40 daily operations, which are at least 250 fewer than those carried out on a regular basis, with the United States and national destinations being maintained to date, according to Southeast Airports.Nationally, three airports: Cancun, Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta register 67% of international air tourism arrivals, an indicator of the crisis facing tourism in Mexico, according to statistics from the Center for Tourism Research and Competitiveness of the Anahuac University.The Ministry of Tourism anticipates that the first trips will be more by road and regional, although it expects that the tourism chosen by an airplane will do so on flights that last no more than four hours, which will favor national tourism.Airlines are also beginning to report the protocols they are adopting to provide passenger safety.Source: https://sipse.com/novedades/aerolineas-vuelo…"
