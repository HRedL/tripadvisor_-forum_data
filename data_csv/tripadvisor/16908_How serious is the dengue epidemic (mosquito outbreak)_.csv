"I read where on 26 February 2010, the Puerto Rico Department of Health declared that we have a dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico. If you have plans to travel to Puerto Rico in the next couple weeks or months you might be concerned. I seem to attract insects and do not want the high fever, etc. We were thinking of visiting in the next few weeks and I am wondering about this.Also, what are the must see/must do things? We would probably stay in San Juan.Thank you for your input."
"Your first few sentences appear to be from the article I wrote in my blog about the dengue epidemic. Here is the article puertoricodaytrips.com/dengue-puerto-rico-20…As I mentioned in the article, from 1/1-2/28 2010, there were 1306 suspected cases of dengue in PR. That is like 23 cases a day out of the 4.5 million people in PR on any given day. And tourists are not likely to get it since the type of mosquito that carries it does not usually infest hotel rooms. However, get the facts and take precautions if you are concerned- wear bug spray with Deet inside and outside.Must see things:Old San Juan, a BioBay, El Yunque, an out island beach, maybe the caves. Must do things depends on what you like to do- jet ski, horseback ride, zip line, hiking, biking, swimming, snorkeling.... the list goes on and on.Edited: 10 years ago "
"Several years ago after my return from DR, I became very ill with a really high fever for about a week. I have never felt so sick in my life as I had severe chills with shaking that wouldn't stop. I didn't go to the doctor when I was initially ill because I thought it was just the flu so I didn't get proper lab work drawn. My doctor afterwards thought maybe I had contracted Dengue Fever. If it was, I would never want to get it again as I really felt ill. Wear lots of mosquito repellant."
"We were there a few weeks ago and had no problem. But I will add, we stayed away from water at dusk (no hanging by the beach).. It was very dry the week we were there. We stayed in a golf villa at Wyndham Rio Mar. I don't know if they sprayed there, but even at night hanging out on our balcony, never had an issue."
"Obviously the CDC and the PR Health department think it is a big enough ""problem"" to declare a Dengue epidemic. It helps make people aware and cautious. Like coldweathergirl said, dengue does happen and it is not a nice disease.Dian, for your future reference, the chances of a dengue carrying mosquito to be at the beach at any time of the day is very unlikely. And the mosquito life cycle is not immediate, so what really matters is how dry has it been in the few weeks before your arrival, not the week you are visiting a tropical place. I live here in PR everyday, and have never had a ""problem"" with dengue either. That does not mean I will not take extra precautions now and advise other people to ignore the warning just because of my past experience.I really believe people should go to the CDC website and get the facts, not ask people's opinions about a health issue."
"fromm the Caribbean Business News ...Dengue epidemic stretches into second week""The dengue epidemic declared by the Health Department remains in place after 168 cases of the mosquito-borne illness were reported over the past week, Health Secretary Lorenzo González said Friday.The 168 new dengue cases referred to the federal Centers for Disease Control last week was 39 cases above the 129-case epidemic threshold set for the week, González said.""read the rest at www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php…"
"Just to add...We also live here on the island and during the last epidemic in 2007 my husband did contract Dengue while hiking in February (dry season) in Guanica (dry side of the island). He unfortunately ended up with the hemorrhagic type and it was not fun. He had high fevers (over 103) severe headache, nausea, and such fatigue he could not get out of bed for one week. When he started developing a pinpoint rash over his body on day 7 we went to the urgent care where they diagnosed him. His platelets were so low that it required an ambulance transport to a nearby hospital. Needless to say it took him nearly one month to completely recover. Again the chances of contracting this are pretty slim, but for argument and worry’s sake, and an ounce of prevention it’s really easy and just takes a few seconds to just spray yourself with OFF or a similar product which contains DEET in the morning and early evening and after swimming.Again this is NOT something that is just a problem in PR. Going to many tropical and subtropical climates where this particular type of mosquito exists you may carry the same risk of exposure. It really is no big deal as long as you know the precautions to take (see CDC website). These warnings are just to advise travelers just like many US states put up West Nile and similar warnings. This does not mean you can not travel to the area but its just meant to make travlers aware of an issue and lets them know to take proper precautions."
"I agree, we also have different issues with mosquitoes here at home. in the summer. I wasn't trying to make light of the problem. Hopefully, the problem will be addressed and spraying, etc can be done to help alleviate the problem."
Thank you all for your posts.
"this is more an indoor problem than an outdoor problem, the Aedes Aegypti loves indoor and the biting hours are late afternoon...between 4 and 8 pm. We spray indoors and inside the closets where they tend to hide.I never use off insecticide, living here it would be like poisoning my skin for months with those chemicals. mineral oil works best for me and just being aware of mosquitos while indoor.Edited: 10 years ago "
