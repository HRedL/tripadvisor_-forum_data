Going to the VGK game tmrw. Rain in the evening forecast. What would you do to avoid getting caught in the rain? Drive and park yourself or maybe uber? Never been to the arena so not sure of ride share drop off proximity. Staying at Wynn. Thanks!
Uber. After game walk to hotel of choice and taxi / Uber back. I would probably take the tram from the Park MGM to Aria and Uber from there to avoid the congestion at the arena.
"On the flip, take the Uber to Aria and then take the tram to Park and walk to the stadium. My guess, it wont be raining"
You can’t take the tram from Aria to “Park” as it’s the same stop. A clear instance of someone giving advice that literally has no idea what they’re talking about. It’s an epidemic here. 13
That was kind of harsh. Merry Christmas everyone! Tis the season!
I would just cab or Uber to the game and walk part way/cab part way after.Here's the tram info IF you decide to use it...https://www.lasvegashowto.com/free-tram
The truth hurts sometimes. 13

"Just the way it was said. Sounded like something coming from Irish... Too many rude people here. People are trying to help, no need for that type of treatment. Sort of funny how rude people are sitting behind their computers. Then when you call them out on it, your post gets deleted. Probably the best answer was use Uber. it is much easier. OP never said he was trying to save a $$$. He just wanted the easiest way to get there. And by the way I never say use UBER or LYFT, since the legal issues that you all doubt me on....."
