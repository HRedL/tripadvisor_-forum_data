"My husband and I plan on travelling to sandals south coast for our honeymoon in November and I was curious if anyone had any new information about the Zika virus in Jamaica. I believe the risk is low, but the information/knowledge pertaining to the Zika virus is very limited, especially since you cannot get a shot or be tested. I am only asking because pregnancy is in our near future and I have been told to wait at least 2 months after being in Jamaica. Please let me know any extra info based on personal experiences or general knowledge! Thanks :)"
"zika isn’t currently a risk in jamaica but cases of dengue fever are on the rise in portland parish. you probably won’t get out that far afield, but it’s good info to have."
"I never really took that into consideration. We don’t plan on leaving the resort, and it seems like the outbreaks are more towards the east side, but it is still crucial info. Thanks a ton!"
"For men who travel to a Zika potential venues, the wait time is 6 months: https:/…In principle, the WHO has declared Jamaica as Zika free, however, Jamaican doctors disagree with that assessment."
The disease is usually mild so routine testing is not done. Also many patients might not even go to the doctor. It probably still circulating but not at epidemic levels.
Thank you :)
