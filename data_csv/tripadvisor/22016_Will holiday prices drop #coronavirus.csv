Should I hold off booking a holiday to marmaris in the hope that package holiday prices drop significantly?
"On the one hand, yes. On the other hand, hotels and airlines could simply go bankrupt."
Very tricky question.God knows what the future holds for foreign travel.I think it is a case of pass me the Crystal Ball.Scotty123.
I think prices have dropped in the past few weeks going by what I have seen online
"We are due to go for 2 weeks on the 18th April.I think Turkey will ban flights from England before then,because if I remember correctly they banned flights from China,South Korea,Iran and Italy on the 1st March.So I am guessing they will ban flights from France and Germany soon then from England.Just hope if they do ban flights back from Turkey it's not while we are there,but time will tell."
"@Stay guessing isn’t productive. Only time and how fast it spreads will give us any answers, all we can do is wait & see what happens over the next few weeks/ months. As FJ said we don’t have a Chrystal ball."
"If anyone does fancy their chances booking a cheap holiday, I’d strongly suggest using a credit card / Booking an ATOL package.To make sure you’re covered in case anything bad happens."
Stay seems to have a Chrystal ball.It's only England that's getting flights banned the rest of the UK is fine to go Cheers
Our flight with Pegasus has gone up £185 for two seats this week.
"Trouble is the media are scaremongering and you can’t predict what may happen in 3 months time. I go mid June, and I’ll just follow advice from TUI. Which is who I booked with. If the worst comes to the worst. Holiday prices seem to have gone up slightly for Turkey and other places, on TUI it seems. Just got to keep positive. In my opinion, I don’t think Turkey will stop the UK or Germany from flying. The worlds gone a bit mad, toilet roll and hand sanitiser sold out in most places!!"
"Hannah you are totally right. The media is adding to all this hysteria, the news is becoming unwatchable it’s all they’re talking about. I go late May... hopefully. .we will just have to follow advice at the time. Too many people are second guessing and you can’t do it with a virus like this."
"Just looked on Jet2 for a weeks break 25th April and they have some fantastic deals.I paid around £1200 for the same week last year for me & my wife at Sentido Orka Lotus,Jet2 have it for just over £900 now.Lots of other deals so I think I will book a week in Marmaris as we’re going to Aqua Fantasy in Kusadasi with our children & grandchildren for 2 weeks June/July"
Jet2 has good deals for 1st of june to marmaris.we are going to tenerife for change this year on that date and when the hotel there got put on lockdown had a look incase we got told couldn't goJohn
"Hello John, went to costa Adeje at the beginning of January with jet 2 and we are going on the 18th of March but booked through the hotel direct and it is a lot cheaper this time so there are bargains out there."
"Hi billy,costa adeje iam going to and hopefully get a week in September to marmaris John"
"I haven't got a crystal ball,but if Turkey have already banned flights from China,South Korea,Italy and Iran.Why won't they ban flights from England in a few weeks?The reason I said England and not the U.K. is there are alot more cases in England at the moment than the rest of the U.K. Can't believe the panic buying over the last few day,but the media hyping doesn't help."
"Hello John, the hotel is the las dalias it is closing in April to September for refurbishment, it will put us on until June’s and septembers jaunt to marmaris god spares us, and the virus does not survive in temps above 24 degrees c seemingly.Edited: 4:52 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Enjoy them all,not worried about it I will be going unless government say we cant.was just curious to see prices if did have to swapJohn"
Would not like to take the chance.Have looked at my Crystal Ball and it tells me you might get there but will you get back!and that goes for anywhere.Scotty123.
You will all ways be able to fly from Scotland.We seem to be getting on quite well with the virus.But do we really want you lot coming up south of the border spreading your germs I think not.Keep up the good work Nicola.Scotty123.
"What's the alternative scotty,stay at home in the house scared to go out.know thanks,would rather go about my life as normal.John"
"The airlines will be rubbing their hands with the majority of people taking Disinfected wipes On bord for wipe down, the planes will never been as clean.Edited: 7:55 am, March 10, 2020 "
Read my post on the Alanya Forum out here now.Censors in Arrivals before passport control. They have it in hand.
If we go into lockdown the whole country will not be going in or out the country. We normally go to marmaris end of June but haven't booked yet. Noticed the flights are expensive! Thought they would of dropped by now
Italy had 34 cases 10days ago now 800 people are dead while I agree some media is hysterical not all is.
"Not hysterical at all.Italy has 12500 cases with 850 deaths.China is not telling the truth the same with all governing bodies.I heard in the UK news that we can expect 1 in 5 to be infected.Air travel will be banned I expect with numerous air lines going bust.I work in the offshore industry,god knows what is going to happen there regarding helicopter flights and if someone were to arrive offshore with the virus and contaminate people what happens then.Fortunately we have a caravan on a permanent pitch out in the sticks, it is my guess that it will be a case of buying as much food and booze as we can and dubbing ourselves up for the summer and take it from there.They are all ready panic buying in Dundee.Scotty123."
"Scotty, Keep up with the news. Someone on an Norwegian Rig in the North already has been confirmed with the virus.https:/…"
It is more likely that once things eventually return to some normallity prices will increase as firms try and recover some of thier losses.keith d
"America has cancelled all flights excluding the UK from Friday, many European countries are going into lockdown with schools and public places etc. 11 days ago Italy had something like 200 reported cases. As of last night they now have reported over 900? Deaths. The UK are following the same patterns and unless drastic action is taken the numbers are gonna be deadly. This is far from hysteria, I would imagine most Flights by the end of next week will be cancelled."
"Well there’s nothing we can do about it, all this panic is absolutely ridiculous. Good job those who survived the last world war didn’t freak out and behave like a bunch of headless chickens or l dread to think where we would all be now. I have never seen such manic and selfish behaviour by so called adults in my life. And l hope those who are behaving like this don’t have young kids, children don’t need all this drama and scaremongering."
"I agree Josephine, The running around panicking is not helping anyone, but neither is burying our heads in the sand acting like it will fix itself when countries who are a few weeks ahead of us, have proven how bad things are likely to get. In the last twelve hours LV (one the largest insurance companies) have cancelled travel insurance products for all new customers in the UK, with more companies expected to follow suit. We will have to wait and see how it plays out."
"Yes it’s all we can do, just take sensible precautions, listen to Govt advice and hope for the best, it’s not quite the end of the world just yet!"
Believe me Josephine they were all freaked out and behaving like headless chickens(and hens)food shortages massive deaths you don't have a clue. We will also suffer fuel shortages.Fill your tank whilst you have the chance.Scotty123.

"“Snowflakes “ didn’t exist what a stupid comment. There was no social media and they had no clue if loved ones were alive and well, they couldn’t send a text to say I am okay. Often the dreaded telegram came. The volunteers eager to go did not.know what faced them. I think husbands boyfriends and sons and daughters went off to war and of course they were scared and once they were in the trenches often lambs to the slaughter ! I think you need to stop referring to the war. I was annoyed reading your similar comments yesterday, so disrespectful. Some of the elderly that may succumb to this awful Pandemic maybe war veterans.My own son has gone to the USA this morning and I know I won’t rest until he is home - he did however have a choice to go or not. I wanted to shout don’t go but as he pointed out “I live in London mum. “I couldn’t imagine if he was going off to war! Some forum members posting the question should they go may have young children and have concerns for them not themselves but you and others like to ridicule !"
"I am sure in this particular thread after reading it that nobody is ""attacking"" anyone and it may be time to all cool your jets and share information others may find useful rather than bickering."
"To all of you TA Forum regulars, let's stop bashing others and return to the Turkey travel situation at hand."
I reckon firms will be reluctant in the short term to offer big discounts although looking at my flight online it’s fairly empty as is the second flight that day few hours later. (Jet2) Ive paid £3650 for our family hol in Aug full payment due towards end of May. So as I’ve only paid the deposit so far a good reduction would result in me cancelling and rebooking
Due to fly out on 3rd July and holiday has to be paid for by 7th April. Not too sure if we'll get on holiday or not but i fully intend to pay off my holiday intending to go. There's just so much confusion everywhere regarding the virus with people predicting things returning to normal around May time whilst others saying the epidemic will last over a year. Most important thing is people's health though.
"Honestly, if this isn't contained - for the summer at least - by mid-May, we're all in deep doo-doo. But I would doubt that things will be back to normal before the middle of next year; like the flu, this virus may well come back in the late autumn, though by then everyone will be better prepared. It will, I hope, be quite a different kettle of fish then."
The Uk government said in their briefing it wont peak until the middle of June. i would suggest Turkey is behind the UK on the curve and so it could be July it hits its peak

The virus is on the incress in Turkey may not get any flights this year
Reading some of these posts .are people actually still serious about booking holidays .you need your heads looked at ..hope everyone is safe and well .take care guys and be safe
Well av got to disagree with you Jim M and Trees1981 why shouldn’t people book or look forward to a holiday where is yous scientific proof that there will be no flights for holiday makers this year. Most country’s are doing there upmost to contain a virus and get rid of it so that things will get back to normal. I don’t know where you get your numbers from that numbers in Marmaris was affected badly before this happened just because there might of been 2 weeks when you were on holiday hear and it wasn’t as busy as you think ( numbers up every year FACT ) in fact the whole of Turkey had more tourists over the past 4 years respectively. Turkey (Marmaris) doesn’t just have English tourists for 5 month of the year I know I live hear. Your post does sound negative to me you may not want to go on holiday for a while after this COVID 19 hopefully they can contain or eradicate it but there is thousands that hope they can still get away this year. I hope people can get away for a holiday a lot of them might just need the break.
"Totally agree Jim and Trees.It’s great to be positive, but in this situation we have to be realistic too, and it’s extremely doubtful there will be any holidays this year, at least. No one knows the long term effects of the situation, lots of hotels and restaurants in Turkey are small family run businesses and those affected are going to be really knocked back some won’t be able to afford to ever get up and running again. Very very sad, but this is the reality, unfortunately."
"Sorry to say Turkey are ahead of the U.K. I flew into Antalya 4th March and all passengers were screened by Medical staff with full PPE Heat sensors and Monitors before we reached Passport Control. On my return to the U.K. 11th March, non of this was visible at Newcastle airport or any other airport."
"Perhaps, Shelley, but the preventive measures clearly didn't stop community spreading in Turkey :( Very hard times to come."
"They aren't far behind now and it will get much worse before we see any let up, very sad to say, but it is the case."
"Yes as l said they are fast catching up. It’s very sad and things aren’t going to get better anytime soon. It was hoped the warmer weather would help kill it off faster. However the latest prediction by the experts is it’s not going to make any difference. This wasn’t the news we hoped to hear. Very sad for everyone, not least the victims and families of those who haven’t survived this horrendous disease."
"Yes Steve agree. Very, very sad times."
"Holidays are the least of our problems in this present crisis.Peoples lives are what all that matter, both here, in Turkey and all the other countries where people, including many young ones, are dying."
"Agree.Edited: 1:11 pm, April 04, 2020 "
Not so cringe worthy now eh
