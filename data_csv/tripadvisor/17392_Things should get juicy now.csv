World Health Organization just reported on CNN (everyones' favorite) that the Swine Flu (H1N1 or whatever) is UNSTOPABLE......I'm just sayin'
There is so much of it in the Northeast that i am going to Cabo to avoid it:)
"Swine flu, bird flu, SARS, West Nile virus, killer bees, toxic mold, or any other pandemic, epidemic, or plain old break out - it won't keep me home hiding under my covers."
"If I'm going to get the ""dreaded swine flu"" I darn well want to get it while doing something fun, rather than getting it while sitting at the office! Cabo, here we come.....besides, won't all the booze kill the flu germs????"
"May as well be in Cabo, they have less of it than in the states, let's all move to Cabo, I'm sure it will improve the enconomy and to hell with the flu. "
"Exactly NAZCLK,flu, schmoo....See you all at Rips for our prescriptions!"
"&@""! the flu. I'm going to Cabo 7/1 to 7/5Dean "
I hear that. 6 of us are going down July 2-6.....I hope I get the flu before I go so I am healthy when I am on vacation..
Was this reported by Anderson Cooper on AC360 on CNN?
"Nope, just your basic CNN reporter. I just heard on local news that Fort Collins, Co just had its' first case of West Nile Virus('member that?)....Well they caught 'THE MOSQUITO' that caused it. How is that even POSSIBLE? I caught a daddy-long-legs once in the bathtub, but he really wasn't causing any trouble. When are they going to catch that damn pig? ;)"
"Dr. Chan from the World Health Organization made a statement yesterday. That's probably what was on the news. Here's the article from the WHO website, if anyone's interested:who.int/mediacentre/â€¦index.htmlHere's a snippet from the article:""On present evidence, the overwhelming majority of patients experience mild symptoms and make a rapid and full recovery, often in the absence of any form of medical treatment.Worldwide, the number of deaths is small. Each and every one of these deaths is tragic, and we have to brace ourselves to see more. However, we do not expect to see a sudden and dramatic jump in the number of severe or fatal infections.We know that the novel H1N1 virus preferentially infects younger people. In nearly all areas with large and sustained outbreaks, the majority of cases have occurred in people under the age of 25 years.In some of these countries, around 2% of cases have developed severe illness, often with very rapid progression to life-threatening pneumonia.Most cases of severe and fatal infections have been in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years.This pattern is significantly different from that seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza, when most deaths occur in frail elderly people.Many, though not all, severe cases have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions. Based on limited, preliminary data, conditions most frequently seen include respiratory diseases, notably asthma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and obesity.At the same time, it is important to note that around one third to half of the severe and fatal infections are occurring in previously healthy young and middle-aged people.Without question, pregnant women are at increased risk of complications. This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus, like this one, that preferentially infects younger age groups.Finally, and perhaps of greatest concern, we do not know how this virus will behave under conditions typically found in the developing world. To date, the vast majority of cases have been detected and investigated in comparatively well-off countries. Let me underscore two of many reasons for this concern. First, more than 99% of maternal deaths, which are a marker of poor quality care during pregnancy and childbirth, occurs in the developing world.Second, around 85% of the burden of chronic diseases is concentrated in low- and middle-income countries.Although the pandemic appears to have moderate severity in comparatively well-off countries, it is prudent to anticipate a bleaker picture as the virus spreads to areas with limited resources, poor health care, and a high prevalence of underlying medical problems."""
"ONG, the WHO has stepped it up again???? Isn't this flu thing less dangerous than the regular annual flu that kills tens of thousands??I'd suggest eating more Gordo Lele's tacos to boost your immune system.In other news, 47.5 % of all statistics are made up on the spot. Don't believe the hype.... Flava Flav!!!!Jerry88"
