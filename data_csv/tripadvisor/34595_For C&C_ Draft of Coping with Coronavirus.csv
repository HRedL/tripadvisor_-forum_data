"I understand that coronavirus is on everybody's mind nowadays. So I appreciate your effort. I really do but this topic is not really travel related. An average traveler is not able to stock 2 weeks supply of food or one month supply of medication. Your info re first aid and Health/safety are all good, but again not really travel related. I think it's better if you can find more appropriate forums to post your excellent info. I'm only saying this as I see so many non travel related topics on this forum these days."
"I take your point, Dr. Shibuyakko, and appreciate the way you express it (so easy to misconstrue tone in emails and online :-)One reason I posted here is that it's possible travelers in Japan and elsewhere might well find themselves caught up in quarantine situations, voluntary or otherwise. I thought this info might be of help to them as well as to expats like myself (who also look to these boards for important info).Don't mean to be defensive, or to start an argument. And I respect your input, and specifically your point that this board is getting a little hard to navigate with all the Coronavirus-related posts. Just explaining my rationale.Thanks again for your input!"
"I'm happy to see that the moderators have restored my post re: precautions for travelers, locals, and expats has been restored. I have since posted the story as Coping with Coronavirus in Japan, at Home, and Abroad at https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/coping-with-coronavirus-in-japan-and-abroad-169934c21669If, however, you have any useful input on the subject, i would still love to hear it :-) I can always update the post.Otherwise, I consider this matter closed and am happy to move on to other topics.Thanks to the moderators, and to the members of this forum who supported me in threads or through Private Messages."
