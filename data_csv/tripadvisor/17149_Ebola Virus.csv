We're going to S. Africa and Victoria Falls in July. Is there any concern about the spread of Elbola Virus from West Africa? Do we need to cancel our trip? Thanks for your advice.
"There have been outbreaks of this virus before in various parts of Africa, and it's not yet turned into a continent wide epidemic."
"Not of what we know so far, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Botswana are Ebola free countries. We have on our website a weekly update about Victoria Falls, please visit it and check for some information that might be helpful.

"Only you can decide whether to cancel your trip, but personally I would not do so. We were briefly in Uganda (en-route to Rwanda) during an Ebola outbreak and it never occurred to me to cancel my trip. The WHO has comprehensive information on ebola and other tropical diseases at www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/ Africa is a vast continent , the distance between Johannesburg and Guinea is about 3500 miles, just slightly over the distance between LA and Quito in Equador. Its hard to imagine anyone would cancel a trip to LA because of a tropical disease outbreak in Equador."
Thanks for all your advice. I'm so excited and look forward to having this trip. Won't cancel in case it is really necessary.
"Hi!!! We are going to Zambia next tuesday, i'm a little afraid.Whatsapp do you think about ebola? Is sure to travel there? The trip is from Vic falls to Cape town (Zambia, Botswana, Namibia and Southafrica). The flight is from london to Johannesburg, and then to Livingstone."
"Do not worry about Ebola. It is a sensationalized story for the news media. The 3 countries with infections have over 21,000,000 people and the total death total in 6 months is less than 990 people. It is NOT a highly contagious virus and is hard to ""catch"". It is not transmitted via air. You could walk in to a room of infected Ebola people and sit next to them, touch them and not get the virus. It is only transmitted through infected fluids and direct fluid contact into open wounds, mucous membranes or eyes.Not to mention, you will be thousands of miles from the infected countries. You are just as close to the virus where you sit in Spain as you will be in south africa. I am not sure why you would be concerned. It is of no concern to tourist traveling to Africa, even if traveling to west Africa (which you are not). The media is the reason for the uproar and scare. Do not worry."
