I just heard about it. I am very happy about this!

"Twitter is blowing up with ""Ahh know mah rights"" tweets over this. But it seems a reasonable action to take - to as strongly as possible instruct citizens to wear masks in order to corral the spread of the virus. It's clearly in our greater interest to do so. But it somehow, stupidly, became political. Thank goodness leaders from all aspects of the political spectrum are stepping up to encourage mask wearing (and good hand hygiene and social distancing).How is this controversial?"
I caught the tail end of the press conference this afternoon. I'm all for it.
"Yes, I heard, but it won’t make a difference for many (most) people who don’t already wear masks. ~ Colleen"
"My usual stomping grounds (Capitol Hill, Roosevelt District, one recent trip downtown) people were already doing this for the most part. Not bikers, but pedestrians on the sidewalks (or ducking into the street for doing social distancing) were wearing masks or at least had them around their neck and pulled them up if passing more closely."
"Pretty high usage in my area, too. Not 100%, but pretty close in grocery stores and Lowes, less so at the auto parts store."
"I am seeing more folks wearing masks in some way, but not actually covering the mouth and nose. Usually I can turn my back to them or choose another checker at the grocery store if that person does not cover properly. I guess those folks are being somewhat compliant.Sigh."
"Most places I go, most people are wearing masks. My husband has been to Home Depot and Lowes a few times though and he said he is by far in the minority by wearing a mask. And then then is the whole Flower World debacle in Maltby. I have shopped there a lot, and when I received the mass email from the owner about not allowing their employees to wear masks and the comments he had, I wrote back saying that I would not shop there anymore. One employee quit over it and filed aa complaint with L&I. This was before Inslee's announcement yesterday so this will be interesting to see how it plays out. The owner talks about it being a working farm, but the areas where customers are is hard to distance, etc. This is sure to be a big blow up. I just want to smack that man upside the head."
"The only thing we can do with regard to businesses that defy the mask requirement is to vote with our feet. That's tough for me, because I make a point of shopping locally, but the reality is that most local retail shops in my right-wing town (north Whatcom County) are intentionally resisting masks. Yes, it's political to them. And I can 110% guarantee that a statewide mandate is only going to make them dig their heels in deeper. Our county is seeing a rapid rise in cases and can't keep up with the testing. We would have been able to apply for Phase 3 today, but we're drastically backsliding thanks largely to towns like mine. Cutting off the nose to spite the face. Terrific. ~ Colleen"
"We have this rule in California and it works well.Yes, you do need to remember to put your mask on in public but we soon got used to it.It is to help others stay healthy so its not a big deal.The only downside I have had is that it sometimes fogs my sunglasses when I wear mine.Not a biggy....Happy to see that WA has adopted this very good health practice."
"Yabbut like I said, having a rule & people following a rule are not one & the same. ~ Colleen"
"Colleen—I totally agree. I wrote the owner the other day and told him he lost a customer. Apparently a lot of other people did as he sent out another mass email defending his position. One of his comments was that masks don’t work and are unhealthy. I am not sure if he is ignorant or just stupid, but it is frustrating."
"Our otherwise-unknown corner of the world was front & center on NPR’s All Things Considered today. People close to me are the likely one reason why, but others’ choices are not in my control. And so it goes.~ Colleen"
"My thinking on this is that yes many us in many areas have been and will continue to wear masks inside. I'm thinking more about places that will be resistant to this, as is being talked about. I personally don't where one outside and don't seem to get very close anyone. Air movement is the key."
"Yakima needed this mandate! We have the highest number of cases in the entire Western USAAs of last week barely 25% wearing masks in grocery stores, Home Depot etc. no wonder we are still in Phase one. Our only hospital is at capacityAlready today I see improvement BUT just saw on local news Yakima County Sheriff office will not ""enforce"" this.! Woman interviewed on TV said it was ""mind control"" & her constitutional right NOT to wear a mask.However, most stores can refuse service to those without masks. ??Costco has sign, which I love, ""No shoes, no shirts, no masks--NO SERVICE"""
"I just don't understand the resistance. It seems such a stupid way to ""make your stand"" or express your personal ""freedom""."
"Many counties aren’t going to genuinely enforce the mandate, and honestly, there is no means of enforcing it anyway. It sounds good in theory, and I support it, but I doubt it will make a real difference in practice. ~ ColleenEdited: 12:39 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"I just did my Friday morning shopping. Senior hour at Costco was unchanged, they had already been requiring masks. The big difference was at Safeway. I only saw two people in the entire store without masks. Everyone else was wearing theirs. My first reaction on the non-mask wearers was a little harsh. I saw them as “uncaring or selfish”. Then I thought about it a bit more and realized that they could have medical reasons that preclude wearing the masks and that I should not be judging. Even if only 90% of the population is wearing the masks, it will certainly have a positive impact on slowing the spread of the the disease. I’ll continue to do my part to help protect the community."
"The annoying ones are the folks who wear a mask pulled down to expose their nose or their nose & mouth. It's obvious that they know they 'should' be wearing a mask, but they are not actually wearing it."
"Actually, a neighbor uncovers her nose because if she doesn’t, it’ll fog up her glasses. I tried it out of curiosity and she’s right. So that’s understandable...at least she’s trying. Other option is no mask at all.I’m torn on the masks. I don’t mind wearing one, but I think there are bigger problems—schools still trying to have graduation, malls reopening, etc."
I disagree. There are other options for folks who wear glasses. The internet is full of suggestions. Those folks with glasses need to try other mask styles to find one that works.
"I headed north a bit today for the butcher. A sign on the door said ""masks are optional here"". I cautiously entered. They are allowing only 2 people in the lobby at a time (it is really small) and the two people in the front were wearing masks, but nobody was in the area where they are processing the meats. Then I stopped at Jimmy John's to get sandwiches for hiking tomorrow. All the employees were wearing masks, but one kid took his off and had it hung on one ear. He was wandering around, talking to everyone, including the manager. I was stunned. Finally he saw my look and put the mask on and walked away. As I was leaving, 3 separate people entered without masks at all. There are so few reasons why one should not wear a mask. I have heard several doctors talk about this, and mostly it is psychological such as PTSD or severe claustrophobia. I wear glasses some of the time and masks work just fine if you find the right style and fit. That is why there are some with little metal (?) bands in them so you can bend them around your nose and your glasses do not fog up. My best friend is a nurse and wears glasses every day, as do thousands of other medical professionals so I don't buy that as an excuse.I am not surprised about Yakima at all, having lived there several times. I am disappointed to see the sheriff has no intention of enforcing the mandate, but then again, our own sheriff said he would not enforce the stay home thing when this all began. It is very frustrating, especially for areas like Yakima that have such high numbers. They have run out of hospital beds and are transferring patients to the Seattle area. With all the agriculture there and coming into season, it is only going to get worse. I remember being on the road crew there and know the work environments. The mandate needs to be enforced.We are going hiking tomorrow and I already have our masks attached to the front of our packs for ease of access."
"""Masks are optional here"". Um, okay....except as of today, they aren't. Case in point about the forcefulness of the statewide mask directive. Most of the excuses to not wear a mask, or not wear it properly, are just that. ~ Colleen"
"Colleen--I know, I couldn't believe the sign. But then I could, sadly. I agree, excuses. I just wish everyone would do their part."
So did you give them your business? ~ C.
"Colleen--Yes, I did, but only because I drove that far for it. I could have taken a stand and driven away, but I needed to fill the freezer. I was very conflicted, but did cave."
"I ran screaming out of the partially enclosed Port Angeles Farmers' Market last Saturday when some jerk waltzed in without a mask. This is not an exaggeration. The market had restricted the entrance to one ramp, a volunteer at the end of the ramp spritzed hand sanitizer on those entering, and everyone was supposed to keep 6 feet apart. After several nervous minutes, I had finally reached the front of the line to buy a loaf of Pane D'Amore sourdough, when the The Jerk strolled by. I called out to him about the lack of mask. He stared at me. I called out to the volunteer at the entrance. The poor woman said she could not require a mask. At that point, I screamed, ""I'm never coming back,"" and barged up the steps that were blocked off.Why did I make this ridiculous scene? Because I wanted everyone in hearing distance to know that masks are not optional in an enclosed space. I wrote the president of the market to let her know that I and my husband, who helped start that market years ago, were never shopping there again. If the merchants of Clallam County want my money, they better make me feel safe. Otherwise, Sosio's Vegetables, Pure Food and Fish , D'Artagnon, Heritage Foods, and the wonderful local farmers who operate safe, socially distanced farm stands are getting my business. I haven't set foot in a store since March 11."
But masks were not mandatory last week. That started today.
"Hello all.... spent a week in Chelan home tonight. Our masks are our routine now days, no matter what is mandated, unless outside and with our family. We feel masks are more to protect others more than ourselves. Most businesses that were open preferred masks in Chelan.Had a new experience driving on Forest Service Roads out of Manson, we went well past Antilon Lake... super social distancing there. Has anyone gone all the way to Pateros? We were so fortunate to find a National Forest Service Worker that I was able to ask questions... so much information, thank all for their service ❤️Edited: 11:49 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"I’ll repost, my question was off topic...Sorry!"
"cabo--Yes, I've been to Pateros and beyond, why? Our son and his gf were in Omak last weekend and couldn't get out of there fast enough with the lack of mask wearing. Same for when they went through Winthrop. Like you, we consider masks a normal way of dressing now, just like putting on shoes."
"Yes, I've also been to Pateros, but I'm not sure what it is you're asking, cabo...?I spent two nights in Winthrop last weekend/week, and for the most part, people were being very conscientious about wearing masks. This is at my inn, the two restaurants where I got take out and one restaurant where I dined in, the bookstore ~ and also at the bakery & grocery in Twisp. The general store on the corner (in Winthrop) was an exception, which isn't surprising. ~ Colleen"
"I probably wasn’t clear enough, was asking if anyone had taken the Forest Service Roads from Manson to Pateros, not on the highway. So not necessarily about Pateros but the adventure getting there on the back Forest Service Roads, seeing Cooper Mountain and other lookout areas along the way. We only came across a few people on motorcycles and driving Gators, none in a full size truck that we travel in, I worry about road width and availability of turn arounds as there are very severe drop offs."
"Colleen--You might have run into our son/gf at the twist bakery:) Cabo--I have been on a ton fo FS roads, but not that one. I got our hiking today with our daughter. Glad we went early, but geez! Half way through it became like Disney and no-one was distancing AT ALL, and we counted, only 6 others had masks on out of over 100 people we saw. The parking lot was overflowing, yet people still parked and blocked many vehicles in. One elementary age kid even asked his parents what we had on our faces. Seriously, as if the kid has never seen anyone in the mask in the last few months???? But by what we saw, I am sure that was new to him. We had out masks attached to out packs so that we could put them on in an instant. The first half of the hike was good and people were distancing, but later on it turned into a sh*tshow. We were SO disappointed in people and based on what we saw, our numbers are sure to spike. There were many groups of at least a dozen people. Next weekend is backpacking much further east. Looking forward to being far far away from people. There is absolutely no excuse for what we saw today."
"Mtngrl, thanks for replying, I was thinking you may have been. I’ve been doing lots of research online today and have come up with a plan but will reconfirm before we venture out with the local FS employees. Walked to the Chelan office the moment we returned but it was unmanned, thinking Covid... Very disturbing about the young person you ran into asking about face masks, yep it’s like putting on shoes either on, or in my purse, or if wearing a shirt with pockets, it’s hanging out lol.Hoping that the mask requirement keeps us ahead of the curve and we don’t go backwards. Lots of trail heads over Snoqualmie packed with cars when we came home yesterday. Nothing to advise on restaurants etc. I literally packed my refrigerator from home and went to the market for fish and meats to bring over to Chelan, we had a place with a kitchen so cooked in house for all meals which we normally always do. We day trip out most days packing a lunch."
"Cabo--Are you part of any hiking group online? They are a wealth of knowledge. We stopped for a little break at a creek yesterday and it is a very small area, only enough for a few people even without Covid. One family came up behind us and just stood, waiting for us to leave, but they literally got there about 15 seconds after us and watched us walk there. They could wait or go to another spot. But they were really rude about it and way too close. Another couple came up, holding masks in their hands, and proceeded to get within about 2 feet of us to try and let their dog get in the water. We were stunned and the looks we gave told them to move along, which they did to another spot. But they never even attempted to put their masks on, just holding them in their hands. We purposely stay away from anything off of 90 as that is a nightmare right now, mores than usual. This coking weekend is a 3 day backpacking trip and I cannot wait to get away from people. Same for our backpacking trip in a month. We are headed to a cabin next month as well and are taking everything with us in a cooler and cooking there, not stopping anywhere. It will be the cabin and hiking, just us. The rental agency is doing a lot in regards to the cleaning for Covid, such as new vacuum bags for each cleaning."
"What hike was it, Mtngirl? I’ll make sure to avoid it ~ although I tend not to do any hiking in the central Sound region anyway. You’re fortunate to be able to go backpacking to avoid the crowds. My sons are my only hiking partners and working more often than not, so I’m usually solo and limit myself accordingly. Unfortunately that means hikes that are more accessible to the masses as well. I was pleasantly surprised, though, by the relative lack of people on the trails I hit last week, though.~ Colleen"
"Colleen--It was just outside of Leavenworth. It's an easy trail, which is just a tradition for my daughter and I to do once a year. But we have never seen it like this, absolutely mobbed. Heck, even Colchuck has been a mess and the rangers have been hanging out there. On our way home we thought we might stop in Leavenworth for Art in the Park real quick, but even highway 2 was more of a mess than I have seen it at Christmas time. We are headed east 3 hours this weekend, to an area with a lot of snakes, so hopefully that will cut down on the masses."
Mtngrl ~ I am enjoying your hiking reports as we stay Safe At Home and my partner regains strength after surgery. (My son prefers to hike areas with snakes as he likes snakes! I am looking forward to your upcoming reports.)
"PacificNWFamily--Thank you:) I am terrified of snakes, but will take those over selfish people anyday;) I am just happy to be able to get out more this summer since I had knee surgery last summer and that limited me. I hope your partner has a quick recovery."
"Thank you for your well wishes, and good work on your knee surgery recovery! At least the snakes don't want to be near you. That is more than I can say for some people."
"Mtngrl - No I am not, appreciate the tip. Enjoy your trip East!"
"There’s nothing new about the trails near Leavenworth, esp. off Icicle Road, being crowded. A forest service person last year told me 500/day was not unusual at Colchuck. That said, I hike very regularly and there are many uncrowded trails within 2 hours of Yakima where I live. Would it be better if more wore masks? Yes, and for those who work or have children, it’s hard to avoid public places. But why on earth frequent retail or restaurants if it’s not necessary? I just avoid them. And crowded outdoor places too."
"I’m sadly chuckling as this September was for us to be a five year planned six week Europe trip to celebrate retirement (canceled of course) and now planning a trip through the FS Roads in Central WA, go figure (yes there are snakes there throughout I’ve learned). We all need to adjust (wear masks), reset our buttons and pull back, just my thoughts."
"Frequenting a restaurant is very rarely “necessary” for most of us. It’s a choice, and one I’ve made a few times of late because I deemed it reasonable. That’s the why of it, since you asked. ~ Colleen"
"PacificNWFamily--I am not sure who wants to avoid who more. Me or the snakes, lol! Jodi--Yes, this year is very different than years past around Icicle. We hike there every year and have for over 25 years. I have never seen anything like it. We do a lot of hiking, including around there, so know what to expect. Even this year the rangers have had to crack down on Colchuck. On Saturday there was at least one vehicle that had to wait 3.5 hours until he could get his vehicle out as he was parked in. cabo--I grew up in and around Yakima. Yes, I remember the snakes! Our Iceland trip for August is cancelled, but we are rescheduling for next year and keeping fingers crossed. Hopefully you can reschedule your trip too. I agree with you 100% with masks, desert and pull back. My husband wants to go see his parents on the peninsula. We won't stay with them for various reasons, so would need to camp preferably, but otherwise a hotel which is not sound appealing at all to me. The ferry ride would be ok, but I would absolutely stay in the car. I am just not there yet for trusting others to do their part. I have been to one restaurant a week ago, dining outside, and it was ok, but I was still very uncomfortable and don't care to do it again any time soon."
"Mtngrl, we’ve been traveling around the state due to further-ranging trip cancellations. We’ve found cabins or Airbnb work very well. We choose ones that follow protocols and never need to be in proximity of others. We do our own food, not even using local stores. We choose activities and places that are less visited. I think we can do this without infringing on the safety of others."
"Jodi--We are doing that next month. We have a cabin booked and I trust them more than hotel. The place we rented through is very thorough and had a big long list of what all they are doing regarding Covid. We have stayed at this same one before and it was spotless even then, so I know they will be on top of it. We are like you and will be bringing our own food and just grilling there, relaxing and hiking. It will be much needed!!!"
"There's something to be said for not overnighting away from home, at any sort of shared lodging, if one is uber-concerned about Covid cleanliness, etc. Realistically, there's only so much a hotel or cabin or whatever can assure. This is a travel forum, so of course we're talking travel. We want to get out & about, be someplace new/different, have a break from the routine, yada yada. But even lodging offered by well-meaning owners following protocols is Safety Not Guaranteed (RIP Lynn Shelton!). Day tripping is a thing, though in our first world reality we get used to wanting & expecting more. ~ Colleen"
"From what we know now, which is, of course, subject to change, fomites are no longer regarded as a major vehicle of transmission. You'd have to be wildly unlikely to be at the end of the long chain of events needed to catch the virus from touching utensils, bedding, furniture, etc.... The virus survives on hard surfaces for hours or days but not necessarily at the levels needed to cause infection. It dies fast on cloth, paper, and food. A greater danger is aerosol particles in the air after someone has sneezed or coughed or even breathed in an enclosed environment. Anyone who rents a cabin or a cottage could reduce that risk to very low just by opening all the windows and doors and waiting a few hours. The real risk is spending more than a few minutes near unmasked people indoors or in a car or a plane. That can happen unexpectedly on a trip if you get stuck needing a tow truck, for example, or if you stop for a meal or to do some shopping."
"kaleberg--Excatly. The company we are renting from has a long and very detailed list of what they do, and one thing is to open all the windows. They also have a minimum of 24 hours between reservations. New vacuum bags at each cleaning, and then the vacuum itself is disinfected. The housekeeping staff have to wear PPE. These are just a few things, but from the list I am very comfortable going there. As you say, I am more apt to catching it from going to the grocery store etc."
"Right. Exactly. I think some of us are talking past each other, which is fine. To worry about dining outside, briefly sharing space on a ferry deck, or passing unmasked people on a trail ~ yet taking comfort in a rental that changes out vacuum bags. It’s false assurance. If you’re that concerned, I think you should focus on day trips. Which, given what this corner of the world has to offer, is still a bounty.~ Colleen"
"Colleen— when you are not able to distance on a trail, it is part of the state mandate to wear a mask. We were on a trail that was maybe 2 feet wide with nowhere to go. So yes, I absolutely put a mask on."
"There are lodgings that do what they can (I believe they are doing their very best right now) and we can always do more... washing our own bedding if there are no laundry services available a sink or wash basin works well, dry in the sun, it’s out right now! A reminder though we all have our travel patterns “not traveling”... is just fine too."
"I just got back from a backpacking trip with our daughter for the last few days. It was fantastic!!! We were out near Quincy, so far from a lot of people. The trails there are side, but it was SO nice because every person we saw. except for one, put a mask on when encountering other people. Everyone was so considerate! Again, we kept our masks attached to our packs and could grab them quickly. There are no trees at all around there, so you could usually see or hear people with enough warning to put the mask on on time. Most of us were not getting off the trails much because of the ticks and snakes. On our way home we stopped in Cashmere at the aplets and cotlets store, and masks were required and everyone wore them, and properly I might add:)We also stopped at a place to pick up a burger in Leavenworth on our way home and they had one side for orders and the other side of the building for pickup. Everyone was distancing and all but one person we saw had masks on. It was nice to see more people wearing them!"
"Mtngrl ~ great report. Can you help me with this statement? I can't figure out your typo / autocorrect. ""The trails there are side"" Did you see any snakes?Glad to hear that there were so many folks wearing masks."
"PacificNWFamily--Oops, lol, the trails are wide:) Yes, we saw a rattlesnake early on, about the first half mile heading in. It was a juvenile and was curled up in the grass and I would have stepped right next to it, but thankfully it made a small movement and I saw it in the knick of time. We stopped, slowly backed up and watched it watch us. We kept backing up and then it finally slithered away. The good thing is it made us very aware the rest of the time. My daughter saw another snake, but it was not a bad one. No ticks either!"
"Good to hear about your positive experiences, Mtngirl. I love eastern WA, but don't want to be on the lookout for rattlesnakes while I'm hiking ~ especially not when I'm alone. Ack!~ Colleen"
"Colleen--My daughter did ask me what we do if either of us were bit. I explained it all to her, but not sure that in reality it would have been ideal. Trying to keep a low heart rate I think would be impossible, especially in the heat, lol."
"Mtngrl... fabulous trip, a snake or two regardless! Let’s hope masks become more of the norm than not and social distancing as well. Glad you had respectful hikers when you passed along the trails. Let’s hope for the same in all of our day to day necessary outings."
"Trails are ""wide"". Of course. Thank you. :)"
"You have heard the saying ""money is the root of all evil""Well the ""lack of money"" here in Yakima county is apparently a great motivator.Stuck in Phase one for months with numbers of cases skyrocketing ( up to over 7,000) Mask usage barely 25 %Merchants and local businesses upset about loss of revenue due to restrictions of Phase One, Big local TV coverage urging everyone to wear masks as directed by Gov. Inslee. He up graded us to Phase 1.5 (maybe as a motivator )AS of June 25, I am amazed at the response. As I said, money is a great motivator. I now see many stores have signs ""No mask...No service"" Customer response looks promising.Although, local Sheriff announced his department would not cite offenders....."
