"We literally just finished paying off our holiday to Kenya this month and I have just found out that I'm pregnant. Our holiday is in December, I will be in the first and therefore most sensitive trimester of my pregnancy.I have heard contradicting information about whether Zika is a risk in Kenya.CDC - Positive riskWHO - Area with established competent vector (malaria mosquitos) but no known documented past or current transmissionUK GOV - Negative (refers to WHO)However, I'd also like to point out that I attract all sorts of bug bites even in the UK and even if I dowse myself in DEET. I went to Croatia recently and I had an allergic reaction to a bite even though I was applying and reapplying DEET all day every day.Travel is the one thing I would always save up to afford but now my priorities have changed.I booked via STA Travel and the T&Cs say it's non-refundable. However I found this link on MSE regarding refunds and policies based on the recent Zika virus.https:/â€¦Obviously, this is something I'd discuss with the midwife but while I know risks are seemingly low, I wouldn't be able to live with myself if somehow, I became infected and caused birth defects to my own baby.What would you suggest?"
"Kenya's epidemic reporting system is very good, and there have been no reports of Zika in the country. The CDC's risk map is probably based on Kenya having the climatic and other conditions that could make Zika possible there, and not on actual cases."
