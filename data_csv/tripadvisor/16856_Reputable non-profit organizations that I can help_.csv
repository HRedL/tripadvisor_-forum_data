"I'm a travel blogger who has booked a Kilimanjaro climb for March 2016 and am seriously considering tying a fundraiser to my climb to assist a local non-profit organization. I would LOVE to raise $5,895 (the height of Mount Kilimanjaro in meters) but if we're being realistic it will probably be much less than that. I don't have a huge number of friends, family and colleagues but I am climbing with a large group so perhaps some of my hiking buddies would be interested in spreading the word about this fundraiser and we can collectively raise funds for a local organization. I read a recent previous thread that many local schools in the Arusha area are flooded with school supplies so my plans to bring school supplies have been set aside. I would like to know if there are any reputable organizations that could make the most of a fundraiser like this. I'm open to community/school or wildlife/conservation organizations as I will also be taking a safari at the end of my trip. I would rather not fundraise for an international organization but a local grassroots organization who can use this money more effectively. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
"Would you consider contributing to a youth centre? Some years ago I volunteered with a local Moshi NGO in a women's sewing group. They have been working to create a youth centre for training. At the time I was there, Moshi was suddenly on the radar for ex-pats and every piece of property the NGO wanted to buy as a site that was walkable for the youth got eaten up by ex-pat who then drove up the real estate market in the area. Finally, they were able to purchase property, but at a much higher cost than expected. It has been slow to collect enough to build the dream. Public education in Tanzania is pretty pathetic - I will say. There is an extremely high failure rate to advance past grade school as they don't learn English until late and then high middle school learning and final exams are all in English. Add the HIV and suicide epidemics, it leaves a lot of kids on the street or with minimal skills for a future. Moshi Youth Village aims to provide training for this segment of kids.foot2afrika.com/foot2afrika.weebly.com/index…One of the other challenges is your request for reputable. Those that need things the most may not be considered 'reputable', and once 'reputable', means they are generally on the TA readership's radar and thus already getting sponsorship.Another one I donate to works in Tanzania but administered via a Canadian joint NGO. It has been successful at improving the ability for Maasi teen girls to continue education after puberty. I know their annual budget and there is no abuse of it. Project Tembo. Their work is in Longido, on the road to the Kenya border/Nairobi. http://projectembo.org/A real in need conservation or wildlife organization may be harder to find."
"Wow how great that you would like to raise some money to help the people of Tanzania. We have visited Tanzania quite a few times and have some experience out there, I am sure others will give you their ideas.I always like to support education as I feel that this is the way forward for Tanzania. The people there want to be able to improve themselves and not rely on handouts. For this reason we support the work of ACTT (Affordable Computers and Technology for Tanzania) who are a small social enterprise who put computers into schools. They are a reputable local Tanzanian organisation, run by Tanzanians to help Tanzanians. In today's technological world we all know how important computers and ICT are yet at present less than 5% of schools have even 1 computer and less than 50% of children have never seen a computer. ICT is now part of the national curriculum in Tanzania yet most children learn about computers from a picture. We have done this sort of project with ACTT ourselves as have several other members of this forum. I have known several travellers raise around $3000 and for this sort of money ACTT will install and maintain a computer lab with 15-20 computers, all preloaded with a huge number of books, lessons and educational software, as well as running ICT training courses for the teachers. So effectively you are not just donating computers but a whole library, a fantastic resource for any school. Of course other people do much smaller projects donating maybe 1 or 2 computers. Regardless of the size of the project they provide the youth of Tanzania with real opportunity to be able to improve their lives. ACTT have offices in Moshi and Mwanza but will happily deliver and install computers at schools across Tanzania, you can decide where. Also you can be present at your chosen school when the computers are installed if you wish. ACTT will happily fit in with any travel itinerary.We have worked with ACTT for quite a few years and have visited them several times. I can vouch for their hard work and honesty. They have now provided computer labs in well over 100 schools and other educational establishments. Robert the manager would manage any project for you and you could be sure your money will be used as you intended. I can provide you with more information about ACTT and provide references for them if you are interested. Everyone who we have introduced to ACTT has loved working with them and been inspired by what they are trying to do.Whatever you decide to do with the money you raise, you will be able to make a huge difference to the lives of those you decide to help. Well doneIf you would like to know more about the work of ACTT here is a link to the ACTT website, a blog I wrote from our visit with ACTT last year and a trip report written by someone else who did a project through ACTT. If you would like anymore information please feel free to ask.www.actt.co.tztravelpod.com/travel-blog/…tpod.htmltripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293747-i9226-k7…"
suicide epidemic - according to who?tz is just over twice the rate for canada - hardly an epidemic or am i missing something - again?safari njema
"Since you will be climbing Kili why not help a non-profit that is looking out for the well-being and rights of Porters. Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project has really made a huge change in many people's live and probably saved a few along the way.There many education projects, but the results are mixed. Another project I personally adore is Plaster House. They are doing amazing things."
"If the idea of the technology in the schools appeals to you, and you are interested in a specific project, I connected with a school in Moshi for disabled children. They are doing wonderful work in providing education and therapies for the children and training for parents and families. They are desperately wanting a computer lab for their instruction. The same organization that Shep mentioned above has already done a needs evaluation and they are ready to go. If you are interested, please contact me and I can provide details.It is hard to decide where and how to help as there are so many needs..."
"We visited two particularly memorable programs. In Iringa, an artist started a program to teach handicapped people how to do various arts/crafts, including making paper from elephant dung and beads from recycled materials. Tanzanian culture is not good at incorporating handicapped folks into the society. Many families keep the handicapped children hidden at home, so they get neither education nor vocational training. Neema provides paying jobs for many people who are otherwise considered unemployable. I can't speak for the management of the place at this time - they've gone through transitions since we visited - but if you like their work, you might even be able to add selling some of their stuff as part of the fundraiser. https://www.neemacrafts.com/We are retired educators, so we looked for a group doing good educational work. We chose Project Zawadi which works mostly in the Mara region west of the Serengeti. It started as a simple project to sponsor the neediest students so they could remain in school. In partnership with a purely Tanzanian NGO, Zinduka, it has expanded to building a vocational school, electrifying and bringing solar technology and computer training to the area. We were attracted by the partnership - not an American organization telling Africans what to do, but working in close partnership. We were also attracted by the fact that every dollar donated goes directly to providing services in Tanzania. A for-profit safari company provides all the operational funds for Project Zawadi.Full disclosure - we were so taken with PZ that we raised funds for them and I eventually became a member of the Board. I'll send you a PM with links to some short blogs with pictures I wrote about our visit to the project.http://projectzawadi.org/"
i like to know that any money i give goes to helping people directly and as little as possible on adminneema in iringa are well runalso try wonder welders in dae es salaam - …blogspot.com/2011/03/wonder-welders-wondefu…safari njema
"Hi thereIf you are interested in supporting the organisation Sciguy mentions, with computers through ACTT you can find out a little more about it by reading Entry 9 in my blog (link given above). We were actually at ACTT when Robert the manager visited them and did the assessment for a computer lab. It is a great place with caring staff. Their aim is to help these children become useful members of their families and of society. The lady who runs the place told us that many of the children there find it much easier to learn 'visually"" and so computers would really help with this. There are also now many computer programs specifically aimed at helping children with learning difficulties. When we visited they were actually hoping to find some funding for between 5 and 10 computers plus a laptop and projector. They had a suitable room but may just have needed a little electrical work doing. As far as I am aware they have yet to find anyone to support this project.The organisation is actually based in Moshi, not far from ACTT so it would be easy for you to visit both either before or after your climb. If you would like to know more about the actual organisation Sciguy can help you better than me but obviously we can answer any questions you have about ACTT. You can also rest assured that there are no ""middlemen"" or large NGO involved with ACTT, swallowing up your donation. ACTT are a small independent social enterprise with around 20 staff. Every penny donated through them goes to provide ICT and computers to the chosen school or educational institution.Any questions please ask, we are happy to help.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Thanks for the support Shep. I can guarantee you that the Gabriella Centre also is run on a day-to-day basis with a wish list of many items, but they have contacted me a number of times asking if I have found a source to help fund their needed computers for the children, so you can be assured that the money goes directly to providing the project, not into administration or someone's pocket. You would be able to visit and meet the children if you choose to go in this direction."
Yes Gabriella Center is another great project doing very important work in the community.
"What about Give A Heart to Africa.....you can check it out on the web for more information. I have no ties with this organization by the way, just making a suggestion! I did some research on it a few years back when we were going to TZ."
"Thank you all for the feedback. I've looked into all the non-profits you've suggested. Our trekking company already supports KPAP, Give a Heart to Africa is hosting a fundraiser climb that summits on the very day we're summiting, International Women's Day so I don't think either of those will work out. Neema Crafts looks like a great organization but is very far from Moshi so it would be hard for me to organize a visit which is something I'd really like to do. I'm going to contact ACTT and see if it would be possible to hold a fundraiser for Mailisita Foundation, a school in Moshi that is helped supported by Stella Maris Lodge where I will be staying before and after my climb. If the foundation is not in need of computers then I'll figure something else out."
"Hi there,Thanks for coming back to us. If you want any more information on ACTT or an introduction just let me know. Robert, the manager there, is great to work with and I am sure will do his best to work something out for you.Good luck with your fundraising and your climb."
Hi I worked with ACTT on my trip last year and Robert was very helpful. I only donated 1 computer and printer to a school I was visiting. Also his organization was so helpful I wanted to sort of give back to ACTT so I asked how I could help and he states there were a few at risk youths who were taking computer courses but could not afford the fees to continue. I offered to pay for them to finish their courses. I could have just given money towards and they continue to raise rest but it was not a large sum of money so I volunteered to pay for the four to complete their computer courses. There are definitely small ways you can help it does not have to be a large computer lab.
"Just to be clear on one aspect, trekking companies do not ""support KPAP"" with a few exception. KPAP gets funding from private donors and does not like receiving money from companies as they don't want to be in a situation where they may ignore problems of a company, because they need the funds that company is donating. So I assume you mean the trekking company is a KPAP partner. That means they follow KPAP guidelines on porter treatment and are monitored by KPAP to ensure compliance. This service is provided free to the companies.You can find a list of partner companies on the KPAP website. If memory serves me correctly I don't believe that the company that Give a Heart to Africa treks with is a KPAP partner, but I could be wrong as things change.When I say you could support KPAP, that means you could raise money for them. The funds are used in an amazing way, improving the lives of thousands of people and not in the way that actually harms development (the handout).We have ran charity climbs for Mailisita Foundation, which is one of the more interesting and effective projects in Moshi. Each year the foundation adds a classroom to the school and a good portion of the funds need come from Kilimanjaro Charity Climbs. However, now that the hotel is at high capacity, I feel that there are other organizations, such as KPAP or Gabriella Rehab Centre that are in more need of financial support."
