"What this means for Sydney at this stage is that non essential services will need to close and people need to self isolate. This is the next stage in the battle and it’s changing day by day. Essential services that will STAY OPEN are supermarkets, Petrol service stations, convenience stores, banks, pharmacies . All non essential travel should be cancelled. Please be strict with this. No domestic travel for holidays for example. International travel is already banned."
"Moving this to this more directly relevant thread. The guidance available is just not clear enough or obviously up to date. There's different messages from various leaders. People just aren't getting it.Looking forward to hearing more detail on what the NSW and Victorian governments are actually planning with these shut downs. Who is policing infection control in places like pharmacies? I have a friend who works in a pharmacy and until I started jumping up and down at her, her employer had clearly not even read the operational guidance from the Pharmacy Guild. Staff were suggesting some things but nothing remotely adequate for the risk they face.. We've had years of stories of patients coming in coughing and sneezing on the staff and recently they've been breaking turnover records for the business. As of yesterday, they didn't even have a sign up let alone measures to isolate patients displaying symptoms. Hopefully that will change after I sent my friend the link to the pharmacy guild operational guidance material for Covid19, but FFS. How irresponsible can an employer get. They were even feeding their staff misinformation about the risk and comorbidity factors. There's an interesting article on NewsGP on factors that worsen Covid19 severity if anyone wants to read it.  https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/ex…"
"I just hope I can get something to eat after getting off the Spirit of Tasmania in Melbourne on Tuesday morning and on the drive home.Edited: 5:40 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Lucky I don’t smoke and never have. I’m not in any of the high risk categories either. I just want to get rid of the virus and if that means shutting things down for a while, I’m all for it."
Good luck Frommy!
"Well, is this lockdown now cancelled? Because that is the impression Scomo just gave in his press conference. I've got no idea what the heck is going on but am definitely certain the trampoline venues are closed for the holidays. :/"
"I feel they’re stumbling through this also.Just to add to what’s been mentioned about lack of details, and the lack of (consistent) enforcement by a bunch of people - it’s very concerning. I can tell you very bluntly, that many of the hotel management in Sydney, arent enforcing the self quarantine very well. Partly due to them all having cut staffing to shreds (so there simply isn’t enough staff observing the movements of guests), but also nervous about reporting key clientele for the fear of repercussions. One known example I can give is of hotels dealing with tech crews of airlines (both cargo/freight and passenger). They had up until recent few days, been given special dispensation by whoever at the airport (and the government clowns who give this authority to approve this) - to allow only a 24hr self quarantine, then turn around for another flight out. Do they stay in their rooms? I can almost say with certainty (and from what I’ve heard), they don’t. I mention this, because ‘logistics’ was mentioned as an exception to the shutdown in the press conference yesterday. I’ve been told these tech crews (one for a major US cargo company and one major Australian carrier) will be shut down by the end of the month, but they’ve had a free pass the last few weeks - it’s an absolute farce"
nsw.gov.au site appears to be unable to cope with the demand for information after NSW Premier said look at the list on the website. Surely they should give or have given the list to the news media outlets to disseminate.
"KVE, that's what makes things get so much worse. People aren't taking it seriously, or are confused about what it means, or there's not enough enforcement.Bottle shops will still stay open.........that's good in one way lol, but what will it mean healthwise in a few months I wonder?"
"At least this coastal rain will force people inside, hopefully to their homes or where they're supposed to be and social distancing."
nsw.gov.au has been up again for a several hours
"Sydney Aquarium, Wildlife World and Madame Tussauds closed as of midday today. Check their respective websites for future information."
"Luna Park also temporarily closed due to Covid19 per a statement on their website.Edited: 10:51 pm, March 22, 2020 "
Sydney Tower Eye also temporarily closed due to Covid19 restrictions per their website.
I work in the trades industry... its been business as usual for us. I suppose people need running water and sanitary living conditions during lockdown. All suppliers in the trade open as per normal too.
Good luck Steve. I hope you guys are still remembering the social distancing rule though.
"Thankfully, museums and galleries are closed, along with Biennale. Going virtual."

"This so called lockdown is very lame. Yes, entertainment venues and eateries are closed or reduced to takeaway only but some many businesses are still open. Our small local shopping centre is 90% open. Everything from jewelry store to flight centre and florist. None of them are essential. Is not not a list of what can open anymore, it is more a list of what is shut. Confused."
They said that the National Cabinet is working on a list of further non-essential closures. This will change day by day.
"Total lockdowns require enforcement. The comment at #29 reflects non-enforcement. Voluntary won't cut it. Police need to step in and enforce, as in other countries eg Italy and Spain."
"Those businesses listed are not currently ordered to close. No, many of them are not essential, but as yet, by opening they are not breaking the order."
Not essential means … not essential. No point gilding the lily. That's a metaphor by the way.
"For those in doubt or who do not believe the lists published in the media or on the actual website. Read the order and the associated fact sheet. https:/…covid-19-public-order-23-march.aspxEdited: 8:12 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"It's not about your personal opinion of what is ""essential"" it's about what the order issued under the Act actually requires"
"And that's a misuse of that particular metaphor by the way. Seeing as people love references here. Here's the proper meaning of ""to gild the lily"" https://grammarist.com/usage/gild-the-lily/Edited: 8:16 pm, March 23, 2020 "
What's confusing matters is that each state is making their own separate decisions to what the National Cabinet has suggested.
"Post 37, that is the problem. I have had the solution for 2 weeks now !!! It is simple1) The State Governors need to Stand Down the Premiers 2) The Prime Minister needs to Stand Down The Territory Chief Ministers 3) The Governor General then needs to Request The Queen to Stand Down The PM.4) Then the GG can appoint the Chief of the Armed Forces to take Control.Then we can get the Professional' s running the country. Good Luck to all, Stay safe , Be Kind to Your fellow Man , help a person in need . Check on that Old Person."
"Surely, post 38 is a joke except the last paragraph."
The problem is that each Premier or Chief Minister has their own statutory obligations and the progress of the virus is different in different jurisdictions. These are extraordinary times and the National Cabinet is doing it's best to work together.
"No post 38 is no Joke.When as Australian's we go to the Polls, we are effective Holding Job Interviews . Did anyone think to ask these people what degrees to you hold as you what be the Treasurer ???I would like to Apply for the Job as Chief Finance officer at Westfarmers .I think I would be really good !!! Will I even get an Interview !!!My Training and Education was to be employed by the Private Sector. Due to the State of the Nation at the time , there were few jobs. I did get one in the Government. My boss was very smart and wonderful teacher. He Said ,I see you should be in the Private Sector. Things are different here. In large Company you answer to the Board and perhaps 10,000 Share holders . Here in the Government we answer to Board , that is the Parliament, then we answer to 17.5 million share holders (The number of Population at the time)Stay Safe and keep about 2 meters apart.Edited: 9:37 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"Well, to me post 38 is a not-so-funny joke and nothing you said in post 41 makes it lesser of a joke."
"Well, Chok Dee it's hard to now what to say or whether to say anything at all to your rather extreme suggestion. But just in case there may be others lurking who lean towards your point of view. I agree, it's no joke. It's also unconstitutional. The Queen does not have the power you refer to. Her action is constrained by the role of the monarch under the Australian Constitution and that of Britain. The Australian Armed Forces are created under an Act of the Australian Parliament and can only act in accordance with the roles and powers under the Defence Act 1903. This does not include a takeover of the Australian government or Parliament. Even considering your argument about training, it's not a sensible solution. The Australian Armed Forces are not trained to run the country. The Armed Forces do have skills and capacities that our elected leaders can use to help during this crisis and are already assisting State and Territory Governments where that is needed."
"As expected with the lockdown, the majority of Sydney's popular restaurants have ceased trading for the time being. However, and most surprisingly, quite a number of restaurants have adjusted their operations to go entirely 'take away'. That in itself isn't the eye opener, but some of the restaurant names that are involved, is quite impressive - Catalina, Bistro Moncur, INDU, Kid Kyoto, Meijco. Kitchen By Mike (Lunch Only). Additionally, Pendolino's & La Rosa are starting a 'grocery delivery' service, focussed on providor/purveyor offerings such as fruit & veg, pasta, oils, as well as cellar services.Edited: 6:36 am, March 24, 2020 "
"Haha, always a silver lining eh? The adaptations are impressive. Great stories on ABC tonight. Gucci has converted to making face masks. Micro breweries in Aus are converting to hand sanitiser and doing so with impressive speed. We need these positive stories. I saw a comment somewhere I thought was very good and puts things in perspectiveOur grandparents were called upon to go to war. We have been called upon to stay home."
"As companies and people adapt right now, there very well may be news ways of doing things that will stay around after the virus has gone.Tele-commuting may be firmly entrenched in some companies, some restaurants and cafes may find that takeaway and delivery is better for them, and trout pouters might realise that they look better when they're not ""adapted"". (It's a joke, but I hope so).Good luck to everyone, no matter your circumstances. Look after your health and that of your loved ones, I hope finances haven't taken too big a hit, hope the economy bounces back better than ever, and stay at home if you can. It's the safest place."
"A very smart lady I know has observed that this pandemic will provide plenty of opportunities for PhD studies in a range of fields.I am impressed Warne and his partners are supplying the medical grade sanitiser at cost. That’s very community spirited of them.Edited: 7:32 pm, March 24, 2020 "
I saw today that the Bundy Rum distillery in QLD is converting to make hand sanitizer too and the Walkinshaw Performance car people will stop making parts for converting imported American utes & muscle cars to RHD and re-tool to 3Dprint ventilator partsHats off to those companies stepping up - and a smack on the back of the head to the kids I saw our riding their bikes up & down the street on my way home from school today (where I'd been simultaneously teaching those kids present in class and online for those absent)stay safe & well people helen
"I have a bottle of Bundy , I am going to Sanitizer my throat from CD19.Good Luck"
Archie Rose distillery has converted to hand sanitiser too. Sold out very quickly apparently. No kidding these boutique distillery hand sanitisers will become collectible.
"Once the sanitiser crisis is over all of those distillerys can go back to their normal production which is good, and it's great to see companies adapt and help the situation rather than go under.I wanted to see if any new designer toilet paper has come into production as an adaption to the crisis, and found this company. Whether it's new or not I don't know but their 6 pack of coloured paper for $200.00 is ""out of stock"".https:/…Then there's the online company who delivers to your home ""Who Gives a Crap"" and is totally out of stock:https://au.whogivesacrap.org/I know if I go to my local Woolies there's stock coming back onto the shelves now, same with Coles I think. People really did panic buy a few weeks ago and it was the equivalent of 3 Christmases in a row over 3 weeks so supply couldn't keep up with demand.I wonder if people that hoarded hundreds of packets feel silly now."
"And I'm happy to see that police are able to give on the spot fines for people flouting the social distancing rules. $1,000.00 is not insignificant so hopefully it will deter people.https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/nsw-poli…"
