"Hello I'm leaving for Fukuoka this Tuesday and I got myself a fever, with cough and colds. I am aware I will fill in the forms truthfully that I have fever.Will I be quarantined or deported back to the Philippines"
"We don't work for the immigration department, so we can't answer your question. My guess is that you might be asked questions and detained."
Detained meaning I'm not allowed to leave the airport?
"Detained meaning taken to another room for questions, or examination, or something."
"Possibly a good idea to go to your local doctor and get a letter (preferably in English) stating info about your fever/ cough etc. If you have influenza or another contagious disease, I would think that Japanese immigration would not be keen to let you into the country. - but also consider the gems that you spread to the other 200+ passengers on your flight... I hope immigration would be particularly vigilant at present, with a decent spread of measles at the moment."
Airlines may refuse you to be on board if you're suspicious of an epidemic. Go and see a doctor soon. That's the first step to clear before you think of the immigration officer.
"Not to worry you, but a few years again at Narita, they had thermal imaging devices aimed at passengers entering the Customs area to detect flu-level temps... My 3 visits after that, either they didn't use them, or they are hiding them"
"You leave tomorrow?? You need to get to a doctor ASAP and get them to diagnose something mundane or at least run tests to rule out anything scary. If you land in rough shape and they detain you, you could be wasting half your vacation waiting for them to run tests you couldâ€™ve gotten done ahead of time."
"Go see a doctor and rule out influenza. If you have just a cold, you can take some medicine to take care of the symptoms and enjoy your trip, but if you have the flu, that's a different story."
"If you are sick and potentially contagious, please don't get on an airplane. No one on that flight wants to get sick. Go to a doctor now."
What #9 said.
"The thermal cameras are back in use at Narita as of our arrival last monday. They were on, attended, and had lots of signage to say report to the medical facility to the left if feeling unwell"
