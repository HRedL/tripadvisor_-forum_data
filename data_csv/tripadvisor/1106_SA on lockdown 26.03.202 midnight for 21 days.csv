For all internationals and nationals that do or cant not follow the latest news:The president announced that SA will be on lock-down from Thursday 26.03.2020 midnight for currently 21 days.Klaus-Hazyview-
"Just some thoughts, POOL thoughts:Today we went shopping, no panic shopping, just what we (I) need, like lots of wine! LOL.We then went to Topolinos for Pizza, as we most likely will not be able to do that for the next 3 weeks. Coming home, I jumped into the pool, still 28 degrees, blue skies, how lovely.Swimming around a bit and having a glass of wine at the ready next to the pool, I started thinking. How lucky and fortunate are we? Being on lock down from Friday under such circumstances. WOW! Not THAT bad at all. The fridge and freezer is full, nothing to worry about. It is the two of us. We like to be on our own at best times, so how does it really affect us. We keep each other company, talk crap as usual, watch TV and use the internet (as now) and we are NOT alone.Then I had to think about all those people who or not as lucky as we are, who will have to sit in a confined space. Or all those, that will sit at home, alone, no one to talk to, to get distracted. Some of us may complain about the freedom of movement, not being able to go out and meet people, not being allowed to drink alcohol in public places after 18h00 weekdays or 13h00 on Sundays and public holidays, which will come to an abrupt halt on Friday anyway. Wedding/Birthday or any other party can’t take place. No game of golf and no meeting of the garden club. How terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!I now feel having to re-evaluate where I am standing in my life, how lucky I am to be where I am and how much it SHOULD be appreciated.Now let’s think about all those that are not that lucky, those who will be sitting alone at home and how they must be feeling. Be there for all of those that are around you at good times. A phone call, SMS, a WhatsApp video call or anything you can think of to make those that are alone to not feel ALONE. Make them feel they are still part of you and you are part of them!OK, I’ll stop drinking now!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Great post!
Thank you!

"Thanks Abangane, a nice positive attitude. May I suggest to guesthouse owners, ""alone"" with empty rooms, that they spend time in different bedrooms and bathrooms. Look at them critically and take notes for improvements/repairs/replacements. How often we have said to each other in guesthouses, things about the owners like like; they havn't tried to sleep on this mattress/pillow with that light on outside. They havn't showered here where the drain blocks up and floods your feet. They have not tried to read with this bedside light, etc."
"I had that same though this morning about the people living in the townships and those not so fortunate. I now don't have a swimming pool or bath (showers off course :) ), but at least a big enough yard to walk and stretch the legs and a slight view of the ocean from my office of which is at my house as well. Praying for them to keep safe and sound and that the virus does not get to them and affect them. At least we have our internet of where we can post on forums such as these and many others on our chat groups and that is what we should do, to keep up to date with current and relevant news. Thank you Abangane for always sharing and posting uplifting and really awesome news and shares. I was in Hazyview last year October and stayed just up the road from your place and wanted to pop in and say high, but did not get round to so, maybe next time. Gerald, what an absolute awesome idea for guesthouse and B&B owners to do. I have stayed in many accommodation places and though that same thought, have the owners at least slept in this room so that they can hear how thin this walls are or are they aware of the bright lights, etc. Really something for them to do and adjust and to add on the to do list of things to do. All the best!Hank Daries I Owner I Ulungele Tours and Safaris"
">>For all internationals...<<Especially those unable to get home due to the 3-week South African airspace lockdown that begins at midnight tonight and for which they got 24 hours notice.Edited: 10:08 am, March 26, 2020 "
""""" they got 24 hours notice.""""And they have been on which planet until 24 hours ago?"
"They should act proactively, signs and words of warning were out way before the lockdown announcement. Plus, I am sure that if they will have option to fly out, they will be allowed to reach one of the int'l airports. Let see how the situation will evolve."
"Xelas and QodI know somebody who is stuck and I'm sure it will be more than 3 weeks. I did say to him on Saturday night, you need to get out now, whilst there are still flights. I predict a lockdown in a week as Ramaphosa is following other countries very closely, which is excellent for SABut he didn't and now he's stuck so I don't have much sympathy I'm afraid"
An unusual statistic today; we are country with highest infection count without a mortality. Cape Town's district with highest infections is the winelands area.
I have zero sympathy for people who knew they should leave and chose not to.No doubt these irresponsible people will expect their country to charter a plane to 'rescue' them. But that may be difficult if the airports are closed!
"@QODI post#8>>And they have been on which planet until 24 hours ago?<<@xelas post #9>> They should act proactively, signs and words of warning were out way before the lockdown announcement. Plus, I am sure that if they will have option to fly out, they will be allowed to reach one of the int'l airports.<<Following my post #7 you’re jumping to conclusions and/or demonstrating some ignorance imo.My friends who are now stuck in South Africa started looking for flights back to the UK quite some time ago.They proactively bought tickets in good time only for the airline to cancel their flight. Then when they tried with another airline the same thing happened – the latest being when they were confirmed to fly back on tomorrow’s BA58 ex CPT but BA cancelled this yesterday following the airspace announcement.As an aside, they’ve shelled out around £4,000 and can’t get refunds – only vouchers for future travel (subject to availability) or the option to rebook to another date (subject to availability). Hopefully they’ll get things sorted with insurance in due course.They’re now staying put and hunkering down as best they can. I wish them well - I know from over 25 years of regular travel to South Africa that there are good local people who will rally round and assist. There are certainly those who are stuck and made no effort or efforts too late to get home. This is not the case here. Please don’t be so quick to judge and spout your opinions. Not helpful - and in the circumstances – not accurate or justified either."
It was announced today that there have been two deaths from Covid-19 in Western Cape. One was a 48 year old woman who died in Durbanville.
"@ a-fair-deal indeed I was reacting to your post #7, and to what was written in it. Would you have shared the whole story my reaction would be different.It is unfair to judge our reactions when you have only shared very misleading informations to what you have posted later in post #13.There are persons who were able to get out of the country, and have had probably same problems with airlines. Might be they were just luckier.I wish your friends to get home eventually, and to stay safe in the meantime."
"@xelas - post #15:>>It is unfair to judge our reactions when you have only shared very misleading informations to what you have posted later in post #13.<<Post #7 was factual. Post #13 was factual. Perhaps rather than seeing this as ""misleading informations"" (sic) you ought to consider your own misinterpretation.>>Would you have shared the whole story my reaction would be different.<<This is a forum and these are threads. Hence by their very nature and design, it's always possible to ask for more information or seek clarification. Of course some people can't resist the opportunity to dive straight in.>>There are persons who were able to get out of the country, and have had probably same problems with airlines. Might be they were just luckier.<<In an uncertain and changing situation, luck, timing, passenger location and choice of airline (for example) can play a huge part. Lots of what ifs and hindsight here, but my friends aren't beating themselves up as they know they made every effort and took the right decisions at the right time based on the information and options available. Things change that you can't control and when they do you may not have time to react, or there may be no options when you do, or it can simply be luck of the draw. That has certainly been my experience recently. I've just got back from SE Asia where my BA outbound flight LHR-HKG was cancelled before departure, as was an AirAsia flight from HKT-HKG. Had to reroute. Then my return from HKG got cancelled while I was away. Another reroute. Just managed to get out of Thailand before the borders were closed and just managed to transit Singapore before Changi imposed transit restrictions. Had I actually chosen a different airline/route out of KBV on the day I did then I'd likely have got stuck.One good thing that travellers can do is nominate someone who can manage their booking. Many airlines allow this on a booking-by-booking and/or blanket basis and some allow the passenger to set the nomination up online without needing to call the airline to do so. So, for example, by nominating a friend in the UK if it's a BA booking, say, this can avoid racking up massive overseas call costs while on hold to airlines, and can spread the load when making rearrangements.My thoughts go out to everyone stranded in South Africa and elsewhere through no fault of their own."
"I agree that the situation is becoming more complicated by each day for all travellers still outside of their home countries. Yet that is not the fault of the local authorities imposing stricter measures almost on daily basis. Giving a 24-hrs announcement is already a very fair deal, IMO.And such development was, or should be expected, at least 2 weeks ago. As a regular member of another forum, you have surely checked out discussion being held there, about ""to travel or not to travel"". My thoughts go out to everyone on the planet, as all of us are in the same ""boat""."
"@xelas post #17>>As a regular member of another forum, you have surely checked out discussion being held there, about ""to travel or not to travel<<If this was directed at me, and if it was a question then No. I haven't been on the forums between mid Dec and mid March while I've been away so I'm hardly a regular.Whatever was said/shared, I don't think I've missed out on too much. At the end of the day, to travel or not to travel is always a personal choice based on (among other things) personal circumstances and attitude to risk."
"Just to make a correction, that the total recorded cases as of today has been 1170 and with only 1 death. The other death's test was returned as covid19 negative. Total recovered at 31 people and 7 are in critical and serious conditions. For regular updates - https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"A fair dealIt was very apparent to see what was happening, when the government first announced closing the borders to high risk countries, it was pretty apparent to me that they would quite soon go on lockdownThe day following that first announcement, I just booked another ticket home for £300 on a different airline So I don’t agree with you, people had plenty of warning to get out"
"The authorities had to do what they did. Some people were too complacent and left it too late to get out of the country. I have friends in exactly that situation although in fairness they did decide to get out 4 days before the lock down was announced and booked tickets the same day but unfortunately it turned out that their tickets were invalid. They had tickets that were for a flight that was still flying but when they got to the airport Emirates told them that they couldn't check in because they weren't U.A.E. nationals. At that point every non-U.A.E citizen bounced off that and the later flight the same day was competing for routes out. My friends spent the next 3 days at the airport trying to get a flight (since they no longer trusted booking agents) but couldn't get out. They are now on a list with the U.K. Foreign Office to be notified if there any evacuation flights being arranged. Apparently the FO told them that there are 16,000 Brits in South Africa that need repatriating at the moment!"
"Lisa, I hope you are home and safe and well. We will enjoy wonderful SA again. Keep healthy, Colette. XXX"
