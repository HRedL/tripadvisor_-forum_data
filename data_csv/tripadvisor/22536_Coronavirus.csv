I hope Greece does not follow Mr Trumps lead and ban travellers from EU (or anywhere for that matter!). I need my Skiathos 'fix'. Your comments appreciated .
"Well I'm hopefully going in August and until I'm definitely told that I'm not able to,then it's business as usual."
"Already missing 5 nights in Copenhagen, would be a shame if Skiathos gets cancelled too. However better. to be safe than sorry. Just concerned for all those who went through TC last year not knowing what was going to happen and got with other companies. Very worrying for everyone if numbers are down this year .Edited: 8:00 am, March 13, 2020 "
I think from my only experience of Skiathos that a lot of Italians go there and it may well affect those booking this year
Yeah don’t worry about people dying as long as you have your holiday oh dear
"Busteressex, can’t people be concerned about both?"
"I replied to op I didn't say people couldn't be concerned about bothEdited: 1:35 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Coronavirus' is at it is ' for anyone who is travelling or at home too and predicted to escalate anywhere . Skiathos will not be unique ...
"Hopefully we will be able to travel in May, if not we will take it on the chin and visit later in the year.We may loose a visit, but those who host us on the island may loose their livelihood, all things need to be in prospective.Nobody is responsible, it is inevitable we are going to experience bereavement, but if we all are sensible and follow guidelines, we can minimise the effect.It’s our holiday, but for island dwellers it’s life changing."
"In order to contain the Corona virus, the Greek government has just announced the closure of all shopping malls, cafes, restaurants, and bars, apart from takeaway shops.Supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies and private health facilities will remain open. The amount of Corona virus cases in Greece are now 190.Five of those hospitalized are in a serious condition, while a total of 2,700 medical tests have been conducted so far.The Greek government urges everybody to protect themselves and mainly others, especially those that are in a vulnerable position health wise #westayhome"

"This was posted by Daphne Kapsali on Sifnos yesterday.Well worth a read ...""This is my first and, hopefully, my only post on the coronavirus, and it’s largely a plea to anyone considering travelling to Sifnos (or any of the smaller Greek islands in a similar situation). I am never one for fear-mongering, and those of you who know me know that I’m always more likely to point out the positive side of any situation, and make a joke of anything that can be joked about. But there is nothing funny in all of this at all.I write this as a permanent, all-year-round resident, who has become hyper aware of how a health crisis will affect a medical support system that struggles to cope with serious incidents even under normal circumstances. Please understand this: we do not have the resources to respond to a coronavirus outbreak. We do not have the facilities to test for the virus, nor to care for serious cases. There is no testing centre anywhere closer than Athens, and the boats serving us are as sporadic as ever. Anyone showing symptoms will have to either travel to Athens and hope to be tested and treated at the already overwhelmed hospitals there, or stay put and take their chances. We cannot hope to avoid contamination altogether, but our only chance is to only have a few, mild cases within the low-risk, healthier part of the population. Our saving grace, our relative isolation, will be immediately cancelled out if you - anyone - brings this thing in, and the consequences will be dire. PLEASE do not think of Sifnos (or your island of choice) as a safe haven to escape the virus; think of it as a place that needs to be protected from contamination, and DO NOT take the risk of being the one to bring it in. Even if you feel healthy. Even if you feel scared. We are not talking about freedom of movement here: we are talking about human lives. PLEASE stay put in your cities, where they are better equipped to cope, and wait it out. We are now each of us responsible for not just ourselves, but for others; potentially countless of others. Do not think individually, think collectively, think globally. Or, if individual works better for you: imagine if you’re the one to show symptoms whilst on a small island where treatment is non-existent. Put yourself in that situation, and stay safe. Stay put. Wait it out. Please"""
"Heartfelt message, and very sensible. I work in the NHS and british hospitals are struggling i cannot imagine how greek hospitals with very limited resources could cope. I work in a large teaching hospitals and plans are in place to cancel all outpatient appointments to release doctors to help on the wards and A&E.I have decided as we had booked a very small island this year to cancel for now rather than risk,being stranded or ill there."
"There is a huge debate on FB where tourists are insisting Skiathos has a hospital, so everything is fine, and the locals saying it's a medical centre, being told they are wrong.The medical centre, can patch you up, and send you by water taxi, coastguard boat or on the ferry to the mainland.It's like an NHS walk in centre, with visiting doctors and an x-ray. No 24 hour ambulance service.Nearest hospital is 60 miles away in Volos, and has just (from memory) 12 beds in the ICU ..."
"Regarding the closure of all shopping malls, cafes, restaurants, and bars by Greek Government ..is this in operation on Skiathos..it will come but is it on at the moment."
Just heard that it is in force on Skiathos..great shame for businesses on the Island. This could lead to some losing them.
Skiathos is fully compliant ...
"SL1 and Yiassas , so wish Daphne's poignant message could be cascaded everywhere . We can all holiday anywhere sometime in the future and her plea is so valid as this is about lives and livelihood in many destinations that rely heavily on tourism .As a concern from me re folk living in Greek Islands in general and Skiathos in particular , how self sufficient are they for staple foods or rely on ' imports ' ?"
"I fully understand the messages but if we take it in our hands to cancel holidays we will be considerably out of pocket because unless we are told to cancel this is what will happen. I do fully understand where you are coming from SL1. Hopefully all will come good in the end. I know what you will say, would you rather be ill in Greece and not receive the care which is required or loose £1,400. Holidays don't come easy to us unfortunately, unlike so many people who can afford to holiday 3 or 4 times a year. Again I fully understand what you are saying. Thankyou"
"Penny FSomeone said yesterday 'They were reliably informed' the ferrys were not running and food was in short supply, and the supermarkets had no stocks.Absolute rubbish even the mini markets are well stocked, and the ferry is big and blue, and has Express Skiathos written on the side.Like everywhere else, the food supplies come from the mainland, on the big trucks.Happy to advise Pasta and Loo roll in plentiful supply and Manolis has some lovely fresh island artichokes at his shop ..."
"Susie - No one has told you to cancel your holidays. Many have though. It seems likely any decision will be made for the people by others, which is best option.Acute Holidayitis affects reasonable thinking, and many of the folks in May are in the bracket where its best to be near the warm cosy arms of the NHS.Keep Calm and Carry on ..."
"Agree, been going to Skiathos Palace for years as you say for my yearly fix, please no Virus."
"They have just announced seasonal hotels and tourist accommodation, will not be permitted to open before 30th April across Greece ..."
D'ya think I'm not coming ......
We are booked to go at the end of May and have been looking forward to going ever since our trip last year however events may stop this happening.Whilst either the UK or Greek governments may dictate this or possibly one or both of us may become infected the main concern for us is for the safety of the people of the island itself. Greeks are well know to be very family orientated and elder members of their families are especially loved so we must all respect their views when considering if we should go or not. On the other hand virtually the islands whole economy is based on tourism so it will hurt them hard if we all stay away but it is their decision not ours.All we can do now is wait and see how events will play out in the coming weeks. We really want go as Skiathos is just paradise but it wont be if the virus hits hard. We have made many friends over the years but definitely don't want to part of the cause of losing any of them.

I don’t mind if they keep it and say I can have room next year if Coronavirus stops us travelling it’s different circumstances this situation hey
"A big run on Loo Rolls and sanitising products, here in Skuiathos on Friday, and Saturday, in the 2 main supermarkets, these products were in very short supply."
my mate is in aldi says its like xmas eve 100 queing at each till but no one on streets in London madness the supermarkets will be place where the virus is spread imo
Busterlike christmas eve . . but the present in the morning will be a bit more *interesting*There will soon be a new memo from government . . one sheet per sh*t.

You've given us a lot of headaches and worries with your disappearance, in the time of detonation. There were all kinds of rumors. Some swore there was only your saucepan was found.

"Looks like they are starting to close up the borders, with Albania and North Macedonia. Ferry to Italy being stopped.How long before the airports?"

"Thanks for your comments, we were concerned with the facilities on Skiathos just a medical centre so decided to cancel our holiday in May. Hopefully we'll get there some day. Take care"
"Discover 591972 We have done the same today, we were due to go at the end of May, so disappointed."
Why cancel?The refund will be in the post in due course ...
"I see Brits have now been advised to avoid non-essential travel for the next 30 days - and it might be extended.Are the apartments, hotels, bars and restaurants on Skiathos gearing up for the start of the tourist season in May or are they likely to remain closed for the foreseeable (assuming they are closed right now)."
We are booked to go at the end of May and would not cancel as that would probably result in losing money. Instead we will leave as it is for the present in the 1% chance we can go or if not and Tui contact us to say the holiday is cancelled then we will either get our money back or maybe get the option to rebook in 2035 or hopefully sooner.If there is any threat to anyone's life we don't go as it's not worth risking.The gardens going to look great and the car so clean this year.
I'm booked to fly out with Jet2 on 17th May for 10 days. I think it's unlikely to happen :(
don't cancel just wait to be cancelled get full refund just got our easyjet flight at easter to Italy refunded
"I think it is far too early to make a decision about any holidays in the summer months and, going ahead and just cancelling now isn't going to achieve anything other than cost people thousands of pounds both at home here and in those countries where the bookings have been made.The problem we have here is the conflicting advice from the media, some of which is scare mongering i.e. the government tells us to avoid pubs, clubs and restaurants yet fails to impose a ban, but we are then told this morning by a certain t.v. doctor that he feels it was 'ok' to visit restaurants and support them!Another huge responsibility rests with the travel companies and how many people are being kept in limbo waiting to find out if their holidays will be cancelled. They excuse this by blaming it all on current demand, yet cannot answer a straight point about holidays just a few weeks down the line! If these companies took greater responsibility for their actions and consulted with the various authorities then they should advise people for trips even as far away as the summer period.We can all throw ourselves on our own swords and take the bull by the horns and go ahead and cancel, in the knowledge you will lose your money, that is if you can afford to do so. Many people save hard and book just the one holiday away so it isn't easy to make any decisions now when there is still some hope for 3-4 months down the line. However, whilst I have every sympathy for Skiathos and the problems the island may potentially face, this thing could be over and done with by then. So why risk cancelling now and losing all your hard-earned cash when you can wait until closer to the time and either still go because this situation has been overcome, or the travel companies and airlines will get their acts together and cancel for you, whereby you will receive all your money back."
"We are scheduled to to fly on July 1st for 11 nights to apartments on a hillside overlooking Skiathos Town. I'm keeping fingers crossed that it will still happen. Also mid 70's with reduced immune system, so who knows."
"#46, IanEglos. I can't re-book for 2035 - I'd be 95 by then and I really can't guarantee to make it!"
DennisPhil the Greek went with the Queen to Malta in 2015 when he was 94 so don't give up hope yet. I did say 2035 or maybe sooner so 2034 could still be an option.

Some people will probably disagree but all borders need to shut for non essential travel until this is over
I thought that they weren't letting anybody in to the islands . Stay safe everyone
"#56 See the Lockdown topic, it started 6am 21/3 ..."
I hope all travel to Skiathos is banned. The people there have no facilities to cope with such a virus. And many would probably die. Skiathos will be there in all its Glory when this is over. So they don't want us there to spread this awful virus. You will have to forgo your fix for the time being
I cant believe these comments :) Its a holiday to you Its life and death to them
"The mayor has posted photos of a temporary building, being set up at the medical centre. The building donated to the Municipality of Skiathos by Fraport for the examination of suspected medical cases."
Durango you’re probably very young. Definitely very selfish and inhumane
ive got 3 hotels booked on 3 different islands through booking.com for our Cyclades trip in june.Have been talking to owners on internet its so scary and sad all have said to let them know if we can not make it to them and they will refund all my money.Ive decided to let them keep the money in exchange for a bottle of wine when we do finally make it to them whenever that maybe.Otherwise I fear they may not be there in the future without finiancial help
@busteressex - I do hope its a nice bottle of Kanenas ...
That's such an amazing act of what you've done.
That's the kind of guy he is ...
@busteressex I haven't read a better post in days!Bravo! Deep bow.#65 SL - Excellent choice.
"@Ntragon Our friend busteressex knows his Greek wines, and we both like a Kanenas. I usually fly tip him a bottle when we meet up ..."
"Most people who are taking refunds will be booked to stay on package deals in places that are owned by massive faceless, invisible corporations and should not feel guilty about it - hats off to buster, if you have communicated directly with the owners via email and done a “gentleman’s” agreement you obviously know the owners well and are happy in the knowledge there is no chance that a bank/lender can take this business, as will unfortunately but inevitably happen to many.. you may get your holiday one day but I pose a question .... How do you plan to get there?"
hello dave proberly next year now by plane and ferry hopefully mate Intend no best say hope to book same itinerary next june as we have this june ive got BA flights from city airport to Mykonos booked this year so may have to jig things about a bit but next year will book same places to stay privately
"Whole of Greece, will be in lockdown as of tomorrow 6AM ..."
From 6 am tomorrow ...No being outside without paperwork or proof of legitimacy for being out. You must have your passport with you at all times if out. 150€ fine if out for no reason.
btw buster... did I spot you in an early episode of the recently repeated Freddy Flintoff lord of the fries? The one where he buys his first supplies?
"I agree completely, yet as well as having my yearly stay in Skiathos, I want to make sure that restrictions for going there do not come into play; I have a 2 bedroom bungalow in Lehounia, and ALWAYS go in May.... Its really good to see that Jet2 are starting to fly there in early May, as Thomas Cook has died on us..."
"Exploration731794, not sure what you mean about restrictions coming into play. You do realise your flight in May will not happen this year??"

"HI, I have 3 reservations of ferrys (at the end of may and beggining of june) athina- santorinisantorini - naxos naxos -mykonosdo you know if there will be a refund if I need to cancel?thanks in advance"
What do the terms and conditions for the tickets say? What does the website of the ferry operator say?
@david P #79.What you say plus where the #### is Lehounia?
"@Paula S, which ferry company are you travelling with? And have you booked directly with the company or through a broker/3rd party?"
# 82 I thought it was a misspelling of the area near Nikotsara? My spelling isn’t the best either ..
Area around Lehouni/Nikotsara probably up towards Kalivia ...
I cannot understand the insanity of this on going debate as everyone needs to stay at home end of . If you want to get a vision of hope for the foreseeable future look up Joan Baez's rendition of the Bob Dylan song ' Forever Young ' and stay safe .....

Didn't you have travel insurance?We have Zante booked for May and Hanioti for late June to earlyJuly. All covered by insurance
"Thanks Ian, I did asume that as a possibility. I felt that Exploration731794's righteous post needed taking down a peg or two."
Helen it's nice to read somebody being so unselfish and worrying about everyone else
"I have booked to go in June, have tried to cancel but flight and hotel are not allowed to cancel or change. If shops, cafes etc. are closed and so the island is not fully open. Also Greece advise saying Coronavirus about to explode on islands. Any advise?"
"Who is your flight with?How did you book your hotel?June, questionable if tourism will happen, based on Greek reports.Some of the quarantined islands, have had the virus. None officially reported on Skiathos to date.If you drop 5000 tourists, on a quarantined island, wonder what will happen?Inclined to think, your June flight will be cancelled for you by the operator ..."
We hope so also I know a holiday isnt a priority but we will miss Skiathos so much. We are due to go the end of July.
"Hi Susie I complete agree with you, I love Skiathos and have great respect and concern for the residents, if we cancel our holiday we will lose all our money but im sure the Foreign Office will take this decision out of our hands. I feel so sorry as they rely so much on tourism , the apartments we go to the owner lives in Athens and along with everybody he is in isolation on lockdown but i also know how much he relies on his income from the Summer. I will definately only go on holiday if safe to do so for everybody concerned but will wait for the FO to be able to cancel therefore to get our money back."
"Somewhat selfish comment, we need to protect the island and if it means giving it a miss until it’s safe then that’s what we need to do."
My sons wedding is booked for 24 July and we were exactly the same... all booked with TC and now this...BUT we are all safe and well and currently that is the best we can hope for.good luck with your weddings plans xxxxxxxxxxxxx
"The government appears certain that the tourism seasons in summer 2020 will be able to run in the months of July, August and September, and hopes to extend it to October and November.However, this presupposes that international flights and ferries will resume in time.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told CNN International on Monday said that “the best-case scenario is Greece opening for tourism as of July 1, even though the exact date also depends on airlines and the implementation of strict health protocols in foreign flights.”"
">>The government appears certain that the tourism seasons in summer 2020 will be able to run in the months of July, August and September, and hopes to extend it to October and November.However, this presupposes that international flights and ferries will resume in time.<<The big question is: from where (what countries) will they allow flights/tourists?"
Worth a read ...https://www.ekathimerini.com/252430/article/…

"I can imaging and feel the concern that the people of skiathos and other Greek islands have at this time. There whole years earnings are now at risk as well as there health. Thinking of all the lovely people we have met in Skiathos. They have helped us have many fantastic holidays on the island. Take care, be strong and try and stay positive. Thinking of you all. Was going to be back in troulos with you this July ,but don't think this will happen now."
Does anyone know if TUI are flying from Newcastle to Skiathos in September 2020?
"Wendy, why don't you ask TUI?You're only going to get guesses and rumours here."
It appears not.
Gary73 you could be right. On current info you are at present but this is a changing environment and whilst TUI (and all the other major operators) are being very cautious in their announced plans to date who knows what may happen by this time next week or the week after.They are all businesses and if they can see a way to ensure a profit then we may see further announcements of extra flights and maybe from additional airports than at present.That said my crystal ball has been sent off to get a new battery fitted.
I have. They have confirmed the holiday is still going ahead. But I asked about flights from Newcastle and they would not answer the question and said I would have to wait until nearer the time.
"If talk on FB is to be believed, a Serbian woman has allegedly tested positive at Skiathos airport.I really hope this is fake news"

It’s everybody’s choice if they want to travel or not
"I’m sorry for your loss ,but it’s still my choice if I booked an holiday last august spending £1800 so it’s not madness for me to go on my yearly holiday that I can’t cancel or I will lose my money ."
"Craig, you are correct, we loose 90% of our money if we cancel, have to pay £75 × 4 to move the holiday and the same hol next year with Jet 2 is double the price, we dont have much choice but to go."
No-one can say what is right or wrong in the current situation. It is personal choice.Went to do weekly food shop yesterday and it appeared that distancing is no longer applicable.Seems that everywhere is opening up this weekend so it makes sense for travel to accompany it.

"Dear Channel Swimmer Your brother was obviously a very special guy who did a great job in public service. Everyone who died meant something to someone. It is an evil virus and it has affected everyone in different ways and some folk , mercifully, have not had anyone close to them who has been affected. Everyone sees things differently but that does not dilute your strong feelings or reflect badly on how others see things. We just have to hold on to all the positive things and heroic acts that we have seen surface during this awful pandemic. Let us all hold on to the positives and try not to judge others. It is a really difficult thing to try and live in someone else’s skin or fully understand someone else’s perceptions , frustrations or experiences - that they are different does not mean anyone is necessarily selfish. I am sure we all wish you and your family well...stay strong !"
"A lot of people truly are selfish. And we'll never change them.I too have noticed that social distancing in the supermarket (this week and last week) seems to have been forgotten. Not helped that my big Tesco Express is not limiting the numbers going in. They claimed when asked they only do this when it's not busy. But (1) far more people inside, (2) people no longer keeping a distance, (3) one way system ignored, etc.I first experienced this last Tuesday so it was before the relaxing of the 2m rule to 1m+."
"Those of us who's families are lucky to not have been through it, cannot do any better than read what Channel Swimmer has shared on post 113. Must have been awful for you, to go through.I am sure after being on a plane, for the best part of four hours, with folks coughing and sneezing around me. With no thoughts towards social distancing, Some were wearing face masks, taking precautions, others ignoring them. I would not do it again, neither would I put my family at any risk.But that's my choice, and I am happy with that. Some things are far more important ..."
Just out of interest CraigH(1)Can you not get your £1800 back because you failed to take out holiday insurance?(2) How much would you be prepared to forfeit to avoid the risk of infection to yourself and others?
"JoandDave you do have a choice, risk losing your money or risk losing your lives with the added risk of infecting someone else and killing them. I'm not saying you should not go.

"Boyontbridge. Who knows, you may be more at risk/put others at risk going to the supermarket in this country than going abroad, its a lottery. My decision to go or not will not be purely financial and there is no way I would put my kids at an increased risk. Its a no win situation but people should not judge others on what decision they make, we all have our own set of circumstances and I'm sure we would all admit none of us are experts in this matter."
Well said
yeaa..now he s gone in a world without covidiots like you
why here are so many covidiots...believers of something that does not exist..people are zombies
"The mayor Thodoris Tzoumas has confirmed that all Covid-19 tests carried out so far are negative – including the one from Serbia that caused such widespread speculation the other day. However, he has stressed that, given the increasing number of arrivals by air and sea, it is absolutely essential that everyone follows the necessary protocols and remains aware of potential risks. On the positive front, the island now has a negative pressure isolation capsule as well as additional doctors and nurses whose accommodation cost is being borne by the municipality. The island wants to welcome tourists but we must all be proactive in reducing the risk of allowing the virus to take hold. (Steve in Skiathos)Random Testing:The samples taken yesterday were by tourists who arrived in Skiathos by air.Tourists from Frankfurt and Munich, Germany arrived in Skiathos yesterday on Condor airlines flights. A sample of 60 coatings was taken and all of them were negative for coronavirus . (E Thessalia .gr)"
Yes Peter and to Sl1 @ 120 and to channel swimmer @ 113 some folk really believe they are invincible . Thankfully the 2 people l know in my area who have had Covid have survived and l know too that their regard for others shines through and would never get on a plane...
"Unless you isolate yourself at home you will run the risk of picking up this virus anywhere.My mother contracted it while in hospital.Going out shopping is probably as bad as getting on a plane for the potential of passing it on.At some point you have to accept risks and carry on within reason.

"I feel for anyone who's lost anyone to this virus, but I feel some of the comments are overly simplistic.I travel to and from work by bus, and I'm on them for 80 minutes a day, so that's 13 hours a week. I'm booked for Skiathos for 10 days, so I'll probably spend less time on the plane than I would do at home on the bus.The buses do not have the same standard of ventilation as a plane.So, from my perspective, I'm safer going on holiday than going to work.I'm very concerned to ear that some people sat without masks on, and were not told to put them on by cabin crew. If people do this they should be treated as the same nuisance as drunks, the plane diverted, and them given a multi-thousand pound fine.That should focus the mind a little.Everyone must make their own decision, but I believe it's unhelpful to say people are putting their own, or others' lives at risk.Even if they are, we need to quantify that.You put your own and other people's lives at risk every time you get behind the wheel of a car, but most of us seem to think that this is a risk worth taking.We take a risk walking out of the front door, drinking a pint, eating a burger, having a shower, touching a piece of electrical equipment.If you're under 60, and with no pre-existing health conditions, your chances of dying from the virus, even if you get it, are tiny.Edited: 12:03 pm, July 05, 2020 "

Penny - 7 out of 10 asymptomatic? Where do you get your information. The World Health Organisation have said they believe 80% of cases have no or mild symptoms but they DON'T KNOW the percentage of people that are asymptomatic.

And what about people with mild symptoms which I mentioned. No symptoms and mild symptoms are 2 different things. If you are asymptomatic you have NO Symptoms Don't you get that there's a difference
"Yes of course, but I thought that the WHO definition of mild meant symptoms which were not covid-specific,e.g. runny nose without fever and/or cough and/or loss is taste etc.Anyway, I presume you do agree that there is a large cohort of people who, if tested, would be very surprised to hear they were positive."

"It's no surprise.Serbia were at a low of just under 5 new cases per day per million people (7-day rolling average), and Montenegro were at ZERO for over a month! From the initial list of 29 countries which Greece allowed in, no one was above 10.Serbia & Montenegro are now 52 and 126 respectively.

"It's a difficult one though, we booked Mandraki village back in January, and fly out on 9th August. If we don't go we lose over £2,000, and speaking to our friend who lives in Skiathos, they need people to visit, as the season is so short they need travellers to spend money otherwise many bars / restaurants / hotels will close down. We did wrestle with the should we shouldn't we go, but after seeing the state of Manchester now since lockdown has been relaxed, we are probably safer in Skiathos, as it will be much easier to social distance, plus we can help out the businesses in Skiathos, as it would be gutting to see many of them have to close."
Mark S - yes difficult situation but I agree with your views.
"#163 mark S you booked in january before this virus started, i understand your situation and feel for you, but i was reffering to people booking now."
"I understand the thoughts of those above. However much you may feel personally safer on Skiathos than for example Manchester, this airport gives access to folk like me who live in North Wales where this virus has had ' hot spots ' recently and sure many other places too that people will be flying from like Manchester to this tiny island . I still worry about all of us who could inadvertently transfer the virus to places that are ' free ' and the pressure this will put on the very limited medical resources on Skiathos and the folk who live there especially."

SK1My thoughts exactly!!It's nuts!
Returned from a weeks holiday in Skiathos 2 days ago. Stayed at hotel Rene overlooking Megali Ammos. The island was as beautiful as ever and we had a great week. Lots of hotels and restaurants are shut and many others are struggling. The wonderful Greek hospitality is there in abundance as usual and they desperately want tourists to come and spend . They are more than happy to accept cash. The place feels very safe and I am so glad we went.
"#180. Michael, any more info ?"
We flew out from Manchester with Jet2 on 22 July. The airport was very quiet and going through security felt like a personalised service! The easiest ever. The flight departed early and arrived early. On arrival in passport control they checked you had your completed form but did not check any detail. With only a small delay it was straight forward. There was a testing station to one side but I didn’t see how many if any were tested. After that the biggest thing is that tourist numbers are down as you go around the island. It isn’t deserted though. The area around Rock n Roll bar in the evening didn’t feel any different.  I never worried once about the virus. . If it’s not for you this year then fair enough but if you are inclined to go then get out there and enjoy it.Going home was straight forward and the plane was about 50% full. It didn’t need to stop for a refuel. Back in Manchester a number of people either didn’t know they had to or simply hadn’t completed the passenger locator form for the UK. Apart from a slight queue at that point it was very easy getting through the airport.
#182 thanks for that info.
Great Info #182.We all know that any holidays are apparently a bit of gamble at present however your report seems to confirm that Skiathos is at present a fairly safe bet (let's hope it remains so).Can you state if you felt safe and protected during your whole flight experience and during your time on the island as this will give others confidence to travel and we know that the islanders are desperate for our money.I would love to be able to get there but personal circumstances mean I can't now this year but will be back next year and hope that many places on the island can survive till then.
"Latest update from Greek government. Masks are now mandatory to wear in ALL interior spaces (Bakeries, shops, offices etc)Please make sure you have one when you want to go into a shop, as the fine will be 150 euros."
Michael s how did you find Hotel Rene? We are due to stay there in Sept. Any info would be great. Thanks
"Prior to going my main concern was the flight. As everyone knows we had to wear a mask right throughout the journey from taxi to airport to plane to airport in the taxi again before finally taking it off outside the hotel.I didn’t enjoy wearing it that long but you get used to it. I found everyone, passengers, airport workers, security, cabin crew to be friendly and understanding. The whole journey was my easiest ever trip to the island. I didn’t have any worries, but so much of that is about perception and others could feel different.On the island all serving restaurant and bar workers have to wear a mask. To be honest as we were outside all the time eating and drinking I felt a little sorry for them and I didn’t have any fears whatsoever."
186.If you haven’t been before then the Hotel is exactly as it looks on the photos. Everywhere has been modernised in recent years. The pool area is excellent. The sun beds are some of the best I’ve ever used. They have shut the breakfast room this year and if you want breakfast they will serve it to you at the pool bar area.. They will prepare basic snacks for you throughout the day but we preferred to eat elsewhere. Because numbers were so small they left the drinks fridge open and we took what we wanted and settled up with them as convenient if nobody was around. You can buy your 6 packs of large water from them which is great rather than having to carry them up the hill.The rooms were modern and the absolute best thing about the hotel was the view over Megali Ammos bay. The photographs don’t do it justice. From all the room balconies or the pool area it was stunning. The payment for that was the walk up the hill to get there. It would most definitely be a problem for anyone with mobility problems.The two brothers who run the place were very laid back and friendly. We had a very enjoyable week with them.
"MichaelS -Thamk you so much for your reports, these are very much appreciated."
"Seems some Brits have rested positive, and are residing at the Aria UFN ..."
This was going to happen wherever you live or stay . Some folk get a lucky personal risk assessment and others not so ...
"A bit of news.There's recent been a spike in infections, with the new cases figure doubling around every five days.The last three days have been 153, 151 & 152, so no increase.Obviously, this might not be the end of the rise, but it's looking far more positive than it was on Thursday."
"Skiathoslife have posted that they will update the situation when they get official confirmation.Seems Skiathos, Skopelos and Alonissos have issues from the initial testing yesterday."
Are these positive tests at the airport?
Yes so I understand.
"No test is 100% accurate. Although tests can perform well in ideal laboratory conditions, in real life lots of other factors affect accuracy including the timing of the test, how the swab was taken, and the handling of the specimen."

There are false negative results just as false positive ones and many other people who may or not be tested have no symptoms at all but can be positive and transfer the virus to anyone so this continues to be a very huge lottery of faith in scientific research .
"Allowing people to travel but first completing a document which details their exact movements should provide invaluable information for the scientists to track, trace and isolate the virus .. it’s data mining on a global scale and hopefully should help fight this virus.. think positive and we will beat it!"
#191 - if you read and believe the reviews someone did say that they had a dungeon room in the Aria so maybe that’s where they have been accomodated....
"Hopefully, the second tests will be negative and they can leave the hotel ..."

"Its expected that further restrictions will be announced tomorrow, by the Greek government limiting bar/cafe/restaurant opening hours to 7am-11pm. ~~~~~The Apotheke music bar, in town, has announced it cannot comply with current regulations, and has closed with immediate effect."
"That one day increase isn't good, but it should be noted that the figures had stood still for the previous 3 days."

"Too right.I think this sums up the biggest problem we've had with the virus - we're dealing with very small numbers.I've seen people saying they're not worried because it only kills 0.2% of people.But that'd amount to 21,000 Greeks and 132,000 Brits.If you say only 0.2% of Greeks & Brits will die, people shrug their shoulders.But say that over 150,000 Greeks & Brits will die and they look panicked.Tell people they have a fraction less of a % chance of catching with the virus with a mask, and they think it's not worth it.Tell them that if everyone wears a mask and washes their hands we'll see only half the deaths, they sit up and take notice.It's getting the balance right about being honest with people and not panicking them, and ensuring they understand the figures."
"Skiathos has not been included in the restrictions announced this evening.~~~~~~~~Based on the epidemiological load, all facilities of catering sector (restaurants, bars etc) will suspend operation from 12 midnight until 7 o’ clock in the morning in the following regions:Regions: Crete, East Macedonia, ThraceRegional units: Thessaloniki, Halkidiki, Larissa, CorfuMunicipalities of: Mykonos, Paros, Santorini, Volos, Katerini, Rhodes, Antiparos, Zakynthos, Kos.This measure goes into force on 11.

UK is about 17 so I doubt it quarantines announced today are all 30+
"People need to be aware of the criteria here.The UK government have said their yardstick for quarantining returnees is when a country has had more than 20 ACTIVE CASES per 100,000 population, on a 7-day rolling average for 7 days or more. That was leaked midweek, and confirmed by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on Radio 4 yesterday morning.Bit of a convoluted one that, but if you look at the figures for France or Spain, that's exactly what happened. It's occasionally a day or three longer, as they need to meet in the 'Covid Cabinet' (meets on a Wednesday), take that to full cabinet (meets the following day - Thursday), and then announce. In the case of Spain they did this at 9:00pm to close at midnight on the Saturday after the decision was made, and there was hell to pay about not giving enough notice. So for France, they announced it on Thursday evening for 4:00am this morning to give Brits a time to flee.Okay, so where's Greece?Greece's latest data is due out any minute now, but I'll give you yesterday's for now. Their active cases figure was 18.46. It's rising at between 1.0 and 1.7 each day, depending on how many new cases there are, and how many of those infected are deemed clear, or who die.The 7-day rolling average is currently 14.4.Greece looks like passing 20 MAYBE today, probably tomorrow, or on Monday if we're very lucky. Unless, of course, new cases plummet, and they've risen every day (on a 7-day rolling average) since 21st July, and are rising quite quickly.If the daily figure passes 20 on Sunday, the seven day average will pass 20 on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Greece will have been over 20 for 7 days a week after that, so that's 26th-28th August, with quarantine coming on the morning of Saturday 29th.If it's the 28th when the average figures passes 20 for the 7th day, it's not impossible there won't be a decision until the following Wednesday/Thursday (see above for the process), for quarantine from the early hours of Saturday 5th September. I think that's vert unlikely. At Covid Cabinet on Wednesday they'll know Greece had been over for 6 days, and that figures calculated on Thursday morning will take it past the limit. They'd be likely to recommend to cabinet to quarantine if, as expected, that's what happens.Of course, all of this is subject to change. The government might change its methodology, or boundaries. Greece might get a grip and start to bring the numbers down.Whilst possible, I doubt that's likely. Perhaps Greece's best hope is if figures stop rising so fast, and even level out. If the average over those 7 days bobbles along between 20 & 25, the government might wait and see.If anyone requires links for any of the above, please let me know.Any questions, please ask.Edited: 5:36 am, August 15, 2020 "

Do you know when they are released and where to see them? Thanks.
Hi All. Such useful information. Thank you. We are in Greece currently and due to fly home next Saturday-22nd. We very much need to avoid a quarantine that would mean missing the start of the school year. We either stay until the 22nd or try to take the flight home on Wednesday instead. Any thoughts?
"#233, you're looking at the wrong figures.The key figure is not 'Cases' in Column E, it's 'Cumulative...' in Column L.Even then, it's a very slightly different count to what's being used, but close enough.If you look just at new cases for France, it's nowhere near 20/100,000, which is what GS spoke about on the Today programme yesterday morning.Read this:https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…""“Anything above 20 per 100,000 for a period of seven days or more is likely to lead to that country being added to the quarantine list.”GS confirmed, saying:""With France and these other countries, Netherlands and elsewhere, the numbers have now just gone above the threshold, which is about 20 cases per 100,000, but measured on a seven-day rolling average,”https:/…c01b59c3-9d6a-492f-9937-560fd4c7b7f9Edited: 11:34 am, August 15, 2020 "
"Right, one more for now. When the government are saying things, they’re pretty clear, but it’s not 100%.However, I’m working on the presumption that it’s the 7-day rolling average taken each day, and that figure being over 20/100,000 for two reasons.1 - It’s the only thing that fits in with all the different things they’ve said/leaked.2 - It fits pretty perfectly with what happened to France and Spain. In both cases, if you just go on when they’re 7-day average went over, that was ages before the U.K. pulled the plug. If you just go in when they’d been over 20 raw figures for 7 days, same again. But if you go in the 7- day average being over for 7 days, that fits exactly with when we quarantined."

As all children are returning to school after a significant time off for many then I think it would be awful for them to miss the start of term. All that reintroduction to learning and socialisation and that feeling of all being in it together is vital to children this September. My view is not to take chances!
"Poster 236 has probably already decided what to do.Difficult but I would have chosen to do nothing based on all the information floating around at the moment.I am still vaguely hoping to travel next month.The kids going back to school bit doesn't concern me now but must admit that I would never have considered ours not being there at the start of a new school year. However, these are not normal times.In the big scheme of things does it matter?"
Yes it really does matter at this point in my opinion
"#239, that’s fairly static at the moment.I’m out at the moment, and can’t access all figures on my phone. I’ll post more tomorrow."
"As a headteacher of a school I always put the the interests if the children first but obviously you think different from your experience. I'm talking from nearly 30 years experience of mine and witnessing the impact on children.Edited: 4:14 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"I think with the potential to mess up kids going back to school they may shift it to the end of bank holiday weekend and possible to 1st September. However we will need to be seeing some days with 300 or more this week coming for it to be likely to be that weekend. If not then it will be the week after, 5th September."
"#246, I’ve worked in secondary schools for 26 years - Head of Year, Head of Department, Head of School.I’ve seen numerous kids return a week or two late. I believe it only causes damage where the child is also off a lot at other times.Good, committed kids with supportive parents are fine."
"May I just point out that pupils have already missed a huge chunk of their schooling this year which far outstrips cumulative totals for usual absences. The provision during the last few months has not been of a uniform standard across the piece ( which implies no criticism). I agree that ( on the whole and in normal circumstances) good, committed pupils with supportive parents largely do well. Good, committed pupils where that is not case do less well."
"~239, when the ECDC figures appear later this morning, the new cases will figure will be reduced from 230 to 226.Small change, but at least it's down.On the bigger picture, I think all round it'd be good if the good people of Greece see these figures slow, and even reduce.This is just me, but if I were in the Greek government, I'd be looking at it this way. The main season ends with the week commencing 28th September. That's only 6 weeks away. The last week is usually very quiet, so it wouldn't be the biggest disaster to lose that. If you just count people going for the fortnight before that, they'll be arriving on the 12th, which is only 4 weeks away. I'd be doing everything I could to massage the figures down a little."
"Great point YorkshireMouth, also if our Govt think logically about it and the impact of people having to self isolate and not going to work, would it really impact that much to take Greece off the list when we are a matter of weeks away from the end of the season and like you say, it gets quieter the more you get into September I guess on the flip side, some of the other Greek islands go into October, so that may mean they do enforce it"
"Today’s 14 day figures up slightly from 20.1 to 21.2, not sure what the 7 day figure is, am hoping Greece falls below 20 in next couple of days or fear quarantine in the next week on return."
"The 7 day rolling average is pretty easy to calculate - take the last 7 days, add together, divide by 7.Yesterday it was 15.78, today it's 17.13, so still under 20. At that rate of increase it'll be 18.48 tomorrow, 19.83 on Tuesday, and over 20 on Wednesday. Of course, slightly higher numbers in the next two days might tip it past 20 on Tuesday.Leaving that aside, and just looking at raw figures, Greece is still a way behind France.Go to the link below. Enter Greece & France in the search box for countries. Then select cases instead of deaths, and new instead of cumulative.Then click on 'More options' and select per million instead of raw numbers and linear instead of logarithmic.You can see that Greece on the 14th is where France was on the 4th. If you want to check back to when Spain was quarantined you'll see something similar.However, switch to logarithmic view and you'll see Greece's figures are acceleration rapidly.https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/…In all fairness, Greece should NOT be quarantined this week, but who knows if they get cold feet.I'll not feel safe (I'm going a week today) until we start to see in the press what's bring discussed at Covid Cabinet on Wednesday, and then if there are leaks as to what they've recommended to the full cabinet on Thursday.Edited: 6:50 am, August 16, 2020 "
Thanks Yorkshiremouth you’re a mine of information
"One little day of light, the 7 day averahe for new cases is slowing. At one point it was doubling every 5 days. More recently that's increased to once every 7 days. From 8th to 15th it went up from 119 to 206, so less than double.Indeed it was on 103 (50% of 206) on 6th August, so it's taking 9 days to double.The Daily Mail clearly don't know what they're talking about. Latest story:""It has soared past the benchmark of 20 Covid cases per 100,000 people ""They're looking at new cases rather than active cases.Well done everyone. You're better informed than a Daily Mail reporter. But then again, you knew that anyway."
"@yorkshireMouth When you talk about quarantine do you mean people will need to go onto quarantine for 2 weeks when they get back home or that Greece will go into another lockdown? I'm due to fly out to Chania on the 31st and fully prepared to quarantine when I get back but I am starting to get worried about everything shutting in Crete in the meantime or not being able to get back to Ireland?!Edited: 7:52 am, August 16, 2020 "
"Yes, that's exactly what I mean.The government do appear to have been stung by criticism of how it handled Spain, when it announced 14 day quarantine for returnees in a Tweet at 9:00pm on Friday night to start 3 hours later at midnight. This time they announced it on Thursday evening for 4:00am on Saturday morning, and a lot of people clearly rushed home just in time.I can't think of a good reason they'd change back if & when Greece is out on the list.Actually, checking back, Spain were a day later (midnight Saturday night, not Friday). I've no idea why.Still, logic and reason are not always strong bedfellows with politicians, and I could imagine going to bed on Saturday, expecting to be flying off on Sunday, and waking Sunday morning to find the rug had been pulled.I shall not sleep well.Edited: 8:18 am, August 16, 2020 "
"I can't read behind the Telegraph's paywall, but the headline looks interesting.https:/…"
A different take from the excellent statistical commentary:https:/…the-dangerous-sophistries-of-mykonos
"A very interesting read, thanks. We`re are due to travel on Friday so I`m watching this thread with a great deal of interest. We have already decided that we are going regardless of FCO advice (or the 14-day house arrest measure on return) but Tui will pull the holiday if the measures are imposed before we fly so I will need a bit of time to book a new holiday using Ryan Air or Easyjet and the hotel through TA. We will have to use one of the specialist travel insurance companies that insure regardless of FCO advice. I got a quote for £91.40 for 2 weeks in Spain and Portugal for both of us so if it`s the same price for Greece (if they are removed from the safelist) then it`s not that bad really......"

"#259: Telegraph won’t like me doing this...“Boris Johnson is being urged by ministers not to add any more countries to the quarantine list in order to save what is left of the summer holidays.There are fears that if Greece joined France and Spain on the list it would collapse the ""travel corridor"" system that has given overseas holidays to hundreds of thousands of Britons during the pandemic.The status of Greece was uncertain on Saturday with one Cabinet minister saying that ""it all depends on the numbers"". Transport secretary Grant Shapps will review its figures on Thursday.Ministers are privately now hoping that the position will not be clear cut enough to force a decision before the end of this month to avoid ruining holidays for tens of thousands of Britons.One minister said: ""We should be wary of doing this too precipitately - I do think that the evidence in France seems clearer cut. I hope that they don't. If we have made a decision to allow people to have holidays then we do need to stand by it.""If we can just get through the next fortnight then you are through the bulk of the holiday season. If we remove Greece as well you have to start questioning whether we are leaving the bridges intact.""Friends of Grant Shapps, the Transport secretary who will rubber stamp any changes, pointed out that Belgium took two weeks before it was added to the list and the situation improved in Croatia without any action having to be taken.”However positively you read this, ultimately the decision will be made on the numbers/rate and not on someone ‘urging’ Boris Johnson to delay by a week or two.We are due to fly to Corfu on Thursday and probably not going to risk it.Edited: 8:46 am, August 16, 2020 "
"Thanks everyone.A few things to note.The Telegraph has been called ""...a mouthpiece for Boris Johnson...""And for ""...friends of Grant Shapps.."", in political journalism that's code for 'Grant Shapps'.It's certainly true to say that, unless there's an explosion of cases in the next 3 days, the situation on Thursday will be FAR less clear-cut than it was for France this Thursday.For context - last Sunday France's figure was 26, compared to Greece's 21.2. France had been >20 for 6 days (and on 19-odd for 4 days before). Greece has only been above 20 for 2. France's 7-day rolling average had been >20 for 5 days, Greece's is still < 20.Based on the numbers/rate, Greece are not as bad as France were a week ago, and it look like, if there's a borderline decision, the other factors are going their wayNothing certain, but a lot of hope for optimism, I feel."
It’s also worth bearing in mind that there would have been hundreds of families with school children that went away on holiday to Greece for two weeks this weekend. They won’t be returning home until the 29th/30th August. If they then have to quarantine for two weeks that’s an awful lot of children missing school. There would be school teachers too unable to return to work which would cause even more problems. The Government will be fully aware of this. I think that’s why this weekend was the cut off point for France as they know the quarantine period would be up before school returns. I think they’ll be doing all they can now to hold off until September and the school year has restarted.
"Now that is a very good point, and one of which I'd not thought.By the way, I don't return to work (in a school) until 7th September."
"If the cases per day are slowing, even slightly, and that continues, surely we won’t be looking at a quarantine situation. It’s has previously been said on one of these posts, you would need to be looking at around 305 new cases per day for 7 days to be over the threshold. Have the latest figures for today been released yet?"
"From 1 5/8/2020 at 14:00 to 1 6/8/2020 at 14:00The Coordinating Body of the Region of Thessaly for the response to the crisis of Covid 19, informs daily and with full validity the communities in the four Thessalian Prefectures about the evolution of the disease in existing and new outbreaks. The data of the new cases are drawn from the KOMY of EODY as well as from public and private laboratories in which the relevant controls are carried out. The information is based on the information of the Thessalian society and the protection of personal data and the reputation of people who are ill.-In the area of ​​Larissa2 new cases of Covid '19 were recorded. 2 cases live in another geographical Region and were diagnosed in the PGNL after symptoms while 1 more is considered ""orphan"". -In the area of ​​Karditsa3 new cases of Covid '19 were recorded. 1 case is a close contact of an older case while the other 2 are considered ""orphans"".- In the area of ​​Skiathos1 new case of Covid '19 was recorded.

"Quality posting Yorkshiremouth. There is a lot bad information in these forums but you are one of a small few who are consistently putting the facts out here. Hats off to you. We flew to Kos this morning from Manchester - PLF code 4,not tested. We fly back on the 30th and my kids go back to school on Wed 2nd Sept. I'm not concerned about quarantine (don't believe the 7 day moving average will reach the point where the UK govt will take this step until first week in Sept, if at all) and I'm even less worried about Covid itself."
* ‘orphan’ - cases not linked to travel or other known cases.
Is this the first case of Coronavirus in Skiathos other than ones diagnosed from testing at the gate?
"#26, many thanks, that's very kind of you.I have posted the information on several Skiathos-related forums and groups, as I hoped people would find it helpful, and most people are either appreciative, or those who are not interested have scrolled on by.But some on the 'I heart Skithos' FaceBook group think it's 'political' or 'scaremongering'. I've often been told not to argue with idiots, because they pull you down to their level, so I've just left the group."
I assume so if we take the definition of ‘orphan’ as defined.
"Sorry, that was quite self explanatory!"
"Per Worldometers, at 15/8 the 7 day moving average of cases is 206. In a population of 10.4m makes the 7 day average per 100k equal to 19.8 so dangerously close to 20."
That is incorrect.
217 cases in today’s figures...
"Hi, I'm on the Wordometers Greece page.Which numbers are you using?How are you calculating that?I'm going off the ECDC link, as provided at the bottom of this story, but I'd be interested to hear how you've come up with that figure - I may have missed something."
#277 hmm yes I agree I am in error! So what exactly is the UK govt measuring that has to be below 20?
"What I've been working on this this:https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-d…Then go to the last column, add together the last 7 days, then divide by 7. That gives you the 7-day rolling average.When that average is over 20 for 7 days, that's when it clicks in.If you look at France, that appears to work. France went over last Tuesday, Covid cabinet Wednesday, Full cabinet decision Thursday, announced on Thursday night they were closing 4:00am Saturday morning.But I'm very happy to be shown how I'm in error."
"I put this on another forum for yesterdays figures. I hope I am not wrong in the way I have calculated but there for all to see and apologise if my idea is wrongCases reported in Greece to make 7 day average from the covid worldometer9th Aug 202,10th Aug 126,11th Aug 193,12th Aug 235,13th Aug 204,14th Aug 251,15th Aug 226= total 1437104.1 (number of 100,000's people in the population of Greece)so 1437 / 104.17 = 13.79 as the rolling averageIt is clear to see if numbers keep going up and those small figures of the 9th and 10th of August are replace by much larger figures that rolling average is going to rise.But as previously said that if the 20.0 rolling average is the key to quarantine then the cases will need to rise to 300 before it is reached.but could easily happen if the rises continuestoday 217 new cases and the bottom one of 202 drops off, so little different to the total now standing at 13.9 for the weekEdited: 12:37 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"#279 Well, my bad I've made a basic error here, but admit I've now got myself confused as to what I want to measure! On the Worldometers Greece page look at the daily new cases chart, and then click on the 7 day moving average check box. The latest number on the subsequent blue line there is 206. As I'd seen lots of talk about the 7 day average inching towards 20 per 100K I dumbly just thought if there's a 10.423M population then the answer must be 206/something and so I got to my 19.8. But as my fellow poster quite rightly pointed out that is wrong. However, I'm left not understanding how the latest (close to 20) number touted about has been arrived at. Come on you maths bods out there, help and aged idiot out here!"
your 206 is correct for the daily average over that week
Ah Magic624422 do you agree with DelboyAylesbury's calculation?

"By the way, population is Greece is 10.7 million.Again, as per the spreadsheet."
Yes I agree it is very confusing and I’m no maths buff so relying on other in here to inform and educate me.Delboy and Yorkshire mouth seem to have its sussed. Agreed that the rolling average will rise in the coming days but if the cases per day doesn’t increase too much then I don’t think we have too much to worry about regarding quarantine. But I suppose it could go either way.
"#287 Not according to Worldometers ""The current population of Greece is 10,416,565 as of Saturday, August 15, 2020"""

"#292 No worries, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of how this magic 20 number is calculated and I agree we must use whatever population number UK govt is using (even if its wrong!). However the Worldometers calc must, I assume, be using the Worldometers own view of popualtion"
This spreadsheet.https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-d…I think they’re going on a 7-day rolling average of the figure in Column L.
It would make more sense if new cases are used as Countries can see which direction the virus is moving and by what numbers

#297 Did I miss some subtle nuance in my earlier post #268?
"My calculations give me a 7 days cumulative covid-19 cases per 100.000 of 13.93.Note that ECDC uses a 14 days and there is a significant difference between 7 and 14. For example, 2 days ago Poland’s 14 days was 24.9 while the 7 days one was 13.3. The UK Government seems to use the 7 days one as otherwise there are multiple other countries over 20 which are not on the quarantine list"
"#302 Radu, how do you calculate that please?"
"It is the same figure as in post 282 Nigel but as said, I stand corrected if wrong."
@299 witchhazel4Have they?https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-863…
"#304 OK yes I see that, BUT that calculation is based only on NEW infections. I'm interested ONLY in finding out how the UK govt calculates its critical number so I can track that. My calculation was based on all active infections. So, does anyone know how the UK govt works out its number? (Although looking at the A Level exam debacle the govt could be doing anything!)"
"I add up all new infections in the past 7 days (this latest total is 1,452) then divide by population (10,724,599 according to the ECDC spreadsheet) and then multiply by 100,000. This gives the current figure of 13.5, but I see that others have different ways of calculating it and get different results.What matters is how the UK govt calculates this, they don't reveal the numbers they are going off and there's seemingly no reliable source to confirm how this number is calculated by the UK govt."
I didn't article search the website but that article was prominently displayed this morning and wasn't on the site as you scroll down it when I posted.
#307 noted thank you. But what is the he logic for using new infections only?
"Yes, that is also the way I calculate it as well, but I use the easier way of taking the rolling 7 day average and multiplying by 7 rather than finding the 7 separate figures and adding them. My estimate of the population comes from worldometer and may be slightly different but it's in the same ballpark. The 7 day figure is definitely less than 14 now, and the 14 day figure just above 20. What matters is that in future weeks the daily average stays below 300 new cases. 300 a day over 7 days would mean a 7 day rate of more or less 20."
@Nigel: total number of new cases over the last 7 days/population*100.000. I don’t think using active cases it’s a good idea because we don’t know which ones are active/recovered/deceased. Some countries require 2 negative tests before they declare a case recovered but in UK we just assume that they are recovered after 14 days.
"The slight difference you have is the population difference from different sources. I saw that figure as year 2019 of 10,724,599"
@BenkersBen on Twitter seems to think the 7 day average is the one to watch and that newspapers are deliberately conflating it with the 14 day figure for clickbait.
"#313 Noted, but I'm just trying to understand how the UK govt calculates the 7 day number"
"I asked him and he says 'The 7-day cumulative figure per 100,000 people is calculated using cases from August 10th to August 16th.' So that is new cases. He has that at 13.6."
"Does anyone know if the governments calculations consider the number of tests conducted? So Greece randomly testing at airport will inevitably find cases they wouldn’t have found (asymptomatic) if they weren’t doing that. The U.K. is testing around 150,000 people a day (give or take a bit given the dodgy stats that come from the U.K.) and they are even randomly testing the public to find out the current prevalence, so again will find cases that would ordinarily have gone under the radar. Likewise, countries without good healthcare infrastructure won’t be testing anywhere near as much as somewhere with a good healthcare infrastructure. Surely the more testing the more cases that will be found. I do wonder if this is a factor involved in the governments calculations."
"#316 Emma, re your last part, you believe our govt capable of thinking? I give you A Level results as evidence. This lot are so incompetent it is frightening."
"Family and I were due to fly to Athens on Friday 21st and return late Saturday 29th. We where heading down to the Southern Peloponnese.Because of the risk of quarantine we have decided to cancel the trip.We have taken vouchers for the flights, and the accommodation is free cancellation. The car hire is also fully refundable. I couldn’t wait any more days to see the lie of the land as cancellation/change fees would have crept in.So, managed cancel without it costing us much (just emotional energy). I’d set it up that way because I knew the trip carried risk, so wanted to make sure the flights were rebookable for free, and everything else had free cancellation.Shame."
"@ witchhazel4, As per an Independent article prior to last week French quarantine, Public Health England carefully watch one particular statistic the cumulative number,over seven days, of covid 19 cases per 100000 of population so you could well be correct ."
"@Nigel B.I know you're trying to identify exactly how the UK govt are calculating the magic 20 number but Yorkshiremouth and several others on other Greek subforums on here have used their basis to arrive at the same calculations for Spain and France which match pretty perfectly with actual UK govt decisions, announcements and actions. Nobody knows the govt's precise methodology but the best assessments on here revert back to what happened with Spain and France. If a consistent method of calculation fits with govt action on those two countries and then is applied to Greece that's good enough for me."
"#320 yes noted how Yorkshiremouth arrives at his number but even he doubts his own method! He queries the significance of all infections v new infections. Look, I'm not trying to be difficult or deliberately argumentative, I'm just trying to understand the calculation so I can monitor."
@Emma: UK reports tests and not number of people tested. Some people might have 2-3 tests done in 24h in there is a high clinical suspicion of covid. And I don’t think testing increases the number of cases. Trump said the same about 2 months ago and surprise: after a bit of lag the number of patients in ITU went up by 25% and deaths went up to levels registered in June...I was looking at UK data about a week ago and from the lowest number of daily new cases (7 day average) on the 10th of July our testing went up by 11.40%. In the same time our daily new cases (7 days average) went up by 50.72%.
"Emma not sure if this will give you some idea but i was following the Spanish cases as i had a Barcelona holiday booked and they counted all Catalonia cases even though 60% were actually asymptomatic. They tested massively,and still are and almost 2/3 have no symptoms at all (average age of 40 too) but restrictions are still advised given they are all infectious to those vulnerableSpanish cases now are currently above the number of cases they had when they enforced their full strict lockdown"
"It's a complete mess, isn't it.This morning the Metro is saying Greece in trouble and Croatia on the brink at 21.So I've had a look on the spreadsheet . There are two ways I can get 21 for Croatia.I can add the last 7 days new cases up (column E) and divide by 40.76 (Croatia's population /100,000). That gets 21.5.Or add the last 14 days of Column L and divide by 14. That nets 21.6.But let's try that with Greece. The last 7 days from E add up to 1,437, divided by 107 (Greece's population /100,00) is 13.4. That's nowhere close to 20. Add the last 14 of column L and divide by 14 gets 12.9.Why would anyone be getting in a flap about that?So I've worked it backwards. 20 x 107 = 2,140. Divide by 7 is 306. If that's the figure they're looking at, then Greece would have to have 7 days averaging 300 a day. but they've only been over 250 once, and the average per day over the last 7 days is 13.4.If that's what it is, then confusion is caused by the papers banging on about something impossible. As Greece hasn't gone over 305 yet, they're AT LEAST 7 days away from quarantine, unless they got numbers massively over 300 during the next week (one of the day's figures is 126, and you'd need 484 to counterbalance that in the average.So why would there be stories of the government quarantining at this weeks cabinets on Wednesday & Thursday?"
"@Yorkshire: I think mass-media just look at some graphs and numbers and they don’t know how to interpret them. They just draw some conclusions without having any understanding of the data they see. “Ohhh, cases doubled in Greece, let’s throw this article”Edited: 4:49 am, August 17, 2020 "
"It sells newpapers. The schools will be going back shortly and the number of cases may rise because of it. There was talk of other things allowed to open having to take a compromise if the numbers go up in the UK. What measures to be taken are unknown but economy here in the UK is becoming more important. If that figure of 126 drops out and replace by a bigger figure today the average will again go up more. However, we are in the hands of what our Government decides at the end of the day"
"HOLD ON.Today's Telegraph rolling news (you can access this - it's not behind a paywall.https:/…It says ""Greece is now at 21.2, after crossing the 20 threshold on Saturday.""Look at the spreadsheet, Column L - the one I've been working on. Sure enough, it just sneaked over 20 on Saturday, and was 21.2 yesterday. Again, I have no idea how that's calculated, nor does it particularly matter at this stage. **So, if the Telegraph have it right, that's the one to watch. If the numbers in Greece don't fall, it'll have had 7 days above on Friday.However, if we use that figure, France had been above that number for 10 days when they announced lockdown on Thursday, and that's also true of Spain. The only two explanations are (a) they wanted to give France & Spain a bit more time, OR (b) they're going on what the figures are at the cabinet meetings on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and both France & Spain were below the previous week.Either way, it looks like the plug will be pulled, not this week, but next week, with the decisions taken at the meetings on Wednesday & Thursday, announced on Thursday night, for quarantine on Saturday morning. If they were to wait for Friday's figures then quarantine immediately, that'd be treating Greece differently to Spain & France. So it should be a week on Saturday.Which is where I think I came in a couple of pages ago.You know that curse, ""May you live in interesting times""...** They also say ""Croatia is at 29 – the fifth consecutive day that it has exceeded 20 cases per 100,000.""

Lots of media outlets gets their data from ECDC where the 14 days value it is indeed 21.2. But there’s a significant difference between 14 and 7 days and there are countries on ECDC list with values over 20 for a while. https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea

"#335 That's what I'd calculated, too, IF you just use daily new cases.For it to go over 20 it'd have to average 305 a day. Greece are heading that way, but they're a long way off yet.The truth is, different papers are using different criteria. Some are looking at the last 7 days new cases, adding, then dividing by 7. That doesn't work if you look at cases in new cases in France leading up to them being quarantined, though.I've tried all the calculations, and the only thing that appears to work is Column L >20 for 7 days, then go to the next Wednesday & Thursday's cabinets to decide on quarantine that weekend.I can't see anything else that 'works' with the figure of 20.Why are the government going on 7 day, and the published figures are 14 day? I've half a mind that it's Column L, averaged for each day for the last 7 days, then THAT 7-DAY AVERAGE has to be >20 for 7 days.That has France tipping over on Wednesday 5th, the 7th day being Wednesday 12th, and bingo. That's what I've worked at from the start (my original post).Again, Greece is a bit off yet. Currently 17.1, over 20 by Wednesday or so, then going at next Wednesday's cabinet.Either way that's when it's looking, unless things slow down.But then again, we've had 2 falls in 2 days, so who knows.Next data out soon."
@336: For France the number will be bellow 20 because for a while they’ve stopped reporting over the weekend so you have less cases if you add 0 for Sat or Sun. For any other country who was recently added on the list the 7 days per 100.000 is over 20 based on my calculations.
Spain on the 26th?
@YorkshireMouth It is the 7 day rolling average that is being used. Not the 7 day average. Use that and it will add up to the 13.x number.
"YorkshireMouth the column L you refer to is the 14 day figure and not the 7 day figure, also the column itself is labelled as such (Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID-19_cases_per_100000). There's still a lot of confusion over the 7 and 14 day figures amongst people and the media. For example on that Telegraph rolling news story published this morning, if you scroll down further to the story posted at 10:29am - Mapped: the safest places in Europe, it shows an outdated map of data collected from July 27 - August 9 - this is already over 7 days behind the latest numbers so is completely pointless as to the current situation. And not only that, the graph is based on the 14-day data which is not the same as the 7-day data confirmed to be what the govt use. Yesterday, the same telegraph had the number at 13.5 which is the actual 7-day figure.I would not have much confidence going off newspaper stories and sensationalist headlines as they all seem to have their numbers confused, and would rather focus on the daily reported cases and calculate the 7 day rolling average impartially. I'd only trust the news if it's been confirmed by a govt source."
"So, how are you calculating that?The day after France locked down Grant Shapps said:“With France and these other countries, Netherlands and elsewhere, the numbers have now just gone above the threshold, which is about 20 cases per 100,000, but measured on a seven-day rolling average,”So looking at the Netherlands. 7 days up to 13th August total 4191, divided by 173 (population is 17.3 million) = 24.22.France, the 7 days without a zero figure total 15,401, /670 = 23.But if you do that with Greece - last 7 days to yesterday total 1,437 /107 = 13.4. That's quite a long way off.And, as I say, try a little reverse maths. 107 x 20 = 2,140 /7 = 305.7.Greece would have to have figures of 305 a day (on average) for 7 days, and they've only been over 250 once, and have come down the 2 days since then.Now that's worth keeping an eye on, but the chances of the average going over 605 a day by Wednesday's cabinet are next to zero, and I'm not sure it's particularly likely for the following week.The 7-day rolling average for last week is 207. To go up to 305, that's a 50% increase, give or take. On countback, 66% of that takes us to 9th August, so 8 days ago. So the 7-day average would be 305 by Sunday 23rd, unless they felt an emergency meeting was called, again the decision would be made Wednesday/Thursday and quarantined on the 29th.You see, however you add it up, it comes down to the same date."
"Yes, the 13.x figure are what most of us are getting when doing the 7 day rolling calculation, and for this to become over 20 then the daily number of new cases must go over 300 consistently.Regarding whether that will be reached next week and whether quarantine will be on the 29th is, at the moment, a big IF - and this is based on how the figures play out over the next few days. Essentially, if the daily cases start to go over 300 then yes we are looking at a good chance the govt will step in to take measures and set a quarantine date. If the numbers being reported remain below 300, then we will not have reached the 20/100k 7 day figure yet."
"If it's true that they're adding the 7 last 7 days, then dividing that by 107, Greece's figures have just risen very slightly to 13.57 from 13.43.Column L figure has risen to 22.5.However, Shapps was clear it was on a 7-day average. So that's an average of those figures.So, for each day add the last 7 days, divide by 107. Then USING THAT FIGURE, work out the average for the last 7 days.I'll work that out."
"Right, that average has it going up from 10.3 to 11.1.Still quite a way off.Whichever way you add it up, I still think I'm going on Sunday, but still quite probably being quarantined on return, unless the government ease up.Edited: 6:58 am, August 17, 2020 "
"342 says it in a nutshell: ""Essentially, if the daily cases start to go over 300 then yes we are looking at a good chance the govt will step in to take measures and set a quarantine date. If the numbers being reported remain below 300, then we will not have reached the 20/100k 7 day figure yet."" That's all that really matters, how many new cases there are every day and whether they carry on increasing like they have in the last few weeks."
"The rate if increase has slowed.The last 3 days (7-day rolling average) has been 194, 206, 207.The raw figures have been 251, 226, 217.Now of course, that could jump very quickly. But even if it just evened off at around 250 it'd stay under the 20/100,000 figure.And, for most of us, it only needs to hold off for a few more weeks. Last fortnight of the season starts in 5 weeks."
"Following this thread is more interesting than the book I'm reading on the beach (Flash Boys by Michael Lewis). I'm pretty sure of the maths being used to get to 13 now and 300 per day to trigger quarantine from the 29th. It affects me because, even though I'm here and not due to fly back until the 30th, I must avoid quarantine so I'd have to dash back to get under the 4am Saturday 29th deadline. My hope/belief is that even if the 300 is reached and the 20 number based on a 7 day rolling average is reached before the cabinet meeting next Wednesday (ie 26th),the government will delay the quarantine until after Bank Holiday and maybe even until schools go back on the 2nd. I'm prepared for a mad dash back to England on the 28th though (at vast expense).Edited: 7:35 am, August 17, 2020 "
Does anyone know when an announcement is likely to be made if there was to be quarantine from 4am Saturday? Thursday night? I am due to fly home Saturday morning but also have a back up flight booked on Friday as cannot quarantine. When would I know what’s happening this weekend? Thanks all.
"Yes, a lot of UK travellers would have timed our holiday to return around the summer bank holiday weekend - whether those looking to make it back in time for schools reopening, or those who aren't affected by schools reopening but still taking advantage of the bank holiday weekend for a longer break. It would spark mayhem once again should quarantine be set for 4:00am on the 29th August like they did for France/Netherlands/Malta. We've seen reports urging the government to avoid this and to wait til at least September so the majority of people getting back during the summer bank holiday weekend will still be able to return via their already arranged flights.The next few days will be key. We're all hoping for the figures to be in the low or ideally sub-200's to counter balance any spikes that may come closer to the cabinet meeting date, so as to keep the average below 20. We will find out today's figure in around 4 hours. The number of new cases last Monday was 126 and this will be replaced by what is released today. So for the current rate of 13.5 to drop then today's figure will need to be lower than 126, if it's higher than the rate of 13.5 will increase. Here are some projected figures in anticipation of today's number:If today's announced number is 200, the rate will climb to 14.2If today's announced number is 225, the rate will climb to 14.5If today's announced number is 250, the rate will climb to 14.7If today's announced number is 275, the rate will climb to 14.9If today's announced number is 300, the rate will climb to 15.2"
"If the figures do peak over 300 consistently, I don’t think quarantine will be an issue if both TUi and jet2 react the same as they did with Spain and suspend flights to Greece"
It's the getting home part that's the issue for most I think. Avoiding quarantine on the way back.
"David, they’ll be an issue for people who are there."
"@ThisPlus87Very useful thank you.Edited: 8:13 am, August 17, 2020 "
"Announcement will most likely be Thursday evening if they’re quarantining.HOWEVER, if they’re not doing so (as most of us suspect), it may well be there’ll be a leak on Wednesday to ease minds."
"Croatia will be interesting.The last 5 days (average of the previous 7 / 40 , which is Croatia's population/100,000) have been:12.416.119.821.924.2That''s an average of 18.8.If, as you'd expect, we get figures today and tomorrow of over 23, then we'd be in a situation where Croatia had been over 20 for 4 days, but the average of the last 7 days would be over 20.What the government does then might affect Greece the following week, or week after - a signal as to whether they're giving any leeway. Whatever they decide, I suspect they'll have to say at some point what their rationale was for their decision, given that it's so tight."

"The biggest cause of confusion is the press saying how Greece is teetering on the brink, when they're clearly not."

@ThisPlus87That is a very positive bit of info.
@Iggu - indeed!Tomorrow's figure will replace the 193 recorded last Tuesday 11th August. So as long as tomorrow's figure is below 193 then the rate of 13.8 will go down.Fingers crossed
"Today adjusted to 147.That’s the third consecutive day it’s fallen, and it’s less than half the 305 benchmark."
Just saw the worldometers figure too - 147Going by this number to calculate the rate of infection it actually comes back with 13.7 per 100k
"the figure 147 today will be the low Sunday figure and replace the 126, so still going up"
"Just a thought.On Friday it was 251. Since then it's fallen by 104.Had it risen by 104 to 355, and continued with something larger on Tuesday and Wednesday, I'm not sure Greece wouldn't be quarantined this week.Even if the figures would possibly not be technically over the benchmark, that's not written in stone.Id certainly be sweating."
"Yes, still going up by the law of rolling averages but a third consecutive day the number has reduced. Hugely positive news. I hope for you all and the Greeks that you get your holiday (and that I don't have to cut mine short). The Greeks certainly want us here, that's for sure."
"I've just done the sums.Imagine:204251 - Now imagine the numbers had gone up instead of down...276285355380400That's 7 days/107 = 20.1.The Covid group on Wednesday might decide to go to cabinet on Thursday, saying if the numbers go up again overnight, pull the plug.We really were that close."
IMO a pointless post
"Greece as a whole would have to reach 300 new cases per day for 7 days to reach 20.16. As the cases have fallen for the last 2 days and the rate per 100,000 stands at 13.8, I’m sure it’s headed in the right direction."
"Todays figures:‘Today we are announcing 150 new cases of the new virus in the country, 17 of which have been detected following checks at the country's entry gates. The total number of cases is 7222, of which 55.2% are for men.‘"
"I am really worried flying out this saturday coming back late following saturday, easyjet and tour operator are not cancelling holidays for quarantine and option to rebook is to pay a ridiculous amount of money on top of the ridiculous amount of money we have already paid for a holiday in August and if we don’t go we lose all the money, plus children will be very upset about the holiday they have been waiting to go on since January when we booked i am hoping that the figures do go down as quarantine is going to cause a lot of problems work/school etc"
"By the way, the reporter bird from Brussels on Sky News dropped the Greece word, on the news earlier. Obviously found a newspaper from last week, mentioning the early closures in certain parts of Greece. Probably she holidays in the Maldives and thinks Greece is the same size and it applies everywhere ..."
"Thanks for everyone’s contribution on here - it’s very informative! We are flying out to Crete early Friday morning. I’ve thought about moving the holiday but tbh as there are six of us, Jet2 would charge us £900 for the privilege and the same holiday next year is an additional £3k! So we are going to risk it. We unfortunately fly back on the following Saturday so there is a chance of quarantine - but I will deal with that as and when I need to!"
"Hi everyone, today a young lady from Rome has been tested positive at the airport after she’s been to Skiathos. Im in Skiathos now and im very worried, even because nobody seem to take the covid situation seriously here (a lady at a bar near the port joked on me wearing a mask yesterday). Does anyone have news about tests here? are people being tested?"
"I think we all made a very simple mistake when calculating the cumulative 7 days rolling average per 100.000. I say this because I think we have to use 7 values which are also 7 day averages. For example, let’s say that the 7 day average one day 1 is X1 on day 2 is X2 and so on.You will then have (X1+....X7)/population*100.000Without today’s data this would leave Greece at 12.08.Please feel free to correct me if you have a different opinion as I am by no mean a statistics expert."
"To calculate the average for day 1, the 7-day moving average will average out the number of cases for the last seven days. In calculating for day 2, we will remove the first data point and add the value for the 8th day, to continue with the calculation of the moving average."
"Grasshopper. You will surely be as safe or at risk just the same in Crete or UK. Enjoy your holiday and try not to worry. Quarantine on the way back should not be a problem unless you have work or children to consider. Just take some extra time to unpack, unwind, download those Skiathos photos to TA and write up a few restaurant reviews for those who follow. SL - the doom and gloom exemplified by the newspaper and TV Channels, especially Sly News and BBC should be ignored. Their only slightly hidden agenda is to topple the Government. Fortunately most people can see through their BS.Kitty - as above. There are lots of people, businesses and organisations who see Covid as an opportunity to make money. Take the holiday that you have worked and saved for, the kids and you deserve a break. Don’t worry unduly about the potential of quarantine when you return, there seems few ways or means for such measures to be checked, least of all enforced."
"Lot of scaremongering in this thread from a few Karen’s. I’m going to Skiathos on Friday and can’t wait. The numbers are falling daily it’s a small island, with a small population and all the required measures are in place. If you want to talk numbers, you’re statistically safer in Skiathos than you are in UK. Make of that what you will."
Channel 4 News speculating that travellers to Croatia and Greece will be next to face quarantine. Looked like Koukounaries that they flashed up on the screen whilst talking about Greece!
Skiathos on its own is as relevant to the UK government's quarantine decision on Greece as Ibiza was to the decision on Spain. ie not at all relevant. You have to look at Greece as a whole.
"@Radu AAlthough mathematically that probably also makes sense, I've yet to see anybody quoting a recent figure of 12.x in any news. Yesterday a few news articles posted quotes of the figure being 13.4, today there's been a post on another thread addressing the incorrect figures quoted by the British media and has the number at 13.6 today. These have been much closer to what we've found when calculating the daily figures, so I'm more inclined to go with this over the other method.The link to that news is: https://kefaloniapulse.homeinkefalonia.prope…Edited: 2:49 pm, August 17, 2020 "
"@ThisPlus: my calculations were the same as those quoted in here too, I think I’ve posted some of them myself. But thinking further about it, had a moment of revelation and after further reading realised that I might have actually been wrong the whole time."
DW. You're spot on. Please post a few reviews. We'll be there 18 Sep for 2 weeks while the Karens are spreading doom and gloom.
@DW: people are just trying to make informed decisions as not everyone can quarantine 14 days on return. Pretty sure that people are more compliant with the rules in Greece comparing to UK so I would definitely feel safer in there than in my local supermarket where nobody seems to care anymore.
"I'm not sure, based on what I've seen so far here, that people in Greece are ""more compliant"". Eg masks worn as chin warmers (to tick the box) is just as common here as it is in England."
"thank you phillancs, we have spoke tonight and decided we are going and we are going to enjoy ourselves and not stress, what will be will be, and IF it happens we will just deal with it, there’s no point in worrying about something that’s completely out of my hands and may not even happen!"
Spot on!
"I second that. A lady running the Taz Mania bar / restaurant here in Skiathos laughed at us for wearing masks inside. None of the staff was wearing masks or gloves while handling food and drinks. Its like this in most of the places unfortunately, and im very worried since there is actually a person that contracted the virus here in the last days."
"From Kathimerini last night:‘The use of masks by all employees and customers at public services is mandatory, according to a circular issued by the Interior Ministry on Monday. Moreover, civil servants belonging to high-risk groups will have the option of working from home until August 31, according to the same circular. Health officials have intensified a campaign to convince citizens to wear masks in all public areas amid an upward trend in coronavirus infections.’"
“Carlo” is posting constantly that staff aren’t wearing masks.Everyone else appears to say they are.Comments?
"""Fears have also been raised about holidays in Greece, but with a case rate of 13.8 per 100,000 during the last week they appear safe for now. ""The telegraph sees sense and changes it's tone this morning.https:/…"
That's maybe because the Telegraph seems to have shifted to the looming apocalyptic war between Turkey and Greece. https:/…They're probably disappointed that Covid in Greece isn't going the way they'd hoped for their headlines so have switched to this. I'm expecting chinooks over the horizon at any moment. The media no longer offers news.
#390: Carlo is reporting what he has seen ...
@393 at last one paper is getting it right.The only problem is that we are all assuming that rolling av of 20.0 will remain the UK target. With the UK figures dropping the UK gov may wish to lower that figure at some point in time to stop it going up again.
"But it just seems completely at odds with what everyone else is saying.And it doesn't appear to be a one-off. Every post has been critical, from one before he even set off, through to Thessoloniki, to the buses (everywhere, not just Skiathos), the bar staff, and even the police.Even on the Italian-language forums people are asking if he's just making it up.I make no such judgement. Just that what he's saying is at odds with the other reports I'm reading.Of course, I'll decide for myself in just a few days time. I think, if I visit a bar or taverna, I may post a pic in a review.Best wishes."
"#394, they might, but I don't think the UK figures aren't particularly falling.They've gone down for the last 3 days, which is great. But that aside there's been a slow & steady rise, with the 7-day average increasing on an almost daily basis since 8th July. That's 37 days of rising and 3 days of falling. I wouldn't expect them to change anything until after the holiday season has ended and everyone's back at work/school.It'll be interesting to see,though."
"Who knows what he has experienced in his home country.If you have been touched by the virus, and its affected those near and dear, then you can understand why. There have been fines on Skiathos, when the police did spot checks of catering establishments."
"Didn't know that, about the fines.Good points, too. Look, we all know the restrictions aren't going to be adhered to the letter at all times. Anyone can slip up.But if I go in somewhere, and it's clear they're just slack, and not bothering, I'll leave.People who are clearly trying will have my custom."
"UK’s 7 days rolling average went up from 550 at the begging of July to 1080 yesterday. So the threshold might actually be increased instead of lowered given the fact that our cases are going up too. If I would be the one taking the decisions, I would set the threshold based on our number of new cases - anyone travelling from countries with lower prevalence than ours can do so without quarantine.Edited: 5:39 am, August 18, 2020 "

"#401, I'm still at a loss as to why our government, in the depths of the most significant crisis since the war, can't log data accurately on a weekend."
"I would guess lower numbers of staff on duty over the weekend to report figures in Homes, NHS, doctors and government offices."
"Today's figures will be interesting. We're all aware there's a lull in logging the numbers accurately over the weekend in the UK, though not sure whether the same applies in Greece."
well you can see the trend of reporting in all countries including Greece from the graphs. Hence the 126 was lower the previous Monday as probably this Monday's but only tonight's figures will tell
"#407 Having looked at the stats over the past couple of months, Greece doesn't appear to have any kind of consistent weekend lag.Indeed, the three most recent statistically atypical UPWARD peaks have been on a Tuesday, a Saturday and a Sunday.Because of the possibility of variation it's safest to check the 7-day average, and that's been:11th 15612th 171 (up 15)13th 181 (up 10)14th 194 (up 13)15th 206 (up 12)16th 207 (up 1)17th 210 (up 3)Between 30th July (41) and August 9th (138) it rose by 97 in 9 days, so almost 11 a day. Between 8th (138) and 17th (210) it's risen by 72 in 9 days, so just 8 a day.The last couple of days just 2 a day - again, all on a 7-day average rather than raw figures."
"Interesting stats, YorkshireMouth. Today's figures come out in around 4 hours, maybe wishful thinking but it would be great to see another drop to make it 4 consistent days in a row."
Monday's figures would be for Sunday so the lesser figure. One day it was an oil factory with about 50 cases and another day an Island with a lot of cases. So varies
"So I'm now not worrying whether I'm going on Sunday. My mind is turning to the possibility of quarantine on return.I'm there for 12 nights, coming back on Friday 5th, landing at around 10:00pm. If there's a midnight curfew and the flight is delayed, there could be a problem. But if it's announced for 4:00am Saturday (as with France) I'll be fine. That'sin quarantine were to be decided and announced on Thursday rd.So realistically, it'd have to be announced the week before on Thursday 27th. So the figures would have to average 306+ a day from 21st to 27th.The 21st is this Friday. So already that'll soon be upon us.Edited: 8:29 am, August 18, 2020 "
That is why I originally posted #282 in the first place. Hopefully you have some assurance now. Although none of us knows what our Government will decide but you have the odds in your favour
"Yorkshiremouth - I was in exactly the same boat a week ago. I think you'll be fine and I'd start looking forward to your holiday. The Greeks will welcome you with open arms. The most depressing part of all these discussions is when English people berate holidaymakers for ""infecting the Greeks"" or ""taking the virus to Greece"" or whatever. One of the main reasons I threw caution to the wind is that my neighbours are Greek and they were urging me to go on holiday and support local Greek economies who badly need to salvage something from this season. I was chatting to Nikos my pool guy this morning and he was saying if the season can just get through the next few weeks with no more cancellations or curfews then many families here will avoid a financial calamity. It feels on a knife edge. We're eating out every night and I'm tipping like a madman. It'll be interesting to see today's numbers but my fears of having to dash home before 4am on Sat 29th are diminishing fast... I'd start packing if I were you."
"I'm mainly done.My daughter started packing 3 weeks ago!I don't think there's been a point where I've been genuinely worried as such - no losing sleep, or becoming a nervous wreck. I'm a cautiously optimistic sort of chap, I suppose.I think the worst moment was last Friday's 251. I thought typical, it'll really take off just before I go. But now, I think half of Greece would have had to wandered round licking door handles for the last week or so for there to be a problem.Trust me, I'm going to thoroughly enjoy this one."
250 new cases today takes the 7 day figure up to 14.3
"That’s not good, after the drop......but then again it’s not bad, either. This is Tuesday and it’s one less than Friday.Still nowhere near the 306 required, either.It’ll be interesting to see tomorrow’s."
"a local paper is quoting 269 new cases, 2 deaths and gives all locations. You get these odd differences with worldometer which may later correct. If you want to see the breakdown it is on post 420 added by the Fin guy who has done it each day recently. On the 'covid update' on Crete forumEdited: 12:43 pm, August 18, 2020 "
https://kefaloniapulse.homeinkefalonia.prope…this article is saying that the media is wrong and greece isn’t at the 20 threshold and it’s at 13.6 if that’s the case even with today’s higher number it’s not going to reach the 20
"Yes there's often a discrepancy between the local news and what's posted on worldometer, though the official ECDC stats seem to correlate more with worldometer. Even if using the 269 number for today instead of the 250 it makes a small increase to 14.4.The signs are that Greece should be fine this week. Croatia is already over the 20 mark and the weekly review is expected this Thursday. It will be interesting to see how the government decide on what to do with Croatia and whether more notice will be given before the quarantine cut-off is set this time, which should be somewhat of an indication of how they might treat Greece should it hit the 20 mark next week. Just for a bit of perspective - if from now the daily figures are consistently 350 for the next 5 days until Sunday, then this will take Greece up to 20.2"
so was Greece never at 20? was the media calculating it wrong? i’m just confused as I am reading greece is at the threshold and then i’m reading they are nowhere near it...i really hope the calculation that has it at 13 is the one our government use!
the media used the 14 day rolling average which adds 7 days more cases be them lower. Currently it is said that the 7 day rolling average is used
I wonder if there could’ve been a problem with yesterday’s figures and some got delayed in reporting? It was an unexpected and seemingly very low figure compared to the week’s numbers before. As Greece has such low numbers anyway it would only take around 50 positive tests to be delayed a day to cause what is seen as another steep rise. If you take 50 from today’s number and add to yesterday’s then it seems to follow the recent trend more smoothly. The next couple of days will be very interesting to see and should give us all more of an idea. (Though I must stop myself counting down to 5:00 to see the new daily figure!)
yes I believe that is the case and yesterdays figures were for Sunday and staff are not around to gather everything up in time
Tomorrow's number will replace the 235 recorded last Wednesday 12th August. If it's around a similar number then the current 14.4 will not budge by much.
"Hello everyone, I've been following this post with a lot of interest and also some confusion ( I'm sure we all have).Thanks to everyone for all the frantic calculations, really impressive and informative.I do have a question, if anyone can answer - what's the limit / threshold where new cases can stay at/below for Greece to still be off the quarantine list? (I know it's impossible to be 100% certain on the criteria).Also, if you're booked with a tour operator such as TUi who have a quarantine guarantee, if it happens whilst you're away would they repatriate you early?ThanksStephen"
"@Scb74 it is 20 infections per 100,000 population over a rolling 7 day period. It is currently around 14. For a figure to look for as a daily number that would be at least 305 cases per day on average for a week.Edited: 2:56 pm, August 18, 2020 "
"@scb74 TUI did not repatriate for those in Spain, they said to continue holiday -if people wanted to book new flights then they could do so but at own expense.Edited: 2:58 pm, August 18, 2020 "
Worth a read ...https:/…
#431 Thanks for that info....I am flying with TUI and think I will get away ok...I’m prepared that things may change when I’m away but there has been no info as to what will happen if it does...will I be ordered home a few days in?? Thanks for clarifying!
"@AHLDN 430.That’s what I’ve been mentioning, too.It was Grant Shapps who uses the word average. Just dividing the 7 day total by 107 isn’t an average by any description."
True - you have to take a moving average. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to these numbers unless you assume the previous figure of 147 was artificially low and the 250 is artificially high (ie some cases from the 250 should actually have been included in the 147). Today's numbers will be interesting.
@436 Looks like Portugal might also be OK soon if trend continues there.Only worry with Greece is the average continues to rise. Hopefully it'll level out or drop this week.
Looks like 217 today.
The 7 day rolling average fell today so looking very good for Greece now.

#440 Worldometers uses 10.4M population and I note others on here using 10.7M We need to be consistent with how UK govt calculates so does anyone know what population number they use to determine the 20/100K value?
@441 I was thinking about this the other day and 10.7m is probably too low considering the people in the country at any given time is much higher when you factor in tourists.
if you read post 468 an this thread and it turns out to be true the British Press are going to have a field dayhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
"Nigel B #441, good question.The government is using the ECDC data, which you can download from here:https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-d…You can see it clearly lists Greece's population in Column J as 10,724,599.The government has been consistent in saying it's the ECDC data that they use, so that's what I'm using.I have no idea why there's a different figure at Worldometers.If you Google 'Greece population' you get 10.72 million, too.At this stage, it's not an issue.20 x 107 = 2,140 /7 = 305.720 x 104 x 2,080 /7 = 297.1The difference is 8.6 a day, or 60.2 a week. The chances of it coming down to 60 new cases in a week are extremely slim.And remember, the government are using this as a yardstick. I think if the figures were 290 a day, but rising rapidly all week, the government would pull the plug, even if the population were 10.7 million. But if it were 306 a day and had levelled off, or was coming down, they'd wait another week, even if the population were only 10.4 million."
"If you google '2020 Greece population' you get 10.4, 2019 is 10.7 population It makes slightly lower figures using 10.7 but in the scheme of things little differenceEdited: 2:28 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"The SunPaul Charles, the spokesperson for the Quash Quarantine group told Sun Online Travel: “Turkey is nowhere near being added and nor is Greece, as Turkey currently has 11.2 cases per 100k and Greece has 14.3. “So hopefully that is still good news for British consumers"" https:/…"
"Very good, some positive energy all round. Tomorrow's figure will replace the 204 recorded last Thursday 13th. Hopefully it will be a lower figure, this will maintain the trend moving downwards especially on a key date when quarantine decisions are expected to be announced for this weekend.Will also be interesting to observe what will happen with the likes of Croatia this weekend."
"Croatia is definitely knocking on the door... and seems to be rising quickly too. This month every day from 1st to 11th less than 100 (most less than 50), last few days has seen most days above 150 and some over 200:https:/…Roughly 2/5 the population of Greece so anything over 120 cases a day looks dodgy."
"I have Croatia down at over 29 per100k, serious problem for them. Greece needs a daily average of close to 300 to hit 20 per 100k, a daily increase of over 80 per day maintained for 7 days on current figures, over 570 extra a week. Think Greece is safe for at least another week before any measures are possible unless a huge spike occurs very soon. Very unlikely imho, enjoy your hols !Edited: 3:51 pm, August 19, 2020 "

I’m going early sept and it’s hard not to be positive when it will take 300 to top the scales
@Leonie 14 days is irrelevant. It is only a 7 day rolling average the UK uses. The government did their review today so any changes will be announced tomorrow. Greece won’t have any changes but Croatia might.
"Fair enough, wasn't sure only sharing in case it helps!"
"Im heading out on friday, so unsure if to go or not,so many conflicting reports.."
"I am flying out to Greece too on Friday, although not Skiathos unfortunately as couldnt get a booking but now feel all is good, at least for 7 day holiday as figs are holding up."
"Hope the numbers keep that way, have a wonderful time in Greece"
Looks like Croatia was confirmed to go on the list. Should see an announcement today. The review was yesterday. We aren’t going to the Greece putting out 300+ daily figures between now and next Wednesday for the next review so it is now very unlikely we will have a quarantine for Greece for the bank holiday weekend at least.
"Am I correct in my understanding that currently the UK government add a country to the quarantine list when it hits 20/100,000 and adds it to the fco no travel list when it reaches 30? Or am I wrong with those figures.Completely understand the government could change its criteria but trying to estimate our chances of quarantine / fco no travel for a trip to Greece departing 29 August returning mid September."
AHLDN #459Yes I'm starting to think a very costly early dash home before Sat 29th at 4am is thankfully looking less and less likely. With each passing day of numbers in the low 200s (hopefully lower) the numbers would have to skyrocket above 300 to hit the moving average threshold of 20. This is good for everyone on both sides.Croatia is a different story given their much lower population.
So 269 again today : https://eody.gov.gr/0820_briefing_covid19/With this I have the 7-day/100k at 14.7I suspect the 269 may be revised down once the worldometers figure is released shortly
"Austria and Croatia are binned from the safe corridor scheme. 14 days quarantine now required ...But Portugal is reinstated as safe ...Edited: 12:09 pm, August 20, 2020 "
Portugal added to the travel corridor is reassuring as it has very similar numbers comparing to Greece. Almost same population and almost the same 7 day rolling average number of new cases. The only difference is the trend.
"Yep, Worldometers has it at 250 now."
"Indeed the worldometers revised figure put it down to 250 : https:/…With this change I have the rate down slightly at 14.5 going off the ECDC daily figures and population numbers.Tomorrow's figure replaces the 251 recorded last Friday 14th August - the highest daily rise ever recorded for Greece under worldometers.

"Paul Charles@quashquarantine via twitter has greece at 14.1 down from 14.3 yesterday, on todays figures."
"Our friends are due to travel 9-16 September, they’ve just received an email from love holidays cancelling, Reason given ‘ due to current circumstances ‘"
@ David HMaybe the accommodation your friends were due to stay in is closed and LoveHolidays are unable to offer any alternative.I don't think your friends' cancellation has any far reaching implications for holidays to Greece in general.
Seems to be some very negative feedback on the groups about Love Holidays. TUI still retains pole position in the complaints field ...
"Paula C, the accommodation is open, we are booked in ourselves from 11 September.Friends have managed to rebook same flight and same accommodation, on exactly the same dates separately. And at a cost saving, so alls good with the world."
"Hi all, we're in a bit of a dilemma. Due to travel with TUI to Skiathos next friday 28th. If the government add Greece to the travel quarantine list next Thursday will our holiday be immediately cancelled by TUI ? Wondering whether to play the waiting game to see what develops or swap the holiday for a Portugal break now that they have been removed from the quarantine list."
"Are TUI selling holidays in Portugal for the remainder of this year?If they are, I'd wait and see. If Greece is cancelled, swap to Portugal then."
Yorkshiremouth it appears TUI are selling holidays to Portugal now. Dilemma now is how long to wait. Obviously we'll have a better idea next week but lm really not sure if TUI will cancel hols as soon as a potential quarantine is announced next Thursday. I'll try to get hold of them for clarification.
209 new cases today so this is good news
Adjusted down to 204. Even better.Now has to average 339 a day over the next 5 days for quarantine next week.
I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the biggest problem in changing the booking is that Portugal is not Greece...
"Steve, you are absolutely right but if Greece goes on the quarantine list it might be our next best option. Wife works for NHS and is really looking forward to a break in the sun after a grueling few months. Portugal might not be Greece but it aint Bridlington either."
"I have Ryan air tickets to Rhodes for 3 people , just as back up I experimented swapping them for faro. Came to 600"

Those of you who are flying out this weekend, have a brilliant time! We’re going on 1st September for a week and things seem optimistic so far - fingers crossed!"
"Yes I second that, lots of helpful information from people who have taken the time to understand and explains the facts. Finally going to order my currency and do my PLF with a bit more reassurance!"
264 new cases reported today and 29 at entry points into Greece.
@cosmos57 worldometer has todays figure at 243 for new cases
Official figures has Greece down to 14.0 7 day rolling average
"The chances of going over 20 next week are looking vanishingly small.That’s 3 days where the figure has not just been under the 307 benchmark, but substantially under.I don’t have my sums with me, but I think it’s need to be 350+ a day for the next four days, despite never being over 251."
"I get 14.2 but yeah it seems to be plateauing out. Good news for everyone if so. Needs to be 361 per day to trigger quarantine next week now.Edited: 2:00 pm, August 22, 2020 "
#483https://www.ekathimerini.com/256149/article/…
Pretty much no chance of Greece going on the quarantine list next weekend now.
"I agree. There seems to be evidence that it is plateauing now around the 240 mark, nowhere near 300 let alone the 360 figure required to trigger quarantine next week.

"It's all just rubbish by the press.I'm watching the figures like a hawk as due to go on the 4th September. Keeping everything crossed.At least I know if they announce it on the 3rd to start on the 5th I won't be going but if they announce it on the 10th to start on the 12th I'm OK as flying back on the 11th.Looking at the figures, I hope of course it doesn't happen at all!"
We are due to fly on the 4th September too. Keeping everything crossed!
283 cases today... any thoughts on how that impacts the likelihood of a change to travel advice for this weekend?
"None of you should be travelling until mid 2021 at the earliest. Yes, I do realise what impact that will have on jobs and the islanders. I lost my fireman brother to covid in June, so perhaps I am against any form of travel right now."
https://www.zerohedge.com/political/uk-offic…
@hereandthere20. None the 7 day rolling average per 100k is 14.9 so we won’t be seeing any impact yet.
"This moves the 7 day average from 14.2 to 14.8. I'm not sure that this necessarily means that ""none of you should be travelling"". It is the highest daily number yet although it is well below 20 which seems to be the trigger point."
Curious as to when Greece will likely hit 20 to trigger a possible quarantine if cases continue to rise at this rate? Maybe not too long if it increases 40 or so cases a day?
Lesvos now under restrictions ...https:/…
"Worldometer reporting 155 new cases today, probably lower numbers because of the weekend, but it will lower the average,for all who are interested."
"#498 by my estimation, it will be around 19 when I depart Zante on 11/9. I'm tracking how each day's number relates to the number 7 days previously and taking a 7 day average. On that basis at the moment on average the declared number each day is 10% higher than the same day 7 days ago. Of course the historical numbers don't reflect local restrictions such as the bars closing ""early"" (can't remember the last time I was in a bar at midnight!) and Greek schools returning mid September."
498 were does that number come from
"#501 so for a bit of fun, I predict tomorrow's number will be 274"
"#502 I take a look at how for example today's number relates to last Mondays. It is 155 vs 147 last week so is 5% higher than last Mondays. I do this for every day so compare last Tuesday with the Tuesday before, same for Wednesday, Thursday etc. That gives me 7 days worth of % changes which I average. That average over the last 7 days is currently 10%So I then overlay 10% on each historic day's last number to get an estimate of future declared numbers. For each day if you know the number of new infections and the population you can work out the rate by dividing the day's new infections by 100K. Add up 7 days worth of those calculations should give you a 7 day rolling average.Now I'm not the world's greatest mathematician so if I've got the theory wrong I'll be happy to be corrected!So my predictions for this week are:Tue 274Wed 232Thur 274Fri 224Sat 266Sun 301 (yesterday's was an usually high number though)Let's see ; I'm hoping the numbers will actually be less than these as local restrictions take effect. The Greek schools go back on 1/9 I think, so that may counteract any restriction benefits"
Hi Nigel do you mind telling me what your estimates are for 2/9 and 4/9 please
"#505 I estimate 2/9 to be 16.8 and 4/9 to be 17.2, but I'm an optimist, and I think the 10% growth rate I use might be a tad high. I'd rather be conservative though"
"I think I’ve developed an allergy to the word “scaremongering”. I used to hear this so many times in late Feb and early March when everyone was saying “we only have 200-300 cases, we’ll be ok, it’s just scaremongering”. After you work frontline in the NHS and see patients plus family dying due to covid and go through some drama that some of us went through then maybe you’ll have a different view. It’s not “doom an gloom”. We now know more about this that we knew 6 months ago. People are posting some numbers and statistics in here to help other make an informed decision. Nobody is trying to scare anyone. But the virus is still there. Due to go to Crete next week myself and I am absolutely desperate for a nice holiday. I will go if the numbers remain low as I know that I would probably be safer in there than in UK. What I probably can’t afford to do is to isolate 14 days on return. So that’s why all these “part-time scientists/statisticians” (as someone are calling them in here) are very useful for some of us.If you want to read or contribute to this forum them please feel free to do so.

"Hi,Long time lurker on these forums but rarely post. Have been keeping an eye I this thread and thanks to those keeping tabs of figures, has definitely helped put mind at ease.Just to give my own experience; me and my partner flew out this morning with TUI from Manchester - great flight, felt very safe despite full flight, all the better for arriving 45 mins early!It did take 20 mins or so to disembark, we were sat mid cabin so took a while for our row to be called. Waited another 20 mins queueing outside arrivals to get in. Lots pulled aside for testing today, I’d estimate 1/4 to a 1/3 of the flight (only one from each party is tested - the lead passenger on the PLF). So yes took about 1 hour from landing to getting to our transfer, but everyone very patient and again all felt very safe.Now looking forward to a week on this glorious island!"
"Thanks for the info Poseidon. We're flying from Manchester with TUI on Friday. Was there much open in the airport, duty free etc ?"
"I must agree with the last few posts.Having accurate statistical information here has been a massive help.Talking to several local bar/taverna owners over the last 48 hours, it’s clear that almost everyone on the island is COMPLETELY IN THE DARK about the U.K. government’s decision making, and have been eager and thankful to hear the facts."
"Yes more than I thought in Manchester T2 - big Duty Free shop, WHSmiths and a small Boots by the gates just as you enter departures (bit of a queue for this). Also the big cafeteria called Spinning Jenny. Security was a breeze, only about 3 TUI departures and 1 other airline this morning so a lot quieter than usual."
"Just bear in mind T2 closed from Sept 2 , TUI will operate from T1 ."
"Nigel B, it's 168 cases today so gladly not an accurate prediction."
Yep surprisingly low numbers today - very welcome news. Average moves back down to 14.2

I want to be optimistic too as i'm coming back on the 10th so I need to survive 2 Thursdays!Fingers crossed that there hasn't been under reporting over the last 2 days which would result in insane numbers tomorrow!
"My sister has a spare bed in her hotel room next week in town. As i'm off work anyway i'm 50/50 on whether or not to take up her offer and fly over from Birmingham on Saturday, returning Wednesday. Couple of questions, thanks in advance if you can help clarify my queries: * Is car and moped hire still available in town? * Does the UK Government always make announcements of closures on Thursdays? If this is the case, I could fly out on Saturday and return Wednesday worry free (work wise). * How restricted are restaurants in terms of Covid? 4 feet from the next table etc? Apologies if all these questions have been previously addressed or have obvious answers, i'm getting lost in all the noise."
"Hi Will,Am on the island at the moment. - from what I can see, there are plenty of vehicle hire places open and lots of hotel guests have hire cars- restaurants have a bit more spacing than usual, most seem to be trying to have the 1metre space between tables, and on beaches pairs of sun loungers are definitely spaced 2m apart.- I would imagine that unless Greece or some other country faced a sudden extraordinary increase in the space of a couple of days, the UK Government will stick to Thursday announcements for Saturday quarantine measures.Hope this helps."
"That was very helpful indeed, thank you so much. Seeing as you're there currently, was it worth the trip or does it feel a little hollow? It's only 250 quid or so for the flight, so it's not a major risk either way. Thanks again!"
"No worries!I had some slight apprehensions before flying out, mainly to do with the travel part, but honestly, now I’m here looking out over Koukounaries it was the best decision to come - I haven’t felt this relaxed and ‘normal’ in months. People are all respecting the rules from what I’ve observed - keeping masks on in shops and on the bus, and staff are reminding people as well. Everyone has been warm and welcoming.I’m staying in town and though it’s quietish during daylight hours, there is still a buzz on a night. I’d compare it to when I’ve been before at the end of May. I’d go for it!"
"Earliest I've ever been was early June and it was still lively enough - yes, I think i'll do it! Thanks again for your help."
"Big increase today, 293 new cases in Greece. Can anyone estimate how this impacts the projected rates for the coming week or so?"
Average goes back to 14.9 where it was the day before yesterday.
"Shouldn't really affect it too much as it's been pretty low the previous days and it's taken as an average over 7 days.PCAgency are reporting Greece 7 day average based on today's figures to be 14.1, well below the 20 figure the government apparently uses.I'm sure someone will be along to tell us what Greece will have to hit as a daily number to increase the average for next week but I'd imagine it would have to be 350+ ."
"#525 Based on a population of 10.7M I have current rate per 100K 7 day RA at 14.9. Using the official figures over the last 7 days rather than Worldometers, I have the number as 15.5. 293 cases is the largest since I've been tracking (1st August). The average rate of new cases is increasing at 8% currently, which by my estimation means the 20/100k will not be breached before I return on 11/9 (sorry, selfish!) and could be about 17.5 by then.If case numbers were to stay at 293 for the next 7 days, I think 20/100K will be breached on 8/9 which would be too soon to trigger quarantine on return being incepted on Saturday 12th.It might be interesting to see if the jump today was caused by a local ""cluster"" which may not repeat, and hopefully the 293 will stay as a high outlier"
I don't think it's a local cluster. Possibly some delayed test results from the past 2 days which were significantly lower than the weekend numbers.
Eleven youth test positive returning from Zante. How long will it be before our Government pull the plug?https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/corona…
"Lordy, Delboy, that's worrying.Maybe it's something like this that will make the government think more seriously about quarantine rather than the number of daily cases being reported."
#529 Yes you could be on to something there. Sum of last Tue and Wed is 462 whilst if you add today with yesterday you get 461. Yesterday's 168 number was suspiciously low whilst today's is very high. I wonder whether there was a reporting lag somewhere yesterday and today shows some catch up. I'm not panicking yet by any means. Lets see what tomorrow brings!
@DelboyAylesbury That is concerning. This is similar to what triggered the Spain quarantine suddenly. I think it is possible they will trigger the quarantine tomorrow based on this. However the rolling average number is too low at the moment so difficult to be sure. I don’t expect they will trigger it just yet.
It just shows those youths have gone around Greece without any knowledge on them or of them being reported as positive and then flying home
@DelboyAylesbury It also shows the parties are causing a significant amount of transmission. It seems a significant number of outbreaks have been related to parties.
well yes I mentioned that would be the case very early on. Drinking clouds the mind and has the effect of losing the social distancing and then mixing and partying is just what this virus needs to spread.
"@533What was the 7 day MA for Spain when they got the quarantine decision though?I don't think a Daily Mirror story of 20 asymptomatic youngsters in Zante will change the government's decision-making protocol myself.Could be wrong, but I'd be very surprised to see Greece get the quarantine decision based on this when ""the number"" is under 15."
I think Spain was around 39.4 on the rolling av of 14 days at that time when none of us knew the Government were working to a 7 day rolling av
Exactly. Today's number reflects the very very low numbers for the precious two days. If the number for each of the last three days had been 200 nobody would be flapping but that's the effect of the last three days' numbers on the average.I say keep calm and trust in the process. The decision for this week will have already been taken anyway by now so tomorrow's numbers won't matter (for this week).
"Indoors pubs, restaurants and especially nightclubs are on the top the most “risky” activities for getting covid. Add some extra drinks and “I’m on holiday, I don’t care” attitude and you have the perfect recipe. I hate to say it as I was once a teenager myself but kids these days don’t seem to get it at all. If in March/April the most affected age groups were over 60 now it’s shifting more toward youngsters. Maybe they will be ok with it because they are young and fit but their parents or grandparents might not be that lucky.Even if the numbers are high today, I doubt that Greece will be added on the quarantine list this week.

"""Indoors pubs, restaurants and especially nightclubs are on the top the most “risky” activities for getting covid. Add some extra drinks and “I’m on holiday, I don’t care” attitude and you have the perfect recipe.""And these kids were sat near people of various ages on transfer buses, on the plane, in Border Control queues and possibly on public transport home.I wonder how many people these 11 will have infected since they came home."
Not saying that all the teenagers are the same. I’m pretty sure that there are lots of responsible ones as much as there are lots on adults who don’t care. See Harry Maguire who went to Mykonos to fight with the police.
"Some of the most Covid-irresponsible people are ""old."" I know loads of folk over 70 whose reaction to Covid has been ""I'm living for today - I'd rather have 2 more years of fun than 10 more years of lockdown imprisonment"".Not fair to target ""the young"" - plenty of people of all demographics are resisting lockdown and social distancing."
"Not really targeting the youngsters but I think that the pensioner who visits his next door neighbour for a cup of coffee it’s probably a bit more responsible than those who are attending illegal raves and parties with hundreds of people. For example, USA had almost 100.000 teenagers under the age of 19 who tested positive in the last 2 weeks of July alone. Lots of countries are reporting the same trends -> large clusters of teenagers following parties or partying holidays abroad."
"True. And I'm not arguing with that. Young people are not really affected by this virus and have been locked down (and probably on furlough/out of work) for nearly 6 months so they feel as though enough is enough. I'm not ""young"" myself but if I was 20 and looking at my prospects as a result of the economic crisis caused by the response to Covid I'd be partying and living for today too. And I'm suspicious of anyone who says otherwise.I suppose my point is that people of all ages have had enough and are letting their hair down - including people whose main priority (understandably) is getting to Greece for a holiday."
"It looks like it's 269 today, can anyone tell me how far it's off the government's figure of 20 per 100,000,booked to go next week so getting a bit concerned"
"Hi I would like to know the figure as well please, due to fly on the 18th Sept, I know it is 3 weeks yet and anything can change."
"I make it 15.5 cases per 100k based on today’s figures. The UK government are considered countries which have more than 20 cases per 100k over the previous 7 days. They meet to make the decision on a Wednesday, announce it on Thursday then it generally takes effect on the Saturday at 4am. So in order for Greece to be added to the red list in the review on Wednesday it would need to hit 332 cases per day for the next 4 days consistently."

Good news 177 today as opposed to 243 last week.The average moves down again :)
"Brill, thanks for the update."
"Let’s see what today brings. Last Sunday’s number was high at 283, let’s hope for less."
157 new cases announced today. Trend going into the right direction.
That’s a British problem not a Greek one
"Read a complaint earlier on TUI website: a mother was saying that her 18 years old daughter together with 18 (yes, eighteen) other friends went to Zante and they all tested positive on return. I am sorry, but you have to be absolutely idiot to mix with people with 18 other households and not expect to get the virus."
"Also, they can't really confirm that no one from this group had covid when they left the UK and not only they spread it amongst them but to other tourists too."
https:/…This is the article about the flight in question. Such a shame for the people who went and did follow social distancing rules whilst in Greece.
"Definitely a UK problem now, but it's been imported from Zakynthos.So does not count on Greek figures. 180+ on that aircraft, who have been mixing with other folks for five days."
Why did any of them bother getting a test? No ones I’ll.
183 today Tweet I have just seen shows Greece on 13.7 so going in the right direction
15-4 last I’ve seen. So many variations
I've got it at 14.38 with today's figures. Fingers crossed it keeps low.
"Yes Hilde, that's the tweet I was referring to but couldn't post for some reason"
