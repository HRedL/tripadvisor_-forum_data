"I know it’s a long time away but you do have to book early for best flight options/price. Will everything be open in the wake of COVID 19Parks, Hotels, Restaurants? Is it possible that COVID 19 will disrupt the start of next year to. Thanks in advance."
"“Will everything be open in the wake of COVID 19Parks, Hotels, Restaurants?Is it possible that COVID 19 will disrupt the start of next year to.”Who knows? WHO REALLY KNOWS?"
"It’s possible Covid19 could have an effect all of next year. Equally possible a vaccine has been approved and it might be already. Personally I suspect it will be somewhere between the 2.Orlando Vic is right, though, nobody knows - even the experts."
"Without a vaccine, It Is “ possible that COVID-19 will disrupt “ our lives for quite a long time"
"It’s hard to know Eoin, if we did it’d be great for us all really. I’d like to hope with every scientist working on a vaccine that it’d come sooner rather than later. If you’re only booking now I’d maybe try push out the date you want to go if you can. The later you can go is probably giving you maybe a safer chance at actually being able to go with the virus maybe less of a worry so you can enjoy everything going on in Orlando :)"
"I know the book early for best price has been what we experienced in the past. In this new world I would personally hold off. You don’t know if they will institute changes you don’t want to put up with, if a second wave Of Covid19 happens in the fall and winter. Who knows what each of our personal finances will be. Too many variables to book ahead in my mind."
Thanks David. Yep might push it out till April. But sure let’s see what the next few week’s brings.
Thank you for your reply. Yep let’s wait and see but I think caution before booking.
"I would caution any non-US citizen from booking flights to the US for the foreseeable future. Flights might still be on sale, but it doesn't mean you can actually board the plane with your non-US passport. Unless there are flexible cancellations that far out, I would steer clear."
Let me check with my buddy Aladdin and he can ask his genie what the forcast is for the covid19.
Lol PirateI'm not really understanding why anyone would be booking a trip today. Disney is closed with no opening date. There's no vaccine. And there are all sorts of travel restrictions. Are people in denial?
"Hi Eoin I'm concerned about Easter 2022, weather it will be all up and running by then ??, I can only advise to book whatever is possible with free cancelation option, if you are planning to stay off site I think booking.com would be a good place to look at booking your hotel as they offer free cancelation on most rooms, I know that aerlingus are waving their flight change fee up untill June in the wake of this horrendous virus, so they might extend that privilege longer, or at least use a good rep travel agency, and lay a small deposit down that's not going to brake your bank if the hols goes belly up. Good luck with your planning and fingers crossed for everyone"
God your so funny !! Welcome to a adult conversation.
"Orlando local here, as of May 4th, we have started reopening certain business at 25% capacity. My understanding is that parks might be closed until the end of the year. It might be too soon to call the shots for February 2021 but things slowly moving in the right direction.This dashboard does a pretty good job at keeping daily tabs on the virus here in the US, it might come in handy: https://ncov19us.com"
