"From the news desk “ The measles outbreak prompted the Ministry of Health to issue a warning to those travelling to Auckland on Thursday.All people travelling to Auckland, including infants aged between 12 and 14 months, should be vaccinated for measles at least two weeks before travelling, it said.”Be aware that over 778 measles cases are confirmed, over 50 schools are affected. But most importantly some infected persons have been confirmed as passengers on airline flights to and from NZ. The article does say that the risk of infection is small.Edited: 1 year ago "

"Manurewa High School outbreak:https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/397699/m…from the article:""Ms Petousis-Harris (University of Auckland's senior lecturer in vaccinology), told Morning Report there are pockets of really low vaccination coverage in the local community which is contributing to the spread of measles. The reasons for this is a combination of things, she said, including older generations not being vaccinated, lack of access to healthcare and resistance to vaccinations."""
#2 everyone in nz has access to healthcare and the MMP vaccine is available free to all babies and schoolchildren so the only reason those who havent been immunised is due to their own beliefs or laziness.MMP was provided through all nz schools and a third vaccine was advised to all school children about ten years ago so that those who missed the full two doses of the vaccine were fully immunised.All measles cases in nz from 2012 have been linked to travellers bringing the measles from overseas - usually travelling by airplanehttps:/…2019-measles-outbreak-informationEdited: 1 year ago 
"""The reasons for this is a combination of things, she said, including older generations not being vaccinated, lack of access to healthcare and resistance to vaccinations."" Is a quote from the vaccinologist from the University of Auckland ""While the vaccination coverage rate for two-year-olds in New Zealand is at 91% – comparable to Australia – the coverage rate for those aged 16-29 is believed to be lower. Data on older groups is patchy.""from the article:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/3…Edited: 1 year ago "
Older generations (pre 1969) have been advised they don't need to be vaccinated as the chance are they will have already had measles as a child.Vaccination is free to anyone under 18.Edited: 1 year ago 
"But yet, this is still happening:https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/1154…From the article:""The total US numbers show just how serious New Zealand's epidemic is. From January 1 to August 22 this year, the US had 1215 individual cases of measles in 30 states.The US has a population about 68 times that of New Zealand but so far this year has had only about 400 more cases than this country."""
"#6 confirmed cases. in NZ healthcare and doctors visits for children and babies are free. Having lived in USA I met lots of unwell people who couldnt afford to go to the doctor, so the word confirmed cases is pretty important. If the health system in USA doesnt know about the cases they are never reported,"
"nzp0ppy,Your post # 7 concerning the USA is completely anecdotal and not based on medical facts. I have conveyed here what the medical community has reported - no conjecture. Fact, there is a rising epidemic of measles in NZ. Visitors need to be informed.Edited: 1 year ago "
From world health organisation. There is a worldwide outbreak and trend worldwide 300 percent worldwide. Its not just nz as the world population is very transient now. https:/…Edited: 1 year ago 
its important for travellers to be aware the measles outbreak is a worldwide trend “U.S. measles cases in first five months of 2019 surpass total cases per year for past 25 years”
"nzp0ppy,Per Post #9, yes everywhere there is an epidemic tourist should be vigilant. This is the New Zealand forum so that is why it is being discussed here as the epidemic in NZ continues to accelerate unabated.Per Post #10 The USA is not currently experiencing an epidemic of measles as is occurring in NZ.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Travel to the South Island and avoid Auckland. There have not been many cases down that way (most of those have been in Christchurch). If you are immunised (at least 2 weeks before arrival) travellers should be fine. It's not something you need to put your trip off for, unless travelling with small unvaccinated children or immune compromised persons."
#12 good advice and correct.#11 - yes the USA also has measles outbreak with second largest number of measles cases reported already for the year to date in the last twenty years.
"nzp0ppy,It is not an epidemic in the USA as it is in New Zealand. Currently, NZ's epidemic is accelerating with new populations at risk.""Public health experts are warning the spread of measles to the Pacific Islands is “inevitable” as the most serious outbreak in 20 years grips New Zealand.""From the article:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/3…"
"Heavens people! It matters little whether New Zealand or the United States is, or is not, having a worse time of it, or whether the United States is, or is not, in an epidemic. What does matter is that this is a NASTY disease, that people entering or leaving the country by air are at particular risk just now if they are not vaccinated, and what makes me angriest, is that it is now quite unnecessary, as the Measles Vaccine has been available in this country since the early 1970s.It is even more unnecessary in a country that gives vaccinations free, subsidises doctors visits (although more could be done here for people who have little money), and where hospitalisations are funded by the tax system. There are a few reasons people cannot be vaccinated - for example if your immune system is suppressed, and/or you are pregnant, then you shouldn't have the measles vaccine, but most people who don't have it believe the emotive appeals of the antivax brigade, suggesting health care authorities want to make the country's children autistic. (I'd rather like to know what, exactly, the health care authorities are supposed to get out of that one!)The latest crisis I read about was the headmaster of an Auckland boy's school having to ring around twenty other schools, after it was discovered measles was possibly/probably transmitted at his school's recent function. Worse still, through my own networks I am hearing of children admitted to Auckland Hospitals with various and sundry complications of measles infection, including brain swelling (encephalitis). And that, needless to say, is dangerous, and causes me to wish the anti-vaccination lobby - including the ones that actually mean well - to a truly fiery damnation.

"cdn,Agree, so sad what you are relating about the children in New Zealand. Hopefully, this thread and the original thread on this topic in the New Zealand Forum, see here:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g25510…will help alert the traveling public to the current measles epidemic in New Zealand.Edited: 1 year ago "
"People do not need to be unduly worried if they are immunised.In fact, I don't think we should be letting un-immunised visitors into the country.A large portion of people falling ill are 20-49 year olds, so not just children. This age group should also be getting immunised if they are unsure they have been in the past.Yes, be aware of the fact we have an epidemic (mainly in Auckland, as stated above at this stage) but no need to let that put most people off travelling.Edited: 5:00 pm, September 01, 2019 "
so true #18. that would solve all the problems as all cases of measles in nz since 2012 have been linked to people bringing it in from overseas.
"# 18 ""In fact, I don't think we should be letting um-immunised visitors into the country.""As Auckland, a city with an international airport, is currently a loci of distribution of a measles epidemic do citizens of NZ currently show proof of an up to date Immunization schedule before traveling abroad? The recent known case of a NZ citizen infected with measles traveling to many public places in the USA including Disneyland may have been prevented. Plus, as stated in Post # 18 ""A large portion of people falling ill are 20-49 year olds"" which would include a cohort of potential non-immunized NZ citizens leaving on planes from New Zealand to over seas destinations.Edited: 10:17 pm, September 01, 2019 "
"Yes, swimfan but that is up to receiving countries as to whether they wish to allow them entry."
"New Zealand officials check and allow those without updated measles immunization, for example, to board aircraft for other countries?"
"#22 why would they? each country sets its own biosecurity and its not up to the airline staff to monitor. They can, however, not issue VISAs if certain requirements not met.Edited: 12:14 am, September 02, 2019 "
21 and 23; the unvaccinated NZ resident with measles was allowed to leave NZ to USA and visited Disneyland and other tourist areas they were apparently checked per 21 yes response prior to departure for proof of vaccinations? Is that what 21 is saying yes to?
"nxp0ppy,The tears you are displaying in Post #25 should be shed for the suffering children related by CDP in Post #15:""children admitted to Auckland Hospitals with various and sundry complications of measles infection, including brain swelling (encephalitis).""The measles epidemic occurring now in NZ is completely the fault of the citizens of New Zealand - not outside forces - because of a lack of vaccinations by NZ citizens ""A large portion of people falling ill are 20-49 year olds"" and they then do not vaccinate the most vulnerable in society - the children who are left to suffer by the neglect of the NZ adults as outlined in Post # 15SadEdited: 6:42 am, September 02, 2019 "
"#26 you have assumed they are nz citizens. Just because people are in Auckland doesnt mean they are nz citizens.There does seem to be some statements without first hand knowledge or experience but by quoting one line statements. The thing is fellow travellers - be aware and makr sue you are immunised. But mostly - those travelling with babies need to seek medical advice.Its just going going to a country with zika, malaria, dengue, ebola, tb.

"nzp0ppy,NZ residents - citizens - the 20-49 year olds that have not been vaccinated that reside in New Zealand and did not have their children vaccinated.

"This is a meaningless discussion. Most sensible people agree that children should be vaccinated. A brief look on google finds the rate in NZ is 92% while USA and Australia is 94%. I have wonders that the ethnic makeup and socio economic status of South Auckland might be a cause of the severity of the outbreak there. In Australia some states have 'no jab no play' rules banning unvaccinated children from childcare centres. However I have a friend in Sydney whose niece is a health nut and will not have her 4 boys vaccinated but such rules do not worry her as Daddy (grandfather of the boys) is a multi multi millionaire. He and his wife take family (2 sons, 1 daughter, their partners and about 7 grandchildren) and nanny to Aspen every December flying first class. So there are idiots in all strata of society. When i began travelling in the 1970's vaccinations were just part of the process of travelling, these days with the decreased risks people have become too careless."
