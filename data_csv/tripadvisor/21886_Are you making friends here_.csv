"Well, it's just over 7 weeks the Layover Lounge has been up, and judging by the number of posts and replies, quite a few people are watching it.Do you feel like you have friends on here? It's because, I do! I often feel like I'm chatting with people I see out shopping, or while walking- people I don't know personally, but who I see now and then, and like to talk to when we meet.Do others feel like that?"
"I would not go so far, as to say “Friends,” but many folk with common interests, common concerns, common experiences, and all very nice.Hunt"
"No I dont feel that way. I see names I know from a few other forums I follow, but as for friends? No, not yet."
"It's definitely a busy forum. There are people whose writing I'm really enjoying on here, and who I think I'd become friends with if I were to meet them. There's even one who I probably will meet. @Centralvic - the challenge with meeting you would of course be that I'd have to overcome my fear of getting crashed into in Ballarat again."
Sorry but no.
"I think this new forum is the best thing that has happened to TA for a long time. It seems like I've wandered in to a large coffee shop, the treats/coffee room of a conference on travel, or a cocktail party, if you like, where you can chat with just about anyone on just about any topic. It certainly has a warm, friendly ambiance, imo.I'm glad you have found friends on here, Centralvic. That's a pretty special result."
I have a similar view as MuftiVancouver.A bit like your local bar where you might have a friendly chat about topics of mutual interest whilst passing the time
"Well, the posts of #5 and #6 are the way I meant it to be, not asking to crash at your house when we can travel again.But, I've enjoyed the friendly chat along some of the topics I've been interested in. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it?!"
"I think I know what you mean centralvic, it is nice to chat to like minded people.I am not sure I would call it friends, but definitely acquaintances.It is an enjoyable forum, and pretty well the only active one on TripAdvisor at the moment."
"HiVery much agree with what has been said so farI know that some people wee bemused by the forum to begin with and TA_Barbara's (she will be missed) thread announcing it had a life of it's own for a while. It now seems to have settled down and as Mufti says it is one of the best things to happen on the site for a whileI hope in the months ahead when we gradually get back to a new normal, whatever that may be, that it remains open and active to run along side the OTC"
"Centralvic ... I agree with your comment.... ""I often feel like I'm chatting with people I see out shopping, or while walking- people I don't know personally, but who I see now and then, and like to talk to when we meet."" And MuftiVancouver in post #5 expresses many of the thoughts that I have about this forum too. Also agree with flipflop_man about the forum remaining active going forward. It's a good forum :))Edited: 6:00 am, May 05, 2020 "
"Not on this forum - yet.I agree with Muffti on 5, very well put and like MrFF I think it would be a good thing if it continues. It's a wonderful thing to 'chat' with people from other countries - which is what travel is all about and things can be posted here that can't be posted on the forums.I've been around an awful long time and when the site was quieter I did get to know some other regular posters, enough to get a grip on what they were really like.It's been possible to meet some of them when I'm travelling to their destination or home town and for a meal or coffee it's made a trip even better. And, for someone who's not great at judging what people are like normally it turns out well for reading posts and getting a grip.I still have promised meetings with some that I've put off because life threw me in another direction. This lockdown has made me more determined to do those trips within my own country and meet those people at last."
"It's amazing that I get to talk with people online from so many far away places that I've never visited, and unfortunately, probably never will. Of the 14 posts here so far, only one other poster from my own country. When I see where some of you live, I wonder if you are my long lost cousins!"
"Quite possible Illini. I have a lot of decendante in the US as we arrived as one of the first settlers in the North and goodness didn't we spread!But I haven't got as far as Illinois yet, just know there was a firefighter and a soldier. The name is still going.Just so you can see, this is where I livehttps:/…exmoor-national-parkReally need to get out there now! My back garden isn't doing the trick after 7 weeks."
"When Hunt sends out the invitations and we all show up at his wine cellar that will be a hoot!Until then, this has been fun and I hope the Layover Lounge continues even after all this hopefully comes to an end.I know that there are kind people on this forum and while close friendships might not have been made we have become a busload of friendly riders."
"IlliniTrav, I am the third American on here, lol...and from Illinois like you. I don't know that I would say actual friends, but more like friendly virtual acquaintances! And surprisingly, some of my virtual friends (especially from the New Orleans forum and Road Trip forum), I have more in common with (traveling) than I do with my two real-life best friends who don't like to travel! I look forward to reading the comments on this forum every day - glad I found it!!"
"No.Because to me, at least so far, it seems like the people who are doing most of the chatting back and forth and posting new thread already appear to know each other. Perhaps from other TA forums?"
"I wouldn't say friends, but I find this a friendly forum, and enjoying it. You really don't get to know others posting on a forum, but on my usual forum, finally, three other members and myself were all going to meet at the same resort, and gave lunch with another member staying close by, well it didn't happen, everything was cancelled....sad thing is, now it probably will never happen...very disappointed.Edited: 11:21 am, May 05, 2020 "
"Cheers! Thanks for the offer -lol.Don't get me wrong, I am very much enjoying having this forum. Smart of TA to put it in place now since there's not an awful lot to talk about on the Destination pages at the moment."
"Suze, I don't think most of us know each other at all. I am very familiar with Loup Garou as we are both frequent visitors to New Orleans, a place we both love. And I have seen some other posts from IlliniTrav and we live in the same state, but that is about all.Like you, I am enjoying this forum because the destination forums are pretty dead at the moment!!"
"Lori, don't give up hope about your meet-up! I have been on the New Orleans forum for 15 years, and got to recognize many of the names on the forum. In 2010, I got to meet about 6 or 7 of the frequent posters - we met at an event in New Orleans. Then a few years later, maybe 2012, some other frequent posters organized a big meet-up, and we probably had 20 or so frequent posters on the New Orleans forum (we all met up in New Orleans). That group grew every year and at the last event, a couple of years ago, we probably had 60 people!! So I have actually met many people in person and have made lifelong friendships!! The two ladies who were the organizers of our events were Canadian sisters from Toronto. While most of us in the group were Americans, we also had quite a few Canadians, and a few from England. We had a blast when we all got together!"
"Jlr #24,I have never met any of the folk on the NOLA Forum. When “the Canadian Sisters” were holding meet-ups, we were just never in town.It’s the same for the pub-meets on the London Forum. Came close a few times, but we always seemed to be in town, the week before, or the week after. I’d have been happy to buy a round, or two, but never happened.Hunt"
"Also, back in the active days of ChowHound, I think that there was more comradery on some forums, such as Hawaii. However, there the focus was just dining.Hunt"

"If the forums disappear TA might lose bookings.If someone recommends a particular hotel the OP will then go to the TA reviews, read them and possibly book through TA.No forums will mean I will have no reason to go on TA at all so also no reviews"
"I agree with Ariel. I’m always the optimist, but the way things are going ⬇️, and all these changes (for the worse), and, now, the massive layoff, and their stock crashing, I doubt they will be around much longer.However, fingers crossed that they pull through."
@25) that would be great a get together like that..sounds like fun. If TA ever stopped and I didn't have my forum I logged into everyday...I would have to go into therapy....go through a withdrawal stage...lol
"Hmmm, I think TA will survive. I have noticed a lot of local advertising on it."
"Well, after a good night's sleep, I've come back on and seen pretty much comments that seem to be like what I was feeling. I think most of you get my meaning- that's it's been fun 'meeting' people.I used to walk my dog a lot around home. In 3kms we covered a lot of streets, and chatted to a lot of people, getting to meet a few of them more regularly. Then, with no dog, it all changed. No-one talks unless you have a dog! Then this began, and it was a bit like meeting out walking.On the travel forums I've found that if it got off-topic there was usually someone trying to censor it. Okay, it was meant to be about travel, but it was often funny, and a lot more enjoyed it than slammed it. I'm enjoying the banter (dare I say it- 'friendly' banter?!) on here, especially with the funnier subjects. So....I feel like I'm chatting to friends. Sure, acquaintances is probably the more correct word, but it's not as friendly! And it wouldn't have fit on the heading. :)PS, I think Hunt will have drunk his cellar dry by the time we can all agree on a date to meet!"
"Centralvic, you are right about dogs! We have lived in our small town for 25 years, but the only people we knew were our neighbors. We got a rescue dog two years ago, and now that my husband walks him around 3 or 4 times a day, he has met everyone - even the kids waiting for the schoolbus who love to pet him!!LoupGarou - it's too bad that you didn't get a chance to meet the Canadian sisters - they are a lot of fun and we did so many fun things at the yearly get-togethers...really miss those fun times!!"
"Well some are still doing ok ""Tripadvisor Inc says CEO STEPHEN KAUFER'S FY 2019 totalcompensation was $2.46 million versus about $2.0 million in FY 2018 and CFO ERNST TEUNISSEN'S FY 2019 total compensation was $6.3 MILLION VERSUS $3.8 MILLION IN FY 2018"""
"Stingray #38,Well, I have to eat my words. Obviously those Influencers, Bloggers and Green Ticks were more profitable, than I could ever have imagined!Guess that Lady Gaga, and Giardia paying big $’s to become an Influencer was a good thing?Hunt"
"I’d like to make a “strong” comment (much stronger than Hunt’s) about the information StingRay has provided in post #38, however will abstain, as it would probably get me booted off."
"Thank you, Hunt. That would be very nice."

"If online friends count, than many good friends (Ariel is one of them).However, I found real friends on TA. We had exchanged some emails, as we used to live in the same town. Then by accident we ended up moving to another town (Sudbury) and found each other - luckily, we are very close neighbors. Last year we had been enjoying our travel related dinners together... had one Spanish, one Italian, one Indian... and then we decided on a soup lunch back in February. You can probably easily guess that this soup lunch has not happened yet. Planning on a barbecue sometime in the summer."
"Oh if we are branching out beyond only online and only the new ""Layover Lounge""... yes I now have in real life friends I have made thru Trip Advisor forums... mostly for Puerto Vallarta where I've met many interesting people to meet for drinks, lunch, rentals, etc. And a few real connections from Oahu and Seattle forums."
"I have to say that the layover lounge has saved me from going a bit nuts. The destination forums, where active, are pretty much reduced to people asking desperately if their trip will still happen (even if the evidence says otherwise), or how to get refunds from hotels, airlines, tour operators. Or that their tour operator phone queues are 3 hours long. Very depressing, I got to the stage where I was avoiding TA. But then lockdown happened, and I live alone. Yes, I talk to friends and family but it’s lovely to have a place where i can drop in to chat about travel in general, or things totally unrelated to travel - from favourite films to Eurovision. I know Ashtonian from various destination forums, and Hunt from air travel, but this forum has brought me into contact with people from everywhere from Canada to Finland to Australia. I am very grateful for the layover lounge and the people I have “met”. Hunt, you’d best start stocking up that wine cellar as it sounds like we’re all coming round to yours..!Edited: 4:57 am, May 14, 2020 "
"Friends no, but its great to find out the likes and dislikes of many a poster whom i see on the regular TA forms beyond what they think about a resort, restaurant or destination, i have to confess i often type with a pint in hand (at the appropriate time) and it feels like having a good old natter down the local, can only hope TA keep this going when we get back to normal, as i for one will miss it."
"I remember when this Layover Lounge was opened by TA. I peeked in, and saw what seemed to be the entire OTC crowd hanging out here. Not for me.But FFM was such a cheerleader for this concept, that I peeked in again. Found many interesting and intelligent topics, and much interesting reading. Definitely, very different vibe than OTC, and, perhaps, that’s why they left. Happy to be here.Edited: 1:02 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"NYU....as soon as the OTC crowd realised there were lots of ""serious"" threads on here and not just daft emoji games...they beat a hasty retreat!"
"I love the friendly chat. The OTC was not my style. This Layover Lounge seems to be educated and funny discourse, more my styleI am new. For those who haven't already guessed, I tend to be blunt and outspoken, which sometimes lends itself to others disliking me. However, anyone who ""knows"" my years of contributions, know while I may disagree with someone, I may also have profound respect for their thoughts. Keep on posting and do enjoy a glass of anything with me, as we are still in lockdown until June. Stay safe and well!"
"I personally have been enjoying this forum. Some threads remind me that we are all going through this same bizarre and difficult time, together. Others make me laugh, and that's something we all need right now. So, thank you TA for doing this, and thanks to the many interesting and kind people for participating."
I think this forum will be interesting to look back on when we get out the other side of this crisis as it will show how we all felt about certain things at the timeWe will also be able to see whether we were right or wrong about certain things
"Bravo Spanish Steps!It will be quite interesting, FFM.The bottom line is, no matter where we live, we are all in this together. Right now, I need the laughter and day Dreams. I thank those who have provided the same."
"The Layover Lounge has become one of the nicest parts of the day. I look forward to those few minutes when everything is done and I sit down and read what people have been thinking that day.There were references to OTC a few posts earlier. What is that? I have tried to work it out and simply cannot.Nora, it is amazing how you met up with your other Sudbury friend. As you know we have been chatting for years now and she has told me all about your get togethers. The plan has always been that she would come to Australia or I would return to Boston so we too could meet in person. That is looking a long way off now.I have also noticed Ariel on lots of the forums that I regularly peek at, mainly European ones. From memory Ariel you were on the Vienna forum a lot last year, do I have that right?"
"Same here Djh,i thought it means Over The Counter, but dont understand how it works here."
"I have made a few ""friends"" on TA and occasionally swop messages about things of mutual interest.However last week I answered a question from someone who was looking at a place and they mentioned that they liked to go to naturist beaches. So I gave a bit of advice and the next post was asking to swap photo's etc.I like to converse from a distance"
OTC is Off Topic Chatter. It's a little different from the Layover Lounge.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i96…
I really think LL is a lifesaver for me. I am very cut off and although I do have friends in the real world certain constraints on my life due to caregiving have made it hard to get out. So it is fun to have short conversations here and kind of openly eavesdrop on others. I am hearing about all kinds of lives and all kinds of food and really enjoying this bus ride.
"Thanks for explaining what OTC means. I too thought it meant ""over the counter"". I will have to have a look at that forum.Nora, I would so love to come to Boston again. I have only been once, in winter of 2014, sadly before I met our mutual friend on here. I totally loved Boston, although we only had a short time. From memory we stayed for three nights, at the Lennox Hotel in the city. We spent most of our time following the Freedom Trail, as well as visiting Cambridge one day. It was a really lovely city."
"djh.Believe me, you do not want to look at the OTC forum as you simply won't understand what is going on there. It's beyond me that's for sure and I've tried a few times now to fathom it out and what makes some of the posters on there ""tick"". One starts emoji posts and then posts hundreds of times himself on each one? I'm guessing he is just trying to up his post count as he has over 50,000 posts showing and the majority have to be on the OTC. I agree that Boston is a great place to visit and have been more times than I can remember. So much history and visiting Cambridge and Harvard was a real treat, as was touring the USS Constitution and USS Cassin Young. We've stayed in numerous different hotels including the Sheraton and the Park Plaza. It's somewhere I never tire of visiting.Edited: 8:41 am, May 16, 2020 "
What happened to your 3500 followers? Aren't they your friends?
"Nora, it was freezing in January! The weather was beautiful and sunny though, so really nice for all the walking that we did.At the time we travelled to the US, we were in a group of 8, with my inlaws, husband and son. While we were in New York we became a group of 11 when my two daughters joined us from the UK. I planned and organised the entire trip - I think I must have been insane although it all went pretty well.The main reason we had to travel in winter is that, as you said, it is our summer. At that time my husband was working for a company that only allowed leave in January, and also my son and two nephews were studying at the time and January is our long summer holiday, so there really wasn't a choice.The wonderful thing about the cold in Boston was that my sister-in-law had never seen snow and desperately wanted to see it. We were having late evening cocktails at Top of the Hub, and it suddenly started to snow! We got to walk back to the Lenox Hotel in gentle snow, sit by an open fire in our room and watch it some more, and then the next day wake up to a snow covered Boston. All the cold was worth it to see the look on her face.I would love to come back one day in Autumn (Fall), my favourite season.Edited: 4:27 am, May 17, 2020 "
"Nora, it was a huge ask, much more than I realised. I must have managed it well because they want to do it again! Luckily I can honestly say that we can't afford it just yet, as we have a couple of trips already planned that will take what we have saved.Trying to find hotels and restaurants that pleased everyone was very hard indeed. In the end though it all worked out, we all saw lots of the US and had fun. There was only one argument between my husband and his brother, and that was on the last day, so not too bad at all."

I have a feeling that chefathome is a great recent addition to my own circle of TA friends and soulmates. So glad she joined the Lounge. We got to know each other on the Sicily and Naples destination forums - we share the same passion for both.
Interesting. Spammed 3 times in June and July with no one adding anything.

"Chefathome, I am sure your arrival to The Layover Lounge made many of us happy, not just me.How J&D’s post is related to this topic?"
#83 - No kidding that. This is a nice place to chat and meet new people. The TA/OTC is downright scary!
"In May I said I didn’t have friends here, I still don’t, but feel like I know some on here a little better. In fact have got to know a couple of my own forum members a little better, which I think is great.BTW, I post on OTC, I’m not scary at all. I just don’t get involved with those political threads...it’s all US related anyway."
"Lori. From what I can gather about the OTC forum, even the few sensible threads on there seem to quickly attract posts with one or two word sarcastic or incomprehensible replies, that's if you can find those threads among the crazy emoji posts!Edited: 4:22 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"No friends but no enemies either, which is nice. I don't spend as much time here as many and don't have the TA credentials of most; but that's because a previous incarnation of myself (who contributed hugely) was unaccountably banned for posting ""false"" reviews, which I never, ever did."
"{incomprehensible replies, that's if you can find those threads among the crazy emoji posts}thanks #90... yes that was my impression as well. i admit i didn't stick around long to try to work things out."
"I'm sure if I could meet up with some of the people on this forum we would become friends. There seem to be so many people with similar ideas. At the moment some seem more like pen-pals. Hopefully we will still be in touch when the forums return to ""normal"". Actually it is my hope that this forum will stay whatever happens."
"mollets.I'm pretty sure this forum will stay. After all, the Help Us Make TA Better (HUMTAB) forum is still alive and well, even though TA have yet to act on any of the suggestions members helpfully submit. It is actually totally redundant and has been for years.Edited: 5:56 am, July 23, 2020 "
"Some names become familiar, but not necessarily friends. Would love to get to know people better though."
"There’s a small, private group on Facebook I belong to made up of people who first “met” here, and I’ve become very good friends with one of them. We’ve met up twice, once in Mexico and once in the U.S. I’m very grateful to TripAdvisor for bringing us together!"
"J&D, do not worry - you are not at risk of becoming a “friend” to many of us on TA."
"J&D.The strange thing is you were only telling us on a fairly recent post how many friends you have on TA! I expect you think your army of followers are your friends?Edited: 10:46 am, July 23, 2020 "
"TravellerI think you were most likely referring to Post #284 in this threadhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i…where J&D said""Just keep contributing with reviews and especially photos. You'll soon make fantastic real friendships from all over the world and have many TA friends. Especially do reviews and post pictures on low reviewed places to get points, It is sorta like baseball card commons, Commons like Eiffel tower, London bridge, Disney land, and highly visited resorts get very little views and buried in new reviews quickly. Rares that get little reviews get the most views because they stay visible to the public for months sometimes years"""
FFM.I was indeed. Thanks for that.
"Folk, block one more reposter: “wise”. He has just infested my photos."
"{How can you make friends with completely anonymous people?}Not here in the Lounge, but in the Destination Forums you can get to know people from their posts, then get to know them better using the Personal Mail feature behind the scenes. Then you can even meet up in person, if you are in the same place at the same time. I have made friends that way many times over. Mostly in Puerto Vallarta, but occasionally for Hawaii or at home in Seattle when someone I know from a forum visits town we have lunch."

"My most recent date was an interesting person from California, we first ""met"" on the Hawaii forums, kept in touch, and later had lunch when they were in Seattle. You need to be open and willing.

Thanks you Mr Troll for bring this near enough back in line with where it should have been
"Noticed something very interesting. When you click on someone’s followers, go into their profile, you hit the three little dots, and block them comes up. My question is can you block someone else’s followers. Not that I’m going to...just wondering."
"A-S #111,If they are following you, then from your Profile, you can.However, if looking at someone else’s followers, I do not believe you can - but considering that this is TA, maybe one can??Hunt"
"Mr troll started following me today, but he went on vacation, so our friendship didn't last too long."
"That why I was asking, noticed he was following someone. He followed me as well as others the other day, under various names (very disturbing names)."
HuntYou can block any user by going to their profile page and blocking then as you would do if some one following you - better very often t be reactive rather than proactivehttps:/…200613547I have PM some people who I notice a troll is following as they may not have noticed and the more that report them the quicker they are shut down. If it is a troll account as well as blocking them I will also report the profile to TA
"Mr troll had some insight into the troll. He said that there is more than one troll and ""none of them are the poor geezer they bullied from nj."""
"FFM, If someone is following me, do they get notifications when I post something? If yes, why is it that regular posters are having difficulty with getting thread notifications? Or are the trolls also experiencing TA problems?"
"I don’t let people follow me, with a few exceptions. I block them as soon as they try."
"FFM #115,So, what you are saying is that I can go to someone else’s Profile, look at their Followers, and block them from following that other member?That certainly sounds rather odd, and likely destructive, but then, this is TA, so why would I be surprised, if you are correct?Hunt"
"""what you are saying is that I can go to someone else’s Profile, look at their Followers, and block them from following that other member?""That sounds invasive and wrong, on TA or anywhere else. Is there a reason for anybody to go to someone else's profile and decide to block that person's follower(s)?"
"Ok, sorry I brought that up. I went into someone’s profile today because the troll was following some of us. Wanted to see if he was still doing that. Otherwise I don’t usually go into someone’s profile and look at their followers. They still had one following."
"In fact, let’s just forget this...it’s something I should not have asked."
"J&D, My favorite posts are the ones that make me laugh."
"I always block unwanted and uninvited followers as well as all the friends of overzealous reposters, like someone we know. If I get helpful votes on my reposted reviews or photos, I block those “admirers”. This is the only way to get rid of them. I also proactively block posters I do not like. They present no interest to me."
Sorry for not being clearer - you can block anyone you want *for your part* but you can't block anyone on someone else's behalf. If you want to block someone they don't have to be your follower in order for you to do that. Just go to any person's profile and block.
Correct you can only block someone who is following you or block them from following you you have no control over who else they may be following
"""FFM, If someone is following me, do they get notifications when I post something?""No they don't for forum posts"

"Default,Obviously, you are NOT making friends here, but I suspect that such has been going on for many years, and in most places. Is that correct?Just observing,Hunt"
"J&D #131,Sorry, but I must be missing something here.Would you please articulate?TIA,Hunt"
Like Hunt I must be missing something as well as I see much more fun and humour on here than negativityEven the trolls activities and some weird posts from the odd user (sorry about the pun) does not get us downAll in all is is a very upbeat forum and as with any other forum on TA no one is forcing anyone to take part
