"No need to be so rude, they don't need that sort of answe."
"no problems with the corna virus in Phuket.We have water rationing, but that won't affect the hotels because they have water storage enough to tide (pun intended) them over the cut off periods.It's also hot and no rain to speak of for the past 10 days.Edited: 2:51 am, February 16, 2020 "
"And we don't need the constant trolling either.Seriously...........nobody, hopefully, is so F'g stupid, that they are seriously worried about Corona. 4 people outside of China, probably on their last leg anyway have died.STOP THE PRESSESOpen TA, and there's 5 more idiot virus posts, all 1 & 2 posts wonder. First page on the site is Corona, and 1/3 to 1/2 are, Corona, with about 25+ active threads, on first 3 pages, and just as many already closed.Starting to get tiresome. F' em....have no respect for trolls"

"So what , its words on a screen,, get over yourselves ,,"
Oh well. No point in any of us squabbling anyway as the OP would have had to make their own decision (heaven forbid) and either proceeded or cancelled by now.
"If you were contaminated with Wuhan Virus the symptoms might not show up for 2 weeks. Many tourists from India are only in Thailand for 4 to 8 nights. So, you could return home and because of poor sanitation possibly contribute to infecting over a billion people. (Sanitation in Thailand is much better than India.)* Check with your public health officials and ask if they can handle a major virus infection.Up to you."
Well said Infidelal and dead accurate.
