"Hello AllI had a call from Virgin today, who confirmed, they will not allow anybody to board who does not have proof of a negative Covid test. To be clear no test = no boarding.Seems safer to me.......but do worry about getting results back in time!!"
"Very reassuring news sainsmudger, thanks for that. I hope everyone can get their tests ok."
I am over the moon to hear this! I was also told this last week when I called but I’m unsure why it hasn’t been announced yet
"Thank you saintsmudger. Did they say anything to you about people who might have had their tests but the results have not come through yet? This has been quite a problem in the UK but if it was not a problem at the weekend then this is good news. A Saturday flight is OK for time to get test results, but a Tuesday flight for example would be very tricky, working the 72 hours back to include a Sunday in particular (when many are not working).If not, I will make a few calls myself. I have people coming in on Virgin in few weeks."
"First thing I did was check the current policy of Virgin online https:/…travel-restricitions.html Now yes it says: ""Proof of a negative COVID-19 will need to be shown to airport teams before a customer is permitted to check-in or board the plane""But then in the next para it states: ""Customers who do not present proof of a negative COVID-19 test at the departure airport will be required to take a test upon arrival in BGI. Please note this could take up to 12 hours to carry out.""If no one knows for sure on here, I will now try to find out the exact current position - but as you can see, that pair of wordings taken all together does NOT mean there will be only customers on board who have negative cetificates."
"According to some reports , on this forum and elsewhere ... the NHS labs are working over the weekend ...so no delay in getting your resultsSomeone called the NHS enquiry number and they apparently confirmed this"
"#4. The VA website has been like that for ages, really annoying that they cannot clarify ."
"Virgin can change their own 'rules' to apply only the first paragraph ... and advise the customer accordingly ..,which they appear to have doneI am sure somewhere they will have a term that says we can change these T&Cs at will !!!"
"I did ask to be very clear and answer was, that Virgin had taken this stance alone, even though you could be tested in Barbados.Funny that I have been trying to speak to someone from Virgin for soooooo long but reassured that they are now engaging with their customers."
"Just to remind everyone, there is no guarantee anywhere in the UK that you will obtain a 72 hour test result that you can have available at the airport in time for your flight which obeys the rules of entry to Barbados. Even if some in the UK are working weekends, there is simply no guarantee and I have had this confirmed on several occasions. If anyone knows a place (NHS or otherwise) where they GUARANTEE that you will get your results within 72 hours I would be interested to hear of them. Otherwise it's just hopeful conjecture."
"Saintsmudger, can I ask how you got to speak to them please? Have an urgent question before we pay our balance in couple of weeks."
"Hi Chrissie, I have called virgin numerous times in the past couple of weeks and I have never struggled or waited long to get through to speak to someone. I would suggest calling their customer service line as early as possible, their lines open at 7am"
Thanks
"I now have people coming out on the Virgin flight in two weeks so I called my own contacts (two different people) and they have told me that the rule on the website stands. The advice is to obtain a Covid19 test before flying but if you are unable to get one, then you can fly and you can have it in Barbados. Both my contacts have confirmed that travellers are not stopped from flying if they do not have their tests available. As the PM of Barbados made clear last night, the airlines are not having any involvement in the testing, and the Barbados government is clear that we have the capacity and ability here to test and re-test if necessary. That having been said, I strongly suggest you get the test done in the UK. It will save you a lot of time and aggro."
"Joe V, I have just received an email from Virgin stating the following:Hello We have tried to get in touch regarding your upcoming flight to Barbados with us. We want to make sure you are aware, on behalf of the Bajan authorities that it is now mandatory to complete and pass a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours of the flight departure time. NHS tests are accepted and you must ensure you have adequate accompanying paperwork showing proof of a negative test with the time and date clearly visible – no text messages will be permitted. You must have this paperwork available when you arrive at London Heathrow for our airport teams.When within 24 hours before departure, you can also submit your results and complete the ED form at https://travelform.gov.bb/home. To read more about the current COVID-19 Travel restrictions for Barbados please follow the link to our website: https:/…travel-restricitions.html and the latest government advice at https:/…barbados.If you are unable to comply with the testing requirement you do have the option to change your ticket dates (fare difference may apply) or leave your ticket open with us to use any time until 30th September 2022. If you wish to contact us to discuss the options available to you our messaging team can help with most things, including secure payments. Drop us a text on +44 (0)7481 339184, or 97634 from the US. You can also WhatsApp us on +44 (0)344 8747747. Just save our number in your mobile to get started and search for us in the WhatsApp application. Kind Regards,"
Surely if you present a negative test taken within 72 hours of departure there is no benefit in wearing a mask for the duration of the flight especially on the more spacious UC.
"Bit concerned if they don’t take text results, I work for nhs and my and my husbands test results have been only by text"
"#14 Beautiful Tee - that is very helpful to post that and it is a clever way of the airline to phrase it. It gives max encouragement to UK tourists to have the test. If you read it though you will see that it does not anywhere say that it is obligatory to have the test and that you cannot have it in Barbados. Virgin are quite clever at wordings in terms of stuff like that (and I am pleased about this one really), but it nowhere says that if you have not had your test you will not be allowed on board. For example it says ""if you are unble to comply ...you have the option to change your ticket or..."". But it cleverly does not give you the third further 'other option' - to fly without having had a test. This artful wording was used when trying to get refunds in April and May, for example, when people called - ""you have these options, schedule another date, or keep a ticket on hold till 2022. Which would you like Sir""...ignoring offering the other one which was highly inconvenient - ""Would you like your money back?"". It is a standard sales practice to divert you from the option they do NOT want you to take.But this wording is helpful to base another enquiry on. Although I have had it confirmed twice by different sources that my clients CAN fly on Virgin from the UK and have tests in Barbados (not that they want to but that they might HAVE to when/if the UK ones fail to come through), I nonetheless will folllow the process and the message you referred to and come back to the forum.Again, I do not want people to fly without tests, especially now that we can get them free on the NHS. But we do have to accept that test results will at times not come through and the Barbados government has acknowledged that by firmly re-iterating that people arriving can have the test done on landing. To not allow for this will result in far more anger from missed flights, and possible lack of compensation through no fault of the customer's own (eg accommodation telling you you have lost your money as a no-show, which has happened and is often at the discretion of the host). Again I append the current rules at 7th August 2020 which state quite clearly on the Virgin Atlantic website that you can fly to Barbados and have the test done there. https:/…travel-restricitions.htmlEdited: 6:13 pm, August 07, 2020 "
BTee and JoeV. Thanks for clarification but is it any wonder people are confused and repeatedly asking questions !
You’re welcome Chrissie and yes it is extremely confusing. I have just checked in and I agree with Joe V that it is just artful wording as I saw passengers without proof of a negative test checking in.
"JohnF ..are you talking about the whole UC cabin ...or just individuals Given that tests may have not been done correctly, that no test is 100% and the variable infectious period ..I am not sure I would fly without a mask or be happy with others not doing so ......especially for 8+ hours"
Beautiful Tee ...have a good and safe flight ...please do let us know how you got onI guess you got your test results in time ...was it NHS or private ???
"mdp I agree to a point. What I am saying though if everyone on the plane especially in the more spacious UC, have tested negative for the virus then surely the risk is minimal enough to remove the other precautions. Just a suggestion in my desire to return to normality and get on enjoying life."
"John F the point as per posts 17 and 19 is that possibly not everyone will have been tested or got their results before flying,"
"Thank you mdp, yes I done the nhs test on the Wednesday afternoon and received my results after 24 hours. The queue was really long at arrivals for passengers with test results so I’m assuming the majority of the plane had taken tests"
"Beautiful TreeThank you for the update, which I am sure will reassure many of us that are flying soon.Disappointed if the Gent I spoke to at Virgin mislead me!!! Have a Rum for me x"
"I contacted virgin and was reassured by same answer and then checked website- Customers must complete a COVID-19 test (PCR test) within 72 hours of their scheduled departure time. Proof of a negative COVID-19 will need to be shown to airport teams before a customer is permitted to check-in or board the plane. Please note that the COVID-19 negative test result must have the date and time it was taken clearly shown.Customers who do not present proof of a negative COVID-19 test at the departure airport will be required to take a test upon arrival in BGI. Please note this could take up to 12 hours to carry outSo how does MUST COMPLETE become CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT?2 positive passengers on Virgin flight this weekend. So if within 4 rows, I’d end up quarantined. Won’t be risking it until Virgin do actually insist on it for all passengers."
"If the UK became a high-risk country (and therefore quarantine guaranteed on arrival to Barbados), would Virgin pull the flights? Surely they wouldn't drop off in Barbados knowing their passengers would be forced into quarantine. We're booked for 7 days in Nov."
