"The local government seems to be seriously enforcing the beach closures , especially since theconfirmation of two case of the Corona virus on the island.https:/â€¦2020.html"
wow. incredible. sam
I'm sorry for my friends but I'm happy they are enforcing it.
I think it's a good thing. People don't need to go to the beach right now. I get how some people think it's okay because there won't be that many people thete. But if everyone thinks that then social distancing becomes impossible. I know it's boring and we all want to get out and enjoy the weather but really going to the beach isn't a reason to leave your home.
"I'm not looking to start any arguments here or anything like that, but the official word we are getting in New Hampshire and Maine is to go out and exercise, while maintaining social distance. Fishing is free in nearby Maine for the next month, no license needed. They are saying to have Plan B and Plan C ready. If you plan to go hiking, and the trail head is full of cars, well go to another trail head. If the beach parking lot is empty, enjoy it, if it is full go elsewhere. Exercise is recognized as an essential activity. And if you are distanced from other people, where is the risk. That being said, various activities do not have any rangers on patrol, so if you are injured hiking, for example, rescue may well take longer."
"Interesting, TM. I have sometimes thought the restriction of outdoor activities went a bit overboard. I understand the spacing is necessary but that can be done outdoors as well as indoors.Thanks for the post."
"The issue we have up here is with (some) skiers. All the resorts have closed down, but you can still come in and ""skin"" up the hill, or snowshoe and change over to skis and ski down. Just maintain social distance, lots of room and fresh air out there. But what they are doing is hiking up, getting a ski run in, then congregating on the decks and near fire rings, actually firing them up in some cases, and not maintaining social distance. That is where it becomes a problem. So one resort shutters it's gate, then you have fewer and fewer ski resorts allowing it and everyone goes to them. then another shuts down and they crowd out the remaining even more, etc.... Pretty much, they are all closed down now. all because, some feel the need to crowd up an area...Most of all, you gotta be smart....."
"TM, I am in agreement. Exercise supports a strong immune system.And for those that separate, this should not be an issue. It is no different than being in your backyard doing things. Especially in Cozumel where the yards are small and have a lot of hard surfaces where the winds can carry things to your neighbors."
