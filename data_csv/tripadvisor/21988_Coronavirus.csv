We are booked on a Noble Caledonia Trans Siberian Rail tour from London-Moscow-Vladivostok-Seoul-London from 3 - 18 May. The Government advice is getting more and more pessimistic about the areas we will be travelling through. I would be interested to hear the views of anybody who is either on that tour on one similar as to what they plan to do about proceeding!Bryan
"There have been a growing number of posts on this topic...suggest reading thru them, though the title may not specify coronavirus. As for ""the areas you will be traveling thru"", while yes Siberia and Far East regions are ""closer"" to China, the bigger worries so far are more European cities, and per a number of reports, there may have been a recent crackdown for TOURISTS coming in from ""effected countries"" which is now up to 11 or so with addition of US...expect in short-order that most the EU will get onto the list. BUT, you really should be addressing these questions to the tour operator...THEY have to update you on developments thereEdited: 12:38 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"“now up to 11 or so with addition of US...The situation develops very fast. So far, the self quarantine requirement does not affect tourists coming from the U.S. I posted this in other thread below.The U.S is NOT on the list of worst-affected counties, travelers coming from which must be self isolated. As of March 9, People entering the capital from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain are required to stay inside for two weeks. All previous press report misinterpreted the official statement, as of today the U.S, UK, Norway and Switzerland are not on the list.https://m.interfax.ru/698219Edited: 1:57 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Give it a little more time Brymac. The number of new cases in China and South Korea is dropping daily now, and more and more Chinese are returning to work. The Italians are taking the brunt of it right now, but that will pass too - the average age of those dying of the virus in Italy right now is 81 - Italy having the oldest population in Europe, I've heard on the BBC.Good luck"
"#2 - initially, was very glad, BUT...the ""clarifying"" statement from the Interfax news agenct (the ink) is quite self contradictory...it starts well enough saying the self-quarantine would apply only to more serious countries (для прибывших в Москву из Китая, Южной Кореи, Италии, Ирана, Франции, Германии и Испании) - that is 7, but then goes right on to say ""as well as other countries with unfavorable situations ("" a также других государств с неблагополучной ситуацией"", ending with...drum roll...that is, countries included in the list of 11...and voila, we are right back where we started from...that is 7 serious ones, + 4 = 11. Unless I am misinterpreting.Bottom line...this all remains to me quite confusing, and have yet to see a clear original statement posted on the Russian Consumer Protection Agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, local embassy, or the Mayor's office...Edited: 7:46 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Ebertsj, I think we need to sit back for a couple weeks and see what direction this all leads. You have 2 months before your trip ( I have 1.5 months), within a month I am sure things will be much clearer."
"I hope so...and will be waiting - just trying to get first hand reports (as you no doubt have read)...it is AMAZING that despite so many reports have not found official statements...and am quite used to tracking these things down...and usually Russians are quite good at putting out such formal statements...needless to say watching my Russian news and talk shows does not help much as while they are massively covering this, no word about tourists...Keeping fingers crossed...and surely hope you make it fine too!"
Some sanity to the hysteria...…https:/…from aeolis:https:/…
"""All previous press report misinterpreted the official statement, as of today the U.S, UK, Norway and Switzerland are not on the list.""Time for a reality check, this is a rapidly evolving situation where the entire nation of Italy has closed its borders and is completely quarantined.What is happening in Western Europe and the US is happening at an exponential pace. One needs to forget the numbers, but look at the rate of change.Since last Friday, most EU Nations have seen increases in cases of 200 - 300% over the last 5 days.Friday the US was 234, today the the US is now at 729, an increase in cases of 212%. At this rate the US are likely to go past 1000 in the next 2 days when you consider Spain, Germany and France have all exceeded 1,200. Other EU nations are all now in the 100's.Japan is starting to see a slow down, along with South Korea and Iran, but this has taken extreme authoritarian measures.Italy have now taken extreme measures, and France are increasing the bans on mass gatherings. The US is starting to cancel major events, but whether the US is willing to take on the measures introduced in China, South Korea, Japan and now Italy is yet to be seen.The issue with travel through Eastern Europe and Asia is going to be less about the risk there, but whether entry will be allowed for those on passports from the West.The WHO are now starting to use the P word, and that this is now a Pandemic with Global Markets crashing.US citizens are being advised to consider whether overseas travel is necessary and to avoid Cruises all together.South America, South Africa and the South Pacific and India and Sri Lanka are the safest destinations at this very point in time, but who they let in will be the challenge.Hope that things will improve is great, and China is providing a glimmer of hope, but for China this started in December and took extreme measures to bring a halt to the spread.Edited: 5:36 am, March 10, 2020 "
"Amen, Eugene. But you can’t argue with people who cite RT and NY Post, two propaganda mills. Until the President says, it’s a problem, they’ll insist that COVID-19 is just a bad flu."
"Re #8...if you speak and read Russian, it is hilarious to me that even the “retraction” of whether it is 11 countries or 7 contradicts itself...saying at first “no, only 7 countries where the situation is really bad have stricter 14 day self-isolation, then, after a reference to some vague people - BUT NO LINK TO A STATEMENT ON AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT WEB SITE (I am checking daily 4 or so) - goes on to repeat this BUT ADDS BACK IN THE PHRASE “and other countries deemed to have unfavorable situations...and, bang, right back to 11...Indeed, this will get worse in the US and Russia before it gets better...and agree 100% (if not more) that we are all going to have to wait and see how each country reacts. Just for fun, and will share the response, have contacted my hotel (part of the I think the world’s largest chain with folks I know well who have always been reliable) to ask what they are hearing locally “on the ground” because CLEARLY if and when it does get to asking tourists to lock themselves up in their rooms, surely, they would have to be informed...will share when I get a response, but agree things can and will change..."
">drum roll...that is, countries included in the list of 11...and voila, we are right back where we started from...that is 7 serious ones, + 4 = 11. Unless I am misinterpreting.Re. #4: Called the official hotline. They confirmed that, as of now people entering from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain are required to stay inside for two weeks. People coming from the U.S, UK, Norway and Switzerland are not required to be self isolated for 14 days.Edited: 2:57 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"""They confirmed that, as of now people entering from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain are required to stay inside for two weeks.""You keep going on that U.S, UK, Norway and Switzerland are not, but not more than a week ago, France, Germany and Spain weren't on the list. France, Germany and Spain are on the list now with cases now 1,784, 1,458 and 1,678 with Italy now passing 10,000.The US is already closing in on 800 at 788 and Switzerland about to hit 500 at 497, so getting complacent about these nations is false hope for those looking to travel in April or May, or maybe even two weeks. If the threshold for self isolation is a 1000 cases, the US will be there before the week is out.Not being on the list as at today is far from any assurance you won't be at risk of self isolation in the near future.Those in the UK may have more hope as numbers have slowed there at only 373, maybe helped by BREXIT and being an island nation. Japan has also slowed drastically but still at 581. I cancelled our trip to Japan when it hit 50, which wasn't long ago."
>Not being on the list as at today is far from any assurance you won't be at risk of self isolation in the near future.Totally agree. The situation develops so rapidly.
"#12 - agree 100%...and am getting tired of hearing all this (and as I said, even the CORRECTION contradicted itself when to date, NO ONE has been able to point me or us to the ORIGINAL, FORMAL government statement...and Russia is VERY formal about this kind of stuff, and almost always have a 1-2 page official doc from the relevant authority (and here, appears there is a lit of some 8-10 with authority to issue such orders!) with SPECIFICS...and even here, called, talked to someone, especially when indeed things are changing by the minute! Sigh...I am ""lucky"" in that my trip is some 2 months out..."
".I am ""lucky"" in that my trip is some 2 months out...I do empathise with you as I was in the same situation, but my hand was forced early as I was taking my mother for her last overseas trip, and I chose Tokyo as it is a fascinating city, steeped in history, easy to travel (not too dissimilar to Moscow, which would have been my pick if closer) but she is 82, has diabetes and a genetic respiratory condition , so when Japan hit 50 cases and started cancelling large gathering, cancelling was a no brainer.All going well, have transferred the trip to Noumea for a bit of French Culture in the South Pacific and still CONVID-19 free. Fingers tightly crossed as fly out in 29 days......"
"#14 You may want to check out this site as it would appear that I was being overly optimistic that the US may break 1,000 case before the week is out, it is looking more like before the day is out having already hit 971, with 4 new deaths for a total of 30.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Sorry, the only upside is seeing what kind of spin that Orange Clown in charge comes up with when the US hits 1,000, where back when the US was only 14 cases he was stating the figure would come down, to almost nothing and the whole thing would disappear in April when it gets warm. Guess the Orange Clown doesn't realise that there are two hemispheres and while it's getting warm in the north it's getting cold in the south, being the stable genius that he is."
