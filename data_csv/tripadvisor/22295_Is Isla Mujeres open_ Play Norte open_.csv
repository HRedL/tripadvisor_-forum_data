"Is Isla Mujeres open? Play Norte open?Also, are the following open: Oaxaca? Puebla? CDMX? Guanajuato? Where could I find a constantly updated list of places open to travelers?Thank you!"
"You can travel to IM, but all beaches are officially closed while under the Orange epidemiological risk colour code."
And there's still much that is closed on Isla Mujeres. Nowhere near all the restaurants are open and many vendors haven't reopened yet either.
"Oaxaca is now orange. Mexico City stayed at orange. Puebla stayed at red and Guanajuato changed back to red.This link gives you the complete federal list:https:/…Edited: 9:15 pm, July 18, 2020 "
"Here's the updated list for the week beginning 20 July....""Red"" states: Baja California Sur, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz, Yucatán, Quintana Roo and Oaxaca.""Orange"" states: Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, Aguascalientes, Michoacán, Guerrero, México state, Mexico City, Morelos, Tlaxcala, Chiapas and Campeche.Note: the above colour codes are assigned by the FEDERAL government, but STATE governments can assign a different colour based on their own system. For example, Quintana Roo is deemed Red by the federal government, but the northern municipalities of QR have been deemed Orange by the state government.Edited: 2:35 pm, July 19, 2020 "
"Even though you asked about Isla Mujeres and not Playa del Carmen, I thought I'd post that the beaches in Playa del Carmen are now closed to the public again. it may be of some interest to you or someone else on here.They had been open but apparently people weren't observing the Covid protocols so they removed them from the beach under threat of 36 hours in jail. In today's Por Esto translated:https://translate.google.com/translate…"
I was there this morning when the police put the yellow tape in place to block access. Some people were already on the beach and were told to leave. Also no beach access from beach clubs or hotels (at least today).
"Too bad really that some people couldn't comply and ruined it for everyone. But, that's the way of the world these days. Honestly, I don't expect the beaches to be open to the public here in Q. Roo for a while. I was hoping by August but I think that's nothing but a pipe dream now. We're scheduled to go back to Isla on August 29 until September 7 and I think while we might not be the only ones in our hotel like last time, I don't think we'll have much company either. If we didn't live so close, I'm not sure I'd spend the airfare to go under the current situation."
"At least we got a couple of weeks of beach time. It was fun while it lasted.Edited: 12:13 am, July 20, 2020 "
">> ""Where could I find a constantly updated list of places open to travelers?""Meanwhile, back to the original post...I check media resources every day. The federal government's announcements have been made on Fridays, and are usually published on Friday or Saturday on Mexico News Daily...https://mexiconewsdaily.com/In future, announcements could be every 2 weeks.In the state of Quintana Roo, the state government's decision takes priority over the federal. The state government makes their announcememt every Thursday evening, and it's published here...https://reactivemosq.roo.gob.mx/I'm not interested in other states. You could ask on the separate forums for Oaxaca, Puebla, CDMX, and Guanajuato."
