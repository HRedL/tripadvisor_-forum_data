I read there was an official ban on those from the US. Do you know how long this restriction is for at this time? I had a flight booked from the US to Tokyo for which I was able to receive a refund. I still have a flight from Tokyo to Osaka for May 10 and the return flight to Tokyo on May 15. I still have not been able to reach anyone at Japan air to ask for refunds. If there is a definite travel restriction in place for those from the US my bank will accept my dispute.

"You might try this webpage:https:/…It's unclear whether JAL will consider your Tokyo-Osaka-Tokyo tickets to be ""international,"" but you could try the form on that webpage and see what happens. (Their English is sometimes unclear, so be patient and use your imagination!)"
"The ban does not have a specific lift date. It is uncertain. US has a very bad situation right now, I don't think the ban will be lifted anytime soon.There's a very slim chance of the ban being lifted on your travel date.If your trip is non-essential, just stay home.Edited: 7:12 am, April 13, 2020 "
"CarterStrife 7, of course, FanzofTA will cancel their trip. She already got refund for their flights to Japan, The question is about how to get refunds of their domestic flights in Japan."

How much testing is happening in Japan now that the Olympics have been moved to 2021 Summer?

"Michael, FanzofTA are old folks who are just trying to get their refunds of their airfares in Japan. Not planning to travel Japan any more yet."
"@jordansbulls - not much additional testing - still severely limited criteria. More bizarre is that everyone that tested positive was being confined to hospital, so they had something like 500 mostly healthy people using up space in Tokyo for a while. Now those are being moved to a hotel and freeing up beds. There are a growing number of people (and ambulances) being turned away from hospitals (partly because of that policy)."
"The law requires carriers of COVID 19 to be isolated. If you call it ""bizarrre, "" how should they be deal with, JapanCustomTours?"
"""@jordansbulls - not much additional testing - still severely limited criteria.""I guess my real question is, is any country in the world really capable of doing the testing and having the hospital beds for the cases they could probably have? I would assume not."
I guess South Korea is doing a great job on that.They are efficiently using other accomodations for the mild symptom patients from the early stage.
"It’s frustrating that no one at Japan airlines or CheapOAir, with whom we booked the flights between Tokyo and Osaka, can be reached by phone. We are now exactly 14 days when we are to arrive in Tokyo. There are travel bans from those from the US, as well as a long list of other countries. How can our tickets be valid and we not be given refunds when the situation is not within our control? Posted fir days now, and updated today on April 24, on Japan.travel website is the following:Measures by the Government of Japan 1. Areas subjected to entry banForeign nationals categorized below are denied permission to enter Japan for the time being, unless there are exceptional circumstances.(1) Foreign nationals who have stayed in any of the areas listed in the following table within 14 days prior to the application for landing. ... the long list includes the United States"
"Hi, FanzofTA!!Welcome back to the forum.Didn't you try the link that Dave148 gave at #5?Edited: 5:14 pm, April 24, 2020 "
Did you try below?https:/…support-form
"@Global ""The law requires carriers of COVID 19 to be isolated.""Is there a reference for that you could link to - I'm curious of the actual statute, or is it promulgated by regulation/guideline?They do not have to be isolated in a hospital - the costs of bed occupancy, even with no treatment is very high and a poor use of resources. As they ""discovered"", using a hotel works, and isolating in their own homes would also suffice. There are other/different approaches used around the world."
"JCT, my goodness, I thought you were going to comment on how she could get a refund.Japan has its own law.loc.gov/law/…Now they made amendments and actually when the patients only have mild symptoms, they are staying at some hotels. First they couldn't foresee that they would be so much patients, I guess. Isolation at their own homes turned out not to be suffice, because two single guys died in Saitama who were on the waiting list for the hospital beds. The Ministry demands them to be in hotel rooms where they can contact nurses when they started to have troubles and prevent infections spreading among the family members.Macau is one of the most successful ones in containing it, but also South Korea is doing a great job where they constructed a systematic method to triage the patients being prepared after the SARS.There isn't enough hospital beds in Saitama that medical collapse is starting there.Edited: 7:23 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"""There isn't enough hospital beds in Saitama that medical collapse is starting there.""Tough to see. In reality now that it is out it seems tough to believe it took a long time for something like this to happen. You would think the world would have been better prepared with the technology it has."
"Well, so the Ministry changed policy from asking the patients with mild symptom to be put in facilities instead of asking to wait at home.The tough reality that even a famous actress (63) died within three weeks after she was hospitalized. It was hard to believe because I could only remember her full of cheerfulness, Genki. she was. Some people are saying if she got medical care earlier, instead spending the first three days at home, and been prescribed Avigan, maybe she could have been alive. Don't get it wrong. Still the total number of death from COVID 19 in Japan is 328, much less than the number of people dying in the US in a single day. The population of the US is three times of that of Japan. We are grateful for the healthcare workers saving a lot of lives.  I hope all the numbers decrease all over the world soon.Edited: 1:08 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Interesting to hear about Japan's approach. In the UK, people are told to stay at home with so-called mild symptoms and the threshold for admission to hospital is very high. Consequently, once people arrive at hospital they are critically ill and only 50% of people who enter intensive care survive. The other day I read an interesting article (by a doctor) in which it was suggested that the problem is that people's oxygen levels are falling without them realising until they suddenly collapse with dangerously low oxygen levels. I suspect that that's why we are hearing reports of people dying at home and ambulances arriving too late to save them. In my admittedly inexpert opinion, perhaps everyone with suspected symptoms should be monitored at home, say on days 3, 5 and 8 of the infection, so that drops in oxygen levels can be picked up and treated before the person becomes dangerously ill. There's a lot of emphasis on developing a vaccine but unless and until a comprehensive vaccination programme is rolled out and people actually are vaccinated (not a given as there is increasing vaccine refusal and hesitancy) better treatments (in the broadest sense) for this disease need to be found urgently. Anyway, sorry if this post is not really appropriate for a travel forum. Hope everyone remains well."
"Sorry hijacking your thread FanzofTA, but I believe everybody share the concerns when we can travel again.AJM, thank you for your explanation. I was wondering why 19,506 people died just in the past few months. Even Mr. Johnson got critical after staying home for a while, so that approach seems to be turning out risky.The patients must be able to be kept at places where nurse/doctor calls are possible immediately when necessary before it becomes too late to recover. Some hotels after the requests from the local governments are cooperating to accomodate mild symptom patients with nurses' checking daily conditon of the sick and the local governments are trying to secure more rooms.Avigan seems to be working quite well for the patients at the earlier stage in Japan.Let's hope covidiots will decrease and researchers will find a solution to this pandemic."
"Thank you for your reply. To illustrate the points that I made in my earlier post, someone that I know of was not classed as (sufficiently) breathless because he could still talk in full sentences and so he was not admitted to hospital. Subsequently, when he was virtually 'moribund' (my friend's choice of word) he was taken into intensive care and put on ventilation. Happily he survived but it was touch and go. I believe that he was in hospital for a fortnight. At the start of this pandemic the government was very worried that the health system would be overwhelmed and so the advice was to stay at home and not to turn up at hospital or at your local GP surgery. GPs don't seem to be doing home visits to patients who are displaying symptoms of Covid 19 but I'm not absolutely sure about that. There is a shortage of Personal Protective Equipment in the UK which may well be a factor."
"Maybe the Japanese customs of taking off shoes at the entrance of houses are one of the reasons keeping our death rate lower than the Western countries. You can change to slippers or clean shoes once you get home. Even if you have virus on your shoes, you can leave them at your entrance instead of spreading them all over your place."
"@Global - thanks for that. Of course Japan has its own laws and regs, and different ways of doing things. I haven't used that particular website for about a year. I do recall the amendments to the IDP Act and (along the lines of the discussion being about changing from a potential influenza pandemic to cover covid-19), Quarantine Act, but I had not picked up the ""mandatory hospitalization of patients"".And yes - apologies to the OP for diverting the original subject of the thread. I am not aware of an enforceable travel restriction that prevents JAL (or ANA) from flying domestically so the fare conditions of the ticket would normally apply. If they change the schedule, then that could trigger the right for a refund, but both main carriers are still flying planes around the country (although many less than usual - around 200 in the air at the moment on the usual flight radar view I normally use - less than half the numbers of a couple of weeks ago.)"
"Please refer to Article 19 and 20.www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/…I haven't checked the actual law till now, but it has ""may"" not ""must."" I remember one of the doctors who is working at Disease and Control Center, top institute in Japan on infectious diseases, complained that mild symptom patients were taking up their beds for sometimes more than three weeks because the law restrictions on a TV news program in February. The bindments sounded so stronng that the governors seemed to be completely perplexed. This didn't happened for quite a while in Japan so they are a lot of trials and errors going on.I don't know about Cheap O Flights, but when you get discount tickets, the right of getting refund without cancellation of the actual flight might be lower, I believe. I don't understand why they got plane tickets instead of using the bullet trains, which is a unique Japanese experience."
Thank you for responding. I have followed up on your suggestions already and filled out the forms and sent emails. I have gotten no response. In the whole scheme of things the cost of the tickets is a small loss compared to what others are going through. Hope you are all staying safe.
It might take a littlle while till they get back to you.I'm glad you're OK. I hope you will stay safe too.
"Japan Custom Tours,The site below was much easier for me to understand.http://akkie.mods.jp/2019-nCoV/指定感染症とは%EF%BD%9C感染症法の解説I hope you can read some Japanese.BTW, can I ask when was the last tour you had?Tour companies won't cancel to the very last minute, so I was wondering when that was."
"@FanzofTA - refunds can take a while. Some of the people I deal with it's basically same day, other times I've had to wait almost three months. One of the recent cancellations for tickets I had (dance performance) was a paper system, post and I think it was around three weeks. Hopefully you'll get something back.@Global - last trip/tour was a fun week across the New Year for a family (Hiroshima/Kyoto/Tokyo). Our 2020 guests/tours were cancelled, refunded or shifted. The next one in August is looking doubtful as I don't expect visitors from the US will be allowed into Japan that soon. I have doubts about one we shifted to September as well - probably will postpone that one again to 2021 for those guests."
"""The next one in August is looking doubtful as I don't expect visitors from the US will be allowed into Japan that soon. ""That is a precaution it seems."
"Japan Custom Tours, could your business file for the support ""Jizoku . . .?"" I didn't know that you have American clients, I thought it was for Kiwis.Did you start a part time job?"
"Off topic - again.@Global - visitors from US, Canada, UK, Aussies and Kiwis - and a few others. We've had quite a variety of people visiting and looking around over the years. Still working and waiting for things to change - it'll take a while. Spending more time learning Japanese :)"
"Off topic but it matches the title.The original title should be ""How can I get refunds of JAL Domestic flight?"" I don't know the flight number but maybe their domestic flights were cancelled because of the low demand.Aren't you the business owner? Maybe you could get some fund from the Government. https:/…20200427003.htmlEdited: 12:42 am, April 30, 2020 "
