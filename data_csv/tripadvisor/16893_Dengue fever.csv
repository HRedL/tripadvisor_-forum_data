Will be traveling with small children and read some posts online regarding epidemic of Dengue? Thoughts? Are certain areas bad?
"Barbados has been fighting dengue fever for decades --- there is NO epidemic as Canby states -- in fact Barbados probably has less than some other countries owing to its strict program of vector control fogging., to minimize the breeding of Ades Agypti mosquitoes that carry the ""bad"" viruses"
"Barbados regularly fogs to reduce the mosquitos,,All tropical countries have mosquitos,but Barbados does not have an epidemic at all.I am especially susceptible to mosquito bites ,and from my last 3 visits have had only 3 or 4 bites ,thats when i forgot to use a repellant at night.So even with young children take measures to prevent bites ,use a deet spray on top of their sun screen,and apply ,after they have been in the water regularly"
Where did you read about the so called epidemic???Some media do print/report some real rubbish Consult your doctor as which is the best protection for children ...depends then on your personal views on the use of DEET ...which for most people is the most effective prevention
"I contracted Dengue Fever in Thailand 2yrs ago i was in hospital for 6 days my white blood cells were 150,000 and dropped to 76,000 and I felt as if I was going to die and at one point I felt so ill I wanted to die. My wife has booked a holiday in Holetown march 2019 and found out that Barbados has Dengue and am worried about going.Any feed back to make me look forward to visiting Barbados would be extremely grateful. Many thanks"
"Thousands of Bajans live in Barbados for their whole lives and never catch Dengue. Thousands of tourists visit Barbados once or twice a year and never catch Dengue. Barbados operates strict Governmental actions against mosquitoes , and most Hotels and good private rentals ""Fog"" weekly or even more , to ensure the breeding of mosquitos is kept to a minimum. We have had Dengue lurking for years, we had Chikengunya, and most recently Zika, but all three ( spread by the same type mosquito ) have been kept to minimum when compared with many other Caribbean Island.  Chik V was the worst in that it was new, and few were immune against it, but once caught, it could not be caught again ( even though it could return later in someone infected previously ) Once virtually everyone ( myself included ) had caught it, it died out . Zika was next and half the time showed little or no symptoms and that appears to be on the wain, if not gone, but Dengue is always lurking in the back ground. Just use plenty of mossie spray and take vitamin B6 daily before you go , and while you are on the Island. ( certainly works for me !! ) and get your room sprayed with BOP or something similar at night. Anyone taking precautions would have to be VERY unlucky to catch Dengue in Barbados."
"We have been wintering on the island for the past nearly 30 yrs (5-6 mths) - we have never caught dengue, zika, ChikV or anything else.As suggested use repellent (Off - Jungle Formula - etc) and treat your room /accommodation with insecticide, remember the Aedes Agypti mosquito that carries the bad viruses - does not bite just at dusk and dawn, it bites in the daytime !- so remember to respray after swimming etc. Also mosquitoes like to hide in dark places, so spray under the beds, in the clothes cupboard, under the furniture - No reason why you should catch anything. Enjoy your holiday ..."
"Aedes aegypti bites primarily during the day. This species is most active for approximately two hours after sunrise and several hours before sunset, but it can bite at night in well lit areas. This mosquito can bite people without being noticed because it approaches from behind and bites on the ankles and elbows.www.denguevirusnet.com/aedes-aegypti.html"
Because its not the rainy in march are you less likely to contract Dengue fever
Thankyou for your feedback interesting comments
"Hi, I was just wondering how your holiday went in the end and whether dengue was a concern for all of your holiday? My husband and I also contracted dengue in 2011 on holiday in Grenada and have avoided anywhere tropical since for fear of catching it again. We are considering a holiday to Barbados in July but are very concerned about catching it again, especially as we now have a small child. Any advice would be much appreciated."
"There’s still no outbreak, haven’t heard of anyone having it in a very long time. I most definitely wouldn’t let the very, very remote possibility of it put me off coming to Barbados on holiday! In fact, if you’ve ever had it before you’re now immune to that particular strain (there are only 4) so your chance of contracting is actually even more remote than most. I live here, my family live here, my little nieces and nephews live here and it’s not something any of us spend a second thinking about so I certainly don’t think it’s a real reason for anyone to stay away, especially since it’s years since there’s ever been a significant outbreak."
HI back home from my holiday from holetown Barbados safe and sound great place bitten a few times sprayed using deet also vic vapour rub on ankles heels elbows knees and feet. just use protection and you wiil be fine
"HI again if you use the vic vapour rub just dab on the bony areas, vic is a strong odour just a tiny amout is all you need."
The coast would be particular safe as mosquitos don't like it windy and the salt air
"There is always a small chance of getting dengue. There is no way to be 100% safe. Just like when I visit North America in the fall and winter months there is no way to 100% protect myself against the nasty flu viruses that circulate there (most of which don't circulate in Barbados, or not to the same extent). When I travel north on vacation there are many ways I can get sick (including Lyme disease that we don't even have in Barbados), but it doesn't stop me from going. That's part of the risk of travel."
