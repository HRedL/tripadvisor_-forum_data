Are there any reported cases of corona virus in or near Hoi An ?
"If the answer today is none, it could change within hours or days. I think you have to decide to go or not and if you do go to Hoi An, make sure to wash your hands often and/or use hand santiser and if need be, wear a mask."

"Untill now, Vietnam have 16 cases Long An, Nha Trang, Thanh Hoá, Vĩnh PhúcEdited: 3:19 am, February 14, 2020 "
"On 19th February, 15 of 16 patients have been discharged from the hospital. The last case is not near Hoi An. It is safe to travel to this town.Indochina Pioneer"
"We are currently in hoi an , lots of people wearing masks than not . We feel safe and we are British . Lots of Japanese in hoi an at the moment"
"""make sure to wash your hands often and/or use hand santiser""If I'm not mistaken, hand sanitizers are anti-bacterial. Which means they have zero effect on a virus like coronavirus. But then again face masks offer zero protection as well, and everyone is wearing them, so there you go. Logic and common sense are usually the first victims of herd mentality."
"Most anti-bacterial hand sanitizers have alcohol, which means they would work against a virus as well.That said, regular (non anti-bacterial) soap and water work just as well, and potentially better, since it's easier to ensure it gets everywhere on your hands when you scrub it with water, so it should only be used when soap/water is not an option.Edited: 12:02 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Looking for a Corona topic , is this the only one this forum ...."
Willem VThere are pages and pages of Coronavirus take your pick.
"Willem....... Just look at the forum, there is one with over 700 posts. Not a lot that can be added. It's coming - wherever you live in the world."
"Really, i did not know that ..... ;-)Edited: 5:30 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"We are in hoi an at present . Lot of Japanese and Korean people , everyone is wearing masks . Even locals but many are not ,we’re here for 9 days ,5 left we have felt fine , hoi an is clean in comparison to other parts of Vietnam , plenty of sanitiser in places you go to etc x"

"Wlllem, l think your attempt at humour has been missed. :-(Scott"
"On the Australian forum they have 5-6 pages with only 2 posts about the corona virus, yet Vietnam has reportedly no cases at the moment and Aust has 41 and probably more on the way."
It's coming - wherever you live in the world.========================================I think so too. Its amazing people from some countries are concerned about the virus in Vietnam when their own country is grappling with its own epidemic on a much bigger scale than Vietnam.
"The Government has reopened the schools, and God knows how the Vietnamese take great care of their children !"

"@ross m: Indeed. Several colleagues are panicking about me still going to Vietnam because I'm ""basically guaranteed"" to catch it. My boss is considering having me work from home for 14 days after I return, to which I say ""fine!""Meanwhile, as of this morning, there are more cases recorded in our province than Vietnam had in their entire country. I'm actually starting to worry that my trip will be cancelled because Vietnam won't let Canada in by the time I go. But these same people don't seem concerned about that. I think some people just have it in their heads this is a disease for Asian countries only."
"#17 "" The Government has reopened the schools, and God knows how the Vietnamese take great care of their children ! ""Only high schools have re opened, junior school re open march 8th.https:/…Get your facts straight."
Hi Booked stay in Hoi an 3rd April and debating whether to cancel. Is it worth going or is area in lock down?
"""....or is area in lock down?""Judging by the lack of threads discussing Hoi An's 'lock down', I'd think that it's all business as usual.Albeit significantly quieter.Scott"
Is it worth going or is area in lock down?================================Just what kind of information do you read? In Vietnam they are reporting no new cases for weeks and the ones they had in quarantine have gone home.
"One new case last night, Hanoi I believe travelled from Italy I think..could be wrong,"
"Yes, a Viet who went to visit her sister in England, and then, those 2 idiots went on vacation... in Italy. The case happens to be in the street parallel to mine. Situation under control : the patient in a hospital, all persons on contact with her are tested, all the street buildings have been sanitized, the street is closed to traffic and everything, stores, markets, etc; is closed.Edited: 2:09 am, March 07, 2020 "
Apparently some passengers who travelled on the same flight have continued to Danang and Hoi An.Pictures from today show people emptying the shelves in some of the big grocery stores in Danang. BTW Have seen the same pictures from Germany and other places in Europe. Mass hysteria at its best!
"Correction of my message ! I just made a tour of the whole District of Truc Bach : only the STREET of the same name is closed, NOT the whole District. The street is closed, but all the businesses around have reopened this afternoon, including the local market, not more than 50% of the inhabitants wear a mask, and nobody seems to worry ; I don't !"
"So things are now no longer 'normal', Jack?Who would have thought....Scott"
"Aunt and driver of patient #18 now confirmed as new cases.I thought somebody on here said there was ""No risk"" in Vietnam."
"I was waiting for that stupid comment ! No surprise since you have written on this forum :I see it as my job to annoy people, John, so expect no change. ;-)ScottAs a matter of fact, that's the only thing you are good at !!!!"
"""I was waiting for that stupid comment !""Jack, if anyone knows about stupid comments, it'd be you.That bubble feel like it's shrinking?Scott"
"Yes, we are thinking the same as numbers in the UK are increasing so could be upgraded ta Level 1 country. Vietnam seem to have it all under control."
"ScottBut it's perfectly safe..you know. ..it's only one woman who's been to UK and Italy has flown on an American airline, and walked through God knows how many airports is now in Vietnam under quarantine ,,but it's 100% safe you know .."
"Yep, Annie, it's just woeful.But worse than woeful, it's just plain dangerous. And all because of his agenda.Shameful.ScottEdited: 6:37 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Eh, Scottie Pooh, somebody has written that it is 100% safe here ; how come you do not attack him ?????"
"""...how come you do not attack him ?????""Annie?Think you're losing the plot, Jack....Scott"
"That's not an explanation of your absence of reaction, my dear !!!! Any one ?????"

"""That's not an explanation of your absence of reaction, my dear !!!!""Manat gets it, Jack.Might be time you called it a day.Seems to have passed you by.Scott"
Precisely ManatThe Wikipedia explanation is spot on.
Us too! We are booked to arrive Sunday 5th. So hoping we will still be allowed to fly and to get there. Can you keep in touch so we can discuss? Thank you!
"Olivia EIt really is best if you get your information from the travel advisory of your own country, ..the biggest difficulty is being quarantined in another country or not being allowed back into your own without quarantine,..it's all a huge Unknown."
Yes today there is and like ghost town. Restaurants closing and just very very quiet
"It seems many of the Brits who were on the same flight as COVID-19 case no 17 went afterwards to Hoi An. How is the situation in the city now? Are there restrictions on tourists? Asking because I'm planning to be there next week, and have already been unable to go to Cat Ba."
"First confirmed case who is a foreign tourist in Hoi An yesterday.The local government has sent an advisory notice to all businesses and recommended them to close their businesses until further notice to avoid further spreading of the virus. Seems like many are following the advice, more and more shops, service businesses and restaurants are closed. Some restaurant owners told me that they would like to keep their business open but they follow the governments advice, others are actually more and more afraid to come in contact with foreigners. As somebody mentioned above is Hoi An currently changing from a very pleasant uncrowded place to a ghost town. Nobody knows of course how this is going to develop but there were already last night quite a few tourists walking around An Bang and queuing for an available table at one of the still open restaurants. More restaurant closures are announced for today."
Any updates please?
"We were in the old town last night and day time today. Last night it felt just like going to a holiday resort out of season. People about and shops/ restaurants open but not at all crowded. By 9:00 pm the majority seemed to be heading back to wherever they are staying. Today was quiet ish but did notice a few places closed due to the virus, notices on the doors said reopening 16th March. Spoke to a couple who we have met previously. They’ve been told all their planned excursions are cancelled and half the business in the old town are heeding advice and closing. Reception at hotel have suggested we remain in the hotel resort area and if venturing out, not to go far and to avoid the old town because of the risk of infection too. No idea if the restaurants close by are open and will remain so but I’ll update on here as we do plan on going out for a meal later. In our hotel, there appears to be about 14 people out of a possible 100+ and are closed to new guests unless reservations are long standing ones. All feels a bit surreal especially after the relative bustle of Hanoi."
Heythanks for the info we fly on March 16 to hoi an how is the situation there now?regards
"I arrived with family today and yeah, a lot of nice restaurants and more then 70% of good sites are closed, so you can not feel Hoi An without having nice excursions here. I'm in working in toursim industry and always have the most ""fresh"" information about corona, so for now here are around 38 cases of corona in Hoi An. So be carefully.Hotels affected (cases) with quarantine:Four Season The Nam Hai Hoi An 10-Mar - 24-Mar, Under quarantineBoutique Hoi An Resort 11-Mar - 24-Mar, Under quarantineMoonlight Hotel 08-Mar - 15-Mar, Under quarantineExcursions:Tra Que Village 10-Mar - TBA, Closed as a precautionThanh Ha (pottery) village 10-Mar - TBA, Closed as a precautionCham Island 10-Mar - TBA, Closed as a precautionCarpenter/Pottery Village 10-Mar - TBA, Closed as a precautionCam Thanh Village 10-Mar - TBA, Closed as a precautionMost of tourist sites in Hoi An Ancient town (except Japanese covered bridge)12-Mar - 01-Apr, Closed as a precaution"
"There are a number of people that need to be quarantined/isolated, not 38 actual cases of Covid-19.The patrons at the Moonlight, from a piece of news that I just read, were transfered to a chosen quarantine location in Hue - namely the Sun & Sea Hotel, where local health personnel had set up shop.John"
Not sure about your info Kir t . We did cooking tour yesterday 12th at Tre Que plenty of other tourists around. Also last evening in old town quite but not deserted. This makes your info list look a little different to what we are seeing.
38 appears to be the number of tourists quarantined as they were on the same flights as confirmed cases - a group of 25 Dutch tourists and 13 other European travellers. There are numerous other Vietnamese in isolation or isolated at home. Two confirmed cases in are hospitals nearby and in Hue.Regardsrayza
"Well, there is a huge difference between 38 cases CONFIRMED and 38 being TESTED !!!You want accurate news ? Open the site of the Veit Government newspaper Vietnam Newsvietnamnews.vnEdited: 12:25 am, March 13, 2020 "
So Kir or gtsully can you please advise if we can walk around ancient town? Is it just the old merchants houses closed? Also are many restaurants and cloth shops open?Is central market still operating?Thanks for the info.
"Old Merchant Houses and other paying sites (temples and pagodas) as well as Cham island are closed, but NOT the whole historic center. Some hotels and restaurants closed for lack of clients"
https:/…53461.html
"It is written ""selling visitors tickets"", which are sold to enter into 5 MONUMENTS (Jap Bridge, pagoda, temple, merchant house). The DISTRICT is not closed, as confirmed to me yesterday by a friend who LIVES in Hoi An."
"Correction : the article is not clear at all ; it starts by talking about the tickets, then it says that the whole Historic Center is closed, which is not at all the same. I call my friend and come back here with the latest news.Edited: 1:16 am, March 14, 2020 "
"My friend living in HA just confirmed me that the old CENTER is not closed to tourists. Yesterday evening, French friends of his staying out of the District near An Bong Beach went for diner in the District without any problem. The market is not closed ; so, it is confirmed that, right now, Hoi An Historic center is NOT closed to tourists. He told me also that Danang Cham Museum is closed, but not Marble Mountain."
"I was in the old town about an hour ago. A lot quieter than normal, few restaurants and bars closed but plenty still open.An Hoi was busy with plenty open.Police have asked all bars to close by 10pm as people tend to get closer as the night wears on.Edited: 3:16 am, March 14, 2020 "
"I imagine the My Son temples are closed?I changed hotel yesterday and five places refused me before I found one, with a variety of excuses.Otherwise the town is mostly open for business and there are a lot of tourists. God knows what it must be like normally!Edited: 11:05 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Yesterday we were told to stay in all day do police could come and check us for virus . Apparently they are missing 3 people suspected to have virus . By 5:45 they hadn’t arrived and now they say they aren’t coming !
"Anyone know something about police checkpoints on the way from hoi an to danach? One of our hotel employees is super concerned, she said there are 7 checkpoints along the way and everyone will be stopped and checked for symptoms. Can anyone confirm this?"
"I suppose you mean ""Danang"". I you are healthy, why worry ?"
"Yeah Danang, sorry autocorrect. We don’t have symptoms, everything is fine and we are here in Vietnam since 3 weeks now but the Lady from the Hotel is super scared, since I‘m smoking and have to cough maybe every 30 mins for a half Second (I mean it’s more like clearing my throat than real coughing). She thinks that I will be quarantined immediately when that happens there and then she will get quarantined too and the whole hotel aswell and then she will lose her job and stuff. Don’t know what to think about that, I can understand her panic on the one hand, but on the other I think she might overreact, so don’t know what to do now. We wanted to go to Danang today an buy some masks and stuff in the supermarket and maybe check out the beach, but we are a bit concerned now..."
I went from hoi an to Danang airport yesterday at 5 pm. No check points. But things are changing very quickly from what the world has seen in the last week.
"Up to 13:00 on 17/03/2020, there are 3 cases of infection with Corona virus in Quang Nam (Hoi An).Information to you!"
You should cancel your trip. Sure you can stay here and live (if you get in) but everything is closed.
