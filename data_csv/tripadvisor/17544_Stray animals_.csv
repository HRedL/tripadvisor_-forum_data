Is this a problem in Montego bay? Spoke to a friend whose recently been and he said he didn't see any? Looking to go here next August for our honeymoon! Thanks in advance :)
I don't understand what you are asking. Are you asking if there are stray animals in the country of Jamaica? yes there are just like anywhere else. But nothing to the degree of an epidemic.
I was asking if I would see alot of stray cats and dogs in Montego bay? I've been to Thailand and it was horrendous. Don't want to be spending the whole of my honeymoon crying over horrible sights.
"No disrespect but.....calm down.You are not going to see to see herds of cows, horses, dogs or elephants, rampaging down the streets."
"Depending on where you stay you will see differing levels of stray animals. You will see feral cats, stray dogs, and occasional goat or other ungulate around. But to LadyLulu18's point, no herds. Indeed some resorts maintain and welcome a small number of feral cats as a rodent preventative. But it's not overwhelming...IMO."
"LucyJane,Poverty and strays go hand in hand. There are a lot of strays in Jamaica. When you travel to a developing country like Jamaica, you are sure to see things that might make you want to cry, both human and non-human animal. The problems will, of course, still exist whether or not you are there to witness them on your honeymoon. They will not be front and center of a resort vacation. You sound like a compassionate person. Many who travel to Jamaica are touched by what they see and many of us love it and keep returning over and over. If you choose, you can find ways to give back in relation to issues important to you even on a first trip. Make a donation to Montego Bay Animal Haven, for example. That might help.Wishing you a happy honeymoon.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Is there poverty in Jamaica? Yes, there is. Is the whole country living in poverty surrounded by stray cats and dogs? No, it is are not. Strays go where the food is... you will see them hanging around resorts and restaurants because that’s where well meaning people feed them. Many, if not most, resorts/hotels deal with strays in their ways. If you want to help the strays, don’t feed them. Donate to the local rescues on the island... adopt one or two of the dogs they have... just don’t feed them. If you see them at your resort.. contact a rescue to pick them up. The biggest issue isn’t poverty stricken people owning dogs, it’s people owning dogs who don’t believe in spaying or neutering their animals or containing them. Trust me, my friends and neighbors laugh at how well taken care of my dogs are and can’t believe I allow them in the house... in my bed."
