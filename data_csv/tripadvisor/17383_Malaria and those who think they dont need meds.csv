"Well first off I have been going to punta cana for 10 yrs or so, 4-5 times a year. 2 years ago I purchased a condo. This past dec I went for 2 weeks, when I arrived home I started feeling ill not really sick but headaches and night sweats, I though being 43, that well maybe night sweats are premenopausal, and friends agree'd... About a week later I went to walk in clinic, was diagnosed with bronchitis, after 14 days on biaxin, I went back to clinic with a real sore throat and headaches, sweats and fever.. 104 or so. Dr. advised I had strep throat, 5 days after that with fever on and off everyday, I began shivering and fever was 105, I then went to emergancy room, not even thinking malaria, but the antibiotics were not working. Dr took blood and was gonna do xrays for cyct in throat??? He came back about 1 hour later asking if I had been travelling, that I had tested positive for MALARIA.... Well I will not go back to punta cana without taking antimalaria meds. I have been sick for 2 months, have to go to infectious disease specialist, once a week for blood, Public health is involved and very tired, still have head aches, and still have malaria in my blood which can stay for months. There are 4 types of malaria and this perticular type in punta cana is the worst you can have, however it is not resistant to meds, as it is in africa. So hopefully all will make right decission on taking meds or not... I will for sure. Never thought I would get it. As well as me getting it, my friend from belgium also ownes an apt. there, and she to contracted it at the same time, however she almost died... "
"I certainly wont be going without the medication, not now ive read this, best to be safe than sorry!!! Although everybody seems to have different opinions on this im not taking a chance!!"
"Opinions are great, but if you have ever had malaria, you would know and take the meds.. I felt like I was dieing.. Never want to feel like that ever again. And malaria is rampid in punta cana right now"
"WOW....that's very scarey!!! My husband and I will be heading there in May and he says he doesn't need the meds because he just came back from Kenya and is fine without taking all his meds...I had to call the Dr. to make an appt. to get his meds before traveling since it was short notice, and since he is fine he thinks he doesn't have too....Well I got news for him, he will not be spoiling our very first trip to DR!!. I will be getting him to read your post....Thanks YOU SOOO MUCH FOR POSTING THIS, it sure puts things into perspective!"
"first of all greeneyedbl I am sorry that you took ill...BUT to say that Malaria is RAMPANT in PC is a gross exageration. I also travel frequently to PC..and you are the FIRST to come on here and post that you were afflicted. In fact, No one else comes to my mind. Maybe some of the other regulars can remind me if we have had a case of this ""rampant"" disease?? I am NOT diminishing the fact that you had a horrible time with this disease..but people should talk to their Doc ONLY about this issue. DO NOT take medical advice from a TRAVEL board of unqualified people.I travel as often as you say you do to the DR..mostly Punta Cana..we have a room at a resort but are more often off resort than on..this last time in January we were in Cortecito with friends a couple of times, as well as a day trip out to Boca da Yuma. I was bit like crazy this time, so I would say if it WAS rampant...I would be very sick right now. I wish you the best in your complete recovery..Sorry to jump all over you I just believe that calling it RAMPANT was fear mongering. Let people know the facts..and they can discuss with their Doctor.sorryoff soap box nowLynn"
"Sorry about your illness greeneydbl but I too have to agree and reiterate what Lynn has just said. RAMPANT in PC is a gross exaggeration, there would be at least a few people more with the illness. Also, if anyone becomes unusually ill after returning from any country, don't wait a few weeks before telling your doctor that information.Hope you get better real soon."
I did talk to my dr on this issue and she said meds are not necessary and that the resorts spray. but if anything she would recomend getting hep a and b vacc if we want.
Perhaps it would be a good idea for anyone traveling in the near future to check with the CDC (center for disease control)for updates on any malaria epidemics on the rise.
"Checked and it does NOT say ""malaria is rampant in PC""."

We will be in Punta Cana in 19 days and we are not taking Malaria Med. This will be our 9th trip to DR.Maybe just been lucky I'll take my chances.Sorry this happened to you. 
"I would ask all travellers to speak with local travel specialist doctors. Not just your local doctor... they are generalists and don't have the latest information but can provide the references to travel specialist doctors. These are the people to talk to who are most informed about the issues and risk.I myself wouldn't call malaria rampant in PC, but greeneyedbl still points out other basic facts. Malaria is significant in PC and the strain is the worst. If you read the basic info Health Canada and CDC recommend prophylaxis for travel to the area. I haven't checked on the UK recommendationsIMO, this is basic stuff. I have a lot of access to public health info. The basic recommendations are prophylaxis, that is preventaion, is recommended. The minor side effects of the medication are far better than getting this form of malaria.I have a ton of experience in risk assesement. I find it weird people in general are so willing to forgo antimalarials but they practice other basic risk precautions. For example do you look both ways before you cross the street by your house? Well chances are you'll never get hit on your street but if you look both ways you are practicing some basic precaution. And probably of similar probabilities compared to malaria. The chance of negative outcomes is low, but the outcome is severe. There may be some short-term discomfort from the antimalarial meds, but they are minor and not significant compared to the disease, IMO (and in the literature). The take home is, are you a careful person? Do you look both ways before you cross the street? Do you try not to speak on the cell when driving? Do you not drink and drive? Do you take vaccines to prevent the occurance of disease? Well antimalarials are a basic precaution against serious disease. "
"I am leaving on march 4 again, and will definatly be taking them.. Have a good trip"
greeneyedbl...I have to say I am very surprised by some of the responses to your post. I hope you're feeling better now and thanks for educating those of us who wish to listen to you.
"My DOC strongly recommends the malaria meds if you are going to Punta Cana. Puerto Plata, the meds are not needed. My DOC asked another doctor in her practice who does a lot of travel immunization, and the second doctor is the one who recommended the malaria meds for Punta Cana.I will be leaving in April for 2 weeks in PC with malaria pills in my carry on.J."
"A woman living in Toronto, who had NOT travelled and did not live near an airport, contracted malaria. [information reported in The Ottawa Citizen].Anopheles quadramaculatus mosquito is the newest and most dangerous mosquito to come to NORTH AMERICA. It can carry the protozoan that causes malaria and can spread dengue fever, yellow fever and encephalitis. They have a peculiar habit of doing a handstand as they bite. Scientists suspect this mosquito infected the woman in Toronto, since the normal summer biters do not carry these diseases.Where is OUR government warning tourists coming to North America about this or West Nile Virus... just sayin.We look both ways crossing the street out of habit and having it ingrained since we were little.And yes I AM listening. My Doc does not see the need for the meds. Maybe Docs should be more informed for the money they earn. Why such differing info out there? Again, just sayin. This is a choice to be made between you and your doctor not a forum where you don't even know the person posting....Where do your friends live that also contracted Malaria?Again, I am truly sorry for your illness but again it is NOT a rampant occurrence in the D.R. and would prefer to hear from authorities or have a travel advisory issued."
"Hope you're feeling better. i have been to Punta Cana 5x. Once i took the meds. never got malaria and took the meds. The meds were horrible. I was never sooo sick in my life. never again. I will depend on spraying myself. Might as well stay home??? All over the carib, Malaria, Dengue fever etc. my home town in the summer we have to worry about west nile virus which if contracted would make malaria seem like a little virus cold. Life is a gamble. Eat right, take vitamins and get plenty of exercise to keep your immune system high. Thats all we can hope for. By the way anywhere it is hot warm climate, carib, DR, mexico, louisana, Mississippi, florida. Let's put it this way Mossies and warm weather could be trouble. Hope you are felling better and thanks for the warning. Talk to your Doctor. By the way if it was rappant in Punta Cana the resorts would be empty and would not be there that's why the resorts spray. and my opinion, I do not trust the drug companies, anything to make a buck."
There are travel advisory's for punta cana. I will post it...
"My friends own a condo in my building there as well but also live in belgium, our condo is 2 min walk too the beach, carabella hotel, barcelo hotel, paladium, occidental.. Mosquito's fly faster then I walk. My realestate agent,,who lives in punta cana for 20 yrs now from switzerland as also informed me that there is a ton of malaria there right now, she was not surprise I had contracted it. "
"Also check the CDC website for the US. Lots of info on there concerning malaria. Yes, we all take chances in life, and I'm not even sure yet if I will take the anti-malaria meds, but it definitely gives me pause when I read what's out there and read greeneyedbl's posts. "
"The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends malaria prophylaxis (medication) and the use of personal protective measures (e.g., repellants) against mosquito bites for all rural areas of the Dominican Republic and all areas in the province of La Altagracia, including tourist resorts (the tourist resort destinations of Punta Cana and Bavaro are located in the province of La Altagracia)."
this is the linkphac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/…mal_dr070524-eng.php
"Here is another...After receiving reports of malaria in two U.S. travellers to the Dominican Republic, CDC contacted the Pan American Health Organization, World Health Organization, and Ministry of Health (MoH) in the Dominican Republic, which initiated investigations. Seventeen patients (i.e., three from the United States, six from Canada, and eight from European countries) were identified*. P. falciparum malaria was confirmed in all of them. Sixteen of the patients had travelled to Punta Cana resorts in La Altagracia Province and one to San Francisco de Macorís in Duarte Province. Sixteen returned home during 3 to 16 November and one returned 20 December; all were admitted to hospitals, and six required treatment in ICUs. As of 30 December, no deaths had been reported; three patients remained hospitalized. Seven of the patients confirmed that they had not travelled to any other malarious areas nor received any blood transfusions during the preceding year.linkphac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/…dr3109b-eng.php"
"C'mon, do not compare WNV to malaria in PC. This reeks of ingorance. 99% of WNV infections show no morbidity let alone mortality. Don't dilute the debate with non-relevant info that the common people cannot discriminate from. You are doing everyone a disservice that way.BTW debinatore there are a ton of WNV warnings out here. It has been done huge time. Intersting post on the the species of mosquito and the single malaria occurance. That species has been trapped here in ON but I can't find any info on your post of a malaria case. Please provide the link so I can follow up. At this time the point is there is risk of malaria. It certainly isn't evident in the US and Canada from case follow-ups. However it is endemic in some regions. This at this time include PC. "
"Again, not discounting what you are saying but that report is 2 years old.IF we are here to educate it should be pointed out there this drug inteferes with a lot of prescribed and over the counter drugs.Also, often overlooked is that with the anti-malarial medication is the recommendation to stay OUT of the SUN and avoid alcohol. How many people know or knew that BEFORE taking the drug. Also, the side effects of this drug can be severe in children.Please do not take advice from anyone on a forum, only you and your doctor knows what's best for YOU.fairview.org/healthlibrary/content/ma_chloro…"
"Yes this ""debate"" is getting very diluted with links that are over 5 years old.I'm done."
"I saw a dump truck full of malaria just the other day...well over a ton...the tires were almost flat!Sorry....just had to throw a little humour into some of your attention grabbing claims of rampant and tons of malaria.As a public service I thought I would list my most notible risks to visitors to the area.1. Skin Cancer2. Over Eating and Obeasity3. Vehicle Accidents (tourist related)4. Alcohol Poisoning and Liver Damage5. Drownings6. Slips and falls resulting in serious head injury7. Dengue Fever8. Salmonella9. MalariaNumbers 1 through 6 are common results of poor judgement and are the most prevalent ( \although as a percentage of the nearly 4 million guests a year...a low risk just the same.Numbers 7 through 9 are far less likely than any that preceed them, although reported cases of each can be found if you look hard enough....but again....in numbers so small that they do not really register.There are risks everywhere we go. Your personal experience is an miniscual representation of the area as a whole. Just the same, I understand your concerns and your good intentions. By using words such as ""rampant"" and ""tons of""....you loose a bit of credability due to the exageration of the issue at hand.I live within a 1/4 mile of your place down here. I am very familiar with the area. I know that the resorts surrounding your area fog for mosquitoes nightly, as I have to drive through the fog on numerous occasions as it drifts westward on the breeze, effectively covering the residential areas as well.I hope all is well with your return visit to the area!CheersPCMike"
"That is good as you are not educated on the subject, I am talking first hand, I never once told anyone to take the meds, but be informed, get the right information from travel dr.s not general practice as they are not up to date. The CDC and other agency's web sites are not fully up to date, call them to be sure just know the pro's and con's. I learned that first hand, not 2 not 5 yrs ago but have been going through this for 2 months, versus the pills 4 weeks? I just posted this to try to help people make an informed decission, having heard it first hand.cheers allMichelle"
You mentioned that your friends also contracted the virus. How about your husband? Any problems there?Cheers PCMike
"Sounds fine but I'm not done. In over 5 years one person in the GTA may have gotten malaria from what experts would consider a very rare vector transmisson. These extrapolate, 1 in about 9 million people over over the last five years of exposure, maybe....Meanwhile PC is a known outbreak of P falciparum malaria. I have access info in a major health unit here in ontario (which is avaiable to anyone who wants the info) that the malaria cases in 07 were around 45+ alone. In Ontario I'd guess it is 2X+ I'm not subscribing this to PC but malaria cases associated to travel in Ontario is significant. So you have a 1 in 45 million chance of malaria in Ontario over the last 5 years (not much info here, but I'm going on what was given). The chance in DR is probably 1000 X or more higher based on case results. Considering P. Falciparum results in a hospital stay at least, and has significant mortality... why not take basic precautions.I agree, speak to your doctor, and ask for a reference to a medical specialist.... They are the most informed.vienemo,.... if you can take a pill to remove 95% of most of the above risks, then why not? Especially when Falciparum malaria is so serious? Seems easy to me. I use sunscreen to avoid skin cancer, I moderate my eating, I minimize my vehicle use and wear a seatbelt, I'm not an alcoholic, I don't swim beyond my ability, I cook my food thoroughly, etc, etc. The medication for malaria is just another chain in the link."
PS...since you will be in the neighbourhood this week...feel free to give me a call and we can meet! I like to meet the community from back home! You can send me a PMCheersPCMike

"MIKE , do you know cocomar, in corticeto? behind sunbeach plaza, beside santa maria del mar? That is were we will be..lol lounging or at el pulpo cojo... or jellyfish...Cant wait."
"The Blood Bank of Delmarva (DE) considers the ""risk"" of contracting Malaria in Punta Cana dangerous enough to have removed me from the Donor List for a full year !! I think that is pretty significant in establishing the possibility of contracting Malaria while vacationing in Punta Cana. That said, we did not let fear prevent us from going and having a wonderful time there. While there, my husband and I tried to be careful and use our insect spray. We felt that the mosquitoes were worse when we visited in October than in July. I think we would consider anti Malaria drugs for our next trip there. Some people get bit more than others - we would sit with a party of six others in the evenings, and in spite of being heavily sprayed with repellent, I would get bitten when no one else seemed to ! I think the risk certainly increases with more time spent there, but it only takes one bite from one infected insect to become ill. I hope you are feeling better and have a speedy recovery, Greeneydbl."
"Well here in canada, after having malaria, I can no longer donate blood for 3 YEARS...For 3 years will be on a list at cdc, and public health units in canada."

"Well considering I have been on the medication for last 1 month everyday, and double the dose, I have recieved all the medical information side effect and such. No where in any information does it say anything about not drinking. It does state aoid prolonged exposure to sun or sunlamps. The dr.'s never even said not to drink.If you dont take medication before you go as I did, I did not think risk was high either. If you contract malaria, A) you could die, or B) you will have to take meds, and for a longer period as well as doubling the dose."

"I agree with you on dr's advise, but needs to be the right dr's. GP's are not educated on this subject as I learned, after contacting malaria. My own personal gp new nothing on malaria, but she takes the antimalaria when she travels. she did advise me of that, so does my specialist whom is treating my malaria, he also told me he has seen to many deaths from malaria, that can be prevented."
what about puerto plata???
"Greeny...I certainly know where you are talking of. You pick the time!Now...something you have said concerns me greatly. You mentioned ""doubling your dosage"". Literally all documents clearly state DO NOT double dose unless clearly advised by your doctor. This information could be a disservice and perhaps a greater risk to those who take that advise.Please...if your doctor advised you to do so...that is based on your individual case....not a standard practice.CheersPCMike"
"Again, not disputing anything you are TOLD or NOT TOLD. BUT.... if you're going to educate yourself with the intention of educating others then you should research a little more. There are NUMEROUS websites from health authories and the manufactures of anti-malarial medication that DO warn of the interactions on ALCOHOL.From the link I provided earlier....""Do not drink alcohol while you are taking this medicine because it may increase the risk of liver damage.""As you said some doctors are not up to date with information so I ask YOU to research the side effects and DON'T take the advice of just ONE doctor that professes to know all.Cheers,Debbie "
"MS. Green, you said ""he also told me he has seen to many deaths from malaria"".I hope you or he was exaggerating. ""If"" he has SEEN many deaths, how many did he ""see"" and would he be willing to be proactive and alert the proper authorities so as to educate the traveler?"
"debinatore, you do realize you reference only one medication... There are others that don't have such significant alcohol contraindications. And they are very commonly used."

my question is this. I only live a very short distance from the OP. If a doctor has had many malaria deaths...WHY have I not heard of it. A Channel news..Citytv News..NADA.I am going to spend a little time on Monday while at the office making calls to Kitchener and the powers that be. I would like to know the truthsigning off...bye deb..bye big bro I will call you tomorrow..Lynn
"mike, I was on 500 mg of chloriquine to get rid of malaria, the dosage was based on levels in blood, this was done by the dr. he is a specialist in infectious disease's. I will provide name for all who would like to talk to him...Dr. SteingartKitchener, Ont.Canada.Deb, as for this dr. seeing deaths from malaria, he is not a regular dr. he specializes in all infectious disease. This type of malaria, can manafest in the brain causing coma and death in 36 to 48 hours.. "
"KW, I'm only referring the medication that Michelle is talking about.As for information and education,there is lots out there, both for and against and should only be decided by you and your doctor who should be based on your medical history.What I can't seem to get through to someone is that I agree it's best to be proactive and I'm still waiting for answers on some of my questions. I don't think she's willing to actually read them though. I especially would like to know how many deaths her doctor has ""seen"", her words, not mine. Exagerations and untruths such as RAMPANT and TONS do no one any good.A debate is fine if you can keep it civil.Cheers,Debbie"
"thanks for providing that info. I would really like to educate myself a bit more on the subject..as I still tend to believe that this is a push from drug companies to get docs to prescribe. I know for a fact that they do offer deals to docs for how much they subscribe of certain meds,Like I said I do not doubt your experience, I just find it far from typical. I have family who lives there year round...as well as canadian friends who also live year round. never an issue. well now I am really gone for the nightCheersLynn"
"As he told me, he has seen many deaths from malaria, not sure if he was oversea's, hear or wear, but he is a specialist not just some quack on the corner... Call the kitchener waterloo Public Health, call the dr. he will advise you and then you can come confirm, that i'm not a quack, but actually am just telling my story. I am not hear to advise anyone, or teach anyone. Again I say, I to chose not to take them in the past, but learned my lesson in a big way. There was more bad in not taking them and getting seriously ill, its not a flu, or cold. Do some research on the net on this type of malaria. CDC STATS...approx 3 millon people a year are affected by malaria, and 1 million approx. die each yr for same..."
"With doing research after getting this, I wondered about local people as well, and have come to learn that many come to be immune to the parasite over the years. I have become friends with alot of people in p//c and alot of them as well have had malaria, and have been hospitalized as well. "
" *yawn*  Wasen't there an identical thread this time last year? or was that just last month?  It all comes down to the individual and their thoughts on the matter. As has been stated many, many times on TA, consult YOUR doctor only. If they feel it necessary, fine.   But just to add, my doctor has told me there are worse things than malaria to worry about in the carribean."
"Not sure why people are saying that Im telling you to take meds, as im not nor have anywhere in this thread, I am saying that I learned my lesson. Just inform yourself of the facts and go to RIGHT DR.S THAT KNOW ABOUT TRAVEL NOT A LOCAL GENERAL PRACTICE. After finding out I had malaria, went to my gp, was asking a bunch of questions and she could not answer any of them, she had to call the local public health to find out. ''AS for worse things, ya like cancer maybe... its no joke the dr. in p/c told my girlfriend who got malaria same time as I did, told her if she had waited one more day, she would not have made it. As well I cannot give blood for 3 years from when im negative, which could be months although, my blood levels were 5% at first, have now gone to less then .1 percent, could stay there for months... "
"Nobody can give blood for while after being in the carribean. Not saying you are telling people to take meds.  We value your experience in the DR. (sorry)People just get tired of the exageration etc. He said/she said. My friends, cousins, uncle's dad told us this."
"BINGO, and don't forget RAMPANT and TONS.I think this whole thread should be deleted due to the exagerations. Cheers,Debbie"
"You can give blood after coming from the carribean, not sure where you got your info... And I never said he/said she said, I was telling you what the SPECIALIST...DR. ADVISED....If you yawning and not wanting to read the thread why join it. I was telling my story to people that want to know, and there is alot of people that want information so they can make the right decissions...That is what this forum is for.. "
"Regarding blood donations after a Caribbean visit... available via the Red Cross.Education is a great thing.Cheers,Debbie"
"deb, I think you need to educate on current issues in p/c. Call the provided dr.s and public health in kitchener waterloo, and see for yourself.. Not sure when you became an expert, but your miss informed. Call the CDC. find out for yourself. "
Thanks Debbie!!25 days till Steve's!!!!
"ok..since i cannot get to sleep lolNO one can donate blood after being in the dominican Republic. Thats ok..they wouldn't take mine either...as I am a born and raised northern ireland lass..who has spent too much time on a dairy farm. No I never got mad cow disease although my husband and family may disagree (shhhuuudddupp Mike lol)but it is a risk that the canadian blood banks will not take..just like the ban on donations from those of us who travel to the DR and other spots in the Carribean.Life is full of risks I agree..BUT it is up to us to use our brains and decide which risks are worth ""taking a cure that can be worse than the disease"" forThis is a personal decision and should be made by you and your trusted doctor. I would maybe suggest if you are worried to follow it up at a travel clinic.Either that or we could all live in little bubbles lolOK. TIREDbye"
"Here we go again with the personal attacks, where did I say that I was an expert. All I've been trying to do is educate and BE educated. How about you.Have you finally read all the literature about interactions with the SUN and ALCOHOL?"
Different doctors in diffrent provinces. Debbie is not Doctor but has a wealth of info and trips in her credits.
"You're welcome Mohitoboy, have a Presidente on me, I'll pay the tab when I get there, oh, and get one for the Mike's too.Cheers,Debbie xx"
"let me rephrase that. You cannot donate blood for twelve months after returning from Punta Cana and the area around the border of Haiti,,I believe you still can if you were in the other areas"
"lol, done!-mohito"

"Hah, look back one previous post, you missed it."
"deb, i'm not slamming you, I agree with you about dr.s advise... but the right dr. some are unaware of these issues. Had I not gotten malaria, I propable would not take it this time, but since I go every 2 months or so, I am at higher risk of contracting it, and believe me I would not wish that on anyone it was horrible felt like I was dying, and none of the dr.s I saw new what was wrong with me first bronchitis, then strep, finally they found it. But I posted so people are aware it is there, and right now for some reason, not sure why but there is more then normal, I mean come on 3 of my friends and myself got it all in same month? That is very rare. I have been on a high dose for a little over a month now, and have had no side effects and have also been tanning. I am aware some people dont like taking meds, but its something to think about that is all sorry if I sounded as if I were attacking I was not, just stating facts, on my case and my case only. Check with the dr. office I supplied, as well as kitchener public health office. "
"greeneyedbl:Thank you very very much for your post of today! It should give everybody pause for thought. I for one feel that you have given everyone that is concerned about this issue, a very insightful warning about a number of peripheral issues to consider-notably the potential for the undereporting of occurance!"
"Wow. I am sorry to hear about your illness and wish you a speedy recovery. Now I do also agree that everyone should discuss this with their family physician. You can take antimalarial drugs, they don't always work and there are a slew of other diseases as well, do you take anything for those? i won't bother listing all the diseases, way too many to count.Rampant, i think not. The advisory wouldn't be low if that's the case.Make you own personal choice!"
"I live in Kitchener and not once have I heard or read anything regarding malaria and PC. My own dr told me no to the meds.As for other risks, yes there are risks in life, I know first hand. I am the very rare case of a young, healthy woman who got a blood clot in the lung. Could I prevent this, nope, am I lucky to be alive, very much so, can I prevent another one in future, very minimally.The point to all of this, get advice from you OWN Doctor and do your OWN research. None of us know eachother on a personal basis therefore why would you suddenly start taking advice from a stranger? You have to be cautious in trusting those you know, why would i start trusting a someone I don't?"
"That is what we are sayin BUT ASK A DR. WHO KNOWS..NOT A GP... Read the previous messages before putting in your 2 cents. I did contract malaria, when I returned jan 7/09. Call and check with kitchener waterloo public health. I was sharing my story not telling people what to do. There are many people that want to know, for those of you that dont, dont read the thread.cheersmichelle"
"Good morning again....sun is out....as usual....beautiuful start to the day.As I see this conversation continue, it appears that their are 2 sides of the fence....those how feel the risk is great enough to medicate yourself and those who figure the risk is miniscual enough not to concern them.Both are valid points...one based on a personal experience and others based on the reality that the risk is low, although a chance.I for one, having been a 365 day a year resident of the area for the past 4+ years have yet to know of a friend, aquantence, guest or local news report of anyone contracting malaria. In a given week I am exposed to 1000's of people in the area. I am also in contact by internet with 1000's of future and past guests to the area. Not one....not even suspected case of malaria.Yet you have stated that 4 of your friends contracted the virus, that your doctor knows of many cases personally and the latest claim...I have become friends with alot of people in p//c and alot of them as well have had malaria, and have been hospitalized as well. I do not know the circle of friends you keep, but it sounds like an unlucky lot, if in fact ""alot of them have had malaria, and have been hospitalized as well"".Not doubting your claim, but just amazed that given my residency here and my exposure to guests and locals of all shapes and sizes....of all ages and cultures....of all levels of personal health....I have yet to hear of a single case.I am just trying to put this into perspective. Your time here in a given year amounts to perhaps a month or so of total time, yet your claims of rampant maleria are well above what any health department would consider normal.Cheers from 24cPCMike"
i am also very sorry to her how sick you became it must have been terrible. Is there a time of yr that malaria is more a risk than other months? my dr says meds arent necessary What are the side affects that make drs not want to prescribe them if they can prevent such an awful illness? this is my 1st time to punta cana and im really wondering if we made a bad choice to go there?
"WOW,I see some of you have been very busy since I checked TA yesterday morning, lol.I got bored after the first two pages and went right to page 9.This debate will go on year after year.dog"
"Actually, this past yr. have spent a total of 3 months, same as last yr. and like you I also have residancy in d.r. as well as own property and the ""Friends I keep"" come on mosquitos bite all... they are not picky blood is blood... malaria is in punta cana, it is documented and it is on the rise, I choose to take the meds, unless you have had malaria I think you dont know what your talking about. If you had unprotect sex, would you use a condom, not always 100%, not always safe, but you would use it, chloroquine no different, again I'm not telling people to take it but telling a different side to the story. Malaria is there and on the rise. People should know both sides of the story. You are lucky I guess not getting it so was I for 9 yrs, but it only took one time, and I got very ill...End of Story"
Do most people think that Doctors will err on the side of safety to protect themselves or offer their true opinion?Never give up the thrill of living for the safety of existence.
"www.malariafacts.ca View A Map of Risk Areas Plus Ways To Help Protect Yourself. Act Now!   Malaria Risk Malaria risk—exclusively due to P. falciparum— exists throughout the year, especially in the western provinces of Azua, Bahoruco and Dajabón and in La Altagracia province. Risk in other areas is low to negligible. There is no evidence of P. falciparum resistance to any antimalarial drug.  Prevention Recommended prevention in risk areas: II  Related links - Infectious diseases of potential risk for travellers [pdf 1.97Mb]  - Vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccines [pdf 203kb]  - Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations; and malaria situation  "
GreeneyedblI wish you well in your recovery.I don't believe you could call malaria rampant in the DR. Of the studies done the DR and Haiti an its neighbors account for 6% of the malaria disease's reported and the leader of the pack will be Africa and the Sudan area with over 90% of the cases. Granted sometimes these studies might not be accurate but they are very close. The chances of a person contacting malaria in the DR are very slim chance versus other parts of the world 
"THat is the same map that has been posted forever. Even the ""warnings"" on Bonvoyage.ca (some sort of Gov't site) ahve not changed since before I booked my first trip to the DR.Do they (someone) look after fogging around your condo? As you may get less protection if they do not. I know there was a fogging team at DREAMS PC last year, and we saw NO mosquitter's at all.Hate to keep this thread going but. As for you asking where I got my info about giving blood after you return...MY doctor told me (who also tavels a fair amount to sunshine destinations)Not that I give blood, but that's my decision. "
"These posting on government sites are there for a reason.. fogging is done, however not as much as on resorts, having said that I can walk to 10 resorts within 10 mins, 5 of which are within a 2 min walk, and again mosquitos fly. Not sure why people are resisting what I am saying, I IN NO WAY AM TELLING ANYONE WHAT TO DO OR NOT DO... I simply am informing people about my experience... Again I go often and will protect myself what you do is your choice. There are many threads here and some I choose to read and some I dont. The resort reviews, again are in the eyes of the beholder, I would not stay away from a resort because of someone's say so... I would experience for myself, but I would take it into consideration... Just as we do when we are children, we get vaccined for all kinds of illness, one being menangitiis, I know no one who has had that however we all get the shot for protection... And many others.. Food For Thought... cheers"
"Wow my head is spinning after reading all of this. I just wanted to point out one thing here. Greeneyedbl, maybe I misunderstood, but did you not say you will be able to donate blood in three years? According to the ""Canadian Blood Services"" website::Malaria policy criteriaOur malaria policy changes April 2, 2007Our malaria policy impacts people who spend time in malaria-risk zones and people who have had malaria. The table below outlines the policy, which took effect on April 2, 2007.Duration in risk zone Policy (effective April 2, 2007)Less than 6 consecutive months Eligible to donate blood one year after departure date from malaria-risk zone:All components of your donation (red cells, platelets and plasma) can be used for transfusion.6 or more consecutive months Eligible to donate blood three years after departure date from malaria-risk zone:All components of your donation (red cells, platelets and plasma) can be used for transfusion.“I have had malaria” Not eligible to donate blood.NOTE VERY LAST LINE!!!Also I have been a regular blood donor for years. Since I started travelling to Punta Cana, I have been told by CBS, that I cannot donate blood for one year after returning. Travelling to other parts of the D.R., Cuba and Mexico, I have been allowed to donate with no time restrictions after returning.Lynn I would be so grateful to know what you find out tomorrow. We're going to Punta Cana in April.We did start the antimalaria meds the first time we went to Punta Cana but stopped while there because of the side effects.I will also say (maybe we're just lucky) but in 3 visits to P.C.,never yet got a mosquito bite. Here in PEI, we can't even sit outside in the evening, the mosquitos are so bad!!"
"summer, actually the health professionals advised me of the 3 yr. no donation issue, I read that same article last night, and it states that if you have had malaria, you can never give blood... "
"K thanks, that would make more sense, that you would never be allowed to donate again, same as people who have had Hepatitis. "
"Greeneyedbl,Good Morning !~~Thank you for sharing your experience with us~~. I too wish you a speedy recovery. It’s unfortunate that people can’t come on the forum to provide information without being attacked. But, so sadly, that is the way it is. Forums were created to put OUR experiences up for viewing. The mission to these services provided by TA was clear. Help other travelers with their upcoming trips with OUR advice on what WE experienced. You’ve done that and have been “challenge“, “questioned” and “corrected”. I’m sorry for that. It’s quite disheartening. Stay strong, keep posting and stand by your experience. Don’t let the negative bring you down. It's RAMPANT here. I’ll preface that, like you, we have had over ten trips to the area, two to other parts of DR and to many to mention “outings” off resort and my family of four have chosen NOT to take malaria drugs…While it’s true that we’ve not been affected nor have any of the people we know, and they know and they know, that does NOT negate what you have come aboard to share. And it does NOT discount the severity of Malaria. The FACTS are YOU got it. Those are the facts. Nothing anyone tries to post will change that and everything that is, is counterproductive to good will and what you have experience. For those coming aboard with interest or seeking advice on the topic, I would strongly recommend you speak thoroughly with your MD or clinic. Posts like this are valuable and pertinent and many times put “the thought” in a travelers head that they weren’t otherwise aware of. I believe that was the original posters objective. ~ At times, there are doctors that are not necessarily “updated” on traveling precautions. I’ve read with interest how some doctors don’t even have the knowledge about this subject and therefore can’t help their patients. I suggest if you are not feeling completely informed by those that care for you, seek alternative help. Infectious Disease Specialists are whom have the best advice for traveling precautions. Each of us are unique and have our own personal history that needs to be considered by those advising us. The people on this board do not.Again, thank you Greeneyedbl for sharing your experience with us. Good Luck to you..PeaceLea"
"I am very sorry to hear of greeneyedbl's experience. I wish you a speedy recovery.Thank you for sharing your experience with us, but unfortunately only people who frequent this forum will know. Why hasn't this specialist that has treated you informed the media so that all Canadians or those travelling to PC are advised? Four people in your group have been affected, is this not worthy of informing the public at large?I am certain that the media would respect the privacy of these individuals, I am just amazed that with the ongoing ad campaign for malaria meds (here in Ontario anyway) why the media wouldn't jump on this very serious case and expose it to those deciding on whether or not to take the medication.I regret booking this trip to PC for March Break."
"I asked earlier if this doctor is willing to be ""proactive"" and alert the proper authorities so as to advise the travellers through proper channels.I too would like to know the truth as to whether or not these are isolated incidents or is it ""rampant"" or there are ""tons"" of Malaria cases like the OP is claiming. It's one thing to talk of your own experience but not when the claims can't be backed up or confirmed here or there. Not saying it's not true, we all should welcome the education on this subject.I was going to send this link to the proper authorities and see if they would investigate and see why there hasn't been an advisory issued or why any North American news outlets haven't picked up on the story, but what's the point if people are getting posts deleted?Cheers and be wellDebbie"
"My only concern is the unsupported claims made...now the latest being that ""malaria is on the increase in Punta Cana"". Is this based on a particular time period? A year....10 years....100 years? On what level do you support the claim and where is the evidence to back it up?As I said earlier in support of your coming forward to inform us of your personal experience...using phrases such as you continue to do, only lead to what amounts to scare mongering.Please think about what you type. If you sensatioanilize a situation...good or bad...you are responsible to back it up with hardcore fact....not speculation.Cheers and look forward to meeting you next week!PCMike "
"A few pages back, hopeToronto wrote ""what about puerto plata???"" Basically, the north coast, Puerto Plata, Playa Dorada, Sosua & Cabarete are NOT affected by malaria. The key piece of advice that is missing in this thread, whether you choose to take or not take anti-malarial medication is this...***If you develop 'flu like symptoms' within twelve months of returning from an area where malaria is known to exist, TELL THE DOCTOR*** This is still true EVEN IF YOU TOOK THE MEDS."
"Wow, what a thread. First and foremost good luck with your recovery greeneyedbl! I can't imagine what you must be going through.That said, what I'd like to know is am I more at risk today than my first visit to Punta Cana in 2000 or even my last visit in 2007? If so can someone provide me with a link supporting that? I've searched and can't find anything more recent than March 2008.Thanks!-Brugal"
"Well, where I am from, we have a Nurse who is a Travel Specialist with our local R.H.A. I too, went on the Canadian Health Web sites, and did't find anything about Malaria in Punta Cana. What I did find was dengay (sp?) fever appearing all over the place. So, I called the Travel Nurse, and said just that. She advised that Malaria is a serious issue now in Punta Cana, and strongly recommends that I get the Malaria Pills. There is a lag time from the time Malaria gets reported locally to when the Cdn Health Sites get a hold of it. So, that may be why we can't find information about it on those sites. The meds aren't that expensive, but you do have to start taking them a week before your trip. F.Y.I. I have a son who's gone to Sosua Summers of 2007 and 2008 volunteering with Hero Holiday, and Malaria was not an issue at that time, where her was. Now it is in Punta Cana, so the decision is yours. Frankly, I'll take the meds, it's hard enough to get into a Doctor when something isn't serious, I can't imagine the crap I would have to go through to get properly diagnosed in my small rural town.Moira "
"Please substantiate....""serious issue now"".If in fact it was any more an issue now than it was last year or the many years before, we would have been notified here at the resorts, not only through government channels, but also by the various tour companies that send guests to the area. They would also do audits on irradication techniques ( ie...removal of standing water...etc) as well as spraying schedules and the likes.....none of which has become apparent to me.if someone...there has to be someone out there....who can give me and the rest of the readers...HARD FACTS....to back up the claims of increased incidence in this country.....the board is yours. Please back up your claim. Otherwise, your words are of little service to anyone.CheersPCMike"
"Here is the proactive step I have taken...I have provided CBC with the information on this thread.I am hoping that ""if"" Dr. Chris Steingart has ""seen"" so many malaria deaths and has recently diagonsed more cases and ""if"" he has reported his findings to the proper authorities then WHY has the public not been informed. I am hoping that someone with ""absolute"" knowledge can and will relay to the public whether or not ""tons"" of people in PC have malaria and whether or not it is as ""rampant"" as claimed here.Deb"
"You said it Mike and Deb.  Presidente's on me!!As was said, it is no diffrernt this year from last.Warnings this year are the same as last, and before that. There is always ""the chance"" but you could contract Malaria, but the ""risk"" is also in Canada if the right (wrong) mosquito finds its way!"
"Get over the 2 words used, malaria is an issue in punta cana, do what you want. But call the agency's that are up on current issues, not a general practice dr. who has no info. Here are 2 agencys to call, Kitchener waterloo public health and The CDC. Then come back and tell us wht they say, I know because I have already called...."
"Oh and it kills me that people sit on this site, read everyones threads and all of a sudden is the expert on the matter... Get a Life ... A forum is meant to people to share their experience and maybe learn something."
"If you listen to radio stations all over canada, it does advise punta cana travellers to take meds for malaria"
"First the ""CDC"" site takes you to US run site, not CANADIAN. Secondly, I feel the doctors in other parts of Canada (the world does not revolve around Onterrible) are just as knowledgable. ""Oh and it kills me that people sit on this site, read everyones threads and all of a sudden is the expert on the matter... Get a Life ... A forum is meant to people to share their experience and maybe learn something.""...Yes I do it but so do YOU and many others.We are NOT nor have EVER claimed to be experts.""If you listen to radio stations all over canada, it does advise punta cana travellers to take meds for malaria""Not here in the east. And who do you really think pays for the commercials?? Some are definitly paid for by the drug companies."
"Sorry to hear about your Illness, but you really got me started getting worried here... we've just been to PC, back a week, our GP just recommended Typhoid and Hep A vaccination, which all of us (7 including a Baby ) got, now, he never mentioned Malaria, and given that we, despite Anti-Moskito Creams and Lotions, all got bitten several times, unfortunately even the baby! poor mite, I'm actually quite worried now. We've not been 100% since coming back, mainly still diarrhia and getting sick, so I'd say that's just a stomach thing. My GP said that's quite common, so unless the symptoms worsen, nothing we can do.We've been in PC now in February (2009), in Majestic Colonial, so, would be nice to hear about other Travellers, if somebody else got sick or not...For all of us I hope we'll be fine. The holidays were great, and we really enjoyed our stay. This worries spoils it a bit now... :-("
"greeneyedbl, You wrote ....~~Oh and it kills me that people sit on this site, read everyones threads and all of a sudden is the expert on the matter... Get a Life ... A forum is meant to people to share their experience and maybe learn something. ~~I say...LOL ! BRAVO !!!!!!~ I applaud your diligence, knowledge and accurate assessment of the underlining problems on this board.. The only FACT I needed to read was that YOU GOT IT !!.. There is nothing more powerful than THAT fact. !!! How dare ANYONE try and minimized that…Be well !I’m outta here …PeaceLea"
"I am not heartless, I am sorry for your experience, but as soon as there is a small amount of truth-stretching...it's like adding fuel to the fire. It happens every time on the board."
"I have NOT tried to minimize the claims. Only trying to get facts so that we can ALL learn. This has made me research the subject further and still don't know what ""my"" conclusion is.I would like ""my"" questions answered also... ""I"" feel that ""I"" have taken a proactive step.

Your hostility isn't helping matters. If I do get answers you can bet that I will post them here and with no exagerations either. TA's motto is after all, ""Get the truth, then go""Cheers,Debbie"
"greeneyedblQuestion.....you stated `and still have malaria in my blood which can stay for months.` Does this mean that if you return to Punta Cana and are bitten by a mosquito, that mosquito can pass it on to someone else, or is it in fact dormant."
"I am so sorry to learn of your illness and the toll it has taken on your immune system. We are considering a trip to Punta Cana staying at Tortuga Bay Villas - I have increased concerns reading about your situation as I have a weakened immune system. I am on doxycyline (antibiotic). Do you think it is 'safe"" if you spray oneself with mosquito repellants or should we seriously reconsider this trip and book elsewhere? Thank you for your opinion. "
"Jumper, that's a good question, found this on:www.hmc.psu.edu/healthinfo/m/malaria.htm""Malaria is spread in three ways. The most common is by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. However, malaria can also be spread through a transfusion of infected blood or by sharing a needle with an infected person. There are four different species of parasites that cause malaria. They are the Plasmodium falciparum (which is the most fatal), P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. When an infected mosquito bites a person, the parasites enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver. They multiply in the liver, then travel back into the blood, where they continue to grow and multiply so quickly that they clog blood vessels and rupture blood cells. When the red blood cells burst, the parasites are released and then attack other red blood cells. Malaria is not contagious, which means one person cannot pass it directly to another. HOWEVER, IF A MOSQUITO THT IS NOT INFECTED BITES AN INFECTED PERSON, IT PICKS UP THE MALARIA PARASITE. Animals can also get malaria, but animal malaria cannot spread to humans, and human malaria cannot spread to animals."""
"Thank Lea, its very fustrating that you come and tell something, that actually happened 2 months ago, and you flack for it. I'm sure thier are some that want to know, and take precautions. I have used this site many times, but not eveyday or even every month. I most certainly don't sit and read and pretend to be a punta cana expert. I do know that I contracted malaria while in punta cana in jan/ 09 this yr. and 3 others in my building contracted it as well the same time period... What are the chances.I have also provided Dr's and Health units whom have been involved, to verify what some think, im a drug company trying to push drugs?? LOL As well commenting on dr. steingart, he is and infectious disease specialist, i'm sure he has seen deaths due to malaria, wether here or overseas. People who argue and put in 2 cents they know nothing about??? Well again thanks its nice to have someone understand why i posted. I love p/c and will not stop going, but will be taking meds along for the ride... "
"Here is a thread issued Feb 19-09, that will either solve or fuel this debate:www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/305012"
"GREEN, in short, will you be cured? Or will you always have this in your blood?Deb"
"I am always saddened to hear that someone left for a holiday and something rotten happened to them - like that poor woman who stepped on a caterpillar - somewhere in SA, I think - came home to Alberta and died shortly afterward because the caterpillar was toxic. From what I have heard of malaria, the disease is not a pleasant thing to endure. However there has been nothing out here on the west coast of Canada regarding news reports, travel advisories etc regarding ""rampant malaria in Punta Cana"" or ""malaria being on the rise in Punta Cana"".Saw the doctor last summer when I booked our trip, was advised (due to a serious outbreak of local hep A - my hubby caught it)to get my Twinrix and ensure my tetanus was up to date. Given that we are not travelling to Punta Cana, but elsewhere in the DR, we were advised that we do not require malaria meds or any further preventative shots or meds. Checked with the travel clinic docs (who are supposed to be ""experts"" in this area) and was told the same thing.Never have I heard a whisper out here about ""rampant"" malaria in Punta Cana.Will be interesting to see how/what the CBC does with their investigation of the subject...Storm"
"Here are the facts... went to punta cana dec 26 arriving home on jan 7 with malaria... facts, I was very ill and its possible life threatening... fact... 3 others in my building in punta cana got malaria same month... fact... CDC IS INVOLED fact... Kitchener Waterloo Public Health is involved ... fact..... I'm still sick, 2 month later... fact I did not take meds... fact... I will be from now on... fact.... have to go to a infectious disease specials, for weekly blood exams....fact...

"NO stretching facts there mojito, "
"GREEN, in short, will you be cured? Or will you always have this in your blood?"
Thank You for the ' heads up'----I really appreciate it. Having had 'tick bite' fever years ago I never want a repeat of any type of tropical fever.Mike Conway
Still have to put 2c in. FACT: there has been a warnings (on BonVoyage.ca) for years about the risk of Malaria in PC.FACT: can't be too many people dying from it here as the ONLY case to make the news (not that she died) was the article posted by Moira.Maybe (since it seemed to be in your biulding only) is was localized to that spot?
"deb, the levels when diagnosed where 5% parasites in blood, last reading last week was .1 percent. I asked that question as well, dr. steingart advised me that it could be there for months... even yrs...as well malaria can reoccur anytime. This particular strain usally doesn't come back. But again, never can donate blood again in my life. Guess that is for a reason???? Again please contact the proper auth. and let us all know what you find out bout my case. "
Again I am sorry for your situation. I know those are facts (again sorry). But there other facts as well.
"mohito you have to be kidding, one notice on it ... LOL go googling... STATISTICS ON MALARIAMalaria is one of the planet's deadliest diseases and one of the leading causes of sickness and death in the developing world. According to the World Health Organization there are 300 to 500 million clinical cases of malaria each year resulting in 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths. Children aged one to four are the most vulnerable to infection and death. Malaria is responsible for as many as half the deaths of African children under the age of five. The disease kills more than one million children - 2,800 per day - each year in Africa alone. In regions of intense transmission, 40% of toddlers may die of acute malaria. About 40% of the world's population - about two billion people - are at risk in about 90 countries and territories. 80 to 90% of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where 90% of the infected people live. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest malaria infection rate. Here alone, the disease kills at least one million people each year. According to some estimates, 275 million out of a total of 530 million people have malaria parasites in their blood, although they may not develop symptoms. Of the four human malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common and deadly form. It is responsible for about 95% of malaria deaths worldwide and has a mortality rate of 1-3%. In the early 1960s, only 10% the world's population was at risk of contracting malaria. This rose to 40% as mosquitoes developed resistance to pesticides and malaria parasites developed resistance to treatment drugs. Malaria is now spreading to areas previously free of the disease. Malaria kills 8,000 Brazilians yearly - more than AIDS and cholera combined. There were 483 reported cases of malaria in Canada in 1993, according to Health Canada and approximately 431 in 1994. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States received reports of 910 cases of malaria in 1992 and seven of those cases were acquired there. In 1970, reported malaria cases in the U.S. were 4,247 with more than 4,000 of the total being U.S. military personnel. According to material from Third World Network Features, in Africa alone, direct and indirect costs of malaria amounted to US $800 million in 1987 and are expected to reach US $1.8 billion annually by 1995.

"Green, I will certainly let everyone know what or if I find out anything but I'm not sure I can tell CBC what to do or how they will handle it. My main concern is WHY hasn't the public been informed in a timely manner?A good question was asked about mosquitos and the transmission of malaria so.....still looking to be educated and since you are in direct contact with Chris Steingart, can you ask him since you say you can have this in your blood for months are you considered to be a ""carrier"". And if bitten by an uneffected mosquito can this then be passed on to someone else?Deb"

"The malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts. During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host . Sporozoites infect liver cells and mature into schizonts , which rupture and release merozoites . (Of note, in P. vivax and P. ovale a dormant stage [hypnozoites] can persist in the liver and cause relapses by invading the bloodstream weeks, or even years later.) After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony ), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony ). Merozoites infect red blood cells . The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing merozoites . Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) . Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. The gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal . The parasites’ multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle . While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes generating zygotes . The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts . The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites , which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle. "

"Hi,Don't know if this link has already been posted but here it is.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/…mal_dr080206-eng.phpI too was warned of malaria by by GP 2 years ago when I told her I was going to Punta Cana. You decide."
"Insecticide-based control measures (e.g. indoor spraying with insecticides, ITNs) are the principal way to kill mosquitoes that bite indoors. However, after prolonged exposure to an insecticide over several generations, mosquitoes, like other insects, may develop resistance, a capacity to survive contact with an insecticide. Since mosquitoes can have many generations per year, high levels of resistance can arise very quickly. Resistance of mosquitoes to some insecticides has been documented with just within a few years after the insecticides were introduced. There are over 125 mosquito species with documented resistance to one or more insecticides. The development of resistance to insecticides used for indoor residual spraying was a major impediment during the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign. Judicious use of insecticides for mosquito control can limit the development and spread of resistance. However, use of insecticides in agriculture has often been implicated as contributing to resistance in mosquito populations. It is possible to detect developing resistance in mosquitoes and control programs are well advised to conduct surveillance for this potential problem."
"Greeny....most sprays fogged in the region here are not based on toxins, but on a parafin base which coats the winds of the mossie, thus rendering its ability to fly...much like an airplane with ice on it's wings. CheersPCMike"
"Health Care ProfessionalsHealth care providers needing assistance with diagnosis or management of suspected cases of malaria should call the CDC Malaria Hotline: 770-488-7788 (M-F, 8am-4:30pm, eastern time). Emergency consultation after hours, call: 770-488-7100 and request to speak with a CDC Malaria Branch clinician.B"
"green perhaps you missed my post or I missed your answer..Green, I will certainly let everyone know what or if I find out anything but I'm not sure I can tell CBC what to do or how they will handle it. My main concern is WHY hasn't the public been informed in a timely manner?A good question was asked about mosquitos and the transmission of malaria so.....still looking to be educated and since you are in direct contact with Chris Steingart, can you ask him since you say you can have this in your blood for months are you considered to be a ""carrier"". And if bitten by an uneffected mosquito can this then be passed on to someone else?Deb"
"So they dont die, they just cant fly... can they still feed ???? "
"deb, I did post that response.. But I will ask him. A human can be a carrier, providing the right type and sex of mosquito bites and infected person. It is only the female mosquito... "
"I think you may have misunderstood my question.If ""you"" can have this in ""your"" system for months (carrier), I think that's what you said, could another uneffected mosquito bite you and then pass it on to another human?"
"deb.There are approximately 3,500 species of mosquitoes grouped into 41 genera. Human malaria is transmitted only by females of the genus Anopheles. Of the approximately 430 Anopheles species, only 30-40 transmit malaria (i.e., are ""vectors"") in nature..."
"deb, the answer to that is yes... that is how a mosquito gets it in the first place, she would have had blood meal from an infected person"
"greeneyedbl, interesting information you're providing and quite scary. But can you please post a link to your stated ""fact... malaria is on the rise in punta cana"" ? Thanks.-Brugal"
"Okay, I found the answer...""You can catch malaria if a female of the Anopheles type of mosquito bites someone carrying the malaria parasite and then bites you, passing it on to you.""So, you said that YOU yourself could have this for months and will have to be tested weekly. Will you be doing this when you travel to PC next week?"
"I will be doing this weekly ... until levels are 0.. but with my levels dr. said I cannot pass it on, I did this inquiry as I have children... and run a daycare center... M"
"Brugal... My stats came directly from the cdc, kw public health unit, and a infectious disease dr. all info provided..."
"Thanks greeneyedbl. So there's no actual link supporting the increase, you're basing it off of what you've been told during your ordeal. Correct?So, based on the information you've gathered in your opinion am I at a greater risk traveling today than my last trip in 07? Thanks again!-Brugal"
Here is a good article on Malaria research.http://live.psu.edu/story/37641
"Ummmmmmmmmm, what does Afica have to do with Punta Cana? Did you know you can contract Malaria in Canada?! In Ontario even!!! Here are some more FACTSmysteriesofcanada.com/Canada/malaria_in_cana…This link talks about the two different strains of Malaria. There are also travellers that may contract the ""illness"" in Canada (or US) before they even leave on vacation, and the effects don't show until you return.  Granted if you leave Canada in the winter months there won't be any mosquitos"
I realize the article talks about something many years ago...but It's still a fact! MALARIA in CANADA!!! Watch out! lol
"That's actually a fascinating story. You learn something new everyday, eh? I always drink quinine, I'm a big vodka, tonic kinda gal...lolCheers,Debbie"
"I just called my neighbour (a nurse here in Atlantic Canada) and asked here if she has heard ANYTHING about malaria cases this year....answer..""No, none this year, none last year. And the danger is NO different than previous years."" I don't have a specialist that I can call on a Sunday.  And being from Canada I would not consult the CDC as it is an agency in the US (nothing against at all)  Somewhat like checking the weather in Punta Cana today for my trip in 25 days. I would consult an agency in my own Country like Health Canada, but that's just me"
Thanks MsC!Now that is FACTS. She did some research!
"[Malaria is still a problem in the Dominican Republic, and not only close to the borders with Haiti, as Punta Cana is at the eastern tip of the country. The Dominican Republic reported 1233 cases of malaria to PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) in 2000, which trippled in 2005 to 3837 and slightly declined to 3525 in 2006, the last year for which data is available.

Found this on the Foriegn Affairs page (Gov't of Canada... WARNINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS There is no Official Warning for this country. (Refering to DR)And this page was updated on Feb.25. 2009
"Over the last decade there has been a marked increase in cases of drug-resistant and severe malaria in Canadian travellers. We report 7 deaths due to falciparum malaria that occurred in Canada or in Canadian travellers. Risks for malaria infection include inappropriate recommendations for malaria prevention by health care providers and lack of knowledge about or adherence to appropriate recommendations by the travelling public. Risks for death include delays in seeking medical attention, delays in diagnosis and inadequate care by Canadian physicians and hospitals, and lack of access to parenteral therapy for severe malaria. Malaria infections and deaths are preventable. Better education of health care providers and travellers about the risks of malaria and appropriate prevention and treatment measures may decrease this unnecessary burden on the Canadian health care system.link biblioteca.universia.net/ficha.do?id=17634257"
"Yes it's fact you got it. (can't say I'm sorry anymore times) But you also posted some misleading ""FACTS"" and you have yet to back them up.  TA''s ""Motto get the truth out there"" , the truth is, it's no worse than any other year.Traveller's should talk to their OWN doctor."
Since 2005-2007 the DR averages about 3500 malaria cases a year. Thats up about 1000 more cases a year versus 2000-2004 malaria cases.. The malaria death rate is about 15 a year.www.who.int/malaria/wmr2008/malaria2008.pdf

That's right Orange.
Medical authorities are warning travellers heading to parts of the Dominican Republic after a Quebec woman caught malaria in the popular resort destination of Punta Cana.www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/305012
"MsC, The most important part on that page is ""there are NO warnings "" right now"
"Looking at that closer johnandjulie26, according to the W.H.O. website cases in the D.R.have dropped over the past few years.2005- 3,837 cases2006- 3,525 cases2007- 2,711 casesUnless 2008 bucked that trend this whole thread is starting to worry me less and less.-Brugal"
Never worried from the start.  So who's up for a trip to STEVE'S? First round on me!! 
"Mohito,DFAIT does NOT provide information on health matters for the Canadian government, that is left to the Public Health Agency of Canada, hence the paragraph I quoted where it says, the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends.......As for the There is no Official Warning for this country, that you refer to, it has to be read with the little table below containing the information:. Exercise normal security precautions Exercise high degree of caution Avoid non-essential travel Avoid all travel Travellers to the Dominican Republic should exercise a high degree of caution, since the crime rate has increased.That refers to the level of polical instablity/strife in the country. For the DR it is now set at Exercise high degree of caution. It has nothing to do with the health situation or malaria situation.Re. taking of meds or non-taking of meds, I believe it's up to the individual traveller to make that choice, but please if you're going to ""quote"" govt information, please use the correct one."
"Yes I am aware (relative works there). But if there were ANY serious dangers to Canadian's travelling there would be a record of it somewhere. As Brugal noticed, the stats where dropping.  "
The info on that page also has not changed since I went on my last trip to the DR last year. Most is common sence.
Found this too:…about.com/library/weekly/aa122101a.htmVery intersting. :)
"Today, a reported 1200 Canadians come down with ""imported malaria"" each year, after returning to Canada from malaria endemic areas. These cases can be treated when the presence of malaria is identified, but there have been a number of deaths in the last few years due to delays in diagnosing the disease and obtaining the drugs required to treat it.link...findarticles.com/p/…ai_n28800616Health authorities believe the reported numbers underestimate the actual total, which is more likely to be 2000 to 3000 cases a year. This number will grow as more Canadians travel to malaria endemic areas, and as the percentage of the world's population living in malaria endemic areas increases with climate change -- from 45 percent at present to a predicted 60 percent by the year 2100."
Are those cases of Canadians who've contracted malaria broken down by country visited and if so how many came from visiting the D.R and specifically Punta Cana? Since this is a Punta Cana forum I'd find that most helpful.-Brugal
"How this got so out of hand is beyond me... I can on here to share my experience... I contracted malaria, along with 3 of my frinds 2 month ago in punta cana... 3 out of 7 people that were together...Granted I stayed off resort.. but only by 250 meters... 2 minute walk, mosquitos fly.. I have provided the names of agencies to contact if your in denial, call find out for yourself. As far as im concerned, I could care less if you take the meds or not.. If you want to get violently ill... go right ahead, first hand from myself who is still recovering, its not pleasant at all not to mention all the time off work, in bed, in hospitals, feeling like a pin cushion, all the calls from public health agencys and cdc agency. Those of you who are interested and want to hear REAL LIFE, read my original post. and take the information for its face value. I provided info on all the agency's whom have been involved. And for all of you who just want to argue the FACTS... TAKE IT TO ANOTHER THREAD. Some people on here are here for information and others imput, not a job as some do nothing else. My email is greeneyedbl@hotmail.com if you would like to get contact numbers..Cheers"
"I personally read every page of this thread. i am not minimizing your health concern or what you are saying. Now on the other hand, how do I personally know that I can trust what you say? Who is to say that you don't in fact work for a pharmaceutical company trying to put fear in people to buy the meds? I don't know you at all! I too also believe that if in fact it were ""rampant"" in PC we would be hearing alot more about it. Look at SARS, it wasn't even rampant but you couldn't turn the news on or read a newspaper without it being shoved in your face.I have been in and out of hospitals and doctors offices for 2 mnths now & I have told every single one of them that I was in DR in Nov. No one batted an eye? I would think that if Kitchener public health was aware of a rampant malarial problem in DR that all healthcare professionals would be informed.My aunt is a nurse, I will ask her if they are informed of these types of issues when they become a frequent problem.Thank you for informing us."
"News from the Caribbean as of Sunday March 1, 2009here something I just came across... According to Reuters, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the warning after 17 cases of the mosquito-borne disease surfaced among U.S., Canadian and European tourists who had visited La Altagracia and Duarte provinces in the Caribbean nation.Public health authorities are once again reminding Canadian travellers thinking of a tropical getaway to the Dominican Republic that they need to take anti-malarial medication. But many travellers say they haven't been getting the message. Despite the advisory, many travellers say they are not being warned by their travel agents of the risks. Natalie Basil went to the Dominican Republic last December for the sun and the sand, but came down with malaria symptoms within weeks of returning home. The kind of malaria that she developed can be fatal in three of four days. She was sick for several weeks but eventually recovered. In November, a couple from Germany, both 71, developed malaria after travelling to Punta Cana, despite regularly using mosquito repellent. Neither had taken anti-malaria pills.

Well I have new flash, its there and people need to know so that they can go, and go prepared. People can make up their own minds.. PUNTA CANA is my favourite destination and I will never stop going, but now can go with facts, and make a decission on taking the pills or not. If someone changes their mind about going, yes they will miss a beautiful country, but in no way did I make then not go? Its kinda like playing russian roulette, I would not put a gun to my head and pull trigger knowing there is one bullet in the pistol?? I agree the thread is getting out of hand, but in no way was that my issue, I was here to tell the truth..Would you go to africa without taking all precautions? I would not.. cheers"

"greeneyedbl, I want to apologize. You'd think at 43 I'd have learned to let things slide a little more than I have. Oh well. No one should have to go through what you're going through. I can't even imagine what it must be like. Thank you for coming on here to inform people of your experience. My initial interest in this thread was to try and determine if the risk of malaria for visitors of the D.R. is increasing. From what I've determined it's inconclusive but I can sure see how you'd feel otherwise. Again I'm sorry for acting like an A$$. I should know better.Have a GREAT trip!!!-Brugal"
"brugal for the last 10 yrs going to p/c I have never taken meds, nor did I in dec.. I decided this time I will be taking them, I never want to go through malaria again thought it was the end..lol.. I think to each his own but to actually know it is there and there is a risk, but believe me I will never stop going, in fact I want to spend 3 months there this winter, and will but with meds, its only once a week pill so think I can handle that... I will have a great time, its just me and a girlfriend, hubbys are staying home.. ;) heehee... go girls... cheersmichelle"
