"Hello,My family (wife and 2 kids 2 years old and 4 months old) are planning to fly into Boston over Labor Day from Texas. Being a high risk state we will be getting our covid tests beforehand but am wondering if the kids would also need to be tested? Presumably if we don’t have it neither would the kids as they are both at home with us right now and it’s a fairly invasive test. I can’t see anything online that spells this out so wanted to check with this forum.ThanksSebastian"
"From mass. gov: Testing for children, 10 years and younger, who are traveling with an adult from their household is not required.https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-t…"
"Not sure what the testing turnaround is, but also bear in mind that you will be required to quarantine until you get your negative test result. The full language:You do not need to quarantine for 14 days if you took a test for COVID-19 and have received a negative result. The specimen for the test must have been collected no longer than 72 hours before your arrival in Massachusetts, and the testing must be by a method approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Upon request, you must be able to demonstrate proof of the negative test result.If you took a test prior to your arrival but have not received your negative result, you MUST quarantine until you receive the negative result. You may obtain a test at your own expense after your arrival in Massachusetts, but you MUST quarantine until you obtain a negative result. Use the COVID-19 testing map to find a site near you. Information about approved molecular tests can be found in the Department of Public Health Guidance. A negative result from an antigen test must be confirmed by a negative result from an FDA EUA-approved molecular (PCR) SARS-CoV2 test, on a sample obtained 72 hours or less prior to arrival in Massachusetts. Serology tests will not be accepted.Visitors are strongly urged to obtain a negative result before traveling to Massachusetts.Testing for children, 10 years and younger, who are traveling with an adult from their household is not required."
My daughter and I are coming from Ohio. I am researching the 72 hour turn around in our area. Some of them are taking 3-4 days.. for results.
