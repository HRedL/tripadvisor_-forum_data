"A Chicagoan, who is retired, and lives year round in Aca stated the latest today. No one wears a mask, social distancing is nonexistent and no one can purchase beer anywhere. He believes it will be a long time until the city reopens.Edited: 10:02 am, May 27, 2020 "
Then it will be a long time before any of us return.
It is the new reality we must accept. Probably no Acapulco or any travel till a vaccine is found if that is even possible. I pray to God my friends in Mexico make it trough this.
"The state of Guerrero is a mess. Sad to learn they're surpassing EDOMEX in hospital bed occupancy. That in itself is more then alarming.Edited: 11:33 am, May 27, 2020 "
"Beer is sparse, and there is price gouging for sure.ACAPULCO.- Dado al desabasto de algunas bebidas alcohólicas como es el de la cerveza, usuarios se han quejado debido a que establecimientos que aún cuentan con el producto han aumentado los precios “arbitrariamente” hasta en un 100 por ciento sin que la Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (Profeco) actúe contra ellos.A través de las redes sociales, acapulqueños manifestaron su inconformidad ya que en misceláneas, los minisupers, tiendas de conveniencia e incluso supermercados, los precios han tenido un aumento de hasta 30 pesos dependiendo de cada una de las marcas.“Dónde está la Profeco para sancionar a esa gente que está abusando de que no hay producto, están vendiendo los cartones de cerveza hasta en 600 pesos, cuando antes estaban en 240”, comentó Ángel Nájera.Por su parte, Gilberto Zamora Jiménez denunció que en depósitos de zonas como La Garita, avenida Universidad, colonia Vista Hermosa y la Progreso han incrementado sus precios en toda la venta de vinos y licores, bajo el argumento de que las autoridades han restringido el horario para comercializar ésta.“No importa si vas a comprar una botella en horario permitido, los encargados te la dan más cara que porque ya no los dejan vender después de las ocho de la noche; me gustaría saber qué están haciendo las autoridades, la Profeco no se ha pronunciado hasta el momento”, comentó."
"Stay safe, Ricky. I tried to convince Fernando Jr., to take this stuff seriously and he ""un-friended"" me. Didn't want to scare off any possible BnB guests I guess, and then BnB screwed the hosts anyway. I, too, fear for our friends. Not many of the old timers left. Tacho gone. Kalamazoo Harry gone. BlindBill has not been back to Aca since his mom died and his sisters sold the home and probably parked Bill in a care home. His # is out of service and he can't use a computer. All that before this pandemic. By the time we can get back to Aca my dog will have passed and I'll be a snowbird. Better times are coming."
I saw the bad news about ACA today. So Sad. Another congested urban area devastated. So difficult to witness.
"Well hope and i think that will not be the case. I am going in January 2021, if I have to walk. Life has to go on, staying inside and at home and out of work until if and when a vaccine is found, is sheer madness. Millions will die from other causes.Time for Herd Immunity IMO and back to Life.Good luck to everyone and see you all on the Princess Beach."
"Like I posted Snork, I'm there in January if I have to walk or swim to get there Amigo."
"Too early for me to write January off. Keep us posted, Heat."
News as of today in the Toronto Sun paper. Acapulco hospitals and health care system has completely broken down.

"That's scary and sad, Ron. Doesn't look like they can flatten that curve anytime soon."
"Stay safe my friends. There will be a vaccine at some point but winter looks tough. Herd mentality is great if you do not have any pre existing conditions.  I have a buddy in great shape at work pass from this at 50 do not think it cannot get you.  I work every day and shop when i have too and have been fortunate but don't take this lightly.Edited: 8:36 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"You're front line, Truck. Hope cases in your area are not on the rise, too. Vaccine would be nice, but even an effective treatment would be reassuring. Go science. If there is a treatment or vaccine I hope to hell they make it accessible to everyone, worldwide, no charge. Big pharma owns a lot of politicians. Insulin was discovered by two Canadians, Banting and Best, who refused to patent the drug to make it available to everyone. Salk did the same with the polio vaccine. I can't see any heroes, yet, on the research side, but I trust and hope that whoever finds the cure will act like a decent human being."
Mi Piaci is open with limited outdoor dining. Raquel’s is closed.Anka and Elsie are doing well.

"And I bet the Governor knows how to get good medical care. Tourists don't even know how bad the hospitals are in Guerrero...mention it to them...they ask about retiring in Zihua...and they seem shocked at first...then get po'd for mentioning a negative. Comments are always...OH just because YOU WISH you could retire there? I have seen the inside of the best hospital in Zihua...and I am glad that I was able to walk out of there...then to my apartment with the hospital owner...then to the bank...so I could get the money to pay him off...not sure what would have happened if I didn't have the money...probably back to jail!!! That's another not nice place...especially when your landlord messes up things and dumps you there! Street smart really quick!! Friends and lawyers and got out with him saying...OH JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE DUMB BLOND. All he wanted was enough money for the electric bill (included!!!)...so he could go back to his home in Chille!! Got an order of protection...and he could not come back to Ixtapa until I left.Edited: 6:23 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"Res — Thanks for the post. Sad news, as she was yet another local icon.Here's a post from a few months ago when someone inquired about those BV restaurants:https:/…105504490And a link to Juana la Cubana's FB page, with further (recent) posts concerning her mom's passing:https://www.facebook.com/ciralamorena2/"
Hi! That was my post inquiring about Cira La Morena and family. We were scheduled to visit next week. I was looking forward to meeting the icon. Prayers to the family. Looking forward to returning to Aca in July.
July? That town is really struggling with the Covid Virus. Restaurants and Hotels are mostly closed. Booze in limited supply You might double check before you go
The Governor (who has tested positive for the virus) signed a new decree yesterday. Face masks are required in ALL public areas and all indoor areas. A task force is going around putting up signs at the smallest of vendors who will be fined for not enforcing.
"Most economical and efficient way to prevent transmission...other than staying put. Shouldn't have to enforce. Respect for others, especially the aged, is more common in Mexicans than northerners may think. Public education would be the way to go."
Restaurants in Caleta and on the Costera attempt to get ready for a possible July 1 opening.https:/…
Grupo Brisas just announced the same date for opening.
Still hoping for January. Stay at Club Del Sol 2 -3 months every winter. Not giving up yet.
"Jogee, you must be friends with Grant, he used to stay there all the time and hangs there still."
"General testing sites opening up throughout the city, 16 in all. For anyone who has shown symptoms in/for the past 7 days. https:/…"
"Use the southern U.S. as an example of what not to do. There is not sufficient testing and tracing capability, no definite therapy and no vaccine. Open up, kill a bunch more people and then close down again for twice as long. Madness."
"A post from a person living here who tried to get the free Covid test offered (this is not a post from tripdvisor) ; Well it is a start but not very much good. I tried today waiting in line for a couple of hours, to be number 29 of 30 to be tested, only to find out when it was my turn for the lengthy questionnaire, just to be REJECTED because it is only for Mexicans, foreigners like me from Canada need to pay for a test at private lab"
Not surprising for sure. Does the person have symptoms?
"That sounds fair. A Canadian should realize our health care system is only free in Canada, Doh! Hope you and your family are doing well, Dray."
"I assumed he was either perm or temp res. here. After asking him if he was a res he did not say yes or no but only said I should ask before standing in line. Perhaps he stays here on a 6 month visa. Yes, snork, we are doing well...thanks for asking. (He did not mention if he had symptoms)Edited: 5:59 pm, June 30, 2020 "

https:/…Report from the first sampling...........not looking promising.
"Just as color AcaRes - NJ had the same sort of horrible positive results in the first rounds of testing, b/c the low number of tests and the high bar to be tested. Its only as the testing gets more widespread and the requirements for testing lessen (e.g. no symptoms but was in contact with someone who has it) that you will see a much lower (and more representative) positive return.Edited: 12:33 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"No matter how you slice it, ACA still has a ways to go before tourists feel safe enough to return. Just as we do NOTB. Sad, but that's reality (for now)."
"Chanclas on the Ground update- Angels is opening today, as is Combat Wings, and a few other places.... Mezcalina is opening on the 15th..... the streets have waaaay more cars than I've seen the last few months - and a few people have invited me for pozole tomorrow. Meanwhile my home state of Cali just closed a ton of businesses and had 2 days in a row of highest positive tests. Sooo... ya"
"Stay safe Nick. I think this is a case of use your head. If there is a place that looks like they are tossing caution to the wind, avoid. NJ is doing well, but given CA/AZ/TX/FL just killed the dining inside plans for a while more."
This sure doesn't help our decisions to return any time soon!
"Unfortunately Mexico hasn't even peaked yet, but then again neither has the US. Talk about having fall and winter travel plans in limbo. For many that is the light at the end of the tunnel and right now that end of the tunnel has collapsed. Among many concerns are, when will there be a vaccination readily available to all including Mexico and what will be left of the tourist structure if and when it is safe to return. I don't like change and my biggest fear is that many of my favorite bars/restaurants and the friendly people we have gotten to know there will be history."
"You're right, Ted. Unlike the rest of the world, the U.S., Mexico, Brazil and a few others failed to listen to the scientists. Their ""leaders"" put political expediency ahead of the lives of their people and made their situations ten fold worse. Nothing short of a complete lock down for at least a month, and spending the millions needed on testing and tracing, will allow any sort of recovery. Any possible vaccine will only have an efficacy rate of about 50%. There is no treatment except Remdesivir and the U.S. has one supplier charging $3400 for a treatment that costs $6 to manufacture. They ain't giving it to Mexico.In Canada, as in every other country dealing with this pandemic, some businesses will fail and some will survive. Demand has collapsed. When people feel safe enough to do business again, demand will slowly increase and if the surviving businesses don't have capacity, new businesses will fill the gap."
"Snork, where are you seeing that ""Any possible vaccine will only have an efficacy rate of about 50%""The guidelines I have seen is that is the minimum acceptable level for a vaccine to be approved, not necessarily the actual level of success."
Dr. Fauci.
Last week week we drove 40min. to Niagara Falls played tourist for the day All businesses were open very few people entering the shops and restaurants with the border being closed it makes it tough on the business CBC just announced the border will be closed until the end of the year.With such a short season they need that monetary flow in the summer to get them threw the rest of the yearBoth sides of the border are hurting.
Remdesivir and tocilizumab are both being used. USA Today- 150 treatment and 50 antivirals are currently in play. The entire world is trying to find a solution. Of course some people feel the need to attempt unwarranted political statements. They are the same that have done so before and we mostly ignore.
"Ok, when? Because in recent interviews he has said he would settle for a vaccine that has an effectiveness rate in the 70%-75% range. But he has never to my knowledge actually given numbers on the efficacy, as they are only know going into stage three testing. He said Moderna's vaccine has shown ""very promising"" results ""which makes me cautiously optimistic, although you could never, ever predict with any certainty whether a vaccine is going to be safe and effective.""https:/…76825090.cmsCan you post where you saw him saying ""only 50%""? Thanks, much appreciated."
"The flu vaccine each year has a 30 to 50% efficacy...and it is reformulated every year as the viral threats are reassessed. Fauci would be happy with any efficacy for Covid 19 but he acknowledges that almost 25% of the U.S. public seems to reject the notion of vaccines, outright. That would be the end of any viable vaccine program. Anti-vaxers and conspiracy theorists are destroying any hope that vaccination is the way to go. So sad that the cooperation needed to deal with this pandemic is absent in 25% of the population. I'm not anti-merican and I know that the majority of my U.S. cousins can't wait to get rid of the current stupidity. I love them all. It's the dismall few that we can all do without."
Don't fool yourself thinking any one particular country has cornered the market on stupidity.
Getting rid of the current stupidity doesn’t mean the 25% is going to fall in line crazy as it may sound some may have more fear of the vaccine then the virus.
LOL @ Ted. Definitely stealing that one liner for sure!!!!
"Mike, what have you heard lately from your ""Chicagoan"" friend?Any big changes?"
"I do not believe that the ignorance of the anti vac folks is 25% maybe in liberal Austin, Tx near where I live. Most people are smarter."
"Always good to check in here, To see what the smartest man in the world has to say about State of Mind of the American Public, And his recommendation on everything"
"Hopefully they are also smart enough to know is that 98.9% of people who become infected, thankfully do not Die and do not even enter the Hospital. Yes those who are very elderly or have chronic, serious pre-existing health conditions, or a BMI over 30 (another reason to go to the Gym) must be very careful, but otherwise you do not need to worry if you are not in that category.Good luck to everyone, but I am there in January 2020 if I can be."
"Heat, that is misinformation. Per the WHO:""What percentage of patients with COVID-19 need to be hospitalized?Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment, and for the majority – especially for children and young adults – illness due to COVID-19 is generally minor. However, for some people it can cause serious illness.Around 1 in every 5 people who are infected with COVID-19 develop difficulty in breathing and require hospital care""https://www.who.int/indonesia/news/detail/08…"
"I agree with Rob. Long term effects are a big unknown, too. We are learning as we go. The virus needs a host and I'm not feeling that generous."
This made me shake my head “but otherwise you do not need to worry if you are not in that category.”
"""""I do not believe that the ignorance of the anti vac folks is 25% maybe in liberal Austin, Tx near where I live. Most people are smarter.""""It is the Christian right that are anti-vax, as they don't want foreign bodies put into them. So a large swath of parts of the USA.Coupled with the fact that vaccines do not work on everybody (you can research that yourself) it will be hard to get to herd immunity."

"Really, Mike? That's the way you respond to anyone that is trying to help people? I can visualize Hank's face, but I keep hearing Homer Simpson's voice (lol). You, I thought had something to add. Be like Lisa. Homer is a poor role model."
I live in Austin ETJ it is Liberal and Democratic. No doubt. So is another town where he lives. San Marcos. One of the prettiest towns in Texas.  I do not see the reason for bringing in Religion. Explain why. The Anti Vac folks are entitled to their opinions as well. There is no reason To swipe at them. None Oh and Yes I will stand with Hank.
"Thanks Mike Don’t know why I was attacked , I simply made a statement on why I read TA daily"
"I live in San Marcos, TX and am not a liberal?"
Probably not sir. But I would bet the folks at the school would be different. If I could afford a place on the river we would probably live there. No offense intended.
