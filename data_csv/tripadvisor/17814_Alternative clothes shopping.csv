"Hi!I'm looking for shops that sell alternative clothing and accessories related to rock, metal, punk... Couldn't find anything on Google :(Or specifically if anyone knows where I can find an authentic looking punk leather jacket.... Or a better place to ask this kind of question :)Thanks!"
"One thing that I noticed on my last visit to Riga, last month was, that everyone seemed so coservatively dressed. I didn't see any women or men of any age who were tattooed or pierced. I doubt very much if you'll find the clothes that you're looking for."
"I'm not sure about that, XchocolateX, I saw a fair few last week, plus a number of goths, so you must be able to get such clothes somewhere. Tattoos have certainly not reached the epidemic levels you get in many other parts of europe, however."
