I'm heading to albufeira for a stag do on the 20th of March next week was wondering about the place will it be open is there any point going what's the issue atm can somebody help me out cheers
"Alex, please read the current threads running on the forum.Nobody can tell you what the situation will be in a weeks time. However, the clubs are closed and some restaurants etc are closing voluntarily."
No worries cheers
Several threads if you open the Algarve forum.......https:/…ShowForum-g189111-i330-Algarve.html
Tbh I'd give it a miss
"All the evidence is people are NOT giving it a miss .. but they will be giving Spain a big wide berth, which meansAlgarve will be a bit busier. This week is normally quietand no surprise that some bars and restaurants dont think it worthwhile to open. The Cottage on the stripsays he is busier than previous years ... planes are coming in almost full ... dont give up unless you really have to .."
HiWe got back today and no bars had closed yesterday but some did say the were keeping an eyeopen to see what others were going to do Bill
"With the rapidly changing situation, increasing restrictions it would be naive to think that the situstion in Portugal will remain unchanged., new restrictions could be applied within hours , days or weeks.I would not book flights to go anywhere even Portugal for the foreseeable future.The government has demonstrated that the needs of the Population are a higher priority than that of tourists or the tourist industry.Anyone who has booked a holiday and expects late nights, vibrant nightlife , busy streets, shops, cafes, bars etc should think again.Portugal will not benefit from the virus , it will suffer just as much as everywhere else.Spain could go into a total lockdown next week, Portugal is not immune. Anyone who thinks otherwise is living on another planet."
terry do u no what praia de roche is like please at the moment open or closing at 12
Closing at 11.00pm as per current regulations.
thts fine 4 me i dont do clubs etc so 11 b fine aslong as supermarkets etc couple of bars ill b fine
Just been announced on Portuguese TV that under government mandate all bars (not sure if this involves restaurants as well) have to close at 9pm until at least the 9th April. That covers all of Portugal and the Algarve.https:/…
That will have severe economic repercussions but is further proof that the welfare and health of the Portuguese comes before entertaining tourists.
"People also need to take into account if anyone in the hotel complex shows any symptoms or takes ill the whole building will be in lockdown regardless....and you won't be alowed outEdited: 5:38 pm, March 14, 2020 "

"No point in slating Terry. This is a worldwide crisis and is escalating fast Albufeira is not immune. I love Albufeira and visit several times a year, however right now I wouldn't be considering foreign travel to anywhere."
"This discussion has nothing to do with Albufeira.What is happening There is happening across the Algarve in fact across Europe.Europe is shutting down.How long for no one knows.What will emerge after the crisis again no one knows..It's no good pretending anything else.George V, famously said ""bugger bognor"".Went there once , think I was 8 at the time.."
its not about slating terry its what he says to people which is wrong and is known for not liking albufeira no offence to you but he shouldnt be saying things he does ie talk english i report him if i wanted to but im a man not a mouse and yes i agree albufeira is not immuine to the virus
Did you decide to go? I'm supposed to be going on 21st but cant decide whether or not to postpone!!!!
"I read that bars now have to close at 9pm, restaurants 11pm. This was brought into action yesterday by the government."
All bars including hotel bars in Ireland have been closed from tonight for two weeks and i would be afraid the same will happen in theAlgarve if the virus continues to accelerate at the present speed.
"In Ireland the Govenernment have implemented a social distancing policy which just did not work in the pubs, with St Patricks Day tomorrow it was the sensible thing to close them. Hopefully if we all stay calm and unfortunately, at home, for a month or two the worst should pass and things can start to get back to normal. Without doubt some businesses in Albufeira will be victims of the virus too unfortunately."
"Do not travel/fly out here! Most restaurants and bars shut in Armação de Pera. See my post on the Faro Forum. Many restrictions already in place with more to follow in next few days. We’re leaving tomorrow, 5 days earlier than originally booked."
Thanks for all the updates sunandbeach. Glad you managed to get early flights home. Stay safe x
"sunandbeach - glad you managed to get earlier flights home. Thankyou for posting about situation over there as well, feel better now about our decision to cancel and lose the deposit last night. My neighbour is in a spanish hotel on lockdown. Not much of a holiday!Safe journey home sunandbeach ...hope you make it onto the plane before any further developments / restrictions.( Over here in UK ....Son says in Worcester some university halls of residence are also on lockdown since yesterday, an employee of his wasn't allowed out for work. Situation being reviewed in 7 days and possibly closing the whole campus uni and making everyone go back to their homes. )Edited: 8:01 am, March 16, 2020 "
Thanks for your replies. Unless you’re actually here at the moment its difficult to imagine how serious it really is. Our heated hotel pool is still in use (personally think it should be closed) in line with public pools) And the beach virtually empty.
Hi I'm goin to Portugal in September and goin near sesmarius is it goin to be safe by then goin with my mates xx
"Sarah, nobody can possibly tell you how this situation is going to pan out. We can only hope that all is well, as quickly as possible."
We returned yesterday. Over the last few days more and more measures came in such as having to leave alternate tables free. We felt lucky to be coming home as flights are likely to be cancelled soon.
"Sarah a... it’s a waiting game this one.. I’m coming to albufeira in June, but won’t know if flights get cancelled until leading up to our date... best you speak with whoever you booked with... most companies are updating by the day regarding flights, lockdowns etcEdited: 1:14 pm, March 16, 2020 "
We were there yesterday for coffee and some shopping. Certainly enough open.
