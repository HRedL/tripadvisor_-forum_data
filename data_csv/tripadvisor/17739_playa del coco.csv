you can help me i going there march this year you can told me what the best place to visiting around playa del coco thank you
"Hola papillon607,There are many good restaurants in Playas del Coco ... Le Coq is a lebanese that has great food, The Hotel Coco Palms & Restaurant has great sushi and and fresh fish as well as other selections... Cafe de Playa, Tiki Coco and La Ankla are all good. too The Rincon de la Vieja volcano for hot springs, mud baths zip lines and more as well as Rio Perdido for similar activities ... Lomas del Mar offers horseback riding on the beach and the hills above the beach, sunset sailing / snorkel cruise on the Marlin, Spirit of the Ocean or other sailboat (there are several here)... and this is the TA list for activities and providers that has lots of other options tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g309243-Activiti…pura vida and enjoy,Randy Spate owner Dream On Sportfishing"
Nice also to visit places around Palya Hermosa…What is not good around there is wasting your money in any sport fishing trip…for great fishing…check TAMARINDO beach…check TAMARINDO SPORT FISHING…ask for Randy Wilson…and his wife Petra…they know the area…well over 30 years fishing our waters….great boat…not old pangs…with noisy engines…and leaking oil all over the place…Hotel hacienda Guachiplein by Rincon de la Vieja Volcano…just 1.5 hours from Coco beach…Do not pay anything in advance until you know who you may be dealing with…some people were sting by some irresponsible operator during the holidays…roadadbvisor
"Here's the list of activities and providers in Tamarindo and their reviews from trip advisor users...there are several other fishing options if you choose to drive an hour each way... tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g309253-Activiti…pura vida and enjoy,Randy Spate owner Dream On Sportfishing"
By Monkey trail to Tamarindo around 45 minutes…from Coco to fishing areas more than 2 hours if you are lucky…IMHO better to ride a car for 45 mints than riding a boat to get to fishing areas…that may be good for boat owners…laughing all the way to the bank!Good about our beaches is that we have incredible nice number of boats…from old pangs to real sport fishing boats with Penn International…and nice engines…Good idea check reviews…avoid terrible boat with terrible review of course!roadaddvisor
thank you very much for the volcano wich the best for visiting
thank you Randy you can told me for the volcano and tropical forest wish the best from playa del coco thank you againEdited: 5 years ago 
Do not visit café de playa.Owners are involved in a timeshare real estate scam.
"the closest volcano is Rincon de la Vieja and you can hike, horseback ride, atv, zip line, hot springs mud baths and more there ... Arenal is the most visited and requires an overnight stay to really enjoy since it's a long drive each way... Rincon is only about 90 minutes or so from Coco... Pura vida and enjoy,Randy Spate owner Dream On Sportfishing"
"thank you very much for help me you do not suggest me to café de la playa thank for let me know so appreciate ,if you have any suggestion let me know my trip is in march have good day"
hey Randy for the money if i have Americain money is oké and for 5.00dollars americain how many colonne s thank you
"Hola again ,.... the last exchange rate I saw was 533 to 1 US dollar ... a few days ago when I paid my employees.. so at that rate $5.00 = 2665 colones ... many places work on the 500 to 1 rate and then you would have 2500 coloones ... I just got back from buying gas and on the pumps they say $1 = 520 ... so it will vary depending on what the business wants to offer... it's a little complicated because of all those factors.pura vida,Randy"
thank you so much Randy have a good day in Canada today is very cold
"Hola again ... Here's the accuweather link so you can see our forecast accuweather.com/en/…1180067pura vida,Randy"
You might want to spend an afternoon at Tabacon Hot Springs Thermal Spa.
"Why would you travel 4 hours to sit in hot springs when you can do the same thing less than 2 hours away! Just about everything you can do in the Arenal area, you can do a LOT closer to Playas del Coco."
Just offering my personal preference. IMO Tabacon is upstream and we all know what floats downstream.
"I just don't see that Tabacon is any better than, for instance, Rio Perdido which has beautiful hot springs and doesn't experience the hordes of day trippers on huge buses that show up at Tabacon. So if you are talking about ""what floats downstream"" I would be a lot more concerned about going into hot springs with hundreds of other people.I can't imagine what you think Tabacon would have that would make it worth spending 8 hours in a vehicle.Edited: 5 years ago "
"At risk of being redundant, just my personal preference."
"I can understand that, Bowsner, I was just trying to save them 4 hours of travel time.If you have been to both Rio Perdido and Tabacon, it would be useful if you could do some comparisons for us."
"Hola papillon607,Both Tabacon and Rio Perdido are great to visit, but not sure how long you'll be here in Costa Rica The Arenal area is one of the most popular and the volcano is as majestic as any on earth. I have been to both and I do recommend at least an overnight stay in Arenal if you choose to check it out ... So much to see and do here that it is impossible to see and do it all in one trip.pura vida and enjoy,Randy Spate owner Dream On Sportfishing"
"Il y a beaucoup de Québecois. Tiki Coco, Pizzeria André. Va faire du snorkeling. Amène toi beaucoup d argent. 5$ la bière le soir. Sinon 8$ pour un 6 pack a l'épicerie. il y a des hotels a 40$ corrects."
BOSNER thank you to let all us know about people related to Time Shares…that is really a embarrassing situation…support by some people…of course they make money…once again thank you!Time share is epidemic around Coco…Ocoal and Hermosa!roadadfsior

"merci Michel il y a tu d,autre place que tu peux me conseiller à aller visiter lors de mon séjour la bas merci Francine"
hey the tabacon hot spring thermal spa near playa del coco thank you
"Hola again papillon607,Tabacon and Arenal are about 4 hours or more each way from Coco and require at least one overnight to really enjoy it without being dead dog tired from that long drive.pura vida and enjoy,Randy"
hola Randy it me again  Monteverde cloud forest is to far from playa del coco and you know if he have a bus tour for visit thi place my friend told me is suppose beautiful and the santa rosa national park what do you think for thes places thank you again my friend from Costa Rica
"Hola again papillon607,Monteverde is far like Arenal and would also require an overnight stay to actually enjoy it ... Santa Rosa Park has the historical museum La Casona and offers interesting hiking and beaches if you have a 4 x 4 to reach them and Rincon de la Vieja has the volcano, hot springs mud baths waterfalls, hiking birds and more.Both easy to do day trips from Coco ... Also consider Barra Honda National Park near Nicoya with the explorable caves ... The country is so diverse, I'd recommend seeing all you can see in the time you are here! pura vida and enjoy,Randy Spate owner Dream On Sportfishing"
"There's really no need for a 4x4 if you go to La Casona in Santa Rosa National Park. In fact, the road is paved from the main highway -- Rt 1 -- to La Casona. If you go into the Park from the northern entrance, yes a 4x4 is necessary and sometimes that won't be enough. But to visit La Casona, you enter at the southern entrance and no 4x4 is necessary."
"Nicoya is far from playa del coco because i don ,have a car not sure my husband he want drive different country but is possible make a tour in bus or different transport but safe thank you again"
"Hey Randy, would you know if my pal Captain Bruno is still running snorkel tours out of Coco Bay?"
hey Randy you know if he have coffe plantation near playa del coco and chocolatery thank you again Francine
"Hola BOWSNER88,i have never heard of a Captain Bruno here, so I have no clue... pura vida,Randy"
"Hola Francine,I don't know of any that are nearby but that doesn't mean there aren't any... I would contact one of the tour operators in this area like Avispas Adventures ... they would know for sure.. pura vida and welcome to paradise!Randy"
"thank you Randy for your help can,t wait visit your paradise all people going ther he want retire there may be me too have a good day Francine pura vida"
"They are crooks. Do not accept any free offers. They will pull a sales pitch on you and keep you there for hours until you sign or pay something to them. Then you cannot recover your money. They are all so convincing.If you go, the resort is ok, about 3 stars out of 5. But do not, do not go to any breakfast, lunch,dinner, tour, or anything they offer as you may become the next victim like I am."
hey you scary me you talking about time share or talking about the place let me know thank you Francine
"The town of Playa del Coco should not be blamed for the bad timeshare sales reps. There are many wonderful restaurants and businesses that are honest and hard working. Any resort town has problems with timeshare sales reps, use common sense and avoid them. The old saying ""nothing in life is free:"" is good to remember. I enjoy visiting Playa del Coco and the surrounding towns of Ocotol and Hermosa. Go and enjoy a great vacation."
thank you for your answer over one year i prepare my trip and i hope i can enjoy that's true lots place i have rep with time share but not obligatory buy it if you have some place i can visiting during my time ther let me know thank you again
"This is a great area and lots to enjoy here... don't let anyone ruin your vacation ... easy to avoid the troublemakers! pura vida and enjoy,Randy Spate owner Dream On Sportfishing"
"thank you RANDY my trip is very close now and i want a good time with my friend i don ,t want no body ruin my trip any place he have trouble but keep out thank again"
"you can use US dollars most places in Coco, but will get change in colones. Exchange rate varies, download XE currency converter for most up to date information."
"The best way to find out the current exchange rate is to look here: http://www.bancobcr.com/ This is the ""bank rate"" and you don't have to paw through lists of countries and banks. And it's updated throughout the day, if you need that. (The exchange rate may vary from bank to bank but only by 1 or 2 colones which is WAY less than 1 cent.)While the exchange rate varies from day to day, only by a few colones. So I you check, you will see that it is now 532 and has been between 530 and 540 for a while. Unless you are buying some really big purchase, then 10 colones one way or another won't matter.Of course, if you use colones, you don't have to think about the exchange rate. That's the easiest and most reliable thing to do. (And kind of respectful, also.)"
merci peut tu me conseiller sur des choses a faire des endroits a visiter pas trop loin merci
"Bank of Costa Rica and Banco Nacional are the 2 busiest banks in Coco.. less crowed banks are Bank of San Jose in the Pacifico center https:/…index.htmland Banco Popular https://www.popularenlinea.fi.cr/bpop/ has the best exchange rate today at 532 ¢ per USDthis bank is in the same center as Banco Costa Rica but at the back of the complex across from Mega SuperYou'll need a passport for any transaction and be prepared to wait anywhere from 1 to 30 minutes depending on the time of day and staffing in each locationpura vida,Randy"
thank you very much Randy so appreciate my trip is caming soon can't wait
papillon607Don't forget about the ( person exit tax ) which is $29.00 us . I think you can pay at any bank. You can also pay at the airport but I hear the line there is very long wait sometimes.
"No, you can't pay at any bank. You can pay at the Banco La Fise or Bancredito and at some hotels. Sometimes the line is long at the airport.... sometimes not.When I am flying out, I usually get to the airport 3 hours ahead of my flight, pay my departure tax, check in and drop my bags. Then I go to a local restaurant for a meal, either eating it there or something to go, and then return to the airport for security and boarding my flight. The food at the airport is really bad and the prices are outrageous, even considering it's airport food. You can also get an idea of how crowded things will be by looking at flightstats.com to see how many other flights are leaving around the same time."
thank you very much for this info so appreciate is my first trip in Coata Rica and i want enjoy minute by minute 2 week now from my trip to playa del coco is you can suggest me some place to visit go and thank you again
"Yes not at any bank, also very very important don't forget to"
"No worries if you ""forget"" because you will need the departure tax receipt in order to check in for your flight and if you don't have it, they will turn you right around and send you over to the departure tax window to pay and get your receipt. You will also have to fill out a form so have your passport number and flight number handy."
wich you recommand to pay
"When you land at the airport, before leaving go to the Money Exchange window. NO LINE, or 2 people, and for $29 cash you can pay your departure tax in advance. Did that last month and saved a boatload of time."
"No -- it's not the money exchange window.To pay your departure tax upon arrival at LIR, you go through passport control, pick up your luggage and go through customs. Then, you will exit the customs area and be in the main part of the terminal where the airline check-in counters are located. Walk towards the check-in counters and you will see the departure tax windows near them, on your right.There is a Banco LaFise window where you can change currency at the prevailing rates, but they no longer accept payment for departure tax, I am told. Upon arrival, the departure tax window might be crowded.... it might not be. Just like when you are departing, the window might be crowded..... it might not be. It will depend entirely on how many flights are leaving around the time of your arrival or your departure."
Hattie GRACIAS…great advice…as always…roadadvisor
