(also reported on the local news) - Nevada leads the pack with a 44% reduction.https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cases-map-…
"I'd better start planning my trip! Should I stay at the Rio, or try something different??"
Wait? I thought you were headed to Arizona?
"Not completely sure yet....going to wait a little bit and see how it goes before committing. Just checking this morning, though, and the flights went down to $89 pp each way!Of course, the next logical trip would be Vegas!!!!"
I wonder if Nevada is doing better right now due to the 90 plus degree weather we have had for a few weeks. I really have no other clue why things would be improving here.
I moved my 5/22 scheduled trip to 6/5 this morning. I had been at Bellagio already booked. Hoping the timing syncs up.
"I'm really not interested in data on ""cases"" That's such a BS metric because it is heavily dependent on the number of tests, the validity of the tests and not in any way much of an indicator of the state of the disease.Let's see number of people admitted to the hospital, number in intensive care, and number that died. Those are the only real important metrics."
"Weather is one, aside from Vegas and Reno the fact that Nevada is so sparsely populated is another. CA and NY as an example have at least 25% of the population having antibodies, the virus was there for a while. Finally, I don't think Nevada was one of the states that ordered elderly virus patients who were discharged from the hospitals back into their retirement homes. In most states, nursing homes now account for most new cases."
"We had a spike in positive cases yesterday in our county, but that is more related to the fact that they are doing a lot more testing now. I just hope they factor in more things that just the number of positive cases!!Edited: 1:35 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"Depends on how much testing is being done. The more testing, the more COVID-19 positive people you will have.I prefer the infection rate as a measure i.e. what percentage of those tested are COVID-19 positive. It has been steadily declining in Nevada .from a high of 12.2% on April 25th, to 9.4% today (May 14th).With Las Vegas, there needs to be consideration of visitor infections. What is the COVID-19 situation in Los Angeles, Phoenix, etc.Wynn seem to be preparing for May 26th opening. It's probably wise to avoid Memorial Day weekend for opening."
"Testing is easy in Vegas right now, several locations. The Orleans Casino has a testing site than can handle 1,000 tests a day and you do not have to meet any criteria to be tested, just show up. They are not even seeing 1,000 people as not enough seem to want or need a test right now locally,"

"Good news. There are very few people and lots of empty space in Nevada. Flew over Nevada and driven in Nevada 100s times.Read in news Coronavirus has disappeared from Vietnam(0 death), HK and Taiwan no new case in a month. Heat helps if with good local management. Can be done, has been done. Hard part now is they can’t open border."
"@placebets (Post #11) - ""That is pretty meaningless data as well because as more are tested, that number is going to go down.""Not so, as I see it.If you test 1000 people, and 100 are COVID-19 positive, the infection rate is 10%. If you test twice as many (2000), the COVID-19 positive number will be 200 i.e. still 10%"
"“ Let's see number of people admitted to the hospital, number in intensive care, and number that died.”@PB- The numbers in these categories do not matter, the percentages do. Nevada will clearly have less than say New York in all of these categories because our population is so small. You have to look at percentages.@Rallen, The infection rate percentage you referenced is the metric our Governor has been using to make his reopening decisions."

"I've been checking the infection rate on the webpage, link below:https:/…The top-most chart on that webpage shows the infection rate.Further to my prior comment, there's a significant downturn around May 3rd, and the infection rate has been straight-lining downwards since then; if it continues like that, I can see Governor Sisolak starting Phase 2 around May 23rd, with the casinos getting the OK to re-open."
"Jupiter yes you are correct...my mistake. Still pretty meaningless data since we don't really care what % have caught it. We would be better off if everyone had caught it and survived. Those that have not caught it, just have not caught it yet....."
"I sort of agree with PB. The ideal scenario is the young and healthy get infected asap. The death rate for this group is miniscule. If the bulk of the population has had the virus you get to herd immunity. Aside from that, recovered people are able to donate plasma which combined with the virus having very few vectors would substantially protect the elderly and immunocompromised members of society. The economy would be allowed to function at or near 100% and life would be normal. Another big bonus to this would be that if you think sitting at home, isolating yourself from germs by whatever means is a good thing, I feel bad for you the moment you step outside in a few months. Your immune system will be shot. People that might have experienced no symptoms from 19 might die from the flu or get really sick from even the common cold. If we would have done this, a much smaller stimulus could have been used to pay any elderly American who isn't retired and who chooses to stay home, their salary for a few months. Same with people who have severe immunodeficiencies."
"More gaslighting. That was Monday (conveniently).I suppose you didn't have access to the LVRJ yesterday.Clark County COVID-19 cases surge for second day, topping 5K.The 176 new cases of the disease reported by the health district followed an increase of 107 cases reported Tuesday. That was more than double the daily increase of nearly 67 cases during the preceding week.The number of new hospitalizations in the county also has ticked higher in the past two days. The health district reported 24 new hospitalizations for the day preceding its report on Wednesday, and 26 the preceding day. Both figures were considerably higher than the average of just over 11 new hospitalizations for the preceding five days."
Wonder what the numbers are going to look like a month after the casinos open and everyone from around the country will start pouring in. Hopefully they stay low.
"@Post #19 - ""Clark County COVID-19 cases surge for second day, topping 5K.""The numbers just after the weekend, I find, are unreliable, and also the number of tests done has to be considered.Today (May 14th) - reported cases down to 99.A 7-day average is a useful measure to smooth out the weekday/weekend fluctuations."
"@Swearingen, As stated earlier our Governor is using the infection rate percentage metric. Raw numbers are not his consideration, if we test many more (and we are) cases may increase in raw number but the percentage could still drop."
"...Maybe they are digesting more disinfectant in Nevada.Edited: 3:17 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"The NY times has an interactive graph of daily new cases with the moving 7 day avg. The gating requirement before moving into Phase 1 is supposed to be 2 weeks of downward trend. You can see how few states have met that criterion. Nevada had that trajectory, but no longer.Certainly not Texas, AZ, GA, Fla, Wisc, all who seem to be bouncing along a plateau but are attempting to return to ""normal"".https:/…nevada-coronavirus-cases.htmlEdited: 3:25 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"""Wonder what the numbers are going to look like a month after the casinos open and everyone from around the country will start pouring in. ""Well, that's kind of the reason for a slow and measured reopening. To see what happens after you leave it up to thousands of half wits to follow the advice to social distance and the effectiveness of the changes made by the casinos.Personally I predict cases will skyrocket !Edited: 3:29 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"Life is full of risks, Coronavirus is one of those things for now. My house sits in a valley facing a wild forest as far as eyes can see with no house or man, populated with wildlife, including mountain lions, Rattlesnakes and giant eagles. Nearest mountain lion sighting is one block away. It is wild fire and earthquake country, the infamous San Andreas Fault line is one mile away, 2 miles of my daily commute is exactly along-on the San Andreas Fault line. My office is 5’ above sea level on the waterfront, 30 seconds walk to a beach and dock, full size giant Navy ships right outside my office windows, if fear mongers are right, it will be under water soon. All things considered, Coronavirus is just one of those things. We all have different ways to measure and judge risks, for us, risks are parts of daily living."
"New cases and percent positive have their uses but they aren't really a reliable metric to measure it in real time. Too many variables and of course there's a built in bias in who gets tested still. It's still being used to diagnose sick people or those exposed to them Which of course is understandable but it's not a good way to measure the population as a whole. Aggressive randomized resting of schools, workplaces, at the airport will do that.That said, the Governor doesn't have that data, so positive test % is the best we've got."
"Mac is the Austin Powers of the forum - ""I also like to live dangerously."""
"What is more dangerous? Coronavirus, San Andreas Fault, mountain lion or rattlesnake? I just spent couple hours in my garden which borders the forest with a million flowers, Coronavirus is the least of my worries. Mountain lion is the fastest way to go. My only concern is how does my family prove I have been eaten by lion to collect life insurance? At least a finger or foot must be found to make the claim, just a finger may not be good enough. BTW, there are 1,212 confirmed cases in my county. Very few or a lot? depending on who is judging."
"You could fare well against a mountain lion. They're not that big. Have some pepper spray in hand, too."

"Mountain lions are 'fraidy cats anyways. They're scared of human voices. Don't be afraid, Austin.Edited: 9:02 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"My wife is not too worried about finding remains to claim life insurance, she thinks I’ll be scared to death by the sight of the lion, and she doesn’t think the lion want to eat me, tough old meat. There were about 5-6 lion sightings within one mile radius in the last 12 months, not too bad, remain calm. Judging by CCTV footage, they are not small."
"I don't think 100-125 lbs is that big..but maybe. They're afraid of humans, though.Edited: 9:13 pm, May 14, 2020 "
Seems like you live in a very scenic area..nice.
"Can you imagine if the virus only infected mountain lions, but made them ravenous murderers impervious to bullets and jad attacked over a million and 82,000 had died? I think the SIP protestors might exercise a bit more caution before storming the state capitals. Lol"
"The real issue is that this isn't an equal opportunity disease. Even in New York State, it has hit three or four counties far worse than the up state area. Some places have nearly no cases, while other areas are hard hit.Even in areas that have been hit, nursing homes are being destroyed, while single family home neighborhoods aren't suffering from the disease.We need a smart, agile approach to the disease, not a one size fits all approach where areas with few cases are hurt by the lockdowns in a way that doesn't recognize the variation of the risk factors."
"Just saying, there maybe more present dangers in life than virus for some people. If one ran out of money with mouths to feed, rent to pay, that could be a far more serious immediate danger, or no choice but to work. Not to make light of the pandemic. 6th and Market is one spot I wouldn’t want to be seen, 6th street near Market is where all the drug addicts, dealers, prostitutes, pimps, homeless and mental cases hang out. Greyhound station is there, which is usually the most challenging area in cities. Guaranteed to find lots of Coronavirus there, wear a hazmat suit. There was a mountain lion sighting at San Bruno mountain yesterday, with picture. I live 10 minutes south of it."
I don’t see how the most restricted areas will not escape to an open state or city. New Jersey is opening it’s beaches and it’s going to be flooded with New Yorkers.
