What are people planning on doing leaving the island and returning to Massachusetts that can’t quarantine because of work? Are there options to get tested in Aruba prior to returning home? This almost seems so stressful and not worth it
"I would say if you absolutely can't quarantine when you get home, then it's a no-go for going to Aruba. I have a friend who is a nurse and just canceled her trip scheduled in January for that reason; her 2 daughters are nurses as well. Our family has been working from home and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. For us, it'll be ""fairly"" easy to do, but we'll do it because we have to. I have not seen anything that says you can be tested in Aruba before you return, but I believe if you call this number, they may be able to tell you: 1-800-862-7822 or email inbox@aruba.nanorep.inEdited: 1:07 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Getting tested in Aruba prior to return could be a double edge sword. Though the chances may be slim, what happens if you test positive? You may not be able to fly home."
I agree with everything JL said. It may be time to cancel for you.
"cancel .....it's too stressful and too complicated..you will not enjoy your tripEdited: 4:45 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Sorry to piggy-back on this, but does New York State have the same rule? It does make sense to self-quarantine when coming from overseas, but all I can find is the tri-state requirements for returning from the most affected states."
"We cancelled for November. It would be way too stressful. Hopefully, we will return in early April. Time will tell."

"This situation is changing daily....but I am about ready to pull the plug on my April trip as I don't see this sorting itself out for 1 year + according to some of what I have read/heard from experts. As it stands now there is NO way I could enjoy a trip to Aruba....we have not dined out or been in the general public since March 14 or so and I don't expect that to change anytime soon.I rather answer questions about the weather etc....than deal with Covid anymore but sadly its not going away anytime soon.Edited: 7:46 pm, July 31, 2020 "
agree with jay
didobas - there is no quarantine in NY when coming back from Aruba.
