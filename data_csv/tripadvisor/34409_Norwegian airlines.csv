Is Norwegian air financially sound now? I am looking to buy a rt ticket Bergen to Copenhagen.
We flew Noorwegen Airlines from Gdansk to Oslo a few months ago and had a most positive experience. Some of our family flew them at Christmas from New York to Paris and had the same good experience.Hope there are no problems. They did a nice job for all of us.
"They are sound for the time being, if your ticket is for this year, I would not worry."
"Thanks.Edited: 4:04 am, February 07, 2020 "
"No, they are better than they have been but still not good. If this is a trip next week I probably wouldn't worry about it, but if it's a trip in May, I'd choose SAS instead, even if they are a bit more expensive (although in my experience the difference in price is usually pretty small within Scandinavia when booking in advance).Edited: 5:42 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"No the price difference is quite a bit even though I am buying Economy plus for Norwegian and just an economy on SAS. I am traveling in July and I understand the uncertainty surrounding their future.Edited: 10:15 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"Don’t think there is much risk, but make sure your insurance/credit card covers."
"I'm finding out that many trip insurances do not cover in case of financial deficiency/bankrupcy of the operator, so indeed check carefully.But I would be OK to fly with Norwegian this year."
"In the end it's up to you how you judge the risk, but I would not buy a ticket with them for a summer trip. They might survive, but they might not. And that some insurance companies have said that they will not cover a Norwegian bankruptcy is a warning sign to me. It might look stable at the moment, but when things go bad they can go bad fast. When Thomas Cook went under it was just a couple of days from ""everything looks fine"" to bankruptcy."
"Let’s see, I have flights booked with Norwegian this summer. And I’m not worried at all..."
"I had flights booked with Air France late next month and I were not worried at all, not until I got a message that the flight were cancelled and our travel date brought one day back. So you are never 100% safe, but again it is not the end of the world..."
"Hi, I am also booked on Norwegian from the US and back, should I worry"
"Hi Queeni, I also live in Chattanooga and have used Norwegian for other skandinavian trips in past, also booked for this summer, should I be worried"
"No, I do not think you should be worried. They are not making any profit, but I do not think there is a real risk of bankruptcy for the time being. They are still awaiting compensation from Boeing."
"When we flew them, had no sign of any problems. Very pleased with the service and the flight was full.Enjoy your travels."
"Thanks, but I will call them, already paid for the Trip to Skandinavia and also Inland Norway"
"So, This is dilemma, just read that Norway is implementing a 10 day quarantine, until August 20th, I was not planning on staying that long inNorway, Flying in to Trondheim, then.Bergen and Oslo, NorwegianAirline has not cancelled the any of my flights, and , they don’t want give money back for the 3 flights I’ve booked , also all the Hotels, then Sweden, SAS has not notified me of anything, Hotels, etc, then off to Finland, same scenario, I am out of a very large amount of Money, AndI am very frustrated, any advice?"
"Currently, as far as I understand, and probably at least until Aug 20th, you are not allowed into Norway at all. Borders are closed to foreign nationals unless they have a compelling reason to enter Norway, and I don't think the US will be among the countries for which this may be relaxed sooner.https:/…When is your trip? Your flights may be cancelled later on. Companies try to hold on as long as they can.Edited: 12:35 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Flying in to Trondheim from Tampa, Fl to London, then to Trondheim on July 6- 7"
"Even if the flight is running I doubt they’d let you board as you would be denied entry to Norway.Airlines, hotels etc are cash strapped and it will be very difficult for any of them to refund. If you booked non-refundable rates then it was your risk. It certainly isn’t airlines or hotels fault that you can’t travel. If airlines cancel then you should be entitled to a refund, but if they haven’t got the cash then the best you can hope for is a voucher for flight at a later date. Hotels also might be generous and give vouchers - but for non-refundable bookings they have no obligations.What about US - when will that country be opening for tourism from Europe?Edited: 1:10 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Note US govt. global health advisory level 4 - do not travel!https:/…international-travel.htmlAnd UK and Norwegian citizens not permitted to travel to US - https:/…from-other-countries.htmlEdited: 1:20 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Well, I am still hoping it will be a go by July"
"Totally unrealistic expectation.Perhaps life is as normal in US, but it definitely isn’t in Europe.Edited: 2:27 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"You are all better off in Europe than here, in US, we have a Moran in charge"
