Is Tamarindo packed with Spring Breakers the whole month of March ?? Going for a month but now considering February instead???
Not really..some spring breakers...but not a lot of them..Roadadvsiro 100% costa rican indianTravel ProfeSional and a driver
I watched several videos and all said Do not cone during Spring Break. I’m concerned. Don’t mind crowds at all but kids is a different story. ??
"Not the whole month, mid to late March is extremely crowded with Spring Breakers but early March is okay. I have no idea why Roadadvisor would say there are not many! Sorry Luis, but I have to disagree with that!"
Thanks. That’s what I heard. I think mid February to mid March in Tamarindo and head to Lafortuna the rest of March ?
A>lly lam...love when you disagree with me...in that way Im sure you are reading some of my post !!Totally respect your opinion..even that I do not fully agree with!!Roadadvsiro 100% costa rican indianTravel ProfeSional and Pro driver
"If going in Feb., avoid President's week if possible. That week is very crowded too.Roadadvisor, 'Wink, Wink'! ; )"
"Costa Rica will finally come to its senses sometime this week and ban travel, so it won't matter. Costa Rica will face repercussions for decades to come for its non-response to a global epidemic, based on its sheer greed for tourist dollars."
"OMG...now someone ...is telling us how to decided our future ...Once again we trust our level of education, our health system and our government!!..Im glad Im a g""guide"" and I know my country...and I do not have to hide who I am ...I am in my wn country !!God help every body in this changing world...Roadadvsiro"
"Actually, I'm telling you that Costa Rica is deciding its own future and by not restricting travel (= greed), will become the only place people will want to go, and will risk a very severe epidemic. That will affect your country for a very long time. But you and I are both old and will probably be dead by then. I get that you don't want your tourism income to disappear but your income is not very important compared to world wide health. Every time someone provides facts, you dispute them with mere anecdotes. That affects your credibility ALMOST as much as the fact you respond to every post whether you have any actual input or not.Edited: 1:22 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Jackson, there are 195 countries. Only about 30 currently have some kind of travel ban. I'm sure that other countries are considering some kind of ban too, including Costa Rica, but it's not like their Government is not considering it so they are not behind the 8 ball anymore than most Countries.Edited: 2:06 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Jackson's words are harsh but this is time to have harsh words. For any country that is still in the bottom of the COVD-19 cases ladder, and is a recognised travel destination, it is of vital interest to minimise the possible importation of virus. As 75% of tourists are coming from USA, and they have their fair share of critical areas, it is only totally reasonable to prevent long term problems by stopping the travel for pleasure completely. Short term losses vs long term benefits.Allylam, indeed only a small portion of all world countries have implemented the restrictive measures. Unfortunately for them, many have done so too late. Like Slovenia. Every morning I woke up, there are more cases reported, and harsher measures implemented. All public transportation has stopped today. All non-essential public services are already closed, so is educational system. The total financial costs will be hard to calculate but for sure will be many times higher than the income lost from tourism. Which, btw is anyway effectively cancelled. Just food for thoughts."
"xeles, I totally agree with you 100%. My post was directed at Jackson as he appeared to be criticizing Costa Rica and Luis in general. We all need to pull together, not bash each other."
Can we just get back to the original question!
"Absolutely I was criticizing Costa Rica. IDK WTF Luis is. Road Advisor? Yes, criticizing him too, for continuing to tell people to come. I realize he makes his living off of tourists but this thing is bigger than that. And to get back to the original question, STAY HOME!"
"Yes, Sandy, I'm sorry I was distracted. At this time, I will stick to my original answers. Last two weeks of March will most likely be very busy with Spring Breakers, including kids, and Presidents week in Feb is also a bit busy, but if you can work around those dates you'll find less crowds, less kids, and beautiful weather!"
Thankyou. It makes me sad that people get angry when a simple question is asked. I’m going next year anyway. Thanks for the Nice replies ❤️
"Crazy times right now, but most of us do care to help when we can and try to stay positive. Next year should be great! Please come back if you have other questions and hopefully things will be more calm and back to normal. There is always hope! (That's my motto)"
Thankyou
