"The Puerto Rico Health Department has issued a a flu epidemic and warning after 11,000 cases of the flu virus, including 14 fatalities, have been registered around the island. Most of the flu cases have been centered in the San Juan area. Vacationers to San Juan may want to take precautions and acquire the flu vaccine before heading out to the island.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/pr-government-dâ€¦"
"Thank you for the heads up, PRexplorer!"
You're welcome. Are you heading to the island in the near future?
My mom is there now and we are going on the 31st. I just got mine but will have the wife get one as well.
"Thanks for the info. Any idea how long a flu epidemic typically lasts? We are coming down on Thanksgiving, though won't be spending any time in San Juan until mid-December. Wonder if we (myself, wife, three kids) should consider getting flu shots?"
"The fact that most of the flu cases are in the San Juan area indicates to me that it may have originated in the mainland or elsewhere as San Juan is an international city. For the most part there have not been a lot of flu epidemics in PR in the past. It's difficult to predict if the epidemic will worsen. I think it sounds worse than it is. Chances are you won't be infected, but one never knows.Edited: 6 years ago "
"The flu problem has been going on for about 2 months now. They now have started mass inoculations, so hopefully the spread will slow.It is the flu, not something to freak about. Wash your hands often and you should be fine. Flu season has started in the States too, we just got a jump start on cases."
"Unfortunately due to US Gov Shutdown its not that easy to see how the flu is doing in the other statesfrom the CDCOctober 8, 2013 -- Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are usually posted online weekly at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly. Due to the lapse in government funding, regular updates to the CDC Influenza web site, including the weekly FluView report and updates to guidance for clinicians, will not be possible. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/summary.htm"
"@snmhansom, you should consider getting the flu shot even if you don't visit PR. There are some virulent strains of influenza this year, so the flu shot is highly recommended. The strains that we get are similar to the ones in the mainland, since that is where people fly in and out the most. Usually here in PR influenza is not as prevalent as in the US, which is why with increased cases this year they are making extra efforts to vaccinate. A flu shot takes 2 weeks to confer immunity, so take that into account when planning your vaccinations."
"If you are concerned about acquiring the flu before or during your vacation, get the flu vaccine. It's not expensive and some employers offer it for free. It would be upsetting to get the flu on vacation and spend time at home afterward recovering."
