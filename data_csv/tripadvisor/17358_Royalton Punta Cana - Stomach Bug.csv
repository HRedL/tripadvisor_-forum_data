"Hi,Has anyone else recently stayed and got struck down with a dreaded stomach bug? We're here for 2 weeks and been poorly since day 4, currently on day 7.We've followed all the advice like no tap water etc. Any tips or advice?"
"Stay away from the fruit drinks, maybe stay with soda, etc. Easy on the sun and plenty of bottled water. Sorry, we didn't have any stomach issues 3 weeks ago. Good luck, keep us posted."
Yeaa. I have noticed an unusual number of reviews (even positive ones) commenting on stomach bugs at the Royalton.I sure hope this isn't the norm for guests. (And I definitely hope V_Thorne gets to enjoy the rest of their vacation!)
"ryguy2008, What reviews are you reading? I have just hit the last 20 reviews and not one word on stomach problems."
"very helpful rumor mongering, eltoro2010, i din't find that ""unusual number of reviews"" neither.btw, what would be a usual number of reviews mentioning stommach bugs?, lol.Mike"
"I looked, and saw a couple of reviews mentioning stomach bugs, but it's not like it's an epidemic or anything. Pretty much par for the course, I think.Mark"
Presidente poisoning?Mamajauna flu perhaps?
"kd,Mamajuana i would name the Cure, not the source, lol.enough Mamajuana and you kill any kinda bug/virus etc in your system, clean and pure alcohol only flooding thru the venes thenMIke"
Why not talk with some fellow guest and / or a member of staff or your tour rep
"Kdsmith - not the case at all, we're boring Brits.I think we've picked it up from the food, pool or just something going round."
"Flipflop_Man - we plan to speak to our rep but it's airport day, we'll catch her tomorrow"

"Sure you have heard of this ..eat when you have an upset tummyBRAT......Banana, Rice (plain white rice) And Toast (plain)DC"
"Flipflop, tour rep is a great idea, maybe if they knew more they could ask the right questions."
"many different possibilities for a bothered stomach as for where something went wrong. depends also on how it shows, like real pain and cramps or just a light run for bathroom sessions.for travelers it is not uncommon to start on the 2nd/3rd day for a couple days or maybe 3 days such light bathroom session times, that's the body's noral reaction on stress(even if you think to be relaxed, your body defr is under stress flying away, changing time zones, change of diet, change of eating/drinking behavior/with and without alcohol doesn't matter, we change what we usually drink on daily bases). i travel since i was a very young Man and stil, when doing the long haul over the big pond on the 2nd or 3rd day i pass one day of light upset stomach times, nothing big, its fine the next day again, but the body tells that something is out of it's used to routine. i have the same when flying from the DR to my Mothers Home as when i come back a month or two later from Germany to the to my own wife's homecocking. both are kittchens i am used to, but still, changing from one to the other is stressy for the body.now when such issues arise together wit cramps and real stomach pain or such, then we are talking something different and i would sure not wait several day without consulting a doctor for a quick check, specially in a tropical region with so many new dangers like cholera, dengue, chikungunya and an other dozen which's names i could not spell correctly.i hope v-thorne get's better soon and can enjoy a sunny remainder of vacationMIke"
"Sorry, didn't mean to spread rumours.I've been following the recent reviews and threads on this forum about the Royalton. Unlike other hotels that I've stayed at, the idea of upset stomaches / food poisoning has actually stood out as a common theme. It didn't detract from peoples vacations in every instance, but this was brought up fairly frequently.It's not necessarily indicative of it being a problem. It could just be a disproportionate number of negative Royalton forum threads recently that left me with this impression.Edited: 5 years ago "
"I must admit I was ill for about 3/4 days though I don't think it was a stomach bug it's just That the food is cooked heavily in oil, including basic food like pasta and rice which I personally am not used to and also think I overdone the fresh fruit/veg drinks, once I laid off those kind of foods I was fine. You just need to eat/drink sensibly and watch out for too much coconut!!"

"Thanks for all your replies and we'll wishes. We've avoided coconut and pineapple as we were told these can have a laxative effect. Since being ill, for breakfast I've been having toast & jam, lunch was either a dry roll and plain soda biscuits and I've skipped dinner. No change after a couple of days. We went to the shop today and was advised to take Andrews salts. Going to see the rep tomorrow and possibly the Dr as my husband is getting worse."
Home what ??
"Thats what I thought, lol"
"haha, just noticed... Dave should be so happy at home, may not wish to travel at all."
"of course the wife's homecooking will always be just the top rated 2nd best cooking of the globe, right after Mom's kittchen which stays always king of the Chefs.in fairness to all the all inclusive resorts we have to point out that a simple 5stars AI resort has per meal only a very small fraction of Wife's/Mom's budget for cooking available, so it is not a fair comparison.take $30.- - $35.- per 24hrs!!!, go shopping and then prepare for 1 person for 24hrs all kinda meals from breakfast via lunch via beachgrill station, a la carte dinner, late night snack bar, and of course during the same 24hrs serve unlimited drinks including Top Shelf Liqueur and the drinkets at the nightclub til the weehours. do not forget to stock the minibar and serve some snacks via roomservice for the in between small hunger. i bet Wifes and Moms would kick us out of the house if we would pressure them on such budgets but await the perfectly cooked to order steak and lobster, acompanied by a great wine.i never visited the Royalton, so i can't comment on their cooking tho.MikeEdited: 5 years ago "
"V_Thorne, not eating in that heat will make you feel worse. Try some cola for sugar and white rice at the very least. Plain pasta noodles are cooked in boiling water and fill his belly giving him energy. If taking bread, take from under the pile so not insects were sitting on it. Some brown beans or chick peas and some red beets will help with protein and blood cells. You will not feel any better by not eating, just the opposite... look for some wise choices and try small amounts of foods that may be preserved or canned. As mentioned, a banana wrapped and protected in its own peel is safe and good for you."
"Sorry Dave, still too funny to let go unnoticed after I saw it :)Edited: 5 years ago "

This thread took an interesting turn. ;-)To the OP: maybe look into getting some Ciprofloxacin. This is what our doctor always recommended when the basic over the counter medicines just didn't cut it.
It's much more of an interesting thread now...and yes Dave I did finally see where the original typo or declaration was posted :)Edited: 5 years ago 
"Myself and my family have just returned from Royalton Punta Cana this morning and for the last 5 days of our holiday myself and my 23 month old daughter have suffered from severe stomach bug, I have travelled to the DR several times and never experienced anything like this. Things are still the same today and u will be making an appointment with my doctor tomorrow. Hope you are feeling better soon."
"WOW, hope all feel better soon and, if it is not an inconvenience, share what caused such an illness.Hang in there V_Thorne and here is to the hope that you can enjoy the balance of your vacay.Sometimes resorts go through periods of assorted illnesses and, unfortunately, there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to the cause."
Or eat and drink too much...
Now I'm concerned…we leave for Memories on Friday. I don't care if the adults get sick but it would be very tough with a 23-month toddler who can't express herself very well yet. I guess I should stock up on meds…any suggestions for toddlers?
Pedialite in the powder form for rehydrating ( water and electrolytes) if they should get sick.

"dawn, why do you think the resort caused his illness?"
"Yup, Pedialyte in powder form is packed! Plus extra diapers and wipes."
"Ask the bartender for a shot, or more, of ""Fernet Branca."" I fixes things in about 20 minutes."
"Just been to the doctors and I've been prescribed antibiotics for bacterial infection in stomach, I had upset tummy from day 9 of 2 week holiday and arrived back home yesterday and the symptoms are still raging!!! I've been told by doc that I cannot go back to work as not fit as highly contiguous until 48 hours after it's stopped.Hope you are feeling better soon."
"What tests lead to the conclusion of ""highly contagious""... I can see them prescribing the antibiotics based on what you told him, where you were, etc... but to diagnose you with a specific condition that is contagious they would have more than what you tell them. What organism did they say you have?"
"BB did not say it was the resorts fault. I said that sometimes resorts do go through this sort of thing. Never implied it had anything to do with the resort but was curious about what the doctors say, that is, if the OP wishes to share."
contagious stomach bug... please explain... thanks.
Sorry to hear of your illness Lever but glad you got to the doc and got treatment. Hope you feel better really soon!
"It seems obvious to me that all Dawn was trying to say is that sometimes there's some kind of bug going around a resort. No fault of the resort - just circumstance. So you'll see a bunch of complaints for a week or two, and everybody gets nervous.Mark"
"Exactly what I had thought I said. Thanks for assuring me that i did not somehow misspeak. It is much like school. One kid gets a bug and the next thing ya know, half the school is sick. School is like a human petrie dish. The resorts are the same to a point as you have many people in one relatively small space and God knows who might have come to the resort sick to start with, or if someone at the resort did not practice proper hand sanitazion or food sanitation. I always say it takes just ONE person doing ONE thing wrong and BANG! Everyone gets sick. It happens in some of the finest establishments here in NY and everyplace elese, including people's homes."
"Kids don't have fully developed immune systems, and they interact with each other more. One kid has something, and the others have a good chance of getting it. Add in a buffet, and it's worse.My friends with small kids get sick frequently. My friends with grown up kids, or no kids, not nearly as much. Put a thousand or two people together, sharing amenities, and there's a risk. But of course, people blame the food.Mark"
Keep away from raw vegetables (specially lettuce) and tap water (if you are not used to it please used bottle water even to eash you teeth).
Something doesn't sound right here.
My thoughts too Kathryn
