"Hi there,II will be traveling to Belarus next month and will be there for 30 days, however, my question is if I can self-quarantine in a hotel or must I rent an apartment? I read some online comments that mentioned that self-quarantine in a hotel is not allowed. I booked a hotel and they didn't say anything about not being able to self-quarantine there, I also checked on official government websites and it says nothing about not being able to self-quarantine in a hotel.II don't want any surprises or problems when I arrive, so I just wanted to ask you guys out there, and see if I will be able to self quarantine in a hotel or will I have complications?Thanks!"
"Also, is having a Covid-19 test required in order to enter Belarus? I've been reading on some places that it's mandatory in order to enter Belarus, but don't know how true that is.... In Canada we can only get a Covid-19 test if we have symptoms, were exposed to someone infected, or some special circumstance... they won't give me one just because I want to travel."
Any address is ok. Feel free to follow my YouTube channel on any covid updates from our Health Ministry and (tips from me).A
