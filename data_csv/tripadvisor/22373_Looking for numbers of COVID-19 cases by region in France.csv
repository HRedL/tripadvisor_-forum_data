"Couple of issues here. Did you apply for a renewal of your visa, or because you couldn’t get an appointment,or ignore the whole issue for the reasons stated. If you have made no attempt to legalise your status, you may be here unlawfully. Go to your Prefecture immediately, keep a record of time of visit, and the outcome."
