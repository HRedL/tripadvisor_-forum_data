"I have seen news headlines today saying that the infection rate in Germany has risen in the last two days. But if you read some articles in depth they state that the same researchers who are actually studying it are not sure that it is actually rising! Plus Germany only eased the restriction days ago. The media shouldn't make it out that it's a fact in a headline when it's ""maybe"". They should not be scaring the public.So the moral of the posting is to do your own research, think for yourself, don't believe everything you read, even from the most ""authoritative"" sources."

Just looked at the statistics...https:/…coronavirus-karte-101.htmlNew infections are down for the last few days. doubling time continues to slow. So where did the OP get their information from?
https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-cor…Unless you are inclined to disbelieve a reputable agency like Reuters or German Govt's own Robert Koch Institute.
Of course infection rates are rising after lots of shops have opened. Why doubt statistical facts?

"""Of course infection rates are rising after lots of shops have opened. Why doubt statistical facts?""You didn't understand my post. I said the media headlines said the rates are up. But the fact is, if you read some articles, the infections MAY be up. They are keeping a close look. All I was saying is the media, some media at least, is scaring the public. As far as any correlation between shops opening and the rate (maybe) going up is also misleading, if not false. This is because the incubation period is like 2 to 14 days. Stores opened up late last week so there is little to no chance there is any correlation. The media wants you to read their articles (and click on the links) but if they write headlines like ""Infections may be rising"" and ""Probably no correlation with shops opening"" then not as many people will read and click. Still they should not be doing that at a very bad time like this. Trust is vital now."
"Perhaps a bit of exaggeration is good at the moment, I see too many out and about in groups like in normal times. The group protesting in Stuttgart at the other day are just a danger, 1000 people huddled together most no masks.We all want our lives back but forcing it now will just bring the lockdown back as cases rise again"
"The Reuters article linked to earlier mentioned that the most recent reported increase was largely due to a single cluster at one meat processing plant. Clusters like this will, obviously, always show in the statistics but don't really tell us anything about overall trends."
"indeed, the low numbers now mean that any localised outbreak in a meat plant etc. skews the overall numbers massively. The Robert Koch Institute is even dealing with unexpected late registrations from weeks ago for some districts. All in all, the day to day numbers can fluctuate so you need to keep an eye on the weekly average which some reporting services are now calculating"
"IMHO the best practice would be updates with the posting of daily new cases. In someways it is kind of like which came first, the chicken or the egg? When is a case a case and when is it to be reported has become a hot potato around the world. Read 15 periodicals and get possibly 15 different views. The original poster has had posts taken off due to false narratives. Still waiting for the miraculous vanishing of the virus in about a week in NYC as the OP predicted. Be well, be safe, think."
"""Still waiting for the miraculous vanishing of the virus in about a week in NYC as the OP predicted.""Today all media in the US is reporting a significant decline in most states. New, daily hospitalizations in NYC are down by 90% since the peak weeks ago (about 1500+ daily cases versus about 150 now). At this point the media has to be fairly honest. Also today Germany is now pushing to open all internal borders by June 15. I believe US travel will follow soon after, assuming the virus is at or below a certain level.Your idea of best practices is incorrect. The only thing that really matters is new hospitalizations. New cases are dependent on testing capability (assuming the tests are accurate, too); the more you test the more cases you get if the virus is still circulating. New hospitalizations tells the most accurate picture of the situation. The picture is clear: the virus is going away fast. Will it come back in the fall? Don't listen to anyone who compares it ton the flu.Edited: 3:43 am, May 15, 2020 "
"New user name, same poster, same nonsense."
"@BlandineForberg, you are correct. Thank you for helping those of us who love travel. Be well, ignore the troll with a T. ;>) and those with similar agendas."
