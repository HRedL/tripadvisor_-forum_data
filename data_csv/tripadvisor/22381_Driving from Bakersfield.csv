"Hello,We are visiting for the first time during the labor day weekend. We plan on driving and stoping for the night in Bakersfield on Wed 9/2. We are staying in Vasilia Thurs-Sun Morning. Any suggestions on places to vist our first day? We are happy to explore along the way, enter the park then check in to our Air Bnb. Friday we will enter the park super early to beat the crowds. How bad will the crowds be?Thanks!"
Visalia is just another hour or so. I can only imagine what Bakersfield looks like during the pandemic. The hotels? Not me. Pre SARS-CoV-2 the Marriott or DoubleTree was barely passable. Our Farmers are having Covid-19 outbreaks. You're heading straight to it . Good luck.
Here is a COVID dashboard by county. You might want to check it before beginning your travels.https:/…
"So your first day in the parks is Thursday? Coming from Bakersfield? This will be your least busy day at the parks. So you might want to visit one of the more popular places, like General Sherman and Congress Trail.For Friday, get an early start and visit Moro Rock, Tunnel Tree and Crescent Meadow. These are on a narrow road with limited parking, get there early. Saturday- maybe visit Kings CanyonHere is a good resource for hikes-www.redwoodhikes.com/SequoiaNP/SEKI.htmlAnother thread about Labor Day Weekend.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14305…"
"Labor Day weekend is one of the busiest times of the year at Sequoia.This summer the entrance gate traffic lines have been extremely long on all weekend mornings. I have seen media reports of traffic jams of 2 miles and waits of up to 90 minutes on Saturdays, 60 minutes on Sundays just to get inside the park. That has been every weekend this summer. Labor Day weekend will be worse.Whatever you consider ""super early"" I would make super, super early. I would plan to arrive at the Sequoia entrance no later than 9am, as much earlier than that as possible is definitely better. (Visalia to the entrance gate on highway 198 is a 45 to 60 minute drive)Also, be respectful. Locals are reporting tourists are throwing trash out of car windows and making road side bathroom breaks while stuck in the traffic jams at the entrance gates.There are no in-park shuttles this summer, they usually operate until after Labor Day. Normally that helps with traffic and parking congestion at the major sites. This year I would expect parking to be even more congested on Labor Day weekend without the shuttles operating.North of Bakersfield you will see a freeway sign saying use Highway 65 through Porterville to reach Sequoia National Park. I would skip that exit, it is mainly a 2 lane rural highway with some slow farm/semitruck traffic and many crossroads. Instead stay on 99 to 198 to Visalia, that is freeway for most of its length until you are 20 miles from Three Rivers.Regarding the virus, I would monitor local conditions and assess your own risk as the travel comes closer in a few weeks. Things are constantly changing. As of yesterday, most of the Bakersfield hospitals are at or above their licensed ICU capacity and the state has sent additional medical teams to help. Kern County (Bakersfield) and Tulare County (Visalia/Tulare/Porterville/Three Rivers) are both currently seeing high per capita case numbers and high test positivity rates. That situation may be better or worse in a few weeks.Edited: 1:34 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"Busy! Busy!I highly recommend getting up there, Parking and using your feet to explore. (You'll likely not find parking mid-day). Choose where you want to explore and park early!!Edited: 1:50 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"""I highly recommend getting up there""Surely something is missing from this statement."
"If you look at the Covid map of CA (available at the LA Times outside their paywall) the Central Valley is a big hotspot. Even mentioned by Dr. Birx specifically. AND California has a hitch in its kiddy-up with regards to its reporting system and it’s believed the numbers since mid-to-late July are well under reported. The LA Times also has an article about that although behind their paywall. I’m getting slammed on this forum for my “anti-travel” views. So be it. People traveling here from hotspot areas could easily be stirring their germs into our pot. In this case, I fear you’ll be taking home a souvenir you weren’t bargaining for."
Thank you for the proofread.I highly recommend getting up there EARLY! I would try to be up at the Giant Forest by 8 or 9 am.

Here is the LA Times Coronavirus tracking page: https:/…It’s really helpful. Especially for travel. It breaks down where in each county the outbreaks are at there worst so you can avoid those areas.
Thank you Lemon Curls. I plan on being at the gate when it opens. Prepurchasing our park pass is also part of the plan.
"Thank you everyone for the great advice. We are leaving earlier and will add 1 more day at the AIR bnb- no stop in Bakersfield:) We understand our risk and will closely watch what happens with COVID in this area. This will be our first trip during a major holiday, we normally travel off season to avoid the crowds. Any specific araes that may be less crowded on Saturday? We are open to driving and checking out areas known to locals. Thanks Again."
"The entrance station doesn't close, it isn't staffed at night and the early morning hours. So you can enter as early as you'd like. Start early. Find parking. Explore that area. Many Parking Lots will fill by midmorning.Saturday- I would do a long day hike, bring lunch, snacks and water."
