"To buy a timeshare? I know it isn't usually a good time to buy a timeshare, but I'm looking for somewhere to stay on the West Side and all the hotels are closed, but I hear the timeshares have remained open. Any recs on where I should buy?"
I recommend that you support those timeshare sales sharks and help Maui's economy by calling and paying full price.
"You don't want to buy into the ""new"" Maui Lu.......oops, Hilton Grand Vacation club thing? Since they have Kihei Road closed there for a few months more, you could just camp out I bet.If you insist on hot water and walls, plus beds.....maybe see if Activities (4) less is ready to give you a GREAT deal?Or just buy a condo and then you can become a landlord too :-)."
"SunnyForgot Timeshare, Camp Olowalu is your best bet"
"Bury your money in the sand, it’s a better “investment.”"
Sunny use some of money and buy you a new jeep. Save the rest; because the girls are gonna need it for college (and marriages). LOL!
New Jeeps have too many doors and no souls. My children have free university courtesy of the Crown...or whatever replaced the Crown down under. Or at least they did before sars-cov2 blew a hole in the budget. But they’ve got a few years for things to improve and they’re not getting married until I’m dead. So a timeshare it is.
"Sunny are you SURE when one or the other one turns 18, they won't elope to Vegas to get married.I'd go for the timeshare NOW! Who knows what will happen next? The next plague, tsunami, or POTUS? LOL!"
"As a former timeshare owner, let me say that it is NEVER a good time to buy a timeshare. I realize some people own them and love them but that was not my experience. Timeshares are not a good deal, ever. Our experience has been that we can do way better on our own without having to be tied to annual maintenance fees and fees to be part of a club that allows us to use different properties.Be aware too that timeshare properties sometimes require large repairs and renovations that are not covered by your regular maintenance fees. I know some timeshare owners who’ve gotten renovation bills in the mail for $10,000+ that they had no idea were coming and they then have 3 months to pay. We owned our timeshare for about 5 years and during that time our maintenance fees more than doubled. They are also next to impossible to sell (despite what the salesman will tell you) and for most people are just a horrible deal all around. I would suggest you only buy one if you really like that certain specific property and want to come back to it and only it year after year at the same time of year and don’t mind getting hit with large unexpected fees. The whole thing will end up costing you way more than if you just stayed out of the timeshare world and searched for a place to stay during the time you have available."
