Does anyone know what happened with the Air Canada flight that arrived yesterday? AC980? Did all passenger have to quarantine? Or is that just flights from Miami?Thanks!
"The rule up to July 31 was that all passengers arriving from Canada had to have a COVID test on arrival and then stay in an approved quarantine hotel for 24 hours awaiting the test results for all passengers on the flight.I can only assume that is what happened. What is more interesting is whether the rules will change as of today based on the data collected from the month of July, as was suggested by the Ministry."
"From IWNNEMO said that all 104 Air Canada 980 passengers who arrived from Toronto on Thursday, July 30, have been released from mandatory quarantine, having all arrived with negative PCR tests or being found to be negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus on entry screening."
"Hi, Does anyone know if I have to ve on quarantine the 24hours even if I have a flight the same day I arrive Grenada? I arrive SVG from Miami, and 5 hours later I have a flight to Grenada. I'm not planning leave the airport. I didn't see something related on the web documentation on Ministry of Health."
"The new protocol posted on August 2nd suggests that in-transit passengers must (1) have a negative COVID test taken within 5 days of arrival and (2) must not leave the airport while waiting for their onward flight.However, Grenada appears to have a mandatory 14 quarantine in an approved quarantine facility, at the traveller's expense for anyone arriving from the United States.https:/â€¦"
