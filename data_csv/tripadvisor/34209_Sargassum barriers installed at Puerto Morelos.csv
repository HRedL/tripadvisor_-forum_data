"1,200 linear meters of sargassum barriers installed at Puerto MorelosBy Riviera Maya News on May 26, 2020Puerto Morelos, Q.R. — Puerto Morelos mayor says 1,200 linear meters of marine barrier has been installed to tackle the arriving sargassum.Municipal head Laura Fernández Piña says the barriers have been installed in front of the public beaches. “In recent weeks, we have carried out maintenance of the marine bands, which will help us to raise the macroalgae directly from the seashore to the collection trucks, that is, we will add one more mechanism to avoid a greater landfall on our beaches,” she explained.She notes that the municipality has worked continuously, even during the non-sargassum months, to ensure pristine beaches. “When tourism is reactivated, our main asset, which are our beaches, will be in impeccable condition,” she added.The mayor reported that currently, city council workers work every day in cleaning tasks with sweepers and tools to remove any seaweed that has been making it to shore.Luis Cardeña Peña, municipal director of Special Projects announced that only last week, around 142 tons of sargassum was removed from the beaches by city council staff.“With the machinery we use, which allows us to return the sand to the beaches and does the work of 40 people in one day, we are moving forward with the removal of sargassum. We will continue to work in a coordinated manner,” he said.Fernández Piña says workers will continue to work “with strict preventive measures such as social isolation and decreased mobility, which has shown good results thanks to the participation of citizens, which today, means they have a municipality free of active SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases.”"
This is interesting. I am curious regarding what they look like and how they work. I think that Puerto Aventuras was considering some time of barrier as well.
"It's a floating barrier which is anchored to the sea floor. An image is in the media report...https:/…2020.htmlSargassum collects along the barrier and is picked up by a vessel specially designed for that task.Last year, barriers were used at a couple of locations at Playa del Carmen (and other locations; maybe PM). They weren't 100% effective, but the amount of sargassum on the beach was less than what I observed at beaches where there were no barriers.Edited: 11:29 am, May 26, 2020 "
"Puerto Morelos has always seemed to have a bit more seaweed than other beaches in the Riviera Maya, long before the last couple of sargassum invasions. I would rather see them spend the money on planting a few more trees on the beach."
"We were last there in October. The barriers were there, were they taken down?"
"Yes, the barriers at PM were removed, but I don't know exactly when (they were installed in June 2019).At Playa del Carmen, the barriers were removed during October 2019.Typically, there's not as much sargassum from October to February."
Here's a report from RMN with images of the barrier...https:/…2020.html
