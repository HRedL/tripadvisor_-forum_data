"Hi, my girlfriend and i got a Flight to Madeira tomorrow morning. Is it still possible to arrive at the Airport and enter the Island? I just read an Articel about them closing the harbour. We are from Germany.Thanks! Best regards Felix"
Turn up at your local airport tomorrow morning & you will find out
Your airline will advise if your flight is affected. At present it is only cruise ships that are not to be allowed into harbour in Funchal.
"Yes, it is possible. Screening will be performed to arriving passengers at Madeira airport but I think that will only be made from Sunday or Monday. Expect delays because screening is carried out individually. If you have Covid-19 type symptoms or have been with infected people, please don't come."
"#1 people come to the forum for help and advise, the current viras situation is leaving people rightfully worried, your post is neither helpful or necessary."
"There is no coronavirus ""test"" on arrival but temperatures will be taken.Also, it's not just cruise ships that are banned from docking at any port in Madeira but also yachts.Edited: 8:03 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Hi Felix,This information came out this evening: https://www.madeiraislandnews.com/2020/03/fi…Germany is one of the countries stated, but there is another post above it which says: “the cessation should take place within seven days until further evaluation”. I have also read that the Madeiran government has to get the agreement of the Portuguese mainland government to do this. So it is possible that your flight tomorrow morning will be one of the last from Germany to be allowed to land (for a while). Whatever happens, I hope everything works out for you."
