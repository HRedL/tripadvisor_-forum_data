Hi all and I hope you are safe and well. Just a quick question to see what the situation is like in Malta. Is everyone on lockdown like here in the UK?We are due to attend a wedding this June on Malta. It looks unlikely that the airlines will be flying again by June but if they do what is the situation currently in Malta?Do new arrivals get quarantined?I know it’s uncertain times but was just wondering the situation on the island. Thanks in advance and again stay safe.
Look up Skyline Webcams Malta they are live webcams so you will see for yourself.Yes you have to go into Quarantine 14 days that started nearly 2 weeks ago.Everywhere in Europe is at least 2 weeks ahead of Britain because Boris listened to Bankers and not doctors.
"Coincidentally Times of Malta just put out this article which is in line with what you're wonderinghttps://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/ryana…But in all reality I feel like it's a stretch to say that the situation in June will be fine. I know many weddings which got postponed this year. We've been on partial lockdown for a while now, and it just got more intense as non essential stores were ordered to shut down this week too. All those who can are working from home. It's all very quiet.Edited: 11:07 am, March 24, 2020 "
Thanks for the reply
"The world and population simply cannot afford to put the ‘Closed’ sign up until June. My opinion is there’ll be movement by then, but perhaps the wedding will have had to be cancelled prior to that, anyway."
It is not a matter anymore if we can afford it but can we afford to open and then have a relapse or another outbreak.It takes about 4 weeks coming it lives with us for 4 weeks and then takes 4 weeks gong so three more months and that is June.
"I agree with Mr Phuket in the last 2 weeks the UK has made 500,000 new claims to universal credit due to severe hardship. That is more than the recorded infected cases . Plus there doesn't appear to be an exit plan. My bet? Mid April the shackles will be removed in business."
"Love him or loathe him, Trump will be proven correct: ""The cost of the cure cannot be more than the cost of the problem"". There will come a time when hard choices, VERY hard choices, will be made to get the world going again."
Does that mean we let Mr.Trump choose who lives and dies after all China are saying he put the virus there in the first place.
"Been saying that since day 1 of the panic in the cure is worse than the disease sometimes . The media have flogged this to death and I, for one am very angry with our BBC ""flagship national broadcaster"" having ok coverage on BBC news 24 BUT on its main entertainment channel too! Cheap Tele! With us all sitting in going bloody mad BBC trawl the world with more doom and gloom figures and stories to cheer us up. Some horrible figures coming from Spain but just what was their pre CV death amounts for the same period say last year? About the same? Slightly less? Thing about stats is they can be twisted anyway the author wishes.Edited: 11:49 am, March 25, 2020 "
I get all the English channels nw I have a tv with about 700 channels 650 of them either duplicate or just rubbish.The worse programme is BBC Breakfast TV aright load of pompous gits on that no wonder I went out and bought a dvd player.
"Mr Trump won't choose who lives or dies, doctors will do that. In fact, they make that choice every day but it never hits the news.You have to look beyond the headlines and virus: can the world and population afford to continue closure, with no manufacturing, no services, no wages / salaries , no 'business' for as long as it takes the virus to work its way through... or until a vaccine is identified?The answer is absolutely 'No'. A point will come when people, companies, business, governments will be on the verge of breaking. That point will depend upon how far forward those coming out of the virus situation are. Do you think 'the west' will stand idly by and let the Chinese and other Asians get a business foothold, while the west remains in lockdown?This is when the hard choices will be made. Basically, a weighed-up choice between continuing with a lockdown, or allowing a 'restart' and just accepting the hit of an ongoing virus.Anyway, this is a travel forum, not a political one, so I won't say more here."
"Couldn't agree more Mr P and these are free forums , nobody's travelling and I for one love to read your posts they make sense. This in the end is a war, and like any war there are casualties sadly. This war is obviously not man made (I don't think) so the objective of going to war , and winning is so it secures a better life for the *good guys"". Colateral damage sadly is a side effect, ""fortunately "" this virus is particularly lethal to the very old or already sick. Let's never forget it's fatality rate is <1% of those that contract it. Keep posting the more comments the merrier."
"Thanks - when you think, and take a long view, the next stage is really quite obvious. But, as yet, we don;t know when that'll start.Might post more as it all unfolds. :-)"
"This is the site I keep in tune with:https:/…On the face of it, the figures are huge, but take a step back. In the whole WORLD, we have less cases than there are people who live in Leicester. And, for deaths in the WORLD, it equates to the small market town of Ripley in Derbyshire."
Lives are more important than money.
Who suggested otherwise ? Graham
"Indeed they are up to a point. I personally think that we are very fast approaching the stage where the economy, and the wrecking thereof will be far more of a priority than the virus. The ""cure"" is very much worse than the disease as we stand today. The subject of ""exit plan"" is often swerved in the daily briefing. The answer is very simple. If we are to all have a life, and by that I mean freedoms to move, work and socialise , then there will have to be some stark decisions to be made. A study in France states that economic growth shrinks by around 2% every fortnight of lockdown. You do the Math but shall we say , 6 months as that Dr on BBC let slip the other day? A negative growth of 52%? Doesn't even bare thinking about. So yes lives are important of course they are, but so too is the quality of life for the vast vast majority that are left behind. I mean if you have an ingrowing toenail , it's not a great idea, to amputate the whole leg, is it?"
Some great points on here.Just like to add how much Ive noticed how much more pleasant the environment is already in the short time the polluters have largely ceased. As a supposed 'key worker' I travel to and from work every day and the difference is palpable.Do agree with our friend in Thailand. The west won't allow itself to be knocked off it's position on pole.
On the plus side less people killed on the roads in the past 50 years.
"It's a very bitter sweet kind of peacefulness where I live. I'm on the flight path for Luton airport (about 12 miles away) and bar 3-4 Whizz Air and the daily DHL freight airbus there is nothing. To be honest I would love to have the inconvenience back if an Easy Jet or Ryanair every 4 minutes again! As for the roads Mr Mick yes maybe quieter but I find those that are driving and it is in the increase (but folk have to do something to prevent cabin fever!) but those that are driving are racing each other! Personally I think we will start seeing movement here in UK next week, post ""Easter"". Don't think here, or definitely Malta and the like, will go into summer with the status quo as is. Tourism industry is number one in Malta plus I seriously don't think people will stay at home , into the summer. Not fair I mean many many apartments in Malta have zero air con. What about the health concerns there?"

"Keeping this thread updated, re the situation in Malta.Covid19 caseshttps:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
Cheers Eileen. The wedding we’re attending has now been rescheduled for June 2021. Stay safe everyone
is it sill in lockdown 27/4/2020
Yes - Malta is still in lockdown.
"There are no changes to the current instructions yet.New infections have been low for a few days now, and the government has said it will look at the current restrictions in a week or so, if the good trend continues.Suggest you look at the Times of Malta website each day to keep updated."
"Tony no flights are allowed to leave Malta or land, except reparation flights which were being run by air Malta to London Heathrow, think even those have more or less stopped now tho, the country is in lockdown."
Malta starting to ease lockdown from Monday with a wide range of businesses allowed to reopen with strict social distancing in place.
"I've been trying to think of an analogy for what the law makers want as to regards to social distancing and what the actual reality will be over the next month or so. The only one I can think of would be where I used to work, the dress code. When it first came in, was shirts and ties and shoes and trousers.Then ties became absent. Shirts became tshirts. Shoes became black trainers. When I left it was about as far from the original dress code as it ever was when there wasn't one. The point I am making is that draconian rules seldom last long. The phrase you can't change the habits of a lifetime are oh so true.In Malta try the smoking ban? Kind of enforced isn't it, but look on Gozo!Can you all honesty see any form of social distancing existing in say a month after we are pet loose?No neither can I."
No mention of bars or restaurants allowed to open yet.
"Think there was in the week Juney with the emphasis on al fresco only. Be hard to to that eh? Make people sit outside to have a pint in Malta in summer eh? 2 meters too is a doddle as any less than that like 1 metre is well into your space...So ""hang on sloopy sloopy hang on"" let's open the doors and get the cider flowing eh Juney??"
Fingers crossed Stath as due to go early July. That's assuming planes are flying lol.
"Nothing confirmed yet, but this week many non essential shops were allowed to open again. If all goes well further measures may be lifted by the end of May."
"Lesson to be learnt for UK - that's if they bother to look at what happens elsewhere, of course.The 'casual lock' has been loosened and, whe-hay, the genie has come fully out. Many people around, and plenty of car congestion. Controls are in place for going in to shops, but other than that, it's a free-for-all.We'll see what happens if bars and restaurants are allowed to open next.Will be interesting to see what happens to Malta's testing and infection figures 14 days from now"
We have a year round apt in Gozo and were last there in Feb...supposed to be back there now but waiting for flights to be reinstated and then we will be off...retiring in Sept there. We have an apt in a small complex (80 residents) with beautiful grounds and acres of land...however we are told that the pool or the surrounding terraces cannot be used at present...would love to fight that decision with social distancing etc you would wonder.....
need to get there sooner as a boat we ordered is being delivered.....we figure if we can get a flight out we may not come back again for months!!!..Gozo is just fabulous....much nicer than Malta espec if you like peace and quiet which we do and the diving is better too :-)
My hubby dives with St Andrews and nothing beats sitting in xlendi out of season in the sunshine...love Country Terrace restaurant and Qbajjar also....very tough on all of them at the present time...just hope it doesn't change to much too quickly like Malta has!
Phuket 14 to 21 days I say.
Skarke hopefully you'll get to your retirement home on gozo soon.
"PhuketBigdaddy, that is what many in Malta are wondering. As soon as the numbers started dropping, people resumed to their normal lives. And anyone familiar with Malta knows that locals are lax over rules. Although the authorities are trying their best to maintain them, many people just won't follow them or simply forget to."
"Mt you can't just forget to follow rules, it's more like they don't want too, a lot of people are head stuck in sand syndrome and think it won't happen to them, until it does, after all anyone can contract this virus it's not fussy who it infects."
"The Maltese blaze their own trail that's why. They are not like what we have turned into,a nation of snow flakes that literally believe and obey anything someone wearing a suit says.On this day of all days, VE day we should look at the shambolic country the UK has become and be a bit ashamed. It's a mess. Nobody has anyback bone anymore ,rather like a leaf in a river going along with anything that's said. Pitiful.I love the Maltese and their ways. I love the way taxi drivers go about,phone in one hand,lump of pizza in the other I like the old fellas that sit in cafés chatting and laughing.Builders having a quick can if Cisk before work.UK has become nothing more than a toxic workhouse populated by the entitled to generation.Always be an England Vera Lynn sang? Well unless we grow a pair,stop following the herd,not sure for how long.Happy VE day folks...and thanks Malta we couldn't have done it without you."
"Honestly Eileen, I myself sometimes forget that we're in this situation, and I've spoken to many honest people who have said the same thing. I guess it's easy to get used to changes like working from home so you forget why it's being done. But of course you will always find those that just won't follow orders.If it is mandatory to keep some distance from another person and you think that rule's bull, that's fine. But don't be selfish and break the rule around others just because you don't believe in it because maybe the other people do. Some people truly have no sense of respect."
We catch ordinary sore throats or colds by contact with others. This can be by droplet infection or touching surfaces contaminated by the virus.How much more important it is to distance ourselves from others as this can be passed on by someone NOT displaying symptoms .To distance from others is to show respect to them irrespective of your opinions.
"Mt there's such a thing as personal space, which if people adapted to respect people's personal space then they'd also be abiding by the social distancing of 2m,it really gets me when I'm in a supermarket and someone leans across me, if they'd said excuse me I'd of moved for them, now covid19 has nothing to do with that, I hated it before all this, it's simple manners."
"Stath in a way I agree with you, but this virus is a killer, anyone can get it, it's not fussy who it infects, yes at first it was mainly the old, but it isn't now, if staying in for 2 to 3 months keeps me, my family safe then I will do that, remember crohns does compromise my immune system, now I'm not at deaths door, I live a full normal life work 40 to 50 hours a week still as you know, and I'm otherwise healthy, but with what it can do to immune system I'd rather not push my luck.You have said in the past about the old and those with pre existing conditions would be dead within a year or 2 well no not all, I certainly wouldn't be there's no reason why I couldn't live until I'm 100 (I'm an optimistic) but you get what I'm saying, unless I'm run over by a bus of course, so I'd rather stay healthy and alive, and so would the majority, its the minority who seem to think we should all go out and risk getting infected, with an outcome of we don't know, as it seems to affect different people in different ways, I intend to be around for a long time yet, I've beaten death once as you know so intend to live,so I get too do what I want in my retirement, see grandkids if my two actually have any, way there going probably not. Lol.So sorry I'll be staying in, only going out when necessary until I'm told I can go out and about my business as normal, if my work reopens before then, then yes I'll go to work, but straight home afterwards."
"tattyff I agree with you, a friend of mine her 6 year old daughter had leukaemia this was 8 years ago, if something like this had happened then and she'd of caught it then she wouldn't be a healthy 14 year old now, my friend at the time, wasn't allowed in her room without ppe on when she was having her treatment because even a common cold could of killed her."
Nicely said tattyff. Like Eileen I have Crohns and I can guarantee that having your immune system going into overdrive is something you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. Let's hope we can all respect personal space a bit more.
"tatty and Eileen, those were precisely my points. Twice I've recently been at the shops and had somebody come within such proximity to me that I'd barely need to extend my arms to touch them. And this is with all the TV adverts reminding us to keep distances! I don't care if you think that this virus is a gimmick and nothing more than a cold, you should still respect boundaries as you don't know if the person next to you is going through any health issues. And even if they're not, who are you to just disrespect boundaries? Common decency is not common at all."
"Mt-avidtraveller it's the same in the UK only the other day several people reached across me to get stuff while I was shopping, wouldn't care it wasn't as if I was stood there taking my time I walked up grabbed the thing I wanted, was about to move, they put there trolley at side of mine so I couldn't move out of the way reached right across me 4 times out of that 7 it was the same person, on the 4th time said something, I said you know I was about to move out of your way, sure some respect, just looked at me as if I had 2 heads, so pushed his trolley out the way and walked off saying to him nothing like manners is there, same bloke on check out next to mine didn't wait until last customer was actually at other side of till packing, he walked right up behind them, started putting his stuff on the conveyor the cashier told him to put his stuff back in trolley and go wait back behind the line, he said no thanks some of us are in a rush, she said look sir leave your trolley there, but move back please, still refused, so she called security, who told him to move back or leave without his shopping, he did in end think the fact the security guard was 6.6 and about 4 foot wide had dommst to do with it. Lol.Security waited told him to put his stuff on when the customer was packing, waited till he packed his stuff paid and escorted him out, what's so hard in just following rules, would of saved him all the hassle"
"Well if you are so high risk,why are not adhering to the 12 week self isolation ruling then? Can't expect everyone to live the rest of their lives living like cats on a hot tin roof. If you are worried,stay at home."
I would love to pop into a supermarket lol. For the last 7 weeks I have not left my house. I am one of the 1.5 million who have had the shielding letter. I do understand what you are saying about people keeping their distance while in the shops but as Stath says if you are that worried then stay at home. It's really boring though and I'm sure the supermarket delivery drivers think I'm an alcoholic as there is always more Strongbow in my delivery than food. Just stay safe everyone.
"The idiot loves this situation, if the hysteria continues will be no elections in US. Guess who will be still in charge? TRUMP"
"I myself am not a vulnerable person but it irks me to see people who act like children and don't respect others. You know how you should be behaving in public, there's no excuse except for being selfish or ignorant. I have no doubt that such people exist everywhere which is probably why Germany imposed a hefty fine for those without a mask. We have to learn to live with the situation we're in."
"Stath to set the record straight Crohns was not on the governments list, even tho it compromises the immune system, I could not afford to self isolate, unless you were on that list, your employer was not obliged to pay you, you couldn't claim UC neither as you self isolated as your own accord, so me and 1000 of crohns sufferers had no choice but too carry on, now obviously we're in lockdown, and apart from taking the dog out at 6am no one about, or once a fortnight do the shopping as me and John take turns, I do not go out, except to our back garden,if we could of got our shopping delivered we would off, but all slots were booked up a month in advance, wouldn't let you book any further, we still go on everyday too see if any slots never is, so you see unlike some I am more than complying with lockdown, but with an essential worker in my household (Maria) there's still a chance she could bring it home, she comes in the back, gets undressed, puts a dressing gown on, puts her uniform in wash, go upstairs and showers, then clean cloths to try and miminse the risk but there's still a small chance she could, so you see I am more or less isolated as much as I can be."
"June our weekly shop has as much booze as food also, think the cashiers must think were alcoholics also,us and over half the country tho I think. Lol.Keep safe, as for supermarkets people invading my personal space has being a bug bear of mine long before this virus, it's simply called good manners not to reach across people, touching tbem, breathing in there face as you do it, one sentence of excuse me please and I would move, simple as that."
"Micheal I don't think the senate or Congress would allow him to cancel elections, it would go against the principle of there strong belief of there constitution, they'll find a way around it, plus 75% of the USA is open or opening back up, idiots I know, they never had a full lockdown like European countries have you could still go to a restaurant drive through, some even let you in for takeout inside the place, some states still have beauty parlours open, whole families go for a trip to the supermarket its a family outing, loads on a retail forum from states moaning about it, posting pictures of the stores they work packed with these families, my thoughts tho the Yanks are still stupid enough to vote him back in, he has strong support in southern states, and yokel states big on guns."
"Mt have you seen the street party in Middlesbrough UK its the no 1 spot for breaking lockdown in UK, hundreds out at a street party, drinking, dancing, no social distancing, now I've nothing against people enjoying themselves, but do it sensibly, how many people will become infected due to that party and no social distancing, how many innocent people who are abiding by the rules are they going to infect and possibly kill.There's videos someone have posted of this lot partying all over social media, I would of posted it on here but it won't let me.Edited: 3:58 am, May 09, 2020 "
Is Malta open to tourist
"Tracey No, there hoping to have Airports open by July, but flights will be limited,and only from certain countries that are deemed safe."
"Looks as if the hotel industry might have got their way - talks are now ongoing about the airport reopening by 15th June.But, much depends on which countries will be allowed in, if there will be any quarantine for visitors, and if airlines restart flights by then. Ryanair have a schedule from July, so perhaps they won't be ready from mid-June, even if it were possible."
Possible date of reopning is 15 July not June. This shall be confirmed soon by the Tourism minister.
We have flights booked 01 July and 15 July with Ryanair covering both dates just in case!!....every day the rules change so i personally think it will be open early July and quarantine wont then be needed. For instance a week ago they announced here in Ireland that there would be 2 weeks quarantine for arrivals here now today they say that it will only apply to countries with high rates of covid...so its all changing rapidly...and europe needs to try rescue some of the holiday season too
"Air Malta is already making preparations for when they can start ""normal"" operations again. Up till now the main idea was of travel corridors, with opening the airport to all destinations planned at the very end. But everything is still obviously subject to change given the rapidly changing circumstances we face."
"69A little wrong. The Tourism Minsiter (Portelli) has indeed suggested that the airport could reopen by that date in JUNE, not July.And, it's the PM who will announce a set date, 'in a few days' from now according to the press.Daily flights continue now anyway, for 'repatriation' purposes, so it's not going to be onerous to scale them up a little to bring in some limited commercial services on, or just after, 15th June."
The ban is until 15 June but local newspapers mainly reported that the airport is expected to reopen on July 15. The Tourism Minister has implied that it may open beforehand but from what I've gathered nothing seems set in stone yet. In all honesty I hadn't heard much about it possibly opening from 15 June.
It has been confirmed that the airport (and ports) will reopen on 1 July
"Mt that's to all countries or selective ones is it.We cancelled ours a while back, decided not worth it, nothing to do with Malta they've handled it really well, unfortunately our government haven't there a bunch of buffoons, scientists here have said relaxing lockdown is too soon, it's the governments decision too they advised too soon, it's political and economical not scientific based why our goons have relaxed restrictions, some have said possibly a second wave which could be worse than the first, so based on that and There could of being Quarantine which isn't a holiday, plus we'd have to quarantine for 14 days when home it'd mean a month off work, which John is back at this Week, and I'm back end of June, the grown up kids have worked through it all, one from Home, the other an essential worker, so decided not to rebook. Take care, stay safeEileen"
No further information is available yet. Formal announcement will be given on Monday.
"Mt something tells me selective ones, Spain done that, and UK isn't on the list, can't say I blame them, mind you a lot of businesses in Spain are saying its good there opening up, but as brits make up over 50% of its tourism its still going to be hard going, which if Malta did the same it'd be a similar situation as brits make up over 50% of there tourism also, not that brits can fly anywhere yet unless exceptional circumstances as they haven't released us to go on holidays yet, we can't even stay over night in UK not alone abroad, which don't get me wrong that's a good thing at the moment in my eyes, mind you they are talking about certain bars, restaurants, cafes, Hotels opening in July with strict measures in place, so we'll have too see what that brings us."
Selective tourism was being pushed by the tourism minister but we'll have to wait until tomorrow to confirm
"Mt let's hope they don't, as I know someone who's booked a flight for 2nd July, it'll be the last Straw I think for them, as there not happy about not being able to go to Malta as they have friends there that there worried about."
"I hope they take everything into perspective and consider the wellbeing of the population when making their decisions. Up to now Malta wasn't badly hit, but allowing high-risk citizens in may curb efforts taken to control the situation."
"Mt I see your point, but let's be honest Malta has handled things superbly I think, look at the hash Boris and Co are making in UK.My guess they may do similar to Spain and it'll only be low risk countries citizens allowed in at first such as Germany, Denmark, China (who have it under control now) etcEdited: 1:37 pm, May 31, 2020 "
"Malta Airport and port open from 1 July 19 countries allowed entry, the UK is not on the list of 19.No quarantine for the 19 allowed entry."
ras far as I understand it is not weddings that are banned but the big gatherings that take place after the ceremony.
