"""“Please take advantage of lifting this mandate. We need our businesses to operate,” said Mayor Carolyn Goodman, requesting that Gov. Sisolak shorten the projected shutdown in a public comment to city councilmembers.Goodman says she wants to focus on keeping Vegas residents employed.She referenced how in the last 20 years we have survived the West Nile Virus in 2002, SARS in 2004, the Bird Flu in 2005, Ecoli in 2006, Swine Flu in 2009, Ebola in 2004, Zika Virus in 2016, and every year the general flu, “yet we are still here.”“A full shutdown will cripple the states recovery for years because we are a tourism economy that depends on being open for business,” said Goodman referring to the 42 million visitors Las Vegas received last year and 3 million Nevadans.""https:/…"
"""Goodman says she wants to focus on keeping Vegas residents employed.""She might want to be a little concerned about keeping them, and the tourists, safe."
"Even if all places reopened today, flights are very limited, and people willing to venture there are very limited as well"
"At what point in social distancing requirements does it become feasible to re-open Las Vegas attractions? Until the reported infection numbers level out or decrease, it seems unwise to re-open."
"It's good she's addressing the disastrous economic realities of this situation for the community, but the priority is reducing / minimizing potential exposure of all involved to the bug. That machine is in motion now, looks like. Lots of edges to this COVID sword...and most of them suck. There's no way to predict a timeline...too many unknowns. We'll get through this..including the Vegas workforce...a day at a time."
It seems she has more interest in my tourist $$ than she has in my health - I fully understand that some people will suffer financial hardship in coming weeks & months but equally some people will get sick and some will die.People can be helped to recover from financial hardship but not from death.
"I am sure everyone has seen that graph about flatting the curve so that the apex doesn't overwhelm the healthcare system. But was the graph doesn't show is the line that kills the economy and for how long that more flatten curve will kill the economy. Everyone thinks that tidal waves are one massively tall wave, but it is really usually just a few higher feet water surge that flows over land destroying everything. Poverty is the #1 killer in the world and soon or later we are going to have to accept a certain number of deaths from the virus each week or risk poverty becoming America's #1 killer."
This was taken this morning. You can see how seriously guests have taken the guidelines. https:/…1
"New York City waited too long and they are sending Navy hospital ships to help with the potential number of cases.It's fine to reevaluate frequently, but the CDC guidance is for far longer than 30 days, right now.People need to stay home, read a book, maybe get into a Twitter war, and wait it out.I certainly understand the impact this has on a city like Las Vegas, but we need to deal with this crisis first."
"She's a politician and unless she's also a medical professional with deep knowledge of infectious diseases, she should shut up (CC: the White House)"
Don't forget that the medical profession will kill your life to keep you from dying from a disease.
"It's not surprising at all, though.One of the big draws of Las Vegas is that it's a place where adults are allowed to make their own choices, even when those choices involve participating in risky behavior.And of course, Vegas is all about money...for the ones who are making it and the ones who are spending it.I highly doubt Sisolak is going to budge. He sounded pretty serious."
"Speaking of good books to read, I may just break out Hunter S Thompson's classic...""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of The American Dream""or O'Brien's ""Leaving Las Vegas""Those just might be currently and sadly relevant...Edited: 4:29 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Its all about hitting ""peak"". And nobody in the USA will know that anytime soon because we don't have nearly the testing necessary to get to that point. With a complete national quarantine I guess its possible Vegas could reopen in some scaled back version of itself at some point after Memorial Day. Its hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when we can't even see the tunnel yet."
"Just watch the local and national and worldwide data of new cases vs. recovered.Social distancing plus sanitizing, if maintained, will reduce the chances of community spread. Then the # of new cases will fall as fewer sick people infect fewer others.Taiwan did it really well. Italy is a disaster. They waited too long and also didn't have the medical facilities to begin with.As this grows in foreign places worldwide travel will suffer for a long time."
"""Don't forget that the medical profession will kill your life to keep you from dying from a disease."" Does this make sense to anyone?"
What I was trying to say is that doctors can get so focused on saving us from the virus that the rest of society dies. Talk to a terminal cancer patient toward the end of their life about how they have to balance their wanting to have some quality of life and the doctor's focus on beating the cancer for one more day.
"Economically I am starting to wonder if we are doing the right thing. That is the point the mayor is trying to make without saying it. How much money is a life worth? This may sound sick but in the big picture is $3,000,000,000,000 worth 10,000 lives? I am not saying I am an expert on the total expect life loss and the total impact on the economy. I am just tossing those numbers out there. Do you know how tough a decision congress and the white house have to make? At least they are working together now. I really want to know your thoughts on this weather politically correct or not. FLWFan, not calling you out, but if you were president what would you do?Edited: 7:28 pm, March 18, 2020 "
This happens with every pandemic. No one takes it seriously unless it affects them. This might not even peak until June/July in a North America.
Have you seen Vegas's target market? Are you shocked that they can't stop these yokels from coming in? No.The mayor needs to put the health of her city above everything. It's sad to see her take the Goodman name and put it in the crapper with this behavior.
"Well, it might come down to a Darwinian thing - “cleansing of the herd?”Hunt"
Well Hunt I hope you don't think a disease killing off senior citizens is an example Darwinism. Executive summary: It's not.
The Mayor knows that will never happen. She's grandstanding for her constituents.
"""Do you know how tough a decision congress and the white house have to make? ""COV-19 has hit a couple of congressmen."

I was asked directly so I answered. And I'm going to answer Hunt. I have no idea what you're talking about about Hunt. There was no coronavirus activity after the impeachment hearing. The president of the United States is known as the most powerful man in the world. When that man and his media enablers continued for weeks portraying this as a hoax they did nobody any good. The most recent numbers I heard were that 85% of Democrats take this seriously while among Republican is closer to 55%. That can be attributed almost solely to lies told by the president and repeated by Fox State News. I will say no more as long as no one else asked me questions.
"""Citation FLW?""You must be joking. As recently as today he called it the Chinese virus. I don't know how else to answer, everything I said is easy to find online. I usually ask for citations when I'm pretty sure the person doesn't have any. I and everybody else with the internet does with very little effort.Edited: 10:12 pm, March 18, 2020 "
“yet we are still here.” - Some aren’t. 13
"Should I get the sheep,his tweet on Feb 24, that the coronavirus was contained ? Or his tweet shortly after that anybody who wanted a test can get a test, and they are beautiful tests? Stop defending the windbag..He was late to the party and trying to cover his tracks..Finally he has gotten on track...Too late for criticism, but not too late too point out to the sheep who think he was on top of this...Facts have a way of ruining a good narrative"
"Well, maybe President Trump should have called it the “One person, who ate a live bat at the Wuhan Night Market virus?”[Speculation Alert]When, and if (very big IF), the truth is published, this will come down to an attempt to weaponize, and distribute a bio weapon, which got out of control, before it could be distributed.Hope I am wrong, and just par and.It ain’t the “Eat a Live Bat Flu.”Hunt"
"Dawg #32,And some, who tried to warn the world, mysteriously disappeared, permanently, and quickly.Hunt"
"Since I have family in the medical,field who are on front lines right now, I can say without question, Blotus blew it...tests were not available,he downplayed it for weeks..Time is and was of the essence..He can say whatever he like to his base, but his words are on record, only because of his twitter addiction.."
And the mayor of LV is pathetic...
"Hunt,Indeed, my good man. They are mysteries for sure. 13"
"Que dog thanks for the quick backup, like I said I didn't know if you was joking about citations because it's all out there.As for Hunt, I hate to be cliched but tinfoil hat on tight?"
It’s there for any person who doesn’t drink the koolaid
"FLWFan, thank you for answering. I did ask you directly. Anyone have an opinion that letting the virus run its course would have been a better economic decision? Just throwing it out there."
"Here is his tweet, hope nobody thought stock market looked good like he said , 35% ago...The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!Feb 24"
"I am not on Tweeter, but wife is on 4 conference calls per day, from the CDC, starting at 5:00am here.Then she has one with WHO, and 2 with AZ Health, then 2 more, with her healthcare corporation.Have there been issues, and problems?YesIs much being done now?YesWill this get better?Only time will tell.Hunt"
I actually was joking FLW. I figured you would get it as I’m not a critic of yours. Everything doesn’t need to be serious such as the Lv forum.
"Issues and problems? Without a doubt, particularly since he downplayed it for weeks..Has he finally gotten on board, and trying to do what is necessary ? Yes, reluctantly Will it get better? At some point, but not anytime soon"
We have 119 confirmed cases in our province (US would call a state) and all restaurants are closed I can’t go to a gym everything is closed. This is the right measure but the supply chain scares us. Just personal opinion.
"for watching the forum, and trying to book a room , May is when if not sooner Vegas will open up. I will continually book flight and room. If they cancel I will just re-book and continue to re-book. Rates are so cheap why not confirm"
"Days before Trump took office, there were transition meetings with Trump's team and people from the outgoingadministration. Rather than heed the warnings from Obama's team, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic. At the meetings, Trump's team was dismissive and arrogant and questioned the usefulness of transition meetings. They knew better.Edited: 11:31 pm, March 18, 2020 "
i encourage many to watch the Netflix episode of dirty money on trump.
"If you ask me, I’d say 3 weeks shut down is about right. 4 weeks is excessive. 3 weeks technically is not a month, such as unemployment, etc. missing a month pay or mortgage or rent is serious, but 3 weeks sounds and feels much better. Oh, okay, only 3 weeks. 3 weeks sounds a lot shorter than one month.In sales, marketing or advertising, we chose these words very carefully with clear intention to mislead or misguide how you think. 7 days are better than one week, 4 weeks are better than month.Edited: 12:01 am, March 19, 2020 "

"People need to stop focusing on the deaths like that's the only thing to be concerned about. 20% of people with this need to be hospitalized.

People still get very sick from it even without needing to be hospitalized.Lastly, because this is a lower respiratory virus, they're still doing research on the fact that it might permanently scar lung tissue or the like.

The PPE is in the mail.
President Trump has handled this bigly virus better than any other country. He has done and will continue to handle every situation better than any past president. This is more serious than any situation in the nation and world wide history and he has done everything possible to prevent the spread of the virus. He was even the first to close his casinos.
...and had the foresight to close his university and his foundation.

What an embarassment Trump is? He can't even answer a harmless simple question. Worst president ever.
He has personal issues with the media so it’s more about who is asking the question than what the topic is.
For the most part journalism is dead in this country. They have morphed into left wing get Trump at no cost dogs. Most people in this country despise them for an abundance of reasons. This country needs to come together at this time instead of antagonizing and attacking each other.  President Trump is doing an extraordinary job considering the enormity of current events and past events like hoaxes. I believe his approval rating is above 55%.

I know he was somehow referring to me. I was referring to him and the dishonest media. How many times have they had breaking news bombshells that turned out to be fabricated from unknown sources. Too many to count. If they can’t get Trump for something they’ll just make things up. Get over the election in advance because we have Trump for 5 more years and I wish more.
"Look around, Kat, the good people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky are beginning to wake up.

"Yeah, but too bad DT is always in his ""I know best..I have this sixth sense"" zone."
"So, I'll respond to these one more time, at risk of being charged with hypocrisy regarding political comments in here.He did spit-shine some things that weren't happening; he constantly overuses the terms 'beautiful' and 'incredible', when at times the beautiful and incredible things aren't even functioning yet; he misrepresented some things when he shouldn't have, despite the likelihood he was making an attempt to calm the public regarding the situation..doesn't excuse it. Unfortunately, he's just not a gaggable human being; as a general supporter, my worst complaints about him are his use of words and dressing things up.Regarding the disbanding of the pandemic force, it happened. He has routinely asked for CDC budget cuts since he's been in office; the irony is the overall budget distributions for the CDC have actually INCREASED under his 3+ year stint ( because Congress has to pass spending bills..they rejected his CDC budget proposals in this specific area and funded increases).As for attacking the press ( whom in fact don't always or seldom focus on truths from either side of the spectrum), anybody who has endured the onslaught he has since his inauguration is naturally going to resist some journalistic sensationalism if he perceives it as such. I think he perceives most of it that way. Let's face it ( or I'll suggest it), there just isn't much journalistic integrity left from our media these days. There are a few, agreed ( and even fewer who are unbiased).Most reasonable folk ( in spite of the recent positive polling in favor of Trump's COVID handling cited in an earlier thread post) would at least agree he's now engaged on this situation. That scares some of you..it shouldn't. Even Schumer isn't bad-mouthing him of late. It's a shame that the current debacle had to occur for the politicians to work together on something for the good of the folks that put them in office and pay their salaries, isn't it? We won't go into other, unrelated Trump mistakes..there's plenty. Pick any guy/ person and cast the first stone. I'll just say this, to be clear ( which is a very disgusting oft used political phrase)..I voted for him in 2016 and unless they produce photos of him and a goat in a barn somewhere( or something really off-the-wall beyond routine verbal gaffs), I'll do it again this fall. It's about the conservative policy/ issue stances..he's accomplished some things I agree with. If you disagree with those, fine..vote him out. If you disagree on moral grounds, fine..vote him out. If you don't like his hair and think that's critical, fine..vote him out. That's your strongest weapon to make him irrelevant."

Agree with you Mayor. We live in N Nevada and feel its time to re-open. We've lived thru many viruses. Sisolak is playing King Tut. Nevada has a very LOW pandemic total we can't be compared with NEW YORK.
Vegas will reopen. and Biden is the biggest idiot ever. If it wasn't for the Teleprompter he would not no what to say. In a public forum he said he was running for the Senate. Idiot idiot idiot . Looking for June opening in Las Vegas. I made my Reservations and booked my flight. Biden is an absolute idiot
I don’t know what I’m responding to as so many removed posts. Trump will be re-elected.
Go on and open up for Please go ... be our test subjects. Much appreciated. Oh and stay safe ? Hahahaha
“ Sisolak is playing King Tut. ”Discuss this in your break-out groups for 10 minutes.Appoint someone who will speak for your group and present a minimum of three similarities between Governor Sisolak and King Tutankhamun.
Maybe it's for a play that the governor is cast as King Tut.
No - old man Biden will not be elected ! Better hope not or we're in trouble.
"Gloria, you're always on the run nowRunning after somebody, you gotta get him somehowI think you've got to slow down before you start to blow itI think you're headed for a breakdown. So, be careful not to show itYou really don't remember, was it something that Trump said?Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?"
more than we have been since last election ?
Gloria....so NY residents won't be visiting Vegas ?
I'm curious about the King Tut reference.
Probably something at Luxor?

"Perhaps THIS King Tut?https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/King_Tut_(Dozierverse)Bonus question: what connects the 60's ""Batman"" series, ""Love Story,"" Charles Dickens and ""Bride of the Gorilla""?"
"Salty, we’ll see. Can you say 4 more years? Ironically I am no a Trump fan. But, what leadership Biden is showing right now. He is in his cave doing nothing. Actually he may be getting treatment for dementia or Alzheimer’s. He is not as sharp as he once was. Biden was the safe choice 4 years ago, but not now. The power struggling from the liberals and moderates within the power of the Democratic Party is hindering themselves against Trump. Now, if Biden can stand up to Trump in a debate he has a chance, but I he isn’t as sharp as he once was."
"Road trip, what you say , I agree with! But trump is a goner regardless...He won several states by tiny margins, that won’t happen again..."
Top Dem leaders are taking turns to make sure Biden does not go out in public calling it protective custody.
"Here is the solution, that almost everyone in this forum will agree to. KTINCA, would be a better option than Trump or Biden . I do think the best person running for President would have been Sen Any Klubachar (excuse the spelling). She has a great track record, she looks for solutions not blame."
"I didn’t vote for him and I am slightly to the right. Most important he lacks character. He is an egomaniac. He had done great things for the economy. I agree with 75% but he is a bad representative of our country. But he has handled this better than most. Yes, he says stupid crap and is a big bully. But he is showing hope. Also, he has worked to get the stimulus done. There are many out there who I would rather see as President. I am in CA so my vote doesn’t matter, I would vote for Biden if he pick the right running mate.Edited: 1:35 pm, April 25, 2020 "
UBS doesn't expect Disneyland and Disneyworld USA to reopen till 2021How can you reopen casinos if outdoor venues cant? 20% occupancy and only playing slots 6 ft away from all other players??? Do you have to wait for an empty elevator?
Amy Klobuchar is very effective.
"Wow I agree with Liberals. Lol... The problem with politics is it is about red and blue not about America. Shumar, Pelosi, Trump, McConell are all guilty of it."
"""Here is the solution, that almost everyone in this forum will agree to. KTINCA, would be a better option than Trump or Biden ""Thank you for the kind words. I'm afraid that I am over-qualified, as I have a degree in Political Science. I'm afraid that the campaign would be a political nightmare, as I actually have inhaled in the past."
What good is false/fake hope ? I'd rather trust someone that I trust.
"Gen where you been, we need a realistic and practical voice like yours."

"""Ha ha any anti trump posts are deleted.What a shambles TA and indeed America has become""Anti Trump posts are usually not deleted on TA because it is dominated by democrat posters. Anti Trump posts are usually dominant and pro-Trump post and posters are more heavily deleted. It's a numbers game, and TA doesn't even enter into the deletions."
