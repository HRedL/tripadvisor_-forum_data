"Why do so many people seem to recommend local insect repellent versus the stuff you can buy overseas?In an effort to avoid having Dengue ruin our vacation, we've been very serious about mosquito control measures.Everyone seems to recommend repellent, but I've been surprised about numerous comments saying not to rely on foreign brands but to rely on the stuff you can buy at the 7-Eleven in Bangkok.I've always understand that there are only two or three effective active ingredients, primarily Deet, though there's also Picardin and a couple of other smaller ones.Is this just an old wives tale, or does anyone have reason or experience to trust those local brands more?Thanks!"
"I've always found the local brands work as equally well as the overseas brands, so don't bother to clutter my luggage!!"
"""Is this just an old wives tale, or does anyone have reason or experience to trust those local brands more?""There is no definitive ""this is best"" brand (otherwise all the other brands would not exist, local people like their local brands, personally if I use it at all i.e. when somewhere up country I use one with a good concentration of Deet, but the best thing is to cover up at vulnerable times. Lightweight long trousers with socks and shoes NOT flip flops and lightweight long sleeved shirts in the evening works wonders."
"Thanks, that's helpful. Lightweight clothes make obvious sense given the heat, but don't mosquitos bite right through it?"
I think (not certain though) that most of the recommendations to buy in the 7/11s etc come from UK visitors where it is much more expensive than it is in Thailand plus as Mitch says there is no need to take it from home and clutter your luggage up. Plus of course there will be people like me who have found a brand that works and are reluctant to change even though other brands have exactly the same ingredients.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Mozzie seldom bite through cloth....which if you like you can impregnate with Picard.Dengue takes about 5 days to materialise so it is quite possible you might not get it until you return home.Anything with DEET is effective, you might find lowlands are a lot cheaper and some people go by the smell.Nothing is 100% thoughEdited: 2 years ago "
"tentaguasu I have never yet been bitten through any item of clothing, of course you do still need to be aware as your hands and face are still available to the little beggars. (Even I would not advocate wearing gloves and a mask in Thailand) :-)"
"I am from UK and I buy the local repellant in Thailand because it is much cheaper, still contains DEET and it saves luggage space, and saves carrying fluids that could possibly leak in luggage due to the differences in pressure on planes. If there is some other brand you prefer then use it. It is irrelevant how much it cost as long as it has ingredients that work.Although mosquitoes may not bite through thick clothes they can occassionaly fly up trouser legs or get up untucked in T shirts."
I have been bitten through lightweight pants. I have never been bitten through jeans.
"In 25 years in the tropics, I have been bitten many times under clothing, but seldom by a mozzie ..I'm sure if you can be bothered there will be a bite league table for critters that bite through or under clothing.I very much doubt that the Aedes mosquito ranks high on that list as it is a relatively small mosquito.So the conclusion I would draw is that for protection against dengue, light long legged/armed apparel is one of the most effective protections.Even spray isn't 100%."
"DEET is a very powerful solvent and can destroy some fabrics and even watch crystals, so I would be extremely careful when bringing it on an airline flight. Deep Woods Off wipes (towelettes in foil packets) travel really well but I wouldn't trust a squeeze bottle.While it's smart to be careful about dengue, the numbers of mosquitoes aren't great compared to the woods of Wisconsin."
"And then, there's Alaska!"
Oh; my mistake!
Sketolene and Soffell are ones I have used ( Thai brands). Also I have sometimes used Citronella oil when travelling in India. Jungle places and near canals or potted plants are where you are most likely to come across mosquitoes because of the stagnant water. Many Thais keep fish in pots of water lillies to eat the larvae. If you have mozzies in your room you can buy big cans of Baygon in a 7- eleven to spray in the room and bathroom just before you go out for the evening. By keeping mosquito screens or windows closed from just before dusk you can prevent most of them coming indoors. Otherwise just hope the geckos in your bathroom are hungry !Edited: 2 years ago 
"r Cycle is talking nonsense - if you did any research at all you'd find that DEET and pinardin are the only ones that offer long term protection - ""natural"" repellants are ineffective and short-lived and in fact to make wild assertions about who is and isn't a ""magnet"" to mosquitos is just totally ignoring the science.Edited: 2 years ago "
Yelvington - what's the Dengue rate in Wisconsin these days?
"I have lost count of the amount of times I have been bitten through clothing. It is a big problem not just in Asia, but also here in the tropics of Northern Australia, where we also have cases of dengue. I agree with #1, we always buy our repellent locally, affordable, convenient and very effective."
"Unfortunately it seems that some products work better for some people yet not others. Maybe it’s something to do with individual chemistry. Who knows. It’s probably best to stick with what’s been proven to be effective for you and if you bring it with you, make sure you wrap it well in plastic in the event that it might leak in transit. Just as an aside, many people overlook the back of the neck and ears which can be vulnerable. Ankles and feet are also tasty for the little blighters when people are sitting in a restaurant or similar and can be tempted to slip their feet out of their shoes."
All that talk about dengue fever makes me think it is an epidemic and that I should cancel my trip to Bangkok! My kids are mossies magnets!
"I get a 40 or 50% deet solution from Boots the chemist at Gateway, Ekamai. Has always worked for me, whereas the 7-11 stuff never has, neither has that ubiquitous panacea, Tiger Balm."
does anyone recognize or have an idea where to buy one of these? friend brought it back from Thailand and it worked very well for me but cant find anything about it anywhere... Please help https:/…
