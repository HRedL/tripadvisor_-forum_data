"I have just read a post on Facebook that says all foreigners are to be denied entry to the Gilis as of today 15th march is this true or is it just Facebook rumours. I am booked to stay on Gili Gede, Gili Air and Gili Meno from the 26th."
"Hi,I believe it’s true for the northern gilis, possibly not for Gili Gede. Cheers"
"You may read it,6. Re: Gili Islands Closure?Mar 15, 2020, 12:37 PMCONFIRM. Gilis are closed for 14 days from outside visitors, it has been announced by West Nusa Tenggara Governor."
"Thanks for the confirmation, looking like we might not even get into bali the way this thing is developing."
Yes Eddie you are correctHoliday islands close down over coronavirus fears https:/…d299eb97-bb29-487e-b4c7-900e7a14a8bd
"Actually this information is still unclear. First there was an announcement that the ""gateway to Nothern Gilis"" would be closed and everyone assumed a lock down. Then the local government announced, not a lock down only stopping the fast boats to the Northern Gilis.President Jokowi said only central Government can decree lockdowns, not local govenrment.Then we have announcements from the local government saying no tourists can take the boats from Lombok either - at the same time we have announcements no lockdowns. So actually it is all a bloody mess and nobody knows yet 100% even those living on the islands are giving conflicting information.For the fast boat access from Bali I saw an official announcement which included Gili Gede.Edited: 12:14 am, March 17, 2020 "
A friend of mine has posted photos of tourists leaving Bangsal Harbour for Gilis this morning. You can also see a announcement from the governor which is pinned to the top of this notice board. Access to & from Gilis is open from Lombok.www.facebook.com/groups/LombokGilisTI
Thank you for the information Lombok_Lover I am now unsure that i can even get to Bali as the FCO has issued an advisory on travel to Indonesia
"We are currently in Ubud which is really quiet compared to what it should be but everything is open. We have travelled the island and all the sites are very quiet also.We emailed foreign office and travel company we booked our flight through for clarification (as per instruction from airline) as not supposed to fly back to Scotland until 24th. As yet we have heard nothing from either of them other than an initial automated message.We are just adapting our trip as we go. Lots of options and cheaper deals for accommodation due to lack of tourists. Supposed to go to Nusa for a couple of days but after all the rumours we thought better to stay on Bali in case we need to cut it short and get to the airport. Not booking into big hotels (we normally don't anyway) as do not want to find ourselves quarantined if one person in a hotel gets sick, booking small villa in Semanyuk just for two days then assess where to go next etc.We are still going to try a trip to Nusa with snorkeling but will come back to Bali same day.While the world seems to be going into meltdown we are just taking it a day at a time, not stressing and just taking all the precautions we would be back at home although after watching everybody panic buying I wonder what will happen here if the proverbial hits the fan as the general feeling is the Indonesian government is at best being economical with the truth/reality of the situation. The only real difference with me us that being Scottish I hate to part with my hard earned cash, so when I travel I love a bargain and enjoy the fun of haggling. I still haggle for the fun but now I end up giving them what they initially asked for because the locals are really struggling. My tips in restaurants are a wee bit bigger as well.Anyways, apologies for this rambling message, if it is any consolation I have had to endure listening Bryan Adams and Ronan Keating while writing this!Edited: 7:59 am, March 17, 2020 "
"The Indonesian government just announced this afternnon that effective Friday 20 March Visa Free Arrival (BVK), Visa on Arrival and Free Diplomatic / Service Visa policies are suspended for 1 month. That means you cannot come into Indonesia on a tourist visa."
"You may read,Due to fly out to Bali on Saturday number 12 and 13 in this forum."
"Sarwa, for anyone just viewing the Lombok forum, as I do then that post is not visible."
My neighbour's son is still in Trawangan as of this morning. I am not sure if only new arrivals are affected but not those already there?
