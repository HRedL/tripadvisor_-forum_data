"Just booked to travel to Jamaica and have heard that there is an epidemic of Dengue Fever. I'll be travelling with husband and 3 children 5,5 & 8 yrs old. Is this something that I should be concerned about? Nothing on foreign office or anywhere stating not to travel. Perhaps someone who lives there or travels frequently to areas with dengue Fever would have a better understanding. Thank you!"
What area of Jamaica are you traveling to?
Where did you hear there was an epidemic?
It's been in the paper for a couple of days ...jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/201…Edited: 1 year ago 
Robins bay and st Anne's bay
"ugh, I didn't realize this -- we just spent 9 nights in Negril and Montego Bay in Dec with my 4 and 5 yo. This would have stressed me out too, had I known about it....."
"Nothing at all about Dengue in Western Jamaica. They get more rain in St. Ann so there are more mosquitos so perhaps that's causing a Dengue outbreak. In Western Jamaica you see the most cases of Dengue in October generally.No matter the time of year though you are always at risk, the dengue carrying mosquitos don't go to Florida for the winter. Use repellant, 30% DEET is adequate and use it during the day - Dengue mosquitos are day-biting."
"I mean, Westmoreland is listed right there in the article RG."

"I didn't read the article, sorry. I haven't heard of a single case of Dengue since I've been here."
