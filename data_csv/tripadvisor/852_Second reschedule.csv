"Canceled our Los Angeles trip for mid June and booked a trip to Chicago with friends instead (planning on Airbnb so no hotel) July-30-aug 4. (Flights are booked) I’ve never been to Chicago before. Hearing about the phase Chicago is in and moving toward, I’m wondering if we should reschedule for October. We don’t have any crazy plans—just a fun relaxing time w friends. I know even October might not pan out but just trying to get a handle on what’s possible. So far lots of Airbnb’s are available for late July-aug and the ones I’ve corresponded with are encouraging (of course)—all generally can cancel without penalty through near end of July. The masks are a current must in md so if that’s the case in Chicago it’s not a problem. I suppose bare minimum we’d like to walk around a bit, hit some bars and restaurants and bike around a bit. I know no one on here has a crystal ball—guess I’m just looking for some feedback on what’s on the horizon in a best guess scenario."
Not sure it matters but looking to stay in Pilsen in case it matters.
The guidelines the state and city have for reopening are very strict. Even in October we will still have a lot of restrictions.
"Nobody here knows what’s possible at this point. There’s lots of moving pieces involved including political ones. Personally, I wouldn’t do any nonessential travel until a vaccine is developed and there’s some sense of normalcy. How are you planning on getting around once you get here? Ride share and taxis are virtually nonexistent. Don’t even think about using public transit."
"Honestly why come here for the first time and not see the city at its best? Restaurants may or may be opened. Same with museums, lake path,etc. You will be trading in one closed off city for another but adding in a flight. And taking public transportation back and forth to your Airbnb. It’s going to be a lonely tourist season. Stay home and that’s said with no malicious."
It's very unlikely that bars and the bike path will be open in July. You should plan for summer 2021.
Don’t come. We just heard today that Illinois (read:Chicago) will not hit it’s peak until mid-June. Restaurants and bars will remain closed until there is a vaccine... next year. October is too soon. Why would you book flights for July and then say that October may be too soon? You know that it’s too soon. Why would you book flights before you found out if it was safe to come to Chicago? Pilsen (Latinx) is not an area for a visitor in this Pandemic. The African American and Latinx communities are suffering greatly. Selfish Airbnb owners may be taking advantage of the many closed hotels in the city. Stay away. Don’t bring anything to us and we won’t give anything to you.
Chicago is not an Airbnb town. Before Covid we would say give us cross streets before you book. Pilsen can be iffy and Airbnb tends to lie about exact locations. As for July no. As for Oct I would guess no too. Save your money and come when everything will be open.
You won't be able to do much. Bars probably won't be open yet unless some dining places that have bars. But then again the U.S isn't going to shut down everything for 6 months not in this age. Unfortunately they are more concerned of the economy more so and making sure they have enough equipment and personnel to care for those that do get sick.
"Restaurants and bars will remain closed until there’s a vaccine?? That can’t possibly be true? There’s no guarantee that’s vaccine will even be developed...The quickest time frame for a vaccine to date is 4 years, for the measles. There was never a vaccine developed for SARS, and that was 18 years ago?!"
"I agree with the above that this summer is too soon.We have no idea what will be going on in late July. And you should see Chicago for the first time when it's at its best. Weather starts to play a role in October; we had snow on Halloween in 2019 (freakish but it happened). The Chicago Marathon is scheduled for early October tho it'll probably be cancelled. Until it is, hotels and rentals may be showing little availability for that weekend.In normal times, Pilsen would be an edgy choice for an apartment rental but not necessarily unsafe. Now it could put you in harm's way from the virus. Yesterday there were news stories about nearly full airplanes flying in and out of O'Hare, including occupied middle seats on United and American Airlines. That doesn't seem like an acceptable risk to me but we each have to decide for ourselves.Edited: 6:52 am, May 12, 2020 "
Rachel & Margarita = I'm guessing are from the same family. There's a reason that every outdoor and indoor large gathering here over the summer has been cancelled. If you don't believe us - follow this thread = https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g35805…
"Plus we should all be taking seriously the prediction that September/October will bring a second wave of COVID-19, possibly worse than the first."
"Carlo is almost correct but bars and restaurants will be able to open in phase 4 at greatly diminished patronage. Right now, we're just beginning stage 2. Festivals and large gatherings will happen much later in stage 5. Here're phases 4 & 5 of the Illinois reopening plan:Phase 4 - Revitalization: The rate of infection among those tested and the number of patients admitted to the hospital continues to decline. All gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed, restaurants and bars reopen, travel resumes, child care and schools reopen under guidance from the IDPH. Face coverings and social distancing are the norm.Phase 5 - Illinois Restored: With a vaccine or highly effective treatment widely available or the elimination of any new cases over a sustained period, the economy fully reopens with safety precautions continuing. Conventions, festivals and large events are permitted, and all businesses, schools, and places of recreation can open with new safety guidance and procedures in place reflecting the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic.Don't plan on coming here until next year."
"OP - if you don't believe us - perhaps Dr. Fauci can convince you - https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…Edited: 11:50 am, May 12, 2020 "
We were planning on coming to Chicago sometime this summer or early fall until the virus threat halted our plans. I can’t imagine coming to Chicago when it’s not fully open and functional. There is so much to see and do that I would want a first time visitor to truly enjoy their visit. October would probably be more promising as far as the virus threat but as others said the weather can be iffy. I have been to Chicago 50+ times over the years and only once to a B&B. It was a bit sketchy so do be cautious about that. Most of the tourist attractions near downtown so staying in Pilsen may would be less convenient and perhaps somewhat sketchy as others have commented. That being said Chicago is my favorite city when it comes to architecture.
"""There was never a vaccine developed for SARS, and that was 18 years ago""The U.S. didn't try hard for it because it didn't affect them. With Covid-19 it is so more likely will try much harder to find a vaccine."
"@ jordansbulls: you're correct that SARS didn't affect the USA. However, Human Immunodeficiency Virus did and it is 50 years old and there is still no vaccine. Dr. Fauci spearheaded the research. We do not know when there will be a vaccine for Covid-19 and it's mutations."
"There are already multiple vaccines for Covid19 in clinical trials. With many, many more in preclinical trials. It is not a matter of if, just when. B."
"Not sure why you would guess that but no. Not related or even know each other. Thanks for the link, not so much for the tude."
"Thanks everyone (mostly) for the heads up and info. I get different info from people that live there. I'm keeping both trips booked as I'm not out anything and can transfer to banked points if needed. I need to have something to look forward to but am a realist so if it needs to be canceled/rescheduled that's fine too. And no, I""m not looking to 'bring anything' to you. eyeroll."
I'm not sure what different information you're getting. I live here. Everything is closed. We are not on track to move to phase 3 let alone phase 4 that allows bars to open. The mayor just said the lake isn't opening. It would be a horrible vacation to sit in your Airbnb and eat takeout.
"A foolish mistake on your part. Why did you waste Chicagoans time and effort on your part if you already know it all and have no intention of paying attention? Your attitude (or “tude” as you call it). Leaves a lot to be desired. Do not come the Chicago this year.Edited: 11:51 am, May 14, 2020 "
I don’t believe I did that. I was looking for clarification and more information. I’m not sure why you wasted your own time responding.
"You got clarification and information and in 20 answers from Chicagoans it was unanimously: DON'T COME. You're the one who got snippy to regular TA members who gave you good information. Personally, I now hope that you do come and experience a closed city and have nothing to do once you're here. You deserve that freedom.Edited: 12:27 pm, May 14, 2020 "
Thanks! I'll start packing!
Thank you msmejkal! I really do appreciate the info.

We’re moving to Phase 3 later this month. https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
"The news we're on track to reach Phase 3 at the end of May is the best news in weeks. Unfortunately, restaurants cannot reopen for eat-in dining and bars can't open until Phase 4. Let's all hope nothing happens to derail us! And moving to Phase 3 doesn't really affect most tourist activities either in case anyone not from here is unclear about it."
"Phase 3What is allowed: Manufacturing, offices, retail, barbershops and salons can reopen to the public with capacity and other limits and safety precautions. All gatherings limited to 10 or fewer people are allowed.Restrictions: Face coverings and social distancing are the norm.Tourists don’t come here for a haircut.Edited: 9:14 pm, May 14, 2020 "
Carlo - We get it. Relax.B.
"Lollapalooza, Taste of Chicago, other summer festivals canceled by cityhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment…"
I’d reschedule.
"""Restaurants and bars will remain closed until there’s a vaccine??""Not going to happen. It is possible a vaccine may never happen."
"Indoor dining in restaurants is supposed to resume with Phase 4, which appears will occur in early July, assuming there is no backsliding in the number of cases. We are currently in Phase 3, which permits outdoor dining. Bars (i.e., unattached to restaurants) & clubs are not supposed to reopen until Phase 5, which will be the late fall at the earliest -- when there is a vaccine or an effective therapy for the virus.I would not stay at an Airbnb in Pilsen, as you will need to take public transit or ride-shares to get to & from downtown & River North. Personally, I am avoiding the L and Uber as much as possible. The same generous cancellation policies that you are finding with Airbnb are also available from hotels. Stay at one in River North or the Magnificent Mile so that you can walk to most of your destinations."
Thank you MBA60302! We did end up not booking in Pilsen. Will be in Lakeview so will sill need L and uber but we will probably stay in a lot with friends visiting us rather than us going to them. Easier since they'll have a car and can drive to us. If we go out it'll be with a mask. :-)
FYI - masks are not optional they are required for entry.B.
"There are currently street closures in Lakeview, to expand the room for outdoor dining. Not sure how long that will be lasting. Once indoor dining is permitted (at reduced density), which is likely to occur in early July, I would expect that the expanded outdoor dining space will be eliminated. And, yes, here in Illinois face-masks are not optional. They are the law whenever you are in a situation where you cannot be assured of 6 feet of space from people other than members of your household. Your Uber/Lyftt drivers will expect you to wear one, and they are required on Ls & buses, as well as indoors in any shop or public spaces. From my friends in MD (and pictures of Ocean City that I've seen in the press), I know that many folks in MD are not wearing masks when they should. You will not find that here"
They are also required outside at Navy Pier and the Riverwalk no matter what.
I totally get it. I just meant when we go out I'll wear a mask regardless of if it's mandatory. :-)
I know it's not optional. No problem whatsoever.
