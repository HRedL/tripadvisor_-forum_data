Hi was looking for any information to when Emirates will fly to Dubai again as thought I’d seen somewhere saying July 2020 from uk thanks
I guess the authorities plan to open to tourists around July https://m.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus-pande…
"@ Lisa - have a good read through this thread.The only 'facts' at present are that Emirates filed for slots to fly, then delayed till July. Note that doesn't mean they will fly.If you check the links in the thread you can see when they are planning (or rather, hoping) to start flying on specific routes - and some are far later than July.https:/…106424857"
Thanks Shaun I was booked to go for husbands 40th 24th June but understand won’t b going then when I had read bit about starting flights in July I was thinking I maybe could go 30th July as only time I’m able to travel again this year but who knows guess will have to wait and see what next month brings with all the travel news
You also have to consider whether tourists from the worst affected country In Europe (the UK) will be welcomed into Dubai - just because Emirates are flying doesn’t mean UK tourists will be welcome
Might be best you think in terms of 2021.
I too was wondering as we are booked to go mid August. I guess there are two questions 1) The situation is ever changing and until near the time won’t be confirmed and 2) Would I want to go? My balance is due very soon and I’m not sure if I should pay it or lose my deposit. I’ve read the reviews on the travel providers website with so so many people saying that they are not getting responses with regards to there refunds. It’s a huge balance and wondering if I’m better cutting my loses and losing the deposit.
"i would agree with Latimer ,whether we are welcome back ie they allow people in from the UK, as we are one if not the worst affected countries Hannah also said similar a few days ago. But more interesting so did simon caulder on a interview he did with good morning tv, he didnt mention Dubai but he thought Uk people would only be able to travel in a bubble environment initially ie channel islands , isle of man and Ireland . So i would have no great hopes even if emirates fly we from the uk will be allowed to enter. Oz and NZ have done something similar and created their own bubble of allowed travel. Emirates have unless its changed were allowing rebooking of trips up to the 30th Nov if booked direct so that suggest there schedule will be very limited. Last poster who have you booked with if your looking to lose the deposit, different providers are working differently in terms of customer care and contact. i dont think any one can tell you what to do but id would be considering my decision on who i was booked with and how they are currently treating customers. personally i would be mindful of paying out a large amount of money when the unknown is still very unknown. i honestly dont think we will be entering dubai by august as we are still very much a high rise nation .Edited: 7:40 am, May 02, 2020 "
"Interesting threadWe’re hoping to go in September but I’m not sure if it’s a pipe dream or notA huge part of me thinks that if we’re not somewhere close to normal by then, we’ll have gone to hell in a hand cart anyway"
