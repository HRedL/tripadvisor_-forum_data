"Hong Kong will drastically reduce cross-border travel with mainland China in a bid to contain the spread of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, starting with the shutdown of the two railways and denying entry to individual mainland travellers.Flights from and to the mainland will be cut by half and cross-border tour buses will also be reduced, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced in a press conference as she listed the containment strategy that stopped short of a total shutdown demanded by legislators from across the political spectrum.Beijing has agreed to stop issuing individual travel visas for mainlanders, who account for half of all such mainland arrivals into the city. The measures will be effective midnight Thursday."
"UK FCO advises against travel to Hubei; nothing official about travel to other parts of China. There is a thread on the main China forum about your question. As you will see, the advice ranges from 'lock your doors and shoot all strangers' to 'Come breathe the air and kiss as many strangers as possible!"" (Obviously I excarrate for effect). KI am in a similar position to you. I am due to travel to China end February. As yet, I am undecided about what to do."
"There are folks who feel everything should be shut down, then there are others who feel the government is panicking. You can never please everyone."
Maybe it's a bit of both... can't we simply shut down everything and remain panic-free at the same time?

"If you were traveling this week, it is still pretty safe. But starting this weekend and into the following weekend, the Hong Kong residents who were visiting the Mainland for the Lunar New Year will be returning in much greater numbers. How many of those Hong Kong residents will have the virus? Your guess is good as anyone else. Those who have the virus, will they know they have the virus? No one really knows. If you can cancel without penalty, cancel the trip otherwise you are gambling with something where you don't even know the odds, but the outcome could be worst than just losing some money."

UK foreign office have now advised against all travel to the Hubei province and all non essential travel to mainland China excluding Hong Kong and Macau
"We were due to fly to Hong Kong on 8th, spend a few days sightseeing and then fly on to Bangkok / Phuket. We’ve sadly cancelled the Hong Kong visit and are now flying a few days later to Kuala Lumpur then up to Bangkok (using air miles and that was the only availability). However, our return flight from Bangkok means flying into HK airport then catching a flight to Uk. Not as concerned about this brief stop, although I may buy a couple of masks just to be safe"
"If you can find the masks now. Chinese friends living in USA, Australia and New Zealand are finding zero availability. People are buying and sending to relatives here."
British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China.

"""Well yes - what's the point of flying half-empty planes? That is just a sound business decision based on economics."" - So are you seriously suggesting they couldn't fill a single plane to or from China? That is nonsense. The reporting is clear that the action was taken by BA based upon the UK office advising against all but essential travel to mainland China. The statement from BA specifically says: ""We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority."" This was not a decision based upon economics."

"""You're clearly someone who has never had P&L responsibility for a significant business."" Sorry I didn't know you are in charge of BA airlines. Here I am relying on the actual reasons they cite in their official statements."
"There will still be enough flights between HK and China for those that want to go there, albeit that numbers are being reduced from the current 480 flights a week to ""just"" 240 a week."
Me too! Singapore airlines wont' issue a refund at this stage as travel to HK is ok. But i'm there for 4 days and if nothing's open (i'm not fussed about theme parks) i'm worried i'll be terrible bored is get stranded
"HK Ga Yau, Can you imagine if BA issued a statement stating that due to planes having too many empty seats, they would be cancelling flights?"
">> due to planes having too many empty seats, they would be cancelling flights?In fact I have seen such announcements in the past - routes being dropped due to too few passengers.That was not related to viruses, though."
"""In fact I have seen such announcements in the past - routes being dropped due to too few passengers."" - yea a number of airlines had said specifically they are cutting back due to lower demand."
#28 and #29 - That is not even close to the same thing! Airlines announce permanent cancelling of flight routes due to low demand when they plan on stopping those routes 'permanently' - not for temporary cancellations like what BA is doing right now. These are two very different things.
"""That is not even close to the same thing!"" I didn't say anything about permanent dropping of flights. I thought the comment was about them cutting routes at the current time. I'm just pointing out that some airlines have specifically said they are cutting back on flights due to low demand. I know United Airlines did that. That's not to say they won't restore the route later when it becomes profitable.Edited: 5:46 am, January 30, 2020 "

Also, it's not in the interest of BA (and other airlines) to bring more potential infections into their system. If the virus spreads uncontrollably worldwide, it will have an impact on their entire operation, not just the China routes."

"OP; you really need to make your own decision. Here's a very recent NYT summary, including the WHO declaring a global health emergency. It will be interesting to see how nations react to that.https:/…coronavirus-china.html"
"Latest WHO figures 7818 confirmed cases, 170 deaths, 82 outside China, so about 2% death rate, 1% of cases outside China. https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019"
"I have posted this on a HK thread, but I'm posting here as well - looking for opinions. Would anyone fly through the Hong Kong airport anytime soon without any concerns about being in the airport or, even more concerning, flying in the aircrafts that are being used to haul lots of potentially infected people from Hong Kong to other locations? There are a lot of us out here who haven't had the chance for a refund on our flights in and out of Hong Kong but are wondering if we should consider cancelling our flights....Also, a big concern for me is to be traveling far from hospitals while backpacking across my ultimate destination after leaving HK (somewhere in Borneo)....seems like it might be foolish for me to take that flight...thanks for any opinions on the subject."
"According to one information source there are 12 cases in Hong Kong from current WHO reported China total of 7736, which is about 0.15%. Total cases outside China is currently reported as 82 vs 7818 total global = 1%. Borneo or Indonesia has not reported any cases.It’s theoretically possible to catch flu virus on planes but the 1% of total cases outside China and other reports are not suggesting plane travel is currently a major hazard.If you have any medical issue in remote places of the world with low health care facilities it will always be an issue, a general risk that you should have already known."
"Thanks, that is a good snapshot of ""today"" - I am thinking ahead a few weeks at what might be different. Of course, there is no way to know but one source predicted the peak might occur in April - right about when I'm coming back through the Hong Kong airport to come home. I wonder if there might be more restrictions/quarantines in place at that time. I was thinking I might continue my trip plans if I can change airports - maybe even my destination (not Asia). Just an idea at this point. I still have a few weeks to watch this thing play out."
"The main hazard of plane traffic is that the virus hitches a ride through infected passengers... something that has happened several times already.Still with the number of aircraft the chance that YOU end up on a flight with someone carrying the virus, is very low. And if such an infected person is on the plane, the chance of that person being able to infect you in turn is also very low.All in all, low risk. If you get sick or die on your travels the chance that it is from this particular disease is, again, very low."
"It is peace of mind. I flew from San Francisco to New York yesterday on a business trip. Uber driver coughed a little, I worried a little. A young woman sitting across from me at gate had a running nose, I moved away. Couple next to my wife flew from the Philippines, transited in HK and SFO, husband was in poor shape, no cough but didn’t get up nor spoke, that was also concerning. These are not Chinese passengers.There were also some Asian passengers, where did they come from? I wondered. All Asians had face masks, that is slightly alarming. In my NYC hotel, there are few Asians, I again wondered a bit, they don’t look like China Chinese. But I wouldn’t dare to touch elevator buttons.If you can stay home, stay home. If it is non-essential travel, stay home and relax."

@40 if I had a flight via hong kong for April I wouldn't make a decision yet and wait and see. Some hong kong experts are suggesting there can be a 2000% increase in hong kong cases in the coming weeks. Seems like in the next few weeks we will see if hong kong has taken enough steps to prevent the spread.
"2000% increase sounds a lot until you realise how low the starting number really is (12).The sheer number of patients after that increase should not be a problem for the Hong Kong hospitals - it's the fuss around it that's the problem (shortage of protective equipment; shortage of isolation ward beds, all-around panic, ...).If in a month Hong Kong is really at 250 cases it's still a fraction of the total number of SARS cases it had to deal with."
"Well, I have plans (and paid hotels, air tickets, etc) for my family trip to China mainland and HK next April 4, From Mexico with AirCanada and a few domestic by HK Airlines, now bought companies announced the cancelation of all flights to and from the mainland during January and February: So I'm almost sure by today your flight is canceled or will be in the next few days."
"I seriously hope for you Hong Kong Airlines is still operating by then. They skirted bankruptcy last December... that was before the virus outbreak... and most of their flights are to/from the mainland. They already announced major layoffs just to stay afloat.Hong Kong Airlines flights are not domestic, afaik they have only international flighs."
"Not sure anyone can answer this question, as April is pretty far off and no one,not even health experts, has a handle on what the course of this virus will be. As of today, both the State Dept and The CDC have recommended against travel to mainland China. Things are changing on a daily basis, so keep tabs on what the experts-WHO/CDC, etc-recommend."

I'm not sure about flights coming into HK after Feb. 29 but that date could get pushed out. And I'm not sure about flights departing HK...."
"For those who don’t know why elevator buttons are dangerous, here is the history of elevator button No.9 in HK which started SARS in HK:SARS arrived in Hong Kong in February 2003, when a doctor who had treated some of the cases of SARS at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital in Guangdong came to attend a family gathering. Dr. Liu Jianlun, Hong Kong's index patient, checked into the Metropole Hotel on February 21, with a room on the ninth floor, specifically room 911. Even though he was already feeling somewhat ill he visited with his family and they traveled around Hong Kong. By the morning of February 22, he knew he was very sick and walked over to seek care at nearby Kwong Wah Hospital. He eventually died there in the Intensive Care Unit on March 4. He is believed to have been a super spreader, as he spread the virus to many other guests on his hotel floor. Liu's brother-in-law sought medical treatment in late February, entered the hospital on March 1, and died on March 19. Twenty-three other guests from the Metropole developed SARS, seven of them from the ninth floor, and it is estimated that around 80% of the Hong Kong cases were due to Liu."

"Regarding my post (#55) regarding Cathy Pacific's travel advisory for flights to Hong Kong, see my note below link:https://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/trave…the part that mentions mainland China is a typo! I just got off the phone with them. They will be making the correction (they were already aware of the typo). Here's the deal - you can rebook according to what you see there, just ignore that part about mainland China (it should say Hong Kong). At this time, they don't offer any refunds without a cancellation fee. In my case, I could cancel my flight anytime up to my flight and get back $465 of my $665 because there is a $200 cancellation fee (that's exactly what my terms were when I purchased the ticket). Or I can rebook (always flying through HK) at a later date (until June 30) and have no rebooking fee but still be subject to seat availability on the flight and the difference in tax/airfare."
"#57 any public facility like a lift button, door handle, toilets, being in the droplet sneeze or vomit zone of an immediate infect person of a whole of diseases, common flu etc can theoretically be infection surfaces and have been documented to occur in science history. The practical reality is very different as most bacteria and virus have a rapid die off rate once outside the human body and there are many other randomly environmental and physical factors at play. Therefore it is good to be aware but not greatly alarmed and take precautions if you fear it like use back of knuckles, gloves, trick others to do it for you, elbow or pen to press buttons etc."
"Latest WHO official update is 9826 confirmed global cases, 213 deaths (all inside China), 106 outside of China so the percentages are still the same with 1% outside of China and 2% death rate. The previous WHO update a day before was about 7800 and this latest one is approx 1000 more, 6 days ago the figure was around 2800 cases, now a 3 fold increase in only a week, very rapid. However, keep these numbers in perspective as 650,000 people die yearly globally from normal flu and related complications.The link for latest WHO cases is here for verification https:/…If anyone has issues or different numbers with the above please provide a reliable source link, not merely a media reference unless it is referenced properly."
"11,374 confirmed cases. 213 deaths. John Hopkins report or is that media to you? https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
"Actually the most recent numbers are 11,948 confirmed cases worldwide, including 259 fatalities. This gives a detailed breakdown of the numbers and provides sources for the statistics. Just because this is a media company doesn't mean that their information is somehow faulty. I have followed this website for days and their numbers have always ended up being accurate. Its a reputable media source. https:/…"
"I don’t doubt the JH one university reports but virtually all global government advisories including US CDC are referring to the common offical source WHO figures that are a day old, which they and governments have obligations to ensure consistency and vetting reliability. In any case the numbers are roughly within 10% of each other as would be expected if the JH data is in real time.General media is tending to seize upon the higher quoted real-time numbers for maximum news impact often without source reference.It’s no problem to mention JH numbers if referenced properly so readers know what’s going on, which hasn’t happened before."
"""It’s no problem to mention JH numbers if referenced properly so readers know what’s going on, which hasn’t happened before."" I'm not going to constantly reference stuff because you say so.

"Contagious epidemics usually occur in winter months, not summer. Why? Because bacteria and virus last longer, hours or day or suspended in sir in the dry winter air. Drier air in winter? Google it yourself."
"#65 no body telling you do to anything, nor does it need to be interpreted that that way. With regard to the South China Post media report it references China NHC state media and others and cases in China, Taiwan and Asia, no mention of other countries unless it means no new cases in those areas.#67 I have some health science background and investigate infectious disease as one part of government work so aware of bacteria and virus survivability outside the human body. It varies a lot depending the microbe type and environmental conditions, while the cold may preserve some forms to last longer, the majority die rapidly outside of human body moisture, temperature and sunlight exposure. For Flu virus that are so tiny are highly adapted to being carried on sneeze droplets to be breathed in and infect others plus surface contact. The warmer tropical zones of the world on average carry more diseases than cooler climates as it suits biological microbe activity more so. It’s kinda similar to why refrigerating food helps vs not doing so."
"""With regard to the South China Post media report it references China NHC state media and others and cases in China, Taiwan and Asia"" - The article specifically says: ""According to the National Health Commission in Beijing"" and then it gives the numbers for China.

@75 your absolute best source of info is your airline..and probably closer to travel....airlines are making decisions day by day...week by week.....no one knows what the situation in HK will be in March.
The Vietnam decision was so sudden that a plane from Vietnam to HK was told to turn around and head back shortly before it was due to land in HK... and the next day after all flew its passengers to HK. Chaos.Many flights are being cancelled as well. So indeed - ask your airline for the latest status.
"So Far - Cathay is a go to Hong Kong; their site says fees will be waived for rebook or reroute (conditions apply) . Slated to arrive HK on 2/27, embarking on 14 day Asia cruise 2/29.

Travel agent is pitching full credit to go elsewhere with the same line, but must be within 30 days of current embarkation date - not too many choices for same $$ but one or two of interest for, you guessed it, more $$.

There is a long standing thread - Is HK Safe to Travel that was mostly about protest related matters for many months. Now it is regularly updated in regard to Coronavirus matters locally. I'd advise reading posts there as well as to some of the newly asked questions near the top of the Hong Kong forum (page 1). https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29421…"
"It would be ridiculous to stay at a hotel for two days. While most folks are wearing masks, they are still going to work. Fewer people are patronizing restaurants and shops. Nobody is panicking."
">> Nobody is panicking.That's just how you define ""panicking"" - stocking up on food, lining up for hours hoping to get masks, shops putting up notices that you can only enter wearing a mask... I call that forms of panic behaviour."
"There is indeed ""panic"" behavior to secure masks. At this point, mask = freedom to walk outside your home. People still go to work otherwise. There is one person in my office who doesn't want to eat out at all and that's it. Everyone else still goes out to eat. I was at Maxim's Palace this past Sunday and they still managed a full house for dim sum though without any queues.The stockpiling behavior is ludicrous, especially for food. Food has never been unavailable. CNY combined with the extended work stopping right afterwards contributed to some of the shelves being empty. I know a logistics manager at Vitasoy who said they lacked drivers since many of them had to self-quarantine after the holidays. My colleague's friend works at the government and said a lot of merchandise is stuck at ports due to the extended holidays. Shops (not doctors) that require masks to enter should just close. I walked by a wedding dress shop the other day where they put out a sign saying patrons must use masks, take off their shoes, and step on the disinfecting rug before entering. That's way over the top.At the end of the day, a visitor won't be affected much by such behavior whether the locals are panicking. Obviously, a visitor should still weigh the risks and practice good hygiene habits regardless.Edited: 2:06 am, February 04, 2020 "

"Indeed.As I write this I'm on a very empty train from Mongkok back to Tai Po. Had to pick up something, had lunch, all without mask. No spreading in HK so it's completely useless.During SARS the same, though a major difference is that this disease is confirmed to be able to spread through the air.It was rather quiet in Mongkok. Not sure if that's due to absence of locals much. Almost no tourists in sight. Also unusually few helpers on the big footbridge today."

"Many thanks everyone. Will refer to the appropriate forum and hoping to go forward with current plans. Our prayers for a timely and thorough remedy to the virus situation (ranjo364)Edited: 11:43 am, February 04, 2020 "
"Backtracking a bit and eating my own words, a somewhat fairer assessment is maybe HGY and I aren't panicking but surely, many others are. Several thousand lined up overnight to buy masks last night. At Tsim Sha Tsui, people were lining up for them even before the exact shops with stock were revealed. A housewife friend of mine bought 10 large bags of rice today. Her friends who go to work simply have no time to fight the other housewives and grandmas who line up at the supermarket. They empty the delivery truck before the goods even hit the shelves.It will be interesting to see whether some hotels and restaurants could remain open if the mask shortage continues. I know a person who works at the same group company of one of the two major chain pharmacies in the city. Even they have problems procuring masks for their office. She also noted that a major 5* hotel group and several restaurant groups are looking for masks. I even saw a TDC text message looking for 800,000 masks for the upcoming trade fair season.Again, virus risk and attractions closure aside, such panicking behavior does not impact the casual visitor normally."
"The latest panic buy is toilet paper - after online rumours it would be in short supply. Of course that's already become a self-fulfilling prophecy by now, with shelves emptied of the commodity. The problem is that we're also running low, it was just not time for me to buy another pack, but will have to do asap now...Restaurants shouldn't be affected too much by lack of masks, after all you can't wear one while eating. Though if the SARS period is anything to go by we'll see some serious casualties amongst the hot pot restaurants.I don't see the point of buying 10 bags or rice - I normally buy one 8 kg bag every month or so. 10 bags that'd be a full year supply!"
"Fight of the day: toilet papershttps://www.facebook.com/watch/…Toilet papers are out of stock along with rice, noddles, canned goods.Supermarkets do restock them but usually are gone in minutes."
"LOL I'd turn that around: it's largely the lack of trust in the existing government to secure supplies as they kinda but not really closed the border that causes these reactions.After all, Carrie Lam has *again* shown us how very much NOT a leader she is."
Beijing is obviously in charge so no use expecting any HK leader whether Carrie or another one to be.
I know. The consequences of which have been getting very obvious over the past 7-8 months... Nonetheless the utter incompetence of Lam in this field is not helping.
"I have spoken to staff at some restaurants. They said they will have to close if they run out of supply. At present, many patrons aren't comfortable with staff not wearing masks. Of course, any potential closure is only on a case-by-case basis. It depends on the individual establishment.>>>Restaurants shouldn't be affected too much by lack of masks, after all you can't wear one while eating.The toilet paper panic shows the gullibility of the masses. Unfortunately, even for people who aren't panicking, we have to go and stock up.There are many supporters of 100% free speech. On the other hand, sometimes you wish there is a law that penalizes fake news."
"I know, I also feel the need to start stocking up on food and so as much as I hate doing so. But it's just as everyone else is trying to stock up, and I don't want to risk being left out, unable to find enough food, or unable to wipe my ass after taking a dump.Yesterday the wet markets were still well stocked, though."
