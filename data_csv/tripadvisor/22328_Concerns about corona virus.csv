We are scheduled to go to Provo at the beginning of April for one week. Does anyone else have concerns about the impact of the corona virus on travel to TCI? We are flying out of JFK. Obviously anything can happen in a month. Any thoughts?
"My thought you have a bigger chance of bringing it with you, same chance as flu, and other ailments. Wash your hands, bring wipes for everything, will minimize your chances (The things CDC has been saying). So far code zero, you have a bigger chance of getting it in New York, yet chances are still slim)Good luck!Edited: 4:40 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Thanks, Blamona. It's that darn JFK Airport that has me more concerned than anything. I appreciate your response."
"On the thought of ""bringing it with you "". Is that fair to the local community. I'm struggling with the same thing. Don't know if I'm being selfish or doing the right thing by traveling at this time."
"<< ""Is that fair to the local community."" >>If you've not been in close contact with someone who has coronavirus your chances of ""bringing it with you"" are negligible. Caution is one thing. But is it possible that over-reacting -- and not going -- is potentially just as unfair to the local community?"
"I don't think it is selfish at all. If I am healthy and able to travel from my area, why wouldn't I go! I handled the situation that would have caused me stress worrying about it."
"We just came back Saturday and flew to and from JFK. Wash your hands and sanitize your tray, seat belt and all on plane."
That's all great but how would you know if you had been in contact with a positive person. Some carry the disease with no symptoms but are infectious. I personally have concerns about bringing this disease to a zero infection community. So some of you feel differently and that's fine . Or want to paint this as a foolish concern. While I consider that not giving that some thought to be selfish .
"<< ""I personally have concerns about bringing this disease to a zero infection community."" >>So, obviously you're not leaving your house until the coronavirus is no more. Right?Or are you only concerned about bringing coronavirus to T&C?"
Why does this bother you. What I feel. You do you and I'll do me. OK with you?

"I think this whole thing is complicated. You want to live your life as if nothing is wrong. And, certainly, no one would travel nonchalantly if they were sick with the virus. We also rented an expensive villa this time, and I'm worried about losing the money. Anyone know about cancellations for reasons like this?"
"Did you get insurance (cancel for any reason) or does your credit card you use offer insurance?The way the island is treating it is holding to their cancelation policy. Currently at zero with no one Ill, planes are flying as always (and full). No one returns money based on a fear. (I fear flying! But don’t see getting money back for that)"
"nepatriot, my thoughts on this are that it would more likely come from a cruise ship visiting GT and then going over to Provo. I live in NY but not NYC. I am on the other side of the state and not flying into JFK. I am in the health care field but I work from home. I am being kept very informed by them. I am not travelling until May so a lot can change. I am relying on my airline and my own health to determine if I travel."

"We have just been for one week on Grand Turk. Cruise ship passengers live in their world (visiting the beach within the cruise center, little organised tours, staying together). Our stay on Grand Turk was like a luxury quarantine.We are now for a week on Grace Bay Provo. Everything looks fine, so far no case.My opinion: If you do not have symptoms, no contacts to corona known it is a good time to visit Turks and Caicos Islands"
"We fly out of JFK on Friday for Provo and I'm not worried at all about the corona virus. I'm more worried about the flu and the Norovirus but I'm not really worried about them either. There's the difference between possibility and probability to be aware of. Where it is possible that I will contract the corona virus, the probability is very very low.See you Friday Grace Bay!"
"Kimberly, I actually am not worried even if I did get it because I am not in a high risk category for it and neither is my husband. I was more worried about the hysteria surrounding it and how that could affect my air travel."
This may have already been shared. If not here it is. The USA currently has a level 1 for risk of the corona virus. It is probably the best source of information rather than on a forum. https:/…index.html
I follow the Turks and Caicos Tourism facebook page and they posted that they are not allowing flights from countries with outbreaks. At this time I don't think the US is considered as having the outbreak but I would imagine in the near future that could happen. Following for my trip coming up the first week of May.
The US state department has issued a Global Level 3 Health Advisory – Reconsider Travel. https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…We are supposed to leave for our trip to Provo two weeks from today. Things are changing overnight and in a matter of days T&C may not let flights in and/or the US (and other countries) may ban flights out so we should pay close attention.
Following as well. Our trip is for mid April. A lot can change between now and then. Trying to stay updated and informed.
Thank you Kerry45 for your info which directs you to the Smart Traveler site where you can create an account and enter your travel times and destinations. At this point the only advisory for TCI is from Feb. regarding crime so I hope we will have no problems for our departure this Sunday!
"We have decided to cancel our trip from April 4-11. I am heartbroken, but we are not spring chickens and also the travel restrictions just seem to be increasing.TCVillas has been wonderful and helpful without cancellation. We will be back for 3 weeks during Christmas.Of course, this is just our personal decision, and we wish everyone a wonderful trip.Edited: 1:44 pm, March 12, 2020 "
I meant to say the have been wonderful with our cancellation.
"Tropicalbird, Were you able to just switch dates? We rented through TC Villas and are going to try and go later in the year with the hopes things have calmed down. We purchased insurance but since we aren't cancelling wasn't sure what route to go. Thanks for any advice!Edited: 2:46 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"if you purchased insurance, go that route then everyone is wide openBUT is it cancel for any reason?I ask because if not, TCI is code zero, most insurances won't pay for ""just in case """
I was just curious what that specific company did. We don't want money back so I wasn't sure if the insurance hassle was needed. We just want to change dates.
"KelseyW changing dates is like a refund, they couldn't rent out yours at short notice, and now you'll block the calendar for future potential money they could make just renting the dates outSo if you bought insurance, using it is the right thing to do!"
"We are due to travel April too and considering cancellation I’m a health care worker and work privately too and concerned about both returning back to Canada with virus or even travelling there and taking with me, just never know!!! Very difficult but would just move y vacation to next April, disappointing but safety first."
Totally agree with fhis
"We also cancelled our upcoming trip in a couple of weeks. We never buy trip insurance. No issues with our airline (WestJet), money just goes to a travel bank to be used within a year. Fast Track is crediting my cc and the deposit for our stay GT will now be put towards our next booking in November.I would hope that most resorts and villa owners will work with their customers.Was looking forward to it, but with health issues it’s not worth chancing it.Edited: 5:54 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Since we are going back for Christmas, TCVillas will apply our refund to our new rental. The only snag is the owners of our current rental are not the same owners as our Christmas rental, so I hope there is no problem. I spoke with TCVillas today, and it seems like they are working hard to accommodate the situation, although we haven't heard the final word from them yet. We did not have insurance.Jet Blue is issuing a credit that requires you to book within one year even though you can travel later than the one year date. You just have to book within the year."
"Will be there in a few weeks God willing unless there is a drastic change in conditions or a travel restriction.Edited: 6:47 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"We are scheduled for arrival on 4/4 and we are kicking around rescheduling to later dates. Like Tropicalbird, we are not spring chickens either with both my wife and I in our 60's. Our villa owner will allow us to change our dates to a year out, now just trying to see what Jet Blue will do. Their website says if cancelled money is put in a travel bank to be used within 1 year of ticket issuance, which was January 19. I'd like to, if we choose to do so, move the dates out to next April as the villa owners vacation for the months of October and November so those months are out. We'll see how it all plays out.Edited: 7:16 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Keater04, Jet Blue said that as long as you BOOK within the year, you don't have to fly out within the year. The year expiration date is only for booking, not travelling."
Thank you! It’s comforting to know they are easy to work with during this. We truly don’t want to miss this vacation. Things seemed to escalate where we live so we are hoping to know more in the coming days.
keater one year from your ticket issuance could actually be that you would be required to book travel by then. Not actually take a trip by then. I found that out with a Delta flight I was credited.
"Keater, I know it’s a different airline, but was told by West Jet that we had to BOOK within the year, but NOT have to travel within the year. Only for us it was a year from cancellation.."
"Thanks all I appreciate the clarification. I'm trying to call Jet Blue but wait times have been extensive. If it's booking within a year, that would not be an issue as we'd rebook as soon as April of 21 flights came out."
I just read that there are two people in quarantine on turks and a possible 5 others. This was on the TCI weekly news. Has anyone else seen this?
They are being proactive and monitoring. Nothing confirmed at this time.Could be anyone with a cold and a cough.
"Currently in Provo - had no problems traveling here, but arrived on a Saturday and customs took 2 hours. Most I’ve ever had it take in the past was 45 minutes. You get a questionnaire about the virus-no other screening. A local said there are 6 people on the island who are quarantined, but no positive tests here yet."
"The TC government site informs of 6 in quarantine 2 awaiting test results, saw this late last night"
Have they stopped flights from coming in from certain areas? Like Italy etc?
Where can I find this page???
Ministry of health Turks Update Mar 11thThey are awaiting the test results. I just decided not to travel first because I’m a health cate worker and had booked 2 weeks for April so if things get worse don’t want to get stuck (I work privately with 6 regular clients) and also would not want to risk carrying anything to Turns if they don’t confirm cases there. Tough decisions for us all.
We are scheduled to arrive from Toronto on March 23. Playing it by ear for now and not sure what to do.
"We are scheduled to arrive on the 23rd as well, flying out of JFK. We are in our 60's and have pretty much avoided contact with the outside world for this past week. The only thing that will stop us is if they shut down the airlines (Delta). Hoping that won't happen, we love our TCI vacation."
Thank you. We're definitely going as long as the flights are flying!
We're leaving in the a.m. as planned!
I am so torn on what to do! My husband still wants to go as do I but I just want to be smart about it. We are in our 30's and luckily very healthy. My concerns are IF we would to pass it to someone unknowingly and if we do get sick and we are not home. Plus we will have our daughter with us (3 yrs). We are supposed to leave in two weeks. We will continue to monitor but hoping to make a decision in a few days.
"Bravo! I look at it this way - there doesn't seem to be any cure for it at this point and if I'm gonna die from Covid-19, it might as well be in paradise! Besides, there have been numerous positive cases near me in NY and I want to get the hell out of here! I have been avoiding people and places for 2 weeks so I stay healthy for the trip!"
I am suppose to leave on 3/21. My concern is if there is a outbreak on the island not being able to get back into the US or facing a mandatory 14 day quarantine. So upset with this happening. I am holding off cancelling as long as I can hoping for a miracle
"We cancelled...the Canadian government is advising all Canadians to stop international travel. Some provinces are putting into place a mandatory 14 day quarantine when returning to Canada. This is getting very serious now as schools, tourist attractions and events are being cancelled to try and stop the spread here. I did not want to cancel but I think it is the appropriate things to do at this point until the virus is less of a threat."
"Not fer nuthin, but if you can afford Turks & Caicos to begin with, I can't think of anyplace else I'd rather be quarantined if required! There are no confirmed cases as of today, while there are many cases here in NY. Get me outta here!"
Not if you heard about their quarantine facility.
"As tewks stated the quarantine facility is not very impressive, it's the old hospital in Blue Hills which has been abandoned for years. Additionally the current hospital has no where the facilities to treat if you're infected while on island. Even if you have medevac insurance they would probably have issues treating you prior to you being flown off island. This is one of the primary reasons we decided to cancel our trip, it was the right decision for us.Edited: 1:53 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"<< "" I can't think of anyplace else I'd rather be quarantined if required!"" >>You won't be quarantined at Amanyara, The Somerset, or Grace Bay Club."
Rhode Island just imposed a 14 day self quarantine when returning from ANY foreign country. Governor will be signing an executive order. Now I have to sadly cancel. Who knows what shoe will fall next. :(
"<< ""Rhode Island just imposed a 14 day self quarantine"" >>Source/Link please.NVRMNDhttps://www.golocalprov.com/news/breaking-ra…Edited: 2:42 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"In Rhode Island, other steps announced Friday include a ban on visits to nursing homes and an executive order requiring that anyone who has traveled internationally must self-quarantine for 14 days after returning from abroad. The governor has already signed emergency regulations expanding eligibility for unemployment and other benefits.https:/…"
"Happy to see that some of you have searched your souls and decided against traveling. It's the right thing to do at this time. Take one for the team.Those of you still traveling, if they let you. Please reconsider what you are doing. TCI will still be there when this is all over. Sure you may be young and healthy but you could potentially pass the virus to someone who isn't. You don't want to live with that. Or maybe you can. I couldn't. South Korea's government is testing 10,000 a day. The US government is testing apx 200 a day. Something is wrong here."
Just returned from TC Sunday the 8th I was sent home from the Healthcare facility where I work today and need to self quarantine until the 23rd because I traveled outside of the US Check with your employer. Restrictions are changing rapidly
"We just returned yesterday, and were there while all heck was breaking loose in the US. That being said, now that I have seen the island first hand - it is gorgeous but NOT where I'd want to be if I was in need of healthcare. People can carry a virus without knowing and a virus could decimate that tiny island. My perspective of the situation and how it pertains to TCI changed after seeing the island firsthand."
"We just got back from the island on monday night and i am glad we are home. I feel like we got home at just the right time before everything got worse. I would cancel my trip if i was someone going in the next few weeks(or longer). You dont want to be stuck on the island. As much as hubby and i joked about it and said we wish we could be, you really would not want to be there as you would not be quarantined to your fancy resort. Also you dont want to bring something unknowingly to the people in turks. Or bring the virus home from the airplane or wherever and infect the elderly or people with conditions who cant fight it. It feels much better to be home when these kinds of scary things are happening. Just my opinion. Sorry to all of you in this position :("
"Take one for the team? Wow. What sanctimonious nonsense. We look forward to our time in TCI all year. As of today, there are no confirmed cases in TCI. I guess what I meant about being quarantined in TCI was not being sick, but being unable to return to JFK. Frankly, I doubt NY will shut down the airports. They haven't even shut down all of the schools! And the Governor of RI can't enforce a 14 day ""self-quarantine"" after international travel unless he's prepared to administer tests to every international traveller and give them the results at the airport in 3 hours. If someone tests positive then he'd have grounds for mandatory quarantine.Edited: 11:24 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Liza, you really should research where you’ll end up if you have to be quarantined. Not nice. Something to consider.Edited: 11:52 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Lisa, the governor of RI is a SHE"
"Don't you mean the Gov. of RI identifies as a female? LOL, why the heck would I care what gender the Gov. is regarding voluntary self-quarantine regulations? I still have 9 days before our flight. I will be watching this on a day by day basis. If, as of 3/20, the flights are flying and there are no confirmed cases in TCI, paradise here we come. In 2009, 12,500+ people died from H1N1. I do NOT recall any mass closures, people with masks, urging for testing, quarantines or panic buying. This is mostly political. They couldn't get Trump with Russia or impeachment so they'll do it with a virus. This fearmongering vis irrational."
Ahhh.. this explains everything. Please don’t get your news about this virus from Fox. It’s not political. Get your head out of the sand.
"You can't possibly be serious. What if YOU unknowingly have the virus and you take it down there. You infect a ton of people. Then you and your privilege get to fly home to the US, while all of the poor TCI folks get to duke it out to see who gets one of the couple dozen hospital beds. That country and the population there are unable to handle the consequences of a pandemic and the population could get wiped out quickly."
"You're really serious? You think NY is more equipped to ""handle"" this? I have been washing my hands until my skin is like sandpaper. I use Lysol wipes on my grocery cart and even switched to Amazon Fresh home delivery on the 10th. I teleconferenced with my doctor to get my prescription refills so I wouldn't have to go into the office and I wear a mask and bring Lysol wipes with me if I have to run a local errand. Just stop your nonsense. It's not like it's the bubonic plague for goodness sake."
"I respect and listen to Dr. Fauci, he seems pretty spot on. He appears on every channel though .... oops."
We have made the tough decision to postpone our trip. Our accommodations were very flexible with us which was so helpful. May everyone stay healthy!
Lisa there is no question that the USA is more equipped to handle a pandemic than TCI. It's odd that you're taking all these health safety measures at home yet you think the virus is a conspiracy to take down Trump.

Alrighty then!
"Politics aside, this virus is no joke and should be taken very seriously. We also made the tough decision to cancel our first trip to TCI, however we will be rescheduling for next year. Both hotel and jetblue were accommodating with credits for future use (for those with jetblue, unless you used points for your flights, it literally takes 1 minute, just 3 clicks to cancel, no fees, and you have 1 year to rebook. For those that used points, you can do chat, took me about 20 minutes, but heard over the phone is a lot longer). Our family is disappointed to cancel but we can always reschedule, stay healthy everyone wherever you are!"
how didtravel go? we are scheduled for monday and heard arrivals in turks was insane and crazy!
I agree with most people here. Cancelling is the right thing at this time. Short term pain hopefully. I know it is hard during high season for the island to lose valuable tourist dollars however the risk of a serious outbreak on any island would be extremely difficult for everyone. Most people here in Toronto have cancelled travel plans and are staying put. We are all hoping it is short term pain/inconvenience to stop the spread.

I have decided that if things do not improve when I am supposed to travel in mid May that I will have to cancel. I am not that worried about the virus as some are but the conditions that are going on throughout the world don't seem like it would be wise for me to travel if they don't improve. I will just see if I can book for next year.
"I work in a tourism based industry and I am telling you to stay home. You feel safe because we have zero confirmed cases? Easy to stay virus free when we have zero ability to test for it here. Tests are being sent off and have a week wait time for results. So far they have sent off two. The number of people in quarantine is up to 13 now. The quarantine site is the old AIDS Clinic in Blue Hills. Last time I saw it, I think it had two beds.We have no ability to treat COVID-19. We have a twenty bed hospital. I think we have two ventilators on island and who knows if they are even working. When it gets here, it will be almost impossible to stop. We have a large population of illegals working across many sectors who will not seek medical help; they also will not self quarantine. They will continue to work. The virus will spread unchecked in those communities.Choosing to travel here at this time is nothing short of foolish. You are putting both your families and us at unnecessary risk. You at least have the luxury of returning home to a good, if expensive, medical system."
"Sheepmom,LOL! Did you just toss a bucketful of ad hominems at me? So silly. I should flag your hateful post, but that's what your side does. I believe in free speech and allowing people like you to make a jerk of yourself in front of the whole world.I can't wait to get to TCI and away from the panicked blue meanies here in NY.

"Mama Osa,If you work in a tourism based industry in TCI, you are doing your country no favor by trying to drive away millions in tourist dollars. Wash your hands and eat healthy. Disinfect surface areas that other people touch. It's not that difficult. I read they are screening arrivals at the airport. And I'll let you in on a little secret ... NY is only testing people with a fever over 100.4 F. No one can get a corona test yet without symptoms. Again, it's not the bubonic plague and the average age of the U.S. deaths is 82."
"She is doing her country a favor by telling people to not visit so someone who is infected, with no symptoms doesn't come in and infect others. It sounds pretty logical to me."
The average age is 82. Well then no worries. Rock on.
"Mama Osa, Thank you for your heartfelt explanation of what the dangers could be to TCI. I appreciate your post."

Personally, I think announcing that you are cancelling is a bit odd. It is your personal choice, of course, and one I would never want to see denied. I'm not saying you did it, but there are certain people on here who are shaming and name-calling those of us who still plan to vacation in Provo soon, very soon.

"Just want to provide a slight update for any/all of you. I am scheduled to arrive at PLS Wednesday afternoon and as you can imagine, have become increasingly anxious about all of this. As a younger couple, after reading this whole thread my main concern was becoming quarantined there for some reason.After trying to call the hotline over the past few days with no success, I sat here thinking there was no way they’d pick up. Apparently the fact that everyone else probably thinks the same thing, I had some success. The woman I spoke with said that as long as we arrive healthy and pass the airport screening and don’t become really sick while we are there, there isn’t really any risk of becoming “stuck” there. She confirmed my question that the worst case may be getting sent home early.I also asked what the airport screening process was and it’s just a temperature check and a quick interview. It seems they just ask where you’re coming from and where you’ve been recently to prevent the ignorant travelers from getting in and breaking their current ban from certain infected regions of the world.Anyway hope this info helps settle a few nerves like it did mine."
xjohnx I can understand your being anxious about this. I am not traveling until mid May but find it frustrating to not know whether I will be able to travel or not. Thank you for sharing this information. It is helpful to know. I did call my airline this morning and got through right away and the woman on the other end took the time to talk to me not as a employee to a customer but person to person. I was reassured that it looked good that things will settle down. We now have three in our area (Buffalo) all young 20's -30's. They are at home and self quarantined. All had traveled to infected areas. They say that the virus is very contagious but usually mild in symptoms for normally healthy individuals.

"I'm not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV, but I fear what would happen IF this virus were unleashed on any of the TCislands. We love this island and its people. Right now, we believe that the best thing to do is to stay away until this thing is under control and/or there is a vaccine. Yes, it's going to be painful financially and once we get back on-island, we all need to spend, spend, spend! I wish this weren't happening, but wishing isn't going to make this thing go away.For anyone who doubts how serious this is, if the school closures, city quarantines, bar/restaurant/NCAA/NBA/Disney closings are not enough evidence, please read what a Doctor from Italy has to say.

"I'm going to try to be the voice of reason re #91 which states: ""No one can get a corona test yet without symptoms. Again, it's not the bubonic plague and the average age of the U.S. deaths is 82.""1) The very fact that NYS and the US does not have enough tests, negates the argument that the average age of death is 82. People have been dying in the US, but since there were no tests, their deaths were not CoronaVirus confirmed or counted in the number of deaths and/or average age at death. 2) It actually -- is -- JUST like Bubonic Plague/Black Death. COVID 19/ Corona Virus IS also a Pandemic https://www.businessinsider.com/pandemics-th… 3) Contrary to what has been stated, the US President DID call the Corona Virus a HOAX, he claimed No lives had been lost and the US only had 15 cases in the US (again, b/c there was no testing) . Here is a video, in his own words: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YtV-dTSs7I It is clear today that the virus and it's devastating effects are very real. Wait to see what the Stock Market does tomorrow, and interest rates in the US are zero... there is very little the US Gov't can do now to stimulate the economy.This is not a Red State vs Blue State issue. This is a Life vs. Death issue. The TCI should keep its people as insulated as possible for the next 2-3 months and, hopefully, the UK gov't will offer an interest free loan to the TCI Government that can be used to help the residents. The island Does Not have the infrastructure necessary to handle a pandemic.Stay safe all... our prayers are with you and we hope to return ASAP!"

"My wife is a physician at the largest hospital in N.C. We were all set to fly to Grace Bay @ end of March(26th). She spoke w/ the head of infectious disease doc this a.m. He advised to please cancel & not travel at this time. There's nothing fake about this thing. Really stinks, but we'll reschedule for May."
What a hot mess this all has become. Stay safe and do the right thing for everyone's sake.
"Cancelled our trip from Boston 3/28 - 4/4. Would have been our 4th annual trip to Provo. Really bummed, but it is what it is at this point. We will plan another once this all calms down. Take care everyone."
"Reading this thread has brought me to the conclusion that we are all screwed. For every ten people who act responsibly, there will be one who refuses to accept facts and believes they can do whatever they want. We were scheduled to go to Provo from 4/4-4/11 and we have cancelled. Although we are disappointed, I believe that was the responsible thing to do, both for ourselves and for the inhabitants of Turks & Caicos."

Did you listen to the President and Vice-President this afternoon? It's not a media conspiracy. This is real. Amazing there are so many in denial.
"JimLaker,They just ORDERED San Francisco to ""shelter in place"" for 3 weeks! 24 hour curfew! Can you imagine? This is out of control and it's coastal cities running amok. Total panic response. What about all of the homeless people living in squalor? SF did a rotten job picking up the poo and needles before, who's going to do it now? We may have to thank SF for an actual outbreak of bubonic plague in 2020!"
"#160 "" I just don't see it...right now.""This is the type of thinking that WILL get people killed. Did you review what happened in China and Italy? In Italy today, doctors are deciding who lives and who dies because there is not enough medical equipment to save everyone.A 21 year old popular soccer coach in Spain, was diagnosed with CoronaVirus, at the same time he was told he had leukemia and then he suddenly died.This virus is much more deadly than the Flu. And even some people who are surviving now have permanent damage to their lungs and hearts. New Jersey's first patient, a relatively young, relatively healthy EMT/PA has been hospitalized since March 2 but is not improving.By the time you ""see"" the effects, thousands and thousands of people could be dead. No one wants the Stock Market to tank, for planes to stop flying, for borders to close. This is Not a conspiracy, of the media or anyone else. This is a Global Health Crisis. A Pandemic. Social distancing has worked to slow the spread elsewhere. We should all be sacrificing some comfort to save the life and health of others.To get back specifically to the TCI. The TCI does not have the resources and infrastructure to handle an outbreak. The resorts, homes, condos and sea will be there when it's safe to return. Sadly, some restaurants and/or shops may not survive, but going to those stores and restaurants now is not the answer. If you really want to help, buy a Gift Certificate; but congregating in groups right now puts us all at risk.Good luck and travel safe!"
"Anyone else looking forward to May 23. I know I am. Jim you gave some great advice in #132, it might be time to follow it."

JimLaker and Dagney>>>> who would have thought ?
"RE: 169: Happy to share facts and to educate about risk. Facts aren't scary, ignorance is.1) The death rate of the Corona Virus is highest for people 80 and older, statistics right now worldwide show a death rate of ~15%. Fifteen Percent for that age bracket. Total flu death rate is ~.1% and Corona Virus is ~2 %- 3%. That's one tenth of one percent Flu vs 2-3% CV and no vaccine.2) The reason the Flu has killed more people is because the Flu has been circulating for years. This virus first appeared in late 2019. Give it 50 years and post again.3) Italy has the problems they have because Italians looked at China and Wuhan and said ""we don't have to worry, that's China"". Americans did the same thing, frankly. If Americans continue to act as nonchalantly as Italians, it will kill us too -- but the US is much larger than Italy and we have a culture of ""Let the Man stop me"" ""I'm an adult and can do as I please"". During this particular pandemic, that type of thinking and behavior can kill your parent, your neighbor, your parents neighbor and grandparents in your neighborhood.4) Think about this for a minute: China quarantined ~16 million people and shuttered industry, Italy closed all borders and stopped trade -- no cafe, museums, restaurants, France just did the same thing, the US has basically closed it's borders and communities throughout the country are closing schools and businesses.... you think they are ALL WRONG, and you JIM are RIGHT? Or do you think there are facts you are missing or something you don't understand or don't want to believe?Hope this helps and... as always travel safe! PS: since I was paying attention to China 6 weeks ago, I have plenty of paper and other supplies, including wine, but thanks for reminding others who may need to prepare for a 2-3 week quarantine to mandate Social Distancing since stubborn people think they know better and won't behave responsibly. Cheers!"

"Dagny,I'm sorry you don't understand the chronological sequence of the viral invasion of Italy, lack of sovereign borders and a country with universal healthcare that's deciding whether to even give medical care to its 80 year old citizens. But keep stirring the panic if it makes you feel better. Just don't get mad at those of us who don't buy into Chinese propaganda.Edited: 11:26 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Wow. I’ve been quiet on this forum for awhile, but from reading this thread, I feel the need to contribute. As one who is embarking on homeschooling my 3 boys, while they are isolated from friends, sports, and outside activities for the foreseeable future, I’m saddened by some of these comments. I feel like my 9-year-old has more sense and understanding on how to flatten the curve and why it’s so important that we all sacrifice to protect others for the greater good. And as someone with family members who are at high risk, it angers me that people are so cavalier about this virus. One can always rebook a vacation, but you can’t revive a dead person."

"RJP-NJAre you one of our fine men or women in blue? Joisey's a tough state! If yes, thank you for being on the front line and have a donut.I just postponed Provo Ponies, the ferry to N. Caicos, our rental cars, hotel, and I am trying to postpone Delta but can't get through. I'm very sad, RJP. This is a lousy St. Patrick's Day. :-("
Lisa M check on Delta’s website you may not need to talk to them if they are offering free cancellation at this time.
"<< ""Are you one of our fine men or women in blue?"" >>Um, no."

"RJP-NJ and Jim Laker,""You mock my pain!"" ~Princess Buttercup"
"Currently in Provo. Resorts and town are deserted.Some shops are closed and some restaurants are open irregular days and hours.Government has banned all cruise ships for a month, schools are closed for a month, and government activities are cancelled including the weekly fish fry,As of Mon 3:16 they had 1 suspected case and 12 people without symptoms quarantined (I have heard they are using an old hospital or an old prison.) They are currently unable to run tests on the island.2 different locals told us they wished that visitors WOULD NOT COME! They said they would rather take the economic hit than have the disease on the island. One told me the island can not medically handle the disease. They only have a few hospital beds but NO ICU beds and NO ventilators."
"travel gourmet-style,So I'm going to ask the rather obvious question- why didn't TCI government get test kits from WHO? TCI is a 3rd world country. Of course it should have followed the S. Korea model. If they had, they wouldn't have a ""suspected case"", they could be identifying positive and negative."
They have sent the sample off to the Bahamas and are awaiting results.
"So which is it? They have test kits and need to send the swabs off island for results? That's fine. Set up a drive thru test area in the IGA parking lot and test everyone who feel they want one. Send them off. You'll have a good read in 3-4 days of the infection level on the islands and create a baseline. How difficult is this?Edited: 3:35 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"#194 You may have visited a handful of times, but your postings on this island and this issue demonstrate that you have very little knowledge of how the island actually works and what they are capable of.Major US Cities with very sophisticated physical infrastructure and numerous expertly trained medical staff can not yet and have not yet set up drive-thru test sites. The test are extremely invasive with probes deep in the nasal cavity and far down the throat. This often leads people to expel fluids during the test. The Personal Protective Equipment necessary to perform these test on a scale of multiples, I'd imagine, is just Not available in the TCI (even if Kits were available which I doubt they are) and I know they do not have the number of medical staff necessary for testing and treatment on any large scale.It seems you are still learning about this virus. I suggest you continue your studies of this virus and the TCI and I think you will then be able to answer some of your own questions moving forward.Anyone who knows and loves these Islands, knows that the locals are right, and staying away in the short term is the best ting to do to ensure the long term health of the island and its residents."
"The Turks & Caicos is utilising the resources of the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) laboratory for testing of any suspected cases. The Government is looking at procuring ‘quick tests kits’ and the PCR machines to conduct testing for COVID-19 on Island. To my knowledge this has not yet happened. PAHO has sent test kits to the Bahamas but not here yet.We can't set up drive through testing sites, and where are we supposed to send our persons off too?"
"Wow Lisa M. Your comments are astounding. You truly have no understanding of how islands like TCI work and your comments are insulting to say the least. ""How difficult is this?"" Please just stop posting on this forum. Many of us love the people and the island. Many large countries around the world are struggling to deal with this virus that have access to way more resources and money. Please stop. God bless TCI and all who call it home."
Is anyone else having deja vu? Another gas-lighter just trying to get a reaction and any interaction. Transparent.
Lisa it shouldn’t matter anymore to you what they do there in the coming months as you have canceled your trip. We have enough going on in our own state.
"Vacay567,I POSTPONED my trip, I didn't cancel."
"For when? I am trying to decide when I will if I have to.Edited: 6:09 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"janetduffield 2016,Oh, so it's ok to bash Trump for relying on private test kits instead of buying the ones from WHO (UN) but TCI can't take those kits? Are you saying there is some reason the UN won't give TCI the kits? If you don't like my posts, feel free to scroll on by."

I don't need to be stalked and threatened by weirdos and I will never reveal where we stay or when we will be there. My kids, husband and grandsons think I'm plenty nice (Don't you honey?

"I finally cancelled my flights for next week and we are postponing our trip until it’s safe for all. The man I rent from at the Regent Grand is honouring our payment whenever we choose to return. The kids and us are extremely sad as Provo has been our yearly trip for 10 March breaks in a row, but it’s the right thing to do at this point."
"Lisa M owes a lot of apologies, as I see it. To say the very least. Thanks to the folks who try to provide accurate, sober, REAL information in a time of crisis and confusion. The rest of you... you need to think about your behavior and what motivates you and informs your thinking."
"Okay, it is crystal clear to me and guessing number of others, that Lisa M. has no intention of traveling to TCI and is on this thread primarily to get reactions from others. Let’s stick to the topic and ignore the freaks."

"Sorry about the double post. But Susan LAX, you are correct about Dagney giving misinformation, aka, fake news. Not the first time."
"#213 Someone here may be a fraud and giving false information, but, it's not me. Posting False information hurts the people of the TCI... which I would never do.Dr. Tony Fauci and the US President have explained the test is very unpleasant. Dr. Fauci has explained that testing often makes people expel fluid.If you want a non-political opinion, it's been reported NBA player Donovan Mitchell from the Utah Jazz says the nasal swab was “so o uncomfortable it left him in tears,” Here's a link to some reports from people who have had the test performed on them: https:/…article241270441.htmlEdited: 9:49 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Dagny & Lisa time to sleep it off. Tomorrow is another day & give this forum a chance to catch up on actual trip concerns.

"To Follow-up re: #213, here is the Full Quote of NBA Player Donovan Mitchell from the Jazz from an interview on Good Morning America:""For us, it was a swab down the throat,... It was about 15 seconds of probably the most discomfort I’ve ever had. I ended up crying, like tears coming down my eyes. ... It was definitely unique, but I’m glad I was able to get it done.""So who's the fraud?! And who's giving false information? As always, truth is not scary. Facts are not scary. Ignorance is scary.https:/…"
"Dagny or Lisa M. y’all are clearly the same person using multiples again, typical Dagny.... the description of the swab test is not travel related, and if this brought him to tears, let’s hope he never truly experiences pain. Now please take a nap, you and your multiples need a rest. Byee!!!"
Was that the same disgusting NBA player who deliberately put his hands all over everything? Who cares? What does that have to do with anything in TCI?
"Susan LAX or neopatriots or emilys222 or or... Oh gosh, are those voices starting up again? Poor dear."
"So it's starting to hear voices now ..,"
Listen to the experts and stay at home. TCI will be there in a few months or next year. Protect yourself and protect others by social distancing. It’s the best chance we have collectively to minimize deaths. We canceled our trip as much as we hated to...rebooked for a later date.
We were booked to travel April 26 through May 8 canceled our trip not only for our safety but for the safety of Turks andCaicos residence And I do believe it is very selfish if you should travel at this time you’ll never know what you’ll catch at JFK
So why did Lisa M. ultimately decide to reschedule? I assume I missed that b/c of the removed posts.
"April, because schools have decided to close for a month starting Friday."
"Hi April,My decision to postpone our trip yesterday was based on the fact that TCI closed its schools for 30 days. I predict a major increase in crime and civil unrest. We stay in a place that is on ground level and near a public park. I said something to the effect of ""roving bands of teens"" causing havoc and one of the charmers in here promised to send a gang of them to my hotel, no charge. I personally flagged that post as a threat. Delta has said in a recording by phone that if I can't get through, all flight changes and cancellations will be honored, no fee. So while I am of course disappointed, I'll just do Spring gardening instead."
"Lisa M when a husband says ""yes dear"" it is not a compliment. lol Like I said, you are not a very nice person.Edited: 10:10 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Dear Admin,Please feel free to delete my reply in a bit. My apologies that my posts have triggered some snowflakes into responding with vile and off topic posts. There were a number of posts that apparently mentioned me that were removed before I even saw them, so I can't be blamed for their behavior. Vacay567>> Lisa M when a husband says ""yes dear"" it is not a compliment. lol Like I said, you are not a very nice person. <<1. Apparently, you do not have a sense of humor. Did you honestly think my husband was sitting next to me as I typed that post? Good grief.2. Not a compliment? I guess not. Maybe it is. We've been married for 44 years this May. He's a good looking, hard working, kind and decent husband, father and grandfather. I'm not looking for compliments here on Tripadvisor. I was looking for factual information regarding conditions on the ground. The fact that you repeatedly feel the need to call me ""not a very nice person"" when you have never met me in person, says way more about your own insecurities and self-hatred than it does about me.You have a nice day."
You seem awful.
