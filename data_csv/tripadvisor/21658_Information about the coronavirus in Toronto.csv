"Regarding the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) obviously people should stay calm and not panic. But it is good to stay informed if you are travelling to Toronto in the near future, as things are changing constantly, which is to be expected with something like this. Check the status of any events you are coming to Toronto to attend, especially if that is the primary reason for your trip. These websites might be helpful for general information about the virus in Toronto.https:/…https:/…https:/…https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontar…https:/…2019-novel-coronavirushttps:/…faqEdited: 5:35 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Great idea to start this thread; thank you!
"Handy links, I wonder how much notice there will be if US closes border to us."
Good links!!
Here's a report from one City Councillor:joecressy.com/the_cressy_courier_january_31_…
best to stay home & lock the doors Hope everyone has enough TP LOL
"We are travelling to Toronto, canada May 12 thru Delta airline then Via rail to Quebec and Montreal, we do not know if we should cancel all arrangement made and how hard it will be to cancel, by this time we still do not know what to do. Please help us decide. Will corona virus be clear by April?"
Will corona virus be clear by April?No one knows the answer to that question. Where are you coming from? Will the virus be clear from where you are in April? It's a global pandemic...
It is likely the number of cases will be much higher not lower in April assuming patterns are like they are in Asia and Europe.
"we are from Las vegas, sorry not to say before. As of now reported case of corona virus in Las vegas is 11 and as I hear from local news they are stable, no reported death.Edited: 9:52 am, March 14, 2020 "
"@erlinda fThe problem in the USA is that no one, not even the CDC or other officials, know how many potential Covid-19 cases there really are, only the ones that are really sick and therefore obvious. This is due to the complete failure of the current US administration to act promptly and arrange for test kits to be made available and authorize labs outside the CDC itself to do the testing.This is finally happening, but your health administration is now way behind the curve. The number of potential cases is likely much higher, but until significant testing is done, nobody knows. The USA has 9 times the population of Canada, but Canada has done more testing than that done in the entire USA so far. Highly likely it will be over by April.That is why there is potential talk of possibly restricting entry at the border. Almost half of our most recent cases have come from people who have visited the US. So please monitor news media and these forums to keep up-to-date.The Government of Canada is now recommending that Canadians not travel outside our country. Many tourist attractions in Quebec, Ontario , BC and Alberta are now shut down for at least 30 days and more will probably follow. VIA Rail has shut down its two long-distance trains, The Canadian and Ocean. So far local services are still operating, but that may change.You may soon be restricted as to which airports you will be permitted to use to enter and leave Canada. The federal government has already announced this, but not yet named the airports. There is also the possibility for all foreign visitors to face some type of quarantine period upon entry, but that is not yet on the table.Things are in flux here, as elsewhere in the world, and rapidly changing. If you can do so without penalties, you might want to postpone your trip for at least six months. Unfortunately, this is probably not the best time to be doing international travel."
+1 to #11
"CORRECTION TO MY POST #11...too late to edit.The last sentence in the second paragraph should read:""Highly UNLIKELY it will be over by April."""
"I am very worried about our neighbours to the South. Health care in the US is not available to all and they do not have the safety nets that we have. I think trade is important but we should do better screening of tourists from the US and the UK. Minimum checking temperatures at least. Seoul Korea seems to be handling this the best.PS. PiratePirate, I saw 3 robins this morning."
Apparently at the beginning of the infection there is no elevated temperature.
"I don’t know if this will help anyone that is currently trying to decide whether or not to cancel or delay their travel to Toronto, but just in case, I decided to copy and paste my recent response on the Iceland Forum directed to someone from Hamilton (Canada) asking about their plans to visit Iceland in June. I think the response may be valid for all travellers who are considering travel in the next few months:“Are your bookings flexible/cancelable? To be honest, I’m not sure early June is going to see a resolution of this worldwide event to the extent that people will feel comfortable travelling internationally; imo people in NA will still want to, and probably should be, sticking close to home even in June.Because you live in the same general area as I do, relatively speaking, I’d like to point out that the current measures being taken in Toronto, the GTA, Ontario and the rest of Canada is not to avoid entirely the spread of COVID-19 but to slow it down in order to avoid overwhelming our hospitals in the short term. Not only is it still flu season, so hospitals are already busy, but if the spread of COVID-19 is not slowed down locally then we will face a situation similar to what has occurred in Italy where the sudden development of large numbers of cases overwhelmed their medical system to the point of near collapse. The current measures (working from home if possible, shutting schools, etc) is NOT going to prevent the large majority of people from getting infected here too, but it will end up saving lives in the long run, because the medical system will be better able to handle the more serious cases. Thankfully it seems that for 80% of those who do get infected, the illness is fairly mild and similar to the flu.The reality is that this is a novel virus, so there is no immunity and no vaccine, as well as no known effective medications yet, and it will be 12-18 months before any new vaccines and medications will be safe for widespread use. Is that reason to panic now? No! As the virus continues to spread, more and more people will become immune and the outbreak will slow down, maybe even stop. We can all look to the current situation in Wuhan to gain insight into what the situation will likely look like 3-4 months from now. Would you be comfortable travelling to Wuhan now? Probably not, but life is getting back to a new normal there, as it will in Italy, and the rest of the world. How quickly it will get back to normal in any given country will have much to do with how willing people are to make changes and sacrifices now.”*****I too am worried about the situation south of our border; in the meantime we have much to be grateful for here at home. Take care everyone!"
Any idea how to register official complaint against any flight booking agency?. My parents coming on April 2nd and I tried to reach flightnetwork At Mississauga. When called started I got message that due to high volume it takes upto 2 hrs. But after 2.30hrs also no reply from them.they are 24/7 available as per their website. I also tried with my wife number in parellel but same result after 2hrs......so they are not helping in this bad time of us due to corona virus.....they should at least pickup phone and help to their clients....please help in you have any information.
"@ Jigisha, you can complain "" From Here to Eternity"" ( Burt Lancaster/ Deborah Kerr) We are in unusual times and all phone lines including airlines, Ontario Health , ad infinitum etc have abnormally long wait times."
"Listening to Trump at his press-conferrence, he is saying that this situation will go on till July-August."
"Update: Please note - some of the links from my original post have updated information on their websites, but not all. As the situation is changing constantly make sure any information you read is up to the minute. With all due respect best advice...stay home. Stay healthy and safe everyone.Edited: 1:57 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Another update: The borders (Canada - US) are closed for all ''non-essential'' travel. Looking ahead, I would suggest to re-visit the idea to travel to TO perhaps again in September or later and check the ''then'' conditions. Realistically I personally think that this year is a write-off travel-wise.And I can't help putting in a plug for travel agencies: if you booked with a reputable one, you will get someone to answer your query. On the internet, you are on your own. And no, I'm not an agent or owner, but a great believer in the service they provide."
I guess a lot of things are going to get cancelled. Things that are tourist dependent.

"Yesterday, Dr Anthony Fauci of the US corona response said that even if the cases go down in the summer, he expects the virus to be back in the fall. So I don't think the situation will be stable till they cook up a vaccine, probably next year."
