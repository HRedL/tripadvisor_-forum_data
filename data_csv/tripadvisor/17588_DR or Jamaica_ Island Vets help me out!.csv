Looking to decide between DR or Jamaica for November. Anyone have a better experience over the other? Will post on Jamaica Forum too. Thank you!
I perfer DR. the nonstop hard core peddling on the beach in Jamaica was too much for me.
Been to both. Both are good in their own ways. What are you looking for in your vacation?Edited: 1 year ago 
Both are nice and I guess it depends what you’re looking for but both are quite similar. DR resorts are nicer and there’s more options to fit your budget. The DR beaches are nicer. Food in Jamaica is good. I would pick DR though overall. It’s about as close to paradise as you can get.
Married in Jamaica and 20+ trips....would not go back any time soon. Stick with the DR
"Been to both and felt they had nicer newer modern resorts in Punta Cana and better food and beaches [ Negril ] in Jamaica. If you consider forum members on the Jamaica and DR forum, it is well know that the DR forum has some the nastiest, unhappy and angry members of any forum [ lol ]. As for people in the DR and Jamaica , they both have friendly and the nicest people you can meet . Been going to Jamaica lately until the FBI investigation results come out on the deaths in the DR then we can consider going back to the DR."
"Beaches are a bit better in Negril. Petty crime and rape are an epidemic in Jamaica, along with rampant hard drug abuse. Meth has made the place a non starter for me and the wife after 20 + trips"
"Safer in the DR, but Jamaica is very nice. One frustration I had with Jamaica was the lack of supplies at times. We stayed in Falmouth and they would run out of booze, beer and food items frequently. I am guessing that has more to do with being far away from the city. I doubt that happens as much in Montego Bay and Negril but it might.In November, Bavaro Beach area should be lovely without much seaweed. Other times of year I might consider Montego Bay/Negril just to prevent being affected by Sargassum/seaweed."
"Went to both locations this year. My vote is Jamaica. Nicer beach, tourism quality is better than Jamaica in my opinion. I had a high hope from DR, wanted to be proven wrong of their inability to offer a top class vacation at a 5-star resort (sanctuary cap Cana). My 4-star reaper (Royalton Jamaica) clearly won."
I would put PUJ on top.. less $ .. same white beach.. not as crime ridden. but if you haven't been to Jamaica you should try it so you can compare it yourself.
Both are good destinations. As mentioned food tends to be better in Jamaica and they speak english so it makes it a little easier. The Dominican Republic has nicer resorts and as good or better beaches. It tends to be cheaper from MSP. I’d go back to either one. But usually we end up in the Dominican Republic due to the price point.
"Hey. Definitely DR, at list for me. I’v been To Jamaica and now staying in DR. It’s more interesting over here. I am in love with ocean and fishing and it’s much cleaner and better over here."
I like both. In Punta Cana the people are nicer but in Jamaica everyone speaks English. You can drink the water in Jamaica. Better food in Jamaica. We saw or personally have had problems in the airport in Jamaica. No problems at the Punta cana airport. It's kind of a toss up but Punta Cana is generally cheaper. I'd pick Punta Cana.Chris
PC for price and value.
"Have been to both islands. If a good long walk on the beach is important, choose Negril over MoBay. I enjoyed being in the ocean more in DR as there were an abundance of urchins at both Jamaica locations we were at.  Enjoyed the food on both islands. I prefer Presedente over Red Stripe. Enjoyed getting out and about on both islands (both organized and non-organized tours). Felt a wee bit unsafe in MoBay, but it could have been the location. Have never felt unsafe in PC or POP. Both locations are beautiful. People on both islands were lovely. Bang for your buck - DR wins - but sometimes you just have to go explore for yourself!!Happy TravelsBugs"
"we went to Jamaica 18 months ago for the first time after many many trips to the DR. We stayed in Montego Bay at Secrets. I will say that i have a fear of ocean and underpull ect and i absolutely LOVED the beach area at secrets and loved seeing the starfish and nice litte fish around my legs! it was awesome. Room service was the best we have ever had. Restaurant food was ok..room was very nice but no nicer than some others we have had. Bottom line... more bang for buck in DR. We are heading back to punta cana in Sept to ambar. It will be our tenth time to ambar , and we have booked swimup room. It is almost HALF the price of a normal room at secrets st james."
