"Hello,Is someone know the situation about Zika in Cuba ?Is there some places not recommanded at the moment ?We have booked 2 weeks in april and my girlfriend is stressed.She is not pregnant but we want to start after getting home.ThxLau"
"I can only speak for the city of Camagüey in Cuba, where the Zika virus and the mosquito population that transmits it are now at near epidemic proportions. I just came back from Camagüey 3 weeks ago and I contracted the Zika virus while there too.The virus symptoms are quite mild... similar to a very mild influenza. No biggie. You'll know if you have contracted it because your skin will be covered in red blotches... there's no mistaking it for something else. If your girlfriend contracts the Zika virus while there, she would be able to safely conceive a child 2 weeks after her first signs of infection. But if you as a man contract the Zika virus, you should not engage in unprotected sex for 6 months after your first signs of infection. Do some research on the internet to confirm these details, and perhaps also speak with your family physician too. I wouldn't worry about it too much... literally thousands upon thousands of other tourists are visiting Cuba each week without contracting the Zika virus. I wasn't so lucky, but then I don't go where most tourists go in Cuba. Things are a bit different in the city of Camagüey.Buena suerte.Terry"
"In addition to what Terry has said, please discuss with your doctor."
"Hi John, I mentioned that too in my post... but no hay problem. It's also important to note that not everyone who contracts the Zika virus will show outward symptoms, so it's possible for some to contract the virus, and not even know that they have it. When I was still in Cuba, I quickly began feeling very ill one day and vomited once very violently within the space of 1 minute... but then I felt fine afterwards. At that point, I was unaware that I had contracted the Zika virus and I just thought that I had picked up a stomach bug from the local water or food. Even when the rash later appeared all over my body, I still felt absolutely fine, and continued to drink and party each day as if nothing was wrong. But I must admit, I looked absolutely horrid. When I got back to Canada, the skin rash began to dissipate, and then the further mild influenza like symptoms began to kick in. I'm now completely back to normal btw. TerryEdited: 2 years ago "
"Sorry Terry, I missed that in your post."
"Good to hear you're back to normal again, Terry."
"'The trouble with normal, is it always gets worse' :)"
"Thanks Spunky. My concern now is for Judi, because she's now 15 days late on her monthly. She could be pregnant again... that's yet to be confirmed. But if she is pregnant, well... I'm sure you can understand our sense of worry. Time will tell. Apparently ultrasound tests in the late 2nd and early 3rd trimesters will be able to spot cranial abnormalities if present. If Judi is indeed pregnant now, we'll cross that bridge together at that time and make an educated decision to end the pregnancy if necessary. We're both feeling sick about that possibility. Terry"
"That must be very stressful, sorry to hear that."
