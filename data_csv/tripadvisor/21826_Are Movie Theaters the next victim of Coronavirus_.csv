"Wednesday’s announcement to ban all public gatherings over 1000 people and requesting the abstinence of the public from gathering over 250 participants was exactly the same as the edict set down by San Francisco on Wednesday. Now SF bans audiences in movie theaters. https:/…Will Chicago, once again, follow suit? Stay tuned. The main feature will follow 26 minutes of coming attractions.Edited: 12:42 am, March 15, 2020 "
I think it’s inevitable. Restaurant and bar closures too.
"My gut feeling is yes. Within a day or so it’ll be Lightfoot, Pritzker, or both that will announce a complete shutdown of everything besides groceries and drug stores"
Guessing you might see it role out in NYC maybe SF and Seattle first.B.
It's here. It has happened:https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/3/16/21182…https://www.dailyherald.com/business/2020031…
"not surprising....it actually makes sense considering everything else is closed. maybe pritzker (along with his extended family members) should pry away some of their billions and help out some of these small businesses taking a big hit....Edited: 1:11 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"That, or the actual government. You know, the ones that bailed out the banks and now the airlines want a bail out. I’m sick of this because I need a bailout! Cut the pentagon money. If they need a new stealth fighter, let them have a bake sale."
"The airline thing really gets my goat. In return for a bailout, Congress should extract some consumer-friendly concessions, like eliminating ticket-change fees, checked bag fees, seats that have sufficient legroom between rows and toilets that are big enough for plus-size passengers."
I thought it already happened and why they released movies early.
"in response to culturvulture's above post, i pulled this from a facebook post........--------------------------To the public saying that the airlines don’t deserve a bailout,The airlines in the USA provide jobs to more than 750,000 people in the United States. Indirectly they provide jobs to over 10 million people. They transport more than just vacation travelers. They transport organs for transplant, life saving medications, medical equiptment, people seeking medical treatment, military personel, your mail, your amazon orders and your family members. They provide relief for emergency situations like hurricanes, mass fires, earthquakes, and floods. They provide a means of quick evacuation, and rapid emergency response. They help drive over 1.7 Trillion dollars into our economy. And they do that all while working as the fastest and safest means of transportation. Yes they help you go on vacation, and yes they are a big business, however they are a vital part of our economy and our everyday lives. If they are let to fail as a result of this virus, then the effects will be widespread and devastating for our nation and the world. So take a minute, look around you, think about your life and how the airlines have influenced it.Sincerely,An Airline EmployeeEdited: 1:42 pm, March 20, 2020 "
They made billions in profits and blew it all on stock buybacks.
"ST,I don't says they don't need a bailout but in pursuing profit, the airlines are making flying a miserable experience for the public. It's time the pendulum swung back the other way. I'm old enough to remember the days before deregulation when flying was a pleasant experience."
"i blame deregulation........like any entity, whether it's the airlines, trucking, railroads, big pharma, big chem, electricity, wind, waterways, plumbing, wind, predatory animals....the list goes on. everything takes the path of least resistance. no regulation, no safety valves.....which is why the airlines are in the sorry state they've been in over the past 40 years....Edited: 2:44 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Agree with Culture vulture. The airlines are ridiculous. They mismanage themselves and are terrible to the flying public. I personally don't think they should get a bail out. Let them figure out how to survive, or go under. Like the little drycleaner or small cafe down the street."
"I don’t want airline employees to take the hit, as of course the execs will be fine. But some stipulations need to be put in place, starting with stock buybacks and exec compensation."
"if i heard it right, the donald stated any money given to the airlines is not to be used for anything but keeping the airlines operating.... ie-no raises for executives, no fluff, etc. airline employees, and supporting contractors (fuelers, caterers, toilet dumpers, skycaps, ticket agents, bag smashers, cleaners etc), will definitely take a hit. you can be sure, with 60% reductions in flights, there's no way they can sustain keeping everyone employed, even with federal help. nevertheless, if chrysler, GM and the banking industry can receive bailouts, then the airline industry can too...."
"""if i heard it right, the donald stated any money given to the airlines is not to be used for anything but keeping the airlines operating.... ie-no raises for executives, no fluff, etc......""ST, he had his fingers crossed behind his back!"
"I don’t think Various industries get a “turn” at being bailed out because they are so financially irresponsible. I say let them go under. Don’t worry, both nature and business hate a vacuum. There will be another airline up and runny soon enough. I’m sure Richard Branson already has a few orders placed for new gates needing an airline...."
"Airlines have been actually extremely financially responsible. There is not a business alive that can survive loss of up to 90% of their customers.Airlines have also moved to consolidation. There is no room for an airline to be up and running soon. Branson has tried to sell and not sell Virgin so there is certainly no stability there. For those of you that complain that Airlines are making flying impossible... you are probably in some way correct. However, you need to put your money where your mouth is. Airline prices have FALLEN 50% since 1978. If you want a $179 super sale or basic economy then you get what you pay for. You can't have it both ways. B."
"@Booya,very well said. if TA allowed us to rate posts like they do with reviews, you'd get a 5+ from me. the spirit airlines of the world will likely go BYE BYE. and the bransons and elon musks of the world trying to start up airlines will be a big FAIL. after the carnage, the Big Three (plus Southwest) will be left standing.... generally, people have NO CLUE as to what it takes to run an airline. if you're pi$$ed about the service you get, then blame the politicians 40+ years ago who pushed for deregulation. like i said in an earlier post....path of least resistance. the airlines, like any other industry, will compete for the most customers.... how? by lowering ticket prices (which were regulated by the CAB--google it)... how do you lower prices? by degrading or taking away services that were once standard, like meals, unlimited, or nearly unlimited bags etc.... they also cut costs, so you can have cheap tickets, by contracting out supporting functions such as ticket agents, bag handlers, maintenance, cleaning, fueling etc....and cutting wages, or laying off employees. and then you complain about it....like the old saying goes: ""you get what you pay for""."
"ST, we aren’t talking about why airplanes aren’t profitable, this thread is about whether the airlines should be bailed out by the taxpayer. Southwest earned $754 million in 2013, making that its 41st consecutive year of profitability. JetBlue, which was founded in 1999, has made money five years in a row. What is JetBlue doing that AA or UAL cant do? Don’t even get me started on the Asian Airlines that are way better at customer service. From Forbes: “Meanwhile, Southwest and JetBlue’s larger competitors continue to lumber, fall, fail to adapt, and essentially parallel everything their sauropod equivalents did in the Cretaceous era. Some older airlines eventually do figure it out, however. 2013 was an exceedingly profitable year for Delta, as the company made $11 billion on sales of $38 billion. Delta paid off debt, started issuing a dividend again, and rejoined the Standard & Poor’s 500 eight years after filing for bankruptcy. That’s a far cry from the mid-2000s, when Delta had amassed as many consecutive losing years as JetBlue has profitable ones."
"most asian and middle eastern airlines are state-run, or heavily backed by the got't, which is why you can have gold-plated toilets on emirates.... our airlines don't have that luxury, so naturally, their service won't be as nice. from what i understand, the US airlines in general have had record, or near record, profits in the past few years... despite that, like Booya said, there's no way they can survive a prolonged shut down like this. 9/11 was shocking, the airlines completely shut down for a week or 2, and traffic was slow for the next year or so..... the things that allowed 9/11 to happen were more or less fixed with tighter security and such.... BUT, i think this will cause far more damage, for a longer time----can't fix this situation until there's a vaccine, which the experts say will be at least a year...and that's IF they come up with a vaccine.as for jet blue and southwest... somebody once told me they're the chevy's of the (US) airline world.....to compete, AA, UAL, and DL are trying fit a luxury model into a chevy budget.....and it doesn't work. but they still need to try to compete with the chevy business model. which is why you lost all your standard services with the legacy airlines... also, i might add...southwest, and jet blue operate with ONE fleet type (737's for SWA and Scarebusses for JB), which cuts costs immensely..... pretty hard to fly ORD to hong kong on a 737.... the big 3 fly these routes and need more comprehensive fleets, which in turn, drives up costs all the way around...."
Airlines are necessity. No on will argue that. Their bailout is all but a sure thing. It is necessary. What that bailout looks like is what is important. I can't think of an industry who had their business basically destroyed twice in 20 years. We will see what happens.B.
The airlines can borrow money at dirt cheap rates. They can use their existing fleet as collateral.An analysis by Bloomberg found that between 2010 and 2019 the biggest US airlines spent 96 percent of the money they had left over after covering expenses and capital expenditures buying back their own stock.
"Yes, Dave, they sure do buy back their own stocks. The low cost loans are also an option that I agree with. And ST, yes SW does use the one plane for their routes while UAL uses the triple 7s but ORD to Beijing costs customers a lot more than ORD to Orlando. It’s not like going around the world costs the consumers the same amount of money as a short hop."
"other than cancun, maybe a few carribean destinations and canada, SWA is pretty much a domestic carrier, so they can get away with using 1 fleet....plus, they cater mostly to the vacation crowd, which generally, isn't as demanding as the business crowd, especially the international business crowd.... by using 1 airplane, they cut costs on pilot training, maintenance and a host of other things because everything is standardized. yes, it's cheaper to fly a short hop, but over the entire spectrum of the company, it costs a fortune to run the airline.... like i said, most people have no clue as to what it takes to run an airline."
So tell us something we don’t know. It is well documented that SWA airline figured out how to do a profitable airline. The legacies keep doing the same thing and wonder why it won’t work. So why would we bail them out?
for the reasons in my earlier post---100's of thousands of jobs are at stake....
"Well, then bail out the restaurants, bars, Macy’s, Nordstrom’s and on and on. All I’m saying is the legacies need to either build a better mousetrap or maybe go back to regulation if they can’t. And, evidently, they can’t."
