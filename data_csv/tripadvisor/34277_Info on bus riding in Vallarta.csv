If you click on that link, it will also show you what the inside of the bus looks like with people wearing masks.....—————————-“Update for Puerto Vallarta: Buses with more than 50 passengers will not be allowed to circulate; use of masks is mandatory.”“Martha Ramirez Ruiz | July 9, 2020”“Four filters were installed to verify that they do not exceed that number if more are lowered from the unit so that it can circulateNo more than 50 passengers must be on board urban trucks/buses as one of the preventive measures against Covid-19, only 15 people will be allowed to travel on foot and 35 in the seats, otherwise they will not be allowed to circulate.This was confirmed by the president of Transporte Unido Costa Pacífico, Luis Romero Chávez, when he reiterated the mandatory use of mask to board the units and that they must carry it during the trip in the trucks.Romero Chavez, said that since yesterday four filters were installed by the Municipal Roads to verify that the trucks do not circulate with more than fifty passengers, which would be those who travel seated and 10 to 15 maximum on foot, depending on the space of each unit.In those cases where there are more passengers on board, they will not be able to circulate until the passengers who exceed that number get off the truck, and in those filters they will have to wait until another unit passes where there is space.He said that in case a user does not have mask, the unit operator would provide it, ""we have dated at least five mask to each unit,"" as well as that they distribute those in the terminals.Romero Chávez said that since the beginning of the pandemic, the company has been willing to apply preventive measures, and that at the arrival and departure of each truck, the units are disinfected.He said that in view of the reluctance of some drivers to use the mouthpiece or that they did not do it properly and only brought it on their chins, by agreement of the company at least 75 were sanctioned by resting them for a week.On the other hand, he refuted that urban transport is the second source of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as health authorities claim, ""these are only generic statistics"" without considering the particularities of each municipality. Because in Puerto Vallarta, since mid-March, the company's trucks have implemented the required protocols.In addition, to date they have only reported one driver who was infected with Covid-19. But it was detected in time, and he complied with the isolation until the disease was overcome.Surveillance operations in public transportFor her part, the Deputy Director of Municipal Roads, reported that once again the unit monitors that passengers bring their mouthpieces, rather than the number of users above the vehicle, for which four filters were installed surveillance:1.- Francisco Villa Avenue and Santiago River.2.- Av. Prisciliano Sánchez and Arboledas.3.- Mexico Ave. and Monterrey Tech.4.- Highway 200 and Miguel Barragán street.In these surveillance filters the trucks will be checked to verify the number of people on board and the use of the mouthpiece of both the driver and passengers or otherwise. The elements will proceed to:Infraction to the truck driver for not using his mask.Citizens who do not use mask, even though they have it on some part of their body other than their face, will be invited to use it, otherwise they will be invited to get out of the truck because they do not want to use it.Citizens who do not wear mask, invite them to get off the truck because they do not want to use it.If the citizen does not agree to get off the truck, inform him that the truck will not move until he gets off the truck.”http://contralinea.netEdited: 2:26 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"This was just posted by the Governor of Jalisco. The translation is a bit messy so I added a few comments in parentheses: ""During the pandemic, leaving home is a risk. Streets and public transport should only be for those who have to work and, although we have strengthened the supervision of health measures in units, it is up to everyone to reduce the risk of infections of #COVID19Nothing else for you to give an idea, from June 18 to date, 220 sanctions have been applied to drivers for uploading passage without cover, as well as 292 sanctions on trucks (buses), 148 taxis and 88 Transport system vehicles for not sanitizing as it should.In addition, today 8 thousand mouths (masks) were delivered to passengers and 1,500 other units were supervised. But, eye (yes), although the task of supervising is ours, the responsibility of not leaving home without cover is yours. If you take care of yourself, you take care of us all."""
Thank you MarJPV. “Google Translate” isn’t always perfect so what you added is very helpful.
"MarJPV..""During the pandemic, leaving home is a risk. Streets and public transport should only be for those who have to work and, although we have strengthened the supervision of health measures in units, it is up to everyone to reduce the risk of infections of #COVID19""This says it all! Thank you for your continued boots on the ground posts. Stay well and safe"
"Just vocabulary clarification. In Mexico buses are called ""camiones"" which usually means trucks.Also, when they ""mouthpiece"" they mean ""face mask""Edited: 3:21 pm, July 11, 2020 "
So the translation for mouthpiece is facemask? Bus I believe is autobus. Raw meat for the balcony.
Autobus is mainly used for long distance services whereas camion is used for buses around town.
"You are 100% correct, gopkrs. During all my Spanish classes in PV (from 2007 to 2011), the teachers would make that very clear. Teachers were all locals.Camion is the local transport in PV. Autobus is long-distance transport. I even tested it over the years, in riding most routes in central PV regularly. I would verify it with the locals standing with me (if we were waiting for awhile)... They always confirmed that the ""blue and green buses"" (that's what they used to be called, but now they are all white) around town were ""camiones."" So that, if someone on a street corner asked a local when the bus would be there, and used ""autobus"" they might easily be directed to the Central Bus Station past the airport."
