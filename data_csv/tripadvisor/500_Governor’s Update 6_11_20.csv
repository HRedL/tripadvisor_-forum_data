"Per the Governor of PR’s announcement this evening:-The curfew has been changed to 10 pm to 5 am-All establishments will reopen, including restaurants, churches, gyms, and movie theaters-Sports events may be reinstated -Occupancy per establishment will increase to 50%-Daycare centers may reopen -Tours may be reinstated-Beaches will remain open, and may be visited as long as social distancing practices are being observed-Facial masks will be required at all establishments, venues, beaches, and/or during events-6 feet of distance must be observed at all times Phase 4 of the reopening is July 4th. As far as external tourism, the island will officially reopen on July 15th."
"Also, one of the points that was stressed during and after the announcement is that although the lockdown/quarantine has been lifted, the curfew stays (though it now starts at 10 pm). That means that people no longer are required to go outside only for the necessary purposes. They may now go out for any reason, but are required to be back inside by 10 pm."
"Thanks for keeping us all updated.From my perspective, this is the best possible news we could've hoped for."
Thank you. This is very informative. Appreciate it!
Thanks for the update. Now wondering if I should still try and come for the 4th of July weekend or wait until after the 15th..
"@BeachFinder92: Based on the information provided by the Governor, it looks like July 15th would be the better time to visit. It sounded like everything is expected be up and running, and somewhat normally then.Edited: 6:22 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"Thanks again for your post.After thoroughly searching, I'm unable to find any information on the new executive order.I don't mean to be disrespectful in the least, but what is the source of this information?"
"@jbings: The source of this information is, as listed above, the Governor’s update, which took place earlier this evening. I streamed it, and translated as it took place, and added the contributions of the commentator: Jay Fonseca."
"Here’s a link to the Governor’s update. It’s local news. Therefore, it’s of course, in Spanish: https:/…"
Thank you so much for this information you made my night.
"wow thanks for the info, I was supposed to come march 28-april 4th. That was what i've been looking forward to all year. Im a teacher and have limited time to travel (lots of time but limited to specific time periods). The only tim I will be able to come see the magnificance of PR is july/august. Was thinking of rescheduling for august, what is your guys predictions on how things will be by then? Based on this thread, it's looking good but i'm look for opinnions from people who are following the news there or live there and can judge the feel of how things are going there. Don't give me any alarmist scare tactic messages, just honest opinnion"
"@Borland204: I follow the local news daily. My parents live on the main island, and are currently visiting me, so not only do we watch the local news every day, but I receive information from 2 people currently living on the island.I think that the Governor's update was very thorough, and filled with good news. Things are looking up for PR. It helped the island that things have been so strict, and the residents following the rules. I don't have anything but positive things to say about visiting PR after July 15th. I not only think that the island will be ready for visitors then, but it will need tourism to help the economy.Please do be advised that the update was made by the Governor. No information has been provided by Vieques' nor Culebra's mayors. If this changes, I will share."
I doubt the US Canada border will be open by august for you to travel to Puerto Rico
So after June 15 international and US tourists can arrive?
July 15th. Not June 15th.
Thank you for the information. Planning trip Aug 5 - 15.
"After July 15 all Carribien will be open mostly - a lot off choices - and no reason go to complicated by many sides Puerto Rico., Goo--dd-- luck!!"
Puerto Rico will be fine. It did fine after the hurricane and will be fine now. Your posts are so incredible stupid and you lack any spelling comprehension I feel more for you in your life than Puerto Rico. Good luck with staying alive.
"We are going 100% for sure on Jun 18th and staying all over the island, including San Juan, Cabo Rojo, southeastern and also Vieques. We will be there a total of 10 days. When we get there I'll try to post updates on what exactly is happening on the ground, but this was wonderful and amazing news, since we were going no matter what. Our flights are still firm, our reservations still firm. I talked to several of our hotel staff at several different hotels and they are all confirming the beaches are going to be fully open, along with hotel pools, starting the June 16th. Many have already opened their restaurants early, Will update soon...."
Thank you Mathew
@paris7002 thank you very much for the info
"This latest information is quite helpful. My daughter's wedding is scheduled for late July in Isla Verde and we are moving forward with our plans. While we are not locals, about 75% of the guests live on the Island (my future son in law is Puerto Rican). We plan to follow all local ordinances/guidelines."
"@BeachFinder92: I’m with you. They asked so many questions, and all for a disrespectful response. As if NY’s situation were any better these days... lol."
Yayyy this is good news! Maybe I should book October after all lol. I just wanna thank all the members who share all this information and patiently answer all our questions!
"Also, temperatures are being taken at the airport upon arrival. But unless there is a fever, there is not a self quarantine requirement."
"Some hotels replied me that they are reopened for tourists from Ny at June 15, the same from Applevacation phone reply."
"Thank You for the information. Originally, we had planned to go to Puerto Rico June 9th, but moved our trip to July 28th a couple of weeks ago. I am happy we did."
"Hi, my last odd guess that US tourists from different states are considered as internal, not external. I see many posts that people from NY have already great vacations in progress in beginning of June in San Juan. Please clarify. Thank you!"
External means OUTSIDE OF AMERICA. Traveling to Pr has never been considered external so there is no need to clarify. Please refrain from posting your ramblings in the thread and save the discussion for people looking for information.
"Here were many posts from US states people with hesitations for travel to PR, ever to have a short transit stay, and how 14 days quarantine can effect them, not only posts and questions from me. Especially after this ""Gov/ update June 11 posts"" from 'Expert"". Do not be aggressive and relax."
"@Borland204 I just got BACK from Puerto Rico! Spent 9 days there early June 2020, everything is open, all is good, news is not accurate. Come any time don’t worry I’m telling you."
?!?!?!?!
"To clarify:""External"" tourism means ""non-local/internal"" tourism. The term ""external"" refers to all visitors that do not live on the island: US mainland residents, Europe, Asia, etc.The residents of the island are encouraged to do internal/local tourism so they can enjoy what the island has to offer, plus it contributes to the economy. Both types of tourism are both equally important.Edited: 8:10 am, June 16, 2020 "
"@OliviaTravelocity: I'm not really sure what your issue is with me, or the information I provide; nor why you doubt my ""Expert"" designation. But should you require reassurance, please refer to my very long list of contributions, consider the fact that I was born, raised, and lived on the island for 25 years, still visit often, and closely watch the local news, AND realize that I am not obligated, nor am I paid to to spend my personal time helping YOU."
"External tourism - Which is from your posts will be open on July 15. How so many people from US states ( not from island) already, in spite restrictions, a good vacations in progress without 14- days quarantine in PC? Here are posts on trip advisor from them. Many hotels are already welcoming non-island folks from beginning of the June, not a July. That is what I do not understand from this ""6/11// Update"". I did not mean to offend anybody, in this odd time a lot of confusion and changes are going so fast. Here is still a question can you go on vacation ( as non-island resident) in PC in June?"
"@OliviaTravelocity: Constant question of the information I provided -with a link to prove everything I mentioned was accurate- is in fact, offensive. It puts my credibility in jeopardy, when I don't have a reason to provide information that is untrue. There's a fine line between the pandemic confusion, and just trying to make someone look bad. Please note this is my last attempt to address your ""doubts"".I NEVER once said no one can go now. I said it's best to go on July 15th, when everything will be open, per the Governor. Whether or not businesses chose to open now is not something she ordered, and therefore didn't announce on her update. But just because the Governor decided on July 15th, it doesn't mean ALL businesses will follow the rules to a T. They will do what they want because it's not against the law to do reopen now.""Here is still a question can you go on vacation ( as non-island resident) in PC in June?""Yes. The airport never closed so you can go whenever you want. Just understand that -as stated on my initial post- there is still a curfew in progress, and not everything will be open and operating normally. That will happen in July 15th. I hope this is clear to you now. Best of luck to you.Edited: 11:23 am, June 16, 2020 "
"We are booked and will be landing in San Juan SJU on Thursday 6/18 afternoon. I'll let everyone know how that process goes and how our check in goes at our hotel. X factor for us is still if the Ferry will let non-residents on to go to Vieques. We've planned that for 6/23 so it gives them maybe another week to get organized and allow people on the ferry? Who knows, but we are sure hoping so But even several I've talked to on Vieques island (hotel operator, restaurant operator) aren't 100% sure. Looks like it's going to be a dice roll. We will keep everyone updated on how things are on the ground. PR here we come, ready or not. Mas Pina Coladas por favor, and keep em coming."
"@MatthewTerri, Info about visiting Vieques in June is definitely still unclear, as you say. We own a vacation home on the island and are still hesitant to book a trip. As of today, refuge beaches remain closed. Announcement of a reopening date is expected soon. I have not heard that any tours are operating at this time, including BioBay tours. Relative to the ferry (or even flights, for that matter) it's not clear. Up until now, only those with proof of Vieques residency were supposed to be permitted to travel to the island, unless special written permission was granted by the Mayor. This week, beginning today, it sounded as if ""internal tourism"" was permissable. Most interpreted this as PR residents only. Others have interpreted it more broadly, to include US citizens. I know the Mayor was opposed to the island opening to tourists but don't know if he has any authority to supercede the Governor's Executive orders. July 15th is the date identified for all travel restrictions to be lifted, with the stipulation that this is subject to change if there's a spike in positive test results between now and then. All the uncertainty makes planning difficult. Add to that the fact that the ferry system is a mess for tourists to begin with, has been operating on a drastically reduced schedule, while limiting capacity in accordance with social distancing. I have heard that even island residents who need to travel between VQS and main island are unable to board and being left behind, and they are always given priority. Good Luck with your travels. I'm very interested in hearing what your experience is and hope that you do report back to share it."
"Current article dated today relative to status of tourism for Vieques. Focus is on the ferry, but touches on other factors also. It's in Spanish, but easy to translate using Google Translate.https:/…"
"Thank you for that link on Vieques sounds like it's a little dicey by boat. Which brings the question, can a person still fly to Vieques? Specifically, does anyone know if the Ceiba airport is open and allowing tourists to fly over to Vieques? Seems like for 80 bucks for two, that's a very reasonable option if the ferries are all booked up or not working very smoothly. Anybody got a thought on that plan to get to Vieques? Would rather go from Ceiba than SJU, just because it's more economical..."
"I am sure sunlvr5 is a much better source for this question than I am, but I will share my research. My plans are to visit Vieques in January. Based on information from previous posts, I am flying into SJU. I plan on going by Uber to San Juan Isla Grande Airport (SIG). Vieques Air Link has round trip flights from there, currently $85 per person, each way. Can you fly there now? I have no idea. Hopefully sunlvr5 or someone else has this info. On the website it allows you to book a flight, but also has a travel advisory concerning travel to Vieques. There is a phone number for the airlines (1 888 901 9247). I was going to wait to book my trip, but I just noticed American Airlines just cut the fare in half from DFW for my Jan trip. I think I'm booking now."
"We flew into SJU 6/18 about 4pm. You cannot leave the airport without going through a check line with hazmat suited-up employees asking you whether you'd like to get a COVID test or not. I'd say we were asked about 3 times and said no all three times. We had to stand in the exit line to exit the airport for about an hour, it was super busy. Once we got to the front of the line, we were asked three simple questions about fever, cough and symptoms, and told to go to a ""Table X"" and visit with another hazmat suited employee sitting behind a computer. The computer guy asked our name, what city we were staying in, and our phone number. That was it, then we were allowed outside the airport. All in all not a bad experience except for the long line wait because of several planes coming in at once. But nobody said anything about quarantine, nobody threatened anything, nobody said you HAVE to take a test. It was all very nonchalant and civil. We got in our rental car bus, grabbed our car off-site without much effort, and immediately headed to our hotel. At the car rental place they did a fever check with the little fever gun thingy they point at your forehead. Same with the hotel. Masks were required several places, but not all. There are people wandering around our hotel (Stellaris Marriott) without masks. The beaches are completely open and we're driving all around in our rental with no problems. More updates to come, happy to field questions."
I’m totally on the same boat as you are. I was supposed to go at the end of May but rescheduled for Aug 18-22. We’ve been watching and waiting to see how the situation looked by then. Here’s hoping it’s better somehow!
Thank You Ryane S for that nice report. I'm sure folks will appreciate it.
"hello We were planning to have a 4 day vacation on JUly 4th weekend coming from Virginia, US - I am hoping that is ok and that we do NOT have to stay for 2 weeks for a self quarantine. Can you please confirm that?thx in advance..."
Why don’t you read instead of spamming the same questions everywhere? Numerous people have stated you don’t need to quarantine plus you’re a grown man so please stop asking
"Vieques Update!! We purchased our tickets ahead of time online for the ferry at the suggestion of an officer right at the Ceiba ferry terminal. We hopped in our car, pulled up the porferry.com website on the iPhone and grabbed the tickets for there and back with no problems about 20 bucks total (we know that’s $ high but it was a sure ticket suggested by the officer). They told us to be there an hour early to our 9:30 ride and we were on the dot. The ferry left the dock at 9, thirty minutes early. So make sure you’re there early. Or you’ll be left. No problems getting on the ferry or parking which is a short shuttle ride away that runs nonstop so that went smooth. Got to Vieques (V) in 35 minutes on smooth water and it was air conditioned and very comfortable and not very crowded. Once on V we had a great time, had some weird instances of beaches being open then closed for what seemed like no reason. Speaking specifically about sun bay. But all the other non-refuge beaches were totally open and you have your pick of about 10+ beaches depending on what you like. You have to find them and take off roads and things but really no problem but we’d suggest a Jeep. The bio bay was closed. The refuge and all related beaches closed. Esperanza was totally dead and closed with the exception of ONLY Lazy Jacks. Which is amazing and super fun. Everything else was closed in Esperanza. In the main town Isabelle lots of shops were opened and restaurants were open but for some reason a couple of shops weren’t letting tourists inside (souvenir shop). But most welcomed tourists including the grocery stores and eateries and we had no trouble finding good food, liquor and whatever we needed. The roads suck. If you can’t find a place to stay call THe Wave. They’re super nice and accommodating and accepting of tourists, helpful and good value and great views. Our ferry on the way back was at 11 and we got there at a few minutes before 10 and about 10:00 it left. So again. Be early to your ferry. But no problems and the iPhone scannable ticket email worked great and the ferry people were nice. Good luck!!"
Good information. Thank you for taking the time to share. Enjoy the rest of your stay.
"Yes, very good info! Thank you for sharing. We are planning an upcoming trip from 7/5-7/13 and are wondering about how the dust storm has affected your trip. Would you say it has hindered your experience or that it’s more of a non-issue? Our airline is allowing us to change our flights if desired, but we’re not sure if it’s worth rescheduling. Any info is much appreciated. Thank you in advance!"
"Hello! Thank you to everyone who has been position current information- it has been very helpful! I will be traveling to Puerto Rico from July 1-8, and had a question about Vieques. From reading through the thread, it seems that most people have not had to quarantine (which is great news!), however we reserved an Airbnb in Vieques and have heard very mixed things from property owners there- some saying it’s fine for us to come and others saying there is a strict quarantine in place for non-residents. Is anyone perhaps familiar if there are currently different restrictions in place for those traveling to Vieques (and of Culebra, as I imagine there may be similar policies?) Thank you!!!"

"Thank you! We're a group of senior golfers seeking to vacation during July. Where can we get accurate information about the latest measures required for golf courses and play. I understand that a strict 6 feet distancing applies to all sports, including golf, as well as wearing masks indoors on the clubhouses. The individual hotels and resorts are giving us contradictory information."
"You are a group of seniors looking to travel right when things have just reopened and people are desperate to get out. It’s like the flood gates have opened and everyone -sick, unknown, and careless- are pouring out. I hate to discourage you, but are you aware of how dangerous that is for your age group? Covid cases are rising more now. Please watch the news and make an informed decision. The golf courses will still be there when it’s safe. Better safe than sorry."
Just want to confirm - you are US residents from the mainland that arrived to Puerto Rico before July 15 (obv)? My family and I have flights for July 6th and we're eager to confirm if we will be allowed in with the same experience. Thanks!

"Adding to the original post, the Governor announced yesterday that the curfew will be extended until July 22nd. Should any additional changes occur, I will keep you posted on this thread."
"Hello All, I called up the hotel I will be staying in from July 3-6 and they said that Covid-19 tests were being mandated at the SJU airport - does anyone who has just visited the island have any updates whether the PR airport department is making getting a test compulsory to enter the island even for americans?Please let me know"
"@lordoftravel: Tests are required at the airport unless visitors can provide medical evidence of not being infected. In other words, you can get tested right before your trip to PR, and use the negative result as proof, or you will have to get tested at the San Juan airport upon arrival.It makes sense because the locals have been through an extremely strict quarantine in order to keep the infections numbers low. The government is trying to prevent the virus from entering the island and put the local efforts and sacrifices at risk."
Thanks for your response Paris7002...Do you know how much the test costs and how long it takes?Is this a temperature test or the other invasive test where they put a ear bud looking thing up your nose?Multiple Folks on this post have mentioned that they were offered the test at the airport but it was optional - has that policy changed to mandatory now?Please let me knowthanks in advance
"I want to clarify, and I apologize for any confusion. The test (the actual test, not a device to check temperature), although available at the airport, it is not mandatory (at this time) to take the test upon arrival. It is in fact, optional. But it is seriously being considered, so as things change from one minute to the next, it may become mandatory (if the pressure from the health department continues).There is no cost for the test."
"We need to get facts straight and many of the reports going back and forth may not be correct. COVID tests cost at least $100 each and the fastest take at least 15-20 minutes to process. I question whether everyone is now getting them at the airport. If they are, it would be the only airport in the world doing this and it would effectively close the airport down. I think people are confusing temperature scans with tests. I am returning to PR tomorrow night and I will report. Optional tests are possible. The last post refers to something called immunity passports being required to get in. That is being debated in Europe. I am involved with that issue. I am sure that is not happening.Let's be careful what we are reporting on this forum."
"I am not referring to the immunity passports. According to the local news, the actual tests are available at the airport. The tests were originally intended to be mandatory for residents of the northeast mainland (mainly NY, NJ, PA) due to the high number of cases in said states. However, the intention was quickly dismissed just like things are quickly changing when it comes to Covid-19. This is why I had to go back and change the information I previously shared.Unfortunately, the Governor has a history of easily being influenced, and even easier to changing her mind. So things are never a certainty when it comes to PR. What we know now, may change within the next hour.I'm constantly watching the news, so I will update if as new information becomes available."
"thank you all for providing this critical information and clarifications since we are all living in incredibly uncertain times. .. I will be travelling on July 3rd morning so will keep checking this post to see if tests have been made mandatory so please keep this post current with the latest updates... Its not I am afraid of taking the test per say, but in case I am one of those that come out positive even if I am asymptomatic, I am afraid that I will be asked to stay in the island quarantined for 2 weeks and will not be able to get back to my work/life in Virginia..."
The Governor just announced starting 7/15 passengers arrived in PR must have taken a PCR test 72 hours before flying and receive a negative result. Those who don’t take the test must quarantine for 14 days in PR.
"I did a bit of research, so I'll make this as simple as possible:- Passengers that arrive to the airport must bring evidence of having taken a molecular test 72 hours prior to arriving at the island. - If you arrive at the island but do not have evidence of haven taken the molecular test you will be forced into quarantine for 14 days. - If forced into quarantine, you will be forced to take a serological test. You will have to pay for it, it's not provided by the government. The cost will vary. - Hotels and Airbnb's will be asked for a negative test for all of their guests. - You will have to fill in a form from the Department of Health.- All passengers will be required to utilize masks in order to enter Puerto Rico.Edited: 12:19 pm, June 30, 2020 "
""" but in case I am one of those that come out positive even if I am asymptomatic, ""Asymptomatic people are a big part of the spreading problem."
"we are scheduled to arrive tomorrow for a 5 day stay at the St. Regis. I just called the hotel (in PR, not the mainland number) and they said that the Governor just announced that there will be mandatory COVID screening beginning tomorrow, July 1, at the airport unless you can show evidence of a negative test. This is obviously not consistent with what has been posted here but it seems that it just came out? Is there a source of formal policy for this? I cannot confirm what the Regis is telling me but I don't think they would be wrong about this as it would not be in there best interest to tell guests this."
"Makjes, I can confirm through numerous sources I found that the requirements are effective on July 15th. It is possible the hotel got confused, as the information was just announced and I've also noticed several people on social media saying it starts today, but that's not correct. According to the governor, the new rules will take effect from July 15.Edited: 1:11 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Thanks Jose. I just checked with the Ritz and they confirmed what you are saying. They said that the airport produces the official travel advisories, so I am checking now. I will report back if I hear anything different but for now I am going with what you are reporting."
"We had to cancel our trip to St Lucia in July and are looking for a good alternative for August (thinking the end of august). We havent been to puerto rico in about 10 years but thoroughly enjoyed our first vacatin there. I imagine things have changed quite a bit and our financial situation has also changed a lot.What would the best resorts/options be for a couple in their low 30s that enjoy beaches, snorkling, and excursions a plenty? We were planning a butler level suite at sandalas in st lucia so hoping to find something as comparable as possible. St Lucia seems to have the resorts open but seemingly shut down most of the excursions which is the main reason we would be vacationing. No point in traveling to paradise only to sit in a hotel room haha! Thanks in advance for any tips/feedback"
TT: You might want to use another thread for questions like that and leave this one to the important discussion of quarantines and testing requirements
I just checked with JetBlue regarding my flight tomorrow 7/1. They have heard nothing about it.
"I have a trip (tentatively) planned for late July. It's refundable, so nothing's set in stone.How much does the COVID test at SJU cost, and how long does a result take?Here in St. Louis, the average turnaround time for a COVID test is more than 72 hours. And there's no hard timeline to get results. I could take a test three days before departure, but who knows when I'd get the result.Then you get into the moral issues of our current lack of testing capacity, and it seems antisocial of me to take one of a limited quantity of tests for a very unimportant reason, vacation.The more I read here, the more it seems this trip is going to be a no-go."
"Please excuse if this has been answered on another thread, I did comb through as many as I could but still have not seen an answer... We will be traveling a group of six by way of a private catamaran. Some have arrived, others arrive early next week and will be flying through SJU there and back. I fully intend to get COVID rested enroute through PR which will require a 1 night stay July 8th. We all will be returning July 18 but again may require a 1 night layover. My question is, will we need to be tested for the 1 night layover? Btw, destination is STT for our trip so traveling to and back from St Thomas Thanks in advance, I imagine there are a lot of folks with several different concerns and I, for one, appreciate the input for the local experts.Edited: 10:22 pm, June 30, 2020 "
Trying to decide if I should plan a family vacation in August. I don’t want any restrictions like curfews or beaches closed. Thank you all for your posts and updates. This has been very helpful in making a decision.
Really appreciate these updates. Thank you so much. Is the rainforest open to visitors? Are tours available to visit other islands? Hope you continue enjoying your trip.
"@Ethan E: I think if we look at the fact that the locals made huge efforts and sacrifices to prevent spreading the virus, we can understand why they want visitors to be tested. They just went through a very strict quarantine, had to be home by 7pm every night, were allowed out only for certain purposes: doctor visits, grocery shopping; were strictly monitored, and faced steep fines if they didn't follow the rules. They had it worse than we did. So it makes sense that they want to take every measure to stay safe."
"Hi, I was in PR June 24 -30, very happy with my vacation!! They take T in airport, ask where you stay and name. That is it, everything very quickly and friendly. We stayed in Isla Verde front brash hotel. Masks requested in the lobby only. Great beach, beach activities. Swimming by hours in amazing ocean. As hotels are full only 25”, it means a lot of space , fast and empty elevators in hotel, a lot of space on the beach. They take T in some restaurants, great service, friendly people. First time in PC with my husband,thank you PC for such a joy, in this strange time!!"
"I'd be happy to take a COVID test at the airport. This new literature doesn't seem to indicate one will even be offered after July 15 at the airport. One story mentioned a test at a PR lab (which doesn't sound quick). I really, really hope one is offered at the airport.The mixed messaging is frustrating. ""Come visit, but also make sure you bring something that's near-impossible to come by.""Taking a COVID test before departure seems fraught. A missed connecting flight could easily put me outside the 72-hour window, requiring another test. Just make it simple and test me at the airport."
They can take if you have a temperature.
"I arrived at SJU last evening late. The following is in place. They have tables with folks in EPP at the exits from the baggage area. They asked me my name, phone number, and flight number. They asked where was I going. I told them the City of Rio Grande. They did not ask for an address. They asked my age (a new one since college bar days- a very very long time ago). Asked for no ID. There was no temperature scan (which is being done in every bar and restaurant I have been to since). This was clearly a protocol for contact tracing, nothing more, but they have the set up to ask for COVID tests if the July 15th mandate goes through.They have also set up a large area at the baggage claim to ger a free, rapid COVID test. They say a 10-minute wait. It was totally voluntary.My best guess is that if they go through with the test mandate on the 15th is that if you don't have one they will send you there and ten minutes will be ????"
"That 10-minute airport test apparently doesn't alleviate the need to quarantine. You would still need to get a lab test on the island. No idea what the turnaround time on that would be.https:/…component-10341""Arriving travelers without this documentation will be offered a rapid COVID-19 test at the airport. Even if the test result is negative, the traveler will be required to quarantine and cover their own medical expenses/possible extended stay.The 14-day quarantine is mandated until the traveler provides proof of a negative molecular test result taken on the island.

*beginning July 15th
what kind of testing is accepted? is the print out from CVS minute clinic enough or they need some kind of official document?
"a print out should be okay. thats what i am doing, if its resulted before i even fly. just make sure its a pcr and not the viral test."
"results take 3-7 days. most places i've called, were hesitant on insuring me results were typically resulted in 3 days."
that's what i am also concerned about. most places say 5 days for results on average (most likely excluding weekends). so you can do test monday and hope results will be back wednesday. but if they aren't ready? you will have to quarantine. I think 72 hour requirement is a bit too much.

"Folks, Just came back from PR after a 4 day trip for the July 4th weekend and wanted to thank everyone on this forum for providing their insight. No tests were required at the airport except a quick temperature check. Most people were wearing masks in PR and they were taking temperature at all facilities like hotels and restaurants. Beaches were crowded and most restaurants were open in old town. For anyone travelling, just be prepared for long waits everywhere since most places are not 100% yet. Otherwise it was a real fun trip. thanks"
Thanks for the update!
@ngozi I am in the Chicago suburbs and recently took a COvid test at a CVS - they said the result time was 2-4 days at that time (it has since gone up to 5-7 on their website.) I got my result about 36 hours after the test - so quicker than expected.We are traveling to PR on July 24th - so I hope the result waiting time goes down by then.
"As for testing sites like CVS, I believe it depends on the location. There is a CVS just down the street from me here in Texas. Weeks ago I could have been tested without symptoms. Now you must be showing symptoms associated with the virus or a referral to get tested there. Now one could not test for vacation purposes. I did find some private medical offices that offer testing without referral. For example, MD Medical Group:"" Now Offering COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test – Results in 15 minutes on average, depending on clinic site:$199 for uninsured patients- office visit, rapid antigen COVID-19 test (included at no additional price), flu and strep if necessary. Prices are subject to change. Medicare, medicaid, and insurance accepted at select locations.COVID-19 PCR Test – Results in 3-7 business days.$159 for uninsured patients patients- office visit, PCR COVID-19 test (included at no additional price), flu and strep. Prices are subject to change."""
You should note that the rapid antigen test is not being accepted by PR. They are currently only accepting the PCR or molecular test.
"thank you so much randy for that information! that was actually very helpful information and will help relieve many of us travelers stress about the tests, i'm sure. I found a clinic because of your information."
"@oolalasoo please keep in mind type of test required as noted in post #98. I just quoted their complete service offered as an example of what I found in my area. Currently here in the Metroplex the need for testing is increasing along with the number of test taken. This will most likely affect the time period for results. In areas where the demand is lower, the situation is probably much different. Services offered, cost, and time periods for results will vary depending on the geographic area. Best wishes and happy travels."

"If the test is taken within 72 hours of arrival and results are not received until day 7, does that mean a 3 day quarentine once on the island until results can be submitted that were negative? I have read two completely different versions. SJ airport says that you only have to quarentine until you can submitt negative results and then also says there's an ""option"" to get tested on the island. However, Discover Puerto Rico states that showing up without negative results at time of arrival means the test must be taken ON THE ISLAND and you must submit negative results to be ""released from quarentine"". Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have called and emailed every possible agency, tourist site, airport etc but have gotten zero responses."
