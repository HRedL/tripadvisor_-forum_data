"economist demands that US sanction be lifted temporarily immediately from Venezuela, Iran and Cuba that are feeding the coronavirus worldwide epidemic it's cruel and immoral at this times the death toll is much higher then it has been due to sanctions.don't think this post will last."
"well, it should. the U.S. is not known for its generosity or ethics in times of need. remember they did not allow planes flying out of cuba to land in the U.S. in medical emergencies not too long ago. carol e.notice howw cuba is sharing their medical expertise and drs. world wide in these anxious times."

"But of course, Sideshow Don will do nothing about it. Just as he is doing nothing for the people of his own country. All he cares about is his own political reputation. He cares nothing for anyone else."
A petition asking for temporary relief permitting the sale of food and medicine to Cuba will be totally ignored as such has been permitted for the last 20 years. It will only diminish the credibility of the petitioners who display their lack of knowledge about the facts.
"A serious question: what specifically should the US do currently so far as lifting sanctions against Cuba? Which specific sanctions should be addressed? I have been trying to identify such but come up with nothing. If someone has good specific ideas, I will begin to communicate such to my elected representatives which include Senator Marco Rubio who I believe drives Cuban policy. I did encourage them not to stop flights to Cuba as was requested by the mayor of Miami. No clue how much difference I made but those flights have not been stopped."
"I tend to agree with you, Bob. This is just pissing in the wind and smells a bit like opportunism. Now if there are specific things that can be done to assist Cuba to get through this, that should be considered but it would need to be specific, temporary and narrow in scope. in order for it to be seriously considered and have any chance of success.Edited: 4:57 pm, March 21, 2020 "
There might be a lot of money to be made in supplying Cuban drugs to the US people. A Trump/Kushner company could buy and distribute them at huge mark-ups while citing this incredibly charitable action as a reason to ease some sanctions.Follow the money.
"Spunky: there are no restrictions now on the US buying Cuban pharmaceuticals. Several are going through the normal Food and Drug Administrations tests now, the same tests as US drugs are subjected to. If approved they will be available for sale in the US."
I understood that those tests were being fast tracked for drugs currently used for other ailments.
and I have contacted my member of parliament about these phony sanctions.sorry bob. I just don't agree with you in this instance.any U.S. aid has always been view with suspicion and long tentacles. and we are no better.carol e.
"Spunky: have you been listening to Donald Trump again? (insert smiley face here) That was his line a few days ago.In seriousness, once a drug has been approved for one use, it only needs to be tested to see if it has desired results for another disease if used IN THE SAME DOSAGE. If a larger dosage is required, then it must go through more safety tests at the higher dosage. I understand from my daughter in law who did clinical tests for Bristol Myers Squibb that the test to make sure a new drug did not cause other problems took longer than the tests to be sure it was helpful for the intended disease."
Bob you should ask your friend Marco what is going to take to get the embargo removed .It's over 60 years as I hate politics and politicians even more and as always it's the poor people that suffer .It's time to move on but I guess the US wòuld probably enjoy seeing the Cubans begging on there knees and even then I'm not sure they would care United Nations when they take a vote for the end of the embargo what was it 189 - 2 .As always US and Israel and of course they have now Brazil on there corner for 3 countries .As always they could not care less what other countries think And the worst part these politicians are going to die and the other ones coming in will continue with this shi$.As for signing that petition to be honest it's going straight to the garbage they could not care less and will not even look at it .
"cubacarol #13: did you reference anything current and specific in your correspondence or just vague generalizations referencing ""everybody knows""?"
"gat0 #15: I could spend an entire evening responding to your question. This is a topic I have researched quite a bit for many years. That includes communication with Senator Marco Rubio.Read the details of the 3 negotiating sessions back in the Obama era between Roberta Jacobson, then US Asst. Secretary of State and Josefina Vidal from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Analysis of those 3 sessions and what was happening in Cuba during those times will give you a very clear understanding of where the problem of resolution lies."

"Bob, if the US sanctions affecting oil shipments and/or the interventionist policies of the Helms-Burton Act and economic embargo aimed at Cuba aren't having an effect, then simple logic dictates that they should be removed. But of course, in reality, that's not the case, no matter how much you seem to always attempt to minimize the effect of that situation. In theory only, those US interventionist policies shouldn't pose a problem for Cuba - true. But of course in practice they do, because they spook the rest of the world from doing business with Cuba without the threat of potential reprisals from your hypocritical government... leading the Cuba government to inevitably pay much more to acquire what is needed for their people, or not at all.Bob, I too could spend an entire evening talking with you about this continuing immoral, cruel, and exasperating siege warfare being inflicted on Cuba. My friend, what surprises me is your continuing belief that it makes no difference. Terry"
"Kudos, Terry."
"Terry #20: do you realize those petroleum sanctions only relate to shipments from Venezuela? And Venezuela continues to ship oil to Cuba in defiance of the sanctions? Could the problem be as simple as Cuba having no money to pay any other country?I have been searching for many years for any product or service not available in Cuba because of Helms Burton. I have asked repeatedly. I find none. Is US investment in Cuba restricted by Helms Burton? We don't know because it is restricted by the Cuban government. We do know several investments were approved by the US in prior years such as the tractor factory or the 3 ferry boats but were not approved by Cuba. No US company tries any more. Many are just so sure that Helms Burton negatively impacts Cuba. After all, the Cuban government has been preaching it for decades. And everyone knows it just like everyone knew the earth was flat back in the middle ages. But can anyone give a real specific example?Many ask why the US does not simply repeal Helms Burton if it does nothing. The corollary is why should the US give it up if they get nothing in return. It is a bargaining chit for things like freedom of expression and tolerance of political distension. (Terry, I'll explain that one to you on the phone)I have met thousands who are firm in their belief that the US should end Helms Burton. But I can count on one hand the number who have actually read the law and can identify the 7 steps necessary to end it of which only 3 remain. Of those 3, one could be easily done by Cuba and the other 2 are debatable. Now I realize many here believe my position is based solely on US national pride or that I actually believe the embargo should continue. In reality, my position is to identify any remaining impacts so we can work on eliminating them individually just as was done with travel, remittances, sale of products to Cuba, purchase of pharmaceuticals from Cuba, import of Cuban tobacco for personal use, or commercial import of Cuban products from all except the Cuban government."
"Funnily enough, I can only access the actual petition website with a VPN. I doubt that it is Cuba blocking so I guess the website does not allow access from Cuba."
"""Many ask why the US does not simply repeal Helms Burton if it does nothing. The corollary is why should the US give it up if they get nothing in return. It is a bargaining chit for things like freedom of expression and tolerance of political distension.""Why? Possibly because the USA should not be trying to interfere in Cuba's policies. There are a lot of countries out there that restrict the rights of their citizens, and yet USA lets them go ahead and do it.Maybe if The USA kept their nose out of Cuba's business right from the start, then Cuba's system would have evolved differently.There is no way to prove that, of course, but the main reason for the sanctions in the first place was that the USA wanted to overthrow the ""regime."" And that for their own interests."
"Bob, I think you're missing my point... the US government needs to get their hands OFF of Cuba entirely. That's it! There's really nothing else to debate. If you're not part of that solution, than you're part of that problem. By contending that Cuba needs to meet certain criteria of the Helms-Burton act to qualify, than you are indeed still supporting your government's agenda and hypocritical tyranny on a poor defenseless people and nation.Bob, we can talk about this more later on the phone if you want - sure. I always enjoy our conversations. Call me anytime. Terry"
"American Bob know everything . He talks to his senator Fren , you know . Johnny C"
Perhaps in hindsight some in Cuba might think pointing missiles at the US was not such a good idea. Maybe not a popular opinion but food for thought.
"Schroedinger's sanctions: Utterly ineffective, and also an essential pressure tactic."
"The missiles probably weren't a good idea, And maybe the USA shouldn't have had missiles in Turkey pointed at the USSR. Between the USA hostility toward Cuba, and USSR's manipulation of the situation, it happened. It may have been that from USSR's point of view, the whole situation was more about the missiles in Turkey than it was about defending Cuba.Cuba may have just been a pawn in the cold war game between USSR and USA.The only good thing about it was that the withdrawal of the missiles in Cuba also got rid of some missiles in Turkey. At that time in history, eliminating any missiles was probably good."
"I also want to add that the Helms-Burton act also has the effect of pressuring other countries to go along with the sanctions, even if they disagree with them. And that is an attempt to interfere with the sovereignty of more countries than just Cuba."
"Even though Vietnam whupped their a$$es, politicians in San Jose, California are too smart to promise the 106,000 Vietnamese who live there, that they are going to get them their country back and kick out the commies.Vietnam was happy to receive ¾ million US tourists last year and more than pleased to ship $50 billion in goods to the US.Politics sure frigs things up."
"Can ANY entity who chooses to, trade without repercussions from the US, with Cuba?I think we know the answer to that. Bob will contend that they can. Some do and get payments through via subterfuge. Some don't think it's worth the hassle. I can't get payments through from my UK bank accounts to my Cuban bank account. It used to be possible going via 2-3 correspondent banks in Spain and sending in euros. Now, my bank can't be doing with the hassle."
Yes indeed I am pretty sure it was not Cuba's idea to point them at the US. I have traveled extensively in the US for work. Many people I have talked to do not care about Cuba one way or the other. Some say it is a bad place but don't really no why. It is really not an issue or a threat anymore and so it indeed is long overdue for a change in direction. Both countries need to suck it up and get over it Play nice and try to get along Perhaps the election coming up in the US will make a difference.
"Spunky @31, good analogy in juxtaposition to the state of affairs in Florida and their Cuban/American population. Spot on with the moral to that story and the obvious solution to help resolve the Cuba question too.Terry"
Seems pretty clear to me. The sanctions are a total waste of time and money. A high price to pay to inflate a couple of egos in Washington and Florida.
"Terry #25: It is not my contention that Cuba needs to meet certain criteria to end Helms Burton. That is US Federal law Pub.L. 104–114, 110 Stat. 785, 22 U.S.C. §§ 6021–6091. Now everyone can say it is unfair but you must acknowledge that is reality. If all you are going to do is rant on the internet and sign petitions then you can ignore that reality. It will make no difference as your efforts will accomplish nothing either way. Sadly, no one's personal views result into action. You could take action to try to have the US Congress terminate Pub.L. 104–114, 110 Stat. 785, 22 U.S.C. §§ 6021–6091. Just about everyone considers that has zero chance of success. Instead, you can to identify the remaining negative impacts and strive to eliminate them by making exemptions to Helms Burton. That has been very successful in permitting travel, remittances, and most commerce. Your statement ""if you not helping, you are hurting"" has merit in some cases. But if all you are doing is ranting on the internet and signing petitions, you are not helping at all as your efforts will cause no action. No harm either as you will be ignored. But you can help by identifying any remaining negative impacts of Helms Burton so they may be addressed. One more time, I in no way support the US actions against Cuba. I want to find a realistic achievable way to identify the negative aspects and eliminate them."

"Ratwaldo, Spunky, CJ; the Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were a direct result of the prior year's invasion at Playa Giron and continuing discussions in the US about a true military invasion. Many historical mistakes, mostly by the US, and the cold war with the USSR led to that. JFK acknowledged such to Fidel in their private communications."
There is no doubt in my mind Russia was a key player. Perhaps the US could use more JFK's and less of what you got now. But then again so could we all.
This is way better than all that covid-19 talk. History is very interesting and way back there...always debates well :)
"@40 It sure is, this thread inspired me to spend hours today refreshing my knowledge by reading up on The Bay of Pigs and The Cuban Misslie Crisis!"
"Cuba Jack #24: I am in total agreement with you that the US should have nothing to do with Cuban politics. Just as Cuba does to the US. I have communicated this to my elected officials pointing out that such would ease the existing hard feedings. Historically, the US original embargo against Cuba was an arms embargo in 1957 when the US refused to sell any more arms or military weapons to the Batista government. Batista was denied entry to the US in 1959 when he fled Cuba in spite of him having a home in Daytona Beach where he had lived for many years. The real problems with the Revolutionary government did not begin until Cuba began to nationalize US property there in 1960"
"This thread was showing as closed earlier.On that last post, Bob, a guy who I knew told me that the nationalising began with the refineries which happened because the US refused to sell oil to Cuba and the refineries refused to process oil bought from other sources. Any idea about that ?Edited: 4:12 pm, March 23, 2020 "
@43 I mentioned earlier in the thread this inspired me to refresh my memory of events in Cuba! Castro wanted the American Oil Companies (Exxon and Standard Oil) to process Russian crude so he nationalized them! This caused the US to stop buying their sugar and other products!
#39... accuracy.... wasn't Russia... was USSR. 2 differing things

"beardo #43: I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. I thought the first ripple was when the US backed off buying the sugar quota and the USSR stepped up for that. However, that may have not been the first step but a reaction to an earlier one. I guess the date of when the fecal matter really hit the air movement device is a subjective one."
How about when Fidel Got Bent Over By Both of them! SalúD!
"According to the majority here, the Cubans are rich people who don’t need anything. Read any gifting thread to see it for yourself. So which is it then? Why complain about sanctions when they are with Nike, ipads and iphones and don’t need anything from a kind hearted tourist wanting to help on any level?"
Both. But I am pretty sure you already know that. Small town Cuba has many worthy of help. Would never ask for it and sometimes will not even take it. These are the people that may benefit the most. Topping up a cell phone is a person not in need just in greed. The farmers are farming with oxen because they can't get any fuel for their tractor. If removing the sanctions will help them I am all for it.
