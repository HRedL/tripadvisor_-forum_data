"""pressures are suffocating' that does not bode well for this whole process."
">>We want tourists, but without Covid. <<That is the most important sentence. And rightly so."
"All countries, cities etc. want ""tourists without covid"" but given the nature of this virus including transmission rates and asymptomatic spread I don't know how this will happen?"
Looks like Greece may have to rethink its policy for when things really get busy. The current measures are just not practical to cope with the volume of people.
"They want MONEY, without COVID; too simple"
@5 !!! So true.
"#5 - from the above report, the way they are going about things I think their hopes are likely to be dashed on both counts."
Reading that report it suggests that there is no air conditioning in Heraklion airport? If that's true I really am happy not to be travelling this year.
"Said on here quite a few times now, Greece are ONLY after it's Visitors MONEY and after reading that Report, Not Surprised, with it's Complete indifference, to it's ""Customers"" Holiday Plans. Starting with extremely Disorganized and overcrowded Airports, that's some, so called Welcome, this has to change pretty Quick, or their will be even More Cancellations."
"Keitht, air conditioning spreads the virus around so is a bad idea in public spaces. But yes, the airport must be unbearable without it. Yet another reason I won’t be travelling this year."
"Can remember siting in Heraklion airport June last year heading to Munich via Athens . Looking out at the Ocean. Planes coming and going . Every one happy and cheerful .Weather magnificent. Amazing what a can happen in a year. robfiorelli and DarkBlueDundee one thing is you have to understand is that the Greek government were under enormous pressure not to close Greece down. Now they are most probably under the same pressure to open up again.,externally and internally Now looking at the situation , there is really nothing amazing here , the same scenario is being played out every where else in the world."
"I think the Governments of all locations with a heavy reliance on tourism are between the rocks and a hard place. Whatever they do, or refuse to do, will be the wrong decision for some people."
"Not too sure these restrictions will only be in place this year, as according to the recent Lancet report this week, hurd immunity is not working so the only way forward now is a vaccine.We all know the odds of creating a vaccine is very low.I guess is these restrictions are here for quite a few years to come."
Only time will tell. Knowledge of how this virus acts is increasing all the time. Finding a medication which will reduce the effect may come before a vaccine.
"@13 you may be right on the vaccine but I would not say ""we all know"" because we really don't know...we don't know much of anything when it comes to what is going on with the clinical trials...there has never been this much money and effort thrown into developing a vaccine...while i know nothing I am still hopeful that there will be a break..without that hope and many more months ahead here in US with surging numbers and winter still to come with everyone indoors in so many states...well about all we have now is hope. But that said travel is changed I think forever and frankly some of the precautions on planes etc. will be welcome. Planes have always been super spreaders...Edited: 9:22 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Gene,I wrote 'we all know'... because unfortunately we have never been able to created a vaccine for any previous Covid disease, so the odds of creating one now are low.There may never be returning to normal.....it will be the ''New Normal''.As for you in the USA, with over 61,000 new cases yesterday, its out of control - maybe opening up the lockdown far to early was the cause?I do remember Dr Fauci saying...''we dont want to see spikes as that will indicate its out of control'' And unfortunately that's what you have now in the states.I hope things improve quickly for you over the pond!!!!Edited: 10:06 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Is the situation in Heraclion airport so bad? We are going to Crete on July 19 with our 5 year old daughter. I wonder how long time it will take from arrival to airport exit without air conditioning? Is it very hot at the airport, or there are a lot of people queuing for the test?"
"@16 yep here ""across the pond"" is in fact out of control...states with the surges refuse to shut down again...people from those states moving freely all over the country (except NE which has put some limits on) and this is all wave 1!!"
Was it ever under control? Trump has consistently down played the risk that the virus poses. First it will all be over by Easter and it was not. Now the country has reopened too quickly and from what I can see there ambivalence towards social distancing as well as face coverings. Many Americans are refusing to follow collective responsibility with this and compare this advice to the nanny state. Also i have seen mass gathering for election campaigns and the 4th July almost as if the pandemic was not happening. Over here these things are officially banned although some demonstrations and mass gatherings have occurred but people followed social distancing. I am hoping to revisit the States next summer but American needs to get its act together before Christmas for me to feel that it is safe to revisit.  But we are discussing entry into Crete at Heraklion rather than the general world situation.
@19 simple answer no it was never under control...from the start.
">I think the Governments of all locations with a heavy reliance on tourism are between the rocks and a hard place. Whatever they do, or refuse to do, will be the wrong decision for some people.<That is so well and succinctly put, Keith. It's true of governments of all countries, whether or not reliant on tourism. The prioritisation dilemma - do we go for health and life or for the economy - is a false dichotomy: they're interdependent.The reality is, the pandemic has us all in a hard place right now."
#21No economy = no health service or at the least a potentially very diminished one with all the implications that throws on deaths from a multitude of other diseases / causes it could be argued .
"Well put Alabastron. I think there are a few false prophets on TA who some how think that they have to holiday in Greece and some how this will save the economy. I even read here that ""Greece needs us more than we need them."" If people are so concerned , just donate money to Greece, and stop pretending that a holiday in Greece is anything other than a selfish pass time whim which these days has a lot of chances , and uncertainties attached.Edited: 3:29 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"I don't think it are false prophets but desperate people who are thinking how to survive without income. Being healthy is worth everything but be healthy without money for nearly a year is hard. If you live in a country with almost no death and sick people it might be hard to understand why people with sense of responsibility (yes, there are!) will not come to your beautiful country/island. Keep distance, wash hands, use masks when needed, avoid crowds and be happy at Crete!"
"truus not every one that lives in Greece is in the tourist Industry. Maybe that gives you a idea.There are people doing just fine in Greece with no reliance on tourism what so ever . To them whether tourist come to Greece or not is irrelevant do not they deserve to be safe and Covid free.???Edited: 8:34 am, July 10, 2020 "
"Yes they do comet27 and when the tourist behavior is responsible (keep distance etc) they will be safe as possible. No one can guarantee a COVID19 free live. But don't all those working in the tourist industry (a quarter of all jobs) deserve an income to survive? It's easy to talk living in a prosperous, social and rich country you and I live. A lot of workers in the tourist industry are young and don't have savings. All the costs will continue.You are ""talking"" about false prophets, do you really believe a person will do this with mentioning his name and the name of his restaurant when it won't be the truth? This is making me angry, why don't you trust people? When one person is honest more will follow, they have their proud but it's easier to be honest when you know you aren't alone. I realize this is a difficult discussion with no winners. Let's pray Greece is doing the best possible thing: stay safe as possible with some prospect of a future. As mentioned before: stay home if your feelings are not OK to go and feel free to go if they are. Of course with all the necessary precautionary measures."
"Greece no different to UK when it comes to gatherings, https:/…"
@Comet27 Your 'selfish pass time whim' comment is offensive. I've worked without a break since last September and been on the front line as far as Covid is concerned. I've obeyed all our government instructions and will obey all those laid down by the Greek government when I arrive in Crete. I accept there is a risk I may be quarantined and will not complain if I am. My wife and I missed our honeymoon because of Covid and I was unable to attend my stepfather's funeral or bid him goodbye for the same reason. Keep your shaming comments for people who break the rules.
Wichhazel14 you are so right! I wish you a fantastic and well deserved holiday at Crete! Hope you will come back rested.
Thank you and have a great summer.

"Comet, for the link to work, you'll need to re-post it leaving a space between the ?? and https.Edited: 1:19 am, July 11, 2020 "
"Thanks for the link Comet.Greece is hoping not to go into lockdown, according to official reports in the Greek press.The change at the land border, now requiring people entering there to have taken a negative test in the previous 3 days, should reduce the number of new cases.This weekend, teams are checking on the mainland & islands that bars, clubs etc are sticking to the restrictions, & they will be imposing fines where necessary.There could be some local lock-downs if needed, if hot-spots develop, but it's unlikely to be a total shut down.So far, luckily few cases in Crete"
Just mentioning again that post 28 on this thread is well worth a read.
"Thanks for the link Comet, and your post SteveSitia ....it’s good to know that the Greeks are acting quickly and let’s hope the cases start to reduce"
"I would suggest if you want to find out reasonably accurate information on the situation in Greece, the Daily Mail would be one of the last places to look. Try www.ekathimerini.com"
"Indeed, Richard. Same info in these 2 ekathimerini reports:https://www.ekathimerini.com/254603/article/…https://www.ekathimerini.com/254590/article/…"
Haha Richard I think a lot of people probably thought the same when they saw the words Daily Mail :-)
Thank Steve for the additional links
"Thanks Steve that all sounds sensible, not a national lockdown!"
"Apologies every one I did not realise that certain members on this thread have privy to more accurate and up to date information than the press.I cant see much difference in both articles ,The Daily mail and .Ekathimerini. seem to be saying the exactly same thing .Could some one advise what the difference is please.Edited: 7:03 am, July 11, 2020 "
"I can't speak about the press, or media in general, in other countries but in the UK they aren't noted for underplaying any situation. One person stung by a bee can develop into ""Killers bees on the rampage"" in a very short time. Possibly a slight exaggeration, but you'll understand what I mean."
There will be no national lock down on any country. Very big slump for the economy
"True about the Daily Fail, Yiassas, and I would be the last person on earth to defend its editorial policies, but its reporting isn't always wrong, and in this case Richard J's reaction is the knee-jerk one. So was mine at first, but when I read the piece I saw it contained useful information, which is why I suggested to Comet that s/he re-post it.Edited: 10:27 am, July 11, 2020 "

I had confirmation from a TA mod that it does take more than one person reporting a post to get it removed.TA will not say how many reports are required.
HI every one we are all adults here. If a link is posted to a article or some ones photos it is up to us to decide what we believe. Now it seems that there are a number of cases being imported into Greece at the moment .Thats the ones we know about. So I read that a good day in Greece is if there are less cases imported and reported than the day before. So if one Monday there are 60 cases imported and detected and the Tuesday there are 59 cases detected then Tuesday is a good day. Strange maths as there are a total 119 cases in total.
"#51 The Daily Fail states Greece on the verge of another lockdown, obviously not true and typical of their reporting."
"comet27, the problem with using stats is that although the raw data provided may well be correct, it's the way they are interpreted which can create the problems. As an example, the area where I live was declared on one day to be high risk due to a 200% increase in Covid19 deaths. On the face of it, 200% increase would seem to be extremely worrying. Drill down and you discover the increase in numbers had been from 1 death to 3 deaths. It was also a one off.According to those stats, my area was higher risk than Leicester which had been put into lockdown due to many dozens of cases, and increasing daily. The way the stats were being used, a death increase from 100 to 110 would be lower risk than 1 to 2, because they were using percentages. (Please note the 100 to 110 is not related to Leicester).It just proves the old adage ""Lie, damn lies and statistics"""

"We flew from Copenhagen with transit in Frankfurt (Lufthansa). I am not sure how many were tested, as we who were not selected could just move on. But 5 people were in line to be tested when we left, so my estimate is 5-10%."
