"What is the garbage situation like on the Amalfi Coast? Specifically Positano, and Capri. I will be there at the beginning of July. i am going to try and avoid Naples and take the Marozzi bus line from Rome to Amalfi or Sorrento. Also does anyone know when, the tie, the Marozzi bus leave the Amalfi coast to go back to Rome? I'm thinking about revising my trip and go to Vernazza instead. Any advice?"
"Hello, Nadij.I think that the info that newspapers and tv are giving about ""garbage crisis"" is really misleading.People who live on the Amalfi Coast and tourists who're here in this period are seeing with their own eyes there is no problem to talk about here.The problem interests only Naples area.With reference to your question, there is a bus leaving Amalfi and going to Rome Tiburtina at 15:25.In alternative, you can take it from Sorrento at 6.00 or 17:00 .Ciao,Emiliano."
There is trashed piled high in the streets. The ocean also has garbage floating about. I would seriously reconsider your travel plans. It is a long way to go to get dirty. The only way the problem will be solved is if the Amalfi coast is boycotted until the residents do whatever they need to do to clean up.
"Hyalauron, where did you go. The garbage problem is affecting the poorer parts of Naples only. The amalfi coast, capri, and the Posher parts of Napoli do not have a problem.You are right in saying that action needs to be taken, i.e. obbligatory recycling, and on the spot fines for littering, but at the moment the coast is clean."
" As giorav mentioned the problem originates in Napoli and has bled over to its own province, particularly to its less tourist-frequented suburbs. Nevertheless, I think it'd take an agency or a team of agencies like the Guardia Costiera and a group working for the Region to assess first-hand the effects of the Napoli garbage situation on the entire Costiera Amalfitana which includes coves/caves/stretches of practically inaccessible beaches reachable by boat or hundreds of stair steps not to mention the inland areas running sometimes parallel such as the many towns such as Scala, Furore, and the hundreds of frazioni/suburbs such as Montepertuso, Raito, and Monte Brusara. Even that overseas news article didn't sift thoroughly through the facts (no quotes, anecdotes, or even pictures from anone/anywhere in the Costiera in question) correctly IMHO regarding trash ""washing up onto the Costiera Amalfitana."" Buona Fortuna..."
"thank you for posting this topic, I had no idea about this problem. However, i just googled it and omg this sounds very serious from major news sources. I don't think I want to go to Positano in July. Can someone please keep us posted on the garbage situation. Yuck dirty diapers in the water"
"The Amalfi Coast is not having garbage problems. Positano, Ravello, Amalfi, Scala and other areas of the coast are clean and do not have any problems.Here in Ravello the Rubbish is collected daily."
From what I read in Newsweek Magazine trash including soiled diapers are appearing on the shores of Capri & Positano. Additinally the U.S. has issued a travel advisory for the entire Amalfi area for health concerns. 
"well I live here and I can assure you that the Amalfi Coast is clean. News reports tend to exaggerate things, such as the BIrd Flu ""epidemic"".The Amalfi Coast is not affected by this problem. The region would loose too much money if it was."
"The only rubbish I have come across is the posts saying that rubbish is a problem! We stayed in Ravello, Sorrento and Naples and visited Positano and Amalfi many times and not once did we see any litter or garbage either in the streets or in the sea. My 10 year old bathed in the sea at both Amalfi, Sorrento and Positano and I did not see one item of rubbish there. Whatever the problem is it does not affect the thousands visiting this lovely area and most certainly does not warrant anyone cancelling holidays, etc. It would not be the first and only time new agencies overexacerated stories from my experience!!!!"
"No rubbish,no Crisis,no story"
Having just returned from my anual Bay of Naples 'Fix' what is all this about the Garbage. I have Motor Biked From Naples To Solerno and have found it no diferenentece my 40 years of exploring this wonderful coast line. However haveing had a week of watching 'Fox TV' while in Sorrento I can fully understand the paranoia of sanatised USA. There is no problem! what do the visitor from the USA want? disifectant wipes on every street corner? Get a gripp and enjoy the Bay of Naples and if you are scared of a moscito bite stay at home & catch malaria in a New York park.
"I just returned from the Amalfi coast. Only Naples is affected by the garbage problem. I was in Ravello, Capri, Positano, and Amalfi and there are no problems as of end of May 07. Naples, on the other hand, had garbage piled all over near the train station. "
"Mike, your comments about Americans are rather rude and really uncalled for. If you were paying attention to what is going on in the region, you would know that garbage collection (or the lack of it, I should say) in Naples and the immediately surrounding areas has been a particularly bad problem recently. The people who live there are very upset about the lack of a solution. You can read about it the Naples forum.But from what I hear, it's having little or no impact on the Amalfi coast towns."
" I was at Napoli Centrale FS Train Station last week and there were no huge mounting piles of garbage near the big city square receptacle bins. However, in areas and suburbs outside of Napoli such as Casoria, Afragola, and the outskirts of the Vesuviane cities such as Torre Annunziata and Terzigno, the problem is more pronounced:www.telecaprinews.it/leggi.asp?cod=7702"
"Mike obviously has a chip on his shoulder. Obviously there is an problem otherwise there would not be postings on this topic. Sorry, Mike most people dont go on an expensive vacation to be exposed to mountains of garbage. I think this is just a case of another person not liking the U.S.. Get over it."
"Just back a week ago. Caserta to Salerno, all the towns & villages no problem no garbage apart from the litter being dropped by tourists. Has this story been put about by people who think the Bay of Naples is being overrun by visitors from the USA and they want to put them off coming?"
"Hi, I am just back from a holiday on the Amalfi coast last week. We travelled around Positano, Sorrento, Amalfi and Ravello and there is no 'garbage crisis'! It's spectacularly clean, and I would wholeheartedly recommend going there on holiday. I really don't know where that garbage story came from, but it really is garbage!!"
"Just returned from an excellent two week holiday in Ravello (Villa Casale). We were very impressed with the garbage recycling arrangements - far more differentiation between types than we are used to back here in UK. We visited Amalfi, Minori, Positano and Sorrento and were not aware of any problems with garbage disposal. We did hear about the problems with sewage disposal in the Positano area but did not encounter any problems as we did not swim in the sea. THere is a lot of roadside litter which seems to have been there forever. What is needed is an Italaian eqwuivalent of the ""keep Britain Tidy"" campaign, but that`s a very British thing and might not appeal to the Latin temperament.."
"You-all might want to look again, I was just in Ravello, Amalfi and Naples and the garbage crisis is rearing it's ugly head again, I saw hypodermics washed up on the shore in Sorrento and the suburbs of Napoli are getting trash mountains again. Unfortunately, the pristine tourist spots are affected by what happens in the 'poor' parts of Naples because the garbage has to go somewhere when the Mafia (Camorra) don't pick it up, and inevitably some of it ends up getting dumped in the ocean."
" As of last week, the garbage problem hit Sorrento so now the garbage is getting picked up every 3 days instead of everyday. Residents don't know when the problem will be resolved, however, practially everyone in the province of Napoli knows it'll be sometime soon as Sorrento is a huge tourist destination. The garbage problem IMHO has hit hardest the province of Avellino:www.telecaprinews.it/leggi.asp?cod=9182 I was in Pompei a week ago and didn't see any mountains of garbage, and on Monday in downtown Napoli (Piazza Garibaldi, Piazza Municipio, Varco Immacolatella, Borgo degli Orefici off Corso Umerto, Piazza Borsa) no garbage piles were to be seen. Last week, some striking workers did dump and set on fire some garbage near Porta Nolana.  Amalfi and Positano remain unaffected by the garbage problem in that their garbage is being picked up routinely as usual. Ravello is probably unaffected by the garbage problem. In downtown Salerno, the garbage problem hasn't hit. Bassolino (president of the Region) and Iervolino (Mayor of Napoli) found €750,000,000 (meant for finding a solution to the garbage problem a long time ago) in their pockets. Best of all, when confronted with the contract he signed with the Camorra which landed him a portion of all that cash, Bassolino said that he didn't read what he signed. Recently, La Iena (popular sometimes undercover journalistic tv show) quoted Bassolino on camera regarding the garbage problem so who knows?www.ilmattino.it/mattino/view.php…Buona Fortuna..."
I am thinking of going to the amalfi coast in April is there any problem with the rublish now?? Thanks
"There is still no problems on the Amalfi Coast, not sure about Sorrento, but there are still problems in Naples.All towns on the Amalfi Coast have started recycling, and garage is collected everyday.The streets are swept regularly and thats it really.As always you will get the idiot who decides to throw a washing machine or fridge down a mountainside, because they cannot be bothered to make a phone call to arrange collection of the item, but apart from that, the towns themselves are kept very clean."
Thanks for that information. Can you give me any idea of where it would general be chilly or warm on the Amalfi coast at begining of April.Thanks
"At the moment it is quite cold. In April the weather can be fickle with warm sunshine one day and cold wind the next. Be prepared for anything. In any case you will need something warm on in the evenings. There is no rubbish (on the streets at Positano), came back yesterday !"
"Amalfi coast is superclean nowadays. As they mentioned posts before, it is in Neaples surroundings, but do not worry in July is no problem at all. they must resolve the problem before Eastern. Another option is a train to Salerno www.trenitalia.comAmalfi coast nicer than Vernazza."

"I have been living on the Amalfi Coast for the last 5 months and I can assure you there is no garbage problem on the Amalfi coast or Capri. This winter there was a problem in Naples, but the Amalfi Coast garbage has been always been collected normally because it is under the jurisdiction of Salerno not Naples. They are two different cities with seperate garbage collection. The sea is clean too, I went swimming yesterday :-) If you want to avoid going through Naples, you can take a direct train from Rome to Salerno, and from there find a SITA bus that will take you to Amalfi."
