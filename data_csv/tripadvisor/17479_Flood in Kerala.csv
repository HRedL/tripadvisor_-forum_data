"Hello all I planned to make a kerala trip on 24 th August 2018, and visit places like munnar thekaddy kovalam but I am confused,will it be safe to visit kerala in this flood. If I cancel my flight, it will be a total waste as I wont get any refund. Please advice"
It probably will turn out fine by 24th. Even if you cannot make it to munnar on 24th you can consider other places like kumarakom or varkala
Is kovalam fine?? or there is there any flood reports??
I believe that by 20 th the road conditions would improve. You would be able to travel to hill stations as well.No floods in Kovalam Trivandrum Alleppey Kumarakom.Suresh P R
Don't travel to Kerala. Munnar is completely cut off from the rest of the state. Roads are destroyed. The rain will hopefully stop in the next few days but infrastructure has taken a beating
"It is best suggested that you postpone your trip as heavy rains are forecasted due to cyclonic storms. The entire Kerala State is on red alert and the many places you are planning to travel is cut off from roads and communication. By the time you arrive weather may improve, but the after effects will be there and it will take time to get back to normalcy."
"Hello,Rains are slated to decrease by tomorrow. However, the infrastructure is totally destroyed and water has inundated lot of places. It will take a lot of time for things to get back to normal. Water contamination and other diseases cannot be ruled out. Wait for the government`s info and then continue."
Don't go as all tourist spots were destroyed. Very bad situation over there nothing will be good before 6 months. Airport closed till 26 Aug.Avoid kerala
Above all you will find sadness all around. The true face of ‘God’s own country ‘ will be missing. Give Kerala a miss for now and come back when things are back to normal.
"Hello,We have a trip planned in the south of Kerala, below Kovalam and our hotel told us everything was ok in the south.We are supposed to take off on August 29th to Trivandrum. We can keep in touch if one of us has more information.BRAngieEdited: 2 years ago "
I was on holiday in Kochi and got evacuated. It has been a crazy 3 days and am now safely back in Singapore. Even Kochi Marriott's basement got flooded a few hours after I decided to leave and got to Trivandrum to get out. Kochi airport is closed until 26 Aug. You will be able to get your refund as the situation in Kerala is very bad. It is not advisable for you to travel there.
HiKeep me updated. We are going south too in 3 weeks to Poovar landing at Trivandrum . Thanks
"Had an update from friends in Trivandrum this morning, Amanda. They said heavy rain with some localized flooding but none of the devastation seen in central and northern Kerala. Probably a clearer picture after this weekend."
Please avoid as there is nothing to see before 6 months as there is a huge disaster to all infrastructure.And after floods there might be possibility of spreading diseases.
There are no roads left to travel to munnar. How it become accessible. It will take time to build new roads and for tourist nothing to see as all tea plantation and other infrastructure is destroyed.
Avoid keralaHoteliers will not tell you the truth the people are facing over in Kerala.Condition is pathetic over here.
"We are due to travel to Kerala, Kovalam in September (end of), should we cancel this trip?"
Thank you @wanderin_star
Traveling to Kovalam is ok as Trivandrum is largely unaffected by these floods.
"I'm in same situation too..i've a trip planned from 12-16 sept,2018 for kanyakumari, trivandrum,rameshwaram,madurai..all the bookings done..very confused..people, pls advice"
"HiTrivandrum - Kanyakumari - Rameshwaram - Madurai traveling is fine during Sep 2018.As the rains have stopped, traveling to other parts of Kerala should also be fine. Consider the situations after this week, if you have plans of visiting Kerala.RegardsSam"
Trivandrum if fine and airport is functional. The south of Kerala is not affected.
We are also going there in 22 sept. Very confused now.should we go to kerala or not. Please give some suggestion
"Is travelling to Varkala in second week of September advisable or should I come back some months later. Reservation is all done, but I want to see Kerala in all its glory."
"The aviation people know the situation.Please call them up ,they will be willing to cancel or make changes to your date.please go after a month or so.As there will be fear of epidemic after the floods."
"Hi!I have my tickets and hotels booked for Munnar, Thekkady and Alappuzha in the 2nd week of September (9th to 13th).Please suggest whether it is safe to visit these places or should I plan another destination?Please suggest alternate destinations also."
Kochi airport is closed until the 26th August
"Hi Manodip,The best thing to do is to to spend your vacation in South Kerala, places like Kovalam/Trivandrum and even Kanyakumari can be visited during your Kerala trip."
Please postpone your plan. Dont travel to kerala now. Better to plan after 3 months
I assume the railway network has been closed down?

"I understand some of these bookings are non-refundable. But guys, please don't undermine the after-flood effects. History tells you that every state (Mumbai, Surat, Uttarakhand) has had epidemic immediately after the flood. These news do not come in TVs, but you may ask your local friends. Hotels and Travel agencies will of course say everything is back to normal as they have to make up for the loss they suffer. But your health/life is more important. Personally I would have avoided visiting Kerala for 5-6 months after the flood."
I daresay the public boat operating from Kollam to Appelley is not running.
BiriyaniVery wise words. Also it is extremely important to check one's own countries' Foreign office policy for the region.If they advise against travel and one decides to go -it then invalidates ones Travel insurance. It's all in the small print of policies.
I am travelling to Kovalum on the 1st September for an Ayurveda kur. I was informed that the floods were not in this area. Does anyone know the facts?
"There is previous thread, SalzburgVroni.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g297…"
Trivandrum city and kovalam is relatively unaffected. No problems

What about if traveling in September 28 onwards.
You can't even think to come to Kerala. It is a huge flood here. the state is the whole country is fighting this mishap. This is really sad and pathetic.
"Sir I will plan Kerala trip in October last week. Munnar, thekkedy n alleppey... Sir plz tell me October last week is Good or not......"
Good and safe
You are simply misguiding people in trip advisor. I have seen your comment at many places and seeing you are even suggesting people to come during August. I believe you might be connected with some travel agency and that's why not suggesting right options.
"My friend who lives in vakala days it’s fine there , hope this helps"
"Alleppey: Houseboats are not yet in operation. Now, the priority is to clean the affected houses near the backwaters and bring back the families. A large scale cleaning work is going on. Many houses are damaged. It would take some more days for the houseboat torusim to be in a normal state in ALleppey.Kumarakom: The roads are clean now. Resorts were affected with raising water. The normal life would be back in Kumarakom in a few days.Munnar: A lot of efforts are going on to clean the city, to make the roads better and bring back normal life to Munnar. Bus service from Kochi to Munnar is operational. Neelakurinji flowered in Munnar. You can expect Munnar ready for visitors in a few days.Suresh P R"

"We are travelling to Kerala in late October, do you all consider the holiday will be a successful trip?"
October will be okay if you are ready to accept bad roads at certain spots due to damage from flooding. If you can postpone your trip to early next year that will be best.
HelloI am worried about the same thing. We have a planned visit late October. Because of all the horrendous damage I'm really worried about it. We will definitely lose our money if we cancel.Any advice out there as I can't find any travel advice and our travel company has said this area has not been affected?!!!
Please someone tell me about December 2nd week. Will it be safe that time ?
"Dear sir ,We are Down, but not Out. Our land has been ravaged; Our people are in shock. Our life and dreams have been hit, but in spirits we are recharged. We have seen lives and property vanish before our very eyes. We have seen the magical beauty of Kerala getting scarred. But our resilience just got better.The Keralite has built societies in all parts of the world. The Keralite will now rebuild the state. Hard work has never been alien to us. Our resolve to come out of this shock has become stronger. While the restoration of our state is our target, getting our infrastructure in place and people back in their homes is our priority. Bringing smiles back on is our dream. The airport is closed, but we are worked overtime to be ready for your flights by the 26th of August 2018.The businesses which are now shut will be up and running by the 05st of September 2018.How can you be a part of this history - rebuilding of Kerala?Comfort us by visiting kerala. Support us by trusting our instincts about our land. Be a part of our resurgence, be a part of new Kerala. You can help Kerala get back on its feet faster.

"Sarah HYour question is not clear to me. However, by late October, we can assume that all tourist activities would be active in all places. Munnar is recovering despite road connectivity issues to Rajamala. How is your itinerary ?Suresh P R. Palmland Tours"
Could you pl advise if it is safe to travel in Kerala ...My travel dates are 4-8 oct
"Hi Garry, Kerala is absolutely safe to travel, all tourism activities had resumed in full and tourists are confident of that due to ground zero reports & testimonials. Regards"
"I have a trip planned to Kerala, Cochi, for January/February 2019. Everyone says don't go and I have not heard from my Heritage Homestay. But I really want to go and I am sure the area will need tourists. Your advice would be helpful"
"Hi can anyone advise on if it is safe to travel down to Alleppey, Kochi and Varkala from Goa? Are tourist attractions open - I.e houseboats on backwaters of Kerela? I am unsure whether to travel there at this time or whether to stay in Goa. I would plan to travel by train or bus. Thanks"
"HiYellow alert is in place for most parts of Kerala till 08 th Oct, that means one should stay aware and plan the travels accordingly, as the weather might take a bad turn. All tourist destinations viz Kochi, Munnar, Kumarakom, Vagamon, Alleppey, Varkala & Kovalam are open. Tourist attractions & activities like Houseboats in Kerala Backwaters are also functional.
