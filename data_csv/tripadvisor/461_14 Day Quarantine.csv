"Has anyone done the 14 day quarantine at home and what steps are being taken to ensure that people stay home and quarantine? In NYC , we have a 14 day quarantine for 35 states but it's not being enforced and more of an honor system as far as I know from experience.Are Ecuadorian authorities using smartphones and other surveillance techniques to enforce quarantine and alert authorities if people try to be irresponsible?Thanks for any information...."
Are you a citizen or a resident?
We are both. I am USA my spouse is Ecuadorian. In my country the quarantine is not followed through. I’m wondering how they do it in Ecuador. Of course when you are in a hotel it’s easy to keep track of guests and in Europe the hotel owners and innkeepers are required to report all guest information to the authorities. So I’m wondering how they handle it in Ecuador. Thank you for your comment and reply.
"Non-residents have to quarantine in specific hotels. (I assume you would be treated as a resident if you are traveling with your wife, but if you are arriving alone, you will probably be considered non-resident.) You aren't allowed to leave your room for the first 7 days at least, and the hotel is obliged to follow a reporting system for visitors who break the quarantine or show symptoms, but I don't know the exact details.For residents/citizens, it's laxer. They do send the police to check on people, but mostly they are relying on good behaviour, or neighbours reporting them, which seems to happen fairly frequently, including false reports. I know a local family on the coast who were sick and tested positive. The neighbours wouldn't even let them leave to buy medicine, and the municipality sent army guys to 'protect' them, but mainly to make sure they didn't leave the house."
"Thanks for the reply!Ecuador is the only country I know of which has an Instant Message system on the Guayaquil Airport website, set up in Spanish or English to ask questions about flights and covid measures. They told me that with a marriage certificate I will be able to quarantine with my spouse at home.I was just wondering how they enforce it. It sounds a bit unregulated but working. I didn't understand how they really enforce quarantines at home. I can understand how neighbors would get involved. Especially in the gated condos and communities where security guards are watching and know what's going on. Still, it seems a bit overkill to me to treat everyone the same way. If people come into the country with a negative PCR test why should they undergo the same treatment as those with a positive test? And for those who aren't citizens or residents, I'm bewildered as to why people would spend as much as 14 days in a hotel at their expense. It's described more like jail than a vacation. In my personal opinion, these rules are wonderful but should be adapted according to the situation rather than similar treatment across the board for everyone. If someone on the plane shows a positive virus with a fever, etc, I can understand asking the entire plan to quarantine. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense to me...but....I was just wondering how it's handled and I thank you for your kind input!StevenEdited: 2:45 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"The medical system in Quito is currently on the verge of being overwhelmed. Guayaquil was absolutely battered by it. I doubt they have the manpower or infrastructure to develop anything more nuanced. Possibly, it's also in part to discourage people from travelling, but that's just my speculation.I also have no idea why people are currently traveling here for vacations. I understand going through the process if you are trying to get home or have family here, but for a holiday? It wouldn't be my choice.Anyway, I hope your trip goes smoothly. Good luck!Edited: 3:29 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"Thank you ver much!Yes, I heard that Cynthia Viteri is bringing Covid patients from Quito to Guayaquil for care since Quito is so overwhelmed. That doesn't seem to go over well with some but, I feel it's the right thing to do. I'm sure they will be transported and cared for without risk of infecting others and if the beds and experience is available, why not help others?We will plan our trip once we ""can"" visit family. I wish it could be sooner than later but - under present conditions there would be no ability to visit anyway.Take care!StevenEdited: 3:50 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"Cynthia Viteri, the mayor of Guayaquil is an amazing woman, she donated a lot of medical supplies to Quito last week and she sent a few doctors to fight COVID-19 in Quito.Guayaquil has dicreased dramaticaly its COVID-19 ratesLet's hope that the quarantine for travellers to Ecuador will be over by September.Saludos cordiales,Dennis Yepez"
"Hi Dennis,Yes. I agree!! She's very strong!! ""Fuerte""!!I met her at Bolon de Tere Cafe at Garzota just before the election. She couldn't have been more kind and attentive to me as a foreigner. We shook hands and spoke in English. I find her to be both a politician and a leader. Guayaquil, I think, is lucky to have her and I'm sure she will continue to do great things for Ecuador!!Thanks for your comment!Steven"
"Dear Steven,Definitely Cynthia is very fuerte. Guayaquil went trough a very hard time during March-April and May, the COVID death toll was really high but now everything is under control.You are welcome Steven!Saludos cordiales,Dennis Yepez"
"Now that the quarantine is lifted we leave on Monday for a month in Guayaquil! We're looking forward to our stay, we have our negative PCR tests and paperwork and hopefully will have a non-eventful trip without too much hassles.Best regards,Steven"
