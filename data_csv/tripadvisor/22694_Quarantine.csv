"I read this today online The UK’s travel advice is due to be ‘reviewed’ on July 27, though efforts underway are focused on changing the situation for visiting Brits even sooner."
"Portugal s number of new cases is not falling, it is just under 300 an increase from Monday's.Not the news those hoping for a change in the UKs travel advice are hoping to hear."
This sort of mistake from the BBC does not help either .https:/…

"Portugal will soon become a no go zone if the statistics are interpreted without background. As in UK, it's different in different regions but it's easier for governments and others to treat everything as one.Why not go back to a complete travel ban for a year until the virus goes away or everyone can be vaccinated? Travel bans worked during the Black Death. The fact though that decades of economic and social breakdown followed is perhaps not lost on present governments.All this chopping and changing will not help anyone, whether for better or worse. People cannot plan holidays at 5 minutes notice. The media speculation is not helping either. Facts are few.No holiday this year for many unless it's a day out Skegness. or Morecambe."
"Having taken the decision to cancel the next month's visit to the Algarve on Monday, I tend to agree Cubsur. This was all booked pre-Covid and I've been through various stages of optimism since the Pandemic started, from we are definitely not going back in April to we almost certainly are going at end of May. The constant change of messaging helps no one, on a positive note my accommodation has moved the booking to next August with no issues and I received my British Airways voucher with 3 minutes of applying for it. I don't see the situation changing anytime soon for future visits."

You can see the numbers of confirmed & deaths in specific local areas in url below (updated daily) As you can see there have been very few cases in Algarve - eg Albufeira is 125 (compare with UK !!)I would be more concerned about taking covid TO Portugal rather than catching it there....https:/…
"Any458 Wait until the local summer holidays, not long off now for the Lisbonites and others up North where there is a spike in infections decend on the Algarve in great numbers.  BTW if some areas of Lisbon and their municipalities are now supposedly on lockdown, will they be allowed to travel. Of course they will.  Personally I'd sooner stay at home in the UK and be sensible until later on in the year or maybe next year.. Economy or not, health is more important to me.Edited: 5:50 pm, July 09, 2020 "
