"New York, New Jersey and Connecticut impose 14-day quarantine on travelers from coronavirus hotspot statesArticle continueshttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/24/new-york-new…Edited: 11:53 pm, June 24, 2020 "
Thanks for the vague title lol.This does not apply to Nevada. And appears to be window dressing without any enforcement whatsoever. Headline grabbing versus anything tangible.
"I have a friend , their son visited from NJ to their vacation place in Florida, 55 and over type community..he did not quarantine...like you said, how is that enforced"
"How does the NBA think they will play in Florida, at Disney?https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/24/disney-world…"
"“ How does the NBA think they will play in Florida, at Disney?”I think that falls into the “ seemed like a good idea at the time” category."
Its not likely Nevada would impose a quarantine even if it was needed....
Cuomo says police will be stopping cars with out of state plates in New York. He says violators may face a judicial order and mandatory quarantine along with fines. He also said hotel employees should be questioning guests about their quarantine.Delaware did this a few months ago...prevented me from stocking up at Total Wine...
"Death counts have cratered and that is partially because we are testing more and also the virus already tore through nursing homes and the elderly population. Overall, aprox 42% of all C-19 deaths were in nursing homes. Some states it was as high as 81%. It's hitting the young and healthy mostly now which is fine. If you are 34 or under you have a 0.0005% chance of death from it. Scaring people with the riots is over, and the economy is getting better so the media starts up project fear again. If you look at the provisional death counts from the CDC which the govt. even admits are probably 25% too high, there were 271 deaths involving COVID in the last week. Involving is the key word. Heart attack but had COVID counts. Car accident with COVID in the blood counts. A 90 year old that has been sick for the past year with lung disease and suddenly dies with COVID in their blood and it is COVID that killed them, not having bad lungs or just you know being 90."
"Scaring people with the riots is over"" so who was scaring who and to what end ?"
"""Cases in the U.S. Grow to Their Highest Levels Since April""How does anyone give any credence to the deniers out there? Perhaps they believe, ""It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" Sure it will, any day now."
"The media was. They were hyping up George Floyd's death, the protests, riots. Keep people watching, keep them afraid, hurt the economy and make the orange man look bad. That is, of course, the end goal of every news story."
"Washington Post last nightSeven states are reporting new highs for current coronavirus hospitalizations, according to data tracked by The Washington Post — Arizona, Arkansas, California, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas — as the number of infections continues to climb across the South and West. More than 800 covid-19 deaths were reported in the United States on Tuesday, the first time fatalities have increased since June 7."
"""Scaring people with the riots is over"" so who was scaring who and to what end ?""Crappy political talk from those who don't want the news to show them what's happening and I guess would prefer to see news pieces about cats stuck in a tree. No coincidence that those who talk like that can't accept the truth of this pandemic. These geniuses also don't see that the longer we put off social distancing and refusing to wear a mask only will add to the time this lasts."
"Not sure where PNS got his death rates have cratered or his 271 death count...perhaps I misunderstood his numbersEdited: 1:11 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"weren't all media outlets showing scenes of ""rioting"" ?"
"""...and make the orange man look bad""Like he needs any assistance from anyone else, right?"
"I think the main reason for this is those states of NY, NJ and CT were restricted from visiting Arizona and other states back in March/May when they were at their peak. Seems it's them now turning around doing the same in retaliation and ""returning the favor"". Can't remember what other states had restrictions on NY, NJ and CT, but Arizona was one of them I recall..."
Leaders lead by example....clearly we have no leader...
"Retaliation? That’s some Infowars type conspiracy...simple fact many states that reopened quickly, and did Nt follow mask orders or social distancing are experiencing outbreaks..good decision to prevent or slow visitors from those areas...just as those areas did with NY area visitors...not retaliation"
"Covid ain't a pandemicIt's a scamdemicAs posted above, people who die from other illness but have a trace of covid in them, suddenly the death is recorded as a covid death.People need to start waking up."
Bagman must be on lunch break.He normally is critical of those who post political views.
"“ Like he needs any assistance from anyone else, right?”He must! I have seen his name on this travel forum literally hundreds of times."
"@QThe CDC itself. Death counts for the last week. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/COVID19/Overall death chart ending on June 13 https:/…index.htmAt face value this data is very very promising. That doesn't include taking 25% off the top for deaths where COVID was in the system but did not actually cause death. Increases in infection numbers or even hospitalization numbers aren't a bad thing. I'd say many who are getting tested have an active infection with symptoms. That will skew numbers up. Because C-19 is scary a lot of people will go to the hospital and demand to be admitted. Not everyone with COVID ends up in the ICU, same with people who were in car accidents. Not everyone in the ICU will end up on a ventilator either, which is a good thing because only 10-15% of people on them live."
Glad bagman is here and await his usual outrage.
"Nuzzy, I am still worried about your mental health. I am still hoping you send me a private message so I can help you."
"""Covid ain't a pandemicIt's a scamdemic""It's good to let those hundreds of thousands of people who've died so far know this is just a scam. They'll feel so much better."
My shrink told me yesterday that I'm doing fine as long as I take my psychoactive meds as prescribed.She did say to beware of those who need to wear a bag over his/her head.
Or those who always have a drink in their hands.
"Nuzzy, I got your back buddy. My hope is you come back to normal in November and start actually talking about travel again."
"""How does anyone give any credence to the deniers out there? Perhaps they believe, ""It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" Sure it will, any day now""Wish it away. So espoused Dr. Norman Vincent Peale and his Power of Positive Thinking (who 45 apparently admired greatly). Or...perhaps more like Anthony Fremont and his mysterious, otherworldly cornfield?"
"Pandemic is not over, infection is still rampant, and no amount of happy talk is going to change that.Mask up and social distance, not a hard thing to understand."
"@ PNS,re: ""Scaring people with the riots is over, and the economy is getting better so the media starts up project fear again""The decisions of these states are not made by the media.

"If this C-19 was so virulent I should have had it by now considering I do nothing more than pay attention to who is around me and wash my hands. I don't wear masks, I go out often. Yet, no virus. Even if I did get infected, so what? I'm 36, I have a greater chance of getting shot than I do dying from this thing. I'd quarantine, and when I recover donate plasma for those that need it. No biggie."

"The hoops people jump through to treat 120,000 deaths as no big deal is astounding really. Sociopathic really. But at this point it's a waste of time to argue the numbers because it's better simply to say that re-opening isn't working and the restrictions are slowly returning. Casinos in AZ shutting down, masks becoming mandatory, now we essentially have intrastate travel bans. This is all because the Covid deniers like PnS ""won"" a month ago. Half the country decided to essentially pretend Covid didn't exist. So the shut downs will increase, the travel bans will expand, and the Covid deniers will keep jumping from one lie to the next. And this is the reality we'll live in until we get a vaccine.Several Vegas casinos will shut down before the end of July. Count on it. That's on you PnS and your kind. Congratulations."
"""If this C-19 was so virulent I should have had it...""Wow, is that why you dismiss it so casually? Age is not a guarantee of survival.. you cannot assume anything with this virus."
"As far as I can tell, the only state that has attempted to really enforce, and been able to enforce, a quarantine is Hawaii. I think it's going to be a wee bit more challenging for New York."

"This quarantine will be enforced more at a workplace level and for schools in the fall than on an individual basis. Except for if you turn out to be someone who unfortunately starts a cluster or outbreak. NY does have some contact tracing in place, so expect some fines if you're the one who started it coming in from a hot spot."
"The numbers from your much respected experts at the CDC don't lie. The deaths from COVID-19 have, ever since the lockdowns have been lifted dropped about as steeply as the roller coaster does at NYNY. Just look at them, I posted the links, directly from the CDC's own website. This isn't Breitbart or Fox's sources, but directly from the CDC. The data isn't hard to review. The media and government kept saying ""flatten the curve, flatten the curve"". Well, look that the damn thing. Deaths are basically flat. This is with 3/4ths of all casinos in the country open, with bars and restaurants open for over a month, two in many places. Many places without mask mandates. The only selective manipulation of facts comes from the media. They and the fact that this is an election year are the reasons why we are treating this like the 1918 Spanish Flu and not the 1957 Asian flu. Anyone who was alive back then should remember how it was handled. Country was half the size then in population and the death total was 100,000. The virus was nothing according to the media and the ""experts"". Then once Biden crushed Bernie the narrative became it was the worst thing in the world. In four days Fauci went from take a cruise to national emergency. Just like COVID is all the media cared about until the rioting. Then they could care less if people wore masks, massed in protest or anything else, until that fizzled out again and the virus was all that mattered. What pressure? I don't want anyone to die or suffer but being afraid of something with a death rate for everyone in the 0.02-0.04% range is insane. Changing my life over it is nuts. People act like we are doing a favor to the elderly by forcing them into their homes, destroying their 401k's and other retirement assets, keeping them from enjoy what very well could be the last days or years of their lives. None of us here are children, if we go out we know the risks. If we stay home that is our choice. I'm not responsible for your protection and I certainly don't want anyone else responsible for mine."

An educated citizenry cares about public health and heeds the recommendations of its experts.Our nation's leader and his supplicants make the U.S. look like a failed state.
"No one is being forced outside. I see a lot of people who were forced inside. And that right there is why the ""masks don't protect me, they protect you"" line is so insidious. Either you wear yours to protect everyone else and are a good little person or you don't and are selfish and evil. I know marketing, PR, and bull when I see one. Treating the entire world like a Level 1 Bio Safety Lab is stupid. The constant lies are just disturbing and frankly the sanctimonious platitudes are just tiring. It's like how woke can we go Communist Virus Edition. Being away from all of this for a few days was refreshing. There were times when I forgot the virus existed as I was just having fun. I'd encourage everyone here to do this. It opens the eyes, frees the soul from what has been months of torture."

Just like there is no shame in wanted to enjoy your life on your terms.

I was wrong about Tesla going belly up, though their cars are still terrible. I was wrong about the Cromwell. Thought it would be terrible and ended up loving it. There is literally nothing about this virus and the way it has played out since November that would change my opinion of it at this time. I was low in my guess on deaths from it, and my belief that people wouldn't be willing to upend the world over it. But I'm not a fortune teller nor am I an expert on this subject, just Vegas and a few other things."

But instead Covid deniers are using it to simply say ""the massive rise in cases doesn't matter,"" and that mentality will quickly wipe out whatever success we've had.There are so so many variables involved in why the CFR is what it is. Many we don't even know yet. Looking at the overall number is misleading as the variance from country to country, or state to state is significant. For starters, what were the demographics from those infected a month ago (as they're the ones dying now) versus the current batch of cases (as they'll be the ones dying 3-4 weeks from now) How does re-opening and large public gatherings affect the severity of new cases? Is care improving? Is weather a factor, as in is the average viral load perhaps smaller? We need to learn more. So much more. Instead PnS and his fellow deniers want to say ""all clear.""

"Pns response #40 seems spot on. I hate talking political here,but many things seem so obvious. Nothing has worked to get rid of Trump,and those responsible are looking a bit glum now. Does not surprise me at all that this virus is getting lots of attention again. But,I have,through the years (Im near 70 now),begun to realize that there seems to be absolutely nothing certain political entities wont hesitate to perpetrate on the American people to further their cause. Until this thing either fizzles out or is beaten with a 100% vaccine,it does'nt matter how many times you reopen,the numbers will rise. 100,000 dead in 1969 from the Hong Kong flu and life went on as usual.

The increase in cases came from conservative areas of the state where they think Covid19 only hates liberals."
"@TJP60Trump is merely the personification of a return to freedom. That is why he gets all the hate he does. He refuses to back down to play by the rules. Sounds familiar to how I am basically regarded here vs COVID. Brexit, Brazil, Hong Kong, many other places are electing people that are trying to reverse the illiberal policies put in place, ironically by the liberals or to be more accurate left. I am a liberal, a true classical liberal. What you see on MSNBC and in the Democrat Party isn't. The richest among us who want the destruction of the middle class, liberty aren't going poor. The rest of us are. They can tolerate what is going on now. I said before this happened there would be one more event to try to take out Trump. Never expected it to this this. My mistske."
@HardTenYou can like my trips and completely disagree with my opinions on everything else and think I'm an idiot. Totally fine. As long as people are respectful that is all I ask. Those masks aren't going to make things better. Can't prosecute someone if you can't identify them. Skinny white kid wearing all black with a mask describes like half of Seattle.
"Hominuk response #69. Quit making sense. Unless they miraculously come up with a 100% vaccine,you're quite possibly correct. And it doesn't matter when freedom comes or is extended. I just love these arguments. I just hate the personal attacks. Very childish."

Birdog #77. Excellent post. Already there are mayors and governors condoning this behavior and are real enablers of tyranny. Very scary to see these politicians giving up their cities to this anarchy.
"It's funny that you mention the UK and Brazil as countries whose leaders that you admire considering those are the two countries that are giving us a run for our money in how poorly they are handling the pandemic. Which I'm sure in your fevered enlightened brain is also a conspiracy by the liberals to take down their leaders.I've found that every single person I've ever met who haughtily declares themselves a ""classical liberal"" is simply an empty headed nihilist who took Poli Sci 101 in college. I still stand by that assertion. Feel free to quote Adam Smith all you like though. He sure worked out well for the world."
"Yes PNS,re: post 101, far better to have 120,000+ U.S. deaths, than risk not being able to identify a skinny white kid in a black mask who might apparently commit some kind of petty crime in a casino?...

The 36y/old who is so special, that they have indicated in many previous posts that their chance of death if ever catching Covid-19 is apparently only 0.04% versus the 5.1% rate for the rest of the world's feeble population. Yet a hero, who likes to let us all know that whilst he would normally get the Trojan Suite, or the $5,000 free play, that he'll happily be a man of the people, and pass it up for WhiteCastle.

cushion. yep. death brings out the worse in most of us. 120k and counting. Quite an observation.
One more observation: there's very interesting info re: why people use sarcasm on a regular basis. Almost as interesting as the COVID/mask opinions on this forum!
@GlobalRoamer. 5% death rate. Gtfo with that. What about the millions who’ve had it and never been tested? Might as well make up another number and throw it in there. You’re saying 1/20 people who get Covid die. You really believe that?
Texas keeps setting records for hospitalizations every day.
"5Red What's an acceptable and polite death rate, 4%, 3%? What exactly is the point of your argument?"
"Flipboy, my point is 5% is wrong. And no, 3-4% isn’t acceptable either"
"@5Red, Good point! The news is bad enough and does not require a statistical embellishment."
Good point 5Red. We simply don't know yet what the true death rate is for this virus.
"You know what's fascinating to me? In many cases, the people from the party that claims to care the most about people seem to be the most hateful and ruthless. I have *also* found that many liberals tend to toss their most important principles out the window when it comes to criticizing a conservative.I mean, shaming Hominuk for her top? Well, that's classic slot shaming, isn't it? Unacceptable, right? Oh, but it's okay in this case...or when it's Melania Trump.Comments about singlewide trailers? Poverty shaming? I thought liberals were the ones who had compassion for the poor.It's not just here, of course. Read the comments that black conservatives get, like Candace Owens. Look at the fat-shaming that is regularly targeted at Donald Trump."
"Also, I am horrified by how y'all are treating PnS in this thread. PnS is a great destination expert. He provides detailed trip reports and great information about higher-end suites and other things in Vegas that a lot of regular Vegas travelers don't know much about. He's an asset to the forum, and treating him so coldly because his opinions are different from yours is wrong."

"GlobalRoamer, the true number of infections is likely to be significantly higher than the known positive test numbers, especially as only a very small percentage of people have actually been tested yet. But the reported figure for the number of deaths attributed to the virus is likely to be closer to true, or if anything slightly exaggerated because of deaths where other serious health issues were present but Covid was given as the cause of death. Comparing known positive test numbers with the number of reported Covid deaths won't give an accurate death rate until a much larger proportion of people have been tested.Edited: 6:36 am, June 25, 2020 "
Thank you for reinstating the thread...
"When I see claims of five percent death rate in the same paragraph as I see warnings that you can have it and not even know it, I like to challenge upstate guy step in and explain it all to you. He is smart enough to do it. Will he?"

"@JamRobino,I don't disagree with your point.That's why I said: ""known"" death rate.In fact we may never know the true death rate, but my guess is it's likely to be higher than 1% and lower than 5%.There may also be people dying in developed countries, who remain untested.If the true death rate is eventually known to statistical certainty, and it's lower than the current known death rate of 5%, then that's great news that I'll be very happy about.Edited: 5:23 am, June 26, 2020 "

"GlobalRoamer, yes I certainly agree that the death rate among those who catch the virus is likely to be significantly higher than it is for say the flu, at least until a vaccine is available. And whilst I wouldn't like to put a number on it, it's not the only factor to consider. Those who downplay the seriousness of the virus (not you, I know!) often state that the actual death rate as a percentage of the whole population is low, and/or that it's no worse than flu, therefore the risk is low. But the number who become seriously ill with Covid and need to be hospitalised (not just those that die from it) is much higher than it is for flu. It's that potential to overwhelm hospital and other health care services that can exacerbate the problem and result in even more deaths, not just from Covid but other health conditions. Getting hospital treatment could mean the difference between being seriously ill with Covid but recovering from it, and dying from it. Which is why it's so important everyone gets on board with the simple mitigation measures of social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing.Edited: 6:38 am, June 26, 2020 "
"Testing , testing , testing...the more testing the better..and wear a mask...simple...all the anti maskers are and will continue to make the spread worse..."
"While the fatality rate from the disease is important it only partially tells us how deadly it is. 120,000 out of 2.3 million is about 5%. But if there are 23 million cases as supposed you can say it's .5% right? In some ways that is better, but it also means it is much more contagious than feared and suppressing it will be far more difficult. A disease that has a 10X less fatality rate but is 10X more contagious is just as deadly. We also need to see the demographics of those 20 million unknown infected. If as suspected most of them are under 30 that's small consolation for the older crowd who still might be just a susceptible to complications or death as before. We also need to learn more about viral loads and how they determine if you become symptomatic or asymptomatic. Which means some activities, those indoors in congregated areas in particular cause a higher fatality rate. And of course a jambo stated, availability of medical care plays a huge role in determining the death rate.So many questions still needing answers. Ultimately if 500,000 die it doesn't matter if it's from 7 million or 70 million cases, it's still 500,000 dead and it's too many."

"Tina, a ""deadly"" virus refers to individual risk. How many people actually die from it depends on many other factors. How viral it is being the main one.Ebola is an incredibly deadly disease. Case fatality rates range from 25% to over 50%. Thankfully it's R0 is 2, low enough for containment to work. But not before thousands die from it. We've been successful for the most part keeping it out of the US. Thank god as it is a truly horrifying way to die.

"Its incredibly hard for vegas employees to self quarantine for 2 weeks after every shift of serving self centered, unprotected, couldnt care less about others because it's my vacation crowd that showed up. In the long run, these crowds will be the cause of the next shut down. These employees have to work. If they refused to work, they would have lost their unemployment benifits. Now they are stuck at work wondering if they will bring home the virus to the family, or their kids will come home from daycare with the virus. What about all the grandparents that stepped up to watch kids for essential workers that couldnt self quarantine for the past few months? They stepped up due to daycares closing down. Someday you will see you were part of the problem and not the solution. You wont admit it, but you'll see it. The economy will continue to fail until everyone does their part, or there is a vaccine. Casinos in SW washington and nw oregon are thriving right now. They have required masks and temp checks since day one of reopen. No outbreaks or cases have been traced back to the casinos. No employees have died either."
