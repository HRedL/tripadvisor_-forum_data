"ArchanaG296If there will be no rain in next 3-4 days. Present condition of the valley will get settled by next 10 days or so. In that case, plan for September end can be as it is. Though all the places, specially in Pahalgam and Srinagar will not be as before within this short span of time.Edited: 5 years ago "

"shaziyaa1234Hopefully the flood issue will be settled down in next 10 days or so, if there is no further rain. So, you can stick to your plan for Oct 9th.Edited: 5 years ago "
Asihs da I have planned a trip to kashmir in last week of sept. I have bought flight ticket and package also.Kindly keeping in mind present flood situation let me know should I cancel the trip or go ahead?Pls reply soon
"Dear Roy,My tour planned for the 13th Nov to 16th Nov 2014. I wish till then all things will be settled in the valley to go to the Gulmarg and Sri nagar? Suggest please."
"hi, i have my tickets for srinagar on wednesday 10th september. am going for a trek and have to reach sonmarg on friday evening.1. Should i continue with my flight plan of 10th reaching srinagar ? any hotels around the airport where i can stay ? 2. Have heard that rains have stopped but water logging is still there becayuse of which vehicle movements are restricted... will the water levels recede in a couple of days considering no rain is forecast?3. is it a good idea to move to sonmarg/gumarg directky from the airport ? hows teh vehicle movements there ?"
"The situation is bad, and it is too early to say how things will even out in the near future. The devastation is quite bad, and infrastructure has gone for a toss. I think that people visiting the place before 20th of this month should ideally think about postponing their trip and bookings. Those travelling after still have some time to consider.Basically it is a decision (of going or not) that will have to be taken with limited information. I doubt whether hotel people will be very forthcoming with honest replies. And given the fact that airline cancellation charges are so high, it won't be easy."
most of the hotels are off the grid as phone lines and mobiles are all off. Only the hotels that have offices outside the state are communicating.
just talked to J&K tourism jammu. jammu area can be travelled during this time and from today darshan for mata viashano mandir has opened. Srinagar is worst hit no telephone is working and even after 10 days it will be impossible to restore the roads and it may not be higenic condition in the city. May be goolmarg and pahalgam may be a better place to stay but its difficult to tell now how much the road is damaged. My personal advise is not to visit srinagar in september..may be in october ....
"hi ashish ji,could you please update the present situation if possible we are a group of 15 members all flights and package booked staying in house boats in dal lake from sep 13th 2014 to 17 sep 2014 with day tours planned for gulmarg sonmarg and pahelgam please kindly update is it possible atleast to stay in srinagar it self and come back if we can go to nearby places also regards sidhardh"
"sidhu666Sorry to say, Kashmir will not be ready for tourist by your arrival date (13/9). Srinagar and Pahalgam are worstly affected by the flood.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Hello Ashish, We family of 4 planning to visit on Sep. 25th Srinagar and then Pahalgam and Gulmarg... Do you think the situation would have improved then.. I mean the infrastructure would have improved...Thanks in Advance,Sathiya"
"sats31Things will be settled down by another 2 weeks or so, if there is no further rain. Though, everything will not be as previous state by that time.Edited: 5 years ago "
I am scheduled to travel to Srinagar on 24th Sep and then to Leh via Sonmarg & Kargil the next day by road... Any chances of things improving by then to make it?? All bookings are done so I would be really heart broken if I have to cancel this trip.
"ASHISHDA , i am planning to visit kashmir from 31/10/14 to .07/11/2014. air ticket booked. will it be advisable to travel after the flooods? as reported no. of bridges and roads ARE wiped out., will other parts of kashmir like pahalgam, gulmarg, sonmarg will be reachable. should i cancel the trip n plan to visit some othertime to explore kashmir at its best. kindly advise."
"ShikharshouryaSince you have more than one and half month in hand, hopefully the valley will be back to normal by that time.Edited: 5 years ago "
"sir, our trip to Leh,ladak is sheduled to 15th sept to 18th sept ,kindly advise us whether it would be safe"
"Dear Ashishda,Thanks a lot for the reply n kind advice"
"Dear Aashish,Hi...Can you please throw some light on the current situation.We are planning to visit there from 19th sept to 23rd sept. Should I go ahead with the cancellation or for next 4-5 days??People say Pahalgam and Gulmarg have not been affected too much. Can I change my stay to Pahalgam?? Is the connectivity between Shrinagar and Pahalgam/Gulmarg and Sonmarg an issue??Looking forward for your guidance"
"Hi Garima31As per present condition, it seems the crisis is likely to be over by end of this month. The water may not be there by another week or so, but transport and other travel related infrastructure won't be in a reasonable shape till end of September. Srinagar and Pahalgam are worst affected by the flood. Rather, Gulmarg and Sonmarg are relatively in better condition.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Do not cancel if cancellation charges are being applied. You can wait and try to understand the situation before taking a decision. However, during this month, it will not be an easy task to undertake a tour in a state trying to cope up with the after effects of a devastating flood. And there are serious doubts about infrastructure like roads and power. Even if you reach Srinagar, can you reach Pahalgam? - this is a question that may not have ready answers now, but things will get clearer in the days to come."
U should not cum at all... The condition z worse here... Everythg z drownd in water... Nothg z left... Ppl of kashir r dyin and dey r bein rescued... Its gud fr u guyz not evn think abt cumin dere dis type... It vil take a month or two fr valley to start a normal life...
"I am not a destination expert. But for all those who have queried above abt the Kashmir trip, one friendly suggestion : Though water level would have receded (If no further rains fall) in next ten days it would take a lot of time for the life which is thrown out of gear to return to normalcy at least a month or so. Plus there is fear of epidemics which might spread due to death of large number of cattle / Animals in the area. So best bet would be to postpone your tour at least by a month or change your trip plan to include other places like Shimla / Manali / Dharamsala / Dalhousie etc.. Regards,Rash."
hello sirWe are planning to visit Srinagar and Gulmarg on dated 15th Nov.14 to 19th Nov 14. we have booked air tickets so pl. tell me we should cancel trip or want to see the situation. Pl. tell me about current situation.Pl. tell me.ThanksMAYANK VAISH
"MayankmvGulmarg, Sonmarg and Pahalgam are not much affected by the recent flood. Tourists can visit these places. Hopefully, condition of Srinagar will be much better by the time.Edited: 5 years ago "
HelloI'm visiting during 30th oct to 4th November. .Any chance of epidemic till that time?Gandola ride would be possible?Shikara ride ?Edited: 5 years ago 
"Government of Kashmir has already directed visiting tourists not to reach JnK before 20.9.14. Earlier they had declared the date as 09.9.14. The date will revise again soon. The declaration can be seen at http://www.jktourism.org on the topmost side in scrolling text.Infact, We (6pax) have program for Srinagar, Gulmarg, Sonamarg and Pahalgam from 28th september to 5th october. So, we are eagerly waiting for the good travelling condition which in my opinion is not going to happen this vacation season."
KevalSanghavi Its good time and hope all things ll be positive on that time in october monthThanks
The situation wud be under control by Sept end and Nov so there is no worry do not cancel your bookings keep watching
