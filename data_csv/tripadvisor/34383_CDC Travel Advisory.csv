"It is uncommon for CDC to issue a travel advisory, nut here is their recent release: https:/…travel-in-the-us.htmlTravel safely folk,Hunt"
"Thanks Hunt. We are at a time when we MUST think of others and not just ourselves. Changing travel plans can be an expensive inconvenience, but it certainly beats the alternatives. Despite the CDC guidance and the fact that the virus is spreading faster per capita in Louisiana than anywhere else in the US, our state and local officials are getting a lot of pushback and the restrictions they are imposing here are less than many other locations. This ISN’T a hoax, lives are at stake, and dear travelers, you may not personally be in one of the riskier categories, but someone is and we have to step up to the responsibilities we have to our fellow man.It’s kind of a no brainer....Stay safe and we’ll see you all on Frenchmen as soon as it’s safe.Shameless plug: If you are missing New Orleans tune your devices to WWOZ.org because the music never stops there!"
"Yes, Federal, State, and local officials have some unpleasant, and very difficult choices to make.Our NOLA trip is still a ways out, but given the state of affairs, we inch closer to fully cancelling, every day. Had hoped that things might change for the better, but am not seeing that now. Sad, but not the end of life, and we’ll just plan on getting down, later in the year - hopefully.Best of luck to all,Hunt"
"I think New Orleans is looking forward to seeing the Loup Garou Krewe “getting down”!Edited: 12:06 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"We were scheduled to be there April 6-10, but are in the process of canceling. Pretty much a no brainer at this point. Will reschedule as soon as we can.Regarding WWOZ,that's exactly what I've been doing. Sending a little donation their way as well."
"Thanks for posting Hunt! The French Quarter is emptying out but there are still some stragglers out and about. As for me, I am now grounded until the end of May. After that we’ll see. Everybody stay healthy."
"Thanks for your support Kevin! Hang in Adrienne!WWOZ is probably going to get really stung when they have to refund the Brass Passes they have out. No one even mentioned Brass Passes during last weeks spring pledge drive...We’ll get through this, just make sure we each do everything we can to make sure all our neighbors get through this relatively unscathed."
"Thanks for the WWOZ.org plug ~ although listening to NOLA tunes may land me in a puddle of tears. I am so, so sad to be canceling. :-(~ Colleen"
