"disappointed to read comments on undesireable criminal behaviour in area between irish bar and prom. personal safety is one of this great resorts attractions. are the police being proactive enough or do local hotel groups, bars, shops need to apply pressure. it is in everyones long term interest to protect the package."
What has been happening?
"Re: post 1. Where did you see those comments.?As a family we have been visiting on and off for years and never experienced any such thing.We have always found the town to be safe,our last visit was in July.Is it something very recent?"
"Just had a quick butchers on a couple of Facebook groups, nothing on there?"
CraigYou seem to know something that others do not.It really annoys me when the OP puts a post on TA but when someone asks for clarification. Silence
What criminal activity are we talking about.We have been going to caleta for years and have never noticed anything major.A guy last year i noticed while having a drink sold someone 10 euros worth of weed and there were a few couples having a drink in the same bar as us thought it was hillarious.If its this kind of thing you mean then it happens everywhere and its no big deal.Ive heard of a few people losing valuables by leaving there wallets visable in back pockets etc and while this is horrible you shouldnt take large sums out with you.Caleta is a very safe resort in my opinion and we must be vigalent but not go ott over this.Relax enjoy your your holidays and hire a safe at your accomadation.Leave mobiles tablets wallets passports etc in the safe.Some paople on here say you need to have your pasport on you at all times but i wont ever do that as i think your asking for trouble.Hope no one takes offence.Just my opinion.Peace out brothers
several comments on illegal substances being offered for sale. also people uncomfortable passing through the area near rainbow light post.
"Well, that was a bit of an anti-climax. Not exactly the Bronx, or even Tunbridge Wells."
That particular spot is well known for drug sellers. They hang around on the benches.
"if you do nothing about this problem, it will only get worse."
"I imagine that if I went to Glasgow I'd have no problems getting anything I wanted, same applies to my hometown & to pretty much anywhere in the world, this thread has no point really"
"Phew crisis over. We’re frequent visits to PDLA & have had issues over there on a personal level, there are several posts on that forum regarding problems regarding pickpockets, dealers, ladies of the night etc. This still seems pretty low key in Caleta at the moment & hopefully will remain that way x"
They been there for years. I've lived here for 15 years and my children knew about it years ago. It's probably the next generation of dealers there now.
"Unfortunately drugs are now everywhere, you will even find them in the most affluent resorts.I am visiting a different destination in the Summer,although I will be returning to Caleta in 2020.Just like everything ,be vigilant and enjoy your stay."
"DESTINATION EXPERT. proves my point, do nothing to stop problem it builds, now you seem quite happy to live with next generation. five years ago we had no beggars or rough sleepers, in January we witnessed a threatening dispute between tourist couple and rough sleepers at empty shop units at top of stairs opposite pharmacia /posh jewellers. at 14.00. hrs."
"Drugs and sleeping rough is a world wide problem,it is not easy to eradicate.Most people in their lifetime wil be exposed to this ,regardless of were they live or visit .As for CDF I have never at anytime felt unsafe,hopefully this continue."
"With the current knife crime epidemic in the uk, wouldn’t be too concerned over a couple of pot heads on the beach....."
how many of those involved in current knife problems started off as harmless POTHEADS.
"Far easier to monitor these people when the police know where to look and as mentioned they heve been there for a very long time. Years ago on the island I never saw people eating out of bins, but as resorts grow so do society's problems and these become more visible. IMHO why highlight and draw attention to a minor issue far better to be positive and promote the good things that Fuerteventura has to offer."
"Scotland has just been deemed as having the biggest drug problem in Europe.What can we do to solve it? I live there but I do not feel threatened,likewise as when I visitCDF in.Fuerteveventura which is relatively mild in comparison.The majority of users are victims of themselves.Dealers target known users.It is such a shame that the worry has ruined your visit."
"Just been reading about the undesirables in CDF, yes they are about and not causing any trouble or so i thought. I have been visiting CDF over the past 12 years and last year bought my own place there. OMG wish I would have known about SQUATTERS ( scumbags) rights before I had. They are constantly breaking into the property next door but 1 to me ( owned by bank) and police won't do anything about them, as they don't want them on the streets for the tourists to see. They have linked in to my electric, so they were sat happily watching TV whilst i had no electric and was paying for it which is a criminal act to tamper with the electric metre but police walked away. Yesterday morning woke to find all my beautiful pots of flowers had been stolen from my garden, along with next door neighbours. Police came to say that the squatters had reported us for "" infringing their rights"" as walking past "" their"" ( banks ) property, but we are walking on public path. OMG police really need to get a grip in this resort or it will be like all the others. Seriously thinking of selling up . If any police in CDF reading this i would like your comments."
OP if you do not think you will like the area you refer to go to another part of the island or another destination.
"GabbyLeads,Thats not a nice position to be in. But its not the polices fast its the law thats at falt. Ive had similar situations with my place over the years. If you are not living or using your place I suggest you turn off all your utilities. I would also report the theft the of electric to Endesa (or whoever your supplier is). They will have more influence than you in getting the police to act. I would also make a complaint to the bank for not dealing with the problem. If you are not living there or using the place I would get some heavy duty locks. Good luck I hope it works out for you."
