"My daughter has just graduated from college and accepted a job in Cincinnati. We are going later this week to look for an apt. Her priorities are hip, cool, affordable. My priorities for her are SAFE and affordable. She is looking at Mt. Adams, Eden Park, Hyde Park and Clifton. We will be coming via I-71. Can someone suggest a decent hotel for a couple nights that is convenient to these areas. We don't mind staying a little bit suburban an driving in. Thanks!"
"Blue Ash is a good area for suburban hotels.. but if she is look at Mt Adams, Eden Park and Clifton, I would almost suggest staying in downtown cincinnati or across the river at the comfort Suites in Newport"
"She should check out Oakley as well. It's the neighborhood in which I grew up, and has become pretty hip in the past decade. Although I think it's becoming more expensive, apartments will probably still be cheaper than Hyde Park (which is next door) or Mt. Adams. And it's a pretty safe neighborhood. "
Thanks so much!
"Yeah, the line between Hyde Park and Oakley is pretty blurred by this point. Oakley has come a long way and is the ""new Hyde Park."" Prices have gone up drastically and it is a very safe neighborhood. May even want to look into some parts of Norwood as it may be a better deal - stay on the east side of Montgomery though. Clifton has nice parts but also can be dangerous as the crime is there along with the students.G"
"Ditto Gman, he is completly right. Also consider apartments in Northern KY. Parts of Norwood are adjacent to the Rookwood area of Hyde Park and very c lose to Hyde Park square."
Not sure about northern Kentucky... We were in Covington/Newport a few weeks ago and there seems to be a hooker epidemic around that area. It was very obvious and EVRYWHERE!
"Shoup-a-loop--There are a ton of places in NKY that aren't ""bad areas"". Fort Thomas is Mayberry all over again with a view of the river and city skyline in many places, and easy interstate access. Bellevue is right on the river and is becoming hipper by the minute with lots of new high-end condos being built. To get a great view of the skyline you need to be in Kentucky or Mt. Adams, but Mt. Adams is pricey.Florence has great access to the airport and is very family friendly. It is just killing me to say all that nice stuff about the other side of the river, but it's true."
