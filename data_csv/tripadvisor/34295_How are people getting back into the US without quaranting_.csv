I am sorry if this is somewhere on the boards but I have been searching and searching trying to figure out how all these people are going to Cabo from the US and get back without having to quarentine? Is it not a problem coming back? I would love to head over but did not think it was open as of yet.
Here is what you are supposed to do when returning from International Travel.  https:/…after-travel-precautions.html
"I think it might vary by state but I believe California doesn’t require quarantine after traveling to Mexico perhaps Washington state is different? You might want to refer to your states government website for more information. However, we have been freely traveling in and out of Mexico since C19 began and have had no issues returning by vehicle. As an American citizen you can’t be denied entry but for quarantine just refer to your state govt.Edited: 2:43 pm, July 04, 2020 "
Landed in Los Angeles yesterday after a week in Cabo. All I was told was welcome back.
"Linda L - good to bring it up, don’t think it’s been addressed here. I can only relate to my circumstance. My wife went to Steamboat same day as my trip here. She’s home now, tested, results due early next week. She’ll no doubt test negative. I leave Thursday, return Friday morning (such is travel here to Maine), testing that afternoon. No doubt negative. So we reunite, plus fam, early the following week. My wife and I have opted to go that route. Not worth the chance of exposure otherwise. I’m betting we’re in the minority and no judgement to those going otherwise. Nobody is gonna follow you at the returning airport in all likelihood."

Linda L - Don't give Jay Inslee any ideas............
"Go Joey! No doubt tied on purpose, looking for the drama! Sometimes hard to say God Bless America but I just did. No idea on the Bulldog challenge but I won a poolside chugging contest at Palmar way back in the day on my son’s HS graduation trip, a proud parenting moment."
Thanks all! #6 no kidding we are already in such a mess!!
How was everything? Is it worth going?
"Sylvia C - definitely worth going for me. I love the sun and beach and the Mexican vibe. Enough open to choose from for dining. If looking for water sports and the oftentimes frenetic energy of pre-COVID Cabo, stay home. That’ll likely take a while to return. I can sorta feel it simmering but..."
No quarantine requirements for returning to WA state.
Where did you stay? Any restaurants you recommend. How was the beach? Thank you for taking time to respond.
"Last day here for me, stayed at Villa del Arco. I did a mix of all inclusive and town. AI was somewhat limited because Villa del Palmar is closed but okay for me. I ate at Gardenias, Campestre, Baja Brewing, La Pintada, Tabasco’s. Gotta pick a spot for tonite. I oughta branch out more. The beach was great as always. Some days calm, some not so much. Some days really hot. I walked (trudged) it every other day or so. Vendors were maybe a little more aggressive than usual but why wouldn’t they be. All in all a relaxing couple of weeks solo. Looking forward to getting together with my wife after my test results come back negative as hers did after her Steamboat trip!"
"My wife’s boss wanted her tested after she found out we traveled to Cabo, my wife is a dental hygienist. This was decided while the boss was at a graduation party. 4 1/2 hours in the ER and 8 hours later she was negative and back to work. The next day her boss came out with a travel policy about having to test after international travel but we can go to Vegas and no test required. Of course you can come back that day, get tested and go to work the next. I work for a hospital and they required nothing. You can’t make this stuff up."
The logic of this is insane isn't it?!!
"Insane logic, smrbrz? That’s a good one!"
"Sylvia - we just got back to DFW last night. We stayed at Dreams and did not venture out this trip. We had a great week of fun in the sun...made several new friends and enjoyed plentiful food and drinks! Some of our new friends ventured out, but said the marina is still pretty quiet. Texas does not require a quarantine and customs was a breeze coming home."
"Texas may not require a quarantine, but the CDC says that anyone travelling internationally must stay home and quarantine for 14 days after arrival home? We are scheduled to go at the end of July, but unless we ignore the CDC recommendations, doesn't seem like my 5 day quick trip to Cabo may be worth it?"
"Why the heck would anyone follow the CDC “guidelines” at this point?Do you wear a mask into a restaurant only to immediately take it off upon eating? Do you wear the same mask day in and day out that continues to carry your germs on it?It’s an absolute joke. No one will tell me what I can and cannot do. It is the definition of unconstitutional which it seems a few people on here have no issue with.Mexico isn’t the issue, the US and this BS mainstream media we have IS."
