"The Animal Control Department has issued a rabies warning. A rabid cat has been confirmed from a temple on the Thornburi side of the Memorial Bridge. They are watching and area which includes Thornburi, Chinatown and down to Bangrak.Although it is good practice anytime, now is a good time to consciously avoid those cute kittens and puppies"
Good advice!
"Yes.........Khlong San district is on the Thonburi side of river, and below is news blip, and below that is a map.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1111968/khlong-â€¦s18.postimg.org/xqd1m2cix/Khlong_San.jpgEdited: 3 years ago "
anti-rabies and tetanus shots are always useful to have before travelling.
I understand that pre exposure immunisation for rabies is not widely available unless you are seriously at risk of infection.
"It is always a good idea in any country to give strays a wide birth as often they are unpredictable and may bite or attack without provocation, even those that are not rabid pose a serious threat of infection and disease."
Well I am glad I got my rabies shots now...hate getting shots but the lady at the travel clinic was insistent.
Am I mistaken or is The Peninsula smack bang in the middle of the outlined rabies zone?
Yup; it's in the neighborhood. The Hilton is even closer.Edited: 3 years ago
