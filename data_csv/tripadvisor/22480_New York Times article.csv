"There is an eye opening New York Times article out that describes some of the fear Mexicans have of hospitals, especially now. Really something to think about."

I’m talking about a different article though. Sorry I am inept at linking. :)
Looks good on them for the poor job the US is doing at home on the virus the people dont even follow there own health experts advice they dont care very poor leadership on there part in the USA.

"This is an incredibly sad article , but I know it is true.. and there are many more cases on the Island than being reported. Thanks for sharing."
I would be afraid of an IMSS hospital under normal circumstances.
"Eric, Me too!"
IMSS? Me three!
"A vicious Catch-22: because people fear going to hospitals, they don't go until it's too late, and that additional death fuels the fear of hospitals and only makes it worse."
Between the Mexican people being scared of hospitals and the medical bills it is no wonder they stay home so long. Very sad situation.

Thanks for the link milee.
I would not believe ANYTHING the New York Times reports....
Ditto on that!
gobetrecker -- why not?
"Living here I can tell you the fear the article speaks of is real. People here are afraid to go to the hospital. It's a huge issue and as Mark pointed out in an earlier post, a vicious cycle. People wait to long to go then it's too late. They die and people become even more afraid because they say he was doing okay at home but then died when he went to the hospital. It's a never ending cycle. Personally, I'd do just about anything to avoid going to an IMSS hospital but luckily I have other options. Many people do not and end up playing Russian roulette with their health."
"Posts 14 and 15 are part of the reason this virus has spread so badly. I would bet those posters won't wear masks, either."
No masks but they might believe in a hydroxychloroquine cocktail with a bleach chaser .
Why not? because fear controls people! as long as the fear keeps getting pumped into peoples minds the ones promoting the fear can control the people. i have to wear a mask at work all day every day. never stopped working since this thing broke out. life went on for me and never stopped. was not one of the people hiding in my house afraid top go out. Not afraid to go to the doctor or hospital. Yet people have no problem going to Walmart! LOL! Go figure!

"I confirm:""Living here I can tell you the fear the article speaks of is real."" Martinez (who died recently of covid in hospital) his last whatsapp message was that he will never go to hospital, as very few get out from there alive. Sadly he got no choice and went ... to hospital ... there is no enough medications, doctors ask relatives to buy them and bring so they could treat"
"It’s all political now and this forum isn’t the place to discuss it. Yes, I wear a mask when in public. I will wear one whenever possible on Isla. I’m also very aware of politics and the games that are played. It’s just so difficult to find a RELIABLE news source these days. I have my issues that I have bias, sure but I don’t lean to the left OR right but the media certainly does...."

What does Fox news have to do with a NYT article? LOL! The facts are this whole virus thing has turned political. You can believe what you want and others can also have a opinion about it. The truth is once they start taking your rights away they tend to keep it permanent. They said MILLIONS would be dead in the U.S right now because of the virus. Don't wear a mask then you must wear a mask? Millinois dead in the U.S? Where?

"Why not just exagerate more and say you heard billions were going to die, its just as ridiculous as your statement because it never happened.The highest estimate I saw early on from the US government was 750,000-1,000,000 dead. That was IF no preventative measures were taken.So here we are near 200,000 with months if not years to go.I think the one million mark will prove a conservative estimate.Edited: 12:14 pm, August 30, 2020 "
