Rules are being enforced as the Virus is still persisting in Turkey.Link is here.https:/…news
But you are safer in Turkey than in the UK and face masks don’t work.Or so I keep reading!!
FJ thanks for the news. The picture is taken in Gaziantep! My current city of residence rank the 3rd in term of coronavirus cases in Turkey. I agree on the step taken by the authority as it was worse to find myself the only one person who wore mask in a park.
"Iain-M. Why are you safer in Turkey than the U.K.?? Face mask protect others from germs when someone coughs or sneezes. The virus can take 2 -14 days to develop, so wearing a face mask means protection for others, from someone who has contracted the virus and is not aware of this fact. It goes some way to stop them from spreading it."
"Hi Folks,Here is a link for you to see how Turkey (average) fares against UK (poor), and US (very poor). and other countries. ""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/…"".enigma..."
"Interesting data, so UK has 10x death rate per milion population and almost twice the infection rate compared to Turkey."
FJ?I think my sarcasm may have been lost.
"Turkey only gives Official Government Figures and 400 people have been detained for giving other figures in Turkey which they think are correct.I really do not think we can compare both countries fairly. Also, remember the U.K. is divided into 4 countries. Northern Ireland (no new cases and doing well) Wales, Scotland (also doing well and virus figures dropping, unlike Turkey where are rising again) and England. I live in Scotland we have great figure here decreasing every day. We only have 5.5 million population, lets remember London alone has nearly 9 million people. England has the most figures of the four countries in the U.K. They have a much bigger population.Edited: 6:43 am, July 09, 2020 "

"Frances-Jane: Every country only gives official figures. A link to the 400 detentions for giving other data perhaps? I assume those were all people working in the Ministry or Health or some hospital or something?While I am sure Scotland's and England's data is pure as driven snow - the UK government is lauded intenationally for the excellence of its covid statistics - and us poor Turks, we poor things, can't get anywhere near that level - the fact remains that we have done serological surveys which more or less confirm what was expected from the swabs. The UK hasn't even managed to get testing right:"" The prime minister’s spokesman said that the government has now abandoned attempts to provide a daily figure for the number of individuals being tested for coronavirus. Early in the crisis the government did publish daily figures for the number of individuals tested, alongside figures for the number of tests carried out. But the figure for the number of individual figures became increasingly embarrassing because, as the government intensified testing to meet its target of 100,000 tests a day by 1 May, the gap between the number of individuals being tested and the number of tests being carried out became ever larger. (On 30 April, when the government hit its target, 122,347 tests were carried out, but only 73,191 individuals were tested.) In May the government stopped publishing daily figures for the number of individuals being tested. Officials said that the government would resume publishing this figure once it had found a way of ensuring that the statistics were robust, and that people were not being counted twice. But today the spokesman said that that goal has now been dropped. He explained: DHSC [the Department for Health and Social Care] will no longer publish the number of people tested daily any more, and will instead publish the number of daily tests processed. This is because the daily people tested statistic only counts new people being tested. For example, someone who was tested in February, and then tested again this month, would be counted once. Considering hospital and care home staff will now be tested on a regular basis, we don’t think this statistic would be an accurate reflection of the amount of daily testing that is taking place. Test and trace statistics published weekly will include the number of people who have been tested.But when the spokesman asked why it was not possible to change the system so that it could count a person being tested on a given day, even if they had been tested before, the spokesman was unable to give an explanation. He was also unable to explain why the government has continually given a figure for the number of testing kits sent out, but no figure for the number of testing kits sent out that do not get returned."""
"Don't get me wrong. I appreciate your caution - goodness knows, anyone should be able to figure that out from my posts - but this notion of evaluating numbers based on gut feeling irks me."
"Frances-Jane, Are the following the main reasons why you find UK figures so reliable: ""https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/britain-corona…"", and ""https://www.actuaries.org.uk/news-and-insigh…"". and ""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…"".enigma..."
