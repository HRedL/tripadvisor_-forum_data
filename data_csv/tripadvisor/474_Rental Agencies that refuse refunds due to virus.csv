"fabioMn, another way to ask is what rental companies/hotels DO give refunds due to someone's inability to travel due to no fault of their own!Edited: 8:56 pm, March 18, 2020 "
This is clearly an exceptional situation and I have sympathy for both parties - clearly there are visitors who don’t want to travel or can’t travel or have been advised not to do so and obviously don’t want to lose money.However property owners have overheads and may rely on rental income as their primary source of income and could be severely affected by the virus downturn.I don’t know if there is a solution that keeps everybody happy but remember there is always another side to the story and I’m not a property owner so have no vested interest.In my case my property owner was willing to let me move my payments to alternative dates but I am able to get a full refund from my travel insurance so only the big insurance company loses out.
not giving a full refund under the circumstances or at minimum allowing people to rebook next year etc. is simply unconscionable and i agree that agencies should be named so others can avoid in the future.
not giving a full refund under the circumstances or at minimum allowing people to rebook next year etc. is simply unconscionable - Playing devil's advocate the virus whilst not the fault of the renter is equally not the fault of the agency.Why should the agency be the one to lose out financially when they are just following the terms of the contract agreed - every rental I've ever entered into has had the opportunity to buy trip insurance which could have provided cover for this event.
Why should the agency be the one to lose out financially? Because under the extraordinary circumstances it is the RIGHT thing to do....it is also an investment in the future. People will return and they will probably only book with that agency ...word of mouth it another benefit for owner/agency. Many of these people are year after year regulars ....return business is everything. Just a few of the reasons. Know quite a few owners down there and they all are working with guests either to reschedule or refund....this is a bad situation for all involved but right now top priority is staying home and healthy.
"Exactly gene. Property owners are able to carry insurance too, if they choose to."
Anna Maria Vacations......
Use social media to let Anna Maria Vacations (and others) know how you feel about their policy. I just did on Twitter (@AMIvacations).
"It was mentioned that travel insurance would refund the money. That’s often not the case. Many policies exclude epidemics. My own travel insurance would only have paid out if I or a family member was ill, not if we were simply keeping ourselves and others safe by not traveling. And an exclusion for epidemics. Fortunately I got most of my money back from the resorts and Amtrak."
"Possibly if they gave everyone a refund they would not care if they are shamed online, they may not be in business next year.Contracts are two way documents, you abide by your end they abide by theirs. If there is a penalty for cancellation, you agreed to it upfront.How would you feel if they called you a week before arrival (pre pandemic) and said sorry, decided not to rent to you after all and refunded your money."
"To add to post 10 - they called a week before and said somebody else was prepared to pay an extra $1,000 for your rental.I just don’t think it’s right to condemn all the rental agencies as the bad guys in this situation - there are always 2 sides to every storyProbably not a popular view on this forum"
"I would go back and read the contract carefully. Most places on the coast will have provisions about a hurricane. This situation comes close without the mandatory evacuation. If there is some sort of language that comes close, you might try a credit card dispute.This is actually one of the few intelligent questions/remarks I have seen in the last few days."
"Here’s the thing that all these rental companies need to consider - if your renters are dead next year or our economy and healthcare system is totally collapsed due to the widespread illness, you won’t be in business either. I would contact state officials and encourage them to crack on hotels/vrbo still soliciting visitors or refusing to refund. They are jeopardizing all of us and the message from government and scientists has been very clear. They are even talking about 18 months of suppression or until the vaccine is proven successful."
We have a condo booked through Florida rental by owners. The balance is due in May for a vacation June 7th. However at the moment there are no flights from UK to USA. We are hoping that this will change before our balance is due otherwise we will have to cancel as we won't know about our flight till nearer the date. I feel so awful as I know the bigger picture is about people losing their lives but I feel it for the people who could also lose their livelihoods. Such a sad situation.
Surely if governments are advising against all travel and airlines stop flying some kind of agreement can be reached between the parties concerned?
Ask Forida Attorney Generalmyfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/E3EB45228E…
"Our family along with two others booked a home on March 12th for the week of March 21. Following a few days later the government came out with its no discretionary travel recommendation. I called the next day to cancel and got the same, “our Cancellation Policy is still in affect.” Since rebooking later in 2020 wouldn’t work for the schedules of our three families, we had no choice but to cancel. In addition, I never even executed the contract. I even offered to let them keep some of the money to reach an amicable resolution, but instead they re-listed our rental for the same price, minus what I offered them. I have since told them that we do not intend to subsidize their poor business decisions. @AMIvacations"
"The Governor has declared a state of emergency. Bring this to the attention of the rental agency, and explain you could pursue this in small claims court. Or ask the credit card company if you used this to reimburse you for not being able to fulfill the contract under a state of emergency."
"Anna Maria Vacations is refusing to offer any refund due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the State of Emergency. We booked the same large 10+ person home as years past for our upcoming Spring Break trip for March 21-28, 2020. We have been carefully watching the news regarding shut-down of the island due to the novel COVID-19 Outbreak. The US State Department has issued a world wide level 4 - Do not travel advisory- due to the outbreak. The White House has issued guidelines from March 16-31, 2020 to avoid gatherings more than 10 people in public or at homes and to avoid discretionary travel of any kind. The State of Florida, the city of Anna Maria, and the county of Manatee is under a State of Emergency. Restaurants and beaches are closed and the grocery stores have limited supplies.Our towns have issued a city wide lock down where we can not leave our homes except to get food or medicine. We physically can not use the home due to a situation out of our and their control.Many other rental companies on the island have made public announcements they will issue full refunds for anyone traveling. Anna Maria Vacations is NOT willing to offer any refund for our reservation of over $7000. We asked to move our funds to another date in 2021 or for a full or partial refund. They will not accommodate or talk through any option.Please DO NOT rent from this company. They are NOT socially responsible nor do they care about the safety of others. They have been incredibly rude, unaccommodating and unwilling to do the right thing for their customers during this historic State of Emergency in our country."
Anna Maria Vacations will NOT issue a refund of any kind due to the COVID-19 State of Emergency
Our vacation has been planned since July last year. No one could ever imagine that our country/world would be in this predicament however Anna Maria Vacations rental company has not been so accommodating. They have no cancellation policy therefore they will not issue a refund. Our option was to reschedule another date this year. Trying to coordinate 3 families with another date is almost impossible. We also don’t know what the next few months will look like as far as this pandemic goes. They should be ashamed because other companies are doing the right thing. Our only option was to cancel as our governor issued a “shelter in place.” The government has said no 10 or more people gathering. The Florida governor has said stay home. We are doing our part & they are not.
"We rented a house through Anna Maria Vacations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is my family’s best interest not to travel. Despite our repeated attempts to find a mutually agreed upon resolution, Anna Maria Vacations has maintained an attitude that lacks any compassion or reason. At this point, if we cannot reschedule in 2020, we are out thousands of dollars. Given the current global crisis we are extremely unsure of when travel bans will be lifted and things will get back to normal. Additionally, since the house that we rented sleeps 10, we are adhering to the guidelines put forth by the CDC, The White House and the state of Florida to not gather in groups of 10 or more. However, Anna Maria Vacations is essentially saying “come on down and bring your germs from Illinois with you”. We take the health of our family, the residents of Anna Maria Island, and our global community very serious during this crisis and we feel that this company is lacking in their social responsibility. We were repeat customers with this company. We will be back to Anna Maria Island, but we will never use them again."
"Hey Anna María Vacations, do the last minute deals on your web site come with a ventilator? Quit burying your head is the sand, step out of your AMI bubble, and make things right for your customers! If AMV thinks this crisis is a strain on its business now, wait until the backlash from how irresponsible AMV and its' Property Owners are being. It's obvious you do not care about the health and well-being of your customers, but what about that of the residents of AMI – the most vulnerable during this crisis. Wake up!"
Good to know!
""" I would contact state officials and encourage them to crack on hotels/vrbo still soliciting visitors or refusing to refund. ""For the record. VBRO is refunding their fees for renters, the rest is up to the individual owners as to whether they will do the right thing and refund. Our Rental owners were very gracious and are giving us a full refund. Also, most travel insurance won't cover pandemics unless you purchase a ""cancel for any reason"" policy. Who would have thought a pandemic would be a serious thing to consider when purchasing a travel policy."
same experience for our group with Anna Maria Vacations. Big black eye on AMI.
"Let Anna Maria Vacations (and others) know what you think of their no-refund policy.On Twitter: @AMIvacations or https://twitter.com/AMIvacationsDo it like this.1. Sign up for a Twitter account.2.

Anna Maria vacation rentals is not honoring cancellations. Only re-bookings with restrictions and loss of some value of original payments.
"Sue them. Every contract contemplates a covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Arguably, they have violated that covenant, under the circumstances. They operate in interstate commerce through the internet, which means that they are doing business in your state. So, sue them in small claims court and make them travel to your state to defend themselves...or, alternatively, propose that they offer you a reasonable resolution to the situation."

Anna Maria Vacations has been awful.
So true. Everyone loses in this
Any normal human being and legit business would offer a refund. Their overhead is irrelevant in this situation and they will also reep the benefits of some type of govt. bailout. I always recommend travel insurance (cheap and helps).
Has anyone that has been impacted by not getting a refund filed a complaint with the Florida Attorney General?
I just wanted to post with an update:Camellia Properties (La Costa and Gulf View condos) is issuing full refunds.Best Beach Getaways (Marbella condos) is now issuing full refunds for certain dates (if the renter is unable to reschedule).
"Yes, we filed a complaint against Anna Maria Vacations with the FL Attorney General. Please do the same as they will be happy to talk with you."
"We don’t have anything booked on Anna Maria for this year. I just wanted to throw that out there as a suggestion in case someone hasn’t thought about doing that. They closed our Outer Banks here in NC and the rental agencies and homeowners are required to provide for refunds to anyone that had a booking. If anyone has a problem getting a refund, our attorney general will fix it very, very fast!"
"Vrbo/Homeaway. I had a week planned on Anna Marie Is. this week and Vrbo refuses to consider a full or even a partial refund. They take your money but do not take any responsibility. Airbnb, on the other hand, is doing the moral thing and making total refunds, no questions asked. Guess who I will making reservations with on my next vacation."
"Any updates about Anna Maria vacations? We were booked to come down May 30. I have been too busy at work to even call (nurse practitioner). We have rented from them several times, but I will certainly not ever again if they don't make this right."
The travel insurance offered by some of these rental companies does not cover Covid-19 cancellations. The renters are not being protected in any way.
Gov. Desantis suspended all AMI beach rentals today for two weeks.
Refund Pending for usWe have had to cancel our holiday to AMI for 18th April. Now that the airlines are not flying from the UK we had no way to get there. We were due to stay at Bradenton Beach and contacted our rental agency RVA who have agreed to cancel our reservation and refund our payment minus a 5% processing fee. They have been quick to respond to our contacts and advise that the refund has been processed so hopefully in our CC account in the next few days. As a result of their pro-active assistance we would definitely use them again when booking for our 13th visit. (provided of course that the money gets deposited).With regards to the airlines Virgin Atlantic have agreed to provide a full refund for our flights. This will take up to 3 months to reach our account but happy with their interaction and response too.Car hire which we always book from www.uscarhire.com have already refunded our full payment within a few days. For travellers from the UK I would recommend this company as we have always had great service from them.Holiday Inn Express have also agreed to refund the 'non refundable' payment for our airport hotel rooms for the evening before our flights.For us it was horrible having to cancel our vacation. My sister and brother in law were coming with us for the first time and couldn't wait. I'm not sure how long it will be until we can re-book that vacation but hopefully our trip in December won't be affected. The main thing really is that everyone stays as safe as possible and doesn't spread this virus. This forum will help people to make choices on who they book with in future based on the service and assistance they received at this time. We were also affected by the ash cloud years ago when our travel plans had to be delayed and we were well treated by the vendors that we dealt with then. We stayed loyal to those vendors and rental owners as a result and made recommendations on the basis of how we were treated. We will do so again based on this experience.
"msbasil, your source please...""Gov. Desantis suspended all AMI beach rentals today for two weeks.""Thanks."

"AMI Beach Club also refusing refunds. We booked through HomeAway who have a Covid19 policy in place and are urging owners to offer full or partial refunds and even rewarding owners who do. Despite numerous pleas AMI beach club flat out refused to offer a refund and are happily keeping our money knowing that there is no way we can travel. HomeAway were shocked by their response and confirmed 99% of owners are offering refunds given the circumstances. We are not in a position to reschedule our trip at the moment, however if we visit Anna Maria in the future we will avoid AMI Beach Club."
"I don't know if they're owned by the same company, but in the beginning Anna Maria Vacations was taking reservations for them."
You are spamming forums summerloge
Interesting and sounds likely as they are taking a similar unreasonable approach. Good luck to them getting bookings when this is all over!
"Anna Maria Vacations is refusing to refund one cent of our April 2020 trip that is being cancelled due to COVID-19. So unfortunate. We even offered to split the cost because we know homeowners are losing out, too, but this was declined."
Update ~ I just filed a complaint with the Florida Attorney General's office even though Anna Maria Vacations told me on the phone today that the AG is supporting their decision to not issue refunds for travel affected by COVID-19. I do not trust what Anna Maria Vacations is saying and want to hear this from the AG myself.
"Hi, Just to give a shout out to Coastal cottages as they have just refunded my trip I booked for April . Therefore I will definitely use them in the future ."
"It’s the same old worn out story with a good majority of these rental agencies whether now, red tide etc..,,At first they say you have a contract, next they say the owners will not refund (it’s doubtful if they even talked to the owner)..Then they get a little social pressure and then say you can rebook for a later date ...Then the social pressure ramps up to such a degree that they now acuatally ask the owners if they would refund the guests.Greed in these situation is not very becoming for an individual or business.I monitor the vacancy rate on the Island and notice that most all of the rental agencies seem to fill about 37 Weeks for individual rental units per year.Leaving 10 weeks of rental money on the table to an owner, this is very significant money, 10k to as much as 20k.Instead the rental companies alienate the present guests with greed.There are over 1500 rentals listed on VRBOWhere did the come from, they came from the rental companies on the Island, it seems they have alianeted quite a few owners also.That is quite a bit of market share loss you would think they would have learned by now. So instead of showing greed, they should work harder to fill an addition 10 weeks of rentals for the owners, making the agency commission more than whole, for the lost 2 or 4 weeks"
"“Update ~ I just filed a complaint with the Florida Attorney General's office even though Anna Maria Vacations told me on the phone today that the AG is supporting their decision to not issue refunds for travel affected by COVID-19. I do not trust what Anna Maria Vacations is saying and want to hear this from the AG myself.”I had a very hard time believing the AG would support this. According to the executive order, they’re not even allowed to check in new guests for the next month. “Vacation rentals are prohibited from making new reservations or bookings and shall not accept new guests for check- in for the duration of this order.”"
"How about also starting a write in campaign to the Sun and Islander suggesting the topic of how different rental agencies on the island are handling refunds and communicating with clients. I plan to, especially after the Sun published an article on March 15 saying how the virus could be a boost to island tourism.We have been in stay at home since March 16...so I do get testy.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g63597…"
Has anyone read the Executive Order from Florida’s governor banning new short-term vacation rental check-ins during the course of the order? It states “shall not accept new guests for check in during the duration of this order.” Doesn’t that mean Anna Maria Vacations cannot by law check us in on April 12 which is what our contract states?
""" Doesn’t that mean Anna Maria Vacations cannot by law check us in on April 12 which is what our contract states?""Yes, that is exactly what it means."
That's how I read it yes. They are obviously trying to stop people travelling by putting a halt on short term lets and introducing a 30 day minimum rental period. It gave me some comfort knowing the owner who refused to give us a refund for our upcoming April trip now won't be able to rent the place out again and effectively make a double profit on this bad situation!
"But if they can’t legally rent to you in April per your rental agreement with them, wouldn’t they have to refund your money because they can’t uphold their end of the agreement? Obviously none of us has ever been faced with anything like this before so it’s hard to know how to proceed. And obviously everyone’s first choice would be for this nasty thing to go away so we could all take our Anna Maria vacation as planned. But it seems to me that if they can’t provide the rental per the agreement dates then the rental contract is voided by them, therefore you should get a refund of your money."
Worth approaching them saying exactly that. We've just recently cancelled our reservation (as we were getting nowhere with the owner and cancelling was the only way to start the process of trying to claim via our travel insurance) so technically I think they would say we've broken the contract so this new rule doesn't therefore apply to us. If you haven't cancelled yet I think it's worth a try. Good luck!
Wasn't the executive order announced on March 27th? If it took effect before Monday March 29th and lasts two weeks a rental starting Sunday April 12th would be allowed.
Needs to suspend for longer. Why are people vacationing during a pandemic? No renting should be permitted af this time.
"I feel all of your pain, I will never understand how anyone can be so selfish along with being greedy. You took people's money and provided absolutely nothing for them.Put all their names on BBB, Better Business Bureau. Their ratings will be seen here."
"Booked a holiday in Naples. Flights refunded but then villa owner is being very inactive in refunding us anything, such as the cleaning fee, and wanted to charge us for rescheduling. Booked through Homeaway and disappointed with their lack of action."
"Hi Pete. Fellow Wisconsin’ite here. Had a 6 bedroom house booked for a week in early April, not cheap. No refund I was told after many emails and frustrating phone calls. I saw your post, I took your advice, used some of your wording in an email. Received a phone call from management in about 1 hour after sending email. They asked for 24 hours to review, received a phone call the next day offering a 95% refund. Thank you for chiming in. All the best."

Pete's post is #29 in this thread.
"Have friends who booked The Best Little Beach House on Anna Maria Island for 4/25 and they are being refused a refund as well. Booked through VRBO who has been facilitating emails with the owner but they are refusing anything, not even rebooking for a future date. I would think that rental owners would be worried about bad press but from the looks of these posts seems like no one is worried. Shame..."
DeSantis extended the short term rental ban until April 30. It is illegal to rent for less than 30 days.Look up the latest edition of the Islander newspaper. It has an article about compliance. There are local phone numbers to contact and State departments to lodge complaints.I would think it would be illegal to charge for something they legally can not rent.
These bad rental owners must think no one will remember. How foolish.
I have noticed that many of these posts have been removed by the owner. My guess is that these were about Anna Maria Vacations and they asked people to remove their post once they finally made things right. On the BBB website there are a ton of complaints as well. Good news is that it looks like Anna Maria Vacations has finally decided to do the right thing and offer refunds/rescheduling even if in 2021. Too bad it took all the bad press for them to do the right thing. People will still remember.
Does anyone have any advice on how to raise a complaint against a company not listed on the better business bureau? I've posted previously but we had a rental booked through HomeAway and the owners are AMI BEACH Club. Have been in touch with the owner directly (Valerie Clark) who is refusing our requests for a refund and also raised a complaint with HomeAway directly (who urged AMI Beach Club/Valerie Clark to offer the refund). Surprised they aren't listed on BBB as they own a number of properties on the island. Thanks in advance.
"Actually the original posts about Anna maria Vacations are still there...the rather weird post about skiing in New England for Easter (which we would always do in Stowe and was always great..picnic in the snow, beautiful weather, soft corn snow, awesome sunrise service at the top, the ski down in bunny ears) was removed.If the company has changed its mind it is possibly because efforts here and by complaints to the BBB and AG,I think this is a valuable thread and good resource for travelers."
"Anna Maria Vacations are refusing to give back refunds due to Covid-19 even though Florida is not allowing shorty term rentals at this time.Previously, they said if they could re-rent our week we would get refunded. we decided to keep our reservation even though beaches, restaurants etc The whole state on a stay at home order. Now all short term rentals are prohibited. We were supposed to check in on 4/18/20. We were forced to rebook for next year or loose $7500.00. Disgracefull. DO NOT RENT FROM ANNA MARIA VACATIONS!!!!"
We had the same experience.... they finally wore us down.We have put in an official complaint with the city of Anna Maria and the Florida AG’s office.DO NOT RENT FROM ANNA MARIA VACATIONS!!!
"Update ~ Anna Maria Vacations agreed to refund our short-term rental after we contacted the Florida Attorney General's office and the Mayor of Anna Maria's office. Our rental was scheduled for April 12-19 -- after a month of failed negotiations with Anna Maria Vacations regarding a refund or at least partial refund, I called Anna Maria Vacations on April 11 to let them know that we saw the extension on the order from the Florida Governor that extended the short-term rental ban, therefore they could not legally check us into our rental the following day. Keep in mind that on April 6th Anna Maria Vacations had sent me links to island webcams so that I could see that even though the Anna Maria Island beaches were closed, there were still people enjoying them. I found this extremely upsetting that this company was promoting an idea that my family should ignore our own federal, state, and local governments' shelter-in-place orders, in addition to the State of Florida and AMI's own shelter-in-place orders, and come on down, stroll past the beach closed sign, and set up camp on the sand with my family. Unbelievable. I realize that AMI homeowners and full-time residents are still allowed to use the beaches, but my family and I do no fall under that category and therefore would not legally be allowed on the beach. I realize that rental companies and rental home owners have bills and mortgages to pay, which is why I was negotiating for even a partial refund. But though our situation ended favorably for us at the last minute, I would STRONGLY discourage anyone from ever using this company in the future. And to those still hoping for a refund, the Florida Attorney General's office was extremely helpful and kind and would gladly take the information of anyone dealing with a similar situation, especially with this particular rental company. Hopefully soon this whole thing will be in the rear view mirror and we can all take these much anticipated vacations!!"
We have a rental booked with Anna Maria Vacations May 30-June 6. I haven’t started the fight with them yet but hopefully all the bad press is going to make them more responsive to rescheduling our rental or getting a refund.
"The rental companies are bad enough, but what is the deal with the actual owners of the properties? I know people who are exposed to multiple COVID-19 positive patients daily. If they are not symptomatic, have reservations, and are refused a refund...chances are they will be using their paid reservation. What homeowner would want this in their home?? It's truly mind boggling."
"You were lucky the number of times including my own insurance company they all seem to think you can claim off someone else! I have heard every excuse going! So with this in mInd we cancelled the whole holiday lost £600 our villa owner refused to give £200 back their right usual response claim off your insurance. The only good thing cancelling I have certainly learnt who I will not be using in future. Goodwill “unprecedented “is lacking, but greed survival is plentiful. I am hugely relieved to cancelled and keep my £5k loss £600 good luck. Fairness goodwill hard to find."
Well I had hoped Anna Maria Vacations would have stepped up and done the rIght thing after all the negative publicity and complaints to the Attorney General and BBB. I had a rental reserved for May 30. When this all started I called them and they told me they were working on reservations that were happening sooner and to please wait until April 30 to call back and make other arrangements if necessary. I waited patiently and continued to check the availability of our property for possible dates to reschedule. On April 30th I saw that 3 of the weeks in June and July I was looking at were now booked. I called and asked to move my dates to the only week left in July that would work for us due to my son’s graduation that had to be rescheduled to two possible dates in June and July. At first they weren’t even going to let me reschedule and told me to continue to wait. I told them I worried that if I waited any longer that the one available week would also be booked. Savannah helped me and was very kind and helpful. I don’t blame her. She was only doing what she was told by the further ups. She was finally able to get them to agree to change my dates however that week was $600 more than our original dates. They refused to work with me on the difference at all. I understand this is not their fault nor is it my fault so I didn’t expect them to necessarily eat the entire difference but for the sake of customer service I would have thought they would have at least split the difference with me. This is my son’s senior trip and we have saved for over two years to be able to do it. If I could afford a place that was $600 more I would not have been booking the property that I did. I have seen on BBB others with the same issue and it looks like they eventually worked with them only after people made complaints. I would have hoped that we could’ve worked it out without me having to make a complaint and I told them so much but I guess not.
"I have been fighting with Anna Maria Vacations for a few days now. They cancelled my May 2 reservation due to the governors restriction on short term rentals. Anna Maria Vacations has been holding people’s money hostage and only offering credits instead of refunds. I have received refunds on my airfare and rental car but not with these crooks. I’m not interested in booking another vacation with the current situation so I wanted a refund. After being told I can’t have a refund and after complaints with the Florida attorney general and a claim with the BBB, they still refuse. Please avoid using this company for your vacation rentals. These people are thieves."
"Vacasa. Same thing. No refund, only offering credit. Will never use again."
"Trip Insurance will not cover the trip unless the travelers dies previous to trip or has covid at the time of the trip. If Florida is under a state of emergency -15000 cases the other day--why is the company allowed to hold my family's health as hostage? The courteous thing to do--and I lost $8000 on a weeks rental this week, is to offer another week in the future or give a half refund, allowing both parties to be vulnerable. I am 60 and my husband is 70, we are retired and have no way to make up the money we saved for 2 years for this family vacation home. That being said, I know business owners are vulnerable but often wish common sense would prevail in times of pandemic."
I would love a credit--I am out $8000 this week!
FYI I rented a house back in September 2019 for this coming week July 18-25. My final deposit was due originally mid June but was extended till July 2. We decided due to the spiking in Florida to cancel on July 1. Much to my pleasant surprise I was given a 100% refund!!! I booked a rental through this site trip advisor. I’ll be using them from now on!!!
"Anyone have advice on getting out of a rental due to Covid? I rented from Anna Maria Vacations and they say unless there's a shut down from the governor, they are not offering refunds or even changing dates. I'm happy to let them keep my money if they will let me change my September date for one next spring. So far, I've had no luck. Just wondered if anyone else has had success with them.Thanks."
"We reached out to the Attorney General and we’re told we were unable to get our money back. Needless to say, we will not be using the rental company again that we’ve used for the past 5+ years."
"So many questions Christy L? Any details? Who, what, when, where? Reasons? First time ever here.... To what end?"
We use Coastal Cottages AMI and reached out to them first. They Told us they wouldn’t give us our money back so we contacted the Attorney General. After about a week we just found out that we cannot get our money back. It’s very unfortunate because our 6 year old has a very low immune system and it wasn’t a choice for us to go to a Florida and risk our sons life.
"When I booked rental house back in June for Marco Island trip in July, I purchased Travel Insurance just in case, especially in the COVID-19. I can't predict what happens until the date I travel. I'm glad everything turned out ok two weeks ago when I was in Marco Island."
"Identify thieving owners and VRBO before deposits are paid.Jul 28, 2020, 2:27 PMSavedTripAdvisor should let us post reviews at the rental properties' sites where deposits have been stolen after renters had to cancel due to the covid-19 virus travel hazards. We could not stay at the one that stole our deposit along with VRBO, and thus we cannot leave a review and warn renters not to make deposits.VRBO is stealing deposits world wide while advertising that they are returning them! People need to see this upfront at advertised rental sites at TripAdvisor.Do not rent a property from Kim Dennis nor VRBO!I gave over 4 months notice that we can not travel safely and cancelled our reservation and cannot get my deposit refunded. VRBO has done nothing to get me my refund. VRBO sells travel insurance that it recommends and travel insurance does not cover the Covid-19 Virus cancellations! I can't believe how VRBO can operate fraudulently and so openly to steal reservation deposits for owners of vacation properties, like Kim Dennis, and VRBO! The Florida Department of Regulation and Licensing said they cannot get my deposit of $1,715,84 refunded. As Kim Dennis has continued to rent her properties in Florida during the Governor's shut down of private vacation rentals due to the covid-19 Virus, I have requested an investigation be conducted to revoke her business license for operating unsafely and illegally.

"William H, I agree that travel insurance doesn't cover COVID-19 per se, but we were able to get a refund through our trip insurance by proving it was unsafe for my husband to travel by getting a statement from his physician stating he is immunocompromised.Edited: 8:47 pm, July 28, 2020 "
"Your travel insurance will not cover your inability to travel due to the Virus.In general, it is worthless. Everybody is losing their deposits! VRBO sells the worthless travel insurance and VRBO does not give refunds all around the world as they advertise that they do. They are thieves along with the property owners that will not approve the refunds!"
"Just our ages of 72 and 81 should be enough to get our refund. No, Kim Dennis, the property owner, nor VRBO, the booking agency nor any of the worthless Florida State agencies that should pull their licenses and penalize them big time for not returning the deposits, do what is right. This scam continues to go on and on."
"My husband is 79 with leukemia. Booked through Airbnb, but total refund was from our trip insurance company."
"I have heard that at least some Airbnb deposits were being refunded. VRBO is not refunding unless the property owner approves, and guess what, many of them are not approving.Your are lucky."
"Yes, we are. Trip insurance reimbursed us for 2 concerts and 2 vacations we had booked. Also, however, Airbnb has been wonderful throughout the pandemic. Their policy is on their website, but basically as long as you booked before 3/14/20 and your checkin is between 3/14 and 8/31/20, you are covered by their cancelation policy as long as the check-in date has not passed."

William Harper, Linwood, MI, 6/27/2020 As of 6/29/2020, The Fl Attorney General has not taken any action. This scam by VRBO and Kim Dennis goes on and on without the state warning people not to give deposits to these thieves."
Just our ages of 72 and 81 should be enough to get our refund. - There is no reason to refund simply because of age.As long as the owners and VRBO are complying with the terms and conditions that were agreed by the renter they are not doing anything illegal and are not stealing anybody's deposit.
"Maybe not illegal according to the letter of the law, maybe not technically stealing but certainly immoral. I understand the frustration, and if all else fails post the company or name. Also if a company does finally refund be sure and post that.To simply state the facts in detail is not wrong."
Kim Dennis has continued to rent her properties in Florida during the Governor's shut down of private vacation rentals due to the covid-19 Virus. That is illegal.
"""Kim Dennis has continued to rent her properties in Florida during the Governor's shut down of private vacation rentals due to the covid-19 Virus. That is illegal.""That may or mat not be the case but that is an entirely different issue from your earlier claims of illegality which related to deposit refunds - it isn't illegal to simply stick to the agree terms and conditions which set out the rights of both parties.I fully appreciate that the pandemic wasn't your fault but equally it wasn't the fault of the property owner.A good owner may feel morally obligated to provide a refund or some form of credit but that's an act of goodwill if it's not a requirement of the agreed terms."
