Is anyone still planning on traveling to Santa Ponsa or Majorca?My flight is on Tuesday 4 August and am undecided on what to do?Would be good to hear what others thoughts are?Also is it still busy at the moment with plenty of bars and restaurants open? Grateful for people's views and updates.Thanks
"Hi. Andrew. Everyone makes their own decision whether coming , if able to fly , and having the 14day quarantine on their return. Or are you not sure if it will be busy enough. In SP Brits are only a part of the tourists as there many nationalities with Germans by far one of the biggest and there all season including winter. The resort has been busy with far more places open and people than here in Magaluf / PalmaNova."
Hi we are quite lucky as the 14 day quarantine is not really an issue for us. I work from home and my wife is a teacher and does not start back till Sept.I guess it's just travelling against FCO advice which is playing on our minds.
Insurance being invalid is a factor in cancelling this year due to the fco advice can rebook for may next year
Thanks getting stranded and no flight home is obviously top of my worry list.In terms of falling ill I thought we were covered through the EHIC?
"We travel to cala bona, fly tomorrow nite, lots open bars etc, carnt wait."
"Hi Andrew. Hope you and others don’t mind me chipping in. The EHIC covers you for healthcare until 31 December this year. So, if you are in an accident and need an ambulance and hospital treatment it will cover you. Also if you need a prescription you will be able to see a doctor at a local health centre, but will have to pay for the items prescribed at a farmacia. Now the bad bit. It will not guarantee that anyone who treats you will speak any English. You might need to get a translator in a worst case scenario. Family may need to supplement your care and bring food if you are in hospital. If you need to be repatriated to the uk that will be at your expense. All these things are hopefully not going to happen, but worth while knowing. Cheers"
"If you break your arm slipping by the pool (or get sick with Covid) the immediate medical care will be covered with your EHIC as Quality says. However that is only part of it. Paying for new flights if you have to miss yours - for all of you unless they leave you there alone - will not be covered; nor will extended hotel stays, taxis etc. There are underwriters (through brokers) that cover for travelling against FCO advice. You'd need to research it. Or just take a gamble. Only you can decide if it's worth it."
"Slightly off topic but the question “is any one still going“ but worth mentioning. I am sure you will do your best ,if you manage to come ,observing all the different things they do on this island to protect you such as wearing masks , etc , etc with signs everywhere including your hotel. This is the very first time seeing the ‘pints of milk’ new arrivals wandering about wearing no masks this evening. An English family came into gym this morning plenty visual signs for the member to sanitise equipment before and after each use- quite simple and not difficult. On and off various stuff and had to be reminded by staff - just a blank stare. Rant over but it did really annoy me .Been going there over a month now and so far been safe as all others observe keeping others safe. The locals on the islands for the last few months have done their best to keep the infection spread down hoping it stays that way for people to holiday. If you decide and manage to come have a good holiday."
"Yes. On Saturday assuming my flight isn’t cancelled. Got EHIC, got extra cover from battle face and prepared to pay for extra flight/accommodation if worst came to worst."
I don’t think your covered if fco says no travel. The advice is because of covid so if you got it you’ve gone against the advice and travel at your own risk. Not 100% but that’s what I’m lead to believe. I would check with your insurance. You no what insurance are like. There are so many claws.
Goanewyear - what is the extra cover via Battleaxe. Can you give me some more details please?Thanks
Sorry typo - meant battle face!

"I’m in Paguera. Been here since Saturday which was the day govt changed their guidance. About 6 hours after we arrived. Here for another 8 days. Feels completely safe. Safer than UK. Atmosphere is very good. Most are respectful of masks. Sanitiser at all bars, restaurants and shops. Pretty quiet. Getting quieter here by the day I would say probably 20% capacity or feels that way. But plenty open to enjoy yourself and eat and drink. Beaches and pools have loads of space. Weather is very hot just now. 39 degrees today.Quarantining is a real pain. But when we came it wasn’t in place and Balearics have had one case in past 3 days. Crazy imo. If you are coming you will have an enjoyable time. It’s lovely here and feels very safe. Enjoy."
Andrew c they provide cover to places FCO day no travel to. They include Covid related illness but not Covid related cancellation etc. My main priority was to have adequate accident and illness cover from a company who specialises in FCO red zones!
Voyager also do it but everything Covid related is excluded. Our 4 person policy was £76 for a week.
Ok thanks. What extra do you get with that cover over and above the EHIC?
Andrew..basically private medical care rather than state hospital. Just gives more options about where you are treated. Much like nhs here versus private.
"Also stuff like loss of baggage, theft etc"
I'm in Santa Ponsa now. Safest we have felt for 4 months. Bars are fairly busy still. Plenty of non British people about who can still travel here.
"Not Santa Ponsa but we're flying to Majorca this coming Saturday. We're not from the UK; Switzerland has yet to place Spain on the quarantine list. But even still, we will quarantine for at least a week when we go back home."
"Yes still going , got insurance with battleface thanks to posts on here, a big thanks for that., quarantine when get back."
Fair play to you. It will be well worth it. We are having a great holiday. The masks haven't been as we thought they would be. I knew the quarantine rule when I flew here. It has been well worth the 14 days when we return. Its feels so safe here. Far more so than my local Asda for example!
Same as post 24. Leave tomorrow for Puerto Pollensa.
"We are due to travel to Santa Ponsa end of September and at this moment in time we will only go if the quarantine when coming back to the UK is dropped as we cant do that because of work etc.Fingers crossed we can travel. We are also in Majorca in January, so fingers crossed for that one too!!"
Update from Paguera. The resort is now completely dead. It was fairly quiet anyway but the last few days have seen people depart and far fewer to replace them. Streets empty. Just strolled back along the beach front at 10.45pm and no one about. Economy and jobs will crash. So sad to see.
"@HarryW I am supposed to be travelling to Port de Pollença on Wednesday (from Berlin) and was wondering if you could give me an update on what the atmosphere is and in comparison to what it normally is? I've never been to Mallorca and unless Germany adds a quarantine in the next four days (knock on wood), will be going. Hope you enjoy your time there!"
I think with jet 2 cancelling all flights and telling people to book a flight home before Monday this has made it worse still for the business's of Mallorca.
"Santa Ponsa is still fairly busy, especially at night. We went to Las Olas last night a popular restaurant by the sea front and it was full outside the whole time we were there and so were the other restaurants nearby."
"Bronwyne, this is day two of my holiday and I am a little more positive. August in Puerto Pollensa is usually busy to the extreme. Restaurants generally have to be booked in advance,and service is often less than expected. You wont have to book a table. 9 pm this evening, was perfect walking along the pine walk. The area was quiet busy with a very nice, chilled atmosphere. For me this is preferable to the normal Augusts in PDP. The town is certainly not dead. The only downside is my hotel is very quiet. We were the only family around the main swimming pool today. Although it is nice to have the pool to ourselves! We spent an afternoon in Cala San Vicente (7 kilometers away) today. The area was unexpectantly vibrant with a lot of Spanish families. The sea as always was absolutely stunning. A must visit if you are in the area. I'm sure you'll have a nice time."
"I can second what Harry said, we arrived in PP today, busier than I thought but still nice and calm. If you want a 7.30 table for dinner I would book as it’s family eating time and was busy tonight. Very very hot today!! Had a good journey and feeling very relaxed."
"Problem isn't so much Brits going as Spanish from the Peninsula. Im booked for a fortnight from mid Sep and hoping the quarantine is lifted before then, Feel its a lot safer than Sheffield city Centre!!!"
Thanks AllWe are def going on Tuesday for 12 nights (as long as our flight is not cancel led last minute) and I have took out the Battleface insurance
"I've given up. Too much uncertainty over flights being cancelled/moved around, hotels closing/move you to another hotel, to quarantine or not.Picked up a deal to Rhodes, I'm going this Saturday. I'll be back though ;-)"
"The situation is SO fluid though, that it's impossible to know what to do. I read this morning that there have been more cases in Greece over the last few days and the Government there are talking about reviewing their policies. And if that's the case then quarantine may be introduced in UK for returning holidaymakers.Hoping now we make it to Ibiza on 24th.....(changed my mind since yesterday!!)"
"Belgium, Andorra, & the Bahamas, have been added to the FCO quarantine list tonight.It's an evolving situation on a daily basis for sure."
"Here's a link to an interesting chart, showing how the various European Countries are averaging out new cases over the last 14 days. Spain and Romainia are in the 80's, UK is just over 14.Luxembourg off the scale at 187.Greece is well low at 8.4.https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
"Hi to all :)We are booked to fly out from Scotland with Ryanair on 30 August for 3 weeks.Private accommodation booked so no issues or costs if we don't travel and a car hire can be cancelled, also at no cost.Like most, we love the island and in normal circumstances we'd love to go. However, we wont travel against government advice even though many think the embargo on the Balearics is inappropriate.I had a webchat with Ryanair today and just thought I'd share in case anyone else may be in same boat (guess that should be plane !)While they are offering (in certain circumstances) a ""free"" flight change, they add on a baggage moving charge. Also, if you had hold luggage booked on the original flight and no longer require it they do not offer a refund. Additionally, if the seats you had booked on the original flight are not available on the new flight they make a charge for changing the seats.I know I know I know, if you don't like their T&Cs don't book but I didn't think even they could stoop so low......"
"At #40, the stats are all there and people still say its safer in spain than their hometown,spain will be back in phased measures by early september when the great spanish getaway is over.Atb steve"
What is the insurance you got?
"Similar to #42 - we have recently chosen 'not' to visit Mallorca as planned this Aug/Sept.Very difficult decision as we 'want' to go there but (after changing our minds daily) there are just too many negative factors incl government advice, quarantine, infection rates, medical aspects, insurance etc; and we're seniors hence potentially vulnerable. Rental will be transferred to next year, a great gesture.Like #42 we are flying with Ryanair and our to/from flights continue to depart daily. Hoping they cancel the flights - but I doubt that will happen - so it will be our loss of £££s. We had paid for hold luggage and reserved seats, but accept their t's & c's.First time we have ever had to cancel a holiday. Don't like doing it as we were so looking forward to being back in Mallorca (and supporting the local businesses)."
Hi Lucy #44. Battleface was the insurance company that had been mentioned a few times. There are plenty of threads for you to make up your own mind if you plus 5 including kids are going to take the risk against FCO advice and travel. The only reason I have reminded you is if had you read all the recent threads and statistics you probably wouldn’t have posted your question. I do hope everything works out for you if you travel and if not you manage to minimise loss or manage to rebook. Stay safe.
"I can also add that we will of course be quarantining now for 2 weeks, but we’re lucky we can work from home and it was worth it. However the UK government forms we completed prior to our return were not requested by anyone. (On arrival at Palma on 25th July our QR codes were scanned and temperatures checked) I’ll be interested to see if anyone contacts us in the next 2 weeks."
"Leonie. #47,48 A pretty good update of how your holiday experience was informing as you see procedures in place arriving , during ,then your return flight and more so how you felt while out and about on holiday. Some might still be lucky when / if quarantine is lifted , their flight still on etc etc as the holiday will be different but enjoyable. Weeks ago when there seemed a chance holidays might continue there was still all the negativity of how bad a holiday would be having to observe what was in place to keep people safe. I stand to be corrected but haven’t yet seen a negative post of ones holiday experience. Stay safe."
"Hi allThought I would give an update to help people make their own decisions.We are currently in Santa Ponsa after arriving on Tuesday 4 August. Our flight out was with easyJet and only approx 20 people on board. It felt strange but we actually enjoyed the empty plane! We arrived 30 mins early and then had a private transfer to Santa Ponsa.We are staying in Portofino apartments which are quite full. The receptionist told us the Deyo apartments are closed and bookings transferred to Portofino hence why it is closed.I would say 70% of pubs and restaurants are currently open. Not many British around but lots of Spanish, French and German. The resort is fairly lively but obviously no where near as busy as what it would normally be like.We do feel safe here. The vast majority of people are wearing masks and good procedures are in place for Covid (QR code menus in restaurants etc).Our holiday does feel different to normal, but actually we are enjoying it, and taking advantage to do things we would not normally do in August (staying on beach to sunset, bike rides, a few evenings in etc).Overall we are really pleased we came and we did take insurance out with Battle Face.As previously mentioned our circumstances mean that the 14 day quarantine is not an issue for us but I get this is a non starter for some people. Therefore this is simply my honest assessment of what it is like being here at the moment to help people make the decision which is right for them."
