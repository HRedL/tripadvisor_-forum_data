"My neighbor just came back from Orlando.He said he got sick after few days arriving in Orlando.Maybe he caught it from plane or from visiting parks but it was like Flu like symptom.He visited doctor of hard time breathing, high fever, coughing and body aches. Doctor would not test him for Corona-virus. Doctor said treat it as Cold.Has anyone been able to test for Corona virus successfully in US? Or is that doctors do not know how to test for the virus?"
"Love the fear mongering from a new poster. There’s no plausibility here. Yes, they can test and I can imagine no scenario where, if the symptoms warranted, that they wouldn’t have tested. Do some reading over on the CDC or some legitimate news sources."
"I've gotten sick several times after visiting Orlando long before Coronavirus came along. It's just what happens when you're in such a place with so many visitors from everywhere.Most likely it's flu or respiratory infection, but it is what it is. They are testing for the virus in folks who have been overseas, but only one case so far has been linked to non-overseas contact."
Of course doctors know how to test for it in the US or we wouldn't have diagnosed cases....maybe your neighbor should get off WebMD and let the doctors do their job instead of trying to self diagnose.
"Sooooo, has your neighbor been to their Doctor yet ? Was the US Doctor correct ?"
"Yes, he visited doctor twice since he had gotten worse.My neighbor clearly had symptom for corona.My question is very simple. Have you or know anyone who you see regularly tested for corona virus from visiting doctor in US?It is Yes or No question.Edited: 8:47 am, February 28, 2020 "
"At this point, the CDC is NOT testing for flu like symptoms if there has been no history of travel to or contact with the areas the CDC has designated. You don't state if the person was tested and retested for flu or strep. STOP THE FEAR MONGERING."

Where was he coming from? Also are there any more symptoms? Has he been taking any medication? I would advise to keep your distance until this Coronavirus blows over. There are no confirmed cases in Florida and I pray that it isn't one. I hope your neighbor gets well.
"A neighbor has the flu in the winter? Shriek! Gulp! Shock! Horror!When symptoms locally are determined to be harmful or life threatening, I will take them seriously. Until, then, I will laugh at those that cannot enjoy life when they have the opportunity to do so. That includes those fear mongers that enjoy creating panic among others that live in shi**y places.Just because we have a moron that lives in the White House and several news agencies that make money from panic, it does not mean that a country has to panic for no reason, yet.On the good side of the panic after the pain of the stock market crash, maybe people will find suppliers that won't steal their technology."
If he can get to the doctor by himself it's not the flu.
No need to panic but be chary.
"Answer: NO.It seems like it is difficult to test in US. Checking from CDC site:"" The test will not be available in U.S. hospitals or other primary care settings. The kits will be distributed through the International Reagent Resourceexternal icon (IRR)""Hope he/she doesn't have serious illness and recover."
You asked to reopen this thread? Why???
"I read an article yesterday that there were some issue with the testing kits that was affecting distribution. Also, after the case in CA, the CDC has broadened the testing parameters."

"surffishFLAPlease leave politics out of it. There are so few places one can go anymore and not have to hear someones point of view on politics. I have my view just like you have yours and that is great. But please, lets leave this be a place where people can come and get away from that. After all vacations and travel should be a happy event. Right?And obviously the OP is some troll posting non sense on here. So lets all get back to planning vacations! We had to cancel our vacation last weekend due to a change our youngest's school made so I am a little down in the dumps right now. Should have spent last weekend on the beach. But only 17 days until we head for the beach again!surffishFLA - I LOVE FLORIDA and the relaxing pace of life there. So jealous that you live there. The warmth and ocean are so calming."

Well if you go the Coronavirus you would know it.
Jordsnbulls lots of asymptomatic people so no not necessarily would you know it. I think you are probably just joking but it’s important to know people can have coronavirus and feel fine.
"""2nd round of lockdowns start in China ..."" - from youtube today.As I have mentioned on another thread, be careful of getting corona virus tested. Best is to wait for home kit to become available. Second wave is coming so be prepared."
"In CT, i know someone who had the signs of corona, went to the e.r. and they wouldn't test him and put him in a shared room with someone. This was just last week....doctors at the hospital were not allowed to make the testing determination on their own because of a shortage of tests. This is what his wife was told by the doctor."
