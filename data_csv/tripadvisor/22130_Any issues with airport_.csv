We are still planning on flying to Cartagena on Friday. Are there any issues at the airport caused by the coronavirus?
We plan on flying in on friday too. Im extremely concerned and hopefully there aren't any issues.
"Everyone, please post your arrival experience and any updated news. We're trying to decide if it's wise to keep our reservations for next week. Entering Bogota,Edited: 8:22 am, March 12, 2020 "
Yeah I’m freaking out a bit. There are very few reported instances in the entire country. I’m probably more concerned about getting back in the US

"We arrived Monday March 9th, 2020 no issues - smoothly thru immigration - have all your documents like Passports, info of where you are staying. The city is very alive & busy. It’s wonderful! Enjoy your stay!"

"One can only presume that health officials will err on the side of caution. As such, a false positive for someone from a high risk country could easily result in a compulsory isolation."
The travel company just cancelled my trip for tomorrow. Too many travel restrictions. So the decision had been made for us.
"I’m in Cartagena right now, I flew in last Friday (March 6th) from FLL. Going through customs there were no problems, they simply just asked if I had any symptoms and checked my passport for stamps from Italy or China."
"Hi, do you know if the compulsory medical testing applies to transit travelers? We are leaving from US to Cusco and have a 65 minute layover in Bogota. Thank you for any response."
I just left today after a lovely few days. If I could go back tomorrow I certainly would. My understanding is that they’d still take me!
"Hello!! I just flew into Bogota from the US and had no problems!!! Before immigration, there were two people taking temperatures. After that, we waited about 30-35 min to get through immigration. They're passing out the health form that you can fill out online. We filled it out online and in person on paper. Immigration was easy too. All in all just hoping the trip goes as planned and I can get back just as well! Good luck"
"I flew nonstop from Miami to Bogota and they had me fill out the questionnaire and did the test. I'm not sick at all but since my permanent residence is in Washington, they will not allow me into Bogota unless I self isolate for 14 days at the hotel. My vacation is ruined and it's my brother's wedding but I understand their reasoning. I'm currently waiting at the airport to fly back to the US. I hope they don't give me a hard time there once I get back. I'll keep you updated."
"Media are reporting long queues at Migraion level in Bogota Airport. Expect 1.5 to 2hrs waitline before clearing Migration. This is due to the additional controls: Temperature check, and health questions.For travellers from Italy, Spain, France, China, as stated above, there is a compulsory 14 days self quarantine."
"Please keep sharing updates! I'm also curious if it's life as usual. We fly out next Friday, March 20."
The travel company just explained that there were restrictions for people coming in from the US So they suspended all travel to Colombia. We were super bummed but it is better than getting there and being quarantined or stuck there. We will try again once this all settles down.
Sorry your travel company canceled!
They are a major tour company. Gate 1. We called Friday morning and all seemed okay but they cancelled by the afternoon. I fear it will only get worse.
PeaceA did you have any issues?
I’m in Salento these past few days with visiting family from Los Angeles California and this being a weekend I must say that there are maybe one half of the visitor’s/tourism here than I had expected.Just my unfounded and unscientific observation.
"But besides shortage in tourists, all is normal?"
"We're supposed to fly on the 20th too (from Chicago). Not sure at this point what to do... are you still going?BTW: we are a family of four. My wife and kids are US citizens but I have a European passport (I am a US permanent resident and my last trip to Europe was in June of last year). Could I face some troubles?Edited: 12:57 pm, March 14, 2020 "
We are 2 adults and 2 kids ages 8 and 10 years old. Flying Copa out of Chicago. We ARE planning on going. But I’m watching everything closely.
We might be on the same flight... Copa out of Chicago on the 20th
Do you know if the UK is ok? Due to fly out on Thursday 19th.
"I spoke with some guys from Houston who had just arrived, Friday, March 13th. They had to fill out a form and that was it"
It’s not false information. I really wanted to go on the trip but the tour company cancelled.
We are not going until May.We will be flying in on Interjet from Mexico City as we have a overnight layover there. I hope everything may settle down by then. Cartagena is on my bucket list.
"Like others state, better that you would visit another time as it is getting real here in Colombia.I just returned from a road trip with my mother and sister from LA, 7 day and 1,100 km driving trip from Medellin - Jardin - Jerico - Salento - Armenia - Honda - Dordal (Hacienda Napoles) - Medellin and last night in Doradal the hotels would not allow my mum and sis to stay as they entered Colombia/Medellin 10 days ago.Now back in my apartment in Medellin and not sure if I can take a few day trips with them in tow to Guatape and Santa fe de Antiouqia, for example.They are scheduled to return to LAX in one week but everything is fluid situation.Stay home."
Colombia shut its borders yesterday to ALL non Colombian residents and citizens. Colombia we’ll see you later this year I hope!
