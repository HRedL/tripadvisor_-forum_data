Today the British couple who have a holiday house in our village arrived. I’m guessing indirectly from the UK to Athens? I just hope they abide by the rules and self isolate for 7 days. I just hope Greece doesn’t suffer because of these loopholes and come June 15 and July 1 its only going to get worse!
"I fully understand your concerns, and sympathise. No doubt the local police will be checking up regularly on any new arrivals, (provided they are aware of them and I would have thought they should be). This must be a real worry for many people across Greece, which will only intensify after mid June when easing of restrictions apply. It is very difficult to forecast what the impact of tourism will be on the local population. Sadly, only time will tell.Edited: 8:35 am, June 07, 2020 "
I hope so too bigsnitch. They are our ambassadors right now!!
"Meanwhile, OP’s local community must make certain these people are organized with food and supplies.Yuri."
"Unfortunately unlike our other lovely neighbours they do not integrate and somewhat Lord it over the locals and don’t talk to anyone not even a “hello” so there will be no community spirit from us. The other houses are empty as their owners are all stuck elsewhere and unable to fly to Greece. You make your bed, you have to lie in it!!"
"..........Or starve in it as the case may be!! Of course, I don’t mean that. Hopefully, a telephone call to a shop will do the trick and no doubt the provider will add on a service charge for delivery to the door. It’s the best that can be hoped for in order to keep everyone safe during the self isolation period,"
Maybe they shopped en route. If I see them in my local supermarket I will not keep quiet.
"I hope they took sensible precautions if they did shop, like wearing a face mask to protect those around them, and they might well have done. Shame they have no desire to acknowledge others though, there are times when a kindly word or a simple nod go a long way. No need for sharing of life histories."
"""self isolate"" and ""self reporting "" at airports etc. is simply not going to work. Trying to figure out how this will all work and as more and more come will be next to impossible to monitor."
I wonder what route they took to get there from the UK. I didn't think there were direct flights to Athens (yet). Irresponsible in my opinion but I hope they are clear of SARS-Cov-2 for the sake of the locals.
">>Unfortunately unlike our other lovely neighbours they do not integrate and somewhat Lord it over the locals and don’t talk to anyone not even a “hello”<<Why are they there at all? Such ppl should be expelled immediately,"
We agree!!! To get a tan and show off to their mates!! We tried to make friends but they were offish so we gave up. Our neighbours said the same. We all go out for drinks and pet sit for each other but they don’t even smile when we pass. Each to their own I suppose.
"I agree to each to their own et c and understand that they don't integrate et c will probably make them unpopular. However much it goes against the grain, it will perhaps minimise any chance of cross contamination for the community to join forces and help the general population by taking the higher ground and getting the newly arrived the shopping they need and at the same time reminding them of the quarantine rules."
