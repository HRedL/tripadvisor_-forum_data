"Now it's starting to hit for real. No more Broadway, gatherings of more than 500, NBA, NHL, MLB suspended. This will hurt us. Feel bad for everyone this affects. Coronavirus in NY: Gov. Cuomo bans gatherings of more than 500 peoplehttps:/…Broadway shutting down all productions over coronavirus pandemichttps:/…MLB shutting down, expected to delay regular season amid coronavirus worrieshttps:/…"
"Have not been able to confirm but someone at my optician said Gov had invoked some sort of special power giving him power to order things like curfews. Have no idea if is true, but am currently standing in a line outside Trader Joe's waiting to get inside."
"I wonder if off Bway will continue. Capacity generally well under 500, but under new rules are allowed to seat only half capacity -- so if capacity 300, could only seat 150."
Little Shop of Horrors (270 seats Off Broadway) is going dark.
"“ so if capacity 300, could only seat 150.”Thinking of the little I know of the economics of the theater business...wouldn’t a show running at only 50% of capacity close down regardless of the reason?"
What about the likes of the Empire State or the Circle Line Cruises? We arrive on Monday (maybe not depending on the next few days) and wondering if anything will actually be open. Will restaurants/fast food places still be open?
"""What about the likes of the Empire State or the Circle Line Cruises? We arrive on Monday (maybe not depending on the next few days) and wondering if anything will actually be open. Will restaurants/fast food places still be open?"" I wouldn't count on tourist attractions being open. Honestly I would recommend cancelling. Restaurants will still be open, except at reduced capacity."
"Most off Broadway theatres are also shutting down for 30 days (at least). I have read Public Theatre, New World Stages, New York Theatre Workshop among many others are shutting down.More info:https://www.playbill.com/article/how-nycs-co…"
"#4 I agree, but sometimes there are other reasons for keeping a show going, and if they can get someone to sponsor, like trustee where is nonprofit group.Several important shows that were about to open will now close and may never reappear. The Laura Linney play (""My name is..."") that transferred from London. There is a new Tracy Letts play that was to open Sunday, I don't know where, whether on or off Bway. The long-awaited return of ""Lehman Trilogy"" after its short, sold out run at Park Ave Armory a couple yrs ago. I assume it took so long to get it back because of difficulty in scheduling those 3 lead actors."
"Ugh! :(This is not the news I was hoping. We have a trip scheduled for April 5th. Broadway, Statue of Liberty, One World, Yankees game, TOTR, Harbor Cruise, etc. The only positive feedback I received was from Statue of Liberty tickets stating tours are currently running as scheduled. Assuming everything will be cancelled by the time we get to NY."
"""wouldn’t a show running at only 50% of capacity close down regardless of the reason?""Would think so! Think the government would have to bail out many business to survive."

"There are public health laws that likely have not been involved for many years that allow the government to do some very serious things in times of epidemics. I do not know what specifics there are in New York City/ State, but they likely exist."
