"Hey! I’m traveling from Sweden to Melbourne next week (stopover in Doha) and I’m a bit nervous about the Coronavirus and if it will affect my travels... So I just wanted to see if anyone in this forum who’s in Australia atm can give me an update over the Coronavirus-situation? Do people have panic, stockpiling and stay inside? Is it risky to stay in a hostel? Etc etc. /M."
"I don't know how many people have contracted the virus in Melbourne, but there's only 25 in the entire country."
"Australia is as safe as it’s possible to be on the planet at the moment. There has been no community transmission of covid-19 in Australia. We have done as the experts here have suggested: don’t panic buy but gently accumulate by getting a few extra things with the shopping of non perishable food or other essentials to last a couple of weeks in case of logistics disruption if there is an outbreak. The authorities are prepared to identify and contain any outbreak should it occur, having been the first country to declare this a pandemic which triggers activation of the plan to deal with it quickly if it pops up in the community. So from the point of view of your safety while in Australia I wouldn’t be worried at all. Could you get stuck here or outside Sweden? I don’t think anyone anywhere on earth can make promises about that, but if you are travelling soon it appears unlikely."
Normal day or day life here. No need to panic. And FYI Australia is leading the chase for the antitidote!
"So far life is continuing as normal.We recently welcomed a friend from South Korea - at her home everyone has been asked to stay indoors. She transited Hong Kong where everyone was in full hazmat suits and arrived here to be waved through with a G'day.However although there are few cases here - Italy would have said that a week ago.So there are no guarantees.You could travel and nothing has changed or in the next week everything could be shut down.the hostel would worry me, - so many people from so many parts of the world, communal bathrooms almost like a cruise shipHowever the best defence is handwashing and not touching your face.Just bring your own sanitiser."
"CaT0ny, your friend from South Korea would worry me. People don't need to show symptoms to be infected and carrying the disease. Hostels are nothing like a cruise ship, unless they have buffets where who knows what people do.Malin, The only panic that we have seen is not buying, but selling on the Stock ExchangeEdited: 4:43 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"""communal bathrooms almost like a cruise ship""Huh? Never heard of a cruise ship with communal bathrooms."
Oh yes there are some Frommy.  Some of the older Antarctic expedition ships still have them though most are being phased out now and being replaced with new luxury ships.
"Malin, please do not use social media for reliable reports on the spread of Covid19. They are full of fake news and dire predictions. The best information comes from the World Health Organisation statistics. Look at: who.int/emergencies/…situation-reportsThis is updated every 24 hours."
"Yes, that is the sort of dire prediction we are getting from media based on information from unnamed sources. As you say, who knows what is true? I'll be sticking to the WHO for information."
Well the Australian government HAS named it a pandemic even if the WHO has not.
"I am in Aus and everything seems fine, no person to person transmission yet and people who have come from Iran in the last few days are being followed up. Masks and hand sanitizers are in short supply.. I think you have more chance of being hit by a car than getting it, and even the 89% of people get it mildly. If you were so unfortunate Australia has said ANYONE gets free medical treatment. Enjoy Aus."
"Yes, the bird has flown and situation is changing rapidly. It’s only a matter of time, but that applies pretty much everywhere."
"Travel to Australia is currently not dangerous. This is the sort of thing that makes people believe unsubstantiated rumours:A fake statement from Queensland Health circulated on social media warning people against visiting Brisbane areas with high Chinese populations.A few people from the Chinese community began an online campaign to protest what they saw as ""inappropriate"" labelling of COVID-19 as a ""Chinese"" disease by two newspapers, The Herald Sun and The Daily Telegraph.The Herald Sun published a headline that referred to the ""Chinese Virus Pandamonium"", while The Daily Telegraph highlighted ""China kids stay home"" in their headlines. Now someone in Australia has died from Covid19, we should expect to see more screaming headlines plus panic statements on Facebook and Twitter."
"If you want credible news you should not read Newscorp papers. No travel in Australia is not dangerous, but the OP asked for opinions not instructions from people resident here. A discussion ensues. I am sure those reading have the intelligence to take that for what it is....unlike numpties that boycott Chinese restaurants or particular communities within the country. The flip side of which is campaigns to get out and support Chinese restaurants and businesses. I have eaten more Chinese food in the past few weeks than I have in the past 3years.Edited: 9:03 pm, February 29, 2020 "
https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-he…Above is a link to yesterday’s statement from the offical Australian body responsible for making decisions about health emergencies. ...in which the say pretty clearly that it will arrive in Australia eventually but recommend measures to slow its arrival.
It's pretty pointless asking on a travel forum about coronavirus. The general public never know the full picture. Governments always hide the full story. It's entirely up to you if you think it is worth travelling. With all the different news circulating at the moment I'm pretty sure there's many more cases that's being admitted at the moment. But governments never tell the full story to protect their countries own interests. My thoughts are most people will eventually get it but it will just be like the flu. And most people will not even know they've had it.If you do travel here you'll have an amazing time.
20 people have died on South Australian roads so far this year and nobody is locking up all the cars0 have died from corona virusI don't see a reason to panic
"If you can’t trust governments and what they tell you and it’s pointless asking local people about what they are seeing and hearing in the ground, where are people supposed to get information? We have already been informed we also should not listen to the media. I guess we all just crawl under a rock and either live or die, but hey, we definitely shouldn’t talk about it."
"I appreciate the question! We are traveling in 3 weeks and I was curious about the level of panic in Oz also- just in terms of should we bring our own hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol.(it appears yes:)) For our last few days in Sydney I am forming a plan B in case the Royal Easter Show is cancelled, museums closed, etc at that point. Hoping it does not come to that. So looking forward to coming in a few weeks!"
We do have shops in Australia and many pharmacies. You can easily buy hand sanitiser etc here. Remember not to bring liquids over 100ml in your carry on luggage.
If you already have hand sanitiser bring it with you. A lot of places here have sold out.
"Yvwords, I meant more toward nozzie's point, that'd certain things would be sold out. I'm 5,000 km from any community spread here, but our shops are still out of antibac wipes and hand sanitizer. Thank you and I remain cautiously optimistic."
Lots of hand sanitiser in Sydney airport yesterday - with shelves out the front of the pharmacies. Together with masks at extortionate prices.Mask use noticeably decreased from when I was there a few weeks ago. Don't know if that to do with a more realistic risk assessment or just the price people are prepared to pay for masks..
"Unless you have a particularly specialised kind of mask, a mask will do nothing to prevent your getting the virus. It will, however, prevent you from coughing the virus out onto others if you already have it."
"Government, including PM have pointed out that the masks don’t stop you getting covid19 and asked the community not to waste them now when they are not needed"
Panic Buying 101 Luigi !!! ;)
Not much point in using a mask unless you are also wearing goggles.Viruses can easily be transmitted via the eyes as well as the mouth or nose.
"The virologist bloke from UQ specifically mentioned the scenario of lots of truck drivers getting sick, so not just imported things could be a problem if things get bad, I'm not saying they will get bad, but if we're talking about people panic buying, that would be one of the sources people may have been listening to. A quick check of pantries at our place and our daughter's place revealed that we are apocalypse ready as a permanent state of being. I reckon we could easily last 6 weeks without any difficulty at all. Though I have to confess to having added some UHT milk to my shopping last week. We'll even be fine for cooking and refrigeration if the power goes out for ages. OTOH, my daughter has been talking with friends and she's been shocked how many only have enough food in their house for 1 week. We just can't relate, but I can understand if you have kids to provide for and not much in the cupboard, you might feel like you need to put a few things away. Who am I to talk if they run to the shops now, . ...and don't even think about coming after our food stash people, my daughter and son in law were recently trained in axe throwing and they won the night. Turns out we are propper doomsday preppers and didn't even know it. Just waiting for Costco to start stocking AK47s then our bunker will be complete.Edited: 3:15 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Luigi, perhaps so but that guy has been getting a LOT of airplay."
"Yeah, because he is sensationalising this event and that is what the press wants."
"Well he's not alone either and even the Chief Medical Officer has explicitly not contradicted them. . from today's Guardian, but I've seen similar on the TV in press conferences:  ""Finally, Smith [boffin from WA] said, it would not hurt for people with children, especially, to have a couple of weeks’ worth of medication and food on hand in case someone in the family became sick and everyone needed to stay home from work and school. But she said this was no different to preparing for other infectious diseases, such as influenza. Stockpiling beyond that is unnecessary, Australia’s chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy said.""So we may sneer at people for running out and stocking up, and perhaps for going overboard, but when even the CMO is being quoted as backing up the advice, why on earth wouldn't they increase their home pantry from 1 week to 2 or 3.Luigi I don't think so, at least I haven't seen him say that. When I saw him he was trying to minimise things while still saying it's time to ""gently accumulate"" not panic buy.Edited: 4:12 am, March 02, 2020 "
Watching the ABC this afternoon and hearing the medical authorities are recommemending googles as well as masks.... Both of which the Government apparently has adequate stocks to issue.I wonder how the goggles will suit those with designer specs or if tinted goggles will be available for sunny days ahead?
Abstaining.
