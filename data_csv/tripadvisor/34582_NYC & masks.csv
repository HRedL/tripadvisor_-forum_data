Can you buy masks today in nyc? Will police enforce cuomo's rules on buses & subways??Be safe. Time to Reopen.
"You can easily make masks yourself by cutting old T-shirts. No need to sew. Let your fingers do the walking through ""google"" or youtube for templates. Creativity is a good way to pass the doldrums of this ""everyday is Saturday"" new normal."
"I have a face mask which is made from a bandana, 2 large rubber bands & I added 2 safety pins so that it doesn't open up as I'm wearing it. What you do is fold the bandana into thirds (like you were inserting a piece of paper into an envelope). Then fold the bandana in half along the long side. Then take the rubber bands, put the rubber bands through the two short sides to about a third of the way in, Fold the bandana short ends in towards the center & insert the ends into one another. I then take the safety pins & pin the folds on each side so that the folds stay together."
"With 2000 new cases going to a hospital yesterday and over 600 new deaths in one day in NYS, it is NOT time to reopen yet. I do not want to die, even though I am desperate to work. We have to bring this down quite a bit more. The governor explicitly said over and over (because reporters kept asking the same question) that there are no civil penalties at this time, because he believes New Yorkers will comply. But he reserved the right to implement civil penalties (fines) if necessary. The only reason we slowed this thing down is because people were home - we did better than all of the models for impact/infection. God help us if we go back too soon and it starts all over again. Let's not push this before we are prepared. And we do not have the mechanisms in place, yet, for businesses to reopen."
We are hearing from NYCEM and DOHMH it’s going to be more like September realistically. There are three metrics the City is tracking. It’s all on the City’s COVID website. It’s very easy for people in areas that are not hard hit to say “TIme to Reopen”. When you think about the fact that the hospitals are still struggling to the point you reallly —-don’t— want to need an ER anytime soon here. We are not ready. Keep in mind the lesson of New Orleans. They saw dollar signs and felt the pull of Mardi Gras. We can’t cancel Mardi Gras. And that decision cost them greatly in human life and reputation. Everyone desperately wants to get back to normal but not at such a great cost and in a way that puts us further backwards.
"Watching the President's new guidelines my guess is Upstate could reopen by May 1st, Long Island by May 15th, then NYC later. Good luck reopening by county!"
May 1? Get serious!
"You can buy face masks but not all places have them and they may cost much more than before. A box of 50 single use surgical masks that might have cost $10 at CVS before are simply not available anymore. Instead you might pay $2, $3 or even $5 for just one such mask, or maybe get a pack of 5 or 10 for $20 or $30. You are probably better off buying or making one out of a fabric like cotton or silk that you can wash. This would likely also be cooler in coming hot season."
"Also, while the NYPD might not be enforcing rules, don't be surprised if a New Yorker (or 2 or 3 or 4) tells you where you can go."
"Re: Pulling people off the train/bus.Philly did it, though fair being fair, they did bomb their own city, so they are a wildcard.https:/…About masks: I bought a 12 pack of jersey rags, basically bar rags. They tie like a mask from the back of the neck and cover the nose/mouth. I get a new one each day and then put them in the wash."
"#3 That is an easy way to create an appropriate face covering. It’s difficult to believe how many YouTube videos are out there showing various ways to make a mask. My only concern is that almost none of them address how to use them safely! I’m assuming that most people making masks from bandanas, or other fabric materials, are not going to use them only once. Not everyone will use common sense and information needs to be regularly provided about the risks associated with reusing cloth masks, or any mask for that matter. If the wearer is wearing the mask to protect others from becoming infected, in case the wearer is infected but still asymptomatic, they may not stop to think that during ANY outing their mask may itself become contaminated by another person, who may themselves be asymptomatic but not wearing a mask.The cloth masks must be worn for the duration of a person’s entire outing, and once they return home they need to be removed and stored safely in a paper bag (if they can’t be washed immediately) until they can be washed correctly, each and every time! Even the instructions on the CDC website doesn’t stress the need to wash after every use, but I think it should: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/do…Q: Should cloth face coverings be washed or otherwise cleaned regularly? How regularly?A: Yes. They should be routinely washed depending on the frequency.**I’ve read this on other sites as well, that cloth masks can be worn more than once before washing, but I personally wouldn’t want to take that chance."
Too late to edit #12The answer is missing “of use” at the end of the sentence...A: Yes. They should be routinely washed depending on the frequency* of use.
"""Also, while the NYPD might not be enforcing rules, don't be surprised if a New Yorker (or 2 or 3 or 4) tells you where you can go.""Hilarious, QQ2. I have a friend who comes home from walking her dog every day and texts a bunch of us, telling us how she yelled at people. She's a tad overzealous, but her heart and intentions are in the right place. I have never washed my wool gloves (in the absence of latex gloves) or designer scarves as much as I have in th last few weeks. Not to mention my very shiny keys! Who knew??"
i was having difficulty picturing how to put together the DIY mask mentioned above. I think this video demonstrates how to make a similar one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPx1yqvJgf4A bodega i walked past today had as sign they had masks and sanitizer but I didn't stop in so don't know what kind or prices.Used a vintage scarf - cotton that can be machine washed - as a face covering but the DIY one looks like it would fit a bit more securely
An Australian article about face masks;https:/…12130870
"Some stores, mostly food stores, have started requiring people to be masked to enter. I was in the line outside my local Morton Williams this afternoon when the line director pointed at a guy behind me and said he couldn't go in without a mask. The guy was upset and went up to talk to the director, who was adamant that the store manager said no mask, no enter (this store now also has one-way aisles, with arrows on the floor). I couldn't resist opening my mouth and told this guy he should take his windbreaker off and wrap it around his head, as I understood the city/state requirement was for a face covering over mouth and nose, not necessarily a mask. Apparently that rule hasn't yet taken formal effect and the line director insisted it had to be a mask. As the disappointed customer and his girlfriend walked off I suggested they call 311 and complain of discrimination. I can't imagine a store could get away with denying entry to, say, a Muslim woman with a head scarf.Not to mention the fact that a lot of the ""masks"" I have seen look really ratty & messy, like someone has been wearing them for a month."
"“ Keep in mind the lesson of New Orleans. They saw dollar signs and felt the pull of Mardi Gras. We can’t cancel Mardi Gras. And that decision cost them greatly in human life and reputation.”Well...not the reputation part, anyway. There were no calls by medical professionals or anyone else to call off the Mardi Gras celebrations. It was literally a case of horrible timing versus malfeasance or greed. “ Mardi Gras” is one day, of course. But the carnival season leading up to it is weeks long. There were massive parades on February 20-22. And that’s when things were pretty much life as usual in New Orleans. And New York City. And almost every other place in the country.“ But Dr. O’Neal blamed no one for failing to take action to limit Mardi Gras festivities. At the time, no cases of the virus had been identified in Louisiana and there were fewer than 50 known cases in the United States. “We were still talking about hand washing,” she said.Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, said there were other likely reasons, beyond Mardi Gras, that may explain why New Orleans has been hit so hard — the dense, compact nature of the city; its tourism industry; its port, which connects it to the world; and the way people connect culturally.”Above quotes from a New York Times article:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/corona…"
"For a bandana mask, you should take it apart & wash it every day. I don't know if you'll be able to find one for sale anywhere in NYS since the governor has mandated the wearing of masks anytime you go out where you'll be in proximity to others starting Friday 4/17."
"""Philly did it, though fair being fair, they did bomb their own city, so they are a wildcard. ""Seriously? That happened in 1972. Why not bring up that we threw snowballs at Santa?"
QQ2--same here. None at CVS. I guess China will ship the millions being held? Or we will have to make our own. Just like here in PA----we are NOT all like Philly. Alot of cows out here. Be safe.
"The reason glasses fog up is because your breath is coming up through the gap at the top of the mask, you need to close off that gap. It means it's not fitting your face properly. If you look at proper surgical masks they have a thin wire at the top that you can pinch to create a seal around the top of your nose. It also helps with being able to see properly over the mask.If anyone is making their own masks, you might like to sew in a thin wire of some sort at the top so you can pinch it around your nose. Something like a pipe cleaner might work, if that's what they're called in the US and elsewhere. They're used in crafts so should be easy to find?...Pipe cleaner: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_cleanerStrong twist ties might also work."
""". Apparently that rule hasn't yet taken formal effect and the line director insisted it had to be a mask. As the disappointed customer and his girlfriend walked off I suggested they call 311 and complain of discrimination. "" - Deblasio was telling stores to refuse people who don't have face coverings. He said face coverings though he didn't say it had to be a mask. Sounds like the store was being absurd in specifically requiring a face mask vs just a covering. Face masks are not easy to come by and if they will demand specifically face masks vs just something covering your face I don't think that should be allowed until the city provides a supply of masks for everyone in the city. The vast majority of people would wear masks if they had easy access to them, but like everything else that is in high demand they are in short supply."
"Presuming their paywall is down, the NYT had this article about the different types of masks and their value.https:/…"
Definitely do NOT plan on visiting th city or riding subways or buses without a mask even if self made is just way too dangerous to contemplate.
Mask isn't going to make a difference if others aren't wearing a mask either. Too many people walking around without masks. Inevitably the people who stand in the middle of the sidewalk texting on their phone and making people have to walk close to them to get by because there is no space are the ones that feel they don't need to wear a mask. Selfish individuals who don't care if they infect others. Then there are the people that that put masks on but then pull them down. If the mask is not covering your nose and mouth guess what? You are NOT wearing a mask. They probably exposed themselves to contamination ten times before they even got home.
