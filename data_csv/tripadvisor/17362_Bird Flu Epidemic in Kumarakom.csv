"Last week, an epidemic of bird flu was reported in Kumarakom and Alappuzha area. About 40,000 birds, mostly ducks, died. The government was planning to cull about 200,000 birds (ducks and chickens) to stop the spread of the epidemic to other areas. Since ducks breed in Alappuzha and Kumarakom back waters, is it safe to visit? I have planned for December 23 - 26, 2014 and planning to cancel the trip. The newspaper reports are alarming. Is there are any firsthand account of the situation? Any information will be appreciated."
It's safe to visit Kerala..just avoid eating chicken
"Things are in control now , about 80,000 ducks has been culled There has not been any report of it affecting the humans ,My personal suggestion is to go ahead with the trip"

Hello GuindianPlease check the post here on bird flutripadvisor.in/ShowTopic-g297631-i5501-k7966â€¦
"Well cooked food does not contain the virus. Nevertheless, it is not relevant because I am a vegan. Bird flu spreads from the bird droppings and not from eating the well-cooked bird. Since Alappuzha is the breeding ground for ducks, I have already canceled the Kunarakom trip :-(( I hope to come next December."
Hi Earthyroutes2Thank you so much :)
Now there is no bird flu or bird flu impacts in kumarakom or any part of kerala
