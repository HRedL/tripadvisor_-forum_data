"Planning to drive down to HHI from Maryland in early June. I've been viewing the various web cams and see virtually no one wearing masks, including restaurant waiters. Appears to be business as usual. In the Maryland/DC region we cannot enter a store or restaurant without a mask. Is what I'm seeing on the web cams the real story on HHI now? Is anyone wearing a mask? Might have to reconsider our trip."
"Smart people are wearing masks. There is no requirement for customers in most places to wear one, but most folks are."
We are from NY and heading down in 3 weeks. We will be wearing them.
"What I’m hearing it appears that masks really not very popular there. And as a result we will basically be social distancing while we’re there. That means we will not be spending as much money as we normally do at restaurants and shops. I guess the economy doesn’t need it because they have enough other tourists who don’t care. But I don’t believe anything has changed just because I’m on vacation. And I believe that I have a responsibility to protect others in case I have this and don’t know it. So I will continue to wear a mask and I will continue to patronize places that understand this.. It’s that simple.Edited: 6:45 pm, May 29, 2020 "
"We feel differently. We chose Hilton Head for a getaway in June because of the no mask requirement. If I am forced to wear a mask, it won’t be a vacation for me. Of course I will wear it if airlines are still requiring it but that will be the only time. We will spend most of our time outside and spread out. We will not go in any shops or restaurants that require them. We will spend money in those that don’t. I am very much looking forward to this trip and am going to blow through a chunk of our stimulus money."
Thanks for protecting other people.
"The coronavirus rate is still going up in SC, and people are still not wearing masks. Some of us are very afraid what will happen next. VIsiting soon is not a good or safe plan."

"For those of you who want to be responsible, I understand Whole Foods and fresh markets are requiring the masks. That is where we will be doing our grocery shopping for the stuff we can’t bring with us from Atlanta"
"Oh and by the way wearing a mask is not a sign of fear. Not wearing a mask and being in denial about what’s going on in the world that’s the true sign of fear. You’re scared to admit that your world has changed in so you’re trying to pretend that nothing has changed. If you want to know somebody who’s afraid see a mirrorWearing a mask is a sign that you care about people you encounter and thar you are not really selfish or in denial. Because the truth is you’re not wearing that mask to protect yourself, you’re wearing that mask to protect the chicken who’s afraid to wear one."
People who don't wear masks are selfish and make the world less safe for the rest of us. Fact. We won't be eating in our room because we rent a house so no worries. We will however be eating outside exclusively when we dine out and enjoying lots of tasty takeout. Cheers!
"I wear a mask when grocery shopping mainly to make others more comfortable, but the WHO does not recommend that healthy people wear masks unless one is taking care of a person with COVID-19:https:/…when-and-how-to-use-masks"
The WHO guidance has a huge problem. It tells you to wear a mask if you’re symptomatic. But everything that you see tells you the asymptomatic people are spreading this disease. So they are basically telling you to run around and spread the disease in advance because you should only wear a mask when you’re symptomatic. the truth is I could’ve given it to thousand people before I realized I had a symptom. So I’m being responsible and wearing a mask. I’m following the CDC guidance
"CDC guidelines vary significantly from WHO. Current recommendations are for everyone to wear a mask when going outside to congested locations, combining the mask with proper social distancing. Despite the bias from current administration actions, the CDC has continued to strongly promote mask usage by everyone to help break the Covid cycle.https:/…prevention.html"

Daniel -Nobody needs your permission to wear a mask and your post has nothing to do with Hilton Head. Those of us wearing masks are very secure in our decision. Thoughts and prayers (you will likely need them).
"You're right, not needed for healthy people. The problem with this virus is that a fairly large proportion of infected folks have no symptoms and without a mask, they can infect others. As far as the 20%, my experience shopping has been that it's more like 20% NOT wearing masks."
"We just returned from a week on hilton head island. We took everything we needed with us but my kids made a few trips to stores for a few things we ran out of. No one was wearing masks but them it seemed. We rented a boat and stopped in South Beach marina one day to buy a few t-shirts. Again, we were the only ones with masks on except for the 2 sweet ladies working in the t-shirt store. I was struck by the fact that they thanked us for wearing masks in their store.I definitely spent less money going places due to the lack of mask wearing by everyone."

"Wearing a mask helps seeming healthy people from infecting many others with COVID-19 which could be lethal. Masks protect others more then yourself. Maybe some think it’s your personal liberty to not wear a mask, but we should be able to go to a grocery store, etc without endangering our lives due to others ignorance. We depend on the trust & kindness of others to protect our well being. That’s part of being an American or human. It’s not your right as an American to Knowingly endanger lives of others, just because it’s a bit uncomfortable for you. Does it take those losing someone close to you from this deadly covid-19 for you to care?! With over 100,000 deaths, even 1 more is to much! Please think again ."
"I still cant believe how selfish people are for not wearing a mask in indoor places with close proximity. I live in the Charlotte area and only 10% of people wear masks in my area. I try to keep going out to a minimum, but sometimes you have to be able to go to the post office, grocery store etc. I grew up in an area which requires masks and is around the same population. Right now cases in the Charlotte area are skyrocketing, while the place I grew up in has less than 10 a day somedays. It DOES make a difference (esp with so many people not showing symptoms). You are wearing a mask for others not yourself, I don't understand why its so hard to grasp the concept.I know Hilton Head doesn't have a ton of cases now and hope it stays that way, but hearing all this, we will most likely stick to take out only (and bring most of our food) when visiting in June."
"We cancelled our vacation this week due to pool restrictions at our hotel and other restrictions in another area we intended to visit. Very few in our area wear masks. Many in our area have boycotted the one home improvement store that requires masks. The Lowes in our area has never been busier. I think judging doesn't help. If you want to wear a mask then you are protected and I should be able to go without one. My body, my choice.The one thing that this country needs right now is some compassion and unity. Put differences aside and enjoy life. If you are wearing a mask you should be fine. But let's stop the name calling and the put downs of those that do not see things the same way you do. That's what is great about our country. We all come from different areas with different ideals and beliefs.The best to all! Hopefully we can come visit the island one day. It looks gorgeous!"
"""If you want to wear a mask then you are protected and I should be able to go without one."" No, the mask protects you very little. The primary reason for one is to protect others if you are unknowingly infected, which, based on statistics, could be a 40% chance.If the ""other"" store is HD, then it's interesting that they require masks, since the founder is a huge support of the president."
"Nope, not home depot. Menards.Have a great day!"
"Ok, so I have read all the posts and it appears to have devolved into a debate about masks. I’m merely trying to gain an understanding of the policies/rules, not reignite a debate. I have picked up there is no mandate for citizens but is there a SC mandate that workers wear a mask? What about HHI? Is it left up to the business? If it’s left up to the business are there certain types that generally wear one (grocery, servers, etc.). I’ll make my decisions from there but I just want to be aware."
"Some restaurants like the salty dog cafe, call out specifically on their site that masks are optional for staff.https://saltydog.com/dine/kiwi.html"
"Your body, your choice. And you’re going to use that choice to infect others.But once again we have someone who so afraid of the new reality he’s chanitinx “ my body my choice” as if he’s being asked to abort a child. (You do realize how stupid you sound using that phrase for something as minor as a mask?) I know the new reality is difficult. But you can do it! you can face reality, you can’t be an adult, quit being so scared. I promise the mask will not hurt. Come on you can do it!! So when you see someone without a mask just remember they’re so scared they can’t face reality. So while you step away from them because they’re also trying to infect you with infectious diseases say a prayer for them. God knows what other stupid things are doing as they try to avoid realityEdited: 5:51 pm, June 02, 2020 "
"Carol – I understand you feel strongly on mask. You mention wearing masks is the new reality, do you anticipate everyone should still be wearing masks long term ? A year from now ?From the places I have been and other people I know that have traveled in different areas 80 – 90  percent are not wearing  masks indoors. So I take it you think 80 – 90 percent of people are scared and  can not face reality While you may disagree with Casey .I thought she made some good points and was trying to keep things civil. Good people can disagree."

You said exactly what I was thinking and couldn't put in words."
"Actually I expect that we are wearing masks for quite a while. In other parts of the world they seem to accept this reality better than we do. Americans are all afraid of the evil mask so we can’t wear it, but if you go to Asia it’s already pretty common for people to wear a mask. And guess what? they can breathe and they live and they’re not hiding in their homes in fear. They are being responsible citizens. You’re starting to see the same kind of requirements in other parts of the world. And in those places people are not hiding in fear from the mask. They’re putting the mask on and going on with their life. Americans however seem to be terrified of a piece of cloth over their face. Or maybe they’re terrified of being considerate. It’s a shame that Americans seem so scared of this piece of cloth. I feel very sorry for people who are scared and ashamed of being responsible for their own actions. But that seems to be where we are hereAnd I find it interesting that you say 80% of the people where you live aren’t wearing masks. I live in Atlanta and when I go to the store 80 to 90% of people are wearing a mask. I guess we’re braver here than you your town. Because we aren’t afraid of life and we aren’t afraid of being responsible for our own actions. If you’re not wearing a mask you’re either afraid of the mask or you’re afraid of being responsible for your own actions in my opinion because there’s no other logical reason.Edited: 7:43 am, June 03, 2020 "
"Carol - On the percentage I was not just talking about where we live but where we have traveled recently along with friends that have been in other areas including SC.I respect your opinion, I just thing we should let others make their choice without condemning them. for what they do."
"I have stayed out of this post until now because TA is a travel forum, and this post has become more of a personal debate about masks. Having said that, let me share the “policies” from the S.C. governor and HHI town council.There is no “mandate” to wear a mask for anyone, workers or otherwise. There is, however, statements from both governor and council that masks are strongly “encouraged” when in a public settings (as well as social distancing). With regard to restaurants, the industry has left it up to individual restaurants to determine their policy. Some restaurant staff wear a mask, some do not.With regard to stores, some will post a sign stating masks are required to enter, some make no statement.As a full time resident, who, actually has limited her public activities since March, my observation is that nobody wears masks on the beach and approximately 25 -40% wear masks in grocery stores (mostly residents, but some visitors). I do not eat out in restaurants now and no longer do take out since dine service became available so I have not directly observed mask wearing in these locales, but, obviously it’s tough to eat or drink with a mask.If you need an appointment in a medical facility, you will be required to wear a mask. I believe salons are also requiring a mask.I hope this information helps to gain an understanding of what is happening here and what the policies are.The rest is up to individual decisions.JEdited: 8:23 am, June 03, 2020 "
As another full time resident I echo many of Joannes sentiments. I do eat out regularly though but am opting for outside seating when I do. I won't call out specific eateries but have noted several that aren't requiring staff to wear masks are posting that servers will wear them when requested. Good Luck! WW.
"BTW, it is currently a requirement in Georgia that servers wear masks."
"Thanks Bearsfan for getting us back on track. I am finding lately that on any travel forum I go on, most posts turn into a mask debate. At any rate, we are booked to stay in Sea Pines the last week in July, so I am definitely interesting in preparing myself for whatever the requirements and/or expectations may be. As a point of reference, I live in Montgomery County, MD, which is one of the LAST counties in the country to relax any kind of restrictions, even though the state itself began several weeks ago. Masks here are required everywhere - in all stores, salons (which just opened June 1), etc. or you are denied entry. (Home Depot is one of them, for what it's worth). Do I wear one? Of course, it's required. That said, I sincerely hope it is not ""the new reality."""
Thank you for answering the question. I hate that this topic even creates debate. I’m just looking to adjust my vacation plans and wanted to know what to expect.
"I just spent two weeks in Hilton Head (Sea Pines) and it was wonderful. Coming from a section of PA where everything is still pretty locked down, it was a much welcomed escape and change of scenery. To answer your question, from my observations:Grocery Stores - Most people wore masks (I wore one)Home Depot and Lowes and other hardware stores (i bought a grill while down there) - Most people were wearing masks (I wore one)Gas Stations - Most people weren't wearing masks ( 50/50 me wearing one)Small Shops, Ice Cream places, restaurants, Harbor Town, Shelter Cove, Beach, South Beach, bike paths - Most people weren't wearing masks (I never wore one in these situations)The vast majority of people (98%) were practicing social distancing. We never at any point down there felt unsafe. Have a great time."
"""but, obviously it’s tough to eat or drink with a mask.""I'm glad you brought that up. It's not an issue if you'd like to wear a mask - you wear the mask into the restaurant, to your table. Once you're seated you are at a safe distance from others. No one has ever suggested or intended to try to eat or drink with your mask on, that's just silly and not possible haha."
"UPDATE: Hilton Head Island Town Council to Consider Ordinance Requiring Face CoveringsView a Video Message from Mayor John McCann at https://youtu.be/BFUAQvZtEIA Hilton Head Island Mayor John McCann has called a special Town Council meeting for 8:30 am Monday, June 29, to consider an ordinance requiring that face masks or face coverings be worn in certain areas on the Island."
"Virtually no one wears a mask. A golfer form the recent PGA Tournament correctly referred to the island as a zoo. Bars and restaurants are overflowing. Most have staff that have tested positive, places are closing down daily."
"Yeah, they'll look at you as if you're a weirdo.. and a synchophant."
Not a fact. Opinion.
Check local websitehttps://covid-19-hiltonhead.hub.arcgis.com/Just returned from HHi And most store and restaurants are not social distancing or wearing masks. Only WiseGuys had a protocol. Beach is jammed packed and no enforcement from lifeguard staff.Walkers and bike riders also don’t have masks on as well.
"As of July 1st, the town of Hilton Head now requires face masks when entering inside a commercial establishment, unless you are eating or drinking. They have a steep penalty in place for violations should they choose to enforce it. This includes grocery stores, hardware stores, retail stores, etc..."
If everyone worldwide simply wore a mask for 2 weeks this thing would be virtually gone in 3.
"I think the key to any vacations right now is to manage your expectations. We were in Hilton head from June 27 to July 4. We had booked a house with a small pool before any COVID issues arose. For the past 20 years we’ve always rented a condo in Shorewood and loved it but now we were traveling with our daughter and her two young children and needed more space. Having private space was very reassuring to me. In addition we did grocery pick up through Fresh Market and Publix and that worked out beautifully. We had dinners out, sitting outside, and going early and making reservations. We went to the beach early in the day because the crowds multiplied as the day went on. We knew we would not try miniature golf or any other activities which were jam packed. And we also saw that once the mask ordinance was passed that there was a big increase in people wearing masks, while beforehand, very few wore masks. It wasn’t our Hilton head vacation of yesteryear, but we never felt at risk and I’m very glad we made the trip."
Have been here for a few days. My family and I wear masks. We have been for months now. Back home it’s mandatory and it works !! My home state (NJ) Is one of the few states that is actually doing better now. Especially since where we came from. I would say that 95% of the people are wearing masks in public places. Of course you have your few selfish people that have no regard for others. I would have canceled my trip had they not mandated masks.
"So, you're quarantining upon your return to NJ?"
"Yes and we all are gonna get tested.Edited: 7:49 am, July 13, 2020 "
"We are in Hilton Head now, Monday, July 13. We have and will continue eating in our villa, and, actually, brought food from home. Since we now live only 4 hours away, this was feasible. The 2 days we have been here, we can say people wearing masks. We did do an outside lunch and everyone had a mask on until they were seated, tables, were at least, 10 feet from each other. The host station was outside, and done came to the stand without a mask, and did not have one, and she was nit given a table."
