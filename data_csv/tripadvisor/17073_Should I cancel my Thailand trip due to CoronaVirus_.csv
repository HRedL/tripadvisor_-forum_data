"We have a trip planned there and we are not going to cancel it. There has not been a travel ban put in place but I did read this advisory this evening:The FCO “advise against all but essential travel to areas within the provinces on the Thailand-Malaysia border, including:- Pattani- Yala- NarathiwatSouthern Songkhla province. This does not include areas north of and including the A43 road between Hat Yai and Sakom, and areas north-west of and including the train line which runs between Hat Yai and Pedang Besar.”So I would just take extra safe measures when going. I know we will! Enjoy your trip."

#12I do not think she had any intention of traveling to the southern provinces she was just quoting the advice posted on the UK govt. site which as has also been pointed out has been there for years as she searched to see if the FO were advising against travel to Thailand Whilst I believe that some Malaysian tourists may have died I am not aware of any westerners being killed or targeted.

@POST 13I have no idea where Stefanie S intended to travel in Thailand but she did not appear to be aware of the Southern Insurgency from reading her PostI decided that Post 10 needed elaborating on so she was more than aware of the situationBombs are not exactly selective when they detonate so its just a matter of luck who is killed and injuredUntil there is a settlement one way or the other there will continue to be the potential for more of the sameI try not to make any distinction between the nationalities of tourists when they are killed or injured by bombsYes I think that reply is more even tempered Ha Ha Ha than the last oneHappy Travels

"So far one (1) person got infected in Thailand (the other 18 cases in Thailand were infected in China and traveled to Thailand). That's 1 of 70,000,000 people living in Thailand. Currently, not even one-in-a-million chance of getting infected in Thailand."
I did the same thing. Changed my path through South Korea instead of Shanghai.....

Easy if you have booked tickets for hotels cancel them with the people you booked them with or just dont turn up.You may or may not get a refund depending on the cancellation policy of the supplier.
"Elvin Peter. Just contact the company you booked your travel with and tell them you want to cancel. Simple!While we’re at it, do you want help to unpack your suitcase?"
"Where in Thailand are you travelling to ? We are heading out to koh samui on Wednesday & from I can tell most of the confirmed cases aren’t on the islands although I think Phuket may have confirmed cases. We couldn’t cancel without losing a lot of money, we were due to spend 3 days in Hong Kong and 7 in Thailand. We have had to spend our own money now re-arranging our trip to just do Thailand. We didn’t want to risk Hong Kong for fear of it getting worse there & the protesting. If you are in a position to cancel and claim your money back & you feel strongly about it you do what’s best for you if you think it will ruin your holiday. Only you know the answer to question in your own mind."

No Ganesh. Post 24 most certainly isn’t dumb. It’s based on fact in an effort to bring a little sanity into what has become a media driven panic.

"I’m going too on Tuesday. You got to watch personal hygiene .. the coronavirus is airborne, but the droplets fall onto surfaces.

"the number of posts on this subject shows the dramatic effect it is having on tourism in Thailand.....many have cancelled and many Chinese ar not permitted to travel.the disease itself is less common and dangerous than flu for example....... how prec=vailent it is going to get is not clear, but WHO and regional authorities are taking it more seriously and more effectively then ever before .....this means a serious pandemic my well be avoided.However asking on this site if one should cancel or not is probably not a good path to take as one really needs the advice of such orgs as the WHO.

"We come to Thailand every year for 2-3 months from the U.S. We are not prone to worrying nor panic, but in doing a lot of digging on the web, we are considering cutting our trip short. The best information I have found is on this Thai Medical website:https:/…370-suspected-cases-globally also read the Thailand has 311 people under observation waiting for test results. If you have never read the book, The Great Influenza by John M. Barry, start there then make an informed decision.https://www.amazon.com/s…So much is unknown at this point and you certainly cannot trust the Chinese government to be forthcoming with the extent of the infections. Thailand is still welcoming Chinese tourists with open arms. The very popular Chiang Mai Flower Festival starts this weekend and might well help spread the disease in the area. I also wonder how many Chinese people are fleeing to Thailand knowing that they might well get better care than in their overwhelmed hospitals. I don't blame them as I would certainly try and do the same if I was caught in an impossible situation."

"I have booked a holiday for May and still plan on going, that is unless the whole world ends up in a totally pandemic state by May. Do people even realise that nearly 600,000 people world-wide die from normal influenza each year? And yet we don't stop travelling or create travel bans for that? I totally understand the severity of this virus, but I will wait to see how it pans out. SARS killed around 700 people in total and as I said - flu kills over 600k a year.I think looking out for your health when you travel anywhere is paramount at ANY time. I always use hand sanitiser whenever I go overseas, no matter the country. To be honest, every single time I travel overseas on a plane - I come back with the flu! Planes are always full of sick people in confined spaces.I am just going to wait and see what happens. If my holiday was booked for Feb, I'd definitely still be going.Edited: 9:29 am, February 03, 2020 "
"Comparisons to SARS or influenza are extremely misleading. We have no idea how severe this situation is. What we do know is there is know is that there is no vaccine for this unlike the flu. What we do know is that this virus has already killed more people than SARS did in China and in a way shorter time. What we do know is even with these drastic measures the virus is continuing to spread. Its being taken way more seriously than the flu yet the numbers increase drastically everyday. Initial studies indicate that this virus is more contagious and more deadly than the flu. So if the virus continues to spread to the numbers that the flu spreads the death count will be far far higher than with the flu. There are also significant concerns that China is messing around with the numbers about how severe this is. In the end this is still developing and there is a lot we just don't know, but what is not appropriate is for people to constantly bring up the flu like that is somehow a valid comparison. Its not given the lack of data we have about this virus.Edited: 9:48 am, February 03, 2020 "
"The only comparison that I notice being made are, that the common, seasonal flu virus every year, is a lot likely to infect and or kill you, than the headlining, new CV virus from China.The ol' favorites A & B, and a couple minor ones, have killed about 10k in the USA already this flu season. No headlines, no drama.""CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 19 million flu illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths from flu.""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/New CV infected 1 in Thailand, and imported at that, and nobody here has died. Even an infected, high risk, 70 ish yr old gal is recovering. Lot of drama for nothing.At present, it seems to be well contained in China.MERS & SARS is an apple / orange comparison."
Keep pushing those flu numbers. They are not relevant because this a developing outbreak with a virus where they have confirmed its mutating. We don't know how this is going to play out yet.
‘Outbreak’ in Thailand ? With 18 imported cases and one infection? Lot’s of scaremongering here. Germany had 7 times more infections. Anybody worried about traveling to Germany?
Point is we don't know the extent of the situation since it's the early stages. Hardly scaremongering just not prudent to make false equivalencies to other viruses when we don't have all the information yet.
"Travelkat, it is true that there are people in India who do not have access to toilets etc but there are different stratas of society and not all Indians are like that. Just blanket statemenrs for a perticular country is incorrect. Its like saying all Irish are drunkerds."
Of course all Indian people are not the same. Not for one second did Infidelal or myself indicate that this was so. Oh and by the way - ‘particular” and “drunkards”.
We are due to go to Laos on 16th March and then onto Koh Samui and have no intention of cancelling at this stage
Stef same boat we are watching the news real close and change planes if any advisories are made but the state department still has thialand at a level 1 we leave March 6th
I leave this Friday and will be in Krabi for 5 days and then Bangkok for 5 Days. I have no intentions on canceling either and i'm not too worried. Just wear a mask and try not to get too close to people. And sanitize!
"Don't go to Saudi Arabia ... 555Seems the flu, is the new MSM headliner for ' doom & gloom ' reporting. Sort of like any big mishap, then every small mishap is reported, such as a plane crash.

We are booked for Phuket in March and also wondering if we should cancel.. Did u decide to still go or did u cancel??
"Hi Ash and welcome to Trip Advisor.You haven’t indicated where you are from, but I can’t help but wonder whether or not there is anyone in your country with this virus. I also am wondering why it is that you are concerned about travelling to Thailand. There is no major epidemic there. In fact there isn’t any major epidemic anywhere. One city in China has a very unusual number of people who have become ill seemingly through contamination. The rest of the world has little further information about that so it’s pointless to speculate."
"Thailand also has one of the best recovery rates for the virus. Don’t cancel, but follow regular hygiene rules and be aware but don’t panic. On the plus side hotels should be cheaper because less Chinese tourists are coming in and they make up a large part of the tourist population."
My trip is on 12 Feb for Phuket and Bangkok I m still confused please help

Hi Navigator and welcome to Trip Advisor.Why are you confused about anything? There is enough information available to everyone so that we all can understand the issues. Now what did you want people who contribute to the forum help you with? Help you decide whether or not to travel? Is that what you want? Now why would strangers do that? This is something that you will have to decide for yourself. Just stop being confused and think things through clearly. It is YOUR responsibility. Nobody else’s.
"Oops Nidhi. Threats in Phuket? Please explain if you are meaning the concern about illness, or whether you mean some sort of danger we are not aware of."
"I'm from South Africa and booked to go to Phuket on 29 March, i'm not cancelling anything unless something changes drastically before then, ill take precautions like washing hands, eating healthy and probably wear a mask in the airports while traveling, i'm going via Singapore. Looking forward to this holiday and have planned lots to do."
Hello. I think you pose a perfectly reasonable question. I am in a similar situation about whether to go to Bangkok/Phuket. If the outbreak is not contained the number one city in the world to be most affected is Bangkok with Phuket number 7. The Thai authorities will take drastic and necessary action I'm sure and I don't necessarily want to be there when that happens. I'm not going until March so a bit of time yet. The British FCO makes no advice on this. Admittedly the risk is small but as I said you pose a good question and deserve better replies than the abuse you received by some.
@travelkatt-My bad! I meant the recent scare about Coronavirus.
@travelkatt88 I am sorry my bad I meant the recent situation with coronavirus.
"Nidhi, read this tread and the other treads open on this subject and then YOU must make a decision.What does your Government advise ?Edited: 7:21 am, February 06, 2020 "
"OK Nidhi. No problem. Anyway, whatever your concern, you need to keep yourself up to date with information about this issue and then make your own decision as to whether or not to proceed with your trip.Edited: 7:48 am, February 06, 2020 "
"I was supposed to fly out to Phuket last week. What I did do beforehand though was to call the hotel (not saying the name as it’s unfair), and speak to staff I know there first. They warned me that even the staff were worried and some were taking their annual leave now deliberately to wait it out. They suggested I come back in March/ April once this has been controlled. I only lost out on the airfare, the hotel changed my dates.If you are going, avoid cheap massage places, and practise hygiene at a minimum. Good luck"
"No dont cancel! Still go you'll be fine... Don't let everyone freak you out. Unless you're old and or have a weakened immune system, go. You'll have a good time. Don't let mass media freak you out into ruining your trip."
"Post 24 is not taking account some of the variables which exists: 1 - China has kept secret the outbreak so the number of infected people/casualties is probably hundred thousands or maybe millions at this time (before Wuhan lockdown, they have warned the population so many of those who could have the possibility to flee to do it, and some where on incubation period and without symptoms which has most probably started to develop after they have reached another area in China - and anyway only tested/confirmed cases are counted in reports). 2 - there is not sure if the virus is airborne or not and if not how long it will take to become airborne, increasing the chances of being catch. 3 - what is the weight of the mild symptomatic or asymptomatic people in the total number of those infected (this number is not know!) and this should take account that China has passed through a SARS epidemic which might have led some immunity to develop in survivors which might have been passed to the new generations (other words, people in Asia might have a better resistance to such viruses than other races - this is not yet known because we don't have data about non Asians illness outcome yet). 4 - it seems that the bug can kill after long period of illness (the Chinese doctor who died was first admitted in hospital on 12th of Jan and passed away on 7th of Feb) , this is why the killing ratio can be much bigger than the current figures (time will show this).In other words, I am not able to provide u with an advice, I am myself in the same situation as u are, as I am scheduled to attend a conference in Bangkok at the end of Feb so I am weighting the risks.The advice I can provide you if you decide to go is to wear a face mask in crowded places and some glasses (with 0 diopters - this will protect most of your eyes from ingesting a virus). Do not touch common surfaces whenever possible and disinfect hands using an alcohol (min 70%) based solution after u have touched those (escalator rails, elevators buttons, public transportation handlers, etc). Use antibacterial wipes to clean your glasses from time to time and MOST IMPORTANT YOUR SMARTPHONE, use a cap and make sure you take it out as soon as u enter your hotel room (yes - if someone sneeze or cough behind you it can spread droplets on your hair and after you go to bed you will just put the germs on pillow, a place where u don't want them to be). Wash hands whenever is possible and after each toilet usage, etc...While all the above might maximize the chances of staying bug free, they will increase the burden of your attention and most probably will make holiday not as pleasant as it should be......Good luck!"
Yes as per current situation over there better to cancel the trip for now and do it in future.Special suggestion for some of my friend:Binod SatpathyAshish SatpathyPapun and manisha
"Hello everyone,i know some news are being exaggerated. i know, unless it has been an epidemic, to travel to Asia except China is safe now.i had a plan for November 2020 to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia and now it is time to buy the tickets but i am afraid that it will be an epidemic. What do you think? Any suggests?"
Pl update if possible once you reach Phuket
"Hi MehmetI can’t answer your question and very much doubt that anyone else could either. Anything could happen between now and November, so your guess is as good as mine."

Came back from China last week and still looking forward to our booked holiday on Samui for next month. Hopefully there will be no travel or flight restriction imposed till then.
but can you get to refund ?? because my airline does not allow :(
"""But the whole issue is a tad over blown...""Unfortunately many people like this fail to grasp the situation.The NEW Coronavirus is not the most deadly virus seen as a percentage of infections...BUT IT IS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS.... more so than many previous ones. Furthermore being New, there is no human immunity or vaccine (as yet).This means that the number of infections is potentially enormous and so the number of deaths.It has already exceeded the number of deaths from SARS.The problems that countries face apart from actual deaths, is a massive disruption to workforce, economy and daily life, so every effort is being made to avoid this. Some countries are better prepared than others.In Thailand ignorance rules, as shown by the recent comments by the health minister.Apart from poor advice he was handing out useless masks touched by his bare hands.Most masks are in fact less than useless and may even help contagion, but many hospitals need to wear them...not to protect themselves but to reduce infection of others..I.e. patients.It's very sad in Thailand to go into a hospital and see virtually no effective precautions against transmission of corona.It is after all institutions like hospitals, schools and any places where people are constantly close together that are the best breeding grounds for the disease."
"Face masks are working both directions and I was wondering if there was any instructions about how to wear it if u want to avoid exposure or if u want not to spread....Face masks are not bullet proof due to the very small size of viruses but they can retain some amount of inhaled particles, making the difference between a recovery and death. In fact, the funny thing is that nobody is protecting the eyes being known that the eyes are the biggest mucosa of our body and there is a way to the nose....."
"Face masks are working both directions This is misleading.a regular surgical mask will not help you steer clear of the virus.Ordinary face masks will not help...they are worn in hospitals to stop liquids from the wearer infecting others and can block direct liquids entering the mouth of the wearer.Furthermore they need to be changed frequently or the moisture in the mask itself will present an infection risk.The N95 standard respirator mask will prevent most micro particles.It needs to be fitted correctly and of course, changed regularly ...good luck in buying either at present.In Asia due to flu, pollution etc the wearing of surgical masks has for years become a socially acceptable habit...practically useless, but it shows others you care.In Japan and Korea they are even a fashion feature. About as efficacious as a pair of high heels.It should be noted that thoroughly washing hands in soap ad water is about the most effective preventative measure.Alcohol and anti bacterial washes are a waste of time.Edited: 6:51 pm, February 09, 2020 "
"""But the whole issue is a tad over blown..."" Yes it is! The forum is taken over by too many trolls scaremongering.Unfortunately many people like this fail to grasp the situation.""Well, Wilcop, if any body wants to put a negative spin on anything on Samui/ Thailand, it's general you at the front of the line. I am sure most people have grasped the situation and are taking in and using some precautions. I see in the UK now, there are infections, is every hospital in the UK having people wearing masks? I doubt it.... are the pot holed roads fixed, that you say are so much better? I don't think so. At least at the Surrat thani airport they are checking people for fever, and probably doing the same at USM. Perhaps on the many ferries too."

"I find it interesting how the virus is contained in Thailand, Cambodia etc when it seems to be spreading fast in Japan and Singapore between locals that have not left the country. Countries heavily relying on tourism are still accepting Chinese tourists and have officialy barely any cases despite the huge amount of Chinese tourists visiting."
That advice has been in place for ages. Don't think it relates to corona virus but to a general concern as to the area's safety.

Stefanie - did you end up going? We have a trip booked in 10 days and am considering my options. Thanks
"Guys, we have cancelled our trip since we have long layover in Singapore( changi). Also would not enjoy vacation if you are constantly worried about catching the virus. Peace of mind was more important plus we have 6 yr old at home so didnt want to take any chances. Will be requesting the hotels for refund or future credit if it works. But I feel much better that we have made a decision. TAKE CARE all you guys who still decide to go:)"
"Hi NidhiGood to hear that you feel better having made your decision. I agree that being indecisive about a large issue is irritating and uncomfortable.Sorry, but I couldn’t help but wonder if you are aware that there are cases of this illness in your country also. That means that there is no guarantee of safety whether you travel or stay at home."
Agreed but there are no confirmed cases in my city yet. Also I think airports are the most risky places for transmission especially in countries where there are so many positive cases. No one can guarantee that you wont catch it but all we can do is try and avoid as much as possible.
11 countries designated high risk and self quarantine and medical reports required.https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/coronavirus/…
This has now changed but the situation is still unclear.https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general…

"Adding to what Mr C is saying, most people in the world do not read French !!Perhaps you should have written your post in Thai.Chok Dee"
"I'm Nicholas from Cardiff South Wales I was in KO Lippe last November the issue is all food and supplies get brought in on boat from Pak Bara jetty, it will take one infected virus person to take it to Ko Lippe, once that happens who will risk going to and from the island if your stuck there if on tourist visa you got 1 month in Thailand, you will pay a daily fine on over stay,no flights are operating or very few and are so expensive, the government of Thailand or flight operations demand a certificate of health showing a negative results from Corona and a insurance of 100,000 pounds don't be stupid stay away from any travel go in a few years"
"Well I guess that's not going to happen, or affect any tourist if it did, as Satun / Ko Lipe is shut down at present. Been that way since the 28th.Do try to keep up."
I think thats todays biggest problem in the united states every one asking for permission. If you feel worried about anything in life slow down and think about it you could slip and fall but to ask for permission for something thats your RIGHT no one but you should make that choice. Enjoy the love and culture of all but never force your fear on others. Life is short enjoy the ride it only happens once.
"Raymond, what does all that have to do with the OP asking whether or not to cancel his trip? That question was asked back in January and is of no consequence now as Thailand is closed to tourists."
