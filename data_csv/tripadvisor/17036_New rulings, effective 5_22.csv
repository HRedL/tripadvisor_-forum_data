"Not sure about the value of opening up guided tours and activities considering the tourists aren't there. But it's good to see some movement forward in other things pertaining to locals.Edited: 12:25 pm, May 22, 2020 "
I thought the same thing napaguy. Now I need to find a place that is already set up so I can go get my haircut!!
Yeah! My friend’s salon will be able to open! Good news!
"This is good news. I hope this makes a significant difference in providing employment, income, normalcy to those living in Kauai."
Great news ! I’m Trying to find info on where we can be tested 3 days prior to our flight on 7/1 so we don’t have to quarantine .
"Those aren't set rules, or guidelines yet Kavak. There also is no indication one way or the other that the visitor quarantine will be over by 7/1. Best indication will be when they start allowing residents to fly inter-island without quarantine. If that goes well then I think they will lift the quarantine."

"Well, I have to hand it to them for opening up :Places of worship• Faith Based Worship in accordance with the CDC Interim Guidance for AdministratorsI do not regularly attend church but I understand that for many people church services are helpful to them during these times and the prayer and sense of togetherness can help people get through the stress of it all. Churches are able to institute the same safety practices that the big box stores are all thriving under. It's interesting that Hawaii's first phase of reopening would include this while many other states are still not. Hats off to them for making a fair decision.Kavak, I do not believe you can simply get a test where you live and present it in Hawaii when you land and you'll avoid the quarantine. There are many things that have been discussed as options for doing away with the quarantine but none of them are in place or have been agreed to yet.Edited: 3:38 pm, May 22, 2020 "
Hoping things will be open for visitors by September???
"Kenna, we have no clue at this point."
"The good thing is at least they are trying BUT until they let ALL tourists back in it won't do anything financially.Yes, locals can move around a bit (as all others states are doing) but without them removing the quarantine and allowing all tourists into the state it's still a long shot.I guess it's a step in the right direction though.Then the BIG question becomes, what are they going to do when the fall virus hits?We all know it will be coming once the schools open up and everybody starts traveling around again."
The threat from the US AG about religious openings may have had something to do with it. Outdoor based tours was genius as the 14 day quarantine effectively negates that.

"Those ""new"" facilities were temporary--not permanent. And yes, we could well have to do the same thing. We are hoping and trying to avoid that.But here's a sobering detail:https:/…Though written as a puff brag piece--think about the numbers. 3600 tests *spread out among all the major islands* in one day. Tourist arrivals can be three times that number on any given day, easily.Whatcha gonna do? Let 'em in anyway? Try to trace them and their contacts while you hustle for more test kits?"

"I know that the hospital ships have been discussed placebets. We can put up temporary facilities, that actually won't be the problem now. What will be the problem is finding enough medical personnel to staff them. Perhaps the Doctors Without Borders organization will do it they did on the east coast!!We're getting on with it, but patience doesn't seem to be a virtue anymore."
"I volunteer my wife as an RN to come work there. I think I can tele-work, and the kids will be fine with changing schools."
I know what you mean placebets. Same here for us and the mainland. I probably won't go back until I see a vaccine and it works!! Total bummer with the whole family there.
"Placebets, why wouldn't you be able to come in October? You could afford to do the 2 weeks *if* the quarantine was still up. Assuming it isn't, I don't understand......you have been pushing, pushing, pushing that Hawaii should reopen to tourists *now* . You keep posting about how few cases we have and that we should open, let people visit. So why wouldn't you in October?"

"Hey Placebets! Just thinking over here. Who is the carrier (out of DFW?) American, Delta, or United? Considering all that's been going on during this Pandemic Quarantine time, maybe even in October you could get a refund or credit (for a year) on flights on that carrier? I can't see 8 hours on a plane for me either and I'm a sexy hunk....and want to stay that way!Hey PB, maybe in the Summer or Fall you could take some road trips about the great Lone Star State too?Much aloha, CaddyEdited: 10:02 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Okay, thanks for the response. I hope you can get refunds or credits if it continues and you decide to cancel."
"Napaguy- yes I do not believe it is that easy either . I know the quarantine is set to expire on 6/30 . We are set to travel 7/1 . I bought these tickets back in January and have yet to cancel as I am awaiting Ige’s new guidelines . If quarantine is still in place , we will not go but from what I read they are trying to mandate travelers testing . Let’s see how this plays out . Either way we will have a very different trip this year."
""" and want the country to get back to full time living for those who are not as much at risk.""Can't disagree with that, placebets. But you know it's not the PC thing to say and is usually met with cries of ""putting the economy above lives"". It's a black/white all or none issue with little room for the more practical middle ground. States with little activity or doing well should be able to make the decision to open up without recrimination. On the flip side states that decide to stay closed, like Hawaii, also have that right to do that. It's their choice and they reap the results, good or bad."

"I think one positive thing that will come out of all of this is every single state will realize they need to have things in place, within their own state, to handle another medical crisis someday. There was a wide disparity out there between states of the same population and density in how well prepared they were for this. Each state's Dept. of Health needs to formulate plans now, for future events like this. The entire country was caught with it's pants down but some were not ready to a much greater degree. If they don't have what they need for another crisis like this then they better start thinking about the next one. The taxpayers of each state deserve to know their money is going towards these things.Edited: 11:35 am, May 23, 2020 "

"Placebets... your #18 post...."" We almost kind of figure there is a good chance we have made our last trip to a place we dearly love and have visited for the last 40 years.Makes us very, very sad.....""Just breaks my heart because I am feeling the same way.

"Placebets said;""Napaguy - I'm not really worried about PC and I saw a report yesterday that in Nashville (I think it was there) more people died of suicide or drug OD or something than died of this.""I call BS unless you can substantiate statements like this. I mean, I am not contesting the fact that suicides unfortunately due happen, but if you are going to state that those deaths outweigh those of Covid, you should back it up with some facts. Otherwise, its just hearsay."

"Every possible other death was more than COVID in Hawaii, It's just easier to lockdown not at risk citizens than do your job and have an adequate health system to deal with pandemics. Some will hail you as the greatest so there you go.The plan for the next one is probably the same thing. SARS kind of disappeared. So here's hoping."
"Placebets, did you remove your post referencing the flu epidemic of the late 1960s?~ Colleen"
"When you guys get it all figured out according to your opinion,let us know. We're counting on you to take action!!"
"Yeah, I get that but there is a big difference between figuring it out, and taking action. The state is doing what's best for our state. I don't see too many people here complaining about it Yes, folks are out of work and places are closing. Both my family on the mainland, friends on Oahu and Maui and friends and neighbors here have lost jobs and/or businesses. Thankfully everyone is healthy. The only thing I see from here is a bunch of tourists who can't be patient enough to let us get through our opening. We are opening just like everywhere else. The only difference is people from out of state and those traveling out of state can't come unless they quarantine. Sorry, at this point I don't care. They'll either quarantine and move on or wait."
"I was going to remark, PB, that I've given a good deal of thought to the 1968-69 pandemic. It's a more appropriate reference point than the so-called Spanish flu, and interesting to consider how very differently the world reacted then, versus now. ~ Colleen"
"""But it is their decision, I'm just a tourist.""Exactly."
"I don't think any Hawaii based TA posters are as actively involved or concerned with other State's doings as our out-of-state members are concerned with what we're doing in Hawaii, which is a testament to the lure of Hawaii to the rest of the world."

Why can't I have what I want and not be arrested or sent back???!!! It's just SOOOOOO UNFAIR. No Aloha spirit anymore, Hawaii is MEAN.Sorry, I couldn't resist :-). Several more people arrested the last few days on Oahu, and some sent back from Maui without a lei and a kiss. We're all getting pretty tired of people from other states telling us what we should do to make ***THEM*** happier. Nothing about how to keep our vulnerable keiki through to kupuna safe and healthy, if possible. Nothing about how not a single state or country handled this perfectly....and that our low numbers show *something* was done a lot better here than many places. Just selfish I WANNA COME TO HAWAII. Cloak it in claims of wanting to see businesses make it or airlines survive all you want, or rental owners to keep making big bucks. But IMO, the selfish truth is is is all about wanting to ""escape"" your own circumstances/location for a dream of Paradise. This doesn't apply to everyone......but it sure applies to an awful lot. And the saddest thing is most of you would hate how things are here in Hawaii now, quarantine or not.SW"
"And by the way........people like these two aren't helping the Wanna Be In Hawaii brigades:https:/…https:/…https:/…https:/… (a homeless woman transplant who came over from BI)https:/…These are all on either Maui or Oahu, just in the last week or so. I don't keep track of Kaua'i or the BI numbers/cases, but I know they have had some as well. And there are many citations and arrests that are not published too.SW the Meanie from Maui :-)"
""" I think we are posting because we are concerned about friends and family we have in the islands, and know that some are really hurting. And it is frustrating that the state is not doing things that could be done, should be done and help them.""If you really want to help your family & friends, don't travel to Hawaii until the state welcomes tourists back, and let the state handle it way they choose to,"
"No one here is going without necessities. Food, clothing, shelter are all available at no cost. Those who are out of work can find jobs. Foodland, Home Depot and Dominoes from the top of my head are all hiring here on Kauai. Everyday something new opens up and everyday folks are going back to work.My family and friends are hurting too but they aren't sitting around complaining about it, they are taking action. Just like folks here in Hawaii. If they aren't that's a shame.Edited: 8:08 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"Thought this happened on Maui, it is an excellent example of what we ALL dreaded happening. We didn't think it would be a cluster *in* a hospital, but we all worried about how/what/if/when one would occur. And occur it did....in a matter of days then weeks. Remember this was very early in the CV-19 'game'---not much known, and no quarantine in effect when it started, either. Think how awful this could have been, and how many more undetected/asymptomatic cases we would have had or could have still, without the quarantine.https:/…Two months ago, I said ""Please don't visit now-we can't afford you"". In many, many ways, that's still true."
"Craig H, it did not sound like BS to me so I checked it out. I do not want to weigh in on the opening/ not opening debate. I checked out the data because most people are surprised at the staggering number of overdose deaths in many areas of this nation. It is beyond tragic and truly mind blowing.Here is what I found:I checked Davidson County overdose deaths which is where Nashville is located. There were 38 in April alone as reported by Channel 5 news citing health department statistics. Same source notes 107 overdose deaths from March 2020 to May 20, 2020 in Davidson County. Current Davidson County Covid deaths 52 according to Metro health health department from the start of the epidemic. I only write this to confirm what was stated looks accurate. Apx. 68,500 people died in the US from overdoses in 2018 according to CNN citing CDC. Apparently, a slight decline in ODs. Progress?"
"A lot of folks are removing there posts from this thread. Not sure what is up with that. #50. The numbers you cite relate to overdoses. Don't see your original post so not sure if you are conflating overdoses with suicides.On average, 132 people in the US die from suicide each day (CDC 2018). Since the first reported COVID death in the US on Feb 28, nearly 99,000 people have died from COVID in the US, an average of 1147 lives lost each day. Devastating. Comparing suicide (or cancer or influenza) deaths to COVID deaths simply distracts from what is staring us in the face mask. The 1968 influenza pandemic has been floated here as a better indicator of our current situation than the 1918 pandemic. Would be interested to see that perspective fleshed out. Here's a fun fact: ""The [1968] pandemic occurred in two waves, and in most places the second wave caused a greater number of deaths than the first wave."" (britannica.com) So the 1918 and 1968 pandemics were not that much different in this regard, and it is challenging to reason out how 2020 COVID will be any different.1918, 1968, 2020....it's almost as though humankind is destined to encounter a raging pandemic every 50 years."
"""The 1968 influenza pandemic has been floated here as a better indicator of our current situation than the 1918 pandemic. Would be interested to see that perspective fleshed out.""I encourage you to delve into that on your own. Makes for interesting reading and consideration.

"""I encourage you to delve into that on your own."" Clearly, I have. Way to duck unsubstantiated assertions. ""No, There were two pandemics in the intervening years."" Nuansce not withstanding, your statement is factually correct. Unclear how two additional pandemics mitigates the point.Edited: 10:56 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"Read post 33 to see what I was addressing. Not making any comparisons. I agree there are no worthy data points to compare. I was only answering post number 33 specifically. It was not to minimize Coronavirus (or even to discuss it at all), but to address the truth of a statement made as to certain data. I left out the suicide numbers because they were not necessary, but those numbers when added to ODs would also support the accuracy of the statement that was challenged. That is not to say ODs or suicides allow for an equivalence argument to Corona. In my opinion they do not, but that is not the point I was making. Off topic really, just responding to #51."
"I don't understand, AlohaPractice. What is it you're implying, or taking issue with? There's a good deal of talking past one another going on, on these forums and elsewhere. ~ Colleen"
"I was trying to make sense out of this thread, but so many posts have been removed. Going back to what I read a couple of days ago. We are staying away not because of the quarantine but because we love the islands. We wouldn't ever take a chance on bringing harm to the people who have shared their aloha over the years.
