"Hi all,When in the US, i tend to buy jeans. Because of health problems I gained weight and now i wear 'belly size' pants (29 or 30)This is a European size i think, i have NO CLUE about clothing sizes.But now, when I go to Walmart, they have Wrangler jeans which I normally wear. Do belly size jeans exist, with Wrangler or other brands?"
There are people of all sizes and shapes in the USA just like in other countries. I don't shop at Walmart but I imagine the Extra large sizes here would work or there are also stores that specialize in extra large size clothing.Depending on where you are visiting in the USA you can use Google to find them.
"For men, jeans are usually sold by waist and length measurements, so like a 32x34 would be 32 inch waist and 34 inch length. For women, sizing isn't straightforward, but larger sizes are called ""plus sizes"". I'm sure Wrangler has sizes ti fit you."
"Are you planning to shop in person, or asking advice for ordering online? Because FWIW, I just try on multiple sizes and styles. I find size numbers are never reliable or consistent, it's better to go by fit."
"Also, I would suggest Target over Walmart."
Given that obesity is at epidemic proportions in the US you should have no problem whatsoever.
"For each size measurement, there are different fits; loose, tight, etc. So you may be looking at loose fit."
"If you are a female, you may need to buy in even sized numbers, like size 8, 10 or 12. And Short, regular/medium or tall length.https:/…size-charts.html"
Thanks all. @angNmatt: I wonder why to choose Target over Walmart?I have seen a lot of Walmarts in the past decades but not so many Targets....
"Why? Target is a much more hip and fashionable place, including in their “plus sizes.” Walmart has a dowdy, down market reputation for clothes. It’s generally seen as a place where people who can’t afford to shop anywhere else go."
"That pretty much sums it up. Although I wouldn’t wear clothes from Target either, we go there to buy things like laundry detergent, soap, windex, etc. I haven’t been inside a Walmart in probably 15 years, I’m not even sure where there is one around here?"
"There are quite a few Walmarts in the East Bay. On the SF Peninsula, the northernmost Walmart is in Mountain View."
"I wear clothes from Target and Costco. Definitely have larger size. 29 and 30 doesn't seem like European sizes. Seem like wait size in inches? Don't bother with Walmart. Messy stores and clothes are not good.Target has clothes for all shapes and sizes. Old Navy as well. Both are fast fashioned minded. I don't buy jeans without stretch anymore. Target, Old Navy and Costco are where all my jeans come from."
"Yes, Target and Old Navy would be good places to look. I can afford to buy clothes in more expensive places, but I have shopped in those stores and found a few things that I liked. I would never buy clothes in Walmart."
"DutchTravelagent, this is the forum for the state of California. I know your question was general, but if you say where you are going to be, people might have more specific recommendations on where to look for clothing."
"I don't recall being in Walmart in Nor Cal, but the Supercenter Walmarts in So Cal are great and the clothing is fine."
"I order things from Walmart when they are cheaper than Amazon (I""m trying to wean off of Amazon, too many bootleg products!). There is no Walmart in LA. There are scores of Target stores. Jeans are sold by waist and leg length in inches. Here is a conversion chart for European to US sizing. https:/…And as stated above, you can find skinny jeans, loose fit, boot cut - lots of styles - and they'll have differing fits. It's not unusual to bring 5 pairs of jeans to a dressing room at a time for the right fit."
The Walmart SuperCenter stores around here in Sillicon Valley are a few steps down from the Target stores. I do go to the Walmart parking lot by my office to get tamales though... I also order stuff from Walmart online for pick up at the Walmart Neighborhood store near home which is basically just grocery store with no clothes like the SuperCenter. Saved $15 on my already really cheap travel carseat.
"#scottca we will be aariving in LA and end in Monterey - San Luis Obispo - Huntington BeachI must add ythat we bought clothes at Walmart before. It looks a bit cheapy indeed but that is what it is - a Wrangler Jeans for $ 16 is very cheap for us Dutchies. But if Target, Cistco and Old Navy have similar deals I am inclined to go and have a look!"
"I suggest hanging out on the internet and watching Walmart videos for why many prefer Target over Walmart.Or, just go to each and you'll see why. There are some Walmarts, I suppose, that are okay, but the ones near me definitely have...problems."
A bit of a ways from Huntington Beach but the Foothill Ranch Super Walmart has some nice clothing and is in a very nice area. You will also pass some nice outlets coming down from northern California in Pismo Beach and Camarillo
