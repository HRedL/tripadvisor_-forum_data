"Just wondering if the Swine Flu epidemic is all over now, it seems to have gone really quiet. It has not been metioned for a time. Is it safe to book flight and travel to Florida."
"It was never an epidemic ... a pandemic, yes, but not an epidemic. You can just as easily catch it in the UK as in the USA."
http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/update.htmBusiness as usual here. I'm driving to a conference in West Palm Beach tomorrow.
"It was never NOT safe to book travel to the US.H1N1 Flu is still going around, but it is not as deadly as they first feared, so the press isn't running in rabid circles any more."
"I'm not dead yet.The flu thing was way, way overblown."
We hope it was way overblown...time will tell!!
"Sharon, the rate of infection has dropped precipitously.The fatality rate is now below 1% -- less than half the mortality rate of the ordinary run-of-the-mill flu that goes round every year."
"Actually the swine flu is still around, but the hyperbole is gone. I think about a dozen people have died in the US from the swine flu. A real and sad tragedy for those involved to be sure, but the news media never seemed too interested in the 30,000 or so each year from the ""regular"" (whatever that is) flu.They've moved on to other stories.JoeTampa"
"Sunshine 1% is not a good statistic if large numbers contact it (over 11,000 confirmed cases to date - 86 deaths). It may all blow over...please lets hope it does, but I think the public needed to be aware of the situation. Anyone who had symptoms after visiting Mexico..instead of wrapping themselves up in bed with a lemsip got treatment and quickly...hence why the number of deaths is relatively low. Knowledge is power!! "
Just read in the paper a family of 3 from the Forth Valley area have suspected swine flu after returning from Florida. Didn't say whereabouts in Florida 
"Sadly a media induced event, just like SARS, Ebola.I do wonder when we get a serious outbreak how will we know? Anyone remember the story of the boy who cried wolf :-/"
The media went completely over the top with it. I just hope no-one actually cancelled their holiday to Orlando because of it.
"The usual flu kills 36 000 people EVERY YEAR in the United States alone --There aren't even 36000 people who've been sick with the swine flu this year.It is, by the way, now reclassified by the World Health Organization as a variation of the Type A H1N1 flu that goes around nearly every year.Move along, folks, nothing more to see here."
"SharonManchesterUK,I agree with you that knowledge is power. However you have to make sure that it is the correct knowledge and not a fabricated media event.As it has been pointed out over and over again, more people die in teh US alone every year from the flu the contracted the Swine Flu WORLDWIDE. It was very much an overblown media reaction. And I for one feel very badly for any area that relies on tourist dollars to survive. The real tragedy of this whole thing is all of the people in resort regions of Mexico and the US who lost business because of the ""epicdemic""."
The family in Scotland are now confirmed cases and the Scottish Government are trying to contact the passengers who were on the flight home with them.
"The one thing to keep in mind is that hygiene helps us combat anything that is contagious - including this H1N1 flu - remember to remind your children to wash their hands thoroughly and use cough and sneeze etiquette (coughing or sneezing into a tissue and if one is not available, into their sleeve). YOu may not be able to control who you come into contact with on vacation but you can certainly control your own actions in preventing illness."
"and it's being proven over and over again that there's a very, very high recover rate for this strain.a 1% mortality rate means that 99% of people who catch it live -- the very young, the very old, and those with immune deficiencies should take extra care, but for normal, healthy adults, this is a pretty minor flu.You shouldn't ever travel if you're feeling unwell -- but the reason they're contacting the co-passengers of the Scottish family is because they are tracking the progress of this strain -- NOT because they're going to slap everyone into quarantine under dire death warnings."
"I must admit that I had second thoughts going to Orlando, with it only being a few miles from Mexico and all that. Notwithstanding the fact that there were more cases in Scotland (100% more in fact), I was still convinced that Orlando was dangerous.Fortunately, I now have acquired the gift of common sense."
"The Scottish family are being treated at home and do not have very severe symptoms. So far Swine 'flu seems to be presenting in a much milder form than anticipated.However, a colleague whose daughter had qualified as a nurse in the last six months and had found it impossible to find a job, says that suddenly lots of new jobs have been created. Her daughter has been told that this is so that there will be lots of nurses available when swine 'flu becomes a problem in late Summer/Autumn..."
"Well, Mrs Chinners has been a nurse for 20 years and knows nothing of that."
"My sister in law is a health visitor. She had a meeting last week and was told that our local football stadium is now equipt for 'when it kicks off'. I called it all hype and was quickly corrected. The media have been told to quieten things down!! (Don't know how the government can do this....thought they'd like a distraction from the current scandels!!!). The thing is, we don't know if it will kick off, but that's just it...we don't know. The worry is not the flu as it stands now...coz as most have said the strain is not any worse then other flu virus', but with the 'killer' flu's from the past, its the second wave that is bad. Hopefully this will never happen!! H1N1 Virus' can mutate and thats when things could get nasty. Not that I'm being selfish or anything, but it better not happen around Sept/Oct...I WANT MY ORLANDO HOLIDAY!!!"
"Obviously, you have chosen to maintain a level of panic well beyond that recommended by the global health authority (WHO) and multiple national health agencies (CDC, NHS, etc.). We've quote numbers and statistics, and you are choosing to ignore it all. (Note I haven't included the press, who are on to the next sparkly thing that has caught their attention.)That's your choice -- you have that option. I can only hope that we've settled the fears of someone who might have been concerned."
"Wrong!!!I'm not in a panic at all...just stating facts! If you read my post again, you'll notice its balanced and I'm certainly not panicing more then the WHO. Its the WHO that raised it to level 5...not me! I called it hype to my sister-in-law and was given the FACTS!! Still do I panic...NO. It probably wont happen, but to bury your head in the sand is idiotic....being forewarned is to be forearmed.Over and out!!"
