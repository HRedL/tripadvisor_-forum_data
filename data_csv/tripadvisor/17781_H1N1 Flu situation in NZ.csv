"Hallo everybody,I'm writing from Italy. My wife and me have planned our holidays in NZ (Auckland, Rotorua, Wellington and Christchurch, in the first half of August 2009) but now we're a little bit scared about H1N1 Flu situation in NZ.From Italy, we hear that NZ is one of the most H1N1 affected countries in the world, nevertheless we don't succeed in understanding how much this is a real thereat or how much there is some ""overstatement"" from newpapers and international press.Is there some kind person from New Zealand that could describe me the ""true situation"" and say me if it would be right or not to cancel our vacation in NZ?Many thanks in advance, is not easy for us to understand what's really going on in NZ due to the fact that we live on the other side of the Earth!"
"Hello - well I can only speak from my own situation and that is no H1N1 here. I know that most of the flu around here this winter is this flu but most cases are very mild and not many people even bother to see if it is H1N1 flu because they get over it so quickly. In my personal experience, I do know of people who have had the flu and I presume it could have been swine flu but it did not get serious. I myself am coming over to Italy next week so am very anxious not to get sick before I go!! I am sure that you will be absolutely fine still coming for your holiday - life here certainly seems to be going along just as normal :)"
"We are in mid winter so flu numbers has increased, however I don't know what proportion has swine flu. I don't know anyone who has the regular flu, let alone swine flu. 10 people in NZ have died from swine flu, but the majority of them had other health issues and were weakened already.The government is encouraging everyone to get a flu shot (which is free). While the shot won't protect against swine flu it will offer protection against the normal flu, therefore helping ease the pressure on the health sector. If travelling, I would take extra care in the airport and on the plane as you are in a small place with lots of people. So wash your hands regularly and dry them thoroughly, don't touch your eyes, nose and mouth.I wouldn't cancel your trip. We have a low population and I think you would be safer here than just about anywhere.Hope this helps :) "
"Thank you very much, I think you're absolutely right: first of all, we're worried about the flight because we'll be ""packed"" with 300 people for 22 hours!Moreover we'll travel from Auckland to Wellington by bus and from Wellinton to Christchurch by ferry / train, therefore in these 2 long travels we'll be ""packed"" again."
"Today Herald NZ (I read it by means of Internet) says infected people will rise up to 70% of NZ citizens, what's your feeling about this statement?Many thanks again!"
"I believe the figure of 70% infected has been estimated as a worse case scenario based on current infection rates. I hate to tell you this but it isn't just 70% of New Zealanders estimated to get swine flu, it is 70% of the world's population.And of that 70%, one person in 10,000 will possibly die. Making the rate of swine flu deaths just slightly higher than regular flu deaths in a 'normal' year.However I am not a medical expert nor a mathematician so I have no expert advice to offer.  "
"Sorry, I really didn't want bother you with this topic, but to come to NZ is a dream for us......... and don't want give up now, ten days before leaving Italy!The globalized information network is getting faster (but, at the same time, crazy) day by day and it's diffcult to understand what is reality and what is panic. Sorry again!"
"No need to apologise, your concerns are perfectly understandable. However this isn't a NZ epidemic, but a global pandemic, so no matter where you go (or stay) the infection is already there.My suggestion is.. go out and enjoy life while you can :)"
