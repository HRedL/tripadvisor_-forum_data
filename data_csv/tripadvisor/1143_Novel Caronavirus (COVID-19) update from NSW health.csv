I feel like the world is about to shut down ... just watching The Drum and the information out there is very concerning.
it feels a bit like that able .....I teach in a largish metro Sydney high school - colleagues and I were discussing corona today and our guess is that the Dept of Education may break for the Easter school holidays a week early and make it 3 weeks rather than the scheduled 2 weeks. In the meantime I keep hoping I'll wake up and be able to resume planning my long service leave 8 week trip to the UK for October
"My other half is a GP and I just wonder every night what's coming in the door.It's only March ... 2020 is a memorable year so far.Edited: 5:50 am, March 12, 2020 "
"thmoore ... we had a UK driving holiday planned for late this year ... not so sure now, half the worlds airlines could be gone by then."
"Social distancing and hygiene are just about the only tools we have until there is a vaccine or effective antivirals. The last 30 sec of this video shows how even a little bit helps. Stay well. I am very worried about my ""even older than me"" Sydney friends.https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg"
"I see that this is Sydney/NSW - do you think the rest of the states will follow? Seems crazy not to, or people can enter in WA but not self isolate and travel by other means to NSW."
I worry about my local friends too. But not much I can do to help distant ones except do my part with social distancing and hygiene to help #bendthecurve. And post stuff like this online.Stay well. https://www.newsweek.com/young-unafraid-coro…
"If I were in Sydney now, and had been going about my life commuting and associating with people, I wouldn't leave. I got out before the cat got out of the bag and had been keeping quiet at home for a while before that, but the virus is out of the bag now so we need to do all we can to slow it down. So far I've mostly been able to keep my distance from other people while driving and walking around. .. and yes, the world is about to shut down.One thing I did notice when we were in the UK and Ireland last year and in transit is that more public facilities are providing not only soap but hand cream. I think that's a really good trend and encourages hand washing. It should be more widespread."
AFAIK the GP has not been cancelled. One of the team's has withdrawn. People need to be very careful about the accuracy of what they post. I'm attending the GP and I think the trams are a bigger risk than the actual event.
"The Victorian Premier is reported in the news today as having said fans will not be allowed to attend the Grand Prix but it’s up to the race organiser if they want to go ahead with the race.Edited: 6:27 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Matt076 ... you clearly tell people to be careful of the accuracy of what they post and then go on to say the trams are a greater danger than the crowds at the event ... just a wild guess but your not a virologist are you?
"OK... so the F1 GP is off.... F1 officials had made their mind up around 2am this morning, all the senior reporters from all the reputable motorsport publications knew this - but the FIA and F1 officials didnt have a meeting with event organisers until 9am this morning... It has now been cancelled, officially announced.Edited: 7:37 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Also,I watched a very interesting podcast JRE # 1439 with Michael Osterholm which essentially summarised (along with much more):* Face masks (like surgical) do next to nothing to stop people getting the virus. They are designed to stop people coughing and spitting on others, not to stop them breathing the air around them.* Hand washing and sanitizing is good practice but for this particular disease is quite ineffective. All research is pointing to it spreading via airways."
"GP here. @Steve, Untrue. Please be aware COVID-19 is capable of living on surfaces for an undeterminate time that might be as long as 9 days. Washing hands will kill them. Soap is better than alcohol, but both do the trick.https:/…advice-for-public"
"I'm not suggesting washing your hands is not good practice or should not be done...When I listened to him talking, he seemed to suggest this particular virus seems to be spreading rapidly even when good hygiene is practiced.... and even though thats the advice being given by WHO etc - even they acknowledge its doing little to stop the spread..."
The extra care with hygiene helps prevent your getting other infections at the same time as Covid-19 which is harder for the body to fight.
"I think able has made the best comment yet:""It's only March ... 2020 is a memorable year so far."""
It's spreading rapidly because it is a coronavirus. Droplet spread. That means if anyone sneezes or coughs it goes everywhere. Will hand washing stop it? Obviously not. But it will slow it down. To suggest that it doesn't help is irresponsible in the current climate.
We are flying tomorrow from Kuala Lumpur. How is the situation now in Sydney and Melbourne?
"Well , it is not normal.The GP has been Cancelled, as of Monday ,the Government has asked that no events that have more than 500 person. So Football, Public Events.There is talk of bring forward School Holidays . The Royal Show has been Cancelled.Good Luck"
"Shops are still open ... restaurants would value the business especially in Chinatown ... as a casual visitor I'm not sure you would notice that much difference, it may be a tad quieter in the city streets."
What is the purpose of your travel? Is it have fun? If so I would skip it. This situation is escalating.
"Yeah, it is for vacation. thanks for the responses guys!"
News tonight from the Australian Govt is that PM has announced that Australians should reconsider any and all overseas travel.
Of course the majority of those deemed to be at risk will not dare to be tested for fear of isolation/ quarantine.My fear factor is the incidence of fibrosis which can occurr from a lung infection.
"Ref post #39I know this is not new news - but Morrison is a moron.Any half-way normal human in a position of influence - and required to lead a country - would be doing their utmost to stay out of harm’s way & be healthy for the task.Of yes ... forgive me ... I almost forgot. This is the character who took off for the US in the midst of the bushfires. Should he be re-named “ ScoMo the Scarce”?Edited: 5:03 am, March 13, 2020 "
Why doesnt Mr Dutton quarantine himself in Christmas Island where he was quick to isolate others
