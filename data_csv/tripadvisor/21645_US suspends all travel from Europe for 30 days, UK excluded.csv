"Yes, we are rescheduling. This situation has gotten way too volatile for our comfort. Can't imagine having less than 48 hours to book new flights home."
"I don't even know what to do. We are supposed to fly in to London on Friday. The problem is that we were going to take the Eurostar to Paris on Wednesday and fly home from Paris. Sure, we can change the flight without change fees, but flight prices have DOUBLED since we booked them. There are five of us going. So, to change from flying home from Paris to flying home from London we would have to pay over $2500.If we cancel our flights and reschedule for later, we are out our AirBnB money and all of the attractions we prepaid for. So, that option also leaves us out $2500.I am so dang annoyed."
"How will that stop people from Europe to enter the US?

We can go to U.K. and get it from other Europeans that travel to U.K. I am confused.Edited: 9:34 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"""Does this mean US citizens currently in Europe cannot return to US for 30 days also?""They have until Friday to come back to the US. And Olivia is already on to something. Continental tourists could make their way to the UK to fly out after Friday, but they're going to pay heavily for it."

"We have just seen it here on the BBC in the last half hour, but wait!

"As always, you have to look at the detail!The President also said “the European Union had failed to take the same precautions as the US”Now, is the President meaning the political entity of the EU, or is he being loose with his facts and assuming that the whole Continent of Europe is the “EU”! It’s not the first time he has been, let’s just say, not entirely “clued up” with geo-politics!If he is referring to the political entity that is the EU, and by deliberately excluding the UK, is he taking a swipe at the EU? Remember, he expressly encouraged Theresa May and Boris Johnson to ditch the EU during Brexit!"

I think it is defined by geographic location and not by EU membership.
"The proclamation actually refers to just the Schengen area. This information is copied from the BBC website.""Today President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation, which suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. These countries, known as the Schengen Area, include:Austria, Belgium,Czech Republic,Denmark,Estonia,Finland,France,Germany,Greece,HungaryIceland,Italy,Latvia,Liechtenstein,Lithuania,Luxembourg,Malta,Netherlands,Norway,PolandPortugal,Slovakia,Slovenia,Spain,Sweden,Switzerland.""Note that one EU member state, the Republic of Ireland, is NOT included in the travel ban. This makes sense, as the Irish Republic is in the Common Travel Area with the UK.Also three countries included in the travel ban are not EU member states, ie. Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.The wording of the ban suggests that it is sufficient to have been in the countries affected to be excluded. So if someone with a French passport flies from Paris to Montreal and then tries to cross the border into the US, the are likely to be excluded. Similarly someone with a German passport could fly from Berlin to London, but then they may be denied boarding at Heathrow or Gatwick.It is not clear what would happen to a UK passport holder who did a day trip from London to Paris on Eurostar a week before travelling to the US. UK passports are not stamped when travelling to and from France. However they are scanned at the airport or railway station, so there is an electronic record of travel. If this is available to the check in staff at the UK airport, then the person concerned could still be denied boarding.Or the US could simply revoke the ESTAs and visas of all citizens of the countries concerned who are due to travel for the period of the ban. You have to provide API (advance passenger information) before travel, so they have all the details they need.Edited: 10:52 pm, March 11, 2020 "

So citizens of Schengen countries who live in the UK will be banned but not UK citizens living in Schengen countries.
>>So citizens of Schengen countries who live in the UK will be banned but not UK citizens living in Schengen countries.<<No.What Trump said and what he should've said are completely different.The ban is for anybody who has been in the Schengen zone in the last 14 days.See Homeland security statement:https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homeland…

"Sorry to hear this. You can always ask for reverse payment with credit card company, but you would need to request refund first before contacting credit card company. Good luck."
"Boy, if only political statements can be made about you know who, but I'll keep my mouth shut!"
"It is hard to see what difference this can possibly make, now that the virus is all around the world. Apart from spreading further panic and pushing stock markets down further.Meanwhile the scale of what is surely now a massive problem within the US largely remains disguised by what will probably come to be seen as one of the most inept public responses of any western government of all time."
"You do something, people complain. You don't do something, people complain. Complain complain complain."
Absurd to exclude the UK (and Ireland) from the ban.Reading the DHS statement it might be better in future to release the text BEFORE the POTUS says anything
And it would be better to take the time to read and understand what is being done before popping off unrelated political blather on an international travel advice forum.
Trump made a total hash of the proclamation leading to several hours of confusion. Doesn't he have people who can write a speech?
"“ Doesn't he have people who can write a speech?”I’m sure he does but he chooses to ignore them and just opens his mouth and spews out anything. He said cargo was banned and then had to tweet that cargo was not banned. It doesn’t give you confidence that he’s managing this well.It’s a mess, the only responsible thing to do is not travel instead of trying to work round the travel bans. I’ve already cancelled 2 trips and am monitoring the situation if further trips need to be cancelled.Edited: 5:20 am, March 12, 2020 "

Trump was just asked about extending travel ban to UK and Ireland....he stated it has been discussed...and then said it's coming. I imagine the travel ban will be extended Monday.
"I trust the possible ban would be reciprocalThe ban on travel to the US from many European countries is to be extended to the UK and Ireland following the rise in coronavirus cases there, President Trump appeared to confirm.He said the measure was ""going to be announced"".Earlier US media reported that the move was imminent.Edited: 12:44 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"""I imagine the travel ban will be extended Monday.""Yes.https:/…world-us-canada-51891662"
Post 99 - quite correct. No travel from the UK to USA from midnight on Monday. American citizens are exempt from the ban.
"<< American citizens are exempt from the ban. >>Although it sounds like you will have to return to a designated airport, so not necessarily the one your ticket is for.Edited: 12:59 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Well, it seems as though a USA to UK/Ireland “travel ban” will be implemented on Monday, Mar 16.I am sure that details will be forthcoming.Hunt"
Today WH said that travelers from United Kingdom and Ireland are banned to enter United States beginning Monday March 16th.
Some US airlines were today refusing to carry American citizens from Heathrow to airports such as Denver and Houston which do not have the testing facilities. They were rebooked via other airports such as Chicago and LAX. Other British airlines (BA and Virgin) were taking people though.A case of misinterpreting the rules?
"Those travelers going to airports without testing kits will probably be sent to one of the few airports that are equipped with the tests.San Diego, Seattle-Tacoma International airport, New York’s Kennedy airport, Chicago’s O’Hare airport, and the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Atlanta airports."
">>> I trust the possible ban would be reciprocal <<<=======Quite.Given the below by the the inestimable and esteemed Dr John Campbell explaining exactly why the US disjointed health care sytem (sic) is likely to be a major World threat, link below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etlyvt9n_QEEdited: 2:32 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"#108 Since everything has been canceled and I am now housebound, out of sheer boredom I am going to settle in here with my toilet paper and blankie and have a bit of entertainment featuring 29 minutes of that sad man in his desolate flat. Thanks for alerting me to this video."
Thank you for that video. It has been very educational for me. Thank you!!
>>> a bit of entertainment featuring 29 minutes of that sad man in his desolate flat. <<<==========The words you are searching for are prudent advice from an esteemed healthcare proffesional about how the the disjointed Yankee healthcare will fail the World.
A. Perhaps there is a political or health care forum that might be more relevant. B. Anybody can set up a phone and shoot themselves and post a YouTube video but that don't make it so. At least put on a white lab coat and heavy black glasses and set a couple beakers on your kitchen counter and get a tight shot that makes you look like you are in a lab.
"We left Heathrow this morning and when we arrived in Atlanta, we couldn’t get off the plane until we signed a form with our current health/personal/travel info. A CDC guy in full suit came on the plane too. As we were exiting CDC was inquiring if we were feeling ok and having any flu like symptoms. We said no and passed through. It was def an experience unlike any other."
We were given an info sheet on coronavirus Which stated we should self quarantine for 14 days when we get back home.
"UK is now included starting tomorrow night, correct?Edited: 12:55 pm, March 15, 2020 "

"I booked a return flight from MAN to IAD via LHR. using a Companion Voucher, AVIOS points plus nearly £1000 in taxes and fees pand seats for 3 of us. I received a Voucher Number with NO VALUE or details from BA. Any ideas what this is and how do I access the detail."
"You should have received your voucher, your points and all taxes...that's what we got back from our flight to Antigua, except £70 admin fee"
"Any help! Our spring break trip to Europe was cancelled due to the coronavirus. The airlines is offering a FULL voucher to be used at a later date. ( SO THANKFUL!). The travel company is offering an extremely small refund about 30%. We had purchased our travel insurance through the company. We would have been in Paris when the initial message was no flights from Europe was being discussed. These are very unusual circumstances. We are losing over $5000 for my husband and I and our adult daughter who paid for her own trip is losing a significant amount of money as well as our son who earned the money for the trip. I was surprised when the airline offered a full voucher! There was no offer of a future trip just pennies on the dollar. We had even paid a pre-paid tip for our tour guide. Of course that is being returned but they claim they had spend all the rest securing hotels, food, etc. Thoughts? Advice? This was to be a trip of a lifetime. Thanks in advance!"
Do you have travel insurance?
There's a club of thousands in this position.
"Yes but it was not cancel for any reason. Matter of fact, that wasn't even an option. My mistake was trusting the insurance they offered. I know better now. The airlines have been fabulous! They claim to have already paid vendors? ??"
Thank you! Just curious is a global pandemic was a situation beyond anyone's control?
The ban on travel from Europe does not include U.S. citizens and green card holders.
"We paid a hefty deposit on a rental home to sstay with our children and grandchildren in the Cotswold's. We paid Character Cottage Holidays Limited. They have acknowledged we cannot travel there, from California to London, but refuse a refund. They are literally keeping our money for no reason at all. I am so sorry I trusted them, and wish I had rented through some other agency. During the pandemic, I own a vacation rental and have refunded everyone. They won't do the right thing and it should be illegal to keep all the funds. BEWARE of Character Cottages, they are not to be trusted. If anyone knows of a watchdog group to file a complaint with, I 'd love to know. From what I've seen online, they have done this repeatedly ti a number of guests."
"According to https:/…booking-conditions that's correct, cancellation, even >56 days in advance means a loss of deposit. Might not be very customer friendly but it's there in the T&C, use your travel insurance?"
"For those who were earlier wondering if there would be a reciprocal ban on US travelers into the UK, a woman was denied entry recently (she was coming to help her pregnant daughter during and after birth), but it appears there is no such official policy.https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr…"
"Yes I saw that this morning and no it isn't essential travel and so I agree with her being sent back.What amused me was that the American lady said that the border force were rude to her. Arriving in the US is not barrel of laughs at their border entry points : pot , kettle,black"
"no problem, bianca89, but merely an observation: We all know that nasty and warm folk are found anywhere, happily with the former as a general exception in most environments.If we go to a market or store within our own country and are treated harshly, we don't tend to identify another by mutual nationality such as ""a fellow USA or UK citizen was nasty to me today"". Yet in international transactions, this pointedly descriptive a focus seems to occur regularly. with whoever is perceived as ""other""."
We have travel planned via British Airways from JFK in mid August. Has anyone heard if things will be back to a semi normal to allow flights as well as tourism?
Nobody has heard anything because nobody is able to make that decision yet. Your guess about what the US government might do is as good as mine ( or anyone else who posts here) about what our government might do. We none of us have any choices beyond ‘wait and see’ I’m afraid.
Nobody Here has any idea about what might be in August.There are still too many unquantifiable factors involved.
There are flights now so I’m pretty sure there will be flights in August. I seriously doubt it’ll be tourism as normal.
"##Has anyone heard if things will be back to a semi normal to allow flights as well as tourism?##How is anyone going to be able to answer that? We are still in lockdown and have no idea what may happen as restrictions are lifted, the virus may resurge and we are back in lockdown or things may go well. I think any government will be very cautious of letting foreign tourists into their country. Our government have said to not plan holidays for this summer. If this is the case then no you will not be having your holiday.This virus is not going away any time soon, we know little about it and don’t know what may happen in the future. Foreign travel is a long way off. Enjoy your own country, boost your own economy and plan foreign trips for 2021/2.Be realistic, foreign travel is a privilege not a right.Keep well and safe."
It is just a case of wait and see as to what will happen in August.
