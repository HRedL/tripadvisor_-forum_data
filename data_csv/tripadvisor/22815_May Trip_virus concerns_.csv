We go to Cyprus every year and this year in May we return however we booked long before the outbreak... I have read some borders are closed we always stay in Nicosia and paphos we are using British airlines and we are coming from America then London then larnaca we always go to kyrenia and the peninsula as well are we going to be able to go all over as usual? Also what is everyone saying about the concerns with flying now afraid they will be canceled of course things change daily. Thank you
"I think you know as much as anyone else on the forum.You said “things change daily” and indeed they do.There is absolutely zero chance of anyone on this forum being able to tell you what things will be like in May.So stay safe, keep an eye on official reporting or foreign office guidelines (I’m not dismissing the forum or any other forum but the reality is that only official sources can respond) and keep washing your hands.The border closures are also connected to the migrant situation in Turkey so not necessarily related to CoronaEdited: 7:20 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"to date , the only border crossing points that have been closed are for foot passengers only , the Major Road crossings have been unaffected"
