Please note the following for British Nationals released by the Foreign Office today in the light of Covid-19https:/…travel-advice-novel-coronavirus...AG
"I am booked to travel to Malahini Kuda Bandos on 21st Sept 2020. We have heard nothing about whether our trip is still on. If it is, will there be any compromises to our holiday whilst there?We're flying from Gatwick, London with Sri Lankan Airways.Any news would be very welcome.Sandra W"
Gatwick with Sri Lankan. Maybe check the booking as Sri Lankan don't use Gatwick.
"I can't see a change. It still says: The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) currently advises British nationals against all but essential international travel. This advice is being kept under constant review. This means if you do go most, if not all, insurance policies will be invalid."
"That’s for now though, today and until it is changed? So for people looking to go September onwards it doesn’t have any bearing...the question, I suppose, is when will they change it? And the answer - nobody knows!"
"I’d be prepared for your trip to be a little different than it would have been. Not least the plane, airport and resort will be cleaner than they have ever been before!There are a few press releases flying around about airline/airport checks etc (I’ll try and find you something later when I’m on a computer rather than my phone, or maybe someone else will provide a link in the meantime). And there will undoubtedly be some differences at the resort. I would not expect my trip to be compromised per se, but that’s a personal view bearing in mind my own priorities I suppose. Restaurants may operate differently, staff may wear masks and gloves, social distancing will be required - not hard in a Maldives holiday, etc."
