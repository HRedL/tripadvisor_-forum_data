"https:/…Breaking news. Clearer sources will be along soon. There are 3 other counties that are on the cusp. Keep in mind that some counties are tighter than the state. So if you're planning a trip to CA (and it's not recommended), you'll need to research county by county. Finally, the governor may toggle back again if the curve doesn't bend down. Sadly, if we hadn't opened a month ago things we wouldn't be starting all over now."
"The 19 counties cover 70% of the state’s population. Orange County is included....implicating Disneyland.San Francisco already has far stricter conditions. San Diego is not among the 19, but we are contemplating our own pausing and roll backs given our surge in cases.Do not come to California. And in-staters need to be mindful and careful, too."

"I don’t have the transcript, but in his address Newsom mentioned decreasing available parking at beaches and that if a county decides to close beaches, the CA State Parks would close their beaches in the county to align with local rules. This is huge for the holiday weekend. This is not the time to travel."

"And if you're within California, in a county that has been restricted, and plan to go to a county that's not, PLEASE help try to keep it that way! Wear masks, don't crowd on sidewalks or anywhere else, and help ensure the place your visiting remains low in cases. If not, you're impacting all the people who live in the places you're visiting as well as setting things up for the entire state to shut down again. Please."
Parking at beaches is closed.
I am surprised that Alameda County is not included. We have the most cases in all Bay Area counties.
Huh? What happened to my post?Speaking of casesLA has 1 out of 140Which health officials expect to be1 out of 100To1 of 70And no one is worried. Those numbers come with some distance and some masks and isolating. Gulp

Well gosh. I could have sworn my post was about LA and Orange County shutting back down and the whys..Anyway Im glad Newsom stood on home plate with a bat in his hand. Finally
Please do not travel to another county or area with closed state beach parking lots. Think of what it would feel like if 100s of cars parked in your neighborhood and bbq all day in your neighborhood park. Then the sun went down and you and your pets listened to fireworks for hours. You wake up the next morning to your trash can overflowing and litter in your front yard. Please think of others. This isn’t the year for a day at the beach on the 4th. People that live near the beach aren’t even going because they know it will be miserable.
"It should be noted that some of the 19 counties are not tourist magnets, and part of the huge increase in cases stems from essential workers infected in places like meat packing or in living conditions with little scope for distancing. But those counties which do attract in place and out of town tourism have part of their surge attributed to poor behavior. Those people need to stop selfish behavior. So do stay away from attractive places whose residents really do not welcome people behaving badly in droves.This July 4 weekend provides an opportunity for good behavior....and bad."
Most of those counties are our agriculture. It's bad enough shutting down non essential business. The last thing we need to worry about Is our farms and food!A smart Mayor in Indiana passed a law that you wear masks inside and outside.
A commentary on how California went from success story to hot spot state: https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/How-Cali…
In that article Newsom sounds like an airhead and he certainly has a disconnect to what is happening in Southern California .Today he's quoted not wanting to be hard in the violaters and a loving manner is the best approach Whatever he's taking I'll have some We're at war with an invisible agent and uh we'll lead by peace and love.
"San Diego has hit records. It will join the other 19 counties on the rollback list in the Friday news conference by Governor Newsom.Edited: 11:00 pm, July 02, 2020 "
Too bad Newsom didn’t put out a statewide psa about supporting your local economy by staying home this holiday weekend or something. Nothing wrong with celebrating at home.
State has launched a major PSA campaign with celebrities about wearing masks.
San Francisco may go on the watch list soon due mostly to an increase in percent positives recently. Hospitalizations are way up too. A lot of that is from San Quentin and Imperial county transfers but even without the increase is worrisome. I’m going out on a limb but I think we’ll go back to Stay at Home order before the end of July.
"I don’t think that limb will be a scary climb Madeline. Unless something drastic changes I don’t see how that scenario can’t be true. Yes I’ve seen the masks PSA , I hope it helps. Even some in Washington are suddenly mask wearers. As for this weekend it might just be my area but we’re in mild panic. I’m exaggerating but we’re extremely nervous about the amount of people heading to the beach. Santa Cruz is Asking people not come this weekend but so far hasn’t closed the beaches. What I know about people is asking doesn’t work. All parking lots are closed for beaches and trails so where are people going to go? Our neighborhoods. Monterey closed their beaches yet ours are open but no parking. It’s not going to be a fun situation for residents or visitors."
"sc, i think a few areas will see an influx of visitors this holiday weekend by leaving beaches open as many other counties are closing their beaches. Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara Counties have now closed their beaches for the holiday weekend but San Luis Obispo County is still keeping its beaches open. Then as you mention Monterey County is closing beaches but not Santa Cruz County."
"The traffic in Pismo is already bad. Just heard sirens, checked my Pulsepoint app and saw there was a collision at a major intersection at Highway 1. Yeah. Gonna be a fun weekend. The only upside: Won't be seeing the 4 wheel drive ambulance speeding down Grand Ave every 2 to 3 hours because the dunes are closed."
"Fresnofacts, yes we’re pretty angry here in Santa Cruz that we didn’t close the beaches when Monterey did. It was already going to bad but now we’ll probably get a big influx of people from Salinas at our south County beaches. To me it’s pretty simple if the State closed the parking the beach should be closed. Just this weekend."
"According to current numbers, the chance of someone in California being hospitalized for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is about 1 in 5900.The chance of someone in California dying last year in California, pre-COVID-19, was 1 in 40,000. The chance of someone in California dying each year given current COVID-19 death rates is now about 1 in 36,400.If you only compare current COVID-19 numbers with previous COVID-19 numbers, which is what the media does because it's scary and attracts attention, you'll lose perspective and over-react. If you compare absolute COVID-19 numbers against the state population, you'll see that anyone's odds of being harmed by the virus are minuscule."
Beaches in Tahoe certainly aren’t closed and it’s a zoo with very few people wearing masks or social distancing.Newsom should have shut down the shoreline county areas of Tahoe. People that have to work with these non-compliant visitors are really angry about it
I’m not worried of dying of Covid. My neighbor COPD is and my mom with emphysema is. I don’t want to get it just like I don’t want to get a cold. But it’s a weird disease. I talk to people who have had it and they are still dealing with it 2 1/2 months later. There is big middle ground between death and no big deal. Can everyone afford to be out of work for 2 1/2 months like my friend? She’s 48. Completely healthy before this.
"""Can everyone afford to be out of work for 2 1/2 months like my friend?""Too many people are out of work whether they have COVID-19 or not."
"""If you compare absolute COVID-19 numbers against the state population, you'll see that anyone's odds of being harmed by the virus are minuscule.""Did you know the virus is still raging? Really, it's in all those ""scary"" news media reports."
^^^ I gave you the numbers. It's up to you whether you want to base your views on those or from media headlines.
"^^^^^ The CURRENT numbers, it's up to you if you think your post had any useful information. I didn't see any. Just another attempt to downplay the pandemic.Edited: 2:51 pm, July 03, 2020 "
"""The CURRENT numbers, it's up to you if you think your post had any useful information. I didn't see any. Just another attempt to downplay the pandemic.""Well, I suppose you can base your view of things on guesses and made-up numbers."
They're called projections. They're a normal process when predicting pandemics and other events.
"When numbers and stats are rising fast with little or no effective mitigation and the populous basically ignoring government requests for proper behavior, then I believe Dr. Fauci when he says we could easily soon see 100k new cases a day in the US. This rise in numbers was easily predictable. CA started to open way before the curve got low enough. Newsom abdicated his responsibility and let counties do what they wanted. Memorial Day was a mess. July 4 will be a dollop on top."
Yep.
"Yep 3 chis close it all this weekend. The same fire worries are in the mountains above Big Sur, it’s mostly National Forest. I’ve been hearing sirens since I woke up. Two water rescues already. You’d think the “Beware of great white “ sign would keep people on the sand."
The LA Mayor said the only place you should go is grocery and work You had my other post removed as if 100/500 cases at the LA food plant isn't serious enough along with all of the farm counties being toggled ?The fire is lit.And there's more.We're under seige.
Oh yeah he said everyone should consider themselves infected with Covid19.This is severe.
"I think he said act like every else is infected. That’s the only way people will act responsibly. If they acted like they had it, well, party on! 1941: everyone went to war to defend the free world. Not merely defending this country but others as well. Many didn’t return. Shortages, rationing of food, gasoline, even soap, Blackout curtains. Four years (and a longer fight for Europeans). 2020: Just sit on your butt on the couch and watch Netflix. Go to the grocery and wear a mask when you do. Don’t be traveling around spreading this nasty virus which knows no boundaries. Amazing we can’t seem to do the smallest things."
This is exactly what I was thinking. Imagine how you would have been ostracized with this type of anti -We're All in This Together spirit. So little is asked of in this case and so little is given by the selfish ones who just want to go to a bar in Orange County.
Garcetti used ASSUME you are infected.And you're assuming Way to Much about me which is incorrectSpin it anyway you want if it helps you to feel better about yourself.
"From various news outlets the quote is:assume you and everyone around you is infectious,"
#18Someone who knows how to govern would do that in the beginning not wait untill the whole state is in flames Then. I think no one can be that dumb. I hate when I go to those thoughts..I'm kind of tired of operation USA crisis mode.
"He is not dumb. He is just a businessman, not a politician who goal'ed to solve society problems. Everything he does needs to fit his commercial interest. He feeds what his supporters want to hear. You can see his long track of ""moves"" from real estate dealings to The Apprentice to Obama birth certificate and so on. He spent more time showing his can lift his single hand to drink water instead of lifting a hand to set policies to slow Covid. He said the virus will go away in the summer. He even said recently he thinks the virus just quietly disappears. No mask no testing needed. Right!"

The World War 2 analogy is a good one. We can also stop making movies about aliens invading earth and all countries working in tandem to defeat them. Clearly we aren’t capable of that if a little piece of cloth over your face gets a young women screaming about the mark of the beast in a Florida community forum. Luckily in the’40s there was no Qanon and MAGA to sit on their hands and spew conspiracies while others did the all the hard work and sacrifice.
"We are heading into The Abyss. We are in the middle of a pandemic. There is no sign of leveling off.With Memorial Day unleash, and the recent ""opening up"", we now get record cases of Coronavirus and ICUs were at 100% capacity in some states.And a firework at Mount Rushmore with POTUS. There are no plans for observing social distancing or mask wearing at the event. Chairs are tightly packed.South Dakota Republican Governor Kristi Noem, said on Fox News earlier this week: “We’ve told folks that have concerns that they can stay home.” https://www.voanews.com/usa/trump-trip-mt-ru…With attitudes like this, we are in for the long haul. You just watch.The typical ""10/90"" rule will apply. 10% of the population will just undo everything 90% of others try so hard to achieve. All you need are some super-spreaders.Happy Fourth of July!"
"+1 HappyFeet #48All CA's hard work in March, April and May has gone poof! LA county hospitals will likely be overwhelmed by mid-month.  I can't understand why the reopening of bars is even on anyone's plan. Serving alcohol with outdoor dining ... no problem. But being in a bar, where there is loud music you have to talk over, no one wearing a mask ... I mean it defies logic. There was a good article in the SF Chronicle this morning. I'd link to it but I'm sure it's behind the paywall. The theme of the article was why deaths lag infections but this quote is worth passing on. ""This is not about your personal liberty or freedom. It's about society. The right to integrity of the body is one of the fundamental civil liberties we have in the United State. Without public health you don't have civil liberty.""--- Lee RileyHead of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at UC Berkeley School of Public Health."
"The original post might have been travel related, most of the posts since then have been Off Topic and political. There are notable offenders.If you don't have a travel related point to make, take it to the Off Topic Chatter Forum and have at it.To keep it travel related.... if I was thinking of visiting CA, it probably would not be in 2020, or maybe not until December at least."
"I disagree. Many people from out of state continue to flock to California for holidays this summer. These sorts of discussions are important in these difficult times. This is not a ""normal"" summer. Different conversations are necessary. Just because you say it Scott, doesn't make it true. I hope people won't exercise the ""Inappropriate"" button."
"There are now 23 counties on Governor Newsom’s list, including San Diego: https:/…July 4 was not great generally speaking."
"His press conference was such a mealy mouthed vacillating piece of political nonsense. He showed excellent leadership early on but threw up his hands when certain (mostly rural) counties thought they were immune went rogue. Now everyone's doing their own thing and all he does is threaten to withhold money from counties that don't enforce masking rules, etc. Yeah, that's gonna work. How about a little leadership?And exactly WHAT is he doing about Southern California? People frolicking at the beach. Dining in. Going to bars. Going to gyms. Tattoo parlors. Spas. Salons. I mean, GET REAL! (None of these things yet open in SF county I might add ... by the county's decision.) With a 7% positive infection rate (and likely worse in SoCal) HOW are schools going to be able to open safely in the fall? I have a friend who is an elementary school teacher in SD county and she is hoping they'll continue distance learning for her own health. He says (I'm paraphrasing), we bent the curve, we'll do it again. You stupid a$$ ... if you had kept openings to essential things the curve would be way, way lower than it is today. CA would be a success story and kids might be able to look forward to in person school in the fall. Look at the state's curve. It goes down but then starts it's massive upward climb shortly after Memorial Day. I shudder to think where we'll be 3-4 weeks from now. AND he should have prohibited out of state tourists from flocking into CA."

"I think we can all agree that one of these three things will happen:1) We stay at about 50,000 new cases per day2) We, as predicted given current trends, go to 100,000 new cases per day in about 14-18 days (this is for CA)3) We change our behavior significantly and we drop down to some number lower than 50,000So far we have been doing #2 (doubling every X number of days - usually well predicted by the IMHE models).Right now, cases in the US at large seem to be doubling at about the same rate as California's (we may be slightly slower).It's July 7, I think, so by July 21-23, the US is either at 100,000 cases a month or people get wise and slow that down. California is predicted to be around 6-8000 cases per day by July 21-23. If *that* happens, boy is autumn going to be gnarly and if you are part of a vulnerable population (or don't have health insurance or want to avoid landing in the hospital with CoVid), that increase should convince you to stay home and as isolated as possible. Until the peak occurs in this first wave, and it finally subsides (with maybe 20-25% of Californians with antibodies afterwards)."

"It turned out that Cassandra was right, but she's still one of the most tiresome characters in classical literature."

"The Maritime Museum of San Diego has re-closed. It informed its membership that it aimed to re-re-open on August 1, subject to approvals.While the Star of India deck and other parts of the museum were open to the air, the Soviet submarine is very cramped, and the holds of the Star of India, for example, are obviously enclosed.As far as I can tell, the neighboring USS Midway remains open."
"""Go ahead. Whatever. I've said my peace.""Nope."
"Sweltering heat in the forecast for San Diego, but bearable on the coast. Suspect that is true along the entire California coast.Let’s see what crowds are at the beach this weekend and the extent that sustains are long, long first wave of the pandemic."
Another major rollback on inside operations across many sectors: https:/…
"This new directive includes inside operations inside zoos, too.The San Francisco Zoo reopens today. The San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park have been re-opened a few weeks now. Suspect that the ban on inside operations affects stores and probably indoor eating at Albert’s at the SD Zoo. The vast majority of zoo eateries are patio seating."
"Should have done this a week or more ago. This brings everyone back to what? Phase 1 or 2A?Basically grocery stores, drug stores and some indoor retail. (Those that have chosen to enter.) Plus outdoor dining. It may be hot in most of the state but overcast and windy in SF. Forecast high of 61 with wind currently at 15MPH. (It's been an unusually windy spring and summer.) Al fresco dining anyone? (I was hoping for an outdoor lunch tomorrow but that might not happen given the weather.)"
"This might presage the death blow to many small establishments. They reopen, maybe taking PPP loans and rehiring staff. Now they re-close, retrench, probably re-furloughing employees.Governor Newsom appeared to understand initially that to re-open, we need to crush the virus. We are far, far away from that."
"If we had stayed locked down and stopped flights and closed borders to keep out people from other states, we would now be where the EU is. We could begin reopening and kids would have a much better chance at stating school in person and full time. Which is a fantasy right now. Pay me now or pay me later. The virus doesn’t care which."
