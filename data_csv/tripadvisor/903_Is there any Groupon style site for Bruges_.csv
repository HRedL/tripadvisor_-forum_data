I'm looking for any site that shows special offers for things to do/ visit in Bruges.
"A ittle shameless question as the industry groans heavily under the covid-19 debacle. I think you are not exactly welcome in Bruges with this mentality.You can always try these https://www.socialdeal.be/ontdek/brugge/Edited: 8:39 am, July 14, 2020 "
"Socialdeal.be has a few good discounts on restaurants. Ronny, I do not agree with your sentiment. We have all been hit in some way or another by Covid and the original poster is completely welcome to go to Bruges. At least they are travelling and paying for hotels/ restaurants etc in the city. They may be asking for discount tips, but so would most travellers."
"Yes, of course, Belgians like everywhere go shopping in discount food chains, and buy clothes and stuff at the cheapest price on Internet. And many Belgians never enter a restaurant. When they go for a day trip to the coast, Brugge or elsewhere, they bring their picnic.Edited: 4:45 am, July 15, 2020 "
"Hi,I think I understand your question. Kinda like the riviera card in Montreux, where if you stay in a local hotel you get discounts on local attractions? Best place to start is the Bruges website, and look in hotel lobbies and train station for attraction discounts. Enjoy, its a fantastic place."
If you are interested in cultural museum there is a museum pass at 28 Euros for 3 consecutive days. It's really good value for money if you think a big museum is 12 Euro per person. For the cultural museum you do need to book a time slot. Some private museums such as French fries and chocolate are not open yet. What were you planning on visiting?
