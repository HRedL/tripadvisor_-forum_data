I’m Canadian trying to get home. I have a ticket to Ho Chi Minh City via Jakarta and Kuala Lampur but Vietnam won’t let me in. Ultimately. I need to get to Tokyo for my flight home. Any suggestions for changing my flights without getting stuck in quarantine? I’ve been in the jungle for the last while and am having trouble sorting this all out!
I really don't know since the regulations seem to be changing almost daily. My advice is to go onto one of the travel sites like Traveloka or Ticket.com and see what is available.
"As I know, Eva Air go to Toronto and Vancouver through Taipei."
"Also, just for your information, Jakarta has a moment ago declared a Covid-19 Emergency and is urging all offices to suspend their operations for 14 days."
Eva Air is also go to Tokyo.
SurfingWild. Where are you seeing this info. I have a flight to Jakarta today and can book a flight to Tokyo today but need to be sure I can get into and out of Jakarta.
