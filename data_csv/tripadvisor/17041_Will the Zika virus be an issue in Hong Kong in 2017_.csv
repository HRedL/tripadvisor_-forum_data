"I am considering a trip to Hong Kong probably this October.But the Zika epidemic scares me... I know the only case in Hong Kong was imported only, but the epidemic is still ongoing. Thailand and Vietnam are close and they both had hundreds of cases of Zika infections.Do you think Zika could be a problem in 2017 in Hong Kong?"

"No one can predict these things, no point worrying about what may or may not happen in life."
"Unlikely that it will be an issue in October 2017, though no guarantees. HK health authorities are usually pretty on the ball about threats and threat mitigation. You can wear mosquito repellent, but IME mosquitoes are not usually much of an issue in HK in October unless you are hiking in some of the vegetated areas outside the built-up urban areas."
Unpredictable indeed.Also wondering why you think a visit to Hong Kong is so much more of a risk than your home country?
I live in Miami and we had zika zones where they were basically quarantining certain areas. Unless you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant zika isn't really a threat. With all the PSA they were putting on TV we all became experts haha.
"I get mosquito bites occasionally, and I never think about Zika virus nor Dengue Fever. I don't think about bird flu either."
