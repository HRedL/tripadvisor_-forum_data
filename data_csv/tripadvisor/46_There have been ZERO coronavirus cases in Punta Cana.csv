Despite many questions asked here about the subject there have been NO cases of the coronavirus in Punta Cana. There have been a couple in other areas of the DR and they did not flying through or stay in Punta Cana. Enjoy your vacation and don't let fear keep you from enjoying life.
"good to know, but your information is unfounded"
"https:/…Santo Domingo.- Despite that several countries have closed their borders and restricted the arrival of people from China, Italy and other nations as a preventive measure against COVID-19, the Dominican Republic still allows the entry of passengers arriving from those countries through several airlines.This is confirmed by a statement from JetBlue airline, in which its customers are informed that all those who have been in China in the last 14 days will only be able to travel to Punta Cana (PUJ) and Santo Domingo (SDQ), and no another destination in the Dominican Republic.So far the Dominican Republic has restricted flights from Italy, however there are passengers who have entered the country, with connections to other terminals such as Spain.JetBlue has told its customers of the measures they have taken against the new coronavirus and of the restrictions that exist in the destinations in their itineraries.I'm thinking NO to vacation ....Edited: 5:40 pm, March 12, 2020 "
So I guess the 7 that have it in Bayahibe didn't breath or cough on anyone? Bayahibe is 43 miles away. Get real.@hdbjones...Thanks for the link. It is what I expected. China has a great deal of investment in the DR.I don't believe the DR will share info re victims in PC.

Cover your eyes Deb. ; )
You are correct. Of course people can't be expected to stop traveling but we are definitely spreading it.
"Exactly Darlene. If I were scheduled to go now, and I went, I feel I would be irresponsible. A county a mile away, that I frequent often, is basically on lockdown. I am not saying anyone else would be, just how I would feel.Glad I don't go in October. I hope its gone by then."
"I’m just stunned with the number of posts and replies from those with the attitude of “screw it, nothing can stop my good time.” We have a responsibility as a society and world community to try to slow the spread of this thing (flatten the curve) and altering the way we live and conduct ourselves will make the difference. Those who are healthy will probably be fine. Those who aren’t-we know it will hit them hard and some won’t survive. The DR is still developing and the healthcare system will not be able to take care of their population. The population of a country that many claim to love will suffer. Our vacations can wait, but for some, this will end in devastation."
I just booked flights to PUJ for Monday if our planned trip to the South of France (scheduled to depart Sunday) gets canceled. I was surprised that airfares were quite reasonable for such a last minute booking. I also found good rates for various Mexico destinations. I keep checking the Canadian government’s travel advisory site for any changes. We’ll see...

"Prices have gone down a bit again this morning (that is other than Dreams Macao which is super expensive although empty...). Still looks like PC is safer than my town. Now that our PM's wife is infected, ready for the whole country to shut down ;o)"
I would not expect the D.R. government to be transparent about any cases here. And they are unequipped to handle this virus at their already over stressed health care system. Cases in PC and Bayahibe quickly turn to cases in SD and beyond.
Airport employees at PUJ are being told not to wear mask and gloves because its going to scare travelers.
"<< “Airport employees at PUJ are being told not to wear mask and gloves...” >>Most airport workers — the world over — have been wearing gloves for YEARS.As for masks, they should be told not to wear them because they don’t do any good unless the wearer is sick... and if that’s the case, that’s a whole different issue.Edited: 9:37 am, March 13, 2020 "
"I'm unclear.. are we supposed to stop our lives until there is a cure? Everyday on the news you hear of someone else getting it and it's getting closer and closer to home. I believe you need to be aware but to also realize that unless you plan on NEVER leaving your home until this virus is over then you have just as good of a chance getting it locally then you do out and about whether that be on vacation, in the grocery store, at the movies or the mall etc. as quoted by Roosevelt.. the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
"Yes. For the next few weeks or so activities will be severely curtailed. This is a crucial time to stop the spread of the virus so that medical facilities will not be overrun with patients, It is not so much that you get sick but you spreading the sickness to many others. I would still travel to PC at this time but am curtailing many activities at home."
There have been 2 cases of tourist in Bayahibe and they were quarantined along with the workers who attended to them. They list 5 cases in total but this includes the quarantined health workers who never had tested positive for it from what I read. As far as China there are no banned flights but the Chinese have been banned from traveling to the DR. In the case of Italy flights were cancelled.https:/…
Travelagentana Yesterday most of us were thinking along the lines of our own safety. Today some of us are starting to question the safety of others and wonder if we are making the best decisions for the greater good. I have no idea what I would do if I had a vacation planned. You quoted that we have nothing to fear but fear itself. I don't think that applies. People can be cautious and make good decisions without being fearful.
"Even if there has been zero cases, that isn't the point anymore. Focus has changed to stop spreading and contain. I'm in Punta Cana now. When we left Canada, the outlook was that Punta Cana was a safe destination. Now, everything is crazy. Everything has changed within a few days.Not sure where my plane will land upon return, must self-quarentine upon return for 14 days - and we will. It is our responsibility as citizens. 14 days without using my car, going shopping, banking, seeing my kids.If you do leave now with the warnings given, you will have to be quarantined 14 days without pay. Who knows what will come next. This doesn't make for a stress-free vacation."
Wud why do you say this information is unfounded? Please explain as a D/E
@BarrieBrian- John Hopkins site for info on amount of cases and recoveries.
#17 was just about the most transparently insensitive post I've ever seen. Looks to me like someone would rather see people risk illness and possibly death than to have her bottom line threatened.
"bwhitney - very well said. We were supposed to fly out March 26-April 4 and just found out if we go, we will have to quarantine ourselves for 14 days upon return. There are 11 cases of coronavirus patients in DR at present. I work in a hospital and I see every day what is happening and it will not get any better soon. Have to think of your safety and safety of others. Why risk it. Not worth it. It's disappointing YES I agree but rather have a vacation that will be worry free. I would rather rebook at a later date when things calm down. https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
Daisy and Louise....well said!
"Daisy obviously if one feels sick they should not travel to Punta Cana. Similarly one should not fear catching the virus in Punta Cana either as they continue to have no cases of the virus. That doesn't mean you shouldn't still use hand sanitizer and wash your hands often and be vigilant, aware and on the look out but right now it is a safer place to go than many areas in the US, Europe and Asia."
No cases of the virus confirmed. In the US they are estimating that it is possible hundreds of thousands have it and don't even know. That is why everything is closing so not to spread around even more. Stay home and help to try to slow down this virus or things may get very bad. Its not about individuals and vacations anymore its about everyone.
"It's not a case of you feeling fine and going to PC where it's safe, it's about travelling with 200+ close friends for hours on the way there, then back. If you can come back that is."
No cases in PC don’t mean squat. What happens if you or some others have it and spread it on the plane. Then all of you spread it through the resort? Not sure if some people’s reasonings are ignorance or just plain stupidity?
"bbgamer no they are not estimating hundreds of thousands have it in the US. You are just fear mongering. Do you have any link supporting that obviously false claim. The number of cases including those that have already recovered is 3,774 which is highly concentrated in certain areas and less in others."
"https:/…""Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine suggested on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that an estimated 100,000 undiagnosed infections could already have happened in his state alone.""We have got a lot of people walking around in Ohio who are positive who've not been tested. Some don't know it. Some may never know it,"" the Republican governor said."""
"Not fear mongering but watch the reports. They just don't know because people are only getting tested who are very sick. I go to PC alot and have alot of friends there but I don't want to basically isolate myself while others are taking vacations and possible spreading around virus. Stay home. People, put some brains in your head and stay home and try to let this virus get under control."
Live news conference from Ontario Premier. More travel restrictions coming for Canada. One thing the Health Minister mentioned: 99% of diagnosed cases are TRAVEL RELATED... should help those still considering travelling.
"Traveling Wildcat....Do you watch the news? Have you heard Dr. Fauchy speak? This disease can be spread when one is asymptomatic. Google the H1N1 coronavirus and see the numbers from 2009. By not traveling, we prevent the spread. Bayahibe is a mere 43 miles from Punta Cana. Educate yourself instead of accusing others of being a fear mongerer. By staying away now, travelers will be chomping at the bit to travel when this calms down."
"Well said, prize.Mark"
"I am well versed on this virus. I also am using common sense and not spreading fear by the way its Dr Fauci. First it is ludicrous to suggest that the US is now the epicenter of the coronavirus and the most infected country in the world. That is fear mongering. The fact is they have 3,732 active cases in the US, They have started to roll out drive through testing in some communities. People obviously should not travel if they do not feel well and should be vigilant and take precautions but this is also not a case where you have to let fear prevent you from living your life. The vast majority of people recover and have mild symptoms, For 10% of cases it is more severe and the real number is probably less because several probably didn't realize their mild case was corona. If you have respiratory disease or are elderly I would suggest traveling at another time as those are higher risk groups.https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"
"Live WHO conference right now. 174,000 cases world wide. 6,700 deaths. Healthy or not, no one should be travelling."
"You also forgot to add of the 174,961 cases 77,658 have recovered and the number of active cases is 90,598 the vast majority of those are in Europe and Asia. Obviously going away to a cabin in the woods and living the life of a hermit may work for some. It is not an option most will consider or need to that is fear and over reaction which has run rampant with this virus."
Wow. Done posting on this. I will stay home to try to protect myself and others.
"Yes the majority will recover but you completely missing the point that NOBODY has had this strain of virus therefore NOBODY is immune and anyone coming in contact will get sick. This is the unknown for this virus as it has zero link to any previous virus or flu bug. Anyhow, wish you well on your next trip."
"I guess the whole need to ""flatten the curve"" hasn't really penetrated the masses yet.This issue is not really one of total cases over time, but how quickly those cases come, where they are, and when they peak.Overall, It might not be so bad if an island/town/country has 1,000 total cases this year, with 100 of them being severe. But it would be really bad if 90% of those cases all occurred NEXT WEEK... and there's only 25 ICU beds available for the 90 people that need one.Flatten The Curve: https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/20…Here's a great overall resource a professor I had at MIT posted yesterday regarding the necessity for -- and benefits of -- the recommended behavioral changes in the face of the corona virus:https:/…Even if you don't buy into the ""hype"" giving the above a read will at least inform you as to why so many people are doing what they are doing.As Dr Fauci said yesterday ""If you feel like you're over-reacting... you're probably doing the right thing."""
"That is untrue it is a new strain of the coronavirus yes but not everyone who comes into contact with it gets infected. Case in point several government leaders who recently came into contact with a infected individual at a donor conference but none are testing positive for it.  It is also not a completely unknown virus either it shares many traits with other coronavirus strains. Most will not have severe symptoms but certain groups like those with respiratory problems need to exercise caution. Social Distancing, washing hands frequently and using hand sanitizer should be practiced. There also are universities and pharmacy companies that do have drugs that have been undergoing testing trials in China some of which have been considered to be effective against COVID19. The FDA is also advancing clinical trials in the US although it is a long process.Good post RJP it is important not to overwhelm the health care system that is correct. My sister is a medical professional at a hospital and while they have plenty of test on hand for the virus now for cases that may come up she has indicated re-order times for new ones if they should need any are long.Edited: 12:38 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Regarding the ""flattening the curve"" issue - more than 10% of the total cases in the USA have occurred today (so far).Mark"
"Glad you are an expert on this. https:/…wuhan-coronavirus""Is everyone at risk for catching COVID-19?Yes. It doesn’t appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus, and there’s no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. However, children appear to be among those least likely to have a bad outcome from contracting the disease.The lack of previous experience with this virus is part of the reason public health officials are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus. When viruses are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be very dangerous."""
I never said that people were naturally immune to it. The virus is a new strain so no one has built up a natural tolerance to it which is true of all new strains of any virus by the way. That doesn't mean if you come into contact with a infected person you automatically also become infected also.In terms of new drugs as a cure for COVID19 Remdesivir has had promising results both in clinical trials in China who made tens of thousand of doses to give to those infected as well as showing promise in Japan in treating those on the Diamond Princess. The drug is still in the early stages of clinical trials in the US though akthough testing is being fast tracked.https:/…

It's now more than 13% of the total cases in the USA so far in just this one day.Mark
"<< ""It's now more than 13% of the total cases in the USA so far in just this one day."" >>Cases in NJ doubled in past 24hrs.https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/new-j…"
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Looks like the cases in DR have risen from 11 to 21
It appears none of these cases with the exception of 1 originated in the DR. Of these 20 were cases of tourist or Dominicans living in other countries. They did also report their first case of person to person spread on the island so they do have 1 case as well others traveled from elsewhere.
"‘Don’t believe the numbers you see’.................He added: “I think we have between 50,000 and half a million cases right now walking around in the United States.”Part of the reason the number of cases might be higher without people realizing it is because of the shortage of coronavirus testing kits from the CDC. Between Jan. 18 and March 12, there were 13,624 tests for COVID-19 conducted in the U.S. Meanwhile, South Korea has conducted over 100,000 tests, and the U.K. has tested nearly 25,000 people.........https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/marty-maka…Edited: 5:51 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"The number and availability of testing doesn't really matter all that much. It's fairly clear that this is being spread by people who are currently - and may possibly remain - asymptomatic. Even if there were 100MM kits available right now... asymptomatic people with no known nexus to an infected individual still won't be tested.Having more kits will improve the numbers... but won't significantly improve the situation in any clinically meaningful way.This is why social distancing is critical. I don't really want to hear next week from some idiot who got infected last Sunday after spending all day at a St Patrick's Day party at some crowded bar that this is the government's fault and the numbers were artificially low because there weren't enough testing kits.Edited: 6:05 pm, March 16, 2020 "

Hi Mike - stay well down there. Wondering if there is a breakdown on where the cases are? More in and around the capital??
http://coronavirusrd.gob.do/You have to scroll down for the provincial map.
"I wonder where Traveling Wildcat is today. On March 16th, he wrote on this thread...32 of 62 ·bbgamer no they are not estimating hundreds of thousands have it in the US. You are just fear mongering. Do you have any link supporting that obviously false claim.

Imagine, if the President of DR didn't close the borders...Edited: 9:05 pm, April 04, 2020 "
"Thanks for the link Mike. So glad, many with a brain cancelled before the borders were closed."
"Good morning to all. I am about to leave the house for the first time in 21 days. The food supply requires that I sacrifice myself. Just an update that I was able to dig out. This is based on yesterday's numbers. Of the 40 cases registered in the province of La Altagracia, ""only 4"" are in the Punta Cana-Veron-Bavaro districts. The death was that of an elderly man of 88 years who after 15 days of enduring the virus, passed away.This is the most important week for many Dominicans...Semana Santa (Holy Week). All churches are closed and services for easter will be provided on TV as well as internet feeds and radio. As many Dominican families gather this time of year, it is going to be a totally different experience for many.Many major cities are now restricting traffic into only those who reside in the city...no one else, aside from supply trucks and vehicles.We may critique the way things get done down here from time to time, but as for tackling this issue, I am proud of the government, all of those involved in the medical field and the support of communities. What impresses me most, is that for a carefree and social society as we are, the vast majority are taking this very seriously and abiding by the guidelines and regulations.Cheers from here,PCMike"
Glad to see that measures in place are being followed Mike. This will go a long way in being able to reopen borders and allow us to get back down there. Now entering our 4th week of home confinement up here with pretty much everything closed other than essential stuff. Measures are starting to take effect as we have seen numbers of cases go down for 3 straight days in the city and a similar trend across the province.
You guys don’t know confinement. We’re on a stay at home order here until June 10! The longest in the US! Another 65 days! I’m used to being on a plane every week and week 4 of Zoom meetings and webinars are making me batty.. that and we would have been in Punta Cana NOW is tough! Oh well. It could be worse. Hope everyone stays safe and healthy!
"Thanks Mike. I hope you didn't forget the toilet paper. It is so good to read the People of DR are taking this seriously. I wish I can say the same for Philadelphians in my section of the city. People in my section of Philadephia are still having house parties and playing pick-up games in our shared town house driveways. It's a big party with lots of Cardi B blaring. Thank God I have a pretty loud system to drown her out with Led Zeppelin(only kidding) Our Mayor and Governor are useless. It's been a bad day, and it will get worse as each nice day hits. Why get a job when our government will pay $600 above their full weekly wage for the next 4 months. Sorry guys. Rant Over.rStay healthy.  Some prisoners have been released."
Agreed 100% Prize. That’s why Virginia really clamped down. Idiot kids in Virginia Beach partying in huge numbers on the beaches!
"So sorry to hear Prize. Take care of yourself, stay home as much as possible. In Quebec they are giving out fines of $1000 + to individuals not practicing social isolation or distancing. Police really are on the look out. Maybe something your mayor could do as well. Stay safe. The beaches are waiting. Mike, excellent news. A community to be proud of."
Good morning...good news today...no new cases over the past 24 hours in La Altagracia or La Romana!!!
That is such great news Mike... I hope you and everyone in DR stay safe.. I am patiently waiting to re-book our trip..
"Mike.....Excellent news!Wawooa...I love VA Beach! Your Governor had to take the measures he did.Daisy...Thanks. No, our mayor doesn't want to be called a Rac..t. He did have basketball rims/nets taken down from the public parks/playgrounds. Sadly, on a good day, we haven't enough police to keep us safe. Thank God for our Second Amendment. Such is life in the Ciy of Brotherly Shove."
Prizefromphilly that is awful that those in your area are putting others in your city at risk. As far as myself I am fine doing the social distancing thing and spending a lot of time at home mostly talking to people by phone though I did go out for the first time in over a week to get some food at the grocery store and patronize a restaurant that is doing take out only wearing gloves and a mask at both.It is sad to see how many cases they have in the Dominican Republic now as well as here in the US. There are not many cases of the virus in Punta Cana even today at 44 for the whole state that includes Punta Cana it remains one of the least impacted areas of the Domican by the virus which I am glad to see.
Great news Mike
"Excellent news, maybe there is hope"
"The real problem is not really here...it is our prime markets of North America and Europe. Until those countries show improvement, it would not matter as the government would restrict flights from those countries."
"Well good for your government Mike. You are doing so well, the last thing you want is carriers to come in and infect your country. Although remains very sad. Health may not be suffering but of course tourism and economy is. But, we all know that health is the most precious thing of all.I'm sure that your efforts will pay off. When this is over, people will feel that it is safe to travel to your country considering your Covid-19 statistics.Stay healthy Mike and thanks for the updates."
No new cases in La Altagracia in 3 days...a good sign!
Yes there is not going to be tourist in the Dominican for at least a couple of months. Flights are banned through the end of April I believe but even then I think most resorts are also remaining closed for the month of May as well so it will be early June at the earliest before any tourist return and that is likely a function of the feeder markets as well as the airlines since most airlines in the US have shut down 80-90% of the routes including domestic routes and several are facing bankruptcy even with the bailouts so its hard to say when flights to the Dominican might be able to come back but early June would be optimistic from the way things look now as it is likely many would still be reluctant to travel even when the economy begins to start ramping back up in the US and likely in Europe as well.
"Mike, Great news! I also agree your government needs to protection from us and should hold their.Daisy...Agree! Health is most important.Traveling Wildcat...I agree. June is overly ambitious. Thanks for your condolences on the state of Philadelphia. I am watching the Task Force Briefing and Philadelphia made the news. We will be the next hot spot. We have 112 active cases in my zip code alone(That is if one trusts the numbers.)Multiply that number by 6(rounding the number), which is the estimated number of people one person can possibly infect. Sunday is Easter. It is a partying day in my neighborhood. I wish you good health in Texas."
Ocean Blue and Sand says they are hoping to reopen May 1st
Who was the source of that information?
All bookings for every resorts in PC have now been taken off the boardhttps://www.tripcentral.ca/vacationgrid/…
The Trip Central Classic Grid - still my go to when shopping for trips :)
"Yes DR9, been using this for a while. Best tool to get a quick snap shot of all the resorts and compare prices quickly by dates. Was happy to see that they finally removed all bookings for May. Stupid to see they were still taking bookings when we knew no one would be allowed to travel. Now let's see how long before they start taking away June bookings."
"Good morning. Another day of no reported cases in La Altagracia, La Romana and El Seibo.Cheers,PCMike"
"The source of my information was the reservation person at the hotel directly. I emailed them this week asking to postpone my reservation that was for May 6th to sometime in September. The person who replied told me we can't change reservation yet, because they plan to reopen Ocean Blue on May 1st. She told me to email back April 30th to see if anything changes"
I see vacation packages on tripcentral from Toronto for end of April.
Yes flights are all 30 April but I'm sure this will come off the board shortly.
"Cindy Ocean Blue is run by a Spanish company H10 and I know from staying at one of their resorts in Mexico a few times their customer service is a call center in Spain they likely are not up to date on what the current situation is in the DR at the resort particularly with it being shut down but I would think it is extremely unlikely they will have the property open in May.PrizefromPhilly thanks and it is getting harder to stay safe here also as we are also talked about sometimes as becoming a hotspot as well but lately we have not been on that list. They have 1,950 cases in Houston but the SE Texas area has about 4900 now so it continues to be a concern but we are not in any immediate danger of overwhelming the the healthcare system here fortunately as many have not required hospitalization and the Texas Medical Center which has 40 hospitals all in about a mile or so of one another as well as other regional hospitals in the metro area so we are more fortunate in that regard, I don't think anyone wants deal with what those poor people in New York or Italy are going through right now. I hope you remain safe as well in the City of Brotherly Love. It is hard to believe how quickly this virus has spread we only had 3,774 cases about 23 days ago on the John Hopkins website and now we have over 100 X as many. Obviously more were likely infected then and didn't know it but its hard to image how a few weeks can change the way things look."
"Traveling Wildcat, I agree. I don't think they will be open by May 1st either. But by telling me this, they are avoiding my question of asking for a refund or to reschedule for Sept. I've sent 3 different emails in two weeks and they tell me to email back April 30th to see what's up. My trip was scheduled for May 6th. I'd just assume reschedule it now. Delta will give me a travel credit, but OBS has avoid my reschedule request."
"Good afternoon...just an update...10 new cases over the past 48 hours, no new deaths."
Thanks for the updates PC Mike !!!
"Good morning...this from the local news...translated for you...Ministry of Public Health records about 23 cases of COVID-19 in Verón-Punta CanaPOSTED BY JULIO GONZÁLEZ ON04/16/2020IN REGIONALSVeron. - The provincial director of Health, Mayra Paula Vargas, reported that in the Verón-Punta Cana District there are about 23 positive cases of coronavirus and that it is kept under strict surveillance.""Until Tuesday we have 23 cases in the tourist area, of which three are admitted to a private health center in that district. The number decreased because they were 28 and five were discharged, ""said Vargas.He said that they are awaiting results of tests carried out on some patients who have the virus, but to discharge them by virtue of which they have shown significant improvements.In this sense, he stressed that in Verón-Punta Cana the cases that have been registered have been related to travel, contacts with foreigners, the Costa Favolosa cruise and the wedding held last month in Cap Cana.""Among the infected people we detected one in the community of Cabeza de Toro, but it is already in the recovery phase,"" said the provincial director of Public Health.He emphasized that despite the fact that in the area, until last Tuesday there were about 23 cases, there is still no community transmission in the tourist area, as if it happens in Higuey.He reiterated his call to the population to comply with the established measures, among them: avoid crowds, wear mouth covers, gloves and stay at home if there is no strict need to leave.In addition, he recalled that people who have medical insurance can take the COVID-19 test at the Reference and Amadita laboratories, without having to pay a difference (copayment). ""We continue with all the measures applied and announced by the Ministry of Public Health, so it is necessary that the entire population complies with them. They are: maintain social distance, constantly wash your hands with soap and water; use the masks when they leave their homes and have distances of at least two meters from the others when queuing to enter a commercial establishment, ""said Vargas."
"Thank you for the update...much appreciated....side note - it's snowing in Ontario, Canada today....really hoping to get back to PC under safe and healthy conditions for all..."
Reggie...could not be a more perfect day here locally!
"Mike. I presume, maybe incorrectly, that the population in Punta Cana is well down now that most tourists have left & some hotel staff who have been laid off have returned to their home areas. Do you think this makes it easier for the authorities to monitor cases & explains the low numbers of cases that are being reported?"
"Gran...we have a steady population of approx 40,000 in the region of Cap Cana, Punta Cana, Veron and Bavaro. This increases obviously at times of the year.Based on 28 reported cases in the district, that works out to .0007%. In other words, not a major factor in the area."
PuntaCanaMike Thank you for your reply. It seems that the DR could be dealing with this quite well compared with the UK & the US where it seems to have been dealt with extremely badly.
"According to worldmeters.com, our death rate per million is well below the UK, Canada, and the US...and yes...we get updated daily.Dom Rep @ 20 per million Canada @ 39 per millionUSA @ 118 per millionUK @ 228 per millionWe actually loose on average 250 people a month to traffic accidents or 300 per million. Some had joked in the news that for the first time many can remember, nobody died in traffic accidents over Holy Week! I think the last time that happened was before the first car of moto arrived on the island."
"28 out of 40,000 is .07%"
"28 out of 40,000 is .07% ??? I think your calculator is infected with a virus"
"No, I think you don't comprehend basic math. 28 out of 40,000 = .0007.0007 = .07%"
Just the same...a very low rate.

Hmmmm....
the DR are getting 1400 cases per day... they haven't reached peak yet and cases are increasing. See here https:/…Not sure teh UK will open up the borders to allow flying to here any time soon.. which is gutting as we are supposed to be going to DR in 8 weeks :(J
In the DR yes but not in the Punta Cana area. The La Altagracia Province which contains all of Punta Cana and then some had 423 total cases of which 218 have recovered and there have only been 2 deaths. There are only 203 active cases in this region and they have not been rising so far for several weeks no new cases.
"unfortunately, the UK government doesn't look at that.. just the Overall Country,, J"
"Wildcat, I don't know where you get your numbers, but they are totally wrong. As of yesterday our reported cases in La Altagracia province are 1238 cases, with 553 recovered and 2 deaths. We have had a substantial rise in cases, contrary to what you have posted.Cheers,PCMike"
"DR numbers dropped from 1400+ to 974 in last 24 hours. But numbers have been fluctuating up and down significantly in the past month so tough to make much sense out of them, especially not knowing what the testing numbers are."
Sly according to this just over 22000 tests in the last weekhttps:/…
"Mike.. those are the numbers I’m seeing as well. It’s jumping up big time and as more places open, it’s going to get worse. You’re in a tough spot because I know you need tourists for your business but don’t need the tourists spreading Covid or the other folks from outside of La Altagracia bringing it in to the area. This sucks!"
"Again, numbers down 500 in last 24 hrs. Read what you want in the numbers game but 500 down is positive."
"Sly.. their numbers look like a roller coaster. They may be up 1000 tomorrow. Need to watch the trend and the curve instead of 1 day. Too many variables go into 1 day. I hope they continue to trend down. We’ll really see what it looks like in a few weeks when more tourists visit the area. My state, Virginia was down, now we’re trending back up unfortunately and our Gov is talking about possible moves back from phase 3 to phase 2."
"Absolutely agree so why be so negative when it goes down 500 (not you specifically). I have been saying this for 2 weeks now. Some here are trying to predict that things will be even worse. My point is that numbers are managed . We see it here in Canada. And we don't want to mention the US. Let the DR deal with their local numbers. Stop trying to equate numbers to the tourism. If it worked that way, why would Disney in Florida be reopening ."
"One day is not a trend, Sly. It's a blip. Look at the trend over the last month or so.Mark"
"""why would Disney in Florida be reopening ""Because they're being incredibly irresponsible, particularly given the fact that Florida is possibly the worst state for current coronavirus growth.Mark"
"Sly... I am optimistically...realistic. We have a long way to go and no...things are not getting better at this point and time. As mentioned, one day, even one week does not make a trend. You can paint rainbows if you like, but with rainbows, there are storm clouds...plenty of them. Trust the boots on the ground."
"I'm pretty sure that's what I've been saying Mark. You predicted a massive spike when it actually went down a bit. Then back up. Then down. Have a look. My point is some of you are trying to make this look so negative it's a bit funny. Not even boots on the ground know what is happening. Here's the last weeks numbers. Do you think anyone knows really?For last Sunday the new cases were 1,241 and eight deaths; on Monday there were 703 confirmed and 10 deaths; on Tuesday 302 positives and 17 deaths; on Wednesday 1,158 new cases and eight deaths; on Thursday 1,202 new cases and 13 deaths; on Friday 1,125 new infected and 22 deaths. The bulletin published on Saturday, July 11 indicates that 1,199 people with the virus and 16 deaths were added, and that of Sunday reported 1,418 infections and 17 deaths. Blips go both ways."
"OK Sly....lololThis is far from being under control.Edited: 7:51 pm, July 13, 2020 "
Mike I really couldn't care less about rainbows. I have zero vested interest. I feel bad that you think you situation is that bad and that PC and the country is in such a predicament. Hope you survive this and hang around.
"Sly“Stop trying to equate numbers to the tourism. If it worked that way, why would Disney in Florida be reopening”Floridians are now trying to get their Governor removed from office. Florida is the worst state in the world now per capita of rising Covid cases. Please don’t look to Florida with their irresponsible, idiot governor as a case for why things are opening. Florida is about to look like a scene out of “The walking dead” or “return of the Living Dead”. I’m not trying to paint a negative picture but listen to the science... If Mike is speaking from experience as he is living it daily, then I believe him."
"All good. Sometimes too close to the forest, can't see the tree or something like that... lol. Call it a night guys. Let's keep it positive."
"Sly...come on and come back to earth. I have 6 friends who due to all of this and the very uncertain future have returned to their home countries, selling off whatever they had at giveaway prices, to round up the money to do so. I have 2 friends who are liquidating all that they have built up over 2 decades with their companies. Would they be doing that if recovery was ""right around the corner""?Your comment about the forest is in fact quite insulting. Consider yourself lucky that your government job is secure, while we who you claim cannot see the trees are in a serious situation., as is the case with many around the world. You can read all the Dominican online news that you wish, but time for you to step down from your soapbox...if you are not here living it, you really do not understand the reality.I read Canadian news daily, but I would never bring myself to commenting on what is really going on in my home country, simply because it is one thing to read about something and another to experience something.Cheers.PCMike"
"Mike I have never said things are rosy. Hence why I have said many times that I am waiting to see how things develop before returning. You have made your opinion quite clear and some may believe that it is the only valid one. I too have friends that have roots in the DR and know first hand what is ""really"" happening down there. They are feeling the brunt if things also but are not painting the same gloomy picture as you are. As for me and my ""government job"" after 32 years in the Army, I've been going to the DR since 1985 so I would say I do have a good perspective of what a regular tourist is looking for with a real interest in this particular region. Again, I wish you well and do hope you get out on the right side of things."
"slyguy23 - >>>>>>>>> I too have friends that have roots in the DR and know first hand what is ""really"" happening down there. So, what is really happening down there? I'm scheduled to go, can you give me all the first hand facts? Thanks"
Mike I was getting my numbers from Google. By typing in La Altagracia covid cases. It is good to know that is not the actual number in terms of cases and active cases the deaths remained the same. In terms of the travel and tourism being very bad I don't things are bad and they will likely get worse if tourism never comes back there. There obviously are people's jobs down there who are impacted by this. While it is our vacation there jobs depend on it and not just resort employees also food suppliers ancillary trips that those tourist take and many others in the supply chain.. The this is a start of a slow recovery and Sadly Viki it won't be back this year next year is hard to tell at this point but it might start to return then. The one thing that is known is that many people are looking to get back out and do things like travel this of course has compounded the problem where I live as people have gone out to bars and restaurants again and particularly younger people have too often ignored protocols when doing so.At the end of the day mask and face shields prevent the spread of the virus and too many people not using them prolongs the virus and puts many jobs at risk as some area's including my own are rolling back some of the businesses that had opened.
"one fact that seems to be overlooked is WINTER!!!you can say what you want that there is/was a good tourist base in the summer, however when the weather starts to get shatty more and more people will look at sun destinations, even with restrictive protocols in placewill it be like the glory years, of course not, will it be better then what it is now, YUPwill some companies not make, YUP againbut is the lid closing on the coffin of the tourist industry in the DR and elsewhere . HEL noas for one decrying another to get of their soapbox.. let them be the first to step of theirs"
"slyguy23 - >>>>>>>>> I too have friends that have roots in the DR and know first hand what is ""really"" happening down there.So, what is really happening down there? I'm scheduled to go, can you give me all the first hand facts?Thanks"
"Mandy Cosmo is currently in the Dominican at the Barcelo Palace and was having a great time. He did say only 3 of the ala carte's were open though they rotate which 3 plus the sports bar which was also serving food The property which only has 2 of their resorts open so restaurants associated with the closed resorts are unavailable only those at the Barcelo Palace were available. He said they were required to wear mask in the lobby area but not at pools or the beach.. He did mention that only about 200 people were at the resort currently.Edited: 1:46 pm, July 14, 2020 "
"traveling_wildcat123 - thanks so much. That's good info. I am seriously interested (and I'm sure others are as well) what first hand knowledge about what is REALLY happening down there that slyguy23's friends that he knows in the DR have. This is a great opportunity to hear first hand what all the articles and papers might or might not know. I've see slyguy on the forum today, but I think he missed my question. No problem, I'll keep posting it till he sees it. Thanks for the info on Cosmos experience. I read he is having a great time! Hope you and your state are doing okay. It's crazy in Texas right now. Stay safe!"
"Hey MandyMa. So you are back. I think we should we add the letters AAARRDEEEEEE on the end of MA on your name on here? Almost 14 days out of the PM Forum, have you been self isolating from us? Can you do another 14 please? Longer? Just kidding, but....................Why all of a sudden do you feel the urge to come out with this......... ""I've see slyguy on the forum today, but I think he missed my question. No problem, I'll keep posting it till he sees it. "" And don't come back with the ""I can because I can B***""Sly has 14K posts on here, and I think over the years he has given more info/help than you or I ever will.So give the guy a break will you.Waiting on your 40th post, cus I know it's coming. Hope for a change you come back with a ""You know what you are right......................"""
"IMO, the speculation and predictions based on things found on the internet, online newspapers most of us read, i.e. Dominican Today and Diario Libre, are seriously annoying. I will take my advice re ""what's really going on down there"" from boots on the ground that actually live there and post here. Not speculation. None of can say what's going to happen next week.Let's face it, most of us that are frequent travellers, and have outgoing personalities have ""friends"" with whom we correspond. I know what's going down from the point of view of staff/former staff. My heart breaks and we did/do what we can.I will take my travel advice from someone who has dedicated his time since 2005 or 2006 on this board. His track record is a matter of record based on how long he has posted. Anyone can say they have been to a destination any number of times. He has lived it. We have had our differences,but he has earned my respect. If he tells me October isn't a good time, we will cancel. Thank you Mike for giving boots on the ground info from your adopted home. You are a survivor. You will get through this. Thanks too to those who are giving us up to date, just returned and Live From threads in real time."
The problem doesn't lie with Dominicans but with tourists from highly infected areas like the US and the UK (mostly England) and a few other EU countries.
"First, let me preface by saying that I am waiting with bated breath to arrive on this island in January and pray that I can do so safely.  I agree with prizefromphilly. You MUST trust a resident. They have no vested interest but to bring truth and reality to the current situation.  And quite frankly, I've asked repeatedly from slyguy to provide the info that he has from his friends/family that live in the area ..... only to be met with crickets. It would be important to know what others who live there are saying. I renew my respectful request for that info from slyguy.However, more importantly is what Saleman has written >>>>> The problem doesn't lie with Dominicans but with tourists from highly infected areas like the US and the UK (mostly England) and a few other EU countries.You can do all the case counts you want with all the analytical formulas you can come up with and the FACTS are as follows. If Punta Cana had ZERO cases and hasn't had one in 6 months (this is an example folks), it matters not. What matters is the flock of tourists from all over the world who can include one infected person and then ..... its game on. So, we can talk all that talk about case load and nonsense, but the facts are pretty clear - 1 + 1 is always going to equal 2. You can spin it and justify it anyway you would like, but it will always come out the same. For me, I believe that an all inclusive is a perfect breeding ground for all things. Stay safe!"
"Mandy, it truly seems that your request for information about my friend's family who do live in the DR seems a bit disingenuous. Your previous posts certainly have a tone to them hence you hearing crickets. I have no interest in providing you personal information about their situation and my comment in discussions with PCMike was simply that some of us do know folks that are also ""on the ground"". Why would their feedback be less important or legitimate, simply because it is relayed by me? Fine, simply move along or stick to the ""boots on the ground"" you trust and believe. I have no issues with this. Again, the fact that I do get information on a regular basis about certain things that I am willing to share with those that have a serious interest in travelling to PC has been very beneficial over the years to both myself and some closer TA members who do ask. All that to say is that PCMike is always willing to share his personal views on things and that most are very happy to refer to it so I'm sure you will be happy to contact Mike to get your information. As for my own personal connections, all I can say is that even ""boots on the ground"" can have a different perspective on things. Some are very close to the tourism industry and maybe more affected by the financial impact on tourism and some more by the COVID impact on life in the DR in general. My friends are not in the tourism industry and are simply residents going through the hardships of living in the DR through this pandemic. So their views are not affected or influenced by what is happening with tourism. Hope you have a fantastic trip in January and I'm sure many who visit before you will be able to provide you with excellent information as they travel to the area."
SlyGuy23 - wow .....
