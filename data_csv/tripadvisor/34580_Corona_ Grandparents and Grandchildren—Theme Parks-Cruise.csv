"Andy (Granddad, 67, overweight) and Robin (Grandma, 64, Type II diabetic) are thinking of taking Lily and Wayne (grandchildren, ages 14 and 10), all from Cleveland, for 8 days--7 nights on a combined trip of a cruise from Port Canaveral and then theme parks later this year. In light of the Corona virus situation: 1. Are there any guidelines you know that could help them with a decision of whether, when or how to go?2. Are there questions you have for them?3. What is your advice to them on their plans?Thank you very much."
"Here are some guidelines that may be helpful to the family: 1. On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, offered guidance for people--particularly those (i) of age 70 and above; (ii) with “underlying health conditions”. [Among “underlying health conditions” are high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, obesity, diabetes and other conditions that may impair the immune system.]A. Dr. Fauci recommended such persons “think twice” about air travel, long trips and presence in any large crowd. B. He firmly urged people age 70 and above with underlying health condition to stay off cruise ships.https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-pr…2. More broadly, a recent State Department guidance on cruise ships applies to [all] ""US citizens"":A. ""Passengers on Cruise Ships. US citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship.""https:/…cruise-ship-passengers.html3. Still more broadly, the age of increased vulnerability has been identified as 60 and above (not 70). In a press briefing yesterday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the Director of the CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, noted: ""Starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease.”https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645…Edited: 3:43 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Please don't go. You will die.
"To be clear, I'm referring to granddad and grandma.Your grandchildren love you more than they love one trip to Florida. Note that even if you go and enjoy the trip, the likelihood of contracting the disease, and perishing from it will be quite the negative memory for your grandkids."
"I think at this point in time and given the information you posted, the prudent thing would be to postpone scheduling the trip. Not only do the grandparents fall into the higher risk category of contracting the virus, but several positive cases were just diagnosed outside of Cleveland. I’m not saying it is those particular people you’re posting about, but in order to prevent further spread, they should stay put for now both to protect themselves and those around them. Common sense and responsibility to one’s family and community should be the rule of the day right now. Heed the good advice given in the first response on this thread. God bless."
You are over 60 and are not in good health.So general advice as of now is dont cruise. But speak to your doctor (and your travel insurance) to make sure i would be cruising the caribbean at least if i had already booked. But i am not you.
The OP has a Coronavirus obsession.
"To add to the guidelines in Post 1:Dr. Fauci spoke this afternoon at a White House Press Briefing: “As a nation, we can’t be doing the kinds of things we could do a few months ago. *** You have to start taking seriously what you can do now for if and when the infections will come — and they will come.”https://www.axios.com/anthony-fauci-coronavi…Dr. Fauci also recommended, and requested, that each of us consult this recent website:https:/…index.htmlThe point is: the dilemma of the grandparents in the thread-- and of each of us choosing amidst principle and convenience and custom--is now very, very real. Perhaps Dr. Fauci is also saying: Know the risks, apply them...but now, resolve doubts in favor of avoiding and minimizing those risks...at least until we have more experience...and have a better idea what they are.. with, or without, a vaccine next year. On our Forum, we have the good fortune to have an international platform to share scientific fact, personal experience and opinion...to seek the highest, and achieve it, in a spirit of private diplomacy.Edited: 9:01 pm, March 10, 2020 "
I'm confused. Is the OP answering their own questions?
Cruise ships are floating Petri dishes to begin with. There isn’t enough money in the world for me to risk my or my children’s health on a cruise right now.
"BrlDsguise commented that “OP has a Coronavirus obsession”, and JaimeLobo asked if “the OP is answering their own question.”The hope was that the situation described by Dr. Fauci and the CDC website--and the 75 million annual visitors to Orlando, $75 billion annual Central Florida theme park industry, $186 million lost thus far in 5 cancelled convention bookings, and the personal-choice dilemmas illustrated in the Question and Post 1—would be information taken seriously by those concerned in advance of a more complete expression of the virus projected to develop in the US by the end of this month."
"I think after having the other self promotion posts removed and the OP having to answer himself/herself, Dr. Fauci needs an enema. LOL"
