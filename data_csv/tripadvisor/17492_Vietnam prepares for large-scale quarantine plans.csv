Thanks for the update. Hopefully there's a clear annoucnement overnight so that those of us travelling soon have some certainty. Hopefullly everyone else ok...
"Yes couldn't agree more, surely the FCO should now advise to none but essential travel, we watch and wait.Thanks forall the updates manatdollar much appreciated"
"I wonder what concentrated quarantine could be, maybe lots of tourists in one room for a fortnight"
I would hate to find out. It maybe large tents like temporary hospitals or 1 star hotels.There are plenty of unused resorts in Vietnam.
"This bit of the article seems to imply that anyone arriving from a country with a significant amount of cases will be put into quarantine?:Under the PM's directive issued Wednesday, everyone traveling from or transiting through areas with the Covid-19 epidemic must be placed under concentrated quarantine upon entering Vietnam. They would subsequently be screened for appropriate anti-epidemic measures to avoid cross infection.If this is the case then hopefully Vietnam will quickly confirm which countries are on the quarantine list, to provide certainty to those of us due to travel there"
"I think it's more preparing at this stage:I believe this is as close to the original source as I have seen:(Online Newspaper Of The Government Of The Socialist Republic Of Viet Nam)baochinhphu.vn/Tin-noi-bat/…389655.vgp> Thủ tướng yêu cầu thực hiện nghiêm việc cách ly và chuẩn bị sẵn sàng phương án cách ly trên diện rộng. Thực hiện các biện pháp cách ly phù hợp đối với tất cả các trường hợp nhập cảnh đến từ, đi qua vùng có dịch tại các cơ sở cách ly; thực hiện sàng lọc và áp dụng các biện pháp phòng, chống dịch phù hợp đối với từng loại trường hợp tại các khu cách ly tập trung, không để lây chéo. Bộ Y tế chủ trì, phối hợp với Bộ Ngoại giao kịp thời công bố danh sách quốc gia, vùng lãnh thổ có dịch để áp dụng biện pháp cách ly tập trung đối với người nhập cảnh Việt Nam từ vùng dịch.> The Prime Minister asked to strictly implement the isolation and get ready for the large-scale isolation plan. Implement appropriate isolation measures for all cases of entry from, passing through epidemic areas at, isolation establishments; screening and applying appropriate epidemic prevention and control measures for each type of cases in concentrated isolation areas, preventing cross-contamination. The Ministry of Health shall assume the prime responsibility and coordinate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in promptly announcing the list of countries and territories where epidemics are affected in order to apply concentrated isolation measures to people who enter Vietnam from epidemic regions.So, ""get ready"" ""promptly announcing"" ""in order to apply"" make it sound just like forward planning and preparation to me.There's also talk ""minimize flights between Vietnam to the epidemic areas and vice versa"", so I'd expect flights from high risk areas like the UK if we continue as we are to be stopped completely rather than plane loads of Brits being quarantined. Might be a bit of inconvenience if the Ministry of Health suddenly announces we're an ""epidemic region""."
"The report from the meeting states that they're working on updating the quarantine list.At the moment, only China, S. Korea, Iran, and Italy are on it.John"
"Vietnam is currently implementing concentrated quarantine for 14 days, with citizens entering from 4 countries: China, South Korea, Iran and Italy, or people who have traveled through these 4 countries in the previous 14 days.The current quarantine site is mainly military barracks, a number of hospitals are also used. The number of people per room is arranged according to the military standard, an average of 5 people.The quarantined people will be provided with food (3 meals/day) and drink, ensure their personal needs, have enough phone and internet signal. They also receive care from military and medical personnel. Very comfortable condition!Edited: 10:53 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"My Ken interesting information and I am sure you will get some comments about ""very comfortable conditions."" I think most of us are more worried about getting quarantined for 14 days in an upgraded version of the Hanoi Hilton then getting sick. Of course comfortable is all relative to your expectations. I'm waiting to see what happens in the next three weeks to see if I cancel which would make me very very sad. I am commending the Vietnamese government for doing everything possible to stop the spread. Right now it is four countries, by tomorrow who knows."
"To put a lot of suspected cases together in one room all but guarantees that, if there is just one actual infection, all of them will get infected."
I just received this photo of a sign stuck on the wall at Moc Bai land border crossing.As it's a photo I will type it out.UPDATE 09/3:No Permit to enter Vietnam via Moc Bai from today for the following nationalities.1. Australia 2. Belgian3. Bulgaria4. Croatia5. Cyprus6. Czech7. Denmark8. Estonia9. Finland10. France11. Portugal12. Germany13. Greece14. Hungary15. Ireland16. Italy17. Latvia18. Luxembourg19. Malta20. Netherlands21. Poland22. Romania23. Slovakia24. Slovenia25. Spain26. SwedenMy personal opinion after correct some of the above countries spelling is that No1. Australia should infact read Austria as all the other countries are associated with Europe which Australia doesnt.So dont yet panic Aussies.
"The best thing to happen now will FCO says dont travel to Vietnam, Vietnam Airlines cancels all flights and everyone gets a full refund."
"> The best thing to happen now will FCO says dont travel to VietnamThe problem is that it's not particularly dangerous for UK citizens to visit Vietnam. The dangers fall on Vietnamese shoulders, so I'd expect the Vietnamese to be denying UK citizens entry rather than the FCO saying don't go. That would probably be enough, though."
"Yes, indeed they deny entry to anybody coming from the Schengen area or that has been there in the past 14 days. This probably to avoid sustaining the quarantining costs for all the toruists."
