I am set to arrive at end of October to Thailand. It sounds like Thailand is simply going to stay closed or limited to travelers? Should I just re book now or wait longer until September to see if they change their stance on the USA?
I really want to hold off....Very frustrating. Media is making everything look awful in US which is not the truth....I have reached out to the hotels to see if they would like be reschedule IF the US cannot come...they are all non-refundable. I dont want to go to bars or be around people. Just the beach and relax.
We are looking at May/June 2021. I am going to wait until September to see what happens (mid september). Does anyone see hope in them lifting to the USA? What gossip are you hearing?
"Curious #2....if all you want to do is lie on a beach and relax, can’t you do that much closer to home? Could likely be cheaper and no need to endure 20+ hours on a plane in each direction."
"There are lots of beaches much closer to relax at.""Media is making everything look awful in US which is not the truth""It is true...sometimes the truth hurts!"
"We like to go to exotic beaches/places. And yes, we are already going to beaches this year close by."

Shady math..34 million would not equal half the US population.Doesn't matter if they test more in Thailand or not.It would change the US facts.
"""#10 Thailand's rate of positivity is very low (about 1/2 of 1 percent), so they have done an adequate amount oftesting.

Few people are going to pay for testing in Thailand. We're talking 6K THB and up! The cases recorded are from symptomatic people. And, as infidel points out: https://postimg.cc/mhhkW383"
It wouldn't change the US facts.
What about the deaths?Are those from testing also?

"""death stats mean absolutely nothing.""Perhaps not on there own, flashed as a news headline, as you pointed out.

"If you look at deaths per capita, the USA is still behind Spain, Italy, UK, Sweden, France and only slightly ahead of the Netherlands, Ireland. And infections per capita is a totally useless number since you have no idea how many folks were sick and not reported due to lack of symptoms or minor symptoms. Governments, media and people are fixated on zeros not facts. It would be good to know how many of the deaths were healthy individuals before getting Covid versus how many were already seriously ill.Like previously mentioned, I know no one in the USA that has or has had Covid (actually don't even know of any friends of friends of friends that have taken ill).

Like I said .. fixated on zeroes. The per capita figures are essentially percentages and those percentages represent the risk incurred allowing a citizen in. Hence all the mentioned EU countries should be similarily banned.

"Yes CTM, lets look at hospitalization rates. Looking at weekly rates, not cummulative, which more accurately represents those who are sick at that moment in time and thus the risk of Amercians carrying the disease abroad ... the highest risk group, 65+ years old is 33 per 100,000 or 0.0033% of the popluation. The other age groups run about 12 for 50-64, 7 for 18-49, 3 for teenagers. So overall, less than 0.001% of the population.The agent orange 45 has definitely screwed the pooch when it comes to Covid, I won't argue that. BUT the USA is not the festering disease pot that you and the news media want to make it out as. An aspect that my previous comments about not knowing anyone relates to.With some precautions, face masks, pre-travel covid tests, etc there is no reason the remaining 99% percent of the US population could not travel. You folks were all doom and gloom when China was still traveling to Thailand early on, similar percentages of population effected. But with some controls, tracking, temperature checks, etc Thailand seems to have weathered the storm just fine.Rather than logically viewing the facts and taking proper precautions, the world seems to have preferred to panic and lock themselves away. Is the 2009 movie Surrogates our future?"

"7,700 x 365 = 2,813,503 and not even 1 % of population. That's offset by 3,788,235 people born, last year.Edited: 10:56 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"I also do not know one person that has had it or knows someone that had it. Also, the US is HUGE. The entire US shouldnt be dictated off some other states that refuse to wear masks and go to bars."
The number of daily COVID 19 cases is obviously increasing in the US and daily new cases are now higher than in March or April. Currently 15 % of all tests in Florida are positive. Almost 20% in Texas. Extremely high ratios otherwise only found in developing countries like Costa Rica or Colombia.Very little seems to have been achieved in the past 3 months in the USA and unfortunately no indication that things will improve dramatically by October.
"If the ""travel bubbke"" policy is fully implemented, then it is up to the Thai government to do a deal with any country as to who can come and under what circumstances.Although Prayuth likes Trump it's hard to see any circumstances soon when they would welcome US visitors....... Trump's attitude to Covid hasn't helped."
"aoertli,The fact that you don't know anyone who has been affected by the virus is irrelevant.I don't know anyone affected by dengue or malaria; does that mean they don't exist or are not an issue?"
"advenureTim,You can quote all the percentages you want.But, just yesterday Texas had over 10,000 hospitalizations.To their families, friends and love ones, who are struggling with this situation; this is very real.And to the families of the sick, hospitalized and the dead they are more than just a statistic."
"USA is low on the totem pole for Thailand tourism. Maybe 1 mill of the the 39 mill for 2019.All of 2.5% of that maybe 20% GDP for tourism. Don't think the USA would even make it into any conversation about 'bubbles' and who should be considered first. China & ASEAN countries .... if & when.You Yanks simple take advantage of the better everything, much closer and holiday in the Americas."
"I don't see how anyone can be trying to say that there's no problem with the virus in the US, or that it's 'not that bad' - it's pretty clear there's big problems. It doesn't matter that some of the bigger outbreaks are in certain states or areas of the US, as there's no real restriction on people's movements between states, from an international perspective, the whole of the US is in the same boat.You can say what you want about death rates, and whether the virus is responsible for those. Or whether there's more or less testing skewing the numbers. Fact of the matter is, that the virus is still actively spreading in the US, it hasn't been contained, and therefore any other country will work off the assumption that a person travelling out of the US is at high risk of having the virus. And therefore either will not be allowed in at all, or at least be subject to quarantine measures. Doesn't matter whether your entire family including second cousins twice removed and your neighbour 3 doors down have not had the virus, everyone from the country is a risk."
"CTM - I am not marginalizing the losses from the disease, they are emotional drains on the families. BUT this is a Travel Forum, not a health care forum, not an emotional support forum, not a CA (covid anonymous) forum.This thread is about the risks posed by Americans traveling internationally. AND that risk is evaluated by looking at the percentages of infected Americans at any point in time. People allow zeros to blind them and refuse to look past them to see the facts. And the news media loves zeros, because it make for more exciting news. An additional 500 cases sounds so so, but a 50% increase, wow now thats something to worry about. But even a 100% increase in cases means the hospitalization rate goes from 0.001% to 0.002% of the popluation. It would take a one hundred thousand percent increase in cases just to reach 1% of the US population.Bottom line however, is that ANY country with active cases could send the disease abroad via a citizen that is asymptomatic. Therefore ALL countries should require pre-testing and ALL who are clear shoud be allowed to travel. Those tests should be given twice, 10 days prior and within 72 hours of departure and perhaps a swab upon arrival. Countries that want tourists to visit should subsidize the tests within their country (yes you need to get the same tests before flying home to avoid returning with the disease). Countries that want to rejuvinate their outbound tourism businesses should subsidize outbound tests."

"""Thailand proposes a 3 phase “travel bubble” strategy""""A travel pact or “bubble” with 3 distinct stages, is expected to be agreed to with countries that have had similar success to Thailand in suppressing the Covid-19 virus and that have gone at least 30 days without recording any new cases.

"What's currently in the press is obviously just speculation. To limit visitors to only come from countries that are free from the pandemic for 30 days would eliminate China, Japan and South Korea and leave only Taiwan and Vietnam in Asia. That's unlikely to happen. There is no WHO definition of low risk but the EU does such an assessment: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-d…According to that below 20 cases per 100 000 population within 14 days is considered low-risk. And there are plenty of countries below that threshold."

"I think many people can think for themselves, and simply don't trust the MSM, for good reason. Especially since it's been exposed, it seem no matter what the cause of death, if C19 was present, or even suspected, whether tested for or not, then it's listed as a 'C19 death' per CDC rules. That's just silly.Especially considering the amount of people that die from seasonal flu every year. Add the people who die from HAI, , shy of 100k a year in USA hospitals, and again, if C19 is suspected, then listed as such. Many, most of HAI symptoms, respiratory, are the same as C19.Fairly obvious, CDC, WHO, UN, Gates foundation, that financed the C19 models predicting the doom and gloom scenario, are doing everything they can, (false stats), in an effort to meet those silly numbers. The new CDC rules for listing deaths as C19 are pretty silly. NO CONFIRMED TEST NEEDED.Big pharm is pushing it also, so they can get more billions of tax dollars, above the billions they got already, for that vaccine, that if follows all other flu type vaccines will only be 40 % effective ... if lucky.It's all about the money.Take the 20 - 70k possible seasonal flu deaths a year, add the shy of 100k HAI deaths a year, and how many of those are now being listed as C19 deaths. Can you really trust any of the numbers ???Not taking into consideration, the old people, who were on their last leg to begin with, being listed as C19 deaths, as been reported. Don't even have to add the silly ones, accidents and such reported as C19 deaths, simply because testing positive for coronavirus anitbodies, and sometimes not even specific C19 antibodies, but simply coronavirus antibodies, which most people have present in their bodies.UP2U what & who to believe."

"You do make a good point Tim about the Winter Flu. I doubt you would be picking up on the news about that unless you are in Australia or NZ.Very interesting, that Reports of Flu this year compared to last year are very low. The reason has been put down to a number of facts. Firstly all the distancing and large crowds not gathering. Secondly is with the Vaccination, the Government went hard and fast with this, Australia has enough to Vaccinate a large number of the population. I would say they will be throwing away a lot.While we refer to it as winter Flu, you can get it anytime of the year, I got the worst one in November one year. In winter we spend more time indoors and therefore more contact with people , thus allowing it to spread. I got it when in Thailand during their winter , which is quite Hot and Humid . So much like like heat wave in the UK during Summer.The Flu Vax is not 100% . As a person gets older say from 70 years it reduces down to 50%.

"My whole country almost came to a screeching halt based on speculation of billions of infections worldwide and millions dead in my country. In February predictions for the US were for millions dead! (Good thing the border was closed early preventing millions of infections from invaders! Against objections that the president was bigoted and racist to do so!)https:/…80036aa11cd0https://www.cato.org/blog/how-one-model-simu…https:/…Like with ordinary annual flu, some people are affected more than others. One way or another this pandemic (or scamdemic) will be a lasting tribute to yellow journalism.* Still hoping for the best and a successful vaccine for future infections! My opinion, for my country, when our election is over in November things will definitely change!"
"""My opinion, for my country, when our election is over in November things will definitely change!""----------But then, will we be the better off with the next fiasco !?!"
"""The most dangerous aspect of Covid is the news and social media plague, not the disease itself.""Hmm..tell that to the families of the dead!"
"Sorry Infidel,The border was not closed early to visitors/travelers from Europe.Those infected visitors/travelers were the primary spreaders, causing US infections.Edited: 10:39 am, July 05, 2020 "
The most devastating group of spreaders were infected patients forced into nursing homes.
"93.""Sorry Infidel,The border was not closed early to visitors/travelers from Europe.""-Imagine what the response would be if Trump had immediately closed traffic from Europe too. The border closing with Mexico and forbidding flights/visitors from China was heavily criticized in the press and especially by Trump's political opponents. https:/… * Governors ordering infected patients into nursing homes caused the most damage but hardly any criticism from the press. One of these guilty governors was trying to call the infection the ""European Virus"" for some stupid reason. Maybe to shift the blame from himself to Europeans???Finding Coronavirus infections is easy if you check millions of people. When the death count goes past 2500 then it will be as bad as this past April. Today the daily death count is about 250. Holiday weekend, people working the numbers off until Monday morning. The figures should be a little higher by Monday night. https:/…countries"

"#92 CTM - Yes and while you are at it, why not tell them why Agent Orange and the Repugnanticans didn't do more to slow the spread. Anyone can play the emotional / political game all day long, however this forum is about travel.Opening of destinations, resumption of travel should be based solely on accurate facts, not emotional beliefs. But thanks to media and social media hysteria, emotions rule over logical reasoning. The millions of people employed / formerly employed in tourism around the world, need people to think objectively and start working towards an answer. Quit hiding behind tears and zeros."
"#93 & #95 - Closing borders to foreigners is not the silver bullet, it is a nationalistic band-aid. A country's citizens can carry the disease into their homeland just as easily. Things like washing hands, disinfectant hand lotions at store entrances, temperature checks, facemasks (like Thailand did) contributes far more to warding off the spread than targeting a specific nationality."
"Closing the borders obviously works, but at what costs. Since all new cases are coming from returnees, under strict scrutiny, shows that process isn't foolproof at all. If worried about incoming infections (I'm not) then keep the borders closed.As stated "" Things like washing hands, disinfectant hand lotions at store entrances, temperature checks, (like Thailand did) contributes far more to warding off the spread ""I took face masks out of that quote, as they are totally useless, and actually make a bad situation, worse.http://tiny.cc/zq2yrz"
The USA didn't close its borders. It only blocked a few specific nationailities.
"The answer is to Close Borders and Quarantine those coming in for 14 days, such as residences returning home. Just look at New Zealand and the success there. While 14 days might not be 100% it is very good.The purpose is to stop in the free Import and then export.Here in Australia the State of New South Wales ,the only new cases are those in Quarantine. Sadly the state of Victoria not so good . They are going to close that border shortly.Any way , I put a note in my Diary a in May after seeing a report on the News and Donald Trump. The note refers that the President said the Covid 19 will be all over on 16 July.. He did say in March it was going to be the same on Easter Sunday (12 April)Chok Dee"
"Do they still spray arrivals before deplaning? I remember a clown with a Captain Kangaroo outfit sprayed some aerosol over the passengers, back when I visited in the '80s."
"OctoberSix.No they do not ,I do remember this coming back into Australia in the 80s.Perhaps they might start again 555.Chok Dee"
"Yeah, perhaps spray with Lysol and Clorox ....or bright lights!!!Sorry I could not resist!"
"#97.""Yes and while you are at it, why not tell them why Agent Orange and the Repugnanticans didn't do more to slow the spread.""-Not sure what you are talking about. If a VA claim for Agent Orange illnesses for service in Vietnam during the past 2 years it has become easier to get a disability claim approved. Something else only you know. Something in the US maybe contact your state Attorney General or Monsanto. .Good luck anyway."
"#105 - wow really, did that reference really go right over your head? Or are you just having us on?Agent orange ... orange hair ... #45 ... Repugnanticans ... repub-lick-ians ... 45's loyal minions"

"Yes; we can close it now that you shared your 2 satang ...Edited: 2:54 am, July 07, 2020 "
"We too have booked and paid for flights 7th nov, our U.K. government are stating no travel to Thailand.We cancelled our hotel with booking.com they were very good and our money is being refunded. So now we wait to see if our government allow us to travel ,or is it Thailand who do not want us from the U.K. It gas to be safe to travel I get that it’s the waiting to see if yes or no. As for the USA. I have family there they tell me the situation is not very good do maybe you won’t get there either.Tough for us all at this time but we have to do what our governments are telling us ..Our Motorhome holiday to France in June was cancelled, hubby working through this crisis my 65 in Oct nit a great year but we’re still alive we have to be thankful for that ."
"linda sNot much any of us can do other than use common sense and hopefully one day a Vaccine will be our option.Thailand like many countries have closed the border to non Nationals. This is to reduce the importing of Covid 19 and also the export.The USA is currently a mess, but one would expect that , so sitting at around 450 deaths per million. Compare that to New Zealand with 4 deaths per one million. Locked Down early and have just about wiped it out.UK Government was slow to act and The PM did say he really did not understand Covid 19 early on . So he nearly paid with his live.Following cases around the world , it will be some time till travel looks like pre Covid 19.I think may counties once Vaccine (If) will have this as requirement to enter. If you look at Polio , it took years to get the Vaccination rate high enough across the world.Counties like the UK have one thing going for them, Namely the NHS. Australia has Medicare. It will be interesting to see what the USA does.Chok Dee"
"Not a good comparison with polio.There is no guarantee that a vaccine will be a cure-all for Covid. It is far more likely that it will be like a flu vaccine that changes and has restricted though important beneficial effects. It may not even stop carriers spreading the disease.I think people need to get used to the idea of a permanent or ling term presence of Covud... and let's hope like many viruses, it doesn't mutate to become more virulent."
"Linda""So now we wait to see if our government allow us to travel ,or is it Thailand who do not want us from the U.K.""It is most likely that Thailand will not want ir at least be very wary of visitors from UK.Keep an eye on the TAT website. The concept of travel bubbles seems to be dying a death so it it more likely that last minute health tests will be required and restrictions on travel within the kingdom."
