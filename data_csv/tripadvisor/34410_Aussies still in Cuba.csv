They have their returning flight on March 30 via Cancun-LA- Sydney and wondering about the latest news in Australia on Covid-19. Is Australia already closing their airports for arrivals from the US? Any official info already released?Any helpful info or suggestions welcome.
Is the US open to flights from Mexico?
"This from Qantas website:All Qantas and Jetstar international flights from Australia will be suspended from the end of March until at least 31 May 2020. Some additional services may be considered to assist with repatriation. More than 150 aircraft will be grounded during this time, including all of Qantas’ A380s, 747s and B787s."
Thanks for the info. Still the key questions are like SBN # 1 wondered:a- Are US airports accepting fights from Mexico?b- Is Australia accepting flights from the States?
"Hi Voy, I’ve checked on-line with US Embassy in Mexico, and related to Covid-19 they write (as of March 18): Entry and Exit Requirements: • There are no entry or exit restrictions in place because of COVID-19.• Mexico has implemented temperature-screening measures at some of its airports. Passengers with abnormal temperatures and travel to high-risk areas might be subject to additional health screening.• Beyond standard travel documentation, travelers to Mexico do not require any additional documentation to enter or exit.***That site is updated whenever there are changes. It's no problem to get out of Mexico, but I'm still looking for info on getting into the USA. I'll try to find info on your second question.Edited: 9:15 am, March 19, 2020 "
Thanks a lot Madrugada.There are a handful of customers of mine from Australia still in here happy to end up their planned tours but still worried about getting stuck in Mexico or the US on return back home.
"According to Centre for Disease Control, there are no restrictions to enter USA from Mexico:https:/…from-other-countries.htmlUSA Homeland Security’s latest posted update about Covid-19 is March 12 makes no mention of any restriction for anyone arriving from Mexico.Edited: 9:27 am, March 19, 2020 "
My friend missed his plane yesterday. After hours on the phone it was determined that the only way he was getting back was through the agent that did the original booking. If they booked through a travel agent that is who they need to contact.If booked directly through the airline that is who they need to call.If they have not provided a contact number in Cuba to the travel provider they should try to do it now. At the least check to see if their flight has been bumped up to get them home earlier than planned.
Rat - that is probably the strict position but some airlines might be more flexible than others.
