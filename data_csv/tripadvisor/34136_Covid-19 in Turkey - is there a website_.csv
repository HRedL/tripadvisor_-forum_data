"Heading for Turkey next week. Like many travelers, I've been trying to follow the latest news of the Covid-19 (""Coronavirus 2019""). Can anyone recommend a good (reliable, credible) website with info on the current status of the virus in/around Turkey?At the time I'm writing this, as best I can tell, there have been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Turkey. But...there have been in multiple countries that border on Turkey (Greece, Georgia, Syria and Iran). As we have seen elsewhere in the world, national borders are not stopping this virus, so while Turkey appears to have had no cases YET, it seems inevitable to me that it will come to Turkey (it's also quite possible, perhaps likely, that it's already circulating in many countries that have not confirmed cases yet, including Turkey). Personally, I suspect that it's going to be widespread in every country in the world, it's just a matter of time before that becomes impossible to ignore. We'll see if I'm being too pessimistic.I note that the situation in neighboring Iran looks particularly concerning, as it does not seem from the outside that the government there is being forthcoming about the extent of the virus spread. The situation along parts of the Syrian border, which was already dire, has also gone from bad to worse in recent days - not exactly a good situation in which to try and manage a pandemic.As a visitor about to embark on a trip to Turkey, I'm not going to panic (I recognize that these troubling events are taking place far from where most tourists go), but I will be taking reasonable precautions while visiting Turkey (washing my hands a lot, being careful about ""social distance"", avoiding dense crowds, etc.). One of those precautions will be to try and stay informed about the spread of the virus (and about government reactions to events on the ground - including the potential closure of places where many people gather in crowds...like major tourist sites - other countries have been taking such steps, eg Japan has closed their Disney parks).I'm trying to not ""freak out"" and I'm not trying to scare others. But I'd like to find a good source of up-to-date information about Covid-19 in Turkey that I can check while I'm traveling around Turkey. If would be ideal if it were available in an English-language version (but I can probably get by using Google-translate).Does anyone know of such a website? Thank you."
Not any confirmed case but also not any info officially available. Turkey has set up a special hospital in Ankara where passengers evacuated from infected countries stay for quarantine..
"Recep would not allow anything negative to be posted about ""his""monarchy. He and AKP lie about everything.Think: Donald J. Trump."
"cagcag, I understand. And I never said it needed to be an official Turkish government website - in fact, it doesn't need to be based in Turkey at all. I am in the USA. If the CDC website (US Centers for Disease Control, the government health agency) is suspect, I can check the Canadian government website that I trust.I know that there are many, many UK citizens who visit Turkey (maybe the most foreign visitors?). Perhaps a UK site would be good for me to check?"
"I wish, Japetus and cagcag, that in this case at least you gave information rather than opinion.OP: The same site as that I use for everything SARS-CoV-2 related. https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6The most foreign visitors are Russian followed by German. You could use their site, if you wish.Edited: 8:33 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"GG. I appreciate your comments. I also appreciate the link for current status of Covid-19.My point was that even if this virus were to exist currently in Turkey, the Government would deny it as a coverup.In reality, how is it possible that this virus exists in more than 50 countries, including neighboring ons as Iran, Greece, Georgia, Iraq and Bulgaria and not a single documented case in Turkey?The existence or not of this virus in Turkey should not be the determining factor as to whether to visit Turkey or not.Only my point is that to be trusted, a county's leadership must be transparent and honest."
"GG, thanks for the link to the Johns Hopkins website (I already had that one, I was looking for something more granular).I would agree with cagcag, insofar as the data source must be credible to be useful. This is not the appropriate place to discuss politics so I won't go there, but I will share my opinion that as the virus spreads, the conspicuous absence of any reported presence of it in a large nation that receives many international visitors will become suspect. Based on what I saw from the BBC (a source I would generally trust for most things), the government of Iran is not being completely forthcoming about the number of deaths in Iran from the virus. I'm sure there are other governments that have not been transparent in reporting. It's possible that any government might choose to do the same. That is, of course, extremely dangerousI would still welcome links to any credible info about the virus in Turkey. I am not saying it's there now, but if you simply look at its spread around the world, it seems logical to expect that it will appear in Turkey at some point (if it hasn't already).> The most foreign visitors are Russian followed by German. You could use their site, if you wish.Personally, I would not put much faith in a Russian site, but would be inclined to trust an official German one. Does anyone have a link to such a German site? Thank you.Edited: 10:37 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"cagcag, yes, I realised you were making that point.However, it is worth going into the models for the dissemination of the disease, and if you were to do so you would find that it has spread exactly as predicted, with the exception of Indonesia. Turkey is not on the list of countries that should be affected in the first wave of transmission.Second, before making sweeping statements about the government's ability to keep things under wraps, I'd go into the twitterverse, search for ""koronavirüs"" and see for myself the (over)zealous reporting by Turkish citizens. Little remains unearthed, even if with a delay or two.Third, I remember the same government's responses during the SARS and the swine/bird flu epidemics, and there is really not much to suggest that a coverup is going on. Not trusting the government or feeling that it is truthful is one thing, allowing this to colour our opinions is another. The Turkish government is not composed of prize idots, nor are Turks the most closed-mouthed of people. There is currently no benefit to covering up this illness, and given the number of people involved, I very seriously doubt it could be.We may like or dislike, approve or disapprove of a country's leadership, certainly. That is a discussion for another type of forum. But without looking at the models, considering the logistics of a cover-up, or following matters through other means, the information content of such remarks is not terribly high, and its truthfulness in the mind of its utterer.The fact that the virus has spread around Turkey on the outside is indicative of a high risk of it having started to spread within Turkey, true. But by that logic, Bulgaria, which is totally surrounded by the disease should also have it, while Brazil should not. It doesn't work like that. I'm far more concerned about the Nigerian who picked up the virus in Italy; he flew to Italy via Istanbul, and I assume he flew back the same way.I would expect the first cases of SARS-CoV- 2 to be reported in Turkey over the next two weeks. However, I shall remain in Istanbul and not go back to London, in the vague hope that the forecasts that this, like the flu, will become less virulent as the weather improves."
"@lowflyerguy, I will be quite straightforward with you. First, I'd suggest reading my response above.Second, you are quite right. This is a country with huge amounts of visitors. However, the total number who visit in December-January-February is less than the number who visit each month in July or August, and about equal to the number who visit in June and September.Third, the total number of Chinese tourists who visited Turkey last year made up 0.9% of the total. While a considerable amount of business is done with China, we are not in the same position as Iran, which lacks the ability to trade with and seek investment from all but a few nations.Fourth, the combined number of Italians and Iranians who visit Turkey is considerably higher: 2.5 million (just over 5.5% of the total). Leaving Chinese tourists and Italians formerly resident in China aside, the first domestic case of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy was reported on 16th February. The current surge started on the 22nd. Assuming symptomatic cases in Turkey as a result of that ignores the delays due to this virus's long incubation period.Fifth, I, together with anyone not American, am extremely dubious about the US's capability to deal with this outbreak, given tha about a fifth of its population is afraid of going to the hospital due to the costs involved combined with the fact that hospitals there seem to be charging for their stays due to SARS-CoV-2. The same does not apply in Turkey. You will no doubt be appalled at this, but I'd rather be in Turkey during an epidemic than the US.Sixth, while I'd rather get cutting-edge treatment in the US, an epidemic requires simple isolation and a lot of hospital beds. Totally fortuitously, Turkey has a lot of recently closed hospitals (the state hospitals are being re-organised into central, much larger facilities), which can be quickly repurposed. The US does not have excess hospitals, and the number of appropriate isolation rooms is 1/190th of the total available.Seventh, and finally, the fact that the Minsitry of Health does not have a website dedicated to the virus is neither here nor there. The NHS doesn't have one either, except in the form of general advice about handwashing and distancing. If that's all you need, here you go:https:/…https:/…2019-n-cov.htmlFeel free to click on ""Afiş/broşürler"" for posters you can hang around the office or home, ""Sunumlar"" for presentations for the general public and health personnel, etc and so forth. Sorry that it's in Turkish, but I'm sure you'll be able to do a rough translation using google or your browser.Why am I going on like this? During outbreaks of this kind, people naturally go on the basis of what they know and what they fear. Whether people know Turkey or not is not generally a big deal for me, but given the seriousness of the virus, I fear I cannot let your (cagcag and lowflyerguy) statements and opinions go unchallenged. At the end of the day, whether people travel or not is up to them. What they write, however, affacts others.Edited: 12:36 am, March 01, 2020 "
"GG. As always you have provided a thorough and thoughtful response.I would have expected no less from you.Thanks again as always.Edited: 12:41 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Thank you GG for your insightful and reasonable responses. You make many valid points, and I appreciate you filling me in on a variety of details of which I was not aware. I have no argument with what you have said, except to note that you seem to have made some surprising assumptions about my own views and preferences which are not at all accurate, and I'm not sure what it was I wrote that seems to have offended you. Your observations of the relative benefits and shortcomings of my own nation's health care system seem about right to me, and you'll get no argument on that. Despite your assertion to the contrary, I would neither be appalled nor delighted in your preference to be in Turkey or anyplace else during a public health crisis, I don't know where you got that idea. And I am equally mystified by what you might think I wrote above that can not or should not go unchallenged.I was not trying to assert anything other than a sincere interest in locating a source of information that I and other visitors might use to help make wise choices as I travel, and was merely speculating that no country is likely to remain untouched by this virus, whether or not that fact becomes evident and visible one way or another. But it seems that something I said touched a nerve. My apologies for that, it was not my intention to provoke or offend. I can not fathom what I wrote that did, but I sincerely appreciate your response here and your many helpful contributions. I wish you well."
"There might have not been confirmed cases in Turkey, but a passenger carrying corona virus passed through Istanbul Airport on Friday morning. The Israeli man was returning home from Japan, taking flight TK53 from Tokyo to Istanbul, then flight TK784 to Tel Aviv. He was detected with corona virus soon after landing in Tel Aviv. Source;https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Third-pe… Not sure how much the media in Turkey has reported about this case."
"They are taking it seriously--I know as my traveling companion and I were both put in isolation in a public hospital in Turkey for three days after getting a ""cold"" while traveling in Thailand and Cambodia during January. We were staying with Turkish friends in Istanbul in late January and got sick enough to seek treatment. Pneumonia with fever... Despite no cases reported in Thailand or Cambodia at the time the doctor at the private clinic said we MUST be tested and isolated until test results were received and then still self-quarantine until for at least another week before flying home.I'm now waiting to see if travel insurance will actually pay. I've used it many times but never made a claim."
"@SwampeastMike - I am happy to hear you are feeling better, and thank you for sharing your experience. I am glad to hear that the medical establishment seems to be taking the threat seriously.I assume you were treated for the pneumonia/fever and you responded well to the treatment (and your test results were negative, otherwise you would still be in the hospital). Are you still there or have you returned home yet? Hope you are feeling much better! And thank you for sharing your experience."
"Yes, we were treated for pneumonia but it had to continue after our return home the 2nd week of February. And yes, the tests were all negative."
"All COVID-19 tests in Turkey are handled centrally at the National Virology Reference Laboratory of the General Directorate of Public Health (source: https://hsgm.saglik.gov.tr/tr/bulasici-hastaliklar/2019-n-cov/liste/2019-ncov-sik-sorulan-sorular.html). As of March 5, a total of 1,363 persons had been tested, supposedly all of them negative."
"I saw that number in February, and not the 29th. It has not been updated."
"It must be realized that Turkey's regime has no relation to Wests Democratic Standards nor the Turkish society has ever experienced or ""melted historically with European enlightenment and meaning of Republic.. Thousands of journalists prisoners, control on social media and TV etc. I hope not but I am afraid that Turkey is gonna pop up on the covid-19 frontline of the pandemic because of the regime."
"Good to hear from you again, lowflyerguy. Sorry your plans had to change, IIRC.Let us all try to keep our spirits high in these trying times, in my case only possible through added liquids. :)"
