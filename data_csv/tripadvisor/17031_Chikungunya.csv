Hello !Are there any reports of Chikunguyna having arrived in the PV region ? It seems like it's epidemic in southern Mexico and is likely to spread to other regions.Tina
There was a sign at the Guadalajara airport warning travelers about chikungunya. But I haven't heard anything about it reaching Puerto Vallarta yet.
74 cases in southern Mexico is hardly epidemic. It appears to be worse in Central America.
What is it?

"Interesting, especially since the mosquitos in PV took some major chunks out of me recently (Deep Woods OFF didn't seem to work). However, re post #1, I was in the Guadalajara bus station for an extended period the day after jaimexplorer was leaving from the airport and wandered all over, as I got there early. No notices there. I would think the notices in the airport and the bus stations (Zapopan, for me) in the same major city would be consistent. Nice to ""accidently"" meet you in a restaurant in Tlaquepaque a week ago, jaimexplorer, so I remember what day you left.I'd be curious to know what that notice looked like, that was at GDL but not in the bus station.Something to be aware of but not get into a panic about, as so many things in Mexico? Also, there were no mosquitos (that decided to attack me, and I'm a bug-magnet) in Guadalajara.Edited: 5 years ago "
Don't forget the biggest threat - Alcohol!
"It's a new 'threat"" that is getting press now that Lindsay Lohan has been diagnosed with a rare incurable disease od Chikungunya. She picked it up in the south Pacific."
"Any updates on this re: reaching PV? It's epidemic in French Polynesia. Have read that it originated in the Caribbean. Was there in September, Moorea, Tahiti, Rangiroa and Marquesasa Is. and had a few rainy days with no winds. Got many bites but fortunately no Dengue or Chikungunya. I have some Autan that I plan on applying liberally in Feb. and Mar. TIA"
No updates because it's a non issue here.
HAHAHA I thought this was going to be a thread about some local dish I never heard about!!!
"""Lindsay Lohan?...incurable disease""? Yah, chikungunya must be another term for alcoholism. You were right, JR. Lol!"
