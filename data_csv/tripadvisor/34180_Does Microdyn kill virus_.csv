We have some here at home. Thinking about using it on some produce.... if it kills virus. Anybody know?
It's anti-bacterial not anti-viral.
Thanks for that. Another method it is then.
We wash fruit and vegetables with 3% hydrogen peroxide which is an effective antiviral.
"Here's the EPA list of Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2...https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/l…""Microdyne"" isn't in the list.I think the CDC has a similar list.Edited: 3:17 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"The list is not food grade disinfectants. For produce, it's suggested you wash it well, and store for a day before using if possible. The virus is not know to last on organic produce."
Okay. Thank you. I’ll either let produce sit for a couple days or soak in dilute bleach technique. Or maybe both.
"Cerveza, 151 Rum, Vodka, etc all kill the virus"

"Washing you hands with antibacterial soap does kill the virus so maybe your answer is there. Just a thought as asking a bunch of quacks on TA (including myself) probably isn’t the best way to get good info but can be very entertaining.Now the boss will want to come back and correct me that it’s all soap not just antibacterial soap that kills the virus and post a link.Edited: 11:01 am, April 04, 2020 "
Just curious...who is the boss you are referring to?
"Soap destroys the virus because the virus has a 'fatty' membrane that is broken down by the soap. The virus isn't technically 'alive' and 'killed'. The soap inactivates the virus. Antibacterial soaps aren't a good choice for food, it can leave harmful chemicals. Castile soap is safer.Edited: 4:59 pm, April 04, 2020 "
"Judy, that would be Eljefe. He seems to have a link to everything COVID-19."
Beer and regular vodka do not kill the virus
"#14 - just ignore him, he's just trolling."
others might think he knows what he is talking about
"It is one thing to post because one is emotionally needy, it is quite another thing to make false comments that can harm others if they believe you."
ElJefe KNOWS the rules of posting information and that links are needed. Notice that when he posts he always has the link at the bottom Notice I do that also with any hotel information or travel information. TOOOOO bad that others who constantly reference seeing something in the Gazette or elsewhere do not have links. TripAdvisor requires any copied information to have that link...so let's all do it and not complain about information that ElJefe is posting. He reads and knows his stuff...so don't rag on him. I for one am so happy to see him back on the forum and appreciate his work.
"This is TripAdvisor not any place that you should use for COVID-19 info. Eljefe posts some good links but that is for the reader to decide. I work for a hospital system so I follow what our chief medical officer sends to us. Some of us need to understand what is posted here is just someone venting, let it go. And all this on this thread has to do what with the OP’s question? Now go out and buy more TP!"

I also like the links. Very helpful. Still scratching my head figuring out why anyone would find the provision of a link offensive. Oh well.
According to this article. Microdyne is effective at killing viruses as well as bacteria.  https:/…
The Cabo sun kills the virus! Salud!
<>That's why no one in BCS has contracted the virus. If however you could get your internal body temperature up to between 132F - 150F you could kill the virus. Only one problem - heat stroke starts at ~ 104F and temperatures higher than that can lead to death unless treated quickly. Salud!
Big El: Been tested and we are all Neg like most healthy people. Cabo time May 3rd!
