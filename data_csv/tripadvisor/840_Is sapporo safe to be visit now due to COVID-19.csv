"Hi, should i proceed my plan going to sapporo this coming 27Feb-4Mar? I worried about COVID-19 which currently already hit sapporo."
"No one can say it's safe to come to Hokkaido now with 8 people found to be infected with the virus until now, including a 10 year boy living in Furano diagnosed today. Although Japan is now in the Stage of ""Intra-city Spreading of the Virus"", it still is in its ""Early Stage"", according to many experts in infectious disease in Japan, so it might not be very dangerous now. So, whether to come or not depends on you.https:/…105635104BTW, how is the situation in Malaysia now? I wonder why this virus suddenly spread in winter is resistant to hot weather? Is there any sign in Malaysia, which suggest that this virus is weak against hot weather?"
So are u going? Cause my flight is on 28feb and still thinking..
"Hello, the situation in Malaysia is stable. There has been 22 cases and 15 discharged from hospital and no death thus far.The community carries on as usual and almost no one wearing a mask. Perhaps the hot humid weather that is unbearable at times has played a positive role. I’m just guessing.The child in Furano with the virus, do you know if it is a local transmission? Or a foreigner carrying it into Japan?Thanks Mabei0123, your information has been very helpful."
"The brothers? The media is reporting that they often went to the neighboring Ski resorts to enjoy snowboarding, which is also popular among international tourists."
re this local website the confirmed cases in Hokkaido is 31 as of 25th Feb.https:/…641eba7fef234a47880e1e1dc4de85ce
Hokkaido just declared state of emergency a few hours ago
"Azni, did you go ahead with your trip to Hokkaido? If yes, how's the situation there?"
"Are you now in Sapporo? Few people go out there, don't they? Department Stores are open in limited time in Sapporo, right?"
Would also like to know if you went and how was it? We are due to fly Monday and still aren't sure about it.
They started to sanitirize the Subway often.
My flight is 28 March to Sapporo. So disappointed that AirAsia is still not announce can cancel or postpone date of flight.
How is the situation in Sapporo now? I purchase tickets for Sept this year. Praying the situation will get better.
