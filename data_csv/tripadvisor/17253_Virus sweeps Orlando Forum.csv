"Having worked through my ""Secrets"" post, I thought at first that people could not read, then, I thought maybe they just dont understand but now I think that they (and sometimes me) suffer from this virus!Symptoms:1. Causes you to send the same e-mail twice. Done that! 2. Causes you to send a blank e-mail ! That too!3. Causes you to send e-mail to the wrong person. Yep! 4. Causes you to send it back to the person who sent it to you. Aha! 5. Causes you to forget to attach the attachment. Well darn! 6. Causes you to hit ""SEND"" before you've finished. Oh, no - not again! 7. Causes you to hit ""DELETE"" instead of ""SEND.."" and I just hate that! 8. Causes you to hit ""SEND"" when you should ""DELETE."" Oh No!IT IS CALLED THE ""C-NILE VIRUS."""

Probably attributable to overwork on your part. I can't imagine how many hours you have spent on this one topic.
I will reply once I get myself off the floor
Ha ha...been there...especially 6 and 7!! x

Ha ha. Numptyitis! Love it. There's definitely an epidemic on here at the moment. I rather like it though. Never found email addresses as amusing before. :)

Ha ha ha!!!!!!
Did anyone notice that people put their email address on the Mousesavers' forum posts when they want a copy of that month's newsletter?Perhaps they should also be directed to do a PM to someone who has the newsletter? What do you guys think?Di
pt bird. good idea but do you really think anyone will take any notice after this debacle??? I seriously doubt it :(
"What I always wonder is, if they don't know mousesavers exists, how do they know to ask for it every month on exactly the right day. Why are they always traveling next week but never post a tr. Why if your traveling next week have you not already looked into buying tickets yet?.....Aaand relax. Rant over. Sorry about that. Lol"
"thanks Di, now I am on the floor again"
stop it partypa I'm nearly on the floor with you....
while you are on the floor..is there any snacks down there......seriously funny guys....josie
I just found a mince pie
It's mine !
I've fallen - and I can't get up!I believe C-Nile is caused by Chinners' Blood Sucking Bugs With Teeth On. Numptyitis is a direct consequence of spending all freakin' day on TA!
