"There is much talk of the airlines, but what about the car rental business ?According to the French reference newspaper 'Le Monde' , Europcar is already in dire straits and the French state is attempting to save it."
How is Goldcar doing.?Badly I hope
"Well they've been ripping customers off over everything from full/empty tank, imaginary damage, compulsory expensive additional cover, the list goes on.Won't be missed."
I must say I let out a brief Ah! rather than an Aww! when I saw that thread title.My bad.
"End of the road for ""Le Mondeo"" as reported in ""Le Monde""?"
"Yes,it is an overall economic debate. Must the state help financially, and save, all the companies in all the sectors ? And if it is selective, how to choose which businesses must survive and which must sink ?"
"PierreWI am not sure how Governments will dish out the aid to companies.I hope that they will look at which companies have paid big dividends to shareholders in Monaco ( you know who you are), directors that have paid themselves big salaries and bonuses and those who have not saved anything ""for a rainy day""I say we should give priority to those companies with a good reputation for treating their customers well. I hope that Ryanair never need help as they will be goosed."
Airport in Florida. Car rental company is having a fire sale.3500 carshttps://globalnews.ca/news/6784573/coronavirus-rental-car-fire-florida/.

Messed it up first time
If a company is hanging on by the skin of their teeth then they won't be able to weather this.A company that has balanced it's books well and treated it's customers well should have some money aside for a bad spell.Granted this is going to go on but for government aid the business accounts should be taken into consideration.
"Europcar was already in financial difficulty before this crisis.Yes, it is no use to help financially companies or even whole sectors (cruise business ?) which seem doomed anyway."

If Goldcar goes to the wall I'll be jumping for joy.
