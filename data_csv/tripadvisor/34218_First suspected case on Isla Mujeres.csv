"From Por Esto, Google translationISLA MUJERES, March 26.- This Wednesday afternoon the first suspected case of coronavirus was registered in Isla Mujeres, however, it will be confirmed or not this Friday with the results of the laboratory study, said Leily Osorio Mares, director of the Hospital Community.The patient is at home and had contact early this Thursday with the official. It is stable and in home isolation, in accordance with the protocol to contain and mitigate the spread of this virus, under the circumstances of Phase 2 of the contingency.Osorio Mares stressed that for the moment there is no positive case in this municipality, he said that those who become infected will be recommended to confine themselves to their home to wait 14 days when the body achieves its own recovery, because at the moment there is no medicines to face the disease, or vaccines.The identity of the patient was not disclosed, however, there is talk of a tourist services vendor at the maritime terminal, who is presumed to have been infected, if it were confirmed that he is ill, by contact with a tourist.PLEASE STAY HOME AND URGE OTHERS TO DO SO. All of the cases in Cancun are either tourists or in the tourism industry. DO NOT EXPOSE US TO THIS. To advocate travel here (or anywhere) right now is foolish and irresponsible."
"Unfortunately, Isla is so heavily touristed that I was afraid it was just a matter of time. :("
"Surprised it didn't happen sooner. If confirmed with virus it will be just the start of more and all those who think they will be traveling to Isla in April, May and June better think twice cause it won't happen. The USA hasn't peeked yet and getting worse. EVERYONE STAY HOME and STAY SAFE!!! God Bless the people and this beautiful Island."
Wow. Something like this could ravage a tiny island. Hope it isn’t true.
They should have stopped the tourists over a month ago. For some reason they are still letting tourists come across on the ferry. It was only a matter of time. Stay safe my Isla family and friends!
"It's too bad Isla isn't following Holbox's lead. Holbox is not permitting any tourists whatsoever or for any reason to cross to the island. There's also several tourist communities in the Yucatan that are not allowing tourists in. They've set up checkpoints at the entrances to the municipality and if you don't live there, you are simply turned away. No exceptions.Same with Chetumal. Unless you can prove you live there or have essential business there you're barred from entering."
Holbox is smart.
Time to so what other towns in Mexico are doing. Caccoon the island as much as possible.
Has the case been confirmed? They said they'll know by Friday.
I haven't heard anything yet. I will ask my doctor if she has and post if she has.
I find it frightening to think of how many cases really in Mexico. Very limited testing and I think no one really has a clue.I found this interestinghttps://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2…
"Thanks, Islawoman. Robert, good article. Thank you."
"Good article, Robert.Falls right into what's been happening here at the hospitals. They had daily protests because there isn't enough personal protection equipment for the medical staff. Add that to not enough meds and medical equipment and you have a recipe for disaster."
He tested negative. YEA!!!!!
"Great news, Islawoman!!!!"
That’s great news! Yay indeed.
