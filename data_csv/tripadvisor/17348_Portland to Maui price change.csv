"The Hawaiian Airlines Internet Advertising Gnomes are at it again. Pretty much the same deal being advertised from Seattle. I know that the recession is, overall, a Bad Thing. That said, one positive effect is a tremendous uptick in my ability to feed my Maui addiction."

"Wish I could figure out how to use all these great prices to get back to the mainland!! Not good for codeshare partners and I need to get further than Phoenix or Vegas!! Oh well!! Book that flight and then find a place to stay. There will always be something available!! We miss you too, mrsomindy!!"
"""Just got a new message in that R/T is $288. You almost could book and later find housing!""Good price, but Hawaiian had a PDX-OGG sale the first 2 weeks of August that was as low as $264 RT. I know because I jumped on it ^^"
Hee-hee. Silly me. I read your thread title and thought you meant MAINE!
We are jumping on it for our usual Anniversary party.Talk about itching for sand...going straight to a snorkeling place!min
Somebody needs to take advantage. Please say a small prayer for those of us left behind as you drink your first mai tai.
