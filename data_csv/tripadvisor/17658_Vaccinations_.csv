My husband and I may be visiting Kuwait for several months and I have a question about vaccinations. I am pregnant and cannot receive many that are recommended before travel to the area. Is it ok to travel without vaccinations? Are there any major medical outbreaks in the area right now that would cause me to absolutely need to get these vaccinations? Thank you! 
Panic not there are no epidemics. All the vaccinations are recommended but the area is a lot cleaner and is disease free. Only thing I have seen in 8 months is the common cold and a few kids with chicken pox!
