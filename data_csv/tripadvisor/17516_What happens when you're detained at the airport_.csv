"Sorry for yet another flu post. I'm not as concerned about actually catching the flu, but it's my understanding that people returning from Mexico are being screened for flu like symptoms. What happens when you're denied boarding for flu like symptoms? Do you go to the hospital? Do you go somewhere else for quarantine? Will you lose the money for your airfare or are airlines working with passengers? How long until you can fly again? Who decides when you can fly again?I am really looking forward to our trip (May 7-12), but may end up cancelling due to these concerns."
You ask for another margarita and a taxi BACK to your hotel!
"I just returned from Cancun last night.At the Cancun airport, we were given a paper questionaire that basically asked if we had any flu-like symptoms. As long as you checked 'no' for each, you were fine. If you checked 'yes' for any of the symptoms, they asked you to postpone your trip and go see a local doctor. I noticed quite a few people that were coughing in the CUN airport, but we kept our distance.Once we reached Canada, we were verbally asked if we had any symptoms or if we had been around any sick people. Answer truthfully and you'll be fine. No problems or delays were experienced.I recommend taking vitamin C tablets with you. I took Emergen-C (1000 mg) before the flight and was fine."
Thanks for the info. That actually makes me feel a little better. Do you know if the form at the Cancun airport was just for Canadians (i.e. from your airline?) or was everyone filling it out? Not sure if the airlines are using the form or if the airport/ govt. is responsible.
I remember travelling to Toronto during the bird flu scare and having to fill out the same type of form. This is all well and good as long as people answer the questions truthfully
No one has answered the question yet as to what happens if your detained at the airport? What happens from there are you taken to a hospital? Are you to go back to your hotel and hope for a vacancy? Does anyone have a factual answer to this post?
"Dont worry, the US media has blown it out of proportions.....lol"
I thought they said they take you to a local doctor right?
"The quesionaire was for everyone leaving the Cancun airport, and it was handed out as we entered the terminal prior to check-in. We flew with Delta with an outbound flight to SLC, before heading to Vancouver. In SLC, we were quickly escorted through security and were not asked any questions.I did not see anyone being detained at the Cancun airport, but I assume they would have told you to visit a local doctor or hospital if you had any of the symptoms listed on the questionaire. On the local Mexican news, it indicated that the Mexican government had passed legislature to essentially detain anyone without any legal repercussions. However, there was no physical screening at the airport."
OK so admittedly we have people all geared up ready to take their Tamiflu and head off to paradise.Just noticing some downsides to taking Tamiflu include the possible side effects which MAY include:nausea vomiting diarrhea bronchitis stomach pain dizziness headacheAren't these almost the same as symptoms for H1N1???The same symptoms they are screening/watching for at the airport?????
"TaraFlu,You really need to stop with your goal of at least 50 negative postâ€™s a day. YOU are becoming an epidemic.Your trip has been cancelled; you are not coming so please, GO AWAY! "
"tarabull,You are right the symptoms are the same because the majority of all viral vaccines are made up of a small amount of the virus. This allows you body to create an immunity to it without the body going into overload and shutdown."
