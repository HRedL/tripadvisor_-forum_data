"I have to recommend that you avoid the Casa Alba holiday home rental from Nerja Villas Direct (www.nerjavillasdirect.co.uk) or any other offering from this family / company. We reserved the villa from them using Spain-Holiday.com for the Easter Holiday 2020. Full payment was required 3 months out, so we sent the final payment in January 2020. Fast forward a couple months, and the world is in the grips of a coronavirus pandemic. Spain has restricted all people to their homes (police enforced), borders are closed, flights are cancelled (ours were too) - resulting in no ability to take a holiday at this time or even legally reach the holiday rental property. I tried to be very reasonable with the property owner, requesting even partial credit toward rebooking our stay for a time when travel is once again possible. They have rejected all requests and will keep my payment, blaming me for not having travel insurance. While that would have been convenient to have had insurance, the primary purpose of travel insurance isn't to protect from force majeure situations but for personal situations. I think nuclear war could have broken out though and this family still would keep my money and offer no flexibility. I just wanted to make others aware and recommend avoiding this rental home. They do not offer the ability to leave reviews on their site or on their Spain-Holiday listing, so this is my only way to get the word out. I found another negative review for them in these forums as well if you search ""Casa Alba"". Beware!"
"How did you pay Brandon? Is there any refund from your credit card or Paypal?Whilst i feel for you, Travel Insurance is a must surely? Two out of my 3 cancellations so far have only had to send the receipt and evidence of the payment leaving their card/bank account or paypal account for their travel insurer to accept the claim. The other didnt have insurance and were booked for 4 weeks from last weekend. They didnt get there and have asked if i would offer them 2 weeks next year as a replacement/compensation. I agreed to this request. However may come to regret it later as i too may not be able to meet mortgage payments in the Uk and/or in Spain depending how long this goes on and how deep it hits at home.Its easy to blame the owners, but none of us know their circumstances.Travel insurance is a must in my view."
"They only accepted payment by bank transfer.I had trouble finding travel insurance because I am an expat in Europe from the USA. It seems most insurance companies require you to be a EU citizen.It's nice to see that you showed some flexibility toward your renter that did not have insurance. You demonstrated compassion during a global catastrophe. That's all I was looking for in my situation as well.Over the couple months I was in touch with the owners, they had multiple exotic holidays which leads one to believe they are not short on money. This was a decision to show no flexibility."
"I'm sorry you've lost your money and you don't need me to point out that paying by bank transfer was a big no-no. The lack of travel insurance (despite your reasons) was a double no-no. The owners could have shown some flexibility but do not have to by law and obviously don't intend to show any compassion but, again, they're not in the wrong I'm afraid."
Your circumstances probably make it even harder to get travel insurance too Brandon. I believe (in eu) you have to be in your home country to purchase cover too. Probably similar in US as at first i thought why didnt Brandon buy a US policy.
"I thought the name sounded familiar, sadly you are not the first to have a bad experience with Nerja Villas Direct…https:/…95437777"
Who’s Brandon?
Brandon&E perhaps?
I dont know where Brandon came from lol.
"That isn’t pleasant reading at all, hit them on social media and make sure a big audience sees them for what they are. Leave them a suitable trustpilot review, google and so on. The entire globe is in this pickle and everyone is shouldering less income. Their behaviour is disgraceful. Please share it far and wide."
We are all in it together Eh?! a pretty low way to act with everything that is happening..No good now but please in the future dont pay by bank transfer. Maybe a small deposit if you have to but never thr full wack
I took out travel insurance last year when booking my holiday and insure and go have informed me I am not covered because one of the exclusions for cancellation is no cover if government bans travel to an area. There are going to be thousands that will be left high and dry. So insurance doesn’t cover this situation.
"jdoyle I'd query that because the government didn't say you couldn't go when you booked the holiday, which you wouldn't have done if the government advice had been in force then. You could speak to the ombudsman if the insurers persist in refusing to pay out."
That conflicts with my friends Insure & Go policy. They have been assured their May holiday accommodation cancellation is covered on their claim (booked separately).
"I’m sorry you’ve lost both your holiday and your money but...My travel insurance provider (and I’ve used several over the years) has never asked about nationality/citizenship etc. The only reason I can see that it might matter is in the event of repatriation. My insurance also, until this situation arose in the past few weeks, covers pandemics and cancellation as a result of Government advice not to travel. The t&c have recently changed, but for my recent trip remained as they were when I booked, so had I needed to claim for the curtailment or cancellation of my trip (booked a few months ago) I would have been reimbursed. The business you dealt with isn’t to blame for you having to cancel, but I’m afraid you are to blame for not having insurance. Yes, it would be nice if they refunded you, but as has been said, many businesses will go under and if their t&c (which you agreed to) state there are no refunds they’re only going what you signed up to. Sadly, paying by bank transfer is rarely a good idea even when there isn’t a pandemic or other reason to cancel and travel insurance is essential for reasons too numerous to mention. Finally, always take out insurance the moment you book anything that isn’t refundable."
"Most T&C with travel insurance require you to be resident in the country where you are buying the insurance from. So as a British national Spanish resident if you buy a policy from a u.k firm then you arent covered.unless of course its a company that specialise in ""expat""insurance. You have to buy a policy from a""spanish""companyEdited: 7:20 am, March 24, 2020 "
"Update from Insure & Go today from their FAQ`s:I bought my policy before 12th March 2020.Q: I also booked my trip before you classed the outbreak as a ‘Known Event’ on 13th March 2020. So am I covered for Coronavirus (COVID-19)?A: It will be easier if we break this question down.If you are due to travel in the next 30 days (from 17th March to 15th April 2020):The FCO has advised against all but essential international travel for all British nationals for the next 30 days. Therefore, if you purchased your policy and booked your trip before 13th March 2020, and you are due to travel in the next 30 days, we will consider a claim for cancellation should you now decide to cancel your trip. Please note that if you decide to travel against the FCO’s advice, you will not be covered for any subsequent claim.If you travelled between 13th and 16th March and are currently abroad:If you purchased your policy before 12th March and booked your trip before 13th March 2020, then as per FCO advice, there is no need for you to come home immediately. However, we would encourage you to be mindful of the risk of delays and short notice cancellations to your travel arrangements, and to plan accordingly. We will consider claims for curtailment, should you decide to cut your trip short.Q: I bought my policy before 12th March 2020, but didn’t book my holiday until on or after 13th March 2020. Am I covered for Coronavirus (COVID-19)?A: Unfortunately, you would not be covered for any Coronavirus (COVID-19) related claims for that trip, because it was booked after we declared the outbreak a ‘Known Event’ on 13th March 2020. If you are due to travel in the next 30 days (between 17th March and 15th April 2020), you will not be covered for any cancellation claim should you decide to cancel your trip in light of the FCO’s advice for British nationals. I bought my policy on 12th March 2020.Q: I bought my policy on 12th March 2020 (i.e. before you classed the outbreak as a ‘Known Event’). Am I covered for Coronavirus (COVID-19)?A: Unfortunately, you would not be covered for any Coronavirus (COVID-19) related claims because you purchased the policy after we excluded cover at 23:59 on 11th March 2020. I bought my policy on or after 13th March 2020.Q: Am I covered for Coronavirus (COVID-19)?A: Unfortunately, you will not be covered for any Coronavirus (COVID-19) related claims for any trips that you now book, because you purchased your policy after we declared the outbreak a ‘Known Event’ on 13th March 2020."
"I appreciate all the comments and feedback from everyone who took the time to write a message in this thread. I still stand behind my original comment. I am well aware that the owner has no legal obligation to help me. Otherwise, I would have pursued a legal solution already. I'm also not legally required to help you if I pass you choking on the street. But wouldn't it be the compassionate thing to do during a time of extreme stress for someone? We should look out for each other as fellow humans (with insurance or not). In my specific situation, I was even open to a partial credit toward a future booking, allowing the owner to keep my money now and only allow me a partial benefit from my payment later. That was met with a firm NO. It doesn't sit well with me that someone can hide behind their Terms & Conditions and comfortably keep several thousand Euros of my money for a service I can no longer receive through no fault of my own. I know they are legally able to do this, but they are the ones that have to be comfortable with their own conscience when they go to sleep at night. I hope everyone here is managing well through this tough time (travelers and owners alike). I appreciate the discussion!"
Well said B&E. this isnt a company just a couple etc with enough money to own at least two big properties in nerja that they rent out (as said on their website). They arent an agent etc. Yet arent even prepaired to help in anyway. Says it all.
"They probably have no conscience and it wont bother them, not to even let you change to a later date is very unhelpful hopefully people will avoid their properties in the future."
"Awful business practice and thank you for sharing. The one good thing about Booking.com is you don't have to pay until closer to the date. Capistrano Village we pay them when we arrive. We've booked for middle May, which seems still highly unlikely but once Ryanair cancel the flight, we will then cancel with Booking.com .We did the same for a trip to Torquay 10 days ago."
"Their website shows Casa Alba available from April 9th. If these were your dates not only have they kept your money, they seem to be trying to rent it again."
I insured with insureandgo.ie and in the booklet under general exclusions it states Your travel to a country or specific area or Event to which the Travel Advice Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs or World Health Organisation have advised the public not to travel. Is not covered
Could you post the link to faqs with insure and go. I have searched the Irish site and they have no such information
Just looked up the policy booklet for Insureandg.uk and the wording is different to the Irish site. It would seem Irish customers have different terms and conditions
