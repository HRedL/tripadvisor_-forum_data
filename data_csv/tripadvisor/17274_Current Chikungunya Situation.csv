"Hello, My family is going on a trip this July to Moorea and Bora Bora, French Polynesia. I am aware of the previous Chikungunya situation in the islands and am wondering how worried we should be. As of late March, the outbreak was declared over, but how likely is it to still get the virus? None of us are in the risk group (over 65, have other illnesses, etc.), and we are staying in an Overwater Bungalow for the most of the trip. Also, on Bora Bora, are there more mosquitos on the surrounding motus or on the mainland (or is it about the same)? If Chikungunya is still a huge problem, what would you advise to prevent the likelihood of getting the virus? Thank you for your advise."
I just returned from Moorea and BB. I was there 3/20-3/31. We stayed at the Hiltons. We were on a Motu on BB. To be honest…we didn't see one mosquito the whole time were there. We chose not to go hiking in Moorea and stayed close to the water. Never used any bug spray either..but you could always put it on to be safe. Enjoy your trip!
"We just returned from 2 different resorts in Bora Bora and we stayed in an OWB at both. We burned a citronella candle on our deck when we were sitting outside and every time we went ashore we applied DEET. We talked to many of the staff and almost everyone of them had had Chikungunya, but they all said they didn't know of anyone having it in the last month or more. I'd recommend taking precautions (DEET, etc.) and you should be fine. Enjoy paradise!"
"This is the information I received last week  Tahiti Tourisme would like to provide the latest update regarding the Chikungunya virus. The French Polynesia Presidency released a statement declaring the end of Chikungunya epidemic. The following is an English translation of the official announcement from the Council of Ministers on March 18, 2015. To view the original document please click here. “The Chikungunya epidemic that hit the islands of French Polynesia in October 2014 has ended. In the last three weeks, the number of new cases has diminished to less than 5 people per 10,000. However, the virus is still present in French Polynesia. The Austral and Marquesas Islands are still experiencing cases of the virus, however the numbers are very low and rapidly decreasing. The Department of Health agrees that personal protective measures against mosquitoes and the fight against the virus are still needed and should be continued, to prevent the occurrence of new epidemics carried by mosquitoes (e.g. especially dengue). Everyone, including managers of public places, must continue to remove Mosquito deposits and habitats each week. Thanks to the efforts of all health professionals in the public and private sectors the epidemic was overcome without resorting to exceptional measures or external reinforcement. After the initial phase of the disease, many patients experience a persistence or recurrence of painful symptoms. This phenomenon is known to occur in about half of those affected, and in some cases, medical treatment is necessary. In case of reoccurrence of pain with fever, people should consult their healthcare professional. Health professionals are aware of the post-epidemic phase that will generate a request of support for persistent and chronic forms of Chikungunya. A summary of recommendations for good practice in this regard has been circulated to all the professionals involved. Surveys will be conducted with a sample of people to evaluate these chronic forms.”As mentioned by the poster above use pre caution and be diligent about applying mosquito repellent.Regards BO"
Thanks. We are also staying at both Hilton resorts. Do you know if the water at the resort (tap water) is safe to drink?
"We have stayed at the Hilton on Moorea and return in June. Don't drink the tap water, use the bottled water."
"I would add that the same tourism board that is now declaring the epidemic ""over"" was completely silent at the peak of the outbreak. I personally would seek out other sources than the travel agents who post here and tourism boards.I was not in any risk group and have had the virus for three months which has greatly impacted my quality of life. I wish I had known then what I know now, as they say. I was diligent about repellant and had only two bites that I can pinpoint. OWBs are no precaution. My son also got it and he was only with us the week we stayed in an OWB at the FS.Edited: 5 years ago "
"It's so difficult to know ""the"" answer for your own situation. We did think long and hard about our March trip, but eventually decided to go because the number of new cases appeared to be trending downward rather than upward. We made sure to book overwater bungalows (because on previous trips, we've sometimes had land-based ones that were mosquito magnets) and we used Deet-based products liberally.I did find it concerning that Chikungunya was never mentioned to us other than by our travel agent (and, obviously, what we learned here and in doing our own research). It was not mentioned on the international flight, nor at Faaa. It was not mentioned at hotel check-in. The only time bug spray was even mentioned was when we booked a 4x4 excursion for Tahiti. I do believe that the infection levels have dropped very significantly from the December/January period, but I also believe that the chances of infection are not zero and, as SheaG knows firsthand, the consequences of infection are not minor. That being said, we saw no mosquitos on Bora Bora. We used Deet whenever we were on land, along with various other products (particularly when walking on the mainland), but we were bite-free our entire five night stay at the Thalasso. We spent quite a bit of time at Le Moana and we even walked by the ocean side of the Thalasso multiple times and were fine. When we moved to Le Tahaa... things changed. The resort proper was visibly full of mosquitos: in the lobby, the spa, the treehouse restaurant. The resort didn't mention Chikungunya (or dengue fever for that matter), but on the second day of our stay started putting two aerosol bottles of Off out at breakfast. Despite our best efforts, we were covered in mosquito bites. My son, being a 14 year old boy, counted his and came up with 40. It has been 2 weeks since we left Tahaa so I believe we didn't get Chikungunya, but if I had plans to return to French Polynesia in the next 6 months (sadly, we only go once a year), I would absolutely return but would definitely pay more attention to the individual mosquito conditions at the resorts I was choosing.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Hi all,Below is the link to an official release by the Presidency of French Polynesia - Council of Ministers and a google translate below it. This release was issued on March 18, 2015.…presidence.pf/index.php/…End of the chikungunya epidemicThe chikungunya epidemic that hit all the islands of French Polynesia since the month of October 2014 is now complete. For three weeks, the number of new cases of observed patients is less than 5 persons per 10 000. This criterion is accepted as the threshold end of epidemic.However, the virus is still present in French Polynesia. The Austral Islands and the Marquesas Islands, if the epidemic approaches its end, people are still affected, but the number is now very low and rapidly decreasing.The Department of Health said that the personal protective measures against mosquitoes and the fight against houses are still needed and should be continued, in particular to avoid the occurrence of new epidemics carried by mosquitoes (eg especially dengue).Everyone must continue to remove deposits every week. The managers of public places, friendly gathering or the public should continue to organize periodically the dégîtage.Thanks to the efforts of all health professionals in the public and private sectors and in public, at all points of French Polynesia, the epidemic was reached without resorting to exceptional measures or external reinforcement.After the initial phase of the disease, many patients experience a persistence or recurrence of painful symptoms. This phenomenon is known and occurs in about half of those affected, and in some cases, medical treatment will be necessary. In case of occurrence of pain with fever again, people should not hesitate to consult their doctor.Health professionals are aware of the post-epidemic phase that will generate a request for support for persistent and chronic forms of chikungunya for several months. A summary of recommendations for good practice in this regard has been circulated to all the professionals involved. Surveys will be conducted with a sample of people to evaluate these chronic forms.During the second quarter, a broad awareness on arbo viruses and their impact will be implemented by means of a traveling exhibition and public debate.sunny regards,shully"
"We went in mid March to April 1, we stayed at pensions on Rangiroa and Fakarava. WE took plenty of DEET products, and we used them. The people there knew why, and mentioned it. Most everyone local had already had it. We got bit about 10 or so times over 17 nights. We did not get it. We were most worried about other tourists who did not use spray and had tons of visible bite marks, and then those mosquitoes getting us. But, with vigilant use we were fine and it seems it's run the course in most parts of FP. However, we still use protection because I don't particularly want dengue either. I was really really really surprised at the amount of other tourists who use nothing. It was particularly noticeable with some people on our dive boat, bites all over, no protection. But some think protection is poison and won't use it. We prefer to use it. But to each their own I guess.We spent our last day in Papeete and honestly were more concerned there, more tourist, more population in general. But we were fine. Unfortunately, one of our favorite pension persons did get it and did get the recurring symptoms part. I feel bad for him. But he knew exactly why we were using so much spray and wipes. I would not hesitate, and won't hesitate, to go again next year and take our same precautions that we always take."
"la Orana,We just returned from Bora Bora. We stayed at the Intercontinental Le Moana and the Four Seasons over a 10 day period April 4th-13th. The bathroom in our beach bungalow at the Le Moana did not have any screens in the window openings and so we requested a mosquito net for our bed. They installed it quickly and it gave us peace of mind for sleeping. The airport is another place to be extra careful as it is not airconditioned and there are lots of areas like the bathrooms with open window areas and no screens. We did wear mosquitoNO bands which are citronella based and non-toxic as well as use Deet wipes and sprays to be safe. Mornings and early evenings are the most vulnerable times of the day but mozzies can be out at any time. Just remember to apply over your suncream and reapply after swimming. Have a wonderful trip :)"
