"My friend and I have a trip to Rome planned the first week of April. Half the time spent in Rome, the other half in Venice. With the Coronavirus spreading like wildfire over there (last Monday the count of infected was 150, this Monday it is now at 1,694), we are concerned about traveling there. Although the major outbreaks are around Lombardy, at the rate it's spreading we feel it is very unsafe to be in the country. Unfortunately the airlines and 2/3 of the hotels are not accommodating cancellations. We understand they have policies in place, but this is a global health concern. And we're not even asking for a refund, they can keep our money, we'd just like to reschedule at the very least to come on a later date once things are safe again. Does anyone have any knowledge and/or advice regarding any possible steps we can take? We'll be out over $1,500 each, so we're desperate at this point.Thanks in advance!"
If the hotels aren't allowing refunds or date changes there's not a lot you can do. Perhaps check your travel insurance?
"Start by talking to your travel insurance company..... that’s what I did for travel to Australia in late March, currently I’m still travelling. It seems that virus is now present in 12 US States so far, so by April it may be a case of from the frying pan in to the fire to travel. Right now all you can do is cancel and take the hit .....or wait..... I’m waiting"
"Because everybody's situation is different, and the current situation is not exactly normal or commonplace, there are no standard procedures for how to handle this - whether you are the traveller no longer wishing to travel or the hotel that nobody wishes to stay in any more, and loosing money.All you can do is contact the airlines, the hotels and the sources of anything else you have booked and politely ask them to consider a postponement. Some may agree, some may not.Otherwise, if you have travel insurance, then check the policy. Few are providing cover for this situation, but there are policies which may refund money.SWT"
"There are currently 4 current cases in the Lazio region of Italy. 3 in hospital and 1 on home isolation(Venice is higher)It is maybe worth keeping an eye by region rather than by countryhttp://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/documents/20182/1221364/Dati+Riepilogo+Nazionale+2marzo2020/f750bdea-4e89-4747-8d05-72ede9f40f05Edited: 1:09 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"To add to SWT “....then check the policy.” I did, “Few are providing cover for this....” some are. My UK insurer has said “if UK government says do not fly then we refund anything the airline doesn’t” when asked about consequential costs such as pre paid hotels “ we will refund that” . When asked what happens if flights are cancelled or curtailed whilst you are away “we will support you and get you home” .As I said, check your insurance, but if course the sting in the tail is that if you are not insured already than you will not be able to arrange cover now."
"If you can't cancel and get a refund, all you can do at this point is to keep watching your flights. I always hesitate to book non-refundable lodgings just because things sometimes happen."
"Pointless to ask for accommodation if you cannot live with the answer. The hotels and the airlines cannot refund the monies as the hotels and the airlines don't have any money to refund. The industry as a whole is collapsing. Neither the hotels nor the airlines will make future accommodations as such accommodations will be liabilities. Not a lot of people purchase travel insurance so don't feel bad about not purchasing travel insurance. It seems to be a UK thing and I think one of the requirement is to go on public forums and berate people that didn't purchase travel insurance...Edited: 4:00 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"I don't see anyone berating anyone on this thread for ""not purchasing travel insurance."""
.”It seems to be a UK thing and I think one of the requirement is to go on public forums and berate people that didn't purchase travel insurance...”Or...... it seems to be a UK thing to recognise that s**t happens and take steps to mitigate it.
"Without travel insurance... how would you pay for medical treatment if you fall ill abroad, or for a chartered jet to take you home in a worst-case scenario?"
"Travel insurance may not be the answer. I purchased Allianz insurance for a flight to Europe. I just read the fine print. Surprise, cancellation due to an epidemic is not covered."
"You’ve decided to panic and cancel. No one is going to give you your money back. So you’re going to have to eat the cost of that decision. I still go, because I don’t know where you live but chances are it’s on its way to your hometown any day now"
"OP, reread your sentence “ at the rate it's spreading we feel it is very unsafe to be in the country. ” that might soon be the case wherever you live. The fact is that compared to population size the number of cases is still Infinitesimally small. People are still travelling, still going to school and work etc. If you trust your government be guided by their travel advisories."
"It would be useful if you'd put a location in your profile. As well, rather than make other forum members guess it would be handy to know the airline with which you've booked along with the ticket type you've bought. Presumably the latter is to travel in Economy, but if the tickets are Basic Economy that's another matter.'Unfortunately the airlines and 2/3 of the hotels are not accommodating cancellations. We understand they have policies in place, but this is a global health concern. And we're not even asking for a refund, they can keep our money, we'd just like to reschedule at the very least to come on a later date once things are safe again.'It seems that you're willing to rebook rather than cancel entirely and as such the carrier may rightfully be refusing to give a refund for nonrefundable tickets.Again depending on the ticket type you and your friend have bought - ideally from the carrier, not from a third party - you should be able to amend the travel date for a change fee and fare difference. You may be able to do this at the airline's Manage My Booking page, but without knowing the airline that's a guess. If you can't do that at MMB then call the airline and ask about rebooking rather than cancellation.As to whether the hotels will let you rebook that depends on their terms and conditions."
"#11 i too purchased allianz and they wont cover to cancel or change to italy. However, if the government advises it is extreme risk they wont cover as it is excluded under government intervention. Basically the fine print means they have lots of ways to get out of paying the insurance. We stand to lose in excess of $10000 for flights, accommodation, tours. rock and a hard place."
"""we feel it is very unsafe to be in the country.""I can understand that argument. At the end it is a personal decision.""We'll be out over $1,500 each, so we're desperate at this point.""At the end of the day you have to take a simple decision. Do you personally judge the risk being too high. If you answer yes, then the financial damage - which most likely you will suffer and nobody else will cover - should not be an argument.If it is, then just put a price tag on your decision.It will not be helping you a lot, but many people and businesses suffer from this outbreak financially. So you are not alone."

The first half of it is positively bizarre.
"I appreciate the kind, informative responses from most of you, however I’m not sure why so many people on these forums are so quick to be rude when others are just trying to get helpful advice. I live in the United States, our president has advised against travel to Italy and are subject to quarantine once arriving back to the states. The number of cases has risen to 3,089 now. They have shut down all schools and universities now as well. Trust me, I’d still go if it made sense. I’m 25, not concerned about getting sick, however, how does it make sense to go on a vacation that’s on lockdown in numerous areas, continuing to rise and spread. Guess all we can do at this point is wait and see if the outbreak continues to rise in Rome, sadly that’s our only hope for rescheduling."
"I think all you can do is contact hotels and airline Ed again but you can make them offer a refund. The CDC and the state department (not the president) says don’t go to Italy so I would not go. In the USA those are the official government sources. With the airline the now official travel advisories should give you some ammunition, although I’m not sure it’ll help with a local hotel."
"It would be very helpful if you post which airline you are travelling with, then we can provide much better responses. Unfortunately for hotels, most will charge at last one night if you cancel."
"Virgin Atlantic to London, British Airways to Rome."
"We, too, have a trip booked to Europe next month (Barcelona), and since we are seniors we are quite concerned about the CoViD-19 situation. We have Allianz travel insurance which, as was mentioned earlier, doesn’t pay in cases of epidemics. Argh!The OP says they will be out $1500 each if they cancel the trip and can’t get a refund. I look at this from a different direction. The money is spent and gone. They will be out $1500 each whether they go or not. And if they go, they will spend plenty of money in Italy. So by not going, they will save plenty. Even in bad situations there is bright side.Edited: 4:35 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I'm not trying to be a smart-alec here, but all those whose insurance isn't covering their cancellations, can I ask when you took out the insurance?Just asking because our own insurance company sent us an email saying that the covid-19 isn't covered on any policies after January 25th (I think- or thereabouts.) We're covered, but are the posters after that date?"
"“Virgin Atlantic to London, British Airways to Rome.”============Thank you. In these cases the ticket is issued by the long haul carrier, in this case Virgin Atlantic (VS). So you’ll be subject to the VS travel waiver policy. Here it is (link below) on their website, and you’ll see that VS refers to “VS issued tickets“ so they should apply in your case. Look at the waivers and if they apply to your itineraries contact either VS or (if you booked with one) your travel agent and ask for the waiver. https:/…Coronavirus.htmlGood luck."
"As TravellerPlus said, you can just try and negotiate a reschedule. It must be a terrible time for hotels in Italy so I can understand why they may insist on strict enforcement of terms and conditions so that they can maintain some short-term cash flow needed to stay in business when fewer people are booking stays. If you plan to reschedule the choice of dates may be essential for success. Simply postponing by one year to first week of April in 2021 may not be realistic just because airlines won't be able to take bookings that far out. In 2021 that is also the Easter week which I believe to be a peak travel period in Rome while in 2020 you would have been traveling a week before Easter. It is painful to pay $1500 per person and not to travel, but if you choose to travel now you risk being put in quarantine for 14 days just because somebody in your hotel tested positive for covid-19. In the best case you just miss all the sightseeing in Italy but you also could miss work for two weeks which for many people would be a much bigger financial hit than $1500 that has already been paid for."
"Centralvic,Types of travel insurance differ between countries so you cannot compare Australian products with those from other countries."
Personally I think now is the perfect time to travel to Rome and Venice in terms of tourist numbers. Both Rome and Venice are normally so crowded that everywhere you go you'll be on your toes trying to look over the heads of hundreds of people all holding selfie sticks to try and get a photo of a fountain or a statue and every museum or attraction has an endless line. It's extremely stressful and difficult to enjoy. I know that Venice is completely empty these days and you'd pretty much have it all to yourself. I imagine Rome much less crowded. But check first and make sure places you want to visit are even open. Ultimately you'll have to decide if it's worth the risk to you. You should also check whether or not quarantine requirements are in place for persons returning from Italy. Also be aware that once you've been to Italy you may not be allowed into other countries who have travel bans in place.
"PerfectlyPerth- when you consider the lousy Aussie dollar compared to other places, AND how long we have to travel to get to some places, I'm sure most of us down here get travel insurance to cover our losses if anything goes wrong, At least, I HOPE most of get it.....Heck, you'd often pay as much as other countries' people do for a holiday just to get over to Melbourne, sometimes.Edited: 6:23 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"*can't re-edit*I'm talking about you getting to Melbourne, not overseas people!"
"#80, I bought my Allianz policy in May 2019 for my March 2020 trip. Mostly to use as health insurance in case anything happens abroad. All individually bought Allianz policies in the US exclude epidemics no matter when we bought themEdited: 8:58 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"PerfectlyPerth, I had a stupid moment and only read your user name. Sorry! I was assuming you were in Perth.I shouldn't jump on before I wake up properly. :(To Mster9- it seems Alliance has a different policy entirely to ours. No wonder posters aren't happy with them.Edited: 9:56 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Centralvic,How about a few facts from the Allianz PDS:""GENERAL EXCLUSIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL SECTIONSWe will not pay under any circumstances if:A.14] Your claim arises from, is related to or associated with: • an actual or likely epidemic or pandemic; or • the threat of an epidemic or pandemic.
