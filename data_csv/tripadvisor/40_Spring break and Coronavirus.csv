"From what read, Mexico surprisingly only has 6 confirmed cases. Gotta believe that will change soon. Especially around the ""spring break"" destinations."
Really no impact SB wise in Zihua that I can see.Last week the Las Brisas was Hoppin when we got there (2/26) and was about regular throughout the week.Keith
"Well with the lag time between exposure and symptoms, I'm guessing it will be early April and beyond before there is a noticeable affect there."
"Ben I agree, post semana Santa where many people travel to the coast from Mexico City and inland, will surely bring the numbers up sharply by late April/May. Sadly the best thing to do is not travel unless it’s essential. Best to avoid crowds, stay home from work etc. But who wants to follow that sound advice ?? Not many, mainly because of money (and a wee bit of selfishness). Also the numbers are still relatively low in Mexico, I think people are willing to risk it rather than lose thousands of dollars and the heartbreak of cancelling a much anticipated and needed vacation. Sad but true."
But keep in mind who Mexico might or might not be prepared. Being in a hospital in Mexico can be shocking!!
"Or in the case of Covid-19, deadly."
"""Also the numbers are still relatively low in Mexico, I think people are willing to risk it rather than lose thousands of dollars and the heartbreak of cancelling a much anticipated and needed vacation. Sad but true.""The numbers are low for now because it's a large country that doesn't get a lot of tourists from China, Iran, Italy- but it will get there too. No one 'needs' a vacation. Easy for me to say as we just got back from two wonderful weeks in Negril, lol, but let's face it- travel for pleasure is not a true 'necessity'. If I had a trip planned anywhere in the world right now, I'd cancel. Not that I am afraid of getting it, but I wouldn't want the hassle of possible delayed or cancelled flights or traveling through germy airports and on planes, or possibly dealing with quarantine on my return. Ask an Italian how fast things can change in a mere two week period. Or look at the numbers in Costa Rica directly south of Mexico- a much smaller country, granted, but the numbers there went from 1 case to 22 in less than a few days and predicted to be 150 before long."
I just booked fall-winter @80% off. It is not the plague. I won't live my life in a bubble. To each their own.
"Don't kid yourself, the numbers in Mexico are low because of the lack of detection in addition to reporting."
Anyone in Zihua now? Does it seem like business as usual in the town? Trying to decide go/no go for 03/21?
"Joanne- I would cancel. ""I just booked fall-winter @80% off. It is not the plague. I won't live my life in a bubble. To each their own.""Well, lol, it might be over by then. I wouldn't hesitate to book for next fall or winter either. I sure wouldn't go anywhere now. A co-worker left for a vacation in Ecuador today. Clueless. Hope they enjoy their quarantine when they return home."
"With Delta stopping flying to Eurpoe (already been stopped FROM Europe) and asking for a bail out now...we are in serious trouble. My friend is supposed to be going on a RCCL cruise...he can't go because he is 65 with a bad heart....so RCCL said no go...but he can rebook until Dec. 30, 2020...might be a different price...but a better trip.More airlines, hotels, and businesses will follow Delta especially after they see what Washington has to offer up. Hard to just stop flying. where do you put the planes...employees and booked passengers!"
Here now. Appears business as usual- no one is even talking about it. Guitar fest is winding up tomorrow and Carnaval has begun.
And no one is preparing for it when it hits? If that is the case...look out!! Dangerous situation then.

"At present time, there are only 16 reported cases in Mexico. The belief is that the low number is do to the lack of testing being done or even available there. The health officials there are now considering border crossing restrictions from the North. Going to be an interesting week or two ahead."
"If the airlines are going into freefall, I will be getting Dates for the fall set with the Girlfriend over drinks this evening (yes we are still braving the streets in Minnesota at this time) and watching the prices!!Keith"
"For the average mexicano, preparing never happens.People will deal with it. Price of garlic may go up."
Just got home today from Zihua.Everything was about the same as usual.The Carnival and El Zocolo were both going strong.
The calm before the storm.
"The Mexican public school vacation has been doubled and will begin March 20th through April 20th. I do not know what impact that will have on social distancing and Semana Santa crowding but it is travel information to be aware of. The cancha was SRO, jam packed, right out to the street and beyond this past Friday night for Carnaval and then a packed parade route yesterday.We all face hard choices in this strange time.The right to travel choice may soon be suspended so think hard about short term plans."
"What Juan said.The right to travel choice just got smaller.Prime Minister Selfie, who I despise, while he is in self isolation, found a pair. Closing the border, directing international flights to specific cities. He'll take heat for keeping the US out of the travel ban, but it's a gusty move.Now implementing these sweeping measures (I've only mentioned a couple) is gonna be a whole different sh88t showEdited: 2:20 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Figures are already being pointed (by the Zihua guru) at Canadian and American visitors for spreading the virus in Mexico. But instead, check this out.https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2…"
"It should read ""fingers"" of which mine are either too fast or too clumsy sometimes."
"I of course canceled a trip to Paris for May. And I often travel to Mexico and South America in the summer. I will not be traveling this summer. I speak the language and understand and love the culture, but unless you know someone very wealthy (and have a lot of money yourself) who can get you into a quality institution, I would not want to be quarantined nor hospitalized there. Be safe."
