"""Is there any chance we could see that happening in near future""Yes, it could be less than .1% and more than 99%. So now what?"
Just put in quotes.... why is that a big deal?
Nothing is impossible.But this is very unlikely to happen.
FWIW your use of quotation marks means--So called rumors. They are rumors so you do not use quote marks. A very common error. On a forum without access to bold and italic fonts you can use all CAPS for emphasis.

"Disneyland is closing thru end of March, so it is inching closer to casinos."
@zoobrew I was thinking the same..... not sure why everyone wants to focus on quotes here.... it was just a question asking for thoughts.... appreciate a normal response!
"do it now and reopen when my trip starts in april. that's all i ask, lol."
"""I was thinking the same..... not sure why everyone wants to focus on quotes here""Only one person here focused on your misuse of quote marks.

"Yea, I agree if these ""rumors"" about Dizzyland are true than anything is ""possible""Does anyone here have an good ""advise"" if this is going two happen or not ?"
"While I wouldn't place any faith in rumors, considering the continued acceleration of closures everywhere in the country, casinos closing is a very real possibility.I'd say by tomorrow seems unlikely though. Except that at the same time it gets crazier by the hour. I'd be more concerned about a domestic travel ban if I were you. Could make it chaos trying to get home. Be safe!"

"I was in Macau before all it's casinos' two weeks shut-down last month, and I do not blame them, because the gaming halls and hotels were nearly empty, and body temperature checks were at every entrance to each casino and restaurant. Annoying but I did not mind it (I also did not stick around for too long). Macau re-opended with new implementations, such as space between each players at the tables and no spectators allowed behind table players, and regular disinfecting the casinos - that may be the future for LV."
"No, he's talking about the ""rumors"" that some of the casinos are going to close down.He doesn't give a ""flip"" about Disneyland ""rumors""Edited: 5:39 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Unfortunately I think there is a good chance it happens.
Yes if their lawyers tell them to.

"Just returned from LV yesterday, all healthy but under self quarantine at home, will go to office only after 5PM when all coworkers are gone. If one person is covid19 confirmed, entire company shuts down. Learning from examples of China(2 months ago), Italy and even New York City, my feeling is everything will be closed. Assume the worst, already happened elsewhere. We are lucky, we are 2 months behind China, we already seen this movie, we know the script and how the stories will play out. Likewise, our suffering and damages will be 2 months shorter than China, 2-3 weeks shorter than Italy. Assume the worst from this point on, as CDC chief said yesterday, it will get worse, and worse, and worse. He said it 3 times.Look for casino stock bargains. I bought LVS Sands stock at $4.50 in November 2008, the talk at that time was Sands was running out of money. You can still gamble in casinos without being in Las Vegas."
It's no longer a matter of if but when.
"We had dinner at Black Bear Diner in Fresno yesterday on our way back from Las Vegas. As wholesaler. We had 5 cancelled and hold orders from retailers across the country today. Alaska retailer said all cruise ships stopped, no business, the other 4 are from across the country, East, West coast, Texas. So it begins.....,"
are there going to shut down for conovid 19?
"Short term pain is better than long term pain. If we shut down everything like Italy and China, we can get over covid19 in 2-3 weeks, if not, it will drag on for months. Businesses can survive 3 weeks of zero business, not 3 months of no business. Regardless what you or I think about covid19, real or not, fear is here, fear is real. Damage started, let’s get over it in a very decisive and draconian way."
"And when people come here from countries that don't shut down? Many in government want no travel restrictions and no border security so that won't work. I'm more concerned about the sheer filth from human excrement and used hypodermic needs that line the streets of our cities, not to mention thypus and typhoid. N1H1 was similar. Got through that just fine."

It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if this happens.
">>>If we shut down everything like Italy and China, we can get over covid19 in 2-3 weeks, if not, it will drag on for months.<<<40+ school districts in my state just closed done until April 24."

@sladethat is fantastic
"So rates are free, conventions are cancelling, tourists are staying away, restaurants closing, ...will casinos close? Perhaps, but may be working with Skelton crews ..no need to be fully staffed"
"""""I'm more concerned about the sheer filth from human excrement and used hypodermic needs that line the streets of our cities""There is a valid point here, not down playing Covid 19. Look at what happened in San Diego 2018-19 which is considered one of the cleanest cities in the US. We have a huge homeless problem. Around 20 people died and 592 people got infected with Hepatitis A. Many in the medical community believe the reason for the outbreak was based on the ban of disposable plastic bags. The homeless used the plastic bags as their place to go #2, When access to these bags stopped many months after the plastic bag ban, the outbreak started. That being said there is some validity to his comments, sandiegocounty.gov/.../dc/Hepatitis_A.htmlYou can google the plastic bag thing....Edited: 9:00 pm, March 12, 2020 "

“ but may be working with Skelton crews ”Red is long gone.
....yeah but are his cruise?
this is starting to resemble a conversation writers had for season 3 of the wire
"bridgefan was around for several bubonic plague outbreaks, and i'm really wondering why they haven't chimed in yet."
"“ this is starting to resemble a conversation writers had for season 3 of the wire”An apt comment, considering one of the season 3 episodes was titled “ Call it a Crisis of Leadership “."
"""Call it a crisis of leadership."" - Proposition Joe"
"“ bridgefan was around for several bubonic plague outbreaks, and i'm really wondering why they haven't chimed in yet.” Winner winner chicken dinner."
This isn’t just a couple weeks thing anymore. This will be a 2-3 month thing until everyone infected is quarantined and a cure is provided. The smaller cruise ship industry and discount airlines will hurt if not go bankrupt during this time. The world itself didn’t believe how bad it was and then let everything continue as normal for two more weeks.
Canadian oil speaks the truth
"Governor Sisolak just held a press conference in which he declared a state of emergency but said that as of now there are no plans to shut down the casinos. There is a panel of health professionals that is meeting to come up with emergency guidelines for things like how many people should gather together. The state gets its revenue from gaming and sales taxes, but he said there is enough in reserve to get through this crises. I'm going to Reno next week for among other things, a free slot tournament invite. I called the casino to ask about spacing of players and they said that indeed, players will be separated and not have to play next to each other, because of the virus. Perhaps I'm crazy, but the tourney pays a minimum number of places and the odds of placing go up as the number of contestants goes down. So I hope wiping down everything as I go, and trying to avoid touching my face will keep me from getting sick."
"It could in theory be shorter if we all collectively do our part. But we need 2 things to happen first. 1. Testing testing testing. This is a catastrophic failure. 2. A full on commitment straight to the very top. Ummm, to say that's not happening is an understatement. So yeah, barring a weather related postponement, I think 2-3 months is optimistic."
"#47,Will they add “sneeze guards” to the slots?Can one play in a full haz-mat suit, and gloves?Just curious,Hunt"
"No, but they'll be going nuts sanitizing the machines -- I think it wil be the first time in history they've actually sanitized the machines as opposed to wiping them down with a contaminated rag and spreading the germs from machine to machine. They say they'll have lots of sanitizing wipes available by the machines that people can use to wipe down surfaces before touching them. I'm not so worried about touching things as I am about breathing in other people's droplets. Perhaps I'll wear a mask, but as of now, I'm still planning on going. If it gets too scary over the weekend, perhaps I'll reconsider."
"""This will be a 2-3 month thing until everyone infected is quarantined and a cure is provided.""I wouldn't expect a cure anytime soon (or at all) and not till next year for a vaccine."
"“ Perhaps I'll wear a mask,”Which every medical expert in the world will tell you does nothing to prevent getting Coronavirus. People who already have the virus should wear a mask. To prevent spreading it to others."
"To slightly disagree with Irish, some people, wear the masks so as not to touch their face directly.."
"Unless the mask is covering their eyes, this isn’t very effective. And walking around with a mask covering your eyes as well as your nose and mouth really isn’t recommended."
It will be 2-3 years before we have this few cases again. A vaccine will take until 2021 to finalize and then many months to manufacture the 350 m dose just for this country and many more months to vaccinate the 350 m people. Then many more months to force the last 20% of the population to get the vaccine. Courts will be busy. Now you have the other billions of people on the planet. This all assumes that the vaccine is close to 100% effective and the virus doesn't mutate.
A mask is only effective at keeping out disease from your mouth and nose for so long. (And obviously useless for you eyes and ears) After 8 hours it could in fact make things quite worse.
"Came home yesterday from Las Vegas, 3 of us are perfectly healthy, but we voluntarily put ourselves into self quarantine. Came to office and left before 8AM before colleagues showed up. I came in at 6PM to work, in addition to work from home. I don’t enter other offices and not touching anything with bare hands. South Point was packed, everybody was healthy and happy, we were happy and healthy. I took elevators numerous times with others, I waited every morning at Seattle Best Coffee with 20-30 people for my coffee. I talked to 100s of people, I dined in buffet and restaurants, I dined with teams of salespeople, I walked through casino and corridors full of people many times everyday. All it takes is one virus carrier who may not know he or she is a carrier. Now that carrier could be me. If one person is a confirmed covid19, our entire company must shut down, plus responsibility to families and my community and my country. Very easy to self quarantine, no place like home. The hard part is knowing you are 100% healthy yet staying home. I am not afraid of what I know and see on TV, what I am afraid of is what I don’t know. If you don’t need to go anywhere, don’t go anywhere for 3 months."
"“ Came home yesterday from Las Vegas, 3 of us are perfectly healthy, but we voluntarily put ourselves into self quarantine.”How did you get home without being in close proximity to other people? I assume you drive yourself and didn’t stop anywhere along the way?"
"I find this “plague Dr” mask, very useful: https:/…Not only does it protect me, but all folk keep their distance.Good luck,Hunt"
Going to the office when nobody is around is not self quarantine. Every surface you breathed on is contaminated for many hours if not days.
"This perhaps isn't a direct analogy but..governors in New York, Ohio, California, Oregon and Ohio ( and likely other states by the time this is posted) have banned ""social gatherings"" involving more than 250 people.Nevada hasn't done this yet..all that resort conglomerate political power, etc. Just speculation, but I think they'll shut the casinos down ( at least partially because they literally couldn't afford to keep the lights on with very limited customer numbers, if the presented analogy indeed would apply; I don't know if it does or not). For how long? Anybody's guess..The gaming/ hospitality industry is actively lobbying the Feds for economic relief and have been for a few weeks since this all started. The National Association of Broadcasters ( and it's nearly 100,000 attendees) have canceled their scheduled spring Vegas convention ..which represents another huge revenue hit to the resorts and community.Next coronavirus - related thread?

"irishfan is correcti think a lot of people get confused about people who wear masks. people who are already sick are the ones who are asked to wear them, to limit their droplets from spewing all over the place. if by some miracle vegas doesn't shut down, and i can actually do my april trip, if i'm sick, i'll wear a mask on the plane. it's the least i can do for my fellow passengers."

"Short term pain is better than long term pain. Let us shut down everything like Italy and China, for 2 weeks.

"Tonight was my last night here in NY. Announced we are closing down until further notice. Not forced to yet, but we are a small densely packed place. Just not worth it right now."
"The advice not to wear a mask is predicated on the thought that the virus isn't prone to airborne transmission. But recent reports (including on the Johns Hopkins coronavirus website) say that it might very well hang in the air and be capable of infecting someone long after the contagious person is no longer present at the location. If indeed it can hang in the air, wearing an N-95 mask would stop airborne microbes from getting in your mouth and nose. I think the continued advice not to wear a mask unless you're sick is to try to keep people from hoarding masks so there will be enough for medical personnel. But of course, there won't be enough to go around because they're made in China, where production has stopped due to the virus.Mask or no mask, we're in a pretty bad place. Whether or not we go to casinos is not very important in the big picture. If you see someone wearing a mask who you don't think should be wearing one, don't say anything, as the stress level is high enough without strangers admonishing strangers."
"The N-95 mask does not protect ordinary people from the contracting the Coronavirus, and it is designed to worn by medical personnel to be disposed of minutes after use and not wear for hours on end. It is also completely false to suggest that only China makes N-95 masks, and China stopped making it due to the coronavirus. In fact, 3M and other manufactures make N-95s in the U.S. and production have ramped up in the U.S. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/02/3m…"

Wynn Sports Book and Poker Room is closing on Sunday until further notice.
Ohio and Illinois are closing all casinos. Assume everything will shut down soon. This really feels like massive overkill.
“ ·Wynn Sports Book and Poker Room is closing on Sunday until further notice.“Well...yeah. Why would they remain open with all the sporting events not taking place?
All full time table games supervisors and dealers are being placed on On Call/Layoff status effective March 16.
"""All full time table games supervisors and dealers are being placed on On Call/Layoff status effective March 16.""Where?And how long can the Las Vegas casinos hold out? They've got to cave soon."
This was posted at the Mirage. https:/…1
That doesn’t mean casinos are closing. Just limiting employee personnel if needed until they can determine their next move.
"So, zero sports to wager on, many buffets are closed, some restaurants are closed,shows cancelling , clubs closed, rates are practically free...why go? Wait 2 months..."
"wynn is shutting down every other slot machine, evidently, to keep distance between people. jesus."

Wait 2 months<<you wonder why people want to go if rates are practically free? lol. okay. not sure that belongs on your list. i literally go to vegas to play machines. buffets are categorically disgusting, not every restaurant is closing, and since i only eat once a day when there, ti's all good. i don't play table games. i'm not interested in shows. why go? because the things i go to do aren't shut down. not yet, anyway, lol."
At least it is contained ...
"Cosmopolitan closures, as of Monday: Red Plate, Wicked Spoon, Rose.Rabbit.Lie, Overlook Grill, Va Bene Caffe, Chelsea pool. No re-opening dates announced."
"I can bet from my sofa , play any table game as well from my sofa..I like Vegas, but nothing there that I can’t do from home any longer"
"So I wonder if most casinos have business income coverage on their property insurance. Being that it is a complicated policy usually going in the surplus and excess markets it doubt it. Secondly if they did most policies have a pathogen exclusion. So the odds are most don’t have coverage for the loss. That is why the are holding on til the last minute to close, if they close at all. The reality is the longer the keep their doors open the less of the total loss. If less people are coming in, cut the payroll. Probably some federal relief to the employees too."
"Without question the decision is entirely a financial one, to the dollar, with the PR affect factored in.That said, when they DO close soon, and they will, the statement will read, ""Our first priority is always the health and safety of our employees & guests..."""
"If/when things get worse, it wouldn't surprise me if MGM and Caesar's shut down several of their casino's and use the opportunity to do a thorough cleansing and minor revamp. Get rid of 30-50 years of stale cigarette smoke. (I'm looking at you Excalibur)."
Sources state with in the next 2 or 3 days Las Vegas will shut down.
