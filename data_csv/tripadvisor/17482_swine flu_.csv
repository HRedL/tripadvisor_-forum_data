We are supposed to go down to our time share in Cabo the week of May 24th and now (due to the media reports of the swine flu spreading in Mexico City) are concerned about whether or not we should go. Any thoughts??
I read that it's northern mainland Mexico and Mexico City. I had some concern since I'm leaving tomorrow. After reading the news I think we're okay.
"We are supposed to go to Cabo the week of May 8th and don't know, what to do. "
There were 75 cases right on your front door step!NYC!...Closed down the school due to children getting sick. Arn't you concerned about getting sick in your own town????....
Oh my god. Send me your tickets and I'll go. Did you know that there were 1526 traffic deaths in New York state in 2006. Do you still drive? People are not dying in the streets of Cabo of swine flu.
I live here and I'm happy and healthy. I don't know of anyone who has the flu here. I'm afraid to go back to the States right now because of all the deaths there.
Living in fear is fearing to live. I say just go and have a good time. You can encouter accidents or illness anywhere at anytime and that shouldnt stop you from living life to its fullest.We have planned to go on May 1st and I am not going to let the reports as they are now to stop me. Enjoy!
"I have been going to La Paz BCS every other month for the past year and a half. Since about September 2008, I get a bad cough about the time I leave La Paz. The first couple of times I got this cough it was coupled with a low grade fever and a great amount of fatigue. I recover from the harsher aspects of the cough in about two weeks at home in the USA, but the deep cough takes about one to two months to completely go away. One time, my US doctor prescribed Cipro, a very strong antibiotic. Anybody else recently having traveled to La Paz BCS have any similar experiences?"
"I am heading down 16May for 10 nights between Cabo, San Jose and Los Barriles, and other than my usual echinacea, and EmergenC I'm not going to worry. I figure that if I'm going to croak, I'd rather have had a good time first ;-)Seriously, I don't think it's time to panic. The CDC and the Media seem to have a way of blowing things way out of proportion these days......not saying it's not something to be careful about, but I wouldn't change my travel plans."
"If things continue, we won't have much choice. The government has been given authorization to cease air travel to stop the spread of the influenza. Already in Mexico City, all schools, sporting events etc are closed until at least May 6th. Be aware, and check in the CDC for updates daily. I still hope to be in Cabo in 6 days! "
"[Anybody else recently having traveled to La Paz BCS have any similar experiences?]I have gone to La Paz at least once a month, spmetimes more than once a month, for the last three years....I keep my boat there. I drive from Cabo. I have never experienced any health issues.If you are flying, airplane air circulation systems are suspect. There have been several documented cases where the circulation systems were contaminated."
"I am more worried about them deciding to cancel flights and not being able to go on our trip to Cabo, (5/3 YAY!), than getting swine flu. "
Couldn't agree with you more.
I heartily agree!!!!!!!!!!! If my flight is CAXD. I'll be hysterical!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Hi Matapule,Thanks for the response. For the record, I usually start to get the cough and fatigue after the first week that I am there in La Paz, therefore I usually have the symptoms before boarding the plane for the trip home. My Mexican neighbors think that the illness is due to inhaling the dust that is prevalent everywhere. They get the ""gripa"" themselves from time to time, especially when the wind and heat occur at the same time to whip up the dust into the air."
"I'm planning on going the May 16-23 to my timeshare in Cabo San Lucas. Bear in mind, the media does tend to hype up all this type of stuff, so try and keep it in perspective and deal with the facts rather than the ""hype aspect"" of the situation. I am regularly checking the cdc website and government travel advisories. At this point in time, I think pretty much the only way I won't go (I have to even think about it) is if there are restrictions on the borders. I plan to contact a local travel clinic to inquire about this whole issue and find out if it would be prudent to get an rx for one of the two drugs the virus is sensitive to, as a precautionary measure. My only other main thought is being around people in planes and at the airport who may have contracted this disease. You don't know where these people have come from.One thing to think about - I don't think Mexico City is a huge travel destination for vacationing tourists, for other reasons than a swine flu problem that is very prevalent there right now...Another thing, it's a well-known fact that the health care in Mexico isn't as ""great"" as it is in the US (US health care is a whole other issue and I'm not going there...). Because there are a good number of people dying there, doesn't necessarily mean death is imminent for you.All I can suggest is educate yourself and take precautions. In the event the government halts travel, then that will be another story.Hopefully as the weeks go on prior to when we travel, things will have evolved to be a bit more under control. We'll see."
"The SKY IS FALLING The SKY IS FALLINGThe statement about healthcare in Mexico is not as good as the US I wonder.When we were at the Grand Mayan in Nuevo Vallarta two years ago our friends son hit his head swimming under the water. He had a large laceration He first saw the doctor at the resort who looked at it and controlled the bleeding. He and his parents took an ambulance ride to and from the hospital saw a doctor had x-rays, got stitched up for a grand total cost of $ 250 US for everything. He received excellent care. Maybe here in the US we could learn from Mexico. This would have probably cost close to $ 2,000 here. "
"Its too early to say right now if the virus will be contained or if it will expand into a pandemic. Unfortunately those that are leaving in the next several weeks will have to take a calculated risk. My advise is if you're travelling with young kids don't go and if you do go, avoid crowds.I would also add that some of the posters are understating the potential risk by declaring that Cabo is safe and that its crazy not to go. I don't think thats rational thinking nor good advise.For the record I do think that many of us sometimes exagerate the risk of travelling to places like Mexico . The drug wars is an example of this , the swine virus unfortunately is not of these examples. The speed at which it is expanding is very concerning and I think people need to think carefully for the next 2-3 weeks before deciding to travel to Mexico. My 2 cents, in any case take care and best wishes :)"
"You hit the nail on the head Planet Wander...If this virus can spread as quickly as it has shown so far then we do have to consider how is it going to be contained, period! And it may mean that we don't go to Mexico right at this particular time to do our part as to not possibly bring anything back from there.I'm more concerned about sitting in an aircraft for 4 or 5 hours with 100 plus other people who may not have been that careful while down there...and it only takes one when you're sitting in a giant aluminium incubator to pass the virus around to everyone else in the plane.Until there is some real definitive answers from the CDC or WHO as to what the situation is, then yes, the sky could be falling. Would you like to be the one who brough it back to your hometown?"
"We were supposed to leave this morning, but we cancelled yesterday because of all the uncertainty and concern in the news. My father-in-law has a heart condition plus his dad died at a young age from the Asiatic flu - he just didn't feel comfortable going. It was a very hard decision to make for the 4 of us but we will reschedule as soon as this blows over. I think the media is making this into a bigger deal than it should be. If it were up to me, I would be in Cabo right now. I think in the next week or so more information will be out and we'll be able to see this isn't going to be a pandemic."
"Food for thought folks...just watched over 10 minutes of various coverage on the swine flu...we have two confirmed cases here in Vancouver, recent returnees from Mexico. Also a number of students at a school in Halifax who were just in Mexico...confirmed swine flu.Bottom line is the World Health Organization currently has this outbreak of swine flu rated at a level 3 (on a 1-6 scale) as far as possible pandemics go...For everyone on here that is writing this off as an overblown media story, I can't figure out how you can breath with your head stuck in the sand.Unfortunately, we are facing a serious situation which causes us to think more about sun-filled vacations."
"mfcsings, you'll get your answer in 2-3 weeks once the containment efforts can be evaluated."
where in Mexico did these people return from? 
"This just in from the Internet site, Baja Western Onion:""United States Consulate Message Re: Flu Outbreak in Mexico - U.S. Consulate General Tijuana advises that as a precaution, Mexican authorities closed all schools in the Federal District and in the State of Mexico (Mexico City) on April 24, 2009, as the Mexican Secretariat of Health announced hundreds of cases of flu in the country, some of which may be the H1N1 strain of ""swine flu"". Some other public institutions, such as museums and government offices, are also closed. Exact numbers of the people infected with the various strains of flu are unavailable. The U.S. Consulate General has no additional information about closures. The U.S. Consulate General reminds U.S. citizens in Mexico that most cases of influenza are not ""swine flu""; any specific questions or concerns about flu or other illnesses should be directed to a medical professional. At this time the Mexican Secretariat of Health urges people to avoid large crowds, shaking hands, kissing people as a greeting, or using the subway. Maintaining a distance of at least six feet from other persons may decrease the risk of exposure. In addition, the following prevention tips are from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) website: 1. Avoid close contact. - Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too. 2. Stay home when you are sick. - If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. You will help prevent others from catching your illness. 3. Cover your mouth and nose. - Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. 4. Clean your hands. - Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. 5. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. - Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. 6. Practice other good health habits. - Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. For additional information, please consult the CDC website at www.cdc.gov, or the website of the World Health Organization at www.who.int. The U.S. Embassy will also post additional information as it becomes available on their website at: …usembassy.gov/eng/citizen_services.html.---------------------------------------------------Swine Flu Update - This is from a trusted friend of mine in Puerto Vallarta: I have just had a lengthy conversation with an infectious disease physician from Puerto Vallarta, who is on his way back from an emergency meeting in Guadalajara. There have been NO CONFIRMED CASES in the state of Jalisco (Puerto Vallarta). When I asked him if we are at risk here in Puerto Vallarta he said: Yes - every time someone sneezes we are at risk. When I asked him what we can do to prevent being infected he said: - Drink 50% more fluids than you normally do. - Take Vitamin A, D and B Vitamins - There IS NO vaccine available at this time. He stressed DO NOT RUSH OUT AND GET A FLU VACCINE - this is because for 3 weeks after receiving the flu vaccine, the body has a lower immune system. My friend did suggest staying away from crowded areas. Wash, Wash, Wash, Wash, Wash - hands, house, all areas."""
"You people seem to be missing what is obvious (to me) - you will be flying with people in a small tube for a number of hours that may be sick - that is when you would catch it. You are contagious for about one day before you have symptoms. I'm supposed to go on Thursday and come back on Sunday. I'm more worried about the trip back - the flight originates in Mexico City, stops in Cabo and goes on to San Diego. This is a problem!!!! Once in Cabo, I'm not so worried, but catching something on the plane trip is much more likely than catching it walking the streets of Cabo. "
"matapule, I have never heard of a killed virus vaccine that temporarily lowers your resistance and I don't believe it is true.50 Percent more fluid? Based upon what?This doctor is making statements that are not evidence-based and I'd be skeptical."
"Shadow 1017, wear a mask on the plane. I did that once when I flew while pregnant. I knew I could not take any medication if I got sick, and didn't want to be breathing all that circulated air. "
"I wish I had 2 weeks before we were going. We're going May 1st. That doesn't leave much time for things to settle. I'm not as worried about the virus as I am being worried about having some symptoms when we need to leave...and can't get home, because they won't let us on the plane. And having to deal with Mexico's health plan. Lord only knows about that...???? At this point, we're going to go. We're watching and reading as much as possible to stay informed. I'm still going back and forth, though, in my mind. My husband isnt' worried. Since we're going for 10 days using a RCI timeshare trade, we can't get anything refunded or changed. So may as well go, and enjoy it, if we can. "
"We are booked to leave for Cabo on May 9, with our condo booked thru RCI...not sure what kind of trade you did thru RCI but we booked and paid an additional $52 for cancellation insurance...so in the event that we do decide not to go, our entire week is deposited back into our RCI account. The only $$$ lost is the $52 for the insurance which is damn cheap for an entire week."
"I found this statement on an article found through Google. Authorities in Baja California said they haven't seen any cases of the virus, but will install special modules at airports and bus terminals in Tijuana and Mexicali to assist and register passengers with flulike symptoms. I am also leaving for Cabo this weekend coming up, May 2nd so had to do my research.Hope this puts your mind at ease a litte."
"I just read this in www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/news.I was wondering if anyone knew this website?""Cabo San Lucas is located in Baja California, where swine flu cases have been confirmed. Health officials in the state of Jalisco, in which Puerto Vallarta is located, have no confirmed cases but said Saturday they identified 18 people with flu-like symptoms who may be infected and are awaiting test results."""
"Love travel - This map posted by tacCabo shows where cases of swine flu are. As you can see, the Baja markers are 1000 miles from Cabo up by the California border.maps.google.com/maps/ms…"
"Quite honestly, I am going, unless the flights are cancelled. One thing I find interesting is that the demographics of the cases in MEX haven't been mentioned..............My trip commences on 16May, so I've got my fingers crossed!"
" Wow........I usually go down in Nov./Dec. I'm leaving(?) on May 4th to join family that are already there. I'll contact them to see how they're doing & if there are any issues...........&, if the flight isn't cancelled (Alaska 205), I'll just plan on joining them. I'll report anything negative I hear. I agree with others..........the plane ride may be the most likely place to catch this crap."
"I just checked the CDC alert and here is my 2 cents worth……""CDC has NOT recommended that people avoid travel to Mexico at this time. If you are planning travel to Mexico, follow these recommendations to reduce your risk of infection and help you stay healthy."" You can find the recommendations mentioned on their website.Don’t get me wrong. I am very concerned about my fiancée. He has chronic respiratory issues. He made an appointment with his doctor to discuss any precautions he may need to take for home and abroad (only because I am making him). Unless the doctor recommends he not go, we are not planning on cancelling our trip. Also, the one thing MANY news reports are failing to mention is that a significant percentage of the reported deaths were because people did NOT seek medical attention in time. And if you exhibit flu like symptoms, you will not be allowed to board a plane until you are medically cleared. Which I think should be standard practice BUT, that’s another subject. Don’t get me wrong. I am not trying to say that there are not any risks. Of course there are. I also think things are little overblown in the news reports. Besides, there are no confirmed cases in Baja California Sur. The only 2 in all of Baja, were near the US/Mexico border. As of today, you have just as much chance of catching it at home as you do in Cabo. Of course this could change tomorrow but I plan having so many margaritas that I don’t think ANY germ could survive in me! JMHOToni "
"Hi mfcsings, you must have your cities mixed up. Swine Flu is in LA, it is not in Cabo.You had better get out while you still can - tequila awaits!"

"New Grama,Thanks for the map, I'll be in alert before cancelling. I travel from May 22 to Jume 1. I will wait until cancelling my trip.thanks againLove_travel_a_lot_8"
We are suppose to go down the 16th of May. I just read an article that said there have been confirmed cases of the swine flu in Cabo. We are debating as to what to do also.
my husband heard on TV that being the last portion of the flu season that swine epidemic might end soon.I hope they are right because or else there goes are spring vacation.I was really looking forward to this vacation. I am going to be optimistic and bet that everything ends by the time we get there.
lovetravel..a characteristic that worries WHO and CDC is that this struck late spring as the 1918 hit late spring and ran rampant through summer.Let's all cross our fingers and not listen to anything that isn't coming directly from CDC or WHO. 
"50% more fluids than you regularly drink. He is just saying to increase your fluid intake. But also, vitamins A,D,E, and K are fat soluble vitamins and people need to be aware that they do have toxicity levels and should take too much. They'll try to take alot to protect themselves from the flu and end up with nutrition problems instead."
Where did you read that there were confirmed cases in Cabo. As far as I read there were no cases in cabo or san jose. 
I just looked at the google map another member posted and there are no flu cases in Cabo ...on the map. We are supposed to be leaving a week from thurs (May 7th) for San Jose del Cabo and are a little concerned...but not overly. We feel like the main places with the most risk are the airports. The resort should be fine.
"There have been two confirmed cases in Baja Norte, close to the border. It figures since there have been cases in San Diego. That is, of course, a long way from Cabo; however, Spain is a long way from Mexico also. Where the disease appears depends on who has been where, and there is no way to predict that."
tequilla kills everyting.. cabo wabo here i come. MARGARITA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
School has been cancelled throughout the Republic of Mexico. Link to Washington Post article:washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/20…
"There have been cases reported in Cabo San Lucas, as of 3 hours ago. FoxNews has reported 15 cases in Cabo, and the American Disease Association has said to not travel to any areas in Mexico unless essential. All airline companies and hotels should be refunding money. The US has advised to stop ALL trips to Mexico, if you value your life I suggest you follow the suggestion. Swine Flu IS appearing in Cabo, and it is not wise to fly there at the persent. "
"We are suppose to leave for Cabo May 3rd, given the situation we are going to try somewhere else. Most of the airlines are going to allow change in flights without penalty. I know Cabo isnt anywhere near Mexico City but is it really worth it? Not too far North there have been confirmed cases, not too long now and before i'm finished with this who knows. Never tried Russian Rulette but dont want to. Think about it, would you travel to Afganistan now? Mexico is a great place and would love to go but must think about more than myself. "
"I am most worried about the flight to Cabo and back. We are flying down on May 20th, returning June 17th. I think I'll breathe into my own pillow!I do believe staying out of crowds and being more alert to people around you might help. I'm bringing lots of tissues. Keep your hands away from your mouth, nose, eyes. Buy a hand sanitizer. But I'm not cancelling my trip."
"importantnews...There is no such organization as the ""American Disease Association""I looked at Fox News online. NO mention of Cabo San Lucas..Provide details...This is the kind of posting that skews everything!"
"I am also going down to cabo this friday and I was concerned with the flu, but it seems the flu has not hit cabo yet. It seems that I can get this flu here closer to home. The only thing I'm concered with right now is if everything will be open as normal there..as far as clubs & restaurtants. Does anyone know what I should expect when I go?"
"Would you please completely educate yourself before you make any decision. To say that the virus is not in Cabo is completely incorrect...and it only takes one, just one person to spread it around. This virus spreads quickly...and you want to go to nightclubs...exactly the kind of places that they are warning people to stay away from.It is obviously your decision when it comes to decide on whether or not to go but do give it some rational thought...for a moment think of what you touch or handle in a normal day...or the number of people you may come in contact with.And do remember this, the airport is a melting pot of people flying in and out from everywhere...and this virus is not isolated to Mexico anymore...again you're going to be in that airport for at least two hours and then depending on where you live, your flight could be 2 to 6 hours...you may have to change planes at another airport...again more chance of contact.It definately is a scary situation and I really don't think many people have given it complete and thourough thought.In closing...consider the possibility that you depart...you're having a great week or two...and things begin to worsen with this flu...and the borders close and you can't get home...it's all possible.Or, we could all bury our collective heads in the sand and believe this is just the ""mere flu"""
"i am here in cabo right now~ the feeling at my timeshare at haceinda encantada is that you need to be aware and responsible to yourself. washing hands, staying out of crowds and not kissing strangers! THERE ARE 2 MEN INFECTED HERE ONLY APPARENTLY..i plan on staying closer to the resort than normal for my 2 weeks~ no one is wearing masks here.."
Is everything open as normal?
"If you search the news you will also not find any reports of cases in Cabo San Lucas. This is a bogus post. There are a couple of cases reported (not confirmed) about 1,000 miles north in Mexicali and Tijuana - people see ""Baja California"" and immediately conflate it with Cabo, even though Cabo is in an entirely different state.I would also not recommend using Fox News as your authority for anything to do with Mexico - they are the worst of the worst for hype and misinformation. Verify anything you read with independent sources, and if the post contains no link to verify a claim, question why."
Hey BigEEEEThe Blackhawks are going to bury your Canucks in the sand!!! Go Hawks!!!!Lets change the subject and talk sports. What happens to stadiums across the US and Canada? Are they going to cancel the Stanley Cup due to this flu? HECK NO.I survived SARS and the Avian flu. No pig is taking me out. I'm educated and cautious. I take risks every day. My life ain't going to change.Hawks in 6!Miles of smiles!!!!! Good luck.
So do you know if everything in cabo is open as normal? I'm leaving to go there on friday. Just curious on what I should expect.
"I'd like to know if business is as usual over there too because I am leaving Saturday..... I think.But if everything is going to be closed, I'll postpone my trip for another time.If anyone knows, please advise."
This is what my GF found out:Carissa says: *that was doc jim *he freaked out when he read on face book i was gng to mexico *and then when i told him it was cabo he was like *oh- ull be fine there my brother lives close to there and he says its not that bad *just dont get in someones face when they r sneezing *haha *gross!!!--So while not totally easing of the mind...makes me cross my fingers tighter
"Some friends and I are supposed to go to cabo san lucas on the 11th of may. Im very ticked that the news has made this look so bad. I read somewhere that this years flu shot (U.S.) contains what we need to ward it off. I'm not sure if this is true. We really dont want to cancel, if we need to wear masks on the plane and use alcohal wipes then so be it. maybe stay out of the crowded nightclubs at night. Everyone needs to look at current reports from the CDC, WHO and there are others angencys. We will watch the warnings and hopefully things look better soon. at this point we're thinking of going anyway but we'l see. Good luck everyone and dont watch the tv but rather look it up straight from the horses mouth. My only fear at this point is getting stuck in quarantine in mexico for a few days on the way back, the people who share that quarantine could very well have it!"
"from what I've read and heard, I'm not too concerned with the flu itself. So far, NO ONE outside of Mexico has died or even suffered more than mild symptoms from this virus. As it is, there are only 20 confirmed cases of deaths in Mexico City out of a population of 20 million. More people die from the normal flu every year than that. There can be other factors besides the flu as to why these people died, ie, extreme poverty, crowded filthy conditions, etc. What people have to realize is that while humans may have no natural immunity to the swine flu, the swine flu virus also has no natural attack mechanisms to the human metabolism. That is probably why the majority of cases outside of Mexico has been mild. My major concern is going to Cabo in two weeks and find the bars all closed and no one down there because of the scare."
"New York Times link to four experts weighing in on how worried or not worried we should be.…nytimes.com/2009/…PBS newshour can always be counted on for level-headed, non-inflammatory coverage (some call it boring). They had on CDC last night.Another good source for level headed experts is PBS's Charlie Rose. I TIVO it and only watch if it is something I'm interested in.And, New York Times is a good source, as well as CDC website. Avoid headlines and radio/tv news which thrive on misinformaation and alarm."
"I love this comment Anne left from the NY Times link.""I think it’s going to get worse considering how fast it’s moving. I just don’t know how to protect myself. I live in Texas and there have been some confirmed cases, plus I have to eat Texas pork. What should I do?""This is how fear and panic gets started, IMO."
don't get porked in texas.
"As of 10 A.M., there are still ZER0 cases in Cabo. There was a person that they thought did, but it was Hepatitis. ??? My BFF here's hubby is a Dr., he'd know, and sent an email stating we are 0K at this time. FYI..."
"I'm supposed to be going on Thursday and I am struggling. I can take Tamiflu and wear a surgical mask at the airport/on the plane, but I am a bit concerned that the town will be ""shut down"" at night, which is a big part of the fun. Any more updates from those in Cabo as to status of restaurants and bars? "
Here is a great read.…msn.com/health-topics/articlepage.aspx…
"farmer...Anne from NYTimes...no accounting for others critical thinking or reading skills, or emotional balance....because the Times is clearly saying, again and again, no reason to panic.CDC and WHO are doing exactly what they need to do and it's up to grownups to inform themselves...which is pretty danged easy."
Everything is open.
"Shadow...leave the mask at home...viruses are way smaller than the holes in that mask. You'd need a full-on respirator to do much good. Maybe a mask would help IF someone had the flu, and they coughed and sneezed in to it, but it would only limit some of the droplets. Maybe it would help if someone was with flu and drooling? Grin."
"cpa...liked that news article you linked. I have a lot of confidence in WHO and CDC and all that was learned from SARS and Avian outbreak.I'm grateful that our government does such a good job with public health and how non-alarmist they have been.We don't need to worry, because they are doing the worrying for us. "
"NOOO we just got a call from itravel2000.com that our flight has been canceled so our vacation is canceled. Not fair! It was supposed to be our honeymoon.I am so upset. My fiance and I were going to go for it, we didn't think we would get too sick if at all and we were looking forward to staying in the Riu. and argh. I know this is better than if we did get sick but still, this is so unfair. "
" I know there have already been responses from people that live/are already in Cabo right now...........I'll just add that I spoke to my sister, who is at the VDArco right now with other family members, & she says that there are no worries around town..........everything appears to be biz as usual. I'm supposed to go down on Monday for an abbreviated stay through Sat. My worries are much the same as others here..........not that I'll be in danger when down there, just during the flights...............& perhaps the possibility of being stranded due to flight cancellation/border closure. I'm gonna wait til the last moment & make a decision........"
"Everyone needs to take a deep breath, relax, and stop thinking with your emotions. As usual, the media gets everyone all riled up over something that we deal with all the time. The flu is a common occurrence every year. So why the panic of this flu? 30,000 to 40,000 people per year die in our country from the garden variety flu but does the media or our politicians start a panic over that? Just use some common sense. Don't stop you life based on these over hyped warnings. The sky is not falling. "
"Do you think that this is, as you put it, ""garden variety"" type flu??...Did you learn to make that prognosis from Purdue??If you have been doing your own research this particular strain of flu is a combination of virus' previously unseen, in this form.So to make such an lovely educated guess, like you have, geez...you should join 'em in Atlanta, they could use your help at the CDC"
"BigEeee,I'm not saying it isn't something people should be aware of. What I am saying is people shouldn't panic and put their live's on hold because of it. We all take a calculated risk everyday driving our cars but we still do it. People are free to choose whether to travel or not. I just want the media to report the story responsibly and stop acting like this is the next black plague. SARS, bird flu, etc. all turned out to be pretty much non-events. This swine flu will likely be the same."
"In reading some of the posts it seems like some are just making stuff up, making guesses, listening to dumb news outlets..I don't know.Why make stuff up or guess when the information coming from Public Health is so clear...and so NON-ALARMIST.I'm not hearing a lot of alarm on the news outlets I trust so if , as many of you are saying...blaming ""the media""...well, then, time for you to get some NEW media.CNN, PBS, New York Times, NBC...it has been pretty straight forward."
"Okay everyone. Here's the real deal from someone who went to Cabo 4/10/09 to 4/17/09. (the week before the headlines about swine flu) My husband came down with severe chills, fever, body ache, headache, and stomache pain the second day into our trip. He was not hungover and all five of us ate the same foods. Didn't go to any clubs, so rule that one out too. He was bedridden for 24 hours and did not feel ""normal"" again until 5 days after our return from Cabo. Don't know what kind of flu it was and had not heard about swine flu until we got home...so, bottom line, he had the flu on our vacation which sucks but he is alive and well and back to work. Truthfully, the germiest part of traveling is the airplane. Even without a pandemic!"
"I am sorry to hear your hubby had the flu while on what I assume was a much anticipated, well deserved vacation!Reminder to all...it takes several days to show symptoms with the flu; he most likely ""had it"" before he ever got on the plane or left his house. "
as far as i know..i have only spoken with the hotel manager here..i am only quoting her...not trying to post a bogus post!everything is open! no one is wearing masks....i have been here for a week with 10 days left! and i am not going anywhere!Just use common sense!don't eat in dives or on the street..get up on your vitamins and immune system treatmentsstay out of crowds (cabo wabo! HA!)WASH THOSE HANDS A LOT! BRING WIPES!
i had something similar last fall..it was a parasite called a fluke... coughed forever!some deal coming back from cabo..check out a naturalpathic doctor or a MD to get rid of them..you'll also be tired~
"I am an aircraft mechanic. Aircraft air circulation systems are only contaminated if the air that the people on board are exhaling is contaminated. It's the PEOPLE, not the AIRCRAFT that bring on the contamination in air travel."
"Well said, hoosierchris - I couldn't agree more. We deal with a flu season EVERY year here in the US and everywhere else in the world. Planes fly everyday with sick people on board, it's just part of the ""risk"" we take living among other people. I would no more cancel my trip to Cabo based on all this nonsense then I would cancel a trip to New England in the winter because of the flu season there. The biggest danger we have with all this is OVERREACTION and panic. "
"Everyone is certainly entitled to their own opinion and entitled to make their own decisions regarding traveling to Cabo right now. Mexico is a big country so it's not fair to group Cabo in with Mexico City; however, if the U.S. Government increases border control or travel restrictions for people returning from Mexico it won't matter whether you are returning from Cabo or Mexico City. If someone on your return flight shows symptoms your plane will most likely be quarantined (see flight from Cancun to Baltimore). If you get sick in Cabo from eating or drinking something then you'll fear the worst. My point is: the fact that the swine flu hasn't reached Cabo or there are no known cases in Cabo doesn't matter much to me. I wouldn't be too concerned with contracting swine flu in Cabo, I'd be concerned with whehther I could make it home from Cabo. "
"Still no cases in Cabo. The Mayor of Mexico City said things have stabilized and he is considering easing the citywide shutdown. Vivienne Allan from the WHO's patient safety program said the death toll has been extremely overstated. She said there have only been 7 deaths, all in Mexico. As usual, things don't seem near as bad as the hype. The worst seems to have past.I'm heading to Cabo next Monday. I see no reason not to go. The wife and I are taking Tamiflu with us just in case. Just use common sense and take common sense precautions. "
"The number of confirmed swine flu cases in the United States included 45 in New York, 11 in California, six in Texas, two in Kansas and one each in Indiana and Ohio. Flu deaths are common around the world. In the U.S. alone, the CDC says about 36,000 people a year die of flu-related causes. The regular flu kills just under 100 U.S. children every winter - 73 in the 2006-2007 flu season. Isn't is possible that the media is blowing this ever so slightly out of proportion and sensationalizing it to draw attention to themselves and make money???"
"I hope you all don't think the WHO and CDC is overreacting and panic, they don't treat this case as other type of flu.And good luck to those who still want to go, hope they won't close the border and stuck down there, WHO put this very close to level 5 this morning.news.aol.ca/article/…"
"Gosh im sitting here twiddeling my thumbs about all of this also, my week is may 30th so i see i have some time to see where this is all heading or ending. I have tried to call reservation for solmar and the phones are suposidly not working at this time i was told by resortcom where i send my maitenance fees. At this time i think there getting overwhelmed with calls. All i want to know is if they say we shouldnt travel at the time of my timeshare wee if we can go another week. then in reading the others who went through RCI it just gave me the obvious idea i should have thought of duh....deposit it in RCI. I also went on travelocity and they had a link for you to go to about swine flu and the airlines at this point are letting you change dates for flying for free and a few other ways of compensating you through may 20th at this point, so that made me think ok well its not like i wont beable to go its just going to be delayed until all of this gets figured out and over with. And ofcourse all my family are freaking out if i go. So deposit your week to everyone who is scared to go at this time. And get your flights postponed, Sounds good to me, but i will give it all a few more weeks. "
"If and possibly when the WHO moves to a Level 5 with this, that is when you'll see things really tighten down.I believe one of the biggest concerns right now for people that are travelling to Mexico, is not getting the flu, but getting home. If this escalates, and indications are that it will, then it could get tricky...only time will tell.As much as we already miss our trip to Cabo, cancelled everything this morning, I just can't believe being down there over the next two to three weeks can be relaxing, given the uncertainty of the whole situation...and I'm just not talking about the spread of the flu...there is a much bigger picture to look at.All I can say is hope you all have safe travels."
"""Border controls do not work. Travel restrictions do not work,"" WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in Geneva, recalling the SARS epidemic earlier in the decade that killed 774 people, mostly in Asia, and slowed the global economy. "
"I'm not saying that they will close the borders, just that there may be the possibility that airlines in the U.S. will do the same thing as they have done here in Canada...I'm sure they would take those steps before closing the border.And, as for the economy...we can't get much slower then we are now. Mind you I wouldn't mind shares in a certain drug manufacturing company..."
"WHO update (in part) for 4/29:""WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders. It is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay international travel and for people developing symptoms following international travel to seek medical attention, in line with guidance from national authorities.""www.who.int/csr/don/2009_04_29/en/index.html"
 WHO has just raised the pandemic awareness to level 5 –so what now?www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30398682?GT1=43001
"Level 5..that makes it difficult. It means they think pandemic is ""imminent"", but still, the final level is 6, which declares pandemic.In the last 300 years there have been 3 pandemics per century...with 3 occuring in the last century.If it is going to be a pandemic we can hope it will be a mild pandemic."
"We're still going. Our trip starts May 15th and unless flights are canceled, we're still going. I even called the property today and everything is business as usual. No closures in town or anywhwere. "
"Oh don't worry...no need to panic...throw the hysteria out the door...as many of the experts on here have said...this is just another case of ""garden variety"" flu.And trust me, I won't role out the numbers of all the people that death each year from the flu.Maybe it will take a level 6 alert for some to understand."
"If you are interested in getting a sense of how WHO and CDC are viewing this, the complexity, and the possibility that this years flu shot is giving some effect for milder cases, then watch this 15 minute segement from PBS's Charlie Rose from Monday. www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10256It is such a good site that it won't need to buffer, unless you have dial-up.Based upon this and some other recent statements from SOME CDC researchers (notice I said ""some""), our family members that skipped this seasons flu shot are getting them today and tomorrow."
" Q. Are you saying everything’s business as usual in Mexico, nothing’s going on and therefore tourists should keep on with their plans to travel to Mexico? Isn’t that irresponsible?The Mexico Tourism Board’s mission is to ensure that tourists have an extraordinary experience in Mexico so they want to come back. Therefore, our tourists’ well-being is a top priority. I’d like to point out that both, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC), as well as the U.S. State Department, have said that there was no need for U.S. travelers to change, restrict or alter their plans to travel to Mexico. In addition, these organizations have not issued any special precautionary measures; they’ve only issued reminders of their habitual flu-prevention precautions. Q. What specific health clinics/facilities/resources do tourists have with respect to the flu outbreak? Are health facilities in tourist areas prepared to handle such an outbreak or pandemic?Mexican health authorities are working hand-in-hand with the WHO to assure early detection and warning, and respond proactively quickly. They are well-equipped to handle the outbreak, and this includes having the facilities, equipment and contingency plans in place, to confront this issue. Q. Can you guarantee that there’s no risk for tourists to contract swine flu in Mexico?We can guarantee that Mexican health authorities are working hand-in-hand with the WHO to assure early detection and warning, and respond proactively quickly.

Has anyone that has visited Cabo in the last week or two returned yet? Or is anyone still there and feeling ok sine you've been there?
"We decided to cancel. We go to Cabo every year and planned on going this February anyway. We were going to be going on the 16th of May. Had no problem with getting our week back but they would not credit us our airfare. Said that they would only credit to May 6th. That is more than a little irritating. By the way, booked Aruba in place of Cabo."
"My college son is also scheduled to fly to Cabo San Lucas on May 24 from Portland OR. I called the resort and they said they had not had any cases in Cabo but my concern really isn't at Cabo itself it's at the connecting hub airports that they fly from Portland to, and then on to Cabo. If you hear anything specific, maybe you could email me at dsword@cyberis.net with any news since we are in the same boat? Thank you"
"I am heading to Cabo May 4. I spoke to my resort this morning. Everything is fine there. Business activity is normal and there are no plans on shutting anything down. Still no reported cases in Cabo. From my readings on the internet, it seems Mexico is getting some control of this. It is concentrated in central Mexico. The number of U.S. cases now stands at 110. It doesn't appear to be spreading very fast. Common sense tells me this will not amount to a whole lot. "
"hoosier...another explanation that CDC is looking at is that the flu did spread really fast but most cases went unreported...which could be great news because that means relatively mild cases.A few days ago I didn't know if I would cancel a trip or not but, ironically, when WHO moved it to ""pandemic imminent"", level 5, and US is seeing the spread and knows mathematically there are many cases incubating here...well, the idea of containment seems less important and so now I would lean towards going."
"Pandemics often come in three waves. My biology major, pre-med kid said that since this first wave SEEMS (can't be sure yet) to be relatively mild, then he would prefer to get it now. Intriguing logic?  The 1918 pandemic started mild in the late spring, ran mildly through summer, then mutated to ferocicity by fall, then after a few months, the third wave of more mild."
"Absolutely correct about the flu coming in waves and that strikes a huge fear here in Vancouver.Last night on our over-hyped fearmongering newscast they interviewed Dr. Daniel Kalla, Baja you may recognise that name...he is a doctor here at St. Paul's Hospital and one of the world's top docs in infectious diseases and also penned the top selling book, ""Pandemic""Anyhow, getting back to the waves...his fear is that this is the first wave...a possible second could hit in the fall and the third wave, early in the new year, Jan/Feb 2010. Date ring a bell?? Winter Olympics, Vancouver. We can only hope that this fizzles at the first wave."
"our trip is booked for June, we are going to wait to make any decisions about going or cancelling, until 2 weeks before...i am hoping there will be some sort of definitive answers/solutions by thenif by then everything is still up in the air, not sure what we'll do...but you'd sure think they'll have had anough time to say...you're fine to go, or the borders will be closedto anyone leaving within the next 2weeks, i would suggest postponing until more information is provided i think it would be horrible if travellers proceded with their trips, only to be contained in mexico due to the closing of bordersi think it's far too early in the game to know one way or the other how this thing will pan outi know tht i am looking forward to our trip immensely, but have succumbed to the possibility of it being cancelled...(still prayin like mad it won't be)"
"BigEE...you hit nail on head. The public will look and say, ""hey, what's the big deal...a few are getting it, similar to regular flu..what's all the fuss?""True, media screws it up and obsesses.But, what the experts who've spent lifetime studying flu are looking at is not the same the public is looking at. There are some big unusual things with this swine flu...red flags...which hopefully will not go to bad scenarios...prediction models of mutations...joining with another H1N1 strain earlier this year in Texas that was resistant to all antivirals, etc...They don't know what this one will do. I feel very confident/safe that they are watching this so closely and fast-tracking a vaccine in case it goes to a more virulent stage.I thought long and hard about what I could do and only came up with two things: wash hands and have family members that skipped their vaccine this year go and get jabbed.After that, I'm not worried, because it is wasted energy, out of your hands."
"islanjenn...I tivo'ed the CDC officials testifying before Congress yesterday when John McCain pressed them on border closings (not medically warranted was the answer) and then, ""Well, under what scenarios would you advise border closing"". CDC answered that there was no scenario, medically warranted, that would advise closing the borders.CDC gave medical answer, not political answer.So,there might be reasons not to go come June, but it isn't likely we will see border closings."
What article did you read?? I have heard the opposite that the Baja has been unaffected by this. Can you please advise me on the atricle asI leave on May 10th and am looking forward to my trip. My sister lives in Washington and there are 6 cases. I believe we have a better chance of getting it where we reside then in Cabo.
"i actually just heard the same thing about borders closing...probably not gonna happen..but there is still a possibility of being quarantined in mexico(or usa for that matter) should this take a turn for the worse my folks left this past monday to go on mexican cruise and they turned the ship around yesterday, they are not entering any ports in mexicothis is a waiting game, and unfortunately for travellers there is huge risk pursuing anything immediately, because of the risk involvedif i had a trip planned in the next week, i'd be cancelling....however like i stated previously, our trip is in June, we should know something definitive by then"
"Just got back from Cabo on April 29th. Everything seemed quite normal there. They locals didn't seem to be to concearned. However I read an artical that about the cruise lines, and in mentioned there were confimred cases in Cabo.I wouldn't be to worried about the flu, however many people are canceling, and the planes coming in when we left were nearly empty, so I would be more affraid of flights getting canceled. The flight we flew out on, only had 5 passengers arriving!!"
"There is a lot of misinformation flying around the internet about this topic. I have seen anywhere from 7 to 159 deaths in Mexico with total people infected from 97 to 1600. Who knows what the true number is. My wife was told by a co-worker that the border was closed. This proved to be false. It is not likely that the border will be closed unless we get to a phase 6 alert, which doesn't appear likely at this point. I spoke to the resort I will be staying. Everything in Cabo is normal. "
Even at phase 6 the border will not likely be closed...flights might be another story...
"I haven't been able to get an update on swine tracker map since the 28th. Has there been any reports of the flu there yet? Were coming down to San Jose on the 5th-15th, no mater what unless it's a huge outbreak. I think the media has scared alot of people. Use comman sence! 36,000 people died in the U.S. alone last year."
"I have booked my vacation in Los Cabos starting May 20. Naturally, we are concerned with the swine flu. Can somebody advise us if we should travel to Los Cabos? Thanks in advance."
"CAColonel,Only you can make that decision. Here are the two web sites I'm using to help me make the same decision. You might want to wait a week or two before making a decision, because things will probably change.http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/index.htmhttp://www.who.int/en/"
 I spoke with some relatives who are down there right now............no one is wearing masks or anything. I'm scheduled to leave Monday & I'm going..........unless I get sick or the flight is cancelled.
"Do you know half a million people die evry year from flu virus's and not pig flu. You have more chance of dying from a car crash as you drive to work in the morning. Everyone needs to relax, remember how the bird flu was going to kill us all last year? What happened to that. In a month you won't even remeber this. By the way the pig flu had a previous break out in 1976 and that lasted a few weeks. the media once again has the feeble minded scared as they always do. Enjoy staying home sheep."
"We are going May 14th and have NO plans to cancel, unless the airlines do. The Swine Flu is in the Baja area of Mexico, BUT ONLY UP NORTH NEAR TIJUANA AND THE US/MEXICAN BORDER. I've called my Dr. and my travel agent and both are telling me not to cancel, that they have not had any concerns with anyone traveling from Cabo. We also did our research and we'll be fine. Please do wash your hands at all times and stay away from those confined spaces where people may sneeze and/or cough near you.Have Fun! You'll be fine! We plan on it!"
"Some news. Continental cutting flights.continental.com/web/…Continental Airlines Announces Temporary Reductions in Mexico Capacity Total capacity to Mexico reduced by 50 percent; Continental continues to serve all Mexico destinationsHOUSTON, May 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) today released the following employee bulletin to its more than 43,000 employees.EMPLOYEE BULLETIN NO. 9Continental today announced significant, temporary reductions in capacity to Mexico, effective May 4, 2009, in response to lower demand. Initially, for the month of May, the company has reduced capacity to Mexico as measured by available seat miles (ASMs) by approximately 50 percent, compared to its original May 2009 flight schedule. Flight departures have been reduced by approximately 40 percent. These reductions constitute approximately 2.0 percent of Continental's systemwide ASMs for May 2009 compared to its original May 2009 flight schedule. Reductions are being implemented by using smaller aircraft on flights to Mexico or by reducing the frequency of flights to any one destination. Prior to these reductions, Continental operated an average of 450 weekly flights to the country.""Given the swift changes we are seeing in the marketplace, we need to react prudently but quickly to bring our capacity more into line with demand,"" said Larry Kellner, chairman and chief executive officer. ""We were already experiencing soft market conditions due to the economy, and now our Mexico routes in particular have extra weakness. Our plan going forward will be to continue to monitor demand levels we are seeing and adjust our capacity and costs accordingly.""Continental continues to serve all 29 of its destinations in Mexico and customers are assured that return travel from Mexico remains available, although schedules and routings may change.Continental is notifying affected customers about options for re-accommodation on different flights as close as possible in time to their original flights. In addition, the company extended its waiver policy for customers traveling to Mexico, allowing them to change their itinerary without penalty through May 31, 2009.SOURCE Continental Airlines CONTACT: Corporate Communications of Continental Airlines, +1-713-324-5080, corpcomm@coair.com "
"I'm goin' June 6th...mask, gloves and all if needed... Work is too stressful in Nation's Capital.(agree with the tequilla immunization and more risk catching it on the plane ride)."
Im going on the 15th of May and staying at Del Arco! The only way I'm not going is if my flight gets cancelled on Alaska airlines!The press is making way too big a deal out of it!!!
"I'm going with my Mom the 11-18 & am staying at the Sunset Beach. I’ll wear a mask or whatever it takes to go, this is the first trip I've taken WITHOUT my 3 kids like ever- I don't care if the hole place is sick or disserted or whatever- sick or non sick I'll still have fun- PARTY ON!!. "
"As I predicted, not only is this the wimpiest epidemic ever, the news is already beginning to admit that the signs say it's going to blow over quickly - www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,518578,00.htmlI think people that cancel out of coming down are going to feel a little silly in a few days or weeks at most. "
I cancelled my july Cabo trip. If this flu scare fizzles out next week I'll rebook. No problemo
"I didn't hear the experts saying this was going to be something terrible. What I consistently heard was:1. We don't have enough information to know what this will be2. There are worrisome signs (time of year, new strain, not familiar to our bodies like the seasonal flu, cluster of fatalities...)3. We're going to implement protocols just in case it goes bad...but we don't have enough info yet.People saying this was ""nothing"" were just as much guessing as those saying this was going to be ""catastrophic"".I think the people who were in tough spot were the ones who had trips leaving last week and first part of this week...before we had a better sense of how this was panning out. Those were tough calls.And, let's cross our fingers but one scenario of pandemics, the 1918 in particular, was showing up at a bizarre time of year, late spring, coming on mild, simmering over summer while spreading slowly, then by Fall, mutated to virulent strain killing 100 million. WHO and CDC are going to err on the side of caution because of that...and just ignore the criticism of laymen.And, Thank God for that. "
great opinionmau
"Maybe not experts, but the news certainly were alarmist, as was our dumb VP. If there's anything that should disqualify you as president, it's picking Joe Biden as VP. And that's the point, let the actual experts do their thing while we continue to live life to the fullest. You're more likely to get fried by lightening right now. Certainly far more likely to be killed by the regular flu. They're not trying to contain this, just moderate it, so that means we just have another flu strain, just like many others. I've heard no one until today say that the indications are that this is not a particularly dangerous strain nor have I heard anyone say 'this could easily blow over or be a normal thing' until today. I thought it was pretty obvious all along with the low rate of transmission, response to treatment and mild symptoms. And the use of words like ""pandemic"" put the fear of God into people. They think of people lying in the streets, hospitals doing triage, family members dying, the world as they know it shutting down. I've heard no one trying to explain that a pandemic is a description, not a world wide catastrophe. I think there were a lot of uber geeks that finally got a chance to be on TV and were not exactly doing anything to prevent them being invited back. "
"From the beginning there were reasons for public health to be concerned while they were also saying, in every way imaginable, WE DON""T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION...we need a little more time to get the data, this is precautionary. Again and again, Obama said, ALERT, not ALARM and CDC said ""precautionary""Think of it as a hurricane warning. They see the conditions developing and they have to give warning, but nature of weather means it slows or speeds up, gains or loses power, misses your state or hits you head on.That's what this was...like all the elements of a super hurricane...but needing time to watch, get data, while telling people to prepare to leave town if the signal is given.This flu didn't pop up when we all heard it on the news...they have been watching the mutations of avian and swine and concern was growing. If you talk to most scientists in this field, over the past three years, it is not IF, but WHEN. A global and catastrophic pandemic is considered inevitable by most virologists. It is looking a little better now that this is probably not IT.And this is NOT a regular flu virus. With regular flu viruses we all have some immunity recognition. Luckily, and so far, it has been mild, but from a scientific standpoint, they are not getting cocky because mutations are expected and not enough data are in. The elements for this to become something globally serious are still there.I think that so much of the public had a poor science education ( I sure did...very ignorant about science until two of my kids became science nerds and pre-med and I went for masters in nursing) and didn't understand what the experts were saying.Two sentence, both are true:1. This flu seems to be manifesting as no more serious than seasonal flu.2. This flu is unlike any seasonal flu.Science is a language of distinctions and if the public takes away, ""Oh, this is just another seasonal flu....the concern was unfounded...scaremongers.."" then they just didn't get it.If the public took away, ""OMG, we're gonna die, lock the doors, it's coming""....then they just didn't get it.There are going to be other stories like this. Whenever the story sounds big or scary, that is especially the time for NOT listening to headlines (like the sensationalist ones of Drudge or Huffpost)....but sticking to the sober news outlets and the direct sources (CDC)."
we were supposed to leave today so I am all depressed that we can't go. I hate the stupid tour company for canceling all of the vacations. :(
"The important thing to track is the rate of new infections and the daily death rate, these tell you all you need to know. Total counts mean nothing as they will always be growing as they don't exactly take the 'previously ill' off the roster. These have been dropping substantially since the beginning of the week, almost as quickly as we found out there was a new flu strain. In a real epidemic with real consequence, these will both be rising, often dramatically whereas with this, both rates have been dropping quickly. Yes, something could change, but it seems unlikely. This thing will have to mutate again to become a serious threat. Of course, this is of little comfort to the Mexicans here who have lost a loved one, but the rest of us can kick back, smoke a cigar and sip a tequila for the time being."
"avocado...I'm sorry.What a drag. The timing was bad. You must have been right in that window..that five or so days when it was so unclear. And on the nerdier side....Many countries are not set up to track disease, especially when not looking for it. One of the unknowns is how many actually had it in Mexico. If it was rampant in Mexico, hundreds of thousands or millions, as WHO wonders, and due to mildness, lack of health access and just assuming it was the end of flu season illness...well, that would put those Mexican deaths in proportion. A few deaths out of a huge number is not a big deal.Whenever you look at ""confirmed"" cases, especially in developing world, you surmise the actual number is many,many times that, because most people would not have gone to the doctor and most doctors would not have been taking samplings and sending them to CDC labs, etc...WHO is going to take test samplings to get an idea how widespread this flu was in Mexico. A while back they did a blood study on people who had been alive in 1918 and found 97% had contracted it and that literally translated to about a 100% infection rate.There is always a percentage of people who get a virus but are without symptom...like 20%...carriers. "
"I found this interesting:No rationale for travel restrictions1 May 2009 -- WHO is not recommending travel restrictions related to the outbreak of the influenza A(H1N1) virus. Today, international travel moves rapidly, with large numbers of individuals visiting various parts of the world. Limiting travel and imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading, but would be highly disruptive to the global community. Influenza A(H1N1) has already been confirmed in many parts of the world. The focus now is on minimizing the impact of the virus through the rapid identification of cases and providing patients with appropriate medical care, rather than on stopping its spread internationally. Furthermore, although identifying the signs and symptoms of influenza in travellers can be an effective monitoring technique, it is not effective in reducing the spread of influenza as the virus can be transmitted from person to person before the onset of symptoms. Scientific research based on mathematical modelling indicates that restricting travel will be of limited or no benefit in stopping the spread of disease. Historical records of previous influenza pandemics, as well as experience with SARS, have validated this point. Travellers can protect themselves and others by following simple recommendations related to travel aimed at preventing the spread of infection. Individuals who are ill should delay travel plans and returning travellers who fall ill should seek appropriate medical care. These recommendations are prudent measures which can limit the spread of many communicable diseases and not only influenza A(H1N1)."
"Many people do not fully comprehend the geographical location and isolation of Los Cabos. Did you know that the closest reports of ""possible"" Swine Flu are 1,000+ miles by car from Los Cabos? Depending where you may live in the United States (or elsewhere) in the world, geographically speaking, you may be far SAFER in Los Cabos. In fact, Los Cabos is so isolated from Mexico's mainland, that news travels quite slow to us here! But we've caught wind of the hype, and we want to assure regular Cabo visitors and even our Cabo neighbors that this swine flu thing may not be as widespread as the U.S. and world media are portraying it right now. For example, the media says things like ""Mexico"" when referring to a city or state no matter where it is in Mexico. When the ""world media gods"" report cases in San Diego or LA, why don't they simply say ""United States,"" as they do when reporting on isolated cities in Mexico? We are unsure why the world media's standards and ethics allow for such lax labeling of Mexico, yet standards remain strict and detailed in reports about the U.S.. Frankly, this irresponsible misreporting of Cabo is quite frustrating source:Derrick Grahnwww.hautter.comhttp://www.hautter.com/facts-about-swine-flu"
"I hope all of you that had your travel agencies, airlines, cruise ships and charters screw you out of your dream vacation in Cabo are letting them know about it. Did you let yours know, avocado? There are 2 confirmed cases in Vancouver, but none in Cabo. Makes a lot of sense to cancel everyone's vacations to H1N1-free Cabo and force them to stay home in H1N1-infested Vancouver.Perhaps if the customers exert enough pressure on the cruise lines, agencies, etc they will re-institute the routes sooner. Right now I'm hearing the whole month of May will be off limits to many people - and for no reason.I've already written to the CDC - they're telling people not to go to Mexico, but are allowing Mexicans freely to travel into the USA, against the strong urging and advice of the WHO who says travel restrictions to Mexico make no sense. Hopefully some of you will join me. Perhaps a note to Fox News to let them know how happy you are with the accuracy of their reporting through this as well..."
"I'll bet the travel groups had people calling to cancel and then the fear was the trips would not be profitable enough.I'll bet it was a business decision.WHO and CDC NEVER called for travel restrictions and kept shooting down any notion of border closings.I really think the public has to take a lot of responsibility for NOT listening to the experts...for reading things in that weren't there. Even the sensationalist headlines...if you went and read the article, you'd often see the headline didn't match the article.For travel there needed to be a ""wait and see"" except for the trips scheduled to leave last week. That was the week when it was a difficult decision."
"Hello I just got an email from cabo and they said 4 people are in the hospital and there are probably more waking around,(swine flu) I was suppose to go down to my houuse and she said wait. So if I hear any more I will let you knowGood Luck "
Hi there are 4 cases in cabo and they are in the hospital. sorry
"I'm sorry, but I don't believe the 4 cases in Cabo. Do you have a link you can provide? "
"I can not give you her email address but this is what she wrote, and I do not think a dr. would lieHi friends, We have just been informed through our doctor that there are four cases of Swine Flu here in Cabo. All four infected people are in the hospitals here, but there may be more sick people out there walking around.  SO PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS. WEAR YOUR MASKS, WASH YOUR HANDS AND STAY AWAY FROM PUBLIC PLACES. We love you all and want you safe. Lin, Juan and Juanito"
"Anything's possible, but there's nothing on the news that I've been able to find and the phone would be ringing off the hook if anyone in the grapevine had heard anything. Even so, it takes time to confirm the new virus. I'd be *very* cautious about posting this at this point, because I'd say the chances are more than even that it will turn out to be untrue. If there's any truth to it, it's probably a few people that have an elevated temperature and they're being checked out to make sure it's not this flu. "
"Also, there's been quite a few, even dozens, of 'reported' cases and/or false positives that turned out not to be this flu in the US and these actually made the news. ""I know someone who knows someone who heard from a colleague that......."" isn't terribly reliable info, especially since no one else is claiming the same information. "
"Speaking of false positives, my wife told me that there were several people investigated for the flu because of the symptoms and it turned out to be dengue. Dengue is a bit more severe, to say the least, than this little flu bug and is a constant, but low density disease here in BCS and other parts of Mexico."
"cabo girlmy wifes best friend is the doctor XXXXXX(last name ) ,who is on charge of the ER every night,at the IMSS(Mexican Institute of Social Security)in Cabo,and we got true information from them everyday, until now THERES NOT ANY SINGLE CASE CONFIRMED in Cabo.mau"
"Plus, if my spanish is correct, the actual number of confirmed, rather than 'could be' cases of this strain of flu, nationwide, is just over 400 with 16 deaths. Not the thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths reported (now attributable to other causes). No deaths in two days and the situation considered to be stable. Enough so that Mexico is lashing out at all the countries over reacting to the situation. "
"Here's where you can find up to the moment numbers - …salud.gob.mx/contenidos/…estadisticas.html11 cases in Baja California [Norte], but that's not Baja California Sur."
"Cabogirl58People´s vacations, people´s health and people´s jobs depend on accurate information. I´m not saying it can´t be true but I´ll wait to hear this from official news sources. I hope everyone else will too"
And my BFF's hubby is a Dr. here in Cabo; no cases at this time.
"I think it is really likely the swine flu has ALREADY been widespread in Mexico, including Cabo, but was not differentiated from seasonal flu and for most people showed up as mild.CDC and WHO are thinking a big reason the fatality numbers looked so scary is because most flu cases occurred under the radar. A few dozen deaths in young people right when a new flu strikes is worrisome. But, hundreds of thousands of cases with new flu and ONLY a few dozen deaths is not so worrisome.So, maybe it has mostly come and gone in Cabo?"
Everyone with flu like symptoms that have gone to see a doctor has been tested and they all come back negative. Very little regular flu here at the moment...
"First of all... I and my family are in Cabo now. Secondly, if you ever want to be here when it is not crowded and the weather is beautiful and the airlines are not jam packed and clearing immigration and customs takes no more than ten minutes... you should come now!!!No apparent cases of flu in Cabo and things seem fine. The only problem is the night life is a bit slow, but the beaches are not crowded, the cruise ships aren't stopping and all is well.Be here another couple of weeks and ""wish you were here""... kinda.DS"
i just received an email from pueblo bonito stating there are NO cases in Cabo...i will copy it and put in the forum if you like
"We head to Cabo two weeks from today. We are excited and no fear whatsoever. There are more cases of the flu here ... one case ... than in Cabo so I will probably be 100% safer in Cabo than here in Omaha. Of course, this being our first time in Cabo I will probably be spoiled by the lack of crowds!"
yes place the article on the server so people will start getting back in to the travel mode. Thanks for that.
"here is the email ........STATE OFBAJA CALIFORNIA SUR REMAINS FREE OF THE SWINE FLU VIRUS. NO CONFIRMED CASES NEITHER REGISTERED NOR SUSPECTED. STATE TOURISM SECRETARY ALBERTO TREVIÑO DECLARED THAT THE ENTITY IS VIRUS-FREE.Baja California Sur is free of the swine flu virus; thus far there have been no confirmed cases nor are there any suspected cases statewide. Baja California Sur Secretary of Tourism Alberto Treviño stated that residents, domestic and international tourists may stay and visit the state’s tourist destinations with the security of knowing that throughout the state there are no cases of swine flu. Those tourists who are planning to visit our tourist destinations may do so without worrying about contracting the swine flu virus, and with the knowledge that state health authorities are working to maintain this controlled situation.During the Touristic Tianguis being held in Acapulco, Guerrero, Treviño said that “the tourism sector in Baja California Sur is operating normally and with the security that there are no precedents of the virus in any part of the state: from Guerrero Negro to Ciudad Constitución, from La Paz to Todos Santos and from Los Barriles to Cabo San Lucas”. Treviño added that “the tourism industry in Baja California Sur is undoubtedly one of the principal driving forces of the state’s economy, due to the teamwork of the business sector, society and government. For that reason, today more than ever all of us in Baja California Sur are working together in a responsible manner to improve the touristic development of our state”.The Tourism Secretary reiterated that in his state, there is not even a suspicion of this virus, in that health authorities have sent ten samples from patients with common cold symptoms to Mexico City for analysis, and in each of the cases the result was negative. Even so, he emphasized that all precautions are being undertaken as a preventative measure, and that careful observation is underway at marine, ground and air terminals. Public and private schools have been closed, and the public has been warned against gathering in large crowds and in enclosed spaces. As a further preventive measure, Treviño said that health officials have enough medicine and 120 special reagents in their possession to treat the disease in state health centers and hospitals. He therefore insisted that his state is free of the virus."
total agree with taccabo about the post of cabogirl58mau
"Cabogirl was right about one part. There are 4 identified and announced flu cases, but its not swine flu. Type A. That's the problem with inside information, it often is incomplete. "
"Wow, we are in the same boat scheduled to go to the same place and same week. My wife and I have decided to go. Our thoughts are that from what we understand the flu has not spread from Mexico City to the outer edges such as Baja as badly as it has spread to the states. Our other concern was getting stuck down there should we get sick but that does not look like something that they are going to do. I hope we are making the right decision!"
Still no swine flu in the entire state of Baja California Sur (where Cabo is). Relax and have a great time.
"And even if there were, as in Mexico City, your chances of getting it is less than 1 in 25,000 and your chances of dying from it are maybe 1 in 1,000,000. Of course, people think these are good odds for winning the lottery so YMMV."
"Just returned and its was great. No flu reported any where near Cabo. I drove by two Hospitals everyday for a week and never was it ""busy"" It's a shame that people are not enjoying Cabo because of this flu. I brought my 4 year old and mother and never had a concern. We were smart about it and had med's and always washing hands. It was so quiet downtown and the resorts are empty. I took the family to a ""big"" Cinco de Mayo party last night and had a great time. Do not cancel/delay your trip, it is claen and very safe. I live in San Diego, we have more flu here than all of Baja. Worst thing that can happen is you get the flu, its just a flu. My doc said no more lethal than any other."
I'm hoping all this panic will get me a upgrade on my room at Del Arco and possibly a nice first class upgrade on my flight!I can't wait I leave on Friday the 15th!!!!
"johnash....where did you get those figures....no one has those figures. What we have right now is a lot of unknowns, but with what we do know, travel restrictions should not be in place. Travel and wash your hands is the current recommendation. That is all we know.Just today figures came out from epidemiologists of a possible scenario of swine flu infecting 2 billion people.That would be one end of the scenario spectrum and the other end would be this flu going away quietly."
Thanks for that update - just as I suspected. I leave Sunday for Cabo and am really looking forward to 7 days of fun and hope that I can get an upgrade as well on our room.Thanks again for posting since you are back.
"I hear ya! We leave on the 14th for a week...staying at Melia Cabo Real.....we got a call from US Airways saying that because of so many cancellation they are consolidating their flights, so ours is the only flight out that day! Hopefully we too will get a good upgrade on both flight and room! Have Lots of fun! We plan to!....of course, the couple going with us postponed yesterday and are not going until October.....bummer."
"All the evidence says, ""Travel to and from Cabo is fine."" But, this report underlies one of several reasons this flu has garnered so much attention and caution and why the world will continue to monitor it (and why the popular notion that this was MAINLY media-hype and over-zealous scientists is not founded...sure, there was some of that....)…yahoo.com/s/…med_swine_flu_bird_flu_4It is very reassuring to me that experts are watching so that I don't have to be concerned. Go Public Health! And, everyone have a great time in Cabo!I was there last month and I'm going again in October. "
I'm leaving on Monday & expect to have a GREAT time- I live in San Diego & there are more people here sick that in Cabo- Party on!!!
Yep - we will all be partying on!!!
we're leaving on may 22. can't wait!!!! from all indications everything looks fine!!! six of us will be partying it up. 
check this interview youcabo.com/video/225/Cabo-travelers-testimo…
"Just had two friends get back from Cabo. No problems from them and so far, no reported cases of swine flu in Cabo. I changed my ticket back to Cabo from the Bahamas. Looking forward to partying there this upcoming Saturday. :)"
"I just got back from Cabo last night, greatest trip ever. It was sunny and beautiful.At the SJD airport, we had to fill out a small form and answer a few question (do we have a fever, have we come in contact with animals, etc). And when we hand the form over to the security guard to get a stamp of approval there was a thermal camera what we had to walk pass.Other then this extra process, getting in and out of the airport was easy."
Just got back from spending a week in Cabo. Very quiet their. It was a nice relaxing week - but would have been nice to see more people. Prices very high as they are hurting financially. Met some locals and they said the same thing the economy and the swine flu has really hurt them financially. Felt bad that a cruise ship came in and refused to let anyone off as the locals were all happy and looking forward to the business. You had to pay to get through the gates at the various docks - they are struggling. The good news is there is no swine flu their - I did not even see one person with a runny nose . . . very good news for the locals.
"That cruise ship was a private ship that is basically luxury apartments that travel from port to port. They DID allow passengers off, but only a few came into town.No one charges to walk onto the docks. The docks are all considered private. There is however, a tax for passengers on charter and party boats.There has only been 5 cases of flu in general in the Los Cabos area. The flu does not thrive in tropical regions; it is too hot and humid here 90% of the year. Usually, if someone gets the flu (any variation of it) it is because they recently traveled to a cooler region and brought it back with them. As already stated, one case was swine out of those 5 cases, she has since recovered and never required hospitalization. She fell ill at the end of April (we only learned of it recently and there is a thread that talks about it), and being that there has not been any additional cases, it may have just ended with her because again, our climate doesn't suite influenza.I think it's funny when people from Sacramento (as an example) ask if we have this strain, when countless cases have been reported there!Again, it's hot and humid...we are all good here!"
"That was an intersting response to my post - that I did have a wonderful time; however, prices are high and yes they did charge to enter the dock . . . $2.00 perhaps a tax but it was called an entry fee - even the signage on the docks refers to an entry fee. I met several locals that reside in Cabo and they all told me the same thing . . . as a matter of fact they did say that The World Cruise ship did not allow most passengers entry. Yes, locals were trying to rip off tourists as well as our resort the Play Grande . . . you had to be really careful, watch your bill and pay attention in town regarding partying and purchases. Three ladies that were on our party boat ""La Princessa"" did book it and ended up paying again at the boat as the person took their money and failed to report it to the boat that they did indeed pay - we talked about it and I told them lesson learned. The Jungle boat that we intially booked through our resort the Playa Grande attempted to do that to us as they decided not to go out that day and keep our money; however, our resort credited it back to us when I complained and we then took the La Princessa, which was fabulous. When and if I ever go back . . . I would not take the Jungle Tour or the Jungle boat. Some of the locals were very rude - but for the most part mostly nice. I purchased a time share - which I decided I would use elsewhere. I did not notice as an individual any swine flu symptom with anyone their . . . but did believe there may have been a case or two . . . did not bother me in the least. We wanted to help support the economy in Cabo - but were semi shocked with the locals, prices and some of the things going on. I would not recommend to any of my friends to go back - has nothing to do with the flu - but treatment of Americans. I was going to keep this to myself, but your post irritated me when you tried to discount things. That is how our trip was really...but we made the best time possible out of it!!"
"The comment about the flu (and my entire post actually) was not directed at you. I am sorry (and shocked) if you felt that I was discounting your post when in fact I was only trying to help clarify the private cruise ship, and the $2.00 tax. I am very sad to hear that you were taken advantage of. I know most of the owners for the companies that you mentioned and while it will not change your experience here, I will let them know that their staff has ruined not just the reputation of their companies, but of Cabo San Lucas as a whole."
Thanks - and I think they need to know about theses situations. This will be my last post. Take care and I truly hope things improve for the Cabo residence . . . as I feel bad for what everyone is going through.
We were just in Cabo from the 14th to the 22nd. It was very quiet but no signs of illness or worry anywhere. If anything we got great service and deals because it was so quiet.   GO GO GO! Will deffo go again. Beautiful 
"a group of six of us just got back on the 29th from cabo. so glad we didn't change our plans. everything was great. no signs of illness anywhere. according to the gringo gazette they never had any swine flu there. weather was perfect, people were fabulous and so friendly. great deals to be had because tourism has taken a big hit. cruise ships starting to return while we were there."
"It is refreshing to see cooler heads prevailing and good reports from those returing from the Cabo area that confirm what most of us realized all the while.To refresh:1) Swine Flu = Flu, not bubonic plauge or ebola, the flu. A relative of mine is a doctor, specifically a lung doctor and he is bringing his family and 3 young children to Cabo in 2 weeks and couldn't be the least bit worried.2) This is not a ""Mexican"" problem, it is everywhere and if anything has very much died down in the parts of Mexico where it appears to have originated from. The US is home to hundreds of cases right now and you don't hear people asking if it is safe to visit NYC.....3) Yes people have died from H1N1, specifically 116 worldwide (www.who.int/csr/don/2009_06_01a/en/index.html) remember, roughly the same amount die each day in the US from auto accidents. Are you going to stop driving now?"
Just wear a stinkin mask!
"I'm still conflicted. My fiancee and I are from St. Louis are supposed to honeymoon in Cabo next month...but the only H1N1 death in Missouri was a man who went to Cabo in April (news link below):…stltoday.com/articles/…0527ovl-flu.txtBased on everybody's responses here, I think we'd really enjoy the trip down there since neither of has have ever been. However, the fact that the only person from my area who has died from swine flu was someone who went to Cabo bothers me somewhat.I'm a physician so I probably see more sick people now every day than I ever would in Cabo. But I haven't heard anybody on this forum discuss the fact that someone died of H1N1 after visting Cabo (although i know there's no proof he contracted the virus in Mexico). Any thoughts out there? I'd hate to change my plans out of an irrational fear. Thanks!"
"I live here full time. The people who live here, both Mexicans and expats, are robustly healthy. When I moved to Cabo, my allegies went away, my aches and pains went away, some other health issues went away, and I have never been sick, even one day, since moving here three years ago. This is a contrast to my days in California. Could it be the jalapeno peppers and fresh fish? I have to be honest with you though. I did forget to put on my sunscreen today and got way to much sun. Not good.I am not a medical professional, but my daughter is. She visits 2 or 3 times a year. She says screw the reports, she needs a Cabo fix. I recommend that you come and enjoy yourself. In my opinion, you have a greater chance of getting sick in your hometown than you do here. Your biggest danger here is getting ""Cabo Fever."" This is a malady whereby you return home and start making plans for your next trip down and start marking the days off on a calendar. You start dreaming about fish tacos and an ice cold beverage. You greet your co-workers with ""buenos dias."" You can't get Cabo off your mind. This is highly contagious!"
"Good god, are we still talking about this?!? I thought maybe I was missing some good swine flu jokes or something, but this is almost disturbing as it's borderline pathological. Again, you are far more likely to be sickened or die in Cabo from - killer wavesdrinking tainted water from a tapscorpionsjelly fishsting ray infectionbeing buried too deeply in the sandthe floors in the mallbeing hit while crossing the streettoo much boozaholgetting smacked by the tail of a large sea mammalguava allergy (not kidding, I'm just lucky I only had a very small amount or lord knows what it might have done to me!)bad driversyour own bad drivinga nagging wife while drivingtrying to ride a Harley or scooter because it looks easyscuba divingfalling off a boat'curvas peligrosas'Did I miss anything?

"Oh, yeah - hurricanesearthquakespalm tree grove firesfalling into an unmarked holetripping on the sidewalkslipping in the hotel showerhanging yourself in the closet because you have to return to real life (RIP David Carradine, we love, but WTF?!?)"
"And AirBuses. There's something wrong with those things that scares me a lot more than any flu. You're also numerically far more likely to die at the hands of your spouse while on vacation. Especially while boating, relaxing on a balcony or scuba diving. Somehow, that all seemed too politically incorrect, but it's the Tecate speaking."
"John, I think you covered just about everything! LOLBy the way, if it was you asking about the sauerkraut, if you have a CCC in La Paz, I found canned sauerkraut in our CCC on the isle with the olives, dry bread crumbs and instant gravies. THIS, is what the locals worry about. HA!I know some are still concerned. The thing is, and i have said it a gazillion times before: Cabo is 50 miles south of the tropic of cancer. It's too hot and humid here for the flu. Yes, we get it but not nearly as many cases as in the States or other parts of Mexico.It is more likely to catch the flu on the plane coming back from Cabo, than while actually here. Also, flu season is OVER. Anyone catching the flu at this point would be unlikely.(I can't believe I just bumped this thread)."
"I can't believe you bumped it either ;^) I did find the sauerkraut at one CCC but not the other. One is geared more towards Americans because of location. We'll be serving sauerkraut dogs and pork/sauerkraut at the restaurant starting Tuesday! I haven't figured out how to delicately explain to Mexicans the possible side effects of pork and sauerkraut, but I'm working on it. "
I just landed in NY back from Cabo THERE IS NO SWINE FLU THERE AT ALL!I will write a full report of my trip tommorow....stayed at the ME resort!
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! ""I'm worried about Swine Flu becasue ONE person died who may or may not have caught it in Cabo""Honesly, read that again and ask yourself how insane that sounds. One person. Get a god damn grip and realize what a non-issue this is. "
"I just got back from Cabo and I got the flu. Note: the flu and not swine flu. I was mildly sick for one day and then was fine the next. Apparently, I didn't get it in Cabo, but from a passenger next to me in Dallas during my layover. My point with this post is that if it is going to happen, it will and all the hand sanitizer in the world is not going to prevent it."
