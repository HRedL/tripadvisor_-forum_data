May I know some links or websites to find information in either English or Chinese for all the conditions ?
Below are links to several sites that provide country travel restrictions. Just scroll down to their China or Mainland China section for current restrictions. International Air Transport Association (IATA) : https:/…1580226297.htmTrip.com (AKA Ctrip):  https:/…Cathay Pacific Airlines:  https://tinyurl.com/y74vothgPandemic International SOS:  https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/2019-n…
"I saw news China is moving to allowing visitors from South Korea maybe few others. Not yet, but moving towards that. South Koreans are the No.1 foreigners population in China, and they did well on Covid19."
"Yes, China will allow South Korea people in the later future, but RNA test still needed..."
"The Korean exemption is actually from 1 May, but it is only for Korean nationals traveling to China for business purposes who qualify for special ""fast-track"" immigration clearance. If curious, you can find all the details by going to the Trip.com link in post #1 and scroll down to the mainland China section. Korean's traveling for tourism are treated same as all the other foreign nationals."
"If you have a completely new Chinese visa signed after Apr.28, it's ok for you to enter PRC."
