"Hello, I am flying to Dominica and need to stop off in Barbados en route. Where can you get a test please in Barbados independently as I need one ahead of moving onto Dominica. Thank you"
You can get one arranged by calling the local COVID-19 hotline. Local number is 536-4500Regards
"With the whole of last BA flight from the UK having to be quarantined because some people didn't bother to get tested before they flew and one tested here was positive,I suggest you do everyone on your flight and everyone living here, a favour , and have a test in the UK before you fly to Barbados.Edited: 9:33 am, July 20, 2020 "
HI. Westiegal: I just sent you a PM.
"Vaulting, if you are flying in from the U.K. get tested before you fly to Barbados. Don’t take the risk of infecting fellow passengers and crew.Also,If you were to test positive on Barbados you will be quarantined in a government facility until you test negative, that could be weeks not days.It’s not worth the risk."
I have replied Mel
Vaulting if you are just connecting at BGI for Dominica you will not have the results in time.
Agree you should be getting g a test before getting on any planeWe are in a pandemic .... it would be the best thing to do rather than waitingGood luck
I know for sure that the test administered at the Barbados Defence Force Base at Paragon is acceptable for travel to other Caribbean territories. They will issue a certificate that you travel with. Results take 24 hours usually. You have to call and tell them when you are traveling to Dominica and they will give you a date and time to come for the test. The certificate will be sent via email. This assumes you will be in Barbados for a few days.
I certainly intend to have the test beforehand. Not liking the idea that BA are not doing their checks before people leave the UK.
Super thank you
"@vaulting...You said ""Not liking the idea that BA are not doing their checks before people leave the UK."" But there is no obligation on the airline to do any health checks or to mandate that people are covid negative before they fly.Why would you presume otherwise? I appreciate its a confusing situation but the mess is coming from Barbados. Mia appears to be pandering to her electorate. What they really need is some joinwd up thinking and a plan that does not keep changing. This is not a BA issue.Edited: 12:46 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"""Mia is pandering to her electorate "" ???? I prefer to call it Mia trying to keep her people safe and especially her huge population of elderly people from dying as a result of this horrible Pandemic ."
"To add, I really don't understand why Mia cannot just say, no Negative test, no flight to Barbados. Full Stop."
"That is exactly what she should have said Westie, but she didn't and still hasn't.It is not BA's responsibility to police covid testing for Barbados but if BAs policy is masks/shield in the plane like Air Csnada's, then the FAs should have enforced it."

"Westie , Mia is walking a tightrope. Yes she wants to keep the island safe but she knows she needs the income from tourism as well. She cant have both 100% and needs to find a way to earn enough income without disenfranchising her voters.She speaks very well and I have listened to her and read transcripts and she is pushing against an open door with her electorate. She ( like most politicians ) says the right things and pushes the right buttons but appearing resolute against the rest of the world wont get her far other than re-elected.The island nation mentality is all well and good but it wont keep the lights on. Your ecomomy will tank, unemployment with go through the roof. The current plan is stupid, she needs to insist people are negative before they fly, that can be passed onto the airlines to administer with a fit to fly certificate.Pulling up the drawbridge wont work. Quarantining a whole plane because of one positive case wont work. It might get her re-elected but its hardly smart business. From over here she is pandering, if course youre sacred - but your countries indicisevness wont help.Letting the virus in wont win her votes of course but long term the economic fall out will be worse than covid unless she makes some tough choices."
"To be fair only for reading this forum did I know of all the protocols for entering Barbados, unfortunately not everyone reads TA. I wouldn’t have know about having a test before I arrived In Barbados. I don’t blame Mia, I wish the UK had been more vigilant"
@Canby what if the airline had not been advised to carry out these checks?
I believe the airlines have a responsibility to their customers. Initially when booking they should send an additional email as well as your booking confirmation. Stating the current rules and letting people know that they are likely to change- for the country for the country one is traveling to and stating what is expected from you the traveler as far as personal responsibility. A reminder email 24 hours before travel as well. Or at the very least directions or links to the info. Someone needs to make sure people know to look into this stuff. Airlines need to take some accountability.
Lol @ Canby but very true.
"How could BA know what was required when the rules and even definition of words was changing on Fri. and the flight was Sat., right?I knew airlines were responsible for checking visa, passsport, legal stuff etc but didn't know they also had to check medical requirements as well.AC still has nothing up for Barbados. Guess they still haven't received a readable document."
Well if airlines want people to buy their plane tickets and travel...and be returning customers they better all start communicating efficiently. There has to be some way they can all work together.
Actually BA do not have to make sure you have the proper documents with you .You have to make sure of that.Check out # 13 of their statement of Carriage.https:/…general-conditions-of-carriage
Yes the visa would not be issued without proof of the neg PCR. We are not there yet. So the airline would be asking for passport and visa.
"Point is, Barbados has not made a PCR test a requirement for entry. They only suggest you have a test done but if not they will test you at BGI. Therefore the airline would not care if you have been tested or not. Not their problem.Edited: 5:14 pm, July 20, 2020 "
the air lines shouldn't allowed anyone on the plane without showing the results of the PCR Test...
"Dale, if Barbados would require a neg covid test for entry and not iffer testing at BGI there wouldn't be any untested passengers on the plane."
"""Latest"" on getting PCR tests in Barbados. Went this AM to get mine done. Go to the Warren Polyclinic in Warren St. Michaels (also known as Eunice Gibson Polyclinic). No appointment neccessary. Clinic opens @ 9am. You'll want to be there by 8:30 to join the line. DON'T wait with the big crowd. The Covid testing is done at the side door -- the one closest to the highway. Took about 2-1/2 hours once they opened (I was 9th in line).I'm told my results will be emailed to me by 10am tomorrow. Clinic phone number is 536-4000 or 536-4036."
"Brian if you get it on time pleae let us know. And if so...would that the UK, Canada and the USA be as efficient. If it were the case, then there would be no problem in insisting that everyone had the paperwork when flying. As it is, almost one in 3 of my clients has the test done but does not get the results in time for the flight - and I gather from my contacts in Canada and the US that it is even slower there. It has got slightly better in the past two to three weeks but not enough."
