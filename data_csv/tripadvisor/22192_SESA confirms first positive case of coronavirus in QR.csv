It was bound to happen they will only get more as time goes by.
"Riviera Maya News report...https:/…2020.htmlQuoteThe first two cases of coronavirus confirmed for Yucatan PeninsulaBy Riviera Maya News on March 14, 2020Merida, Yucatan — The Secretary of Health for Yucatan, Mauricio Sauri Vivas, confirmed Friday afternoon the first case of coronavirus in Yucatan. The news was made public at a press conference in the Government Palace.Sauri Viva said the confirmed carrier of the virus is a 57-year-old female who had traveled to Europe. The woman reportedly traveled to Madrid and began to exhibit symptoms upon her return. He says there are three other suspected cases currently under evaluation.Cancun, Q.R. — Hours later, the Ministry of Health of Quintana Roo also announced it’s first and only positive case of coronavirus. Alejandra Aguirre, head of the health unit, did not provide any details of the patient, only saying that the case was detected in the municipality of Benito Juárez.Through social media, state governor Carlos Joaquín González said “The first case of # COVID_19 in #QuintanaRoo has been confirmed. The patient is isolated and under correct treatment. We are vigilant and the situation is under control.”At a press conference, José Luis Alomía, director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health and government spokesman for coronavirus reported that on March 13, 11 new cases were confirmed around the country, bringing the total number to 26 positive cases of COVID-19 in Mexico.He added that in addition to the 26 confirmed cases, there are 105 suspected cases and 344 negative cases.

Report about the lack of prevention protocols at Cancun airport...https:/…
Here's a link to the Statement by Cancun's President. Unfortunately Por Esto has reset their website so I can't cut and paste the article in English any longer so you'll have to translate this:https:/…
"Although none of the article's state what part of Benito Juarez the confirmed case is located in, my understanding is that it was detected at Hospital General here in Cancun."
"The report in Post #3 states the person is a 71-year-old woman of Italian nationality who had travelled to Italy. The virus carrier as well as all her contacts are in social isolation, and will be kept under observation for 14 days.Many of the confirmed cases in Mexico are linked to travel to Italy.Edited: 1:17 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Mexico has suspended school for one month. They are extending the normal Semana Santa school break. The last day of classes is March 20 with a return on April 20. https:/…
"#5, just FYI a loose translation is: they have the first positive test in QR, the people in contact with the patient have already been located and diagnosed with no symptoms (this is the 71-year-old Italian woman in Benito Juarez, the article does not say if the people in contact with her were tested). There are two confirmed cases on the Peninsula. (The Mexican woman with covid from the Yucatan is 57, and she got it on a trip to Spain.) The mayor says to wash your hands, don’t touch your face and leave your clothes out in the sun for at least two hours before washing them."
Well now ~ obviously this was inevitable. Without a doubt (my own) there are more cases lingering about the region.
"MisterB and Joan, thank you for the updated information. Appreciate all the linked sources. Much appreciated. Of course, very sorry to hear this. Hope you can all remain safe and healthy."
"You're more than welcome, SunSeeker. You stay well and healthy too."
"You're welcome, Sunseeker.It's life as usual here in Playa. Lots of toilet paper in the grocery store.Edited: 9:43 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Joan and Mister, I would also like to thank you for your contributions. They are helpful. A word of warning, should you chose to listen. I see a ton of similarities between MX and the US in their response to this. First and Foremost is the complete lack of testing. You only need to look at the US to see what is coming, as we here in the US are watching Italy to predict our countries next move. I am currently in the Philadelphia suburbs. Today started what they are calling a ""shut down"" ordered by our state Governor. Simply put, you are not allowed out of the house except to see doctors, hospitals, pharmacy or groceries. We woke up this morning to an announcement that said please abide by the shut down orders so they do not have to enforce a real quarantine order. Everything is closed, even the liquor stores! So please stock up on essential supplies. Get yourselves ready for what is almost certainly going to move your way. Because when this blows over, we are coming to Mexico and I along with many others will need your advice and on the ground reports! Stay safe and be prepared!"
"You're welcome, justinkinne. And I am aware of what might happen. We just have to be prepared."
"You're welcome, justinkinne. I know what might be ahead for us here and I think I'm pretty much prepared. I bought my stock of antibacterial a few days ago. And I'm glad I did because when I went to the store they were out of just about anything antibacterial. Some stores have signs up saying they're o noting purchase of e choice items to 3 per family, but the shelf s are empty."
"Update...""Governor updates state’s positive cases to four""Source: https:/…2020.htmlBy Riviera Maya News on March 17, 2020Cancun, Q.R. — Governor Carlos Joaquín has addressed the state with an update confirming a total of four positive cases of coronavirus in Quintana Roo. The four cases were part of the state’s 43 suspected cases of which 21 came back negative, while 18 remain unknown. He says laboratory tests are still out on those 18 cases.In his address, he explained “In Quintana Roo, we are still in Phase 1 of the care models established by the World Health Organization, which is called viral import. This means that the virus cases we are detecting were caught out of state, while people were in one of the countries that were having outbreaks at the time.“This scenario still allows us to continue carrying out public activities, but with important prevention recommendations,” he added.“We are strengthening epidemiological surveillance in ports, airports, bus terminals, and border bridges in Belize with more personnel from the international health area, who are reviewing those who arrive at the entity.”Also, we are making sure that at these entry points there are the essential cleaning and hygiene material so that all passengers can use them. We have already installed infrared thermal cameras for the detection of people who could enter the state with symptoms of some respiratory disease.Although there are criticisms of this measure, which according to the World Health Organization has a reduced percentage of effectiveness, I have considered its use as one more measure to increase supervisory capacity. We will not skimp on technological and human resources for the protection of health.We are also applying questionnaires to each of the passengers and visitors about their health status in order to have strategic information about the conditions that each one has and then be able to make decisions regarding their entry.I want to comment that the secretaries of health and tourism will continue to update the information continuously and permanently."

I have bottles containing 5% solutions of alcohol and taking it internally -- seems to be working :-)
I should have been clearer. The end solution needs to be 60% alcohol or better. The recipe I will start with is 2/3 cup alcohol and 1/3 cup aloe. I need to start with 90% or higher alcohol...which is gone from the shelves.

"""So with this and other reports, tourism is deemed more important than public safety, and international flights are allowed - nay encouraged - to continue...amazing...we feel safe.""Sadly I have to say I agree. But really if you know anything about Mexico's current President this shouldn't shock you.He refuses to use hand gel (in fact makes a huge show out of refusing it), continues holding rallies and greeting people with handshakes, hugs and kisses, carries a U.S. $2 bill and says that will protect him from the virus. He continues to downplay the seriousness of this and has referred to the closure of schools as a vacation to enjoy. And though not related to the virus, don't even get me started on his asinine policy of ""hugs not bullets"" for drug dealers."

Mister ~ why do you think there are no details?
"I can only guess. You'll have to ask the person who wrote the report.Edited: 10:27 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"I am so sad reading any of these threads about Corona. I think Joan is right, the lack of tests right now will cause the numbers to literally explode overnight when test kits do show up. It will be a pandemic within a week when this starts. This will devastate Mexico. I hope our favorite waiters, waitresses, restaurants and store owners are still healthy and around when I return."
There’s a lack of tests all over the world. Is this new news? No.
They are hoping to start testing 25 thousand people a day soon in the Uk . Having plenty of time on my hands I worked out that to test everyone at that rate it will take seven years.

Update in English...https:/…2020.html
"Unfortunately, all of this, the virus spread in Mexico, was just a matter of time and testing. Despite any hopes out there as to confining it's movement, it's spreading almost everywhere (worldwide), and will likely continue to do so until it runs it's course, mutates for the better, and/ or we as humans develop anti-bodies and vaccines. We've likely got what looks like a rough bit of road in front of us short term, the next year or so, and my fondest hopes are that the community of Nations can come together on slowing and eventually stopping this virus sooner than later. But, I'm preaching to the choir here to most of you folks, you knew that already, like me, you were hoping we wouldn't be traveling this path again. Safe Travels, Safe Havens, Safe Harbors to all. ;-)"
There are now 27 confirmed cases in Quintana Roo with 22 of them being in Cancun. Of the 27 cases 16 are foreigners and 11 are Mexicans. https:/…
