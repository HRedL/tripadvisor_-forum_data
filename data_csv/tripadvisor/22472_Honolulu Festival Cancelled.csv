"Yep, and I posted before about FestPac being cancelled toohttps:/…"
"Wow!The article also mentions, ""The announcement comes just a day after organizers of another festival in Honolulu — the 13th Festival of the Pacific Arts & Culture — announced it would be postponed due to coronavirus concerns."""
"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't see your post"
"No, I hadn't posted about this weekend--you were first! I just was agreeing and adding that I had posted about FestPac."
I was afraid that was going to happen. When I was watching the news this morning they said it was still a go but shortly afterwards it was cancelled. I get why but it's such a bummer because it's so much fun and a lot of activities are outside!!
"They had cancelled the fireworks show about a week ago, already. I too figured it would all get cancelled.Mariah Carey just cancelled her March 10th concert (on Oahu) as well.https:/…"
"While Hawaii does not get a huge number of visitors for spring break, and there are no spring break parties in Hawaii (that I know of), it will have some effect in Hawaii and more if an effect in other parts of the country.Spam Festival in Waikiki is huge, but mostly for locals. Don't know if it will be affected or not. Scheduled for April 25th, so almost a couple months away. About 30,000 in attendance annually!"
Fingers crossed that the Lei Day festivities are intact. I doubt that draws an international crowd.
