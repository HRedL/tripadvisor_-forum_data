"Just an additional comment for those who read it but don't check, the advisory is from 5 days ago, March 11, so not a further intensification of events happening in the States over the past 48 hrs for example."
"You mean apart from the various states of emergency that have been declared? Mandatory closing of restaurants and bars, schools, etc. Banning of groupings of people more than 50.Yup, nothing much has happened over the weekend.... :-)"
