is this remotely possible ?
"Sure, if they dont open until a vaccine is widely available."

"If you only have 1/2 of the slots machines open, and limit the number of people at table games, it could work. Likewise, shows could in theory run with 1/2 seats empty, though this may not be financially realistic. Much harder to figure out social distancing at night clubs."
"With states, public health officials and even President Donald Trump weighing in on when the United States should lift social distancing requirements amid the coronavirus pandemic, a study authored by Harvard University researchers paints a bleak picture. The study, published in the journal ""Science,"" suggests intermittent social distancing might be necessary until 2022 if no vaccine or pharmaceutical treatments for the novel coronavirus are found. ""The total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave, which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts,"" the study said."
"HRV, respectfully there are many flaws in your suggestions.For one re table games that would mean one player and the dealer at a BJ table.Also One stickman and perhaps two players at a dice table.One player and dealer at any table game etc.Also, how would the casinos limit people walking around the casino floor etc.Just sounds like there are soooo many obstacles to overcome before a casino could be operational."
"Can a casino, hotel, restaurant or bar be profitable only operating at 1/2 of normal?"
"Social distancing is in place to keep those most at-risk for serious complications due to Covid-19 safe. If those people and the people who will be around them would stay home like they're supposed to, then social distancing wouldn't be required when/if casinos reopen. Unfortunately, all of these draconian measures are in place because those people would continue traveling if they weren't in place. That's why we are where we are now. Because of that, I'm betting when/if Vegas reopens, they'll start off by having slots set up further away from each other, and limits to the number of patrons who can sit at bars. The same will be true of restaurants as far as overall occupancy and table proximity. After an extended period of that, they'll probably start opening back up shows , pools, and nightclubs again, and then the final stage would be having everything go pretty much back to normal. Some sort of tiered reopen like that is what I see happening. No idea when, though."
"Highly unlikely....response to GoodBeerEdited: 7:30 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"I'm assuming there will be Plexiglas everywhere. Between players, between players and dealers, between machines. Lots of gloves and masks."
"Maybe rearrange casino floors, and put all the “old people” inside a pressurized “clean room?”Hunt"
I don’t want a vacation that involves gloves and a mask. I’m glad shaking hands will never be a thing anymore.
"I don't know the answer to this and a plethora of related questions. It seems managing compliance of distancing mandates in a casino environment ( we don't even know what those might be yet..will it remain 6 feet?) would be a logistical nightmare for those charged with enforcing them in real time. Add a few thousand deservedly fun-starved drunks to that scenario..I don't know how they accomplish it. That's not an intentionally negative take..seems like a really plausible problem, even without consideration of further spread, a potential second wave, all that. Regardless, it wouldn't likely make for a fun environment during a Vegas visit."
"A few days ago I'd have said that if any casinos reopen without social distance requirements, it'd be those in South Dakota. But since news of a huge cluster in Sioux Falls, I think it'll be a long time before they reopen.I suspect casinos will be among the last businesses to reopen, as 1000+ room casino hotels = SARS CoV2 petri dish. They're like nursing homes on steroids in terms of opportunities for the spread of such a contagious virus. If the disease is still present in the country when they do reopen, it will be interesting to see if cigarette smoking is allowed, as I think that the virus can be aerosolized and spread in exhaled smoke. It's gross enough inhaling someone's exhaled cigarette smoke. But in this day and age, it might be too much to continue to put up with, from a public health standpoint.Whatever happens with smoking, I think casino floors will look much different, with machines spaced out and tables setup differently. Even if casinos don't close buffets, the days of self-service are over! It will be cafeteria style. No more sharing one serving utensil between hundreds of people. Bars and lounges will be set up differently, with more space between stools and lounge furniture. I could see there being some kind of virtual chips in the future, so that people wouldn't have to share them in playing the games.When casinos reopen, many people aren't gonna be able to afford to go to Las Vegas. Others might still be freaked out about the danger of catching the virus. So I doubt there will be a big rush and I think there will be good deals for players when things start up again. I miss casinos, but I'm happy to trade them for people not getting sick. I believe that closing them is saving lives. After we eradicate the virus, casinos will gradually come back to life. Until then, we have much bigger problems than closed casinos."

"Social distancing will not and cannot become the norm anywhere. That would mean no more sports, movies, live shows, church, school, public transportation, air travel, and many others.It is hard enough for to turn a profit these days filling the entire venue, or airplane, let alone filling every 3rd or 4th seat. Schools have a hard time now paying for teachers, how are they going to hire 3 times as many to teach 8 to 10 students per class."
"Dave it’s going to be like this for about a year. Online learning, no fans in the stands, limited seats on planes and hotel rooms will be a thing."
"""Can a casino, hotel, restaurant or bar be profitable only operating at 1/2 of normal?""Of course they can. All they have to do is double the price of everything and double the casino game minimums. Actually they will be more profitable that way because variable costs like food, booze, labor, will be less than half of what it was."
They accomplish it this way. Those that participate (both employees and patrons) accept the risks. Those that don't stay home.

"As soon as it really hits the bottom line,. this will all be a distant memory."
Not just impacting Casino industry.... https:/…
"eddie, please define distant memory and hits bottom line."
"My bar has been closed for a while now. As much as I would like to re-open I can't think of a scenario where it would work with any social distancing rules in place. Another concern that applies to both bars and casinos, is that all it will take is one bad actor to make it all ineffective. Take Wynn. They released a 23 page list of restrictions they plan to have in place that might allow them to re-open safely. It'll be difficult, but it could work. I applaud their ethics in trying to strike a responsible balance between safety and turning a profit. But it will all be for naught if Caesars opens up and ignores all that. I see this happening everywhere. As for me, I'll risk financial ruin before I am a party to that."
"Best of luck to you, Upstate Guy... do you have any curbside pick up ? There is a local brewpub, recently opened before Coronavirus , and obviously struggling ..He sells growlers and 32oz cans of his beers..I don’t drink much beer, but buy a few growlers to help him out.."
"Some of my friends are trying to make a go with delivery/pick up to mixed degrees of success. You can only sell to go booze with food in NY. Food was never really our priority though. We're a classic pack them in loud college bar. To be honest I'm not stressed but only because it is completely out of my hands at this point. I guess I'm resigned to the disaster that it is. Come fall semester though, I really need to be able to do my thing, or THEN I will be stressed. We shall see."
"Can you do something like the weed dispensaries in Washington, DC do? There, it's like, ""Buy this candle for $300, and it comes with a free ounce of weed.""You could be like, ""Buy this bag of Tostito's and jar of salsa for $100, and we'll bring you booze for free!"""
"...and I'm sorry you're stressed. I'm stressed, too. I'm a freelancer, and I'm still working. My work depends on business owners spending $$ on marketing, though...and right now, that just isn't top priority for a lot of businesses. So...I'm seeing a noticeable decline in my work, and I think it's only going to get worse in the next few months.I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. I purposely ""live below my means"" BECAUSE I'm a freelancer (and because I like to have $$ for my hobbies, like Vegas and horses), so we're alright right now. I'm worried that this is going to have an economic toll that lasts for years, though, and I'm not really ready for that...Edited: 1:36 am, April 20, 2020 "
Let me paraphrase upstate guy. Right now I'm not worried and I accuse anyone wanting to reopen the economy of bring a redneck idiot. It's ok for ME now because the school year was coming to a close and business sucks over the summer anyway. In the fall when it really affects (who?) ME then it will be the responsible time to open.
"Steve...you ain't too good when it comes to paraphrasing.Please reread post #27.Edited: 9:40 am, April 20, 2020 "
I think Steve is a gud sighintist.
"Steve: Stable Genius!Upstate guy: why isn’t everyone as smart, compassionate and understanding as you are.People at risk aren’t just us old people, it’s people who smoke, people with diabetes, the morbidly obese, people with hypertension, people who drink too much... in other words, most everyone who goes to Las Vegas"
