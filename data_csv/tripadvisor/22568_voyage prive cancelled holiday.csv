hi i was supposed to fly out on tuesday 24th for my 50th birthday to egypt i booked through voyage prive but checking my atol certificate it says Who is protecting your trip?RED SEA HOLIDAYS VPUK - ATOL Number 9749 Does that mean i should be contacting red sea holidays or voyage prive because it says RED SEA HOLIDAYS VPUK so im confused has to whom im supposed to be asking any help is great oh by the way when i checked my invoice it now says VOUCHER
Contact whomever you booked with in the first instance.I hope you manage to find a way to celebrate your birthday.
"Yes, and do it quickly.Under the 2018 Package Travel Regulations, a holiday company is legally obliged to refund your holiday in full, in cash, within 14 days of it being cancelled. There is no leeway. ATOL is not relevant unless they go bust.But the EC and Governments are looking to suspend these regulations as many will go under, so best move quickly if you want your cash back.https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…Edited: 2:45 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"to all thats for answering i got this message from themI am sorry that you have to take a position like that, but at the moment we are not in position to offer cash refunds to anyone, only in travel credit.If you wish to file a formal complaint you can do it through complaints@voyageprive.com as well."
If they have cancelled you are entitled to a cash refund at the moment.
Your contact is through Voyage Prive. All they've done is sell you a Red Sea Holidays package holiday. It would have been easier if you'd have booked direct. At the moment they have to give you a cash refund.
If you paid with a credit card I would tell them you are commencing a chargeback and then I would do so
i paid with my debit card and bank wont cover it ive asked them ive still got emails back from voyage prive saying only credit notes
Contact the bank again tell them under the regulations you are entitled to a refund and expect the bank to complete the charge bank as requested.
"#8. Are you sure of that as OP bought through a 3rd party and VP fulfilled their part of the contract and bought from Red Sea Holidays. It’s RSH that aren’t refunding. I thought there was discussion about this when TC went bust and some had bought through 3rd parties. Hopefully someone can clarify.Ps there are no regulations for the chargeback scheme, it not the same as Section 75 which is covered by legislation.Edited: 12:27 pm, March 24, 2020 "
There are no regulations that say a debit card provider has to refund. As it stands neither Red Sea Holidays or VP can deny a refund. The package rules around refunds haven't changed - yet.
"neither one of them are replying oh sorry got his one the other day Thank you for your patience while we processed your request. We apologise if our customer service was not to our usual standard, but with Europe going into lock down in order to prevent the spread of the Covid19 epidemic, all of our call centres and offices have been affected. We are sorry that your trip cannot proceed as booked on this occasion, due to circumstances beyond our control. We wanted to come back to you regarding your question about your booking Although I understand your request, please be advised that under these circumstances we are only providing customers of a travel credit of the same value as the original booking. This is because under normal circumstances the trip would go ahead, and has only been cancelled due to the heightened security measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic. We offer you a travel credit which allows you to postpone your trip to a later date. I am sorry this is the case.The travel credit is available within a short period of time and can be accessed from your member account, enabling you to make the most of the deals we provide. The travel credit will be valid for one year, allowing you to take your time to rebook a holiday of your choic"
"Did you cite the PTR 2018 at them? Ask them under which regulation they are allowed to take that action, pointing at the one that says they can’t.‘This is because under normal circumstances the trip would go ahead,’ .......lol, they could claim this for any cancellation, in their control or otherwise!You could try social media, although they don’t appear to be very active on either FB or Twitter?"
Jenifer you have the legal right to a refund. Company decisions cannot override the law. Tell them that as the trip has been cancelled as per Section 13 Paragraph 2 (b) and they have terminated the contract as per Section 13 3 (a) of the Package Travel and Linked Travel Regulations 2018 they have to abide by Section 14.
#13 ive just messaged them quoting what you said lets see what they say once they respond
Hi Jenifer.I am in the same situation with Voyage Privé. Have you had any success in getting a refund?ThanksMark
"The rules on Package Holidays have changed. Now they *can* refuse a refund and give you a credit to use for up to 2 years, guaranteed under ATOL."
Richard B.Care to provide a link or proof of evidence of that change?
<< The rules on Package Holidays have changed. >>No they haven't.
nothing yet just keeping emailing me saying credit note
i found this link for abtahttps:/…coronavirus-outbreak
"It was announced by the Transport Sectetary, Grant Shapps a couple of days ago.Edited: 2:34 pm, March 27, 2020 "
"Yes, seen that the other day, but that does not say the regulations have changed.It’s more of an appeal for customers to accept vouchers or credit notes given the financial difficulties this is causing the industry and no surprise ABTA are pushing that."
"‘It was announced by the Transport Sectetary, Grant Shapps a couple of days ago.’No he didn’t, not yet!https:/…announcementsEdited: 2:42 pm, March 27, 2020 "
Nothing has changed yet. Irrespective of what the EC do with the PTR Abta are lobbying for an extension of the refund period from 14 days to 4 months. Customers would be issued with a refund credit which would mean they would get a refund in 4 months. Credits would be backed by Abta and/or Atol. Its hoped this may happen sometime next week.
nothing back form them yet ill keep you posted
"update i got email today from companyThank you for your e-mail, and I apologise if any replies were not as quick as you might have hoped. Naturally, we have been experiencing a higher volume of work, and have been dealing with this crisis essentially week by week and on a priority basis - Currently cancelling immediate departures, as well as helping people who are abroad.We are truly sorry, as you can imagine, if your trip did not proceed as booked on this occasion due to circumstances beyond our control (Clause 19). Please be advised that in these cases we are indeed only providing customers a travel credit of the same value as the original booking. This is because under normal circumstances the trips would go ahead and are only cancelled (when that is the case, as there are still a lot of flights and suppliers operating - yet we are still taking it upon ourselves to process other cancellations and protect our customers) due to the heightened security measures to prevent the spread of this pandemic. The travel credit will be accessible from your member's account enabling you to go on a relaxing holiday as originally desired. Please know that when you receive a travel credit you do not need to plan a trip anytime soon – You can book at least up until 1 year later, to go later on in 2021 or possibly even 2022. We are a travel company and thus our goal is to get our customers travelling, just like they always intended. You may also check official information regarding this: Some procedures and regulations have changed (allowing for the reimbursement in travel credit following the massive demands for cancellation and cash refunds faced by travel agencies) to preserve the industry and ensure we can all actually travel again in the future. (As opposed to years from now still not being able to go on the beautiful holidays I am sure you have always been excited for... Which we simply cannot let happen.) I am aware that you were already advised of the voucher refund current procedure (the only option), Jennifer. I am afraid that this answer is not going to change anywhere within the company, at least for the next 3 to 4 months, and your case will be closed again.If you do still wish to claim further Jennifer you may naturally do so directly to ABTA, or of course, through your Insurance.I can imagine travel credit is probably not what many wished for, but it provides the ability to go on holiday without giving a second thought to the cost as soon as this blows over! Kind regards,SaraVoyage Privé UK"
"Their T&Cs do not override the PTR so currently they are breaking the law. Unfortunately for you the rules around refunds may change this next week. What Abta are hoping to have approved next week is refund credits. Unfortunately for Voyage Prive it will mean they will still have to give you a cash refund, but not until the end of July. In the meantime I'd just report them to Abta for breaking their legal obligations. I'd email them to tell them that's what you're doing.https:/…register-a-complaintI'd also make a point of not booking through them again. It's not like they're just making it difficult to refund like some companies are, they outright denying you your legal right..As for this load of .................<< This is because under normal circumstances the trips would go ahead and are only cancelled (when that is the case, as there are still a lot of flights and suppliers operating - yet we are still taking it upon ourselves to process other cancellations and protect our customers) due to the heightened security measures to prevent the spread of this pandemic. >>Tour operators can't operate holidays. There is an FCO advisory against all but essential travel in place."
thank you Leyland10 ive already put a complaint in to abta last week when they first denied a refund
"I hope you get a satisfactory resolution. If refund credits get approved then Voyage Prive will have to refund you at the end of July, if you don't use the credit on another booking. If they don't get approved then I'm sure Abta will have words with them about breaking the law, which in turn should force a refund."
i sent them a link for abta about refunds should have been given in 14 days etc and the cheeky B can back given me a abta link
"So far I have only managed to get this. Thank you for your patience while we processed your request.I can see from your account that your travel credit refund of £830.08 was added to your Voyage Privé account on the 26/03/2020, however I understand that you are seeking an alternative to the travel voucher that we are providing for bookings that have been cancelled as a result of the Covid19 Coronavirus epidemic.Under these circumstances we are able to offer you the following alternatives; - An extension of the travel credit. If you feel that you would benefit from having more time in which to book your holiday then we can extend the validity of your travel credit.- We can issue a Letter of Loss which proves that you have not taken any of the services for which you have paid. This letter can then be used to reclaim the cost of the booking from your travel insurance provider. Should you not have personal travel insurance, please be advised that most credit card companies provide travel insurance as part of you agreement with them, so it is worth checking with them.- We can issue a credit note. The credit note will be issued in line with ABTA guidelines and it will be protected by ABTA/ATOL until the 31st of July. After this point it can be exchanged.Please do let us know which of these options would be most suitable for yourselves. It is currently Voyage Privé not to issue cash refunds. This instruction is direct from head office, and not something I am able to overrule. If none of these options are acceptable to you, then please send a separate email to complaints@voyageprive.comWe thank you for your understanding and wish you well in these difficult times Miles. I am sorry that I am unable to be of any further assistance,Kind regards,DavidVoyage Privé UKThis is despite pointing out that travel regs stipulate that a full refund should be given within 14 days and Abta guidelines are not legal it’s just a trait body."
Some nicely written e-mails. Doesn't address anybody's concerns but I like their style.
"Dear Mr. Kerrigan,Thank you for your reply. As previously mentioned, we are not able to offer a refund credit note for Tour operator bookings or Accommodation only bookings. You have a tour operator booking. Therefore, as mentioned you can continue to reply to this email and get the same answer, or you can follow the advice I supplied to help you avoid this pointless situation which I have again included at the bottom of this email. Highlighted. We are well aware of the difference between travel credit vouchers and refund credit notes. Please review the ABTA site with particular attention to the type of bookings for which the advice about a refund credit note applies. That applied to ""Package Holidays"" as defined by having two elements - accommodation and flights booked through us. This does not include a ""tour operator"" booking where these elements are combined into a single item. I would like to offer more precise information about the travel vouchers you are holding and how they can be used. The 1 year date refers to the booking period - not the travel dates. After this 1 year expires you can exchange the note for a cash refund, or alternatively at any point you can ask for an extension to the travel credit for up to 2 years. These conditions mean you can either exchange for cash after 12 months, or you can book a holiday potentially up to April 2022, for travel at a date even beyond this.So whilst we appreciate the issue with your partners holiday from work conditions, this option does not restrict that terminally whatsoever. Also as previously informed, it is not in the remit of this booking type (tour operator contract) to issue a cash refund directly. The customer service teams cannot make a different decision. If you remain unprepared to accept this travel credit solution then I invite you to escalate the issue via our claims/complaints team. To do this you must send a new email to ""complaints@voyageprive.com"" with the subject ""Covid 19 - request for cash refund"". This will close the issue with customer services team and avoid becoming embroiled in a loop of emails containing the same question/answer. I hope this information finds you safe and healthy and I remain at your disposal Mr Kerrigan. Kind regards, TrevorVoyage Prive UK Team."
"Hi, Did you have any luck?I am currently going through the same process with Voyage Prive and am getting the same cookie-cutter responses. This is the response I had. We had only paid the deposit on our holiday which I assume was just the flights. I got the below response.Thank you for contacting Voyage Privé following the booking cancellation and refund as travel credit.I apologise if our customer service was not to our usual standard, but with Europe going into lock down in order to prevent the spread of the Covid19 pandemic, all of our call centres and offices have been affected.I understand that you are seeking an alternative to the travel voucher that we are providing for bookings that have been cancelled as a result of the Covid19 Coronavirus pandemic.The travel companies like Voyage Privé are essentially intermediaries. What we do is we take the our clients´ payments and we pay to the airlines and the hotels. For us to pay refunds, we have to claim those monies back from our partners. And the 14-day window just is not really deliverable as the process takes time.Under these circumstances we are able to offer you the following alternatives;- An extension of the travel credit. If you feel that you would benefit from having more time in which to book your holiday then we can extend the validity of your travel credit. Alternatively after 12 months this can be exchanged.- We can issue a Letter of Loss which proves that you have not taken any of the services for which you have paid. This letter can then be used to reclaim the cost of the booking from your travel insurance provider. Should you not have personal travel insurance, please be advised that most credit card companies provide travel insurance as part of you agreement with them, so it is worth checking with them.- We can issue a credit note for bookings that were made with flights. The credit note will be issued in line with ABTA's procedure and it will be protected by ABTA and the ATOL Scheme of Protection until the 31st of January 2021. After this point it can be exchanged into cash by contacting us directly.Please do let me know which of these options would be most suitable for yourselves.I thank you for your understanding and wish you well in these difficult times."
"At least you're getting a response. I've getting complete silence - nothing from them for months. If they communicated with me I could start a chargeback, but they won't.I send them an email weekly but it's like shouting into the wind.My credit card company says that I can start a chargeback after 8th August, and I've lined up all the docs to do this. I can't wait until I don't have to deal with these people and their terrible customer service again."
