"We have been trying different genealogical websites in order to trace my husband's family tree. However, we haven't had much luck as they seem to assume we are looking for family members that immigrated to north America. We're not, our interest are the ancestors in Italy I think these sites picks up our IP address in Canada.Does anyone have any advice as to where to begin or the names of reputable geneology companies? There is no one in Italy that knows anything of the family history. My husband is the oldest family member left out of a family of 10. The family came from Santa Maria la Bruna in the Torre del Greco area, near Naples.Thank you."
Do you have anything to start with? Marriage records maybe? If you know the parish church that can be a good place to start.
"Thanks for your response. We can only think it was the parish church in Santa Maria la Bruna. Unfortunately when my lovely mother in law passed away, we were living in Canada and another relative emptied her little house and disposed of everything that had no monetary value; documents, photos etc. Very upsetting.I will look online to see if I can find the name of the church and see if there are contact details."
Okay. I think the two churches to start with would be SS. Crocifisso and S. Vincenzo a Postiglione.The first has a web site here: http://nuke.parrocchiasscrocifisso.it/The second one has a Facebook page here: https:/…
"Thank you so much, your help is greatly appreciated. I'm going to try and contact both these churches to see if they can help in any way.We are planning a visit to Italy, so they may let us take a look at their records."
"This isn't strictly travel related, but may help you a bit. At FamilySearch dot org, there are a limited number of microfilms for Torre del Greco between 1900 and 1911 available to browse through online. These are individual books for births, deaths, and marriages for some of those years. Membership is free, but you don't even need to be a member to view these collections.These books recorded events as they happened, and then at the end of the year, an alphabetical index would be created. You need to find the index page for each book and scan it for familiar names, and then use that to locate the actual page where the record was written. They're old and faded and hard to read, and the handwriting is tough to decipher, but you may get lucky. The birth and matrimony records are particularly useful, since they record the parents names and occupations, as well as where they were living and who witnessed the event. Maiden names are almost always used in the death records.Here's the direct link to the available records for Torre del Greco:http://tinyurl.com/y8fbaglu"
"You'll need to have some sense of dates and names that you're looking for. Parish registers are kept in date order. Some very organized priests (or more likely the women who worked for them) cross referenced each register with an alphabetical list but this is by no means common.I brought eleven members of my family to our parish church in Naples and the sexton brought us into the sacristy and took down the register so we could see the page with our great grandparents wedding. It was a really special day, especially for the youngest members of the family for whom this was all ancient history, but seeing the handwriting and the names made it real for them.Edited: 3 years ago "
Thank you so much for this information. I've now signed up with Family search.orgFascinating website.
Yes I think we must get as much information as we can before we track down the church my husband's parents were married at.I can imagine what a thrill it must have been for you to see your family name in the registry. Keeping our fingers crossed that we have a similar result.
When? When did they leave Italy? Start with what you know. https:/…aHope the records include clues.Don't assume anything. People often use names of larger nearby towns.How old ? Any adult males may have Italian military records. …beniculturali.it/index.php…I doubt they landed in Vancouver. Are you sure nobody in Canada has more clues?
"From 1866 onwards all records would be kept by the Comune (town council), not by parish churches. The relevant department in the local comune is here …torredelgreco.na.it/index.php/i-servizi/ser…However they would need something concrete to work on, like dates of birth, marriage etc.A useful source of self-translating form letters for writing to communi is at circolocalabrese.org/genealogy/italian-form-…Edited: 3 years ago "
"It's not an either/or situation. Yes, the comunes began keeping records but that doesn't mean that the churches stopped, they continued (and do to this day) to maintain records of sacramental events (marriages, baptisms, burials) in their parish. This is a key responsibility of the parroco."
Social Security death records in the US list where the person in question said he was born. Worth checking
"Thanks for your reply. My husband is the first to leave Italy. He left to go to England many years ago, we both came here from the uk when we got married.He was the youngest of eight children, most of them much older. Now that all his siblings /relatives etc have passed away he wishes he knew more about his family.His nephews and nieces don't have any information. He never met his grandparents and only knows his parents birth dates. He thinks they always lived in SM la Bruna.We will go to the church that he used to attend and see if they have records when we visit Italy next month."
"Thanks for this info. Today I will get in touch with the commune at Torre del Greco.We do have names and birth dates of my inlaws, so that's a start. Not sure of their wedding date though.We're pretty new at genealogical research but we will give it our best shot.Thanks to everyone who have given advice and website links."
"Good luck. Sometimes, the things you discover are amazing (and sometimes chilling). When I went through the microfilm death records for my great-grandfather's village, near Naples, I suddenly started coming across death records for his brothers and sisters, all within days of each other. When I researched a little further, I found out that a cholera epidemic swept through Italy that month, killing large number of people. My great grandfather was the only surviving male child in the family.When we toured the Naples underground in May, we learned that the cisterns there where closed that same year because of the cholera epidemic. What an amazing and real connection to the past, and to my own family.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Do you have family names? Husband's mother and father and grandparents? Family names/places of origin are on birth and death certificates which can be obtained from government agencies, frequently through a simple online request with payment."
"""that doesn't mean that the churches stopped,"" Churches only have records if the marriage was a church service. Not all are."
"We have my inlaws names and dates of birth, that's all.I know some countries do have birth marriage and death certificates available on line. I am not so sure about Italy. Will try and find out."
"In the US you can get death and birth certificates from state where they lived and died. There is information on those that can be extremely helpful. Not sure how it works in Canada. In Italy the birth records are kept in the Commune in the Ufficio Anagrafe. Going in person is, of course, the easiest way to search but some do have online records. The Commune in Cosenza in Calabria has an extensive data base for example."
The search alone is part of the fun when you do it in person. Even if you don't find the information you're looking for it will be an interesting experience.
Thank you to all who gave me such good advice.I think we have a rough idea of where to start and we're looking forward to the journey of discovery.
