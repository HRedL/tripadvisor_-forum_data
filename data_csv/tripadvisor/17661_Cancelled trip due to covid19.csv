We had a trip planned to new York in mid May 2020 however due to the pandemic we have decided to cancel. We are coming from the uk therefore due to pandemic ban/ entry in the states ban - we are expecting our flights to he cancelled soon.We would love to reschedule our Trip for later in the year when it’s still warmer- please recommenced a month where weather is still decent & New York can be enjoyed hopefully post pandemic crisis. Would love to visit in 2020 as planned. Any insight from local New Yorkers when the city will reopen?
"Definitely warm thru September, and October is generally comfortable.Lots of websites that list average and extreme temps and weather conditions, check one of those to see if expected conditions meet your needs"
"Yes, returning to business as normal is the big question. NYC may be nearing the peak of the epidemic while other areas are just starting. Parts of Asia are experiencing a second wave of infections. This may be a lost summer."
"September will still be warm but I'd prefer October. It might be a bit chilly but certainly comfortable & your chances of snow are nil,"
"September is usually very pleasant but (under normal circumstances) hotel demand and prices can be high because of the Tennis Open, Fashion Week, the UN General Assembly and a resumption of business travel after a summer lull.October is also pleasant although usually early for peak fall leaf color and Halloween can be fun. The NY Marathon is scheduled for Nov 1 so hotel demand increases in the days before If any or all of the above will be rescheduled / canceled and shift demand is TBDReopenings are likely to be incremental and things that bring together large crowds in confined spaces (theater, concerts, sports) may lag behind other openingsEdited: 9:31 am, April 10, 2020 "
"I expect our 3rd June visit won't go ahead, Delta Airlines will offer us a later date and hopefully by late September things might improve enough for a visit. Our last 2 visits were in late September and was very warm for Brits, but cools down in October. Personally I think July and August could be too hot for plodding the streets of Manhattan."
"Here is my two cents.. I live in the center of Manhattan and currently the city is a ghost town. 99% of business is closed. Even if they relax the restrictions in a month or two, without a vaccine or cure for coronavirus, nobody is going to take a chance going out to a sport event, theater, or crowded tourist site, etc. Public transportation, metro and buses are not being used except in emergencies when there is no other option. IMO do not make new plans right now. Be safe."
Buildings in NYC start to provide heat in October after the temperature bounces up and down and tends to stay cool.
"Mid-may wasn't going to happen. I'm not sure how you define warmer. Early September can be quite hot and then its nice outdoor early fall weather the rest of the month. Personally I like October when things start to cool off where you may need to wear a light jacket at night but during the day you are usually fine without. Cool crisp air but not ice cold. As to when the city will reopen I don't think that is really the best question. The city won't suddenly open and then be ready for millions of tourists. That is likely the last thing they would want. The opening will be gradual with non-essential businesses starting up. Hopefully that happens in mid to late may. Don't see it happening before that. However it could be July or August before large tourist attractions start opening. Tourist attractions draw large crowds, so until this is fully under control I just don't see tourist attractions being opened or large events being allowed. All this will be dictated by the virus numbers and nobody knows, but my guess is based on the current numbers. If number of new cases start going up again then everything will drag on longer. There are still a lot of questions that need to be answered."
"If you can take the colder, it really isnt that cold, go for December, Its likely the pandemic will be over by then and many people feel December is actually the best time to visit with all the lights and activities going on"
"I would wait until there is a clearer picture of what is going on -- in particular, what is going on at international borders, both yours and ours."
"We too had May reservations that had to be cancelled. September and early October are fairly pleasant but I’m not getting my hopes up. We are rethinking perhaps a Christmastime visit if things are up and running(especially the theatres). However, we may be looking at next spring realistically considering the circumstances."
Thank you all for the advise and recommendations
"I'd try October. One of my favorite months, still not that cold, sometimes quite warm, but changing leaves. It's a great month.ALl the hotels and airlines I have seen are offering generous free cancellation bookings now, so doesn't seem like a huge risk to me to make a plan and book. I know you can cancel the hotel no problem, with airlines I'm not sure the deals. I think some it may just be you can cancel and keep the dollar credits in an acct for no penalty to book another flight within a pretty generous time period. Since I tend to use the same few airlines for all my flights, that is a no cost to me as I know I'll be making another flight within the next year or so. You may differ, but since you really want to come, it seems even if you coudln't come in October, you could use those credits on the same airline with 12-18 months for sure.I was thinking of a trip to France in September as the one I was planning in July isn't going to happen, so it's the same deal for me.I don't think local New Yorkers have any way to see the future compared to anyone else, the news on this is public and online and in the media, doesn't matter where you live to know it."
I have a trip planned for the end of June.Planning to reschedule (as soon as airline allows me to change/ cancel flights)to Christmas or next spring.I am of the opinion there is no point visiting NYC when it isn't fully operational and not being able to enjoy all it has to offer.
I just can't see any scenario whereby one country will let a citizen of another country enter into that first country without proof they have been vaccinated or proof (from I presume an antibody test) that have had the virus.Both are some months if not years away. Combine that with the fact they we have no idea if one can catch it again and I cannot envisage international travel restarting until 2022 at the earliest.
"""without proof they have been vaccinated or proof (from I presume an antibody test) that have had the virus.""IMO the better test would be the one that determines whether you currently have it. At this point, having had the antibody test doesn't currently mean you can't get reinfected; only that you had it. Maybe that will evolve into something more bulletproof. And if the COVID vaccine ends up like the flu vaccines, there is no guarantee you won't still get it while you are visiting and spread it around. Hopefully, the COVID vaccine evolves into something different than that.Edited: 8:13 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"I agree with adamhornets, not to mention the fact that when things start to""reopen,"" until there is a vaccine, there are still going to be social distancing restrictions on many aspects of life: how far apart tables need to be in restaurants, how many people can be in a theater at same time, how many in a museum, a shop, etc. Some places may just close faced w/restrictions like that, others may open but, e.g., charge much more than before, require reservations that they did not require before. Anyone who's contemplating ""Christmas in NY"" this year may be very surprised by what is and is not available to them."
You are assuming international flights for tourist purposes may be operating by then - which may well not be the case.Some experts expect significant contagion well into the fall (remember Singapore which seemed to be on the downturn but then flared up again.)
Thank you all
I saw a surprising article today that cruise lines are getting lots of reservations for 2021. This was even more than in a similar period prior to the 2019 season.
"Many people whose 2020 cruises have been canceled received (often in addition to refund for their current cruise) a credit for a future cruise. There may be a time limit on that credit, plus its value will diminish over time if prices increase. Not to mention fact that ""cruisers"" seem a very committed lot with few concerns about some of the recent problems on cruise ships."
