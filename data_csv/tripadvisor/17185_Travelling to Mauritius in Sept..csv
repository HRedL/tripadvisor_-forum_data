"Hi guys,We are thinking in travelling to Mauritius from 8th of sept. till 22nd.We are planning to rent a house on airbnb because we like it that way. We are planning to stay at flic flac.That said, this means that we will have to either eat out or make the food at home.From my research, typhoid can be a problem. What do you think? The restaurants take care on preparing food?Water will be bottled.Should we take this vaccine?Tetanus, I read that it is recommended to take vaccine or booster as well. We have been vaccinated 2 yrs ago so I don't know if it is worth to take another dose.Since we will be travelling from UK (living there and before in Portugal), do we need to take yellow fever vaccine?Mosquito's, should we be concerned?Are there in Mauritius the following:Chikungungya, dengue and zika?Regarding yellow fever apparently it is controlled. Any comments on this please?Did I miss anything? Any other suggestions or advice's?Best."
"Although there are no requirements for specific vaccines for UK visitors, I would say that you need to contact your GP for the latest medical advice for Mauritius.There are mosquitoes so do take DEET based anti mosquito repellent."
Typhoid is not a problem in Mauritius.Yellow fever is not necessary and your tetanus should be fine.We do have cases of dengue now and then but not Zika and no chick this year.https:/…Vaccine_recommendationsfitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations/africa/maur…If in doubt see your Practice Nurse.
"Thanks for the reply both.Bronia do you livre in Mauritius?Say that I stay at an airbnb accommodation. Can I take shower without problems using the water from the public network? I suppose it happens the same in the resorts, or maybe they have some sort of filters for this? I am asking this since it is not advisable to drink tap water (but that's not a problem, not even in the UK I drink tap water or Portyugal when I used to live there as well). The concern is mainly regarding food and how it is cooked when water is used. Since I will be staying at an airbnb accommodation I will have to eat out and maybe every now and then eat at home breakfast or dinner.Can you give me some feedback on this as well?Getting back to the vaccines, the two recommended ones are tetanus (which J had a dose two years ago) and hepatitis A, which apparantely it is important because of the water and food. The same goes with typhoid. Why do you say that typhoid is not necessary?Best"
"I said typhoid is not a problem not that the vaccination is not necessary - see this thread:https:/…83352998<< << Typhoid is a bacterial infection transmitted through contaminated food and water. Previous typhoid illness may only partially protect against re-infection.Those at increased risk include travellers visiting friends and relatives, those in contact with an infected person, young children, long-stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor sanitation.PreventionAll travellers should take care with personal, food and water hygiene.Typhoid vaccinationBoth oral and injectable typhoid vaccinations are available and are recommended for those at increased risk (see above).Vaccination could be considered for other travellers >>Taken from this site:https:/…Vaccine_recommendationsI live in Mauritius six months of the year and cook and eat out in malls and restaurants but don't eat food from street vendors and only drink bottled water - also use it to brush teeth and wash salads and make my ice cubes.You can get Mauritian snacks form the take aways in the supermarkets.I never have any problems with gastro-intestinal diseases.If you do a search re street vendors it will bring up lots of older threads and the info is still relevant - just copy and paste the link:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/SearchForums?q=street+vendors&scope=2&sub-search=Search&ff=9265&geo=293816&returnTo=__2F__ShowForum__2D__g293816__2D__i9265__2D__Mauritius__2E__htmlEdited: 3 years ago "
Thanks for the reply.Onde last question. Is there any preferred mosquito repellent in Mauritius? What the locals use that is really effective?Regards.
"Yes, we use Peaceful Sleep stick which is a roll on. It's a South African product with DEET and is very effective. Get it from the local supermarkets."
I live in Mauritius and have had no problems drinking the tap water and using it for cooking. I also regularly eat food from the street vendors and have never had issues. I am up in Pereybere area which is a bit less populated than some towns so this might contribute to the high standard of cleanliness? The beaches and streets are swept daily and garbage is removed regularly.
"Right - you own the dive centre at Pereybere OceanspspiritMauritius, right?We live in Pereybere too - small world.Yes they sweep the beach but not sure about the rest of it!"

"Yes I run the diving center opposite the beach, it's a tough job but someone has to permanently live in paradise! I love Mauritius and especially this small part of it, it's so quaint with real characters on the beach that have been there for decades. Nice sense of history."
"Small world, I live in Pereybere too but my perception of it is slightly less rosy than yours.Some advice: Don't try promoting your business on forum as it's against TA posting rules."
"Wouldn't dream of using a forum to promote, just helping with local information where possible :)"
Then why don't you include info on your company on your profile? TA advises businesses to do this so that posters are aware that they are affiliated to a business.
Just came across this longish article about street food and hygiene in Mauritius - a bit of an eye opener.Seems that the authorities are quite powerless to enforce even the Food Act governing rules and regulations about hygiene.www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx…
"It is an eye opener and well worth reading. I encourage anyone interested in eating street food to read the article and then decide, hygiene standards are worse than I thought.."
"Oh wow, definitely an eye opener, and there seem to be no effort by the authorities to enforce the legislation."
Which is probably why there is such a high incidence of Gastro enteritis generally in Mauritius which reaches epidemic proportions every summer Tilly.Every summer we have articles in the press about GI outbreaks and how to avoid them.Edited: 3 years ago 
"Do your vaccineBuy mosquito es repellent, do noy use the one that makes a lot of smoke as it is like smoking a pack of cigarettes. Citonelle is a good mosquito repellentTap water is safe. Not to worry about except when there is a heavy rain the day before. Be wary of the locals who might charge you high prices though they are indeed very friendly people. If you want yo eat outside, first observe, to get an idea how is the level of hygiene."
