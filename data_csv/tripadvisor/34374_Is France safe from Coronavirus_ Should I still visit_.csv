Myself and two family members have planned to go to France from March 25 - April 1. We will be in Paris and Nice. Do you think it’s a good idea to still go given the spread of corona into Italy? How are things for tourists in France now? I know people are not coming as usual but is the virus contained? A bit worried but don’t want to lose money and blow it out of proportion. Thanks.

"I don't think there are any totally safe place on the planet. As soon as there are travelers around it can happen. In Paris, in DC or in Montreal. For now it has been quite limited in France. So while I'm following the news, I don't think at the moment that the risk is too great not to go. Crossing my fingers as well since I'm arriving in France March 30th for 5 weeks !"
Me too April 1 for a couple of months -- we are waiting till late in March to pull the plug if we need to. It will cost us several thousand dollars to cancel as travel insurance doesn't cover this -- but we will if we must.
"No one can offer a definite and an accurate answer. This is not an epidemic to a given area but a pandemic so it would be onerous to compute the probability of attracting the virus, if one travels or not. Unlike Aids that transferred through blood stream, this one transfers insidiously."
Do you seriously think you are any safer at home than in France?
Is it contained.. it's a virus.
Why ask medical advice on a travel forum? We can’t advise you of the risks. Keep up to date with your own countries travel advisory or the world health organisation.

"People are conflating 1-the health risks (which we don’t really know) with 2-the impact on travel/closures/getting quarantined in a hotel etc. Even if coronavirus is containable, less dangerous/prevalent than the flu, and even though yes- you can get it at home — the point is you don’t want to be traveling to an impacted region. That is what many travelers are trying to assess here. The impact on logistics and not “medical advice”Edited: 3:52 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Janet if you can't get refunds then keep the reservations anyway just in case your reasons fade away with the springtime sun.I think this front-page article says 5 cases now in all of France: https://www.francebleu.fr/Meanwhile the Mayor of San Francisco has declared a virus emergency in preparation for its arrival, from google.."

"3 new cases in France today, and the death of a French teacher in Paris who had not travelled. Keep an eye on the news."
"Its much too soon to determine today what the situation will be at the end of March - the picture is changing daily.I'm headed to Paris on Friday and currently, I judge my risk to be the the same in Paris as it is at home. So, I plan to enjoy my holiday whilst continuing to take sensible precautions - lots of hand washing etc, just like I do in my own home town.Maybe tomorrow, things will change...who knows?!"
In the US we assume it is not currently endemic and spreading but that is because we have no means to test people. Only those identified as traveling from China have been tested so it is entirely possible it is spreading undetected just as apparently it did in France e.g. the French teacher in Paris. And of course travel increases your odds of coming in contact with people who have been in Korea or Japan or Singapore etc.

"welcome,you can PLAN to go, but dpending on what happens where ever, you may NOT be able to go. Every country and do their own thingy and if they want to close their boarders for whatever reason, they can. hope you bought or will buy travel insurance.good luck"
"Most travel insurance does not cover fear of COVID-19per AIG: Generally, fear of travel is not a covered event under most of our policies.https:/…coronavirus-advisory"
Stay at home. Review likelihood contracting this disease. Consider the availability of medical services within more than shouting distance. No do not risk your health for such a casual or serious visit. So little is known about it. France will be there later.
"lulu_teee, my two posts, first, it is a virus so no once a virus is released it's not contained it will be something the world will live with. My second post, was advice to Janet who said she is in a similar boat as you and I basically told her not to cancel, I also said like others who posted how many cases are be flouted in the news, this apparently I can't keep up with, I thought it was 5, I also mentioned that SF local government is declaring an emergency even without any cases giving an idea how local and national governments are reacting, meaning perhaps France might lockdown like northern Italy.As for locals, in my circle, thinking the nad behaviour of the panicky people is the epidemic rather than the virus, the French don't really trust their government blindly, hence the constant strikes over here. There are some people on the metro wearing masks, the lines for major sites are being reported as non existent.People are still asking questions about their upcoming trips on the forum, people have posted recent trip reports having a lovely time here.I have posted recently actions from the UN, the CDC, government bodies, major research hospitals doctors what portends their future plans, this includes Internet censoring and shutdowns, martial law and what the US CDC called for a war footing scenario if worse comes to worse. People on the forum often say check with government bodies as I listed but sometimes don't want to hear what they are doing.However, Spring has sprung (although it snowed today just outside of Paris) and with Spring time and UV killing Sun rays so goes another flu season. Like someone suggested, wait if you can to decide last minute on how our government treats the latest surge in cases, some officials can't wait to play sheriff. There are French TV channels all in English, hard to believe but yes, just use YouTube (french news in english), find the news reprts, discern, and flip your coin.Edited: 3:20 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"#24-do you get exhausted spinning your nonsensical conspiracy theories? Or is it simply a case of being too lazy to actually learn about what's actually going on?Why anyone would take the advice of strangers on the internet regarding a serious health matter is beyond comprehension, particularly with those like #24 screaming ""don't trust the government or the CDC or the WHO or research hospitals; all they want to do is declare martial law."" But trust him as he knows better, even though it's clear that he has zero understanding of the science behind the virus-but he knows more than all of them."
"Apart from France we'll be travelling to five countries this year. We are fairly calm about Covid-19 (what can you do if you live a fairly active working and social life?) But - the big ""but"" is we don't want to be stranded somewhere like people in Tenerife not allowed to leave their hotel rooms. We have commitments like everyone and have to get back to base. That's what puts me off non essential travel at the moment - not the virus itself as we're thankfully quite healthy. If I were elderly and in poor health I don't think I would go ahead."

Ok I get people are worried BUT there is not a single country that does not have this virus now. So does that mean you will no longer go to grocery store to the movies to the mall? I would presume no because you feel safe!Take precaution use wipes ( I prefer because wipes wipe away the dirt !) liquid just spreads it around . Use both if you prefer to be cautious. Common sense.
"Personally, I will be monitoring this forum in preparation for my April trip to see how the coronavirus is effecting Paris - will museums be closed, will soccer/football games be played, etc.That will definitely play a part in whether or not I will cancel my trip. Ultimately, an opinion forum, such as this, should not be where a person is heavily influenced when making such an important decision. That's when speaking to your own physician, reading government warnings, etc take priority.Like an earlier suggestion though, I wouldn't cancel until just before our departure, as so much can change."
This article is behind a paywall but I offer it here anyway as it is an excellent guide to planning for travel in light of a Covid. https://www.wsj.com/articles/smart-travel-planning-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-11582726776?emailToken=e5f851acd68e9e2fd5d67fb9c8f218b8TKT5d3/Yv9HDH+1lRTiUcY+0ExABt/nDeJGbVAiTJCDhsX0vtpiGF7KrfHbUTyUtle6X8HGfliRTca33Z4J8tYf/n+bK75Qi3bBrfjDLKeQ%3D&reflink=article_copyURL_share

The link didn’t post as a link so trying again. It’s from yesterday’s Wall Street Journal. https://www.wsj.com/articles/smart-travel-planning-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-11582726776?emailToken=e5f851acd68e9e2fd5d67fb9c8f218b8TKT5d3/Yv9HDH+1lRTiUcY+0ExABt/nDeJGbVAiTJCDhsX0vtpiGF7KrfHbUTyUtle6X8HGfliRTca33Z4J8tYf/n+bK75Qi3bBrfjD
"AVT, if you consider any challenges to your fact-free posting as ""personal attacks"" you have very thin skin-but let's look at the record of personal attacks: you claim those who disagree with you are ""sheeple"" who are ""brainwashed"" by the main stream media. You further claim that Queen Elizabeth and Bill Gates own the virus in question, and that the CDC/research universities/WHO/Pentagon are all in a conspiracy to impose marital law and censorship-and for the censorship, you cite the PRC which as been censoring its people for just about 70 years now. And for the ""marital law"" you cite a pandemic treatment plan.Why you feel compelled to spread disinformation at best and outright falsehoods at worst is beyond me, but it's clear you've got plenty of time on your hands to do so.And you are clearly the sort that if this issue weren't in the public news, you'd be crying governmental and/or media ""coverup"".So people can either take your advice-and what is that, exactly? It's clear that you have zero understanding of what a pandemic is, and how to deal with one-but you've got no shortage of opinions anyway.Or they can listen to people who actually understand the science.But please, don't cite youtube or already discredited Russian trolls as your authorities."
"Same, I am travelling in the month of March and all the things are pre-booked and all of them are not refundable.

As of now Italy is a Level 2 on the CDC’s list of areas where there is a travel advisory:https:/…index.html
"My short response to yet another personal attack from the same.I have only posted official websites to government bodies participating in dealing with the virus.

"Thanks Planner. For some reason I’m not able to reply on that thread. It seems the concern for anyone not at high risk in traveling to a CDC Level 2 area is the concern mentioned by another poster, and in the WSJ article I posted, that the place you are traveling may impose a quarantine while you are there. I guess everyone has to decide that for themselves."
20 new cases reported north of Paris just 20 minutes ago. Keep monitoring….
20 new cases.. that's a cluster presumably..

"To my favourite internet stalker, thank you, your relentless attacks means we are all moving forward understanding how to plan a Paris holiday during these moments of uncertainty. Without you this subject would be dead in the water.Any thoughts on border closings, quarantine buses, planes, hotels, web access, legality of leaving a quarantine area? All discussions at the tabletop meeting a few months ago which are now reality.When I don't ask myself these questions I become number one sheep. It's time for critical thinking so share how you would prepare for a trip to Paris right now, please, we're all waiting. Namaste"
"My daughter planned to visit a friend in Paris over spring break who is in a study abroad program. The university recalled all study-abroad students, so now my daughter has her plane ticket but no friend to visit or place to stay. She would still like to go to Paris. I do not worry about her contracting the coronavirus, but am wondering if the youth hostels are open and will have other travelers staying there that she could perhaps team up with to tour the city. Thoughts?"
"Everything is still open in Paris, and even if we move to ""phase 3"" (which we almost certain will in no more than a week or two), that will almost make it easier to do things because phase 3 means that the situation is totally generalized and there is no longer any point in confinement or whatever.Most young people know that they are not really at risk, so I really doubt that the hostels will be empty.The real worry would be the possibility of one's return home being blocked, but that is up to your own country."
"I would postpone this trip until next year if you have refundable tickets, and suppose her friend will be back too. Some airlines are allowing you to change nonrefundable a few months out. I wouldn't leave Paris if I lived there, but travel is just more difficult right now and she could get stuck somewhere with more of a challenge to get home."
Do you think that this virus will have disappeared next year? The specialists don't seem to think so.
"This may help perspective.. two ladies stuck on the Grand Princess have been video blogging a daily youtube update on what it is like being quarantined. The vlog is not coming from mainstream so not for everybody. Yesterday's vlog is quite something... cute, sad, heart-warming, encouraging: https://youtu.be/tM1dlIvOglYToday's vlog from the two ladies is a bit more _____ as they describe being fed up with mainstream news scaring their children back home, etc and with the general public that have that blame the victim mentality.Anyway, it shows how 2 people are dealing with being quarantined inside a cruise ship and I thought it might give some perspective."

"My wife and daughters are dispersed about Paris and all are reporting in that life looks normal apart from an occasional person wearing a mask. The teenage adult daughter doing up Paris says all normal. The other two are shopaholics enjoying Paris, a Japanese lunch and about to see a ballet at the Opera in Bastille (under 5,000 tickets so the ballet is on).I decided since I have 3 pairs of boots on the ground in Paris that I could miss the cold windy rainy weather and take care of other business instead of catching a cold walking around. I had planned to walk through Luxembourg gardens, islands, bridges and across the river, and one new craft beer bar that I haven't yet tried. Alas, I wait for better weather and my family will definitely text me if anything is really not in balance with Parisian nature."

ARHolds....the gov’t plans on announcing Level Three before the end of the week.
#57--Here's a good website for all things CDG: https://easycdg.com/
"It is a bit frustrating as our airline is currently not waiving any change fees for flights booked prior to March 6th. So we are looking at 300 euro per person to reschedule our flights. Also, we have lodging reserved and also an Air BnB but those are also not cancellable/ able to reschedule currently due to the fact that there are not current warnings against France that qualify. This makes it extra difficult to know what to do. If I could reschedule my trip, cancel my Air Bnb, move the dates for at least some of the tickets I've already purchased for attractions, etc, I would be much more inclined to reschedule to a later date this year. As is, it feels like our hands are tied as we would be out thousands of dollars. We are supposed to leave Thursday March 12th for Europe and supposed to be in Paris next week."
"@phread...What will Level 3 mean? We are supposed to fly to Paris this Thursday and still debating about cancelling. We are worried about everything being closed when we get there as well as being quarantined when we return or, worst case, being quarantined while there."
Unless someone here works in the relevant department we are all pretty much in the dark. Here's a fairly calm explanation of what Stage 3 might look like. It's not there yet. https://www.france24.com/en/video/20200305-f…
"@RARP – there are no clear cut guidelines for what will happen. They will really want people to stay in and stop being out and about. Already, no events for more 1000 people (ie, the Opera, concerts, athletic events), the SNCF is reimbursing for any cancelled trips, and visits to the Louvre are limited to people with timed tickets. An elementary school in the 15th was closed because a child tested positive today, and a Dad of two young kids was hospitalized in the 16th, so it is now quite active in Paris.Edited: 12:59 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Doesnt sound good :(. 6 weeks till we go, hopefully things will have settled by then :("
"We reluctantly cancelled our trip due to fears of quarantine/self-isolation. We were supposed to leave tomorrow evening. Hope to reschedule for late June/early July, if things calm down, or early November. Hoping the extra insurance we bought will give us at least 75% refund."
The US is considering stopping all travel from the EU. You would most likely have found yourself stuck here.
Do you have any sources? I have several trips planned.Thanks
I personally find it alarming how unreported and under tested the US is. I would take my chances in France over travelling to the US which has artificially low reported number of cases.
"Trump bans travel from Europe for 30 days, beginning FridayEdited: 9:17 pm, March 11, 2020 "
Plan on staying for awhile if you go. The US just banned travel and cargo from Europe for 30 days starting on Friday.
Ban goes into effect midnight Friday.
so trying to figure how that will work...US can fly to europe but can't come home? I don't really understand it...other than the airlines are really in trouble...I mean essentially no travel to or from Europe for 30 days...however he seemed to exempt UK...which really did not make sense to me...

"Americans will apparently be allowed to travel from Europe if they ""have been appropriately screened"". How that would work - who knows.Ireland, like the UK, is not included in the ban. So people could just hop over the channel and continue their journey that way? Calling it a ""foreign"" virus..."
"I left on March 17. See the ongoing news in English on France 24, accessible on your phone.The French are very résistent to limitations on their freedoms so measures were not put in place until this day despite many cases in Paris for weeks. The director of my institute contracted the virus weeks earlier as well as two of his associates. They went home but all else continued as normal. The president had to use repressive measures to keep people at home including 100,000 police in the streets giving fines. Now 2 weeks later the infection rate has climbed from 1000 the day I left to 25 000. Parks and walks along the Seine are now closed. This was to be a long season of strikes that began in early December and were continuing. My advice is to avoid the country during strikes and stay far away until things gave come fully back to normal.Edited: 8:57 pm, March 25, 2020 "
