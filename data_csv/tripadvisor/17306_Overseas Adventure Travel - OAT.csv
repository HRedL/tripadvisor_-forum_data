"BUY THE INSURANCE! If you are going to book with OAT which I would not recommend make sure you buy their very exspensive trip insurance. We didnt and boy did we pay...our car was broken into 18 hrs before our flight all of our luggage passports and of course my wallet were stolen, leaving us unable to take our much anticipated trip to Turkey. It was Saturday of Memorial Day weekend and nothing was open there was no option to get replacement passports issued. Not only did OAT offer to do nothing for us, they even refused to give up the airline tickets which were issued in our name so that we could at least fly somewhere later once our passports had been reissued. We spend 8K on this vacation and we are not wealthy retirees like most of their travelers, it will take us a long time to recover from this loss. If I had booked this travel independently like our previous trips I would have at least been able to use my plane tickets later and cancel my hotel rooms. BOO OAT! You are everything that is wrong with corporate america, so greedy!"
DO NOT travel with Overseas Adventure Travel. We paid in full for a trip to India and found out that they still plan to fly us via Air India after FAA has downgraded the airline due to safety concerns. OAT cares more about their bottom line than the safety of their customers.
"The response should be, always buy insurance regardless of who you are travelling with. I travelled with OAT to Tanzania in September last year. It was a terrific trip. I did my own flights because most tour companies have their preferred airlines. I like to book my own travel because I can choose which airline I prefer to use and I can decide when I want to arrive and leave. If, for some reason, you miss your flight, you can usually get a credit less fees from the airline you booked with, but not always. It depends on your class of ticket. The cheaper the ticket, the higher the penalties and the more restrictive the options. You don't need to take OAT's trip insurance. There are other travel insurance companies that do the same thing. Even your own personal insurance company may offer trip insurance. Mine does. Always read the small print when you book trips. That way you will be spared any surprises and disappointments in the long run."
Yu2's post is excellently put. If you have the correct insurance in place before you book you should be covered.A company like this cannot give you the tickets or pass the cost on because it is a totally different system they use and agreement they make with the airlines to book seats. I am really sorry you went through such an awful time but it is the theives you should be mad at as they were the ones to ruin your trip - not a holiday companyIt is up to you to make sure you are covered for all eventualities and you need to read the company terms and conditions before you enter into contract with them by booking as throughly as you read your insurance details. Can't understand why you weren't covered for the loss of your holiday by your insurance company.
"Thanks for the review and advice. I am booking a single spot on an October 2015 40 day trip to Africa with OAT. Good advice on the insurance and travel. I think if I plan my own flight and arrive at the hotel they will be using at least one day ahead, I should be fine. Were you also traveling solo? Any further advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
"Even though your OAT trip is a long way off, keep up to date with the present situation/advisories in Kenya on the Kenyan forum. I assume with a 40 day??? trip you have Kenya on the itinerary."

It makes good sense to always have some travel insurance when you go out of the country for business or pleasure. It may cost you a little money but you’re not left out in the cold if something goes wrong while traveling.
"OAT is affiliated with AARP. I will never, ever have anything to do with any of their enterprises (Grand Circle Tours is also an affiliate of AARP)"
"AARP and Grand Circle were founded by the same person and GC originally served AARP members. However, in 1982 Alan Lewis bought Grand Circle and as far as I know ended its affiliation with AARP. The GC and OAT demographics tend to the older end of the scale, but my OAT trip to Thailand (excellent, BTW) included a large extended family group with three children. If anyone hates AARP and anything ever associated with it, then it's good to hear that they won't ever ever book an OAT trip, because I might take one again and I'd hate to travel with someone toting a grudge. About insurance. In my years of reading and posting around TA, it seems to me that it must be easier in some other countries to obtain good travel insurance coverage. Typical US homeowner insurance policies don't include travel insurance although they may insure you against theft/damage of specific items of personal property while away from home. Thus we have to seek out specific travel insurance, and that can be, as amply documented on TA forums, confusing. I'm sorry the OP suffered a horrible theft, but as has been noted, OAT didn't ruin their trip, the thieves did. Also, what on earth were they thinking by leaving their *wallets* and *passports* in their car? The OP said that when the car was broken into, <<all of our luggage passports and of course my wallet were stolen>> but good grief, I would *never* in a zillion years walk off and leave my wallet, much less my passport, in my car. BTW, I bought the OAT travel insurance on my Thailand trip. Then, protestors closed the Bangkok airport, and vacated it only a few days before we were supposed to leave. We played ""telephone chicken"" with OAT customer service reps almost up to departure date; they kept saying no the trip wasn't cancelled when we all knew darn well there was no way United would be flying into Bangkok the day of our scheduled trip (airport had to be cleared/secured, airlines had to get organized and caught up). OAT was hoping we'd go ahead and reschedule under our insurance, but we hung tough. Finally OAT had to admit they would need to reschedule us, which they did. At no charge, of course. And our insurance remained in effect for the rescheduled departure date trip. (""We"" = my friend and I; we each booked the trip separately but wanted to be on the same tour, each with our own rooms.)"

OAT seems to be a little slow in confirming flights to Au. for May 2015. I have unofficial flights(most seats assigned) there and back except for LAX-MEL. They originally said 320 days out and now it is 235 out. OAT keeps using the idea as to Qantas opening up group tickets for my date.Any suggestions or tips?
"jesse.... we just booked the pure new zealand trip in december 2015. are you taking the pre-trip?please review the trip when you return..thanks, j"
"this will be our second trip with oat. we did the botswana, zambia, zimbabwe, south africa trip in august...it was fantastic. since we lived in sydney, australia for 3 months, we don't want to do the post-trip. haven't read any reviews of the pre-trip anywhere except on the oat forum. all those reviews were excellent, but my husband would like to see some off of the oat site, do you have any suggestions of where i might find some?very much looking forward to your review of the trip....and if anyone in the group does the pre-trip, please let me know what they say. have a fabulous time.j"
"We recently tried to book an African Safari with OAT, especially because of their advertised cancellation policy allowing us to ""cancel up to the day of departure"" due to Ebola concerns. That may be true, or not since OAT refuses to put this in writing, and as a matter of fact, insisted we agree to terms and conditions that specifically say the trip is non refundable after a few days. They wouldn't relent and we would not agree. Sleazy sales tactics by OAT were a red flag that if we were to have a problem on this trip we would get no help from OAT. OAT, don't advertise that which you don't include. You lost a potential customer forever."
"OAT's advertising states ""Enjoy FREE Single Supplements on all of our Land and Small Ship Adventures and trip extensions."" Therefore, if you travel as a couple, your effective cost is much more per person than a single, since two people get the same room as a single (yet pay twice as much). OAT does not give any benefit or discount to the Couples. As an OAT client, It is clear that OAT caters to singles and penalizes Couples."
"COUPLES BEWARE...OAT's advertising states ""Enjoy FREE Single Supplements on all of our Land and Small Ship Adventures and trip extensions.""

OAT does not give any benefit or discount to the Couples. As an OAT client, It is clear that OAT caters to singles and penalizes Couples."
"I received an unsolicited e-mail from OAT on 4-3-15 at 10:41 a.m. indicating this: ""Also, if you book an African Safari, we are allowing you to cancel all the way up until the day of departure and receive a full refund.""Any comments?"
Always buy travel insurance. But don't buy from the company your traveling with . If you buy insurance through your travel company you are not covered if the travel company goes bankrupt. Also OAT Insurance is overpriced. go to a site like quotewright and you can compare prices and options from a number of companies.
"We agree!Our group of 10 invested over $50,000 in cash one year in advance (in October 2014) to OAT Travel for a tour to the Galapagos scheduled November 2015. June 30, 2015, an email is sent to the group leader by Grand Circle Travel (the parent company of OAT Travel) that they have cancelled the trip. Each traveler paid over $5000 in cash for the trip one year in advance, but NO FINANCIAL COMPENSATION is offered for their cancellation. They offered for us to travel earlier or in 2016. Reason stated was their boat is broken. However, if they suggested alternate dates that are before our scheduled trip and they are advertising trips to the Galapagos for summer 2015 with substantial discounts (free airfare) for new travelers, the broken boat is probably not the real reason for the cancellation. Individual travelers were not notified of the cancellation. Further, when individual travelers tried to inquire about the cancellation with OAT Travel, they said that our trip was going as scheduled. OAT Travel and its parent company, Grand Circle, seems disorganized and not trustworthy of a large travel investment."
"I flew in Dec. 2014 with Air India, and while it has been accepted back into Star Alliance, I think that it is sub-par. All of the technology did not work (watching movies etc.) I had to try 5 different seats and never found one that worked. The toilets are not too clean, and the food is not that great. I order diabetic meals, and all they serve is steamed veggies, no protein what so ever. I could have had a health problem due to their poor knowledge on diabetic meals."
"Booked my first trip with OAT for next March 4th as a single traveler. Usually make all my own travel plans, so this is a first experience for me. The tour to Inside India came highly recommended from friends, who have had several trips with them. I always get my own insurance and book my own flights. If OAT had booked my flight, it would have cost me $1500.00 from San Francisco to New Delhi R/T. My ticket cost $850.00, booked through cheapair several months in advance. Since I plan well in advance, there is plenty of time to do my homework before a trip. I'm a seventy years young single woman globetrotter, who so far has never had a bad vacation I planned myself. Planning and studying is half the fun and being prepared is avoiding disappointments, or at least keep them to a minimum. Being a retired techie, I take full advantage of the internet, also libraries, embassies, state departments, networking with locals etc. Patience, a great attitude and sense of humor goes a long way anywhere on this planet. After all most problems are self created. Have a great trip and study up!Edited: 4 years ago "
"I totally agree on OAT air itineraries. Connections can include an eleven hour layover in Heathrow or you will need to be an accomplished sprinter to make your flight. If you make the flight, chances are you luggage will not. Three of us were four days in the Masi Mari with only carry on luggage.I was a great fan of OAT, but my last two trips with them were less than stellar. I much prefer Odysseys Unlimited. They are a bit more expensive, but their locations are usually more centerally located, the hotels are better, the food is better, there are no extra fees for excursions, and most tips are included! You get what you pay for.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Seems to me that the poster didn't buy the insurance and then blamed OAT for not doing anything? I have traveled with OAT a number of times (belong to the Edmund Hillary Club), and have had NO insurance incident. I didn't buy insurance. Be it luck. Last year, we booked their Africa package. Because of Ebola, OAT offered to allow us to cancel without penalty. I somehow bought insurance on this particular itinerary, since it was the priciest OAT trip I've booked. In the end, there was also violence at the borders over there, so I cancelled it (my friends also). OAT refunded every penny of our $8K. The insurance concern refunded every penny as well. We have had NO incident with any of our OAT ventures. It's unfortunate that this poster was impacted that way . One MUST look at such incidents OBJECTIVELY. We don't know their scenario in totality, so we can't pass judgement on their misfortune."
Why would you never have anything to do the AARP?
"Patty S., Passing thru Heathrow has always been a nightmare to me. Last time to South Africa (OAT also), we had about 1 hour to transfer from another terminal. We had to reclaim our luggage, board a bus and get over to the other terminal, and had to get our luggage cleared again thru customs. I wrote them a nastygram. We were IN Heathrow already, we HAD to reclaim our own luggage and get them RE-cleared? Absurdity with the British system?"
"I bought their expensive insurance, had to cancel for medical reasons, submitted all documentation, and months later have not been compensated. The OAT linked insurance company says all requirements are fulfilled, and just to be patient. OAT is at least consistent.....they're a lousy company, and their insurance company is, too!"
"GunnerHiltonhead_SC, our insurance experience was NOT with OAT. Our Africa trip was pricey (like $8K+), so we bought the insurance. It was I believe $149 through another agency, perhaps trip insurance store: check this out https://tripinsurancestore.com/ As I said earlier, because of eBola, and the violence over there at the border, we cancelled. We got all our insurance $$ back, minus only $7."
"Thanks for input on insurance, much appreciated. I have been using Travelinsurance.comand pay $193.00 for basic. If you want a ""cancel for any reason policy"", which I only bought once, it will cost a lot more. Also if you travel to countries with civil unrest, make sure your insurance cover the exact category ""civil unrest"", not only ""terrorism"" and ""civil war"", should you unfortunately have the need to cancel for those reasons. As always, the devil is in the details!"
I have not ever heard that OAT & Grand Circle are part of AARP. Have you verified this information with wither of the 3 organizations?I have traveled twice before with OAT and have had all types of issues with their guides.
"I have been on 2 OAT trips so far and have another scheduled in one week. My thinking is that OAT must not compensate their guides adequately because they seem to cater to whoever may give them more $'s. I have heard each guide question folks about their status and then have a tendency to play favorites, Dr, Executive, etc. I have found that that the guides have been very problematic on both trips in many ways.Also, if you are benefiting from there $0 single supplement and a first time traveler, you can expect to get the worst possible room that is available in all of the hotels. I had ones with no AC, safes that were not bolted down but rather just laying in an end table, holes in walls, showers that did not work. Bottom line is that again you get what you pay for. If you saved on not paying the Single Supplement, expect to not get the same treatment as those staying two to a room."
"No James, they do NOT cater to Singles. You are correct that a single would have there own room as compared to a couple. Trust me, I have traveled twice with OAT and a single does NOT get a room that is even close in size, location, amenities, etc. to the couples rooms. I have had sub-par rooms to those on the trips. Yes, I have toured the other rooms and have been greatly disappointed in my rooms. Again, you are getting what you paid for when it comes to OAT. I have spent hours with our guides and hotel staff to just get into a room that was fully operational. Forget about location of the rooms, they were at the end of the hallway, on anther floor or another Bldg. for ""others"". The guides seem to be on vacation when you arrive at the hotels and any changes that are necessary must be done by the traveler."
"Wait a sec, for a single room, don't you pay additional $$? Sometimes, if you're lucky, no single supplement charge. I've traveled with OAT for no less than 5 times, and I don't have a gripe. As far as paying the guides, don't we pay them AFTERwards? at the very end of the tour? How can the guides determine just which to slight? Am I reading the postings wrong? From my personal perspective, all the trips appeared to have been handled fairly.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Elaine B , I can't help but wonder if you had problems with the guides and the rooms, why would you book yet another trip with OAT? My sister traveled a lot with them and was always pleased. They wave the single supplement on some trips."
What kind of person would leave their wallet and passport in their car. Sounds like you weren't thinking.

what did you like about the Patagonia tripEdited: 4 years ago 
I am solo but I do not want paid extra like to go to china .mari1907v@aol.com sept oct
"mari1907v,It is NOT a good idea to post your email on a public forum. You might want to have your post removed."
"I've just read through all the comments and since most of them are negative, I'm a bit concerned. Has anyone been on the Jewels of Bohemia, the Central Europe trip? With all these critical comments, has OAT not responded? The insurance is a big item. I had to cancel the above trip for health reasons 3 yrs ago and was reimbursed according to their schedule. I'm signed up again, but unsure about which insurance to take.Edited: 4 years ago "
"My wife and I bought OAT's trip cancellation insurance for a trip to Japan. We had already traveled on 5 OAT trips and on all of them we had upgraded to Business Class international flights at a considerable expense. On this trip we did the same and paid up front for the upgrades. A few weeks before the trip's starting date they indicated that they were unable to provide the upgraded itinerary and relegated us to coach. We cancelled since now the trip was not what we reserved and paid for which was the Business Class routing. Eventually they refunded the air upgrade money but not the cost of the trip. They said we were obligated to go anyway via economy class and also refused to pay us for our loss even though we had purchased their trip insurance. They just kept our money. Needless to say, we have not traveled with them since this.Be guided accordingly. Trip insurance which doesn't pay is worth less than zero."
"My husband and I have traveled to China, Thailand, Peru, Argentina and Chile and Croatia with OAT and Grand Circle.We have had successful trips and wonderful memories. We are currently planning another trip."
"I'm glad some people are happy, but have only my own experiences from which to judge, and for me, the insurance was a joke. Each trip had a big travel glitch, and NEVER did they assume responsibility, each time dropping the financial loss totally on me. I can neither utilize nor recommend them, ne strongly discourage others from using OAT."
"I agree with gunner, and for us, one failed insurance experience was one too many, as far as I'm concerned."
"naturegal - What did I like about Patagonia? Torres del Paine, period. The ultimate outdoor hike? Well, I've been to many U.S. national parks, so when I went, some 15 years or so ago, it was a fresh adventure. And, it turned out to be very rewarding. I went with Wilderness, and the guide was very knowledgeable; so, we had a great time. He knows people down there. One day, we just stopped by a motel owner's place. In the backyard, they just roasted lamb for us for lunch.... WOW!!!!!!!!!! Great memory."
"gunnerHiltonHead - Insurance coverage is NOT OAT's arena, the insuring operation just hops on the deal, supposedly. IF you do get the insurance, and something happens, it's between you and the insuring agency, not OAT. If anyone's not happy with the outcome, he/she'd have to deal with the insuring side, isn't it, and not OAT?"
In our case we dealt only with OAT and not any insurance company.
"Technically, you are correct. However, the policy was vectored through OAT, and I've been told by people in both the travel and insurance business that they receive a percentage of the insurance fee. So, legally they incur a responsibility, not to mention a moral obligation. So, this last time, when the insurance company told me to take a jump, and OAT said the same, I reported both to the state insurance commission. Darned if THEN they banded together and jointly reimbursed my cancellation. So, yes, I hold OAT responsible for their vendors, and blame them for their failures. I'm using a different travel and insurance company for a $50000+ family Africa trip. Had OAT been ethical in past dealings, they would have been in the running for that business, but...."
"We felt the same way, that after 5 trips in 5 years they just cut us loose and kept our money for the trip and for the insurance, when the reason for the cancellation was their inability to provide the air travel that we paid for in advance. We have taken several international trips since then with other providers which instead could have been with them if they had been even minimally fair with us."
"In a competitive business, bad customer service isn't a good business model."
"Yes, gunnerHiltonHead_SC, good customer service is important in any business perhaps. I've travel with OAT/GCT a number of times, and so far got no gripe. Like anything, those who had problems with them perhaps are few (no offense), for whatever reasons. In other words, I like 'em."
"So did I like 'em, right up till the moment they scr**ed me over, so it is clear to me that OAT does not believe in customer loyalty.My first boss told me that there are an infinite number of people you can sc**w out there and I guess that's one way to operate. I wonder if he learned that from the OAT folks?"
Agree. We talk to people who love them. It's good there are choices!
"Yes, buy insurance, but NOT from OAT - their policy is lousy. Use one of the recommended companies on Insuremytrip.com. I like TravelGuard and a couple of others. The details are critical."
"OAT is a big organization, and it's only part of the Grand Circle organization. I'm sure they have all sorts of issues that pop up at various times. As this is a complicated world we live in, we are assured of mishaps here and there. For those that have had issues, that's unfortunate. As far as insurance goes, I might just add another observation. I found (personal experience) that if you buy trip insurance from other than the organization that's doing the trip, you likely will pay less. I'm not going to mention specific names; perhaps that's taboo in this forum, so.... OAT's gotta earn a cut, which I think is why. By going through an outside agency, you're cutting off the cut for the middle man, so to speak."
"Did you take the Bohemia trip? We are scheduled to go next week. Any tips/recommendations you care to share with us? This is our first OAT trip but we've only heard good things from friends over the years. How dressy do you need to be? Should hubby take a sportcoat (don't want to if it's for only one time). Do they pick up the luggage after breakfast or do we have to put it out the night before? They've changed our hotel in Slavonice to ""Bejckuv Mlyn"" instead of the hotel Dom U Ruze. Sounds like more of a B&B. Mixed reviews on Trip Adv. Appreciate any recommendations on the trip. Thanks.Sandy"
"Sandy I think we are on the same trip. Dressy may be a nice blouse and pants for me. This is my 4th trip with Oat and I have never taken a skirt or dress, except in Morocco where I took one long skirt for its coolness. Some men wear a sports coat but not all. Luggage has never had to be out the night before. Usually before but sometimes after breakfast. I am not happy about hotel switch but Oat does that on a regular basis.If you go to Oats website, there is a forum where you can ask questions. Often breakfast has a 2hr window depending when the breakfast room opens. We all do not eatt breakfast at the same time."
"Thank you both for the very helpful info. We've taken several Vantage trips but since this is our first on OAT, just wanted to see if it isn't about the same re clothes, etc. I try to wear each item at least twice. Last night we talked to a couple from our area that just returned from the Bohemia trip. They said it was wonderful. We are even more excited now. Mathlady, doesn't sound like we're on the same trip as the list of travelers are all from the US. You're probably on the trip just ahead of us. Again, thanks for responding. Hope you have a great trip."
"Sandy I am on the trip that leaves the US on Sept 18 My home is listed as Boston because Oat's computers cannot handle Canada . On my list there is a Sandra from Allen Tx.I am actually keaving on the 14th, to see more of Prague than what the tour covers.Ann"
Great! Look forward to meeting you.
"Two trip with OAT, one very good and one very bad - the second one did not meet their advertisements. When we were in Botswana, they insisted we were in the Okavango Delta even when the pilot who flew us there said we were not. Where's the water? We saw one small stream for about 90 minutes.AT Chobe NP we stayed in a run down fishing camp on the Chobe river, 40 minute drive from Chobe in borrowed jeeps (River View does not have jeeps or guides) and these ""guides"" did not know there way around Chobe. We saw very few elephants in the park with the largest elephant population in Africa.We also had issues with travel in Zambia and Zimbabwe - trip that were supposed to be comfortable and reasonable in length in both cases took a full day out of our schedule.Don't trust them. Those nice people in sales don't have a clue - and I think it is because their own company does not tell them the truth.We asked for a specific circuit and were told they didn't know which circuit a group would take until the last minute. Towe manages of their camps in Africa told me they know which groups are scheduled at the beginning of the calendar year.At a recent marketing event in Denver, one of the OAT executives promised to get back to me with alternatives because of that bad trip and in three months I have heard nothing. Arrogant.And DON""T buy their insurance - you can get much better prices and better coverage fro other sources - try AAA."
"Follow up to 7/7/2015 Negative ReviewAs a follow up to the negative review and experience we had in which OAT cancelled our trip last year, I would like to say that for the most part, OAT eventually offered us an appropriate solution and compensation for their canceling the trip.We were offered full money back for our trip in addition to compensation for our airfare if we purchased the flight on our own. OAT also offered that if we wanted to change the date of our trip, they would compensate us for the cost of changing our flight. Turned out that Delta's airfare did not change so we did not have to follow up on the airfare compensation. Therefore, I don't know how easy the process would have been to get our reimbursement. My only negative feeling now is that all this should have been discussed with us upfront rather than after 2 weeks of pursuing the issue with them. Whether we had insurance or not is not the issue. We're adventure travelers who travel on our own to remote lands. This time, we opted to pay almost double for a planned tour to avoid the hassles of planning on our own. Instead, we got hassled. Anyhow, we are looking forward to our trip and I will post a review of our trip when we return."
The trips are great it is the Boston office that is awful.I have taken 15 trips and just booked #16 which will be my last.
I have had the same problem with the Boston office. The sales people do not have a clue and the the supervisors are arrogant.
"Surprise, I've had several (well, not that many, about 3) dealings (call up) with them, and I have not had such problems. I didn't find them arrogant for sure. Luck of the draw?"
"Being my first time traveling with OAT in March of this year, I have nothing but a great review for our trip leader and the tour in India. Since I always, except for this time, plan my own tours, which are more focused, you can hardly call me an expert on traveling with a group. However, there are a few tips I would like to share with other travelers regarding globetrotting on or off the grid. PLEASE DO NOT PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET ! I booked ""the Golden Triangle Tour"" land only, way in advance. Since I handled my own airfare and insurance, I paid only half the airfare OAT quoted me. When it comes to insurance, I usually get the one also including ""cancel for any reason"". It's a bit more but well worth it.You have to make the financial pros and cons on this one yourself. When traveling to countries with civil unrest, this insurance is a must for me. My Regular Health Insurance covers emergencies in all countries, so I recommend doing your homework before over insuring yourself. About visas I use a company in Arlington, Virginia. I FedX my passport and required paperwork to them, and they handle all the processing and troubleshooting if needed. It's only a few dollars more. Anyone spending a full day at an Embassy waiting for their visas will appreciate this service, especially if you had an appointment at 9 am, and you find yourself spending all day feeding a parking meter still waiting for this appointment to happen. If needed, please make sure you get your vaccinations well in advance, including bringing the paperwork with you. In conclusion have a great trip(s) ! Traveling is a wonderful learning experience, especially if you do your homework before departure. Happy Trails to all!"
"BrittB611 - doing one's homework oneself may pay off handsomely. Airfare, you can have flexibility vs letting OAT do it. But, I recently booked their Kenya/Tanzania trip for next year, I had a hard time finding the right flight, as I couldn't find a comparable one. Of course, there are cheaper ones from those websites out there, but.... there are ""connection"" differences. Somehow, OAT has an inside track, tho their fare is a few bucks more. Perhaps worth it. As far as insurance goes, the OAT trip cost like $8K, the trip insurance they quoted was something like $500. I did my own research (with other friends traveling with also), and our quoted cost was couple hundred less. Don't know if it's because we'll have 4 people. But, at 1/2 savings? Amazing. Oh, in case anyone wonders, the coverage is about the same (from what I can see/read)."
"Glad to read all these comments. My husband and I are both over 65, but we are runners and very active. we've been on a tour once and used a travel agent once. I book my own trips. We are taking a Viking River cruise Sept 2017 and staying at a VRBO after. I've never bought trip insurance and I'm curious to know what type of problems could arise that would be covered under a policy. I'm thinking twice about trip insurance now. Any advice would be appreciated."
"Dutto, buying a travel protection plan can be complicated. Even just considering one company there are options. If you are a AAA member then AAA Travel will help you get what you need and you don't have to book your travel with them. However, did you know that you pay for the services of a travel agent even if you don't use them when you book Viking? Also, AAA has unadvertised discounts on Viking for AAA members, called Member Benefits."
"Personally I never travel without insurance, because I like to learn from other people's mistakes rather than my own. Here is one of many websites to check out <www.travelguard.com>. Being 71 years young and in great health, I don't want to roll the dice and end up crying ""could have, would have, should have"". Enjoy your cruise next year!Edited: 3 years ago "
We have booked directly with various travel companies for our last 5+ trips. We never take insurance with the company that has sold us the tour/trip. My husband and I also like Travel Guard and have had good service from them and parent company AIG. Call for a quote but also get an online quote from them to compare pricing for services.
"Yeah Elaine H, cheaper buying through outside insurance companies (vs the travel co., like OAT). I've bought with couple of companies, and have been very happy, much cheaper also."
"SUE F:Our last trip was not ""great"". We missed numerous things on Ultimate Africa that were in the catalog and on the itinerary. The people in Boston either lied to us or are poorly trained.We have only taken two trips with them and have found other agencies to be much better - can't understand the people that use OAT 6 or 8 or 12 or 15 times. It's like going to the same restaurant or listening to the same song over and over and over and over again."
"Has anybody every paid Overseas Adventure Travel's full cost of the trip by credit card and found out their trip price has been raised? This is OAT's policy if you pay in full by credit card, they can raise your trip price at an unspecified, speculative amount. Has this happened to anybody?"
"OAT's policy is that the final payment for the trip cost they prefer non-credit card payment. IF you pay by credit card, there'd be a surcharge. That's as far as we understand it. We've never paid more than what's been advertised as the price. Yes, we did not read of the fine print that you pay that price by check or cash, and not credit card."
"I've made final payment early November by credit card. OAT offered a discount if paid by cash/check but that wasn't enough to offset the cash back from my cc company. I also wanted AMEX behind me in case i had any issues. Right after I paid my final balance by AMEX, I got a note saying they were no longer accepting them due to the higher fees. MC and Visa still accepted."
"Amex has the best customer care, that's why the fee. Your fee rebate must be tremendous, 'cos I thought paying by check saves more $$."
OAT no longer accepts AMEX :(
"IMHO, save your money and do not buy the OAT insurance. We bought it and when we paid a lot of extra money for Business Class upgrades to Japan, they routed us there and back with 3 long layovers each way, which we rejected as a recipe for delays, and other unnecessary difficulties. Their response was to say , basically, ""take it or leave it"", so we cancelled the trip thinking we would get our money back, since the cancellation was due to their inability (or just laziness) to provide us with a reasonable air routing. They kept all of our money, even the extra money we paid for the Business Class upgrades, as well as the money we paid for the useless insurance, and nothing we did changed their minds. Why should they accommodate us with proper air routes when they can just keep our money and not provide us with anything but agita? That would have been our 5th OAT trip in 6 years(on the 4 other OAT trips there were no problems with our Business Class upgrades and we thoroughly enjoyed the trips ). I am a lawyer and threatened them with legal action. Clearly they did not care and their insurance was useless. Needless to say, we have not gone on any more OAT trips.It is not clear to me that the OP would have gotten a refund even if she had purchased the insurance, since OAT seems to take a very narrow view of what the insurance will cover."
"There is much better insurance available in the market than the OAT insurance (less expensive and through professional organizations).OAT is very inwardly focused, they don't even acknowledge that Tripadvisor exists or that any of their guest could have an issue or bad experience.Their sales people on the phone either are poorly informed or the lie about arrangements on trips.Two trips with OAT and never again - I can't imagine how bad the self image is of all of these people who have taken 3 or 6 or 10 trips with OAT. Feel sorry for them. They just don't understand that there are quality organizations doing great trips all over the world."
"From our experience, we get better coverage and paid less $$ buying insurance through other agents other than the tour operator. My perception is that the tour operator is getting it for you, so they have to have their cut, and hence the extra cost to you/me. This has been our experience. We usually save a significant sum by not getting it with the tour operator.Edited: 3 years ago "
"We have had AMAZING trips on OAT. Will be taking our 10th one to Bhutan next fall. But DO NOT like their expensive trip insurance - will be shopping around. Also, you can usually book air fare on your own for about half the price."
"Business Class upgrades through OAT were much cheaper than we could have purchased on our own at the time of the experience I related. When we arranged our own air travel to and from Peru, OAT only gave us a $100 per person discount in the cost of the trip. I want to stress that we would still be their loyal fans, as we were before, if they had given us a credit towards a future trip with them."
"All we can say is that we took our first OAT trip in September and were totally pleased. Yes, we could nitpick a couple of things but we definitely felt we got our monies worth touring the Czech Rep, Slovakia and Hungary. Our tour guide, Milan was one of the best we've had in traveling for many years. Only wish we'd tried OAT a lot sooner. The maximum 16 people in the group was wonderful compared to land tours with 40 people. Our friends used OAT for their air travel on Business Class and thought they got a great deal. Didn't have any problems with their routing. We generally use Travel Insure and have had a few minor claims which were handled expeditiously, luckily not on this trip altho we came close when husband fell in Budapest. Cannot imagine traveling out of the country without insurance."
"We have taken a number of tours with this company. The tours and tour guides are terrific. We would like to say that the company needs to be more flexible in its policies and the way they handle changes. We need to cancel a tour for a future tour and were charged $300.00. The company also added a $440.00 additional fee for who knows. Will be filling with BBB in Boston since that is the only way you get things right with this company. Air flights, they are not alway the shortest but alway saving $ for the company. If you extend your trip to go off on your own through OAT, check out what is included and what is not ahead of time. And if you have a Back to Back trip make sure you get the extra fees up front do not allow them to contact you later date , you will be surprised . I will also add that after this final tour with OAT, this company has lost another loyal customer for life. NOT WORTH ALL THE TIME AND EFFORT."
I agree with you on the lazy air group. they alway find the cheapest route to make more $ for themselves and do not care about their customers time!
"Hmmmm, hope OAT is reading this discussion thread. I (and some friends) have traveled with OAT a number of times (well, I'm in the ""Club"", so to speak), I've found them to be OK. Yes, their trip insurance rates are over-priced in my opinion (thus, we've researched and came up with much more reasonable prices with other independent insurers). Our next trip is to Kenya. Their airfare price I took as I felt lazy this time; and, probably I wanted to save that 10% or so paying early, but ending up paying more than necessary?). So far, some ads/invites I've got so far seem to be much lower than OAT's price. Well.... anyone who wants the best should consider this 1 company I used sometime back, based in Berkeley?. When I traveled with that co to South America, etc., I thought they were very good. But.... they're much pricier than OAT. Money drives the game often. OAT has to be in the black, so.... but I find that they're at least within reason OK or good."
"I would not necessarily agree that Odysseys Unlimited has better hotel locations. Compare the tour of Portugal and Spain Pousadas and Paradores accommodations and you'll see the identical ones on OAT. In fact, our hotel in Lisbon on Odysseys tour was far away from the tourist area but OAT had a great hotel location in Alfama, where it's the most interesting section of Lisbon. Also, Odysseys doesn't seem to interact with the locals as much as OAT which always makes the tour more rewarding. I would still prefer an OAT tour over the Odysseys Unlimited. Odysseys Portugal & Spain tour felt like a standard rushed bus tour with no interesting side trips, and Odysseys tours can have up to 24 people and OAT limits most tours to 16."
"I just read all the reviews and i'm really suprised. I am about to leave on my 15th trip with OAT as a single traveler. I have had no complaints . Sure, there have been decisions by guides that i didn't agree with, and there have been travelers that i wish were NOT on my trip, but taken as a whole, OAT has been great and the prices, at least for a single, are more than competitive. That said, i use my brain when i travel. I don't expect my travel provider to take the place of my mom. I check on insurance prices and have always used a different company than the one OAT offers. I find out their air price and route and compare to what i have found on my own..and always factor in the cost to get from the airport to the hotel. I did have a price shock on my Japan trip regarding the cost to get from the airport to the hotel but when i complained OAT people called me and explained why it cost so much and then told me exactly how to make the transfer on my own for less cost. OAT is pretty clear that if you pay up front in cash and not credit card you get a discount. If you didn;t understand that it is your fault for not reading the material. I have traveled on my own to countries where i didn;t feel the need for a guide, i have found a guide on line and just showed up (in Rwanda), and i have tried a couple of other companies and i am very very satisfied with OAT and would recommend them. Sometimes things just happen, some people will never be happy, and sometimes everything goes well all on its own. Isn't that part of the whole adventure travel process? if you really want to be pampered there are plenty of companies who say they do that and they charge a lot for it. Thats not my style. Although i really don't think age is any indicator of how a person responds to problems/surprises while traveling since it has been brought into this discussion i will tell you that i am72 years old (not 72 years young which i find to be very condecending) , and have run through airport because of delays etc and have been just fine. Not all goes well when you travel. my flight from China was late for arrival in LA and i had to wait 6 hours to get a flight to Denver and then almost missed my flight from Denver to MInneapolis. It wasn't anyone's fault. Flights get delayed sometimes. We all know that. If you can't roll with it, don't do the trips.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I ditto Janelouise2014 here. I've traveled with OAT, and I have NO gripe with them. My next trip is coming up, for Kenya/Tanzania. We actually signed up 2 years ago, then Ebola struck, OAT permitted us to cancel without penalty. We signed up again now because Ebola pretty much is under control (I hope!); and it never was a problem over there vs. the West African area, but.... we tried to be prudent about it. OAT has been very good I'd say, esp. I could get free single room accommodation, saving $$. I've also traveled with Wilderness, and they're good too, but much pricier. I wouldn't even think of National Geographic or Linbladt. They're far too expensive for me (may be I've been missing a lot!?). I like to bump around, explore myself where I can (in a foreign country I'm more conservative perhaps, so I'd often go with guided tours), the need to pay for a naturalist accompanying me/us is unnecessary (personally speaking). OAT is good. Like any other business, it's a competitive world out there, IF OAT is short, they wouldn't be around for too long. Of course, there will always be shortcomings here and there. Who's looking for perfection? That perhaps can be accomplished living in a vacuum? LOL"
"You ""may have"" read way too much into the responses from other folks with assuming that folks ""need to be pampered"". There is some degree of support that should be allotted to the traveler while traveling with OAT. I am talking about once you are picked up at the airport by OAT personnel and taken to OAT lodging. My husband and I believe that OAT does not adequately screen their main guides on an ongoing basis. Too much lee way is given to the guide and the regional office until it is too late and something detrimental happens. We have found that the inter country, secondary guides are generally very good. You are lucky if you have not seen/experienced any issues/problems. Others have even suspected that OAT does not pay the main guides enough and instead wants the traveler to reward them with big tips. Many have called the Boston office before/during/after the trip in an attempt to get answers or resolve to a problem and you often are passed around rather aimlessly. I agree that OAT's prices are ""fair"" as compared to other travel companies but remember that you often get what you pay for."
"Hi Mike. I do agree with many of the points that you make and especially in regard to the ""extra charges"" that come as a surprise. I have thought that with all of the problems with OAT for the 3 trips that my husband and I have taken, it may well be our last trip too. Their guides are some of the worst that I have experienced. We toke a trip to Africa in October and the guide did not reside in the country but was only a yearly visitor. He grew up in the country but now lived in Europe. EH returned to see family and friends and seemed to more interested in his own endeavors. He did not wish to share information when asked and another guide said that he was just plain ole' lazy!! Try dealing with asking a guide to share information as a learning experience when he just does NOT care!!"
"We are researching several tour operators for a tour to Morocco in 2018; Any suggestions?We always purchase trip insurance from Amex (we book via their OPKS agent Winggate Travel) and with the various comments we are concerned that OAT may not be a great choice for 2 reasons:1. their physical requirements as listed in their catalog is a bit confusing when they list using a ladder to access a vehicle (?) and walking up to five miles a day....2. As read, the complaints here and the BBB site are concerning.We have toured both Australia and China extensively and have never walked 5 miles at one time; the most we walked was a tour of Uluru in the outback.....a few miles, it could have been 3 or 4.....anyway any suggestions would be helpful!"
"@ charles # 100 physical req says 2 to 3 miles ( not 5) , Not sure about the ladder, I took this trip and there was no need for a ladder, The 4x4 are sometimes higher to step into but I would still call them steps/not ladders, BTW, it was a great trip but they seem to have cut out one night in the desert, The reason I chose it was because OAT was one of the few companies to offer 3 nights in the desert,"
"My wife and I went on OAT's Morocco trip a few years ago and loved every minute of it.The ladder is to get on top of the vehicles to access where your baggage will be stored.IMHO, 2 nights in the desert are enough. The question I'd ask is what has been substituted instead of that 3rd desert night?One day in the desert we walked for about 3 or 4 miles, but the hike was optional. It also was fascinating.Hope you enjoy the trip as much as we did!"
Thanks! That info helps......cp
"Charels P., comments regarding a tour operator sometimes have to be dissected. Those making the complaint perhaps were not suited for a particular trip.... Between me and other friends, we've traveled with OAT quite a number of times, and we have had no beef about them. Yes, some gripes may be legit, but.... perhaps we were not looking for perfection, so... we generally had good outings. As to whether you walk or not, one would have to study the trip itinerary details. There are trips that require extensive walking. For example, with Wilderness Travel, their trips are for hikers/walkers, so you'd walk a lot, vs a Grand Circle Tour trip, which would bus you round throughout the trip. We've done both. A Wilderness Patagonia trip, for example, we hiked for 11 miles 1 day (R/T).... So, take one's poison, so to speak. As for insurance, the tour operator's offerings usually are higher, yes. Check out Trip Insurance Store (dot com). I've insured with them, and they are GOOOOOD, saving$$ also. Bon voyage!"
"As I have stated elsewhere on this forum, OAT's trip insurance turned out to be worthless when we needed it, so skip it and save your money."
Thanks to all for your insights ! Really appreciate you taking your time.......cp
Thank you for the detailed information; all the replies have been very helpful! Thank you all!
"RJP, well said. I totally agree with your comments. I just came back from Tanzania, my 14th trip with OAT as a single. Some of my rooms have been smaller than the couple rooms (and why not, i didn't have to pay a single supplement so something has to give), but for the most part there has been no difference. I have had 2 guides that were not top notch. One was fairly new and it was easy to see that she was very very concerned that she was not going to get a ""meets expectations"" on the post travel survey. To compensate she kept telling us not to expect to much. It was funny, but it also made the trip discussions pretty negative. The other guide was too worried about keeping on schedule so he did not give the spontaneity that is one the great things about OAT trips. I usually take the OAT airfare and then see if i can do better. I usually can, so i just cancel the OAT air (within their timeline, of course). I think the main reason their insurance is so expensive is because they have the ""cancel for any reason"" coverage. I don't need that so i get my own coverage either thru the ""insure my trip"" website or the ""Square mouth"" website and get exactly what i fell i need.The Morocco question puzzles me. I took that trip in the fall of 2015 and i didn't climb any ladders. We did do a fair amount of walking because we walked through the souks and the various Mosques, temples etc but it wasn't like we were taking a hiking vacation.Anyway, i Like OAT as a single traveler and altho i certainly do not go with them every time i travel i feel very comfortable recommending them. You also have to remember that there are a lot of people out there can can find fault with with lots of things and then complain about it through social media. Always take complaints with a grain of salt."
"Jane, OAT does NOT have cancel for any reason coverage as I've written here before. We cancelled because OAT could not provide reasonable flight scheduling to and from Japan and we did not get our money back!"
"Again, thanks for all the replies......1 clarification, the question I had about the need to climb ladders came from OAT catalog description of the requirements for their Moroccan trip."
"When we went on the OAT Morocco trip, our luggage, which consisted of soft-sided duffel bags, was stacked on top on the vehicles. To access the top there were ladders built into the sides of the vehicles, and once or twice I went up there to retrieve something. Usually the guides or drivers took care of those things, and I'm sure someone would have gone up there if I had asked, so I'm not sure why OAT would expect passengers to be able to climb up there."
Thanks! That clears that up!
"I signed up for an upcoming Kenya/Tanzania's trip primarily because of the free single feature. So, I had to give in for the lack of Masa Marai, which OAT offers only as an EXPENSIVE pre- or post- option (they're milking it here we thought). For this I could complain because the great migration should be standard with any Ka\enya/Tanzania outing, I thought. Well..."
"Well, with all of these perspectives, I can certainly understand investigating all tour operators! Thanks again for everyone's insight!"
"I too had a very unfortunate and costly experience with OAT. We did not purchase insurance for a trip to Australia & NZ and my husband fell deathly ill 10 days before our trip and was hospitalized. His physician wrote a letter stating that he could not travel. Even with a doctor's note and a request for either partial reimbursement of the $18,000+ trip OR some credit towards another OAT adventure, we were turned down cold. We had booked our airfare separately and were able to get a refund, minus a penalty, but OAT was adamant that we were getting nothing. We will NEVER take a trip with OAT again and are advising our traveling friends of the callous and cold response from the ""executive committee"". BEWARE!"
"Sorry to read about your experience......we learned a long time ago to book all of our trips via our long relationship with a local travel agent (we book via Amex exclusively) ........we've never had an issue they couldn't resolve within a day. Anyway, good luck with your future travel plans."
"That's really unfortunate, but the fact is, you did not purchase trip insurance . That problem is on you, not OAT. I would never book a trip with OAT or anyone else without purchasing insurance from someone. You can't expect a tour company to take a financial hit for you because you decided not to spend the extra money to insure your trip."
"@suba- what person let alone a senior travels w/o insurance? That is very foolhardy, You have only yourselves to blame and not OAT, Beware of your own foibles,"
"We bought OAT's trip insurance and they failed to pay us back (yes, kept everything we had paid them) when we cancelled our Japan trip because they claimed they could only route us through 4 cities, with hours or layovers, from Newark to Tokyo. We were very surprised, to say the least. Now we don't buy any trip insurance and since we started that, we've saved a lot of money. I think trip cancellation insurance is just a clever ruse to separate more of your money from your wallet. So many people seem to feel otherwise, but I wonder how many actually have collected from such a policy, and how much money most would save by forgoing the insurance and self-insuring.Don't everyone jump on me--I'm just relating my own personal experience with OAT."
"I understand your reluctance to expand on your choice not to use trip insurance. Some individuals seem to enjoy others' unfortunate experience. I would just ignore those crass comments. This forum is for sharing information, not piling on. Stiff upper lip and all that!"
"I don't understand what the problem is, about the add on for the Tanzania trip. Please explain in more detail.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I have traveled with OAT several times and have always bought my own travel insurance outside of what OAT offers. I go onto a website like www.insuremytrip.com and compare policies. I always buy travel insurance for the possibility that something unforeseen may happen before my trip that prevents me from going or that I may fall ill or fall and injure myself while on my trip and require medical care and may need medical evacuation back home. Maybe people don't realize how much medical evacuation really costs if you need it or that you might be paying more money to change your return ticket back home. Not sure why anyone would take the risk of not having travel insurance but to each their own. Personally, I don't have that kind of money in my bank account to take that risk."
"I agree. BUy insurance but not through OAT - you'll find it less expensive and you won't have to deal with the OAT, you'll be dealing with an insurance company that specializes in insurance. If you belong to AAA - they sell it as does many other insurance companies.I just spent time in Arusha, Tanzania as part of a safari trip and you do not want to have to go to a hospital there. In a lot of the world, it's the family of the patient that provides meals, linen, water etc for someone on the hospital - and you'll want a good strong company that understands this in such a situation.A couple of months ago there was a plane crash in the Serengeti and they took the injured to Nairobi because the health care is better there."
"We loved our travels with OAT, but their insurance was useless when we cancelled our Japan trip because they routed us there from EWR with 3 stops/layovers each way. This after we paid them a fortune for Business Class upgrades. OAT refused to reconsider the routing and refused to refund our money, and refused to honor their own insurance.This was the only time in all our nearly fifty years of travels all over the world, including many trips to Africa, South America, Asia, etc., where we purchased travel insurance. I am sure that we have saved enough from not paying for insurance that we have been able to travel so much more. Of course we have taken chances, but from my experience with OAT, I cannot see ever paying for this insurance. It's like flushing money down the toilet, IMHO.My son is a partner in a large international law firm which represents many insurance companies. His job is to try to limit what those insurance companies pay out in benefits, including travel insurance. He tells me, from his 15 years in this field, that travel insurance is one of the most profitable lines of insurance now sold, at least in the USA. Just keep this in mind when you next consider whether or not to buy travel insurance."
"My friends and I have had terrific experiences with OAT, and as previously stated, the guides are terrific."
Has anyone done the OAT Japan tour? What was your experience? Are the hotels satisfactory or shoeboxes? Do you get any help with luggage or do you haul it all?
"Insurance is one of those necessary evils in life at times. One buys it, but would pray that it'd never be utilized for disastrous reasons. The insurance companies hire all those smart actuaries to cover all angles to ""minimize"" payback to the customer, if not totally avoiding to have to pay. In my travel experiences, it's always MORE expensive if one buys travel insurance with the trip organizer. Perhaps that's why there's other companies that are willing to offer lower rates. When I was younger, I just didn't think of getting insurance to cover my trips, and had been lucky. In recent years, as I aged, I got more careful, sort of, and started buying it, tho with agents other than the tour company. I pay much less in premium. And luckily, or not so, I've had to file claim several times in recent years, and have been successful without hassle from the insuring companies. Of course, anytime you have to cancel a trip, you lost already. The insurance premium is not ""covered"".Edited: 3 years ago "
Not happy with their customer service. We had complaints about our first trip with them. Took the pre-trip and had to pay for a guided tout during the pre-trip. It was over priced. They put us in a hotel that was not a good location to eat dinner. We had to pay for taxis or train fare to eat dinner or buy food in the supermarket. Another group in the same city as us were put up in a centrally located hotel for the same price. Gave us misinformation as to our return trip. After numerous phone calls when we returned we were told no compensation available in cash or credit on a future trip. Done with them. Sorry i didn't read the reviews before I booked. Would never had picked them.
Thanks for your post! We were cnsidering the much paised company foora trip to Japan. Will never try them after reading your report!!! Thanks Trip Adviser for publishing travellers' experences!
"hanks for your post. We will never travel with this company!! We got pressured on the phone to buy their insurance, which was almost double from thecsum our insurance company charges. My husband was very upset about the pressure and decided he dd not want to do any business with them. o glad he was right!"
"I agree with you totally and have had a lot of problems and issues with OAT over the years. Get insurance outside of OAT and protect yourself. Yes, buyer beware. It is a great deal of work to penetrate OAT management. We have had to on occasion and it was not fun."
"You are smart not to try OAT after reading the reviews. My husband I had lots of negative travel experiences with OAT. We have taken two trips together and then we each went on a trip separately. There have been many issues with hotel rooms, the lack of clean available water, very bad tour guides, etc. If you are willing to accept sub-standard rooms and undertrained/dogmatic guides then try OAT but buyer beware. We have purchased insurance from other than OAT with Travel Guard and feel that it was a wise choice. We had to use the insurance on 2 occasions. If you have any problems while on the trip, the local office does not want to hear it and the main Boston office is hard to get their ear. If you have any complaints and try too hard to resolve it, the local personnel will tell you to pack your bags and go home. I have experienced OAT deciding that people could not continue the trip and handing them return flight tickets. NO further discussions and the decisions to return state side is made for you!!!! Nice treatment."
"Jesse, I couldn't agree more. I will soon be taking my 15th tour with OAT as a single traveler and have not had any of the issues that have been presented here. Maybe it's because i travel a lot, both with small group tours and independently , and know how things work when you travel overseas. I really am not sure. My absolutely worst tour was with a tour group for women only. The places we were supposed to visit and the experiences we were to have were totally misrepresented. Nothing like that has ever happened with OAT. I have 2 other non oat trips this year and will then be traveling with them next January so i'll have a bit more experience with other companies and will certainly share any insights i think are useful. Note that i say ""useful"" . Sharing rants is not useful. Rants say a whole lot more about the person ranting then about the ""rantee""."
"Thanks for your ostive post. We booked a tour with OAT and we got quite worried after reading the negative commentary. Any good, reliable Travel Insurance company that you can recommend?"
"Thanks. I would be very suprised if you encounter any problems with OAT so i wouldn't worry. They are a very large company with a lot of trips so there are bound to be issues from time to time but the percentage is very very small.I would go to a travel insurance consolidator like smartmouth and Insure my trip. They have lists of policies available and you can choose what you really want/need to insure and then compare with other companies they have listed. I generally end up with Travel Guard but i have CSI for my trip in June. For me, the big issues are trip cancellation for Specific issues like illness, illness in the family etc. Cancellation for any reason costs too much. Also i want the insurance to get me(or my body)back home if necessary. My medical insurer covers emergency care while out of the country so i don't worry about tht. The only claim i have ever had was for a cancelled flight, which got me partial reimbursement with no real hassle so i'm not the one to ask about claim service. Just stick with major insurers with good ratings. It still costs too much as far as i'm concerned but that's insurance..... Think 2 weeks in Ireland cost me about $450, but i'm 72 so they figure i'm due for some major medical issues (They are wrong!). Have fun on your OAT trip."
"Follow up to 7/7/2015 Negative Reviewand Sep 25, 2016, 8:01 PMWe completed our Ecuador trip in October 2016. Most of our group dropped out due to the cancellation. However, the remaining group was pleased with the trip. The trip leaders make the trip. They are excellent and well trained. We had a great time and would consider using OAT again. Still annoyed with the corporate attitude of OAT, but they try to maintain an image of being a small company despite being owned by Grand Circle. I recommend OAT for a trip like the Galapagos where the logistics are complicated, but I don't think it would be worth the cost for a simpler trip such as to Europe."
"I completely agree that i wouldn't use OAT for a Europe trip. I would not use any tour group for Europe, or some Central american countries either. Leave the Tour groups for countries you would be uncomfortable going to on your own."
"This is the problem with OAT, Grand Circle and their ilk. These companies don't work with retail travel agents so when something goes wrong there is no one who can advocate for you. When something goes wrong, your travel agent will work with the tour company to resolve situations like the one mentioned. Mainstream tour companies rely on their reputations to insure their travelers have a positive experience. These companies negotiate with hotels and other land operators well in advance so that prices in their brochures don't require ""currency fluctuation"". And, has anyone on an OAT trip received a refund if the fluctuation is in the traveler's favor. Why didn't they provide you with your airline tickets? They probably returned them to the airline and kept the refund. The idea that OAT and GC programs are cheaper is false. Most other mainstream companies can be less. Do a comparison. None of the mainstream companies ask you to sign a document to indemnify them from legal action."
"We have used OAT in the past with good results. Now it seems that they will not respond to e-mails nor return calls that we have requested (even left voice messages with higher ups in the corporate organization). This has been for the last 2 weeks. Our Daughter has Leukemia and as such we must cancel an upcoming trip but we cannot, as I referenced above, to respond to our calls or e-mails. We do plan on re-booking the trip once this crisis is over but now, given the fact that they will not respond to us, I don't know."
So sorry to hear about your daughter! I wonder why they don't respond. Maybe you should try to call as if you are interested in making a new reservation! It always r\takes a long time to reach them/
"Not to be discouraging; I am still waiting for them to ""get back to me"" from over a year ago for events on Ultimate Africa that never happened.A ""supervisor"" at OAT told me they do not recognize Tripadvisor. and they do not participate in any relevant professional or industry organizations. They=t should have been a red flag to all of us waiting for follow up/help.And I too wish you and your family the best ."
"Sorry to hear about your daughter, ego0131. With OAT, I often feel frustrated when I want to hear from them. On the website, I think there is a link somehow to write to them. But, for the several times i tried, I just never received a response. May be that's a problem with their IT staff, who knows? So, in emergency, I just call them up, via their toll-free number.Edited: 3 years ago "
"goldizsts - Their toll-free (the only number available) is the one, at times, I have been on hold > 85 before hanging up that I have called. I also left a voice-mail for their owner and other higher-ups...no responce..."
"I've been lucky I guess, as far as I can recall, calling them up I had been able to talk to someone. Overall, I'd say it's OK, but not overly impressed as far as quality measurement goes. My honest assessment?, OAT perhaps needs to improve in the customer relations department? It's a competitive business, pretty much, so one wonder why they don't make an effort in the customer satisfaction department."
"We are truly very disappointed to hear about this attitude to customers. We heard a lot of praise for OAT. Some of our friends went to many trips wit them and are very happy with the trips. I hope we will not encounter problems! If wee do, I think formal complaints should be submitted to the BBB and to the Attorney General Trip Advisor is also a wonderful wa of making tings known. Since we already bought the trip, we just have to hope all will be wll...Thanks to Trip Advisor, we did NOT buy the trip insurance ith OAT..."
"As I said earlier, somewhere in this site, I have been happy with OAT. Yeap, never buy their trip insurance. They tend to be more expensive than if one were to buy on his/her own (in my case it is so!). I am due to do their Kenya/Tanzania trip soon, I didn't get insurance through them, but because of laziness or what I authorized them get my own plane ticket, which I'd say is more than if I were to dig up a plane ticket myself. Somehow, this time, I just lazed up!!!!!!!!"
"Trouble contacting OAT?- go to their webite- go to their forum discussion section and post a thread, The site has moderators who seem to be able to get problems /questions answered,"
"Glad I read these posts. I almost booked with OATS. Friends use them and recommended. But I have misgivings about a company that does not use travel agents. No competition, no extra perks, and no advocate if OATS does you wrong. For example, we never book a cruise through the cruise line. We get much better prices and extra perks through competition with on-line travel agents. And did you ever wonder how OATS can offer solo travel at such a reasonable price? Maybe it is reflected in the cost to the other travelers. AND never, never buy travel insurance from the travel company or cruise line. We get OATS literature in the mail. On two occasions I called to book a special deal and waited 20 minutes before I finally hung up. There are lots of travel companies out there that beat their prices and have better response."
"Do not buy OAT travel insurance with Trip Mate promoted on its website. My boyfriend spent $700 on trip insurance with Trip Mate because it was suggested on the OAT website. A month before the trip he was diagnosed with head and neck cancer that would require two months of the most painful and life changing treatment (chemo that left him with a painful rash and very sensitive to the sun, radiation that left him unable to eat solid foods and may have required a feeding tub directly into the stomach). He immediately called OAT who said they could give him a voucher towards future trips. However, he had paid $$$ to purchase travel insurance. He was completely within the terms of the insurance contract. He has spent the last 6 months gathering doctors' reports and other information required by Trip Mate. After six months, his claim was denied because they said he wasn't really sick and could have gone on the trip! Now, I am pursuing legal action and filing a complaint with the insurance commissioner. It seems Trip Mate as an absolutely horrible reputation and this is common practice. My question is: If cancer doesn't qualify as an illness then what does?"
"Christine L., why did he go through OAT, when he was insured via Trip Mate? I just received my refund from Trip Mate for my cancelled trip to Iceland because of an illness. I contacted Trip Mate, and they gave me the forms (via the Internet) to be filled out. I had my doctor complete part of the claim form and sent it out. It did take Trip Mate folks a while (they have to ""investigate""???), but I got my check for the trip cost. Of course, I still lost out, having paid the insurance to begin with. I thought it was a smooth claim. My trip was not with OAT though. But, OAT doesn't underwrite the policy, why'd I have to go through OAT. I have an OAT trip coming up, but I bought the insurance coverage through another company, cheaper, and hopefully will not have an unfortunate experience like your friend."
"Like Jesse, I attended an OAT luncheon and met people who have been drinking the OAT kool aid who seem to buy travel based only on price. At that luncheon, two OAT executives promised to respond when I told them my latest trip had some real disasters. Neither have fulfilled their promise.I believe the the culture at OAT is ""we do nothing wrong, therefor we never have to apologize"".Twice, five years apart, we took Ultimate Africa. The first one was terrific. The second one was terrible based on our previous experience. The guide was good, two of the safari camps were good, some of the guides were good: one place did not even have guides, and the food was all over the place. They said we were in the Okavango Delta, but the pilot who flew us there said we were not, she should know, she's flying an airplane. In Boston they would not even comment."
"Tours great - Telephone Contact BAD!.... My issue is their TELEPHONE SERVICE... I wanted to change my airfare for trip in 2018.. TELEPHONE TIME WAITING WAS 2 HOURS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON..then they were closed.. Tried again Monday 9 am (ET) opening time and STILL WAITING almost 2 HOURS!!!! Telephone Service is really bad!! Anyone have a better telephone number where I will not have to wait 2 hours, it is just too much!!!! Need to really warn people about the REALLY LONG waits on telephone and/or tell everyone to find another organization to book your airfare....."
"PLEASE can you contact OAT and suggest to them to hire more staff to answer the telephone..... airfare should be answered in less than 10 minutes, not 2 plus hours.....What would someone do in an emergency? Would they have to wait 2hours at a phone booth or ???? cell phone with international calls at 10c or more per minute!!"
"OAT should be reading these postings!? Their telephone support I find not too bad for the times I've called. Here and there, I did have to wait. They still don't have an email link on their website for us to send inquiries, etc. in. Scratching my head there. That should justify hiring additional staff to keep in touch with customers, etc. Perhaps they just don't want to do that for whatever reason.Just came back from their Kenya/Tanzania safari trip. FANTASTIC. The main guide was good, the 2 main drivers were very knowledgeable, and they never hesitated to shower us with their knowledge and advice. Highly recommended. Perhaps my best foreign trip thus far. I didn't do the $530 balloon flight/ride. I thought it was dry season, and I was right. There was NO great migration because of that. So, the balloon ride couldn't have been that spectacular. Also, there was no sunrise that day either, very foggy for a couple of days. Besides, taking photos from up on a balloon isn't that desirable. The shake, the moving balloon..... though my friend said ""You should be ther!"". We never went further, if he was pulling my leg or not. Otherwise, it was just a superb outing. Somehow, the people we encountered were very down-to-earthly, esp. the kids. We had a teacher with us. She just was bowled over by the kids waving at us each time we came across them."
OVERSEAS ADVENTURE TRAVEL Please remember as you travel to any foreign county - their County their Rules! I went to Peru in March and as un-luck would have it I was “bumped” just below the ankle bone while waiting to pick up my luggage; didn't realize I was hurt until I started to walk and was limping; pain was gone the next day so I toured Lima then went on to the (pre-trip) Amazon. Since it was NOT better I decided to see a Clinic in Lima before heading for Southern Peru / Bolivia. Clinic took an X-Ray and Dr told me NOT to continue. I had Trip Mate Travel Insurance. While at the Clinic - they wanted paid in CASH ( for the Dr and the X-Ray - a credit card was NOT accepted. Trying to get the Claim settle was a nightmare; I ended up filing a claim with the Missouri Insurance Commission. The amount of the refund I received and the amount I figured I was due were different. After being on terminal hold forever with Trip Mate more times than I care to count I finally signed the check they issued. I feel it was better than the hassle and the amount to hire a lawyer would not be worth the cost - I checked. Re the Missouri Insurance Commission I was told by many they were helpful - I really didn’t find that so. As for OAT - they sold you the trip; they are aware of the problems with Trip Mate however they informed me they are not that bad as they keep track of the issues.In addition I canceled a trip to OAT India -my Trip Mate Travel Insurance purchased thru OAT went back to OAT as a Travel Voucher good for one year? They finally put it on another trip. Seems like a strange business policy to me since I paid for Trip Mate Travel Insurance out of my pocket. Shop your Travel Insurance most of them pay after your Medicare and Supplementary Insurance pay.It is my understanding that many hospitals/clinics/Drs do NOT take travel insurance - you have to pay it out of pocket - tough IF you travel alone. Many want Cash.My next trip is to OAT China - I’ve contacted the Chinese Tourism Board to see if I can purchase Travel Medical Insurance in their Country that would be accepted - to date I have not received an answer.I’m really not sure how to proceed on purchasing travel insurance that will cover me in Country without me having to pay Cash (especially if they don’t take a credit card). Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I really don’t need anymore of these expensive life lessons.As for OAT - for the most part they have great overseas guides however remember when in a foreign county -THEIR COUNTRY - THEIR RULES.
"IMO, medical insurance in China is far inferior to the U.S. perhaps from the consumer's angle. So, be cautious. Insurance is an animal where the actuaries got (perhaps) all angles calculated to reduce the insurer's risk. The fine prints may be hard to understand also. In general, in a foreign country, you'd have to pay first, and hope to get reimbursed. You'd be hard-pressed to find a place that would accept American coverage up front? You pay the insurance, and still pray nothing major happens."
"Ref: consumeradvocate.org/Travel/Insurance lists the 10 best Travel Insurance for 2017. I try to do my homework as much as possible. Since I'm traveling a lot this year, I'm now checking out the various big hospitals in all the countries, who take credit cards and who doesn't. The various embassies have been very helpful so far,also doctors and dentists. I also bring an extended medical kit. So far I haven't needed it myself, however, it has come in handy for other passengers on occasion. Wish I could be of more help. Happy Trails...Britt"
"There's the seasoned traveler. Just 1 comment: with respect to insurance, buying it through the travel operator with whom one books is not as good as getting it through a direct approach, even tho the insurance agent is still a middle man. It seems to me that it's at least cost-wise more advantageous. I've recently had 2 insurance claims for trip cancellation, both times due to medical issues, and I've had no problem getting the whole trip refunded. Of course, I'd still lose out, as the premium paid is a sunk cost. Well... can't have everything!"
"Check out Square Mouth"" or Insure My Trip"" They have policies from a lot of different companies and you can compare to see what it costs to get what you want. It's pretty typical to have a policy that states that the emergency medical coverage is ""secondary"" to whatever coverage you already have. If you want it to be primary you generally pay more. As far as ""cash ony"" goes, that depends a lot on the country you are in. Even though my bank card charges fee if used at a bank outside their system i always carry it with me in the event that i need cash for medical....or whatever. Of course, i've been in countries where they do not have ATM's so that can be a problem. Some policies will advance cash to you for medical expenses. I'm sure there is a fee for that, but if the unexpected happpens it's good to know. Also, the embassy, the tour guide and maybe other travelers can be of help. Fortunately i've never needed medical care but it's a eally really good idea to check the policy you buy very thoroughly so there are no suprises. Lately i've been purchasing CSA which is insured by Generali. which is an International insurance company. My medical coverage is secondary to my U,S, coverage but that's fine with me. I also only have trip cancellation dure to death or illness of me or others in my family plus a few other things. I don't want to pay for ""cancell for any reason"". I never buy the tour groups coverage. always muach too pricy and really not worth it. as far as i'm concerned if i could ge trip cancellation and medical evac and repatriation ONLY that is what i'd get. I can handle the rest. Be a good consumer and there is less chance for suprise."
"I have never traveled with OAT and I will not be. I have had to cancel a trip for medical reasons. I DID buy their insurance for $599, but just try to get your money back! They have told me the wrong amount, and then when I try to talk to them, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a real person on the phone. I've probably spent 5 hours so far just on hold with OAT, and haven't even gotten to the insurance claim part. Maybe they have wonderful trips, but I'm not going through this again."
"As I have written before on these forums, my wife and I took 5 OAT trips and cancelled the 6th because OAT could not provide us with a reasonable flight schedule to and from Japan--they wanted us to have 3 stop-overs with long delays between flights each way. We had purchased their trip insurance and they did not honor it. Needless to say, that was our last OAT trip!"
"I've only taken one trip with OAT but have another booked. I did a 19 day 'Inside Vietnam' tour. I had never done a group tour so was very leery as I am/was a photographer and traveled all over the world solo (no expense account). I booked my own airfare from LAX - total for 19 days...I mean total door-door was $2800 including air with no single supplement. It was a fantastic trip. Our guide was fabulous. He was familiar with American slang, world politics, Vietnamese history and spoke flawless English. Our group was only 14 people. I've been to over 40 countries, and I was only in the middle of the pack with countries visited.Yes..their phone service is rather dreadful, however when I finally did speak to someone they could not have been more helpful. They took their time with me and answered all my questions. I did not buy their insurance rather a higher rated company that only cost $200. Yes,t they are woefully neglectful when it comes to answering emails. I don't know how you would contact them in case of an emergency. I will post a review when I return from Croatia."
"A week or so, received a letter from the Lewis's (owner/founder), saying they're upgrading their answering system. Let's see. Can't imagine they've neglected that part for soooo long though. As ""mark g"" mentioned, when you do get someone on the wire, it's usually very good. Now, the online service is not so good either. Say, on my own account at their site, or even outside of my account, there is NO connection to send them a message. They just have to ""staff"" it I guess. But... of course, it's cost $$$ (significant I'm sure). Well, OAT is not a bad outfit. We just did a 17-day safari to Kenya/Tanzania, and it was fantastic. Besides animals galore, the guide was excellent, and the assisting drivers/guides were also fantastic. 1 of the better if not the best (I haven't done all their itineraries of course) they have to offer. There have been complaints registered here at TripAdvisor, but I have none. Those complaints we honestly don't know the background details (besides not being there 1st hand), so judgement I'd have to withhold, since I have had good experience with OAT."
Got the same letter - fingers crossed.
single rooms are much smaller than the couple double rooms.
<<single rooms are much smaller than the couple double rooms.>> not necessarily. I used OAT for a safari and every room I had was as big or bigger then the couples rooms.
"I agree that single rooms are not necessarily smaller when you travel with OAT. On safari rooms were mostly the same size. Same goes for most small ship rooms. In hotels there is a difference but the single does not necessarily get the smaller room. They try to give the best rooms to the ""frequent travelers"" kinda of like Airline perks..only you ""may"" get the nicer room so nothing is guaranteed. That said, who cares if you get a smaller room as long as it is not noisy or something. Very little time is spent in the room, and quite frankly the people who say ""let me look at your room"" so that they can do some kind of comparison (yes, it has happpened ..amazing) probably should focus more on the adventure than the room. Actually i was just on a Country Walkers tour and paid a single supplement and got a really creepy room in one of the hotels so there is never any kind of guarantee..Edited: 3 years ago "
"In future (and for the benefit of other travelers who plan ahead), use Squaremouth, a travel insurance clearinghouse, to select a reputable travel insurance company. It is a ""free"" service, and they only represent companies in good standing. We have used Squaremouth half a dozen times and only needed it once, last February, when I fell from a bike in Phayao, Thailand and broke my tibia. I was reimbursed 100% (though it took a lot of paperwork and I would probably pick a different company through Squaremouth next time). My general practice is to use a good travel agent (it really pays when you need someone to arrange emergency travel home) and independently buy good insurance from a company with a good reputation. It's worth it.And don't leave your passport and credit cards in the car, home or abroad."
"OAT says they provide unbiased, unedited reviews. However, they will delete mixed and poor reviews that offer truly useful and comprehensive trip and tour experience details for future travelers. They are very sneaky and clever in this respect. Not a company I can respect and will not travel again with them for this reason. Very misleading as many other travelers have pointed out."
"Well, you do have sometimes people who post less than objective reports."
"We have traveled over 20 some trips with GC and OATS and have never had anything but a wonderful experience. We have always taken trip insurance and have never had need to use it. Granted, some of the air travel has been less than wonderful, but you always have the opportunity to upgrade or make your own reservations which are much more expensive.These are individual choices and shouldn't be then blamed on the Company for your mistakes. Why anyone would leave passports and wallet in a car the day before leaving on their trip, and then blame the Company is beyond me, it's called stupid."
"ellenmuenter, so you MUST be in OAT's ""Club"". I have traveled with OAT/GCT a number of times (not quite a dozen yet?), and thus far have been satisfied, no complaint. My recent Africa venture was just ""fantastic"". I don't know the circumstances where some people complained about certain things, so can't comment. Some are not good travelers, what can one say?"
"Yes, we're in their club and have been traveling with them for over 15 years. I was on my second Africa trip last year and it was fantastic, but it was a hard trip that wouldn't have been for everyone, but I'm ready to go back.I'm going to Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Red Sea in the spring and expect another wonderful trip. You are right, there are people out there that you just can't make happy. We've been on trips with a few of them and I have to give the guides credit for having to deal with them."
"Well, they must be falling down on the job as far as deleting negative reports as yours got through as well as others that you're referencing."

"One buys trip insurance primarily (in my opinion) for the extremely critical situations, like emergency medical evacuation. Of course, if one's own personal (regular) insurance covers that, there's be no need for insurance. For that peace of mind, just in case, the couple of hundred bucks may be is worth. Insurance is the kind of expenditure that's like ""Damned if I do, damned if I don't"" expense. Another note, getting insured via an outside concern if cheaper than thru OAT. Likely because OAT is not insuring you, they're just selling a 3rd party policy, which enabled them to earn a cut also.Again, I add my voice of OAT. I've traveled with them a number of times (am a ""Club"" member, if you know what that club is, well!). So far so good. I used to have a major gripe, that their communication system is less than decent. They recently sent us a letter, saying they're beefing up their phone system. So, perhaps you can communicate with them even better now."
"Past=OAT/Grand Circle lover Present=OAT/Grand Circle hater Future=any tour company EXCEPT OAT/Grand CircleDont' trust them! If you do their entire package including airfare and their insurance, you might get some restitution when they pull their ""we had to change the dates of the trip because there were problems with the hotels"". If you booked your own air, you are out a ton of money and they just don't care. I called and called and they refused to give me compensation other than $267 cancellation fees/nothing for the thousands in airfare or other ""they caused it"" problems. They refused to give me an email or phone number to upper management but after I wrote to Mr and Mrs Lewis a clerk called me wanting to know if there was anything I wanted to add to my letter but would not discuss the issue....not even a credit towards a future trip. They've gotten too big for their britches....stay away!"
"Sorry about your experience, John T. We've traveled with OAT a number of times, and I've had no complaint so far. May be it's our luck. Anyhow, we did do some research on our own. I found that if you buy insurance through them, airfare with your booking, you'd likely pay more. They probably figure that they do the legwork for you, so they're entitled to a cut.... Doing my own homework for insurance airfare I'd save a bundle. This last time, I was lazy, I let them do my Africa Safari air, and it cost me somewhat more $$.Anyhow, with respect to cancellation, I've been lucky. Couple of years ago, I had booked the Africa Safari, but because of eBola they actually let us cancel without penalty/fee. I thought that was OK."
I have been on two OAT trips and find them to be an excellent company. We have an African Safari trip planned with them for next year and I am now looking at Nepal for the following. The people complaining above were complaining about circumstances unrelated to OAT - the theft of passports left in a car(??? what were they thinking??).
"Your time may be coming to experience some grave problems with OAT, their management and especially the in-country tour guides."

"Also, check your credit card company for coverage. We put EVERYTHING on our United CC which carries its own cancellation/loss etc. insurance (this is an expensive card, but worth it) -- even covers prepaid hotel fees. Also, it may be much less expensive to book air through a discount company (and pay with a CC that insures!) than to use OAT. They even admitted it to me -- especially if you want to upgrade your class.That said, this year I did their trip to Morocco and loved it -- Going to Africa in Spring 2018 and hear rave reviews about it --"
I recommend that you never buy the insurance from the company you are traveling with. I use a website for InsureMyTrip which allows you to compare various travel insurance companies and get the coverage you want for the price you are willing to pay. I didn't follow my own advice on a trip that I had to cancel with OAT and TripMate took an extraordinary amount of time to give me a refund.
"Well, I learned that lesson!"
have you ever taken OAT's Sicily tour?
We took the Sicily tour last year and found it excellent. It exceeded all of our expectations.
"I feel for you with OAT. I had a few issues with them starting in 2014 and with each trip, matters intensified!"
Why are you going back if you were unsatisfied? Why are so many people taking so many repeating trips with the company?We went on a trip last year and it was wonderful!
"We have NOT taken any more trips with OAT; we feel that it would be foolish to do so. We started to distrust them after just 3 trips and we had a series of horrible experiences on a trip to Africa. There are too many other travel companies that people are totally satisfied with. This company is exercising too much control once they have your $'s and it is very worrisome to us particularly when you are traveling in a foreign land. We ended up having to call the State Department and also our independent travel company for protection. We are a retired couple in our 60's and learned that the guides are poorly trained, arrogant, careless, etc. Keep participating, you may discover learn!"
What was meant is: buy independent travel protection insurance from other than OAT for your greatest protection. You will have a very weak defense if OAT's insurance company is contacted if you have a problem. OAT and their insurance company will work together to weaken your defense. The second point was as follows: Live and Learn!!
"Thanks for your detailed information! We did but travel insurance, but not from OAT. After trading your recommendation, we decided to buy travel insurance from another company. Thanks!! e heard the same advice regarding ravel insurance from other friends. They told us the same. Thanks for your good advice."
"For Africa, I've done it with OAT twice, South Africa 5-6 years ago, then last year Kenya Tanzania. BOTH trips we were highly satisfied. No problema!!!!!!! Insurance, I learned a long while back, get it cheaper through one other than the travel provider, cheaper and perhaps better. And bet it was. I've gotten insurance each of the last few times through another company. The people I dealt with were very, very pleasant. The person I had most contact with was simply just down to earth. She didn't have to tell me about her health, but when she was absent, she emailed me, telling me what her medical issues was. I wouldn't think otherwise that this person was nice, nice, nice. I had very pleasant dealings with the other staff on her side also.They're in the ""service"" business, they'd better be nice to the customer. With OAT, I didn't find anything bad with them yet. One very positive recent experience. They sent me a souvenir. I ordered a T-shirt, but they somehow sent it 1 size smaller than my regular fit. As soon as I informed them, I got a replacement within the week, no question asked. You would say that's because it's another department. Well... I didn't get mistreated by other OAT departments also, to note. I'm just sorry for those who weren't as lucky as we were."
Does Overseas Adventure Travel have twin accommodations by default or do you have to request this in advance? I am traveling with a friend but not a spouse and so I do not want to share beds!
"Probably should call and ask them. Probably depends on which trip you are taking. Probably depends on the arrangements you made with them. Probably depends on the circumstances when you show up at the hotel, which may well be different that what the people in Boston told you before your left on the trip."
ANd one more thing - buy travel insurance but NOT from OAT
"We have traveled three times with OAT/GCT. Our first trip was Machu Picchu and the Galapagos, the second Japan and the third was The Undiscovered Adriatic (GCT not OAT). We had a glitch with the third trip but more on that in a minute. We had traveled with a couple of other companies but some people we met on another trip suggested trying OAT. So we did and had a great time in Peru and the Galapagos. It was such a successful trip we decided to go to Japan with them. The group sizes are small (13 in Peru/Galapagos and 13 also in Japan), our guides were well informed and accommodating. The pace was great. I have recommended them to many people. Then came 2017. In 2016 I had booked a trip for Greece and Turkey. I was very excited about it. Then came the problems in Turkey. I received a letter one day in the spring of 2017 saying the trip was cancelled (sort of) It was actually adjusted and renamed. If I still wanted to go I should call and I could get on the new cruise (which went in and out of Athens rather that Athens/Istanbul)). So I called - and was told it was fully booked. They compensated us monetarily but the money could only be used in 2017. So I found an OAT trip that looked good - had to be GCT. So for my ""pain and suffering"" I was given a reward with lots of restrictions. What they should have done was allow me to book early for 2018 and let me use the reward money. I was quite annoyed. I made several calls, wrote a letter (several weeks later someone called me to see if my problem had been resolved). So my message is that customer service is not as good as they would like you to believe. In the end, we wound up using our reward and did the Undiscovered Adriatic. It turned out to be a great trip (we did add Florence and extra days in Venice at the front end and a couple of extra days in Malta at the end), I would HIGHLY recommend it. There were actually two groups cruising on the Artemis so 43 total for sailing time but two smaller groups for tours. We were unable to get the Greece trip (again) but are booked on The Suez Crossing (OAT)and looking forward to our trip in November. Even with the inconvenience we experienced, I would still recommend GCT/OAT. Our other experiences have included Viking, Vantage (land tour in China), Kensington and Exploring Vacations. The Viking for me was so-so. The others were great trips but I tend to lean toward this company.Edited: 2 years ago "
Please wright more about the Japan trip. We inend to take it in April. We hope it will be good!! Do they accommodate people who have food limitations?
Your TL handles all the dietary requests.(trip leader)
"Had I read what's published here about OAT, I would not bother with OAT though we had decent experience with them previously. I have tried to get them to recognize the mistake they made in not getting my wife and I on Premium Economy on cross Atlantic journey both ways. OAT charged us but when we received flight itinerary, only on return flight and not forward flight.Calling their 800 number got nowhere but was told that the supervisor would review recording and get back to me in 3~5 days. The window of response was missed multiple times. They take the call nicely but cannot help and cannot tell where to escalate. Reading this series about OAT just want $ and give non-response means we are stuck. Cancelling the trip would mean going thru more of the same of non-response aggravation. Live and learn for sure. Very unpleasant even before the start of our tour not to mention being cheated and nowhere to escalate to have the issue resolved."
A question please as to which you referred to. Is it the AARP or the Grand Circle you won't use again?Sandy
"The one I wrote about taking the money on Economy Plus and not coming through for the outward journey is with OAT, not AARP nor Grand Circle. The fact that we were in the so called Edmond Hillary Club makes no difference as far as issue resolution is concerned. For that matter, I asked what does it mean to be in the Club as a priority customer. It meant, you call would not be on hold. Once the call gets through, it is the same courteous repetition of the same line ""This is what I can do for you. Is there anything else?"" They are calm; listen to the problem as many times as you care to pose in different ways (including asking to talk to supervisor); answer the same script - someone will get back to you, and this is what I can do for you ...I will put in a priority, document the call in their call log."
"TWo years ago I took six people with me on an African OAT trip. When you have that many, they offer a reward - I wanted it in $, not against future reservations. They had to be reminded over and over that they owed me money. And then, the sent me a 1099 for the $800 which was totally incorrect, and that cost me money to get my taxes correct. When i was making these reservations they constantly battered me to get more people on the trip - they wanted me to do their marketing.They do not act like a professional organization, seem to lack processes (quality) for customer interaction and they claim they do not recognize TripAdvisor."
"Sounds like your issue has not been resolved to your satifaction, has it? Since they don't pay attention to independent channels like TripAdvisor, others like me who did not check on TripAdvisor would risk going with OAT. Hopefully your Africa tour turned out satisfactory."
"No, our issues were never resolved, hard to resolve an issue of not going to the Okavango Delta when it was on the itinerary and living at a ""safari Camp"" in Botswana was not a safari camp - it would have made a nice fishing camp in Wisconsin but it's not a safari camp, it had fences to keep the wildlife and neighboring people out and di NOT have guides and jeeps.  Misled twice.KEEP in mind - OAT does not belong to any professional travel associations: the places where quality, new ideas and customer service standards are set for most industries and services."
"Sorry to hear of a double whammy. You are right, I could not find OAT associated with any professional travel association. So far, Consumer Affairs reviews showed that they are a two star out of a five star rating perhttps:/…overseas_adventure.htmlThanks for sharing. I should have done due diligence.I hope that others would not be fooled by their marketing brochure that are as attractive as others."
who leaves wallet and passport in a car I don't even leave my purse in the trunk of my car in the US. One must take some responsibility for their actions and preparations to travel. You need to do your homework when traveling.
"Travelersandy, please note the initial post about stolen passports was from 2013."
The fact that the initial post is nearly 5years old does not make travelersandy's comment any less true or important.
"""The fact that the initial post is nearly 5years old does not make travelersandy's comment any less true or important.""It does dilute the comment if they thought they were actually giving the OP some information or advice. OP hasn't been back to TA since the initial post and has doubtless recovered from the event and moved on."
"I bought the OATs Tripmate insurance and had to cancel because of cancer surgery.After seven months and many phone calls I have not received a penny of the $6,600 they owe me."
That is very sad to hear. But not surprising. OAT does a lot of stuff very well but my experience is that when confronted with a customer issue or a change is made they do not respond (care?).Keep in mind they do not belong to any professional travel associations and probably have not had an opportunity to incorporate a set of corporate ethics. They do have all of the legal stuff in place - so they do have attorneys developing policies that are not in the interest of their customers.We have been on two of theri trips: first one was very well done - second one was OK with a few terrible spots.
"This is mostly about NOT going on a trip. I called to find out when dates for 2019 Israel trips would be released and was told that my friend and I could put deposits down in advance of the date release to secure rtwo single spots. We did so immediately during that initial call. We were sent confirmation letters saying that we would receive emails telling us when we could call and finalize our trip. We were also told on the phone, that if would probably be in the next 48 hours. Our credit cards were charged. We both checked our email and texts frequently from that point onward. After business hours last night an OAT rep called my cell and left a message saying the dates had been released . I called the moment they opened this morning and were told they are full for singles during the first 27 days in May. We could go during Passover in April during the a packed Israeli vacation time. My friend was never contacted by phone or email. I never received the promised email. The person I spoke to this morning was polite but had no explanation for how this happened or what the possible purpose of having us reserve in advance as that did not secure us spots during the time frame we'd specified. It didn't even secure us notification the day they opened up.. I went on a trip to India with OAT a few years ago and was impressed by the leader and the intelligent itinerary. It was difficult being a solo traveler as the group was comprised of four friends, couples and a family of three adults traveling in single rooms. I resolved that if I went again with OAT, I'd go with a friend so I'd have companionship. I gave them two stars because the trip I went on had a lot of good things about it. I would give them 0 starts for administration. If you are considering a trip with them, it is good to know that by the time the catalogue actually comes out, many trips will be completely full."
Typical of my experiences with them and the reason why I have not used them and will not use them again. They are terrible.
"OAT has a Jekyll and Hyde personality. The several trips we have taken with them have been terrific, with wonderful knowledgable guides and mostly fine accommodations and restaurants, but when a problem developed they were the Masters of Denial which caused us to stop traveling with them. We lost a lot of money to their so-called travel insurance. Too bad. Ultimately, their loss."
"That hits the nail on the head. IF things go well, they’re wonderful, but have an oops, and they walk away.....including stranding you for flight cancellations and not honoring insurance until lawyers are involved."
"gunner, I AM a lawyer but they still did not honor their own travel insurance when their own issues with our air routing somehow required cancellation due to several stops with unreasonably lengthy layovers en route to Japan."
"Wow, I guess I was lucky. Resolution occurred after I referred everything to the South Carolina insurance commission. They are a really terrible company but have some real devoted customers. I guess those are the ones who have never had a bump in the road because everybody else is on their own."
"Well, ignorance is bliss, and until you have that bump in the road, you have no reason to think there will be any problems. We took 5 trips with OAT in about 5 years and probably would have continued but for this issue with their insurance. I had trouble believing that they would rather cut good customers like us loose rather than work with us to resolve the issue."
"Hi Jim. I took 4 Oat trips and the last was the worst. In my opinion, many of their tour guides are undertrained, underpaid and arrogant. We had a horribly scary trip in Morocco and ended up returning to home after 5 days of a 22 day trip. We were afraid for our safety and OAT did noting to reassure us. The fear was with a Moroccan guide and his actions. Oat refunded every penny for the trip including the air. It was unbelievable that they kept the guide and used him for future trips Morocco. We were stunned too say the least that the guide is still with OAT. What travel company have you had better luck with?"
"We have not used any travel company for the past several years preferring instead to travel independently and hire private guides, which is much more expensive than traveling with OAT, but we travel at our own pace and have complete control over our itinerary and how much time we spend at each place we visit. While we were for the most part satisfied with the OAT trips and guides, traveling on our own has beeneven more rewarding."
"Just in case anyone is not aware, OAT and Grand Circle shares the same flight organization. If you are not happy with OAT's flight arrangement, you may want to keep that in mind if going on Grand Circle. Be prepared for dissatisfaction. In my case, I requested Premium Economy both ways across ocean at the outset. I discovered deceitful practice (taking my money for Economy Plus both ways and confirming only one way) with no remedy (neither return the money or reimburse after I was told to do the absent one on my own) when I received the itenery later. If I live in Cambridge, I would have taken them to small claims court."
"Hello! Yes, we did the Sicily tour in Oct 2016. Loved it. Had a wonderful guide (Alessio). You cover alot of ground in two weeks and see/learn alot. Keep in mind, there is almost downtime on this itinerary."
"Overseas Adventure Travel (OAT) DOES NOT GIVE A SINGLE PERSON THE SAME RATE AS A COUPLE. OAT STATES THAT YOU RECEIVE A FREE SINGLE SUPPLEMENT at the same price as a double rate. BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE. THIS IS WHAT THEY DO - They give promotions rates of $1000 - $2000 off the price to each person who book double occupancy. If you are traveling solo, you end up paying $1000 - $2000 per person more than each person sharing a room. They will not give the same discount to a person traveling solo."
I think that's not true. But there are limited act.s of the no single supplement fee.
"Unfortunately it is true. I’ve spoken with 3 different people at OAT concerning this issue. They told me that it states it on their brochures. The last brochure states “save 1000-$2400 per couple. “Offer applies to new reservations and cannot be combined with free or low-cost Single Supplement”. I get brochures from OAT almost weekly. Another brochure states, “Save $2000 per person”. On the other side of the brochure it states, “Keep in mind that these savings are for those not taking advantage of our free single supplement benefits” . OAT continuely offers $1000-$2000 to only people sharing a room, therefore, in reality the people traveling solo are actually paying $1000-$2000 more than the couples. There is nothing free about these single supplements."

"OAT truly dropped the ball. Just returned from the OAT Morocco Trip. Terrible customer service from the main office after the tour was booked. The experience in country was very good - excellent tour guide and a busy and interesting itinerary. Getting there was a disaster - An Air France strike cancelled our flight (booked by OAT) from Paris to Casablanca. Essentially, OAT told me this was my problem and offered no assistance in finding alternatives. I was on the phone for 7 hours (mostly on hold) with OAT, Air France, Delta, etc. I spoke to a supervisor at OAT who did nothing to assist and then asked to speak with someone in management. 2 WEEKS LATER, I received a call from ""Angela"".This was my second (and final) trip with OAT. If they can not provide better support when a problem occurs, they should not be in business.BTW, before donating to the ""Golden Circle Foundation"", you should request and review that foundation's IRS Form 990PF (their IRS filing, which must be provided upon request). In 2015, the Foundation's 5 top paid staff earned about $1.1M in salaries - almost as much as the total ""donations"" to all of their foundation recipients around the world! It is not rated on Charity Navigator because it's a private foundation, but if it was, I would think it would make interesting reading!"
I truly believe that the OAT Moroccan in-country office needs a total review of the staff and their procedures. Enough is enough and my husband and I will not ever travel with OAT again because of a terrible set of circumstances while in Morocco. OAT's home office is not better at assisting with problems.
@Elaine- a few more specifics would make your post more valuable and informative.
Similar issues with them. There are as good insurance options for less money and often it is a significant savings and convenience to book your own air. My big issue with them is the inability to reach OAT Travel on the phone for problems.
"I will never book airfare through them on any future trip. Group flights are supposed to be more convenient, with OAT they are a headache."
"Cancel for any reason trip insurance does not mean getting your money back, it means rebooking another trip. A number of outfitters will do that anyway."
We are following the OAT Morocco Tour posts b/c we may/may not schedule in future - Thanks for the posts.
"This comment is relative to OAT's travel insurance carrier TrpMate. We had a trip all booked/paid and ready to go to a Israel. Then, 48 hrs before departure we saw on the news that rockets were being launched from southern Syria into Israel. We contacted OAT and they said the trip was still on. We felt uncomfortable not knowing if this situation could be escalated so we canceled ""for any reason"". We cancelled, gave appropriate notice to OAT and TripMate and filed all the necessary paperwork. All we are looking for is return of the allowable refundable portion of the tour which is worth about $7,000. It's been almost 2 months and no closure. I have called 3 times now and get the same story that ""these are unprecedented times and we are extremely busy"". TripMate knows they have my claim but can not offer any status other that ""it's being reviewed"". Do not under any circumstances use OAT's TripMate travel protection company. Read the reviews and you will see why!!Edited: 2 years ago "
"I had several great OAT trips - wonderful because the local guides were so good, another with a former school teacher who treated us like children, and another that was a complete disaster. The disaster was Peru and Bolivia which had a horrible itinerary because it was ever ascending, farther and farther away from medical care. I got altitude sickness and was dumped at a local medical clinic 100 miles from the airport and my last chance to escape, where to this day I don’t think I saw a doctor. Had insurance, but the clinic, which took all my cash, never did respond to my insurance company to certify it was medically necessary to terminate the trip, while conceding that when you have altitude sickness and a spike in blood pressure, the remedy is to go down, not up. So had a 100 mike ambulance trip and paid for someone associated with the local company to help me, then wheelchair bound, get home from the airport.Had to fight to get a full refund of a Bali trip OAT cancelled, where I had used some credits of theirs.  But had wonderful, wonderful guides in Croatia,Bolivia, Japan, China, Columbia, and MoroccoEdited: 2 years ago "
"Wonderful guide in Cambodia, too"
Instead of buying travel insurance for each trip separately why not look into buying one policy? Spouse and I have a policy with American Express but there are other providers too. Just be sure the policy provides the coverages you need/want.
"We had Noreddine Al Mazdi (Nory) as a nightmare of a guide in Morocco. He was the absolute worst guide with any travel company that we have ever used for a host of reasons. This turned out so badly that we had our insurance provider, my husband's HR from an international company and a contact with the U.S. Department of State on the phone through the middle of the night on our trip. We actually feared for our general safety; feared for our lives! We were lucky to get a refund from OAT which had nothing to do with our independent trip insurance. The guide lives in Holland and returns to Morocco on occasion to lead trips. We felt that he returned to just visit with family and friends and then tell us what we could go do on our own for the day or evening. He did not speak the truth and did not wish to answer questions during our travels but rather only speak to the van driver. On another OAT trip, my husband traveled to Route of The Maya alone because I fractured my ankle 2 wks before departure. I had independent insurance and received the entire trip amount after about 30 days. As a side note, the guide promised them 100's of photos of the trip upon their return so everyone gave him nice tips. They returned to write him a number of times for what was promised and no one received anything. Another bad guide!"
Yes we also had a wonderful female guide in Cambodia; one of the best ever!!
Please refer to recent Trip Advisor reply.
"Put a ""refundable"" deposit down on a trip in March 2018 to Israel, Egypt and Jordan for December 2019. A couple of my friends told me that they had been in Israel in December and had experience rain / snow. Decided to cancel the trip but found that cancelling the trip had a penalty associated with it. Never had any documentation in the emails OAT sent to me. They said it is in the terms and conditions and that because I had made a pending reservation ""live"" it was no longer refundable.Buyer beware!! Doubt if I will ever travel with them again and I am a past customer."
Thank you. I have traveled with OAT 8 times. All fantastic. As I also am not a rich retiree I always buy insurance.
Cancel for any reason is expensive with all insurance companies. That's why OAT is expensive. Shop around for the best price for your needs.
"I have traveled 3 times with OAT, Sicily, Morocco and India and booked 3 more trips for the future: The Ancient Kingdoms, Japan and Israel.Their Trips are spectacular, the trip leaders are educated and knowledgeable and they have so many destinations to choose from. Don't blame OAT for your theft, I always buy the insurance for that same reason, sometimes trying to save, costs you more at the end. Travel with OAT, you will not regret it!. Best value and no single supplement charge."
"Can you imagine how difficult it would be for a tour company to organize and properly books trips if people could cancel whenever without any kind of penalty. There are people out there who would book one tour just to be sure they had something guaranteed and then just cancel it if something else appealed to them. In the meantime, the tour company would have quit promoting that particular trip thinking they had a full house. There would be a scramble to fill the trip and probably some discount given which would drive up the costs which would be passed on to US! I don't care to pay extra for people who think they can change their minds whenever they want . I've paid the penalty (usually $250 to $350) and grumbled to myself for not thinking it through, but I've never blamed the tour company. Take some responsibility for pete sake."
"Insurance is a great idea when you travel - especially if your a senior, an age group with a higher incident of changes because of health, accidents, death, family issues etc.But DON""T buy the insurance from OAT or any operator, it is one of their highest margin products, just like the rental car companies.There are good insurance products available in the market, AAA for instance, as well as many credit cards that include insurance, typically you'll get better coverage for a lower price, especially if it's with the credit card.People who think they are sophisticated travelers, and only ride one bus, miss out on a lot of stuff."
"I am a woman with no chronic health issues and had a similar experience. A week before the I trip became very ill. I purchased my own airfare and hoped to join the tour a bit late. Was hospitalized and missed the entire trip. I didn't expect, or ask, for a refund but asked if my OATS tour cost could be used the following year for another tour. I was told ""no you didn't buy insurance"". I do HOLD OATS RESPONSIBLE. A similar event happened to a friend with another company. The tour cost was able to be applied to a future trip. No lost revenue to the tour company and a satisfied customer. I will now always travel with this company if possible. I probably wouldn't travel with OATS again whether I purchase trip insurance or not. Excellent guides are important but so is customer service."
"Carolyn, how can you blame a company? Yes, it is unfortunate you had to cancel - but are they supposed to just give up the lost income. They still have costs. Should those merely be absorbed ... and what if everyone cancelled. That is why there is insurance offered. Now, we don't buy insurance but I do understand that if I have to cancel, I'll lose the money.The only way another company can offer an unlimited cancellation policy is to pass the costs onto other travelers. But if that's what you want - understand there is no free lunch as they say."
"I totally agree with you Jesse.I feel bad for people who have paid for a trip they can't take but honestly, where is their sense of personal responsibility? You need to take precautions if you can't afford to loose the money. That is why we have auto, homeowners, medical insurance. If you house burned down and you didn't have insurance would you expect your mortgage company to pick up the loss? and if they did who do you think would be paying more to make up for that. OAT trips are very reasonably priced in comparison to other small group companies. I have gone with a few of the others and paid quite a bit more,especially since i go as a single, but sometimes i just want to go on a trip OAT doesn't offer. If OAT can continue to charge less because they aren't subsidizing for cancellations that's fine with me. I'm content to buy insurance (Not through OAT tho) and hope that i never need it."
"Rick Steves', which is similar in cost and size of tour participants.... so no difference there.Rick Steves doesn't refund your money - they keep it. But they do allow you to apply it to a future trip. That actually makes money for the tour company. I would choose that company to use my credit bringing additional people........ thus more money for the company. You can't ""cancel for any reason"" There a limited number of reasons to cancel - hospitalization is one. Although crazy for leaving it in the car, I would assume having my car broken into and a stolen passport is another. I could afford to ""lose the money"". I was just shocked when they wouldn't apply the cost toward another tour as happened in the past, to a friend of mine, with a Rick Steves tour. OATS is great for not charging single supplement! It's suppose to attract single travelers. I've seen friends/family traveling together and each booked single supplement. I was told they are going to do away with that as it's abused.There are lots of tour companies out there and customer service is what makes for repeat business. Because of that OATS will never be a first, or even second choice for me."
"@Carolyn- did you not have travel insurance with a company other than OAT? If not then you are entirely to blame. Travelling with insurance is a risky thing to do,"
"I often travel out of the country on my own but when I book a tour I generally don't get trip insurance. I always purchase medical insurance.I often travel with Rick Steves' and know the tour cost can be transferred to a future date if a genuine emergency occurs. My thought is if something happens and I can't go I have a bigger problem than the money lost! However, you have a point and I might consider it in the future. I received something from my credit card company advising me that they provide trip insurance if the card is used for purchase. I'm going to get the details!"
"This just happened to me. OAT changed the itinerary on my Ultimate Australia trip, for which I had paid in full, and charged me an extra $300.00 for changes I did not like. this will be my last OAT trip."
"I agree with all of the other complaints....I have gone with them five times and been very satisfied but they have gotten too big and too greedy and can care less about customer complaints.1) My friend and I booked the Colombia trip with the Bolivia extension with two single rooms for 2019 before the dates were published. We put down our deposits and said to call after the trip dates were posted. We did and they had already booked all the single supplements after we reserved and paid! They advertise free singles and then only offer a few. It didn't used to be that way. Now they said we could get single rooms if we paid for the supplement....false advertising! Needless to say we are never traveling with them again.2) Prior to the Colombia trip, another friend and I booked the trip in Feb,2019 to Iceland. We got singles and they booked my airfare for me on Delta. My friend booked her own air on Delta and we would fly together from NYC to Iceland. Just recently they called me and said they wanted to change me to Icelandic Air which gives me a full day layover at JFK and would mean I wouldn't be traveling with my friend. I refused and they wanted me to pay the $200. transfer fee from the hotel to the airport. Of course I complained...it says in print in the trip information that they will pay transfers morning or night. They would not back down, plus they never even told my friend...just a $200. surprise when she is ready to leave. Then it turns out we can share a $25. taxi to the airport so everybody is getting ripped off with a $200. transfer fee, even if it is a private shuttle! This company has completely changed their way of doing business and I regret that I had already paid for the trip to Iceland and one in November for Patagonia, but it's too late now. As a member of the Sir Edmund Hillary Club (what a joke! They didn't even offer a gift this year) they obviously don't care about losing travelers. My one friend was also a member and my other friend a first time traveler with OAT. Of course they won't go again either. I recommend no one else go either."
"We will NEVER travel again with OAT! Several friends who had traveed many times before, told us they would never do it again. The company became very smug and sure it can do anything they want. Our last trip was just a money maker for the company. The guide was hardly speaking English. Poor itinerary. Lots of free time. Many important, very interesting sights were not included. We wrote a detailed report, but nobody ever contacted us to talk more... What a waste of time and money! e are, at least, warning all of the people we know not to travel with this company. We are glad we already ""saved"" several friends from falling into this trip. Mybe when less people take their trips, they will start caling people and finding out what people need."
Your trips are only meant to squeeze money out of innocent travelers. The trips are planned in a way to force everyone to take the optional yours. The minimum requirement should be a guide who knows English... I wrote a long evaluation but you did not even bother to read it.
I am sorry to hear that you had a bad experience. Me and my wife are going to India to meet with a representative of Bengal IT Services for a software development project. We used OAT before and they never disappointed us. You should have bought the insurance. We never travel without insurance. It's worth it.
"Hi JackRWethington, can you give me the website of the Indian corporation? Do they design websites? I need a website designed for my house cleaning business."
"Hello JuneJStevens, My profile is new. It might be against forum rules to post links. I will send a message to you. Have a nice day!"
@JuneJStevens Yes. They design websites.Edited: 2 years ago 
"I fully agree! Their reputation is no what it used to be. Several friends who went on many trips with OAT, NOW WARNED US not TO GO BECAUSE THEY HAD CHANGED AND AL THY WANT IS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY..."
"I am in the process of booking our third OAT trip - and know this may be a dumb thing to do, but their Australia/new Zealand trip is exactly what we want.Three suggestions:1. never buy insurance from OAT2 never buy airfare through them3. read their agreement before you pay money - it is a bad agreement and says that their ""trip leaders and program directors"" are third party contractors and that OAT does not ""supervise or control"" them.ANd yes, their service is terrible.Their business number is: 617 350 7500 - wait for an operator and tell them you want to speak to an executive: Denise Sablone is the President, start there.We have traveled with National Geographic, Tauck, Oceania Cruise Lines, Viking and others - and they all have bad days - but none as many as OAT."
"BEWARE OAT AIR SERVICE:   My husband and I have traveled with OAT 11 times.  We love their tours- especially the small size and the superb guides.   Their air service, however, is mediocre at best.  We have just had a most unpleasant experience with them on our travel home from Australia.   This trip, I think, is the first time we have used their service and I would hesitate before ever using their air service again.  Below I highlight just two of our problems as a warning about OAT air service.  Our poor opinion of OAT air service started  months ago.  I didn’t keep the details because I did not anticipate future problems. For some reason I called OAT air services and found out that the time had changed between our arrival in The United States and making a very tight departure home. The OAT person told me that if I wanted to keep abreast of these changes I needed to be in contact with the airline directly.   Our most serious complaint occurred when we were in Australia.  A little over a week before our return flight, we received an email from our superb Australian guide saying there were issues with our flight. The message she sent on to us said the only flight available for us to get home on our booked date was an ECONOMY flight back that night even though we had booked  BUSINESS class tickets. The Bangkok office which handled bookings was closed for the weekend and an extra day for a national holiday. Our guide then decided not to wait three days for making a change but worked with the home office in Australia and then a special contact in New York to rebook us on another BUSINESS flight home with a stop in Melbourne on the day we originally requested.   When I got home I wrote and talked to OAT.   I learned  most  disturbing information. SEATS MAY BE AVAILABLE ON THE FLIGHT YOU WANT BUT OAT DOES NOT HAVE ACCES TO THESE SEATS . The carrier determines what access OAT has depending on OAT’s arrangement with the carrier. This also means that you can not get on the phone and deal directly with the airline; you must go thru OAT.  There is more to this story;  bottom line -  Beware of unpleasant consequences if you book air travel with OAT."
"Thanks for your important post! We would WARN everybody to carefully check ANY tour by OAT. Apperently, they do not care about pleasing their customers, and have become greedy, interested ONLY in making money. We were quite surprised, very disappointed and, frankly, hurt, when we never got a followup all after we wrote report that was not all positive. They should have paid more attention to the points we mentioned, since after our first trip we gave the highest grades to everything. Several friends of ours had the same experience. We will not travel with them again. Our friends were going to take 2 trips (each family including several people! ) and they chose another highly recommended travel company. Beware!!! Do NOT count on the past positive experiences. This comppany was good. Now they want only your money!"
"Read the ""agreement"" you have with the parent company Grand Circle, LLC - it's not with OAT.""To the extent we book air for you, we act as an agent of the air carrier and NOT as your agent.""OAT/Grand Circle is not acting on your, the customer's behalf, they are working for the air carrier.WHY would anyone book their air through an agency that does not represent them?They book air because they make more money than when you book your own.People are enamored with OAT because it is CHEAP travel - and cheap instead of quality is what we get."
"TI agree with everything you said. Then why are you going with them?  I Just talked to friends who took their trip to Australia and swore NEVER to go with them again. Why buy trip insurance from them? NEVER buy trip insurance or flights from the company you go with.I have no time or patience t explain why. It is one of the basic facts that every traveller should know. If OAT would see a BIG DROP in the number of people going, maybe they would start reading the evaluations.. (I am sure ours was not read...)."
"I have traveled with OAT and Grand Circle Travel over ten times in the past twenty years and have felt they were a great company for senior single travelers and couples. However, in the past year my views have changed greatly and I am sorry to say I will not be traveling with them again. I am the friend of Amy M. wrote on this topic earlier. We put down a deposit of $500 a piece for a 2019 Columbia/Bolivia reservation and we were assured of the trip when the new dates came out. I called immediately when the dates became available and was told our reservations were given to someone else and there were no singles available unless we wanted to pay a supplement. That was not what we agreed to when we made our reservations and put down the deposits on a conference call. My money was refunded but of course OAT had the advantage of gaining interest on ours and others' deposits. Additionally, when I have contacted them by phone, their representatives have become high pressure sales personnel. One was very insulting when I refused to take their air package. I could site additional examples of their greed and lack of customer service-expensive insurance, patronizing attitude, bait and switch tactics. When traveling in the future, Roads Scholar will be my go to company."
"Thanks for the update...  I am looking at late 2019 but do not know of another small group company that has a good reputation and does not penalize a solo traveler... I was surprised that business class paid clients did not know their seats on the plane. I used business class with non USA airline and I could login to that airline and see my seat, actually talk to an airline agent on the phone, not so for premium economy or economy.. Yes, I always purchase my insurance through square mouth, with coverage for company bankruptcy.Just hope I survive the altitude in Tibet."
"I can see how some of these reviews would scare of customers, but i have to say one more time that i have not had any problems like those mentioned. I have been on 10 or 11 trips. The majority of the guides have been excellent. We only had one that i complained about and tht was mainy because he stuck to the intinerary rather than taking opportunities for a little""adventure"". I didn't call and complain but i did mention on my review that he made the trip a bit boaring and was not as adventuresome as other guides had been. OAT called me, apologized, and gave me $200 credit towads my next trip.Regarding issues with OAT organized airfare, i usually book my own and get a taxi to my hotel. I am going with OAT to Antartica in January. I let them book my airfare because theirs was less expensive than what i could find. The info they sent me had my reservation code with Delta so i went online on the Delta site and doublechecked the flights and my seat assignments. I changed one seat and had no trouble doing so. I'm traveling coach, not an upgrade. Also, i am going a day early so i don't get the included transportation that you get when you arrive on the assigned day. I don't remember if the agent told me that but it was right there in the info they sent me so no suprises.My only point about this is that things have worked fine for me. My guess is tht as they get bigger and do more trips with more people statistically there will be more unsatisfied people. Im not sure there is any tour company that can asure 100% satisfaction. Anyway, i have gone with 3 other small group companies and i really don;t have a favorite. It all depends where i want to go and what i want the focus of my trip to be. So, don't give up on OAT If you have been satisfied so far. Oh, yes, and also never buy their insurance unless money is no option. Thats what Squaremouth and Insure my Trip is for."
"#278 if you want visit China, look at Gate 1 small group tours.You have to pay single supplements with them, but price will be better that OAT anyway.I travel with OAT and GCT , they not that bad, but I like GATE 1 more, Central America tour with OAT was very good."
"Just completed my 10th trip with OAT. I starting traveling overseas at 27 and found OAT at 55. Now 73 and am giving OAT an A for their guides are so knowledgable, professional, caring, etc of all the tour groups that I have traveled. Again no more than 16 participants. Their air intinery was excellent. I always double check on my own and they always find the best connections, fares, etc with the shortest layover times. Obviously highly recommend. The Best.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Wow, what a variety of experiences shared on this site regarding OAT! We just returned from our second trip with them; it was the Ultimate South Africa tour to Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana. The first trip we took with them was to New Zealand, and we had such a great time we decided to do the Africa itinerary and asked 8 friends of ours to join us; I would have to say we were all happy with our decision. My husband and I had traveled quite often with a hiking group prior to OAT; it was a higher end travel group, so, at first we had some trepidation about our decision. Happy to say, New Zealand was great, and we loved all the stops we made along the way. There are a few issues with OAT that we might mention...….seems as if a lot of the complaints are about the air travel OAT offers and their travel insurance.....those are an easy fix. DON'T book those items through them; make your own air reservations and buy your own travel insurance from another company, then you can't be angry or disappointed in the outcome and blame OAT. We've done that and it's been a good decision all around. I might add we have found that no group trip is going to be perfect, but if you like the itinerary and the cost, you can always tweak the itinerary by NOT doing the optional tours and going off on your own for what I call a ""time out"" from the group. It's worked beautifully for us to do just that. As for the Africa trip we just took, we think OAT did a very good job at a price that was much less than our other two African safaris we planned on our own; the value is there for sure. Our guide was excellent, the camps were quite nice, the wildlife was wonderful and we were very satisfied. BTW, calling them has become easier over the past two years, but, I have to agree it's annoying to be put on hold for an hour.....I guess if that's the worst thing about traveling with OAT, it's okay."
"BK & CB - Glad your African adventure went so well. We have done Ultimate Africa twice - first time was fantastic, second time, we took two grandchildren, was not.At the last minute the school visit in Zimbabwe was removed - because the road was too bumpy. This was to be one of their highlights of the trip - meeting school children in Zimbabwe. And, every road in Zimbabwe is bumpy. Reality was a couple in their 80s, with 13 OAT triops insisted on a day off. We had a bad trip leader.At the last minute, our flight from Hwange to Vic Falls was changed to a seven hour miserable drive. reason given was that Wilderness Safari had all of their aircraft in for maintenance. Three days later I talked to Wilderness and was assured that OAT had canceled the flight to save money. The long drive had no food or bathrooms: the fuel station they stopped at had been closed for along time - no services or food or drinks.At Chobe we stayed at a small motel outside of Kasne. This was for Chobe. Tis motel did not have guides or jeeps. They borrowed them from another camp - and we missed one entire wildlife viewing trip.AND - we never went to Okavango Delta - the camp was in Moremi Game Reserve and according to our pilot that flew us in and out, we were 20 miles from the delta, although our guide insisted we were in the delta - so where was the water?Our trip from Kasane to Zambia was in 3 small metal outboards across the very busy Zambezi River with no life jackets. When I told OAT in Boston about this they said I was mistaken.OAT delivers some good trips - and looking at this web site - they also deliver low cost high risk trips.And I strongly disagree with one of your points: A paying customer deserves much better than an hour wait on the phone - 15 minutes is too long.We are doing a Viking cruise and immediately after our first conversation with Viking we got the direct phone and email for our customer service rep. OAT doesn't give phone numbers or emails to customers - they give long waits.You are absolutely correct - NEVER buy air or insurance from OAT. Their agreement states they are the agent for the airline not for you or me."
"I have traveled 14 times with either Grand Circle Travel or OAT, taken out their insurance each time. I've had to use it twice and had no trouble getting a refund either time. It has taken several weeks, but that is to be expected. Maybe, you didn't read what it covers. Either group is very helpful. All of my trips have been out of the country."
"Thanks Irma. Its good to see a straight forward comment about OAT/Grand Circle. I've already responded to this forum too many times so i'm not going to get into another big discussion. It doesn't really help convince people who are already angry. I don't take OAT insurance because it costs more that other insurances and it basically the same coverage. However, i have no doubt that if i did take their insurance and needed it i would be treated fairly. Now that i say that word, i think ""fairly"" is what a traveler needs to be expecting. If you are expecting to be treated like you are special, no matter what the ads say, at some point you are going to be really disappointed and angry. I've traveled with them 12 or maybe 13 times. No problems."
Only a dummy leaves all their stuff in a car
Has anyone found a travel insurance provider that they would recommend or rate as “Excellent?”
insuremytrip.com
Also Squaremouth. But neither of them are actual insurers. They are more like a broker that stands behind the insurers it represents.
"I have booked seven trips with OAT. With two travelers per trip, that is 14 passages. My upcoming trip will be my last because OAT changed the itinerary, after I had paid in full, and charged me an extra $300.00 per tour for changes I did not request and do not want. The revised trip does change a long bus ride into a flight, but it also eliminates one flight and one city from my tour. I also notice a very large increase in the ""free time"" provided as opposed to guided visits to historic or scenic destinations. I spent far too many hours trying to get satisfaction from OAT. This is not a good way to treat loyal travelers."
"i'm curious. I've had a few more trips with OAT than you have had, but i have not had any of the problems that people are mentioning. 2 questions: 1)on which trip did they change the routing, and 2) have you told OAT either through a survey or on the phone tht you are no longer going with them and why? Maybe they are growing too fast and maybe they need to hear from frequent travelers who are going to give them very bad reviews.thanks"
"I am going on the Ultimate Australia trip with the New Zealand extension. I spent many many hours on the phone with OAT, I completed three separate surveys,I and wrote letters of protest. My travel partner also attempted to gain some satisfaction with OAT, but they never even provided the followup call they promised. Had I booked my travel arrangements and my insurance with OAT, I could have cancelled the entire trip, but because I made other choices, I would have lost several thousand dollars had I taken that option. OAT has every right to increase its price and to provide additional ""free time"" on this trip. Had I known the new itinerary and price, I would have been in a position to plan accordingly. My grievance stems from the fact that I bought one thing and am being charged for another, and in my opinion, a less satisfactory product. Normally, I am a happy traveller who rarely complains, but this is a matter of principle. OAT should have honored the original price for travelers who had paid in full before the changes were announced."
"I agree with you. A number of the OAT complaints i've read come from people with unreasonable expectations. Your expectations are very very reasonable. If that happened to me i'd be furious. I thought it might be the Australia trip that you were referencing. I was on it a few years ago and complained in my survey that we spent entirely too much time on the bus, that some of the places they had us visit seemed more like ""fillers"" rather than someplace i'd actually like to go. Plus, the guide, a very nice man, but very by the book, never went off schedule for an impromptu experience. It is those out of the blue experiences that i really like about OAT. Anyway, i complained and received a $200 credit towards another OAT trip, which i used. They also told me that they were going to enrich the trip because of complaints like mine. Looks like you got the enrichment and they got enriched. That's very bad PR. I'm going to Antartica in January, which costs a fortune. Not sure what i'd do if they increased the price on me. Thanks"
I was recently told by one of those people on the phone at OAT - that the only way the trip cost would increase is if the total cost of the trip had not been made.They said that paying for the total trip protected customers from any increases.None of this surprises me - I often get different answers to the same question from different people on their phone - the mystery people who do not have email or a phone extension number. I find this all interesting with all of the technology available in the 21st century.
"I've used World Nomads Travel Insurance several times. Luckily I've never had to file a claim, but they receive good reviews and their prices are very reasonable."
You validate my abandoning OAT. They’re terrible.
"Your review was very surprising, to say the least. We had the same guide on our OAT trip to Morocco in September, 2017. He was fabulous. Very professional and a wealth of information on all aspects of Morocco. OAT does allow ""free time"" to be on your own and suggestions are made as to things to do on your own."
Morocco guide wonderful. Oat corporate made all the mistakes on that trip and left us hanging. The MONGOLIA guide was the worst imaginable. Different trip. Sorry.
"I recently returned from the OAT Ultimate Africa tour. This trip was very comprehensive and we stayed in four very remote, rustic facilities where our group of 15 were the only travelers. Unfortunately, my friend and I both experienced some minor medical issues. That is when we found out the no one in the OAT community has been trained in basic first aid and there was no first aid equipment/supplies on any of the premises. They didn't even have a band-aid. I have taken trips to many national parks, even in other third-world countries. I have stayed in other rustic environments without problems. But I would not travel with OAT again because of this recent experience."
"Exactly what I’d expect. If you’re lucky, you might be satisfied with OAT but if anything in any area goes wrong, expect nothing. We had very good friends who always traveled with them, so we went along. Had it just been us, we’d never have subjected ourselves 2 more times after the first trips mishaps."
"@gunnerhilton. To subject yourself two more times is ridiculous even when friends are involved. Learn to speak up for yourself, not one else will."
"Practically speaking you are absolutely right, but the issue was very complex."
"I haven't even gone on my trip and if I could cancel I would.I have travelled with many other tour companies. What sold me about OAT was their itinerary for Vietnam. Don't get fooled by great itineraries. 1. Months after booking, I received a letter informing me that there were changes made to the itinerary. They removed a lot of the museums and excursions that were included in the price, without replacing any of these or reducing the price.2. I booked my airfare with their travel department since I wanted to do a layover in Hong Kong. I paid for business class and all segments were booked in business. Then I get a phone call from the travel department (in October - the trip leaves 11/27/18) informing me that they made a mistake on the Hong Kong-Hanoi portion and had to change the flight to get me there earlier and with the other travelers. The travel agent neglected to inform me that I was now flying coach for this segment.Called the company numerous times and was told that nothing could be done. I emailed corporate three times and have yet to hear back from them.Their customer services is horrible. I am a seasoned traveller and have taken lots of tours with other companies and have never had this type of issue. Most companies are professional and if there is an issue, they return emails/calls and try to resolve it. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
They have perfected lying at a reasonable price. People who are lucky will rate them favorably whereas those who fall victim to their perfidy will post the truth.
I have heard that oat insurance is more. Who have you used that you got such a great saving.
I have used Travelex insurance for my last few trips. Have only had to use it once when my husband had to cancel his tickets for the trip. I had no problems with them to get the refund.
"Had booked a trip through GCT for Holland 2019 (same company as OAT) with trip paid in full around time booked 7/18. They cancelled the trip last month with email notification stating had to change the itinerary days as bought a new ship impacting the departures and advised all affected to call to rebook. As unable to rebook for desired dates (problem compounded by long phone wait times to get through), asked for full refund. One month+ later with different reasons for delay given, still waiting - and still long average phone wait times up to 45 - 50 mins. Consider handled poorly and would not advise booking with this company."
"For clarification, my reply, #297, was made in response to post #248. It was in regard to the guide they had in Morocco. My sister and had the same guide, Norredine AlMazdi, in September, 2017. He was absolutely excellent, professional, knowledgeable and concerned with all the members (14) of our group."
"I have been telling many of you OAT travelers about how terrible they were since 2016!! My husband and I must have been on the cutting edge of the horrible treatment by OAT. I tried warning everyone on this website to only be met with objection and defense of OAT. I am pleased to see that a few supporters are now believers. I have learned not to buy their insurance. OAT's air connections are terrible. If you have any problems with guides, OAT washes their hands of any and all issues. Their use of all third party guides has led to big issues for us and others. We had an Israel guide that lost her position after our trip. I could write what happened but it would sound totally unbelievable. We went to Thailand and suffered throughout the trip with a very immature married mane guide that was a drinker and interested in dumpling the group and hanging out with two younger gals in the evening. The gals were on the trip with older travelers. Then there was the horrible Moroccan guide from The Netherlands who entered Morocco under the guise as a guide. He cancelled most tours so that he could spend time with the friends and family where he grew up in Morocco. The group was on our own because he went in another direction instead of being a good tour guide. Happy trails to all of you who continue to travel with OAT. Your turn may come, sooner or later. You may not be happy when you finally experience what we are warning you about!!"
"All i can say is that i've done 15 trips with OAT, plus trips with other groups, and, of course travel without a tour, and have had no major problems. Guess when you travel with companies that handle an enormous amount of travelers there are bound to be issues, some legit, some not. So, it's your choice. I do know however that if i had more than one major issue i would not be traveling with them again. It appears that some travelers are gluttons for punishment."

"I have completed a third tour with Overseas and am still very pleased.  My next trip is to Australia & New Zealand and I will fly Business Class due to the long flight. I usually research the best routes and cost before OAT sets up airfare, so I can compare. OAT was able to get me a business class ticket at a very, very good price that I could not purchase directly from Qantas. I picked my seat with OAT and confirmed also with a login to Qantas. I know OAT can not control the airline, but I hope the A380 is as good as advertised by Qantas. If you are not happy with prior airfare, be sure you know the top 5 routes/schedules and their associated prices, then see which ones OAT will book for you. So far, for me, they have done a great job, but then I knew what flight schedules I liked. Hope this helps.."
"We were on the OATMorocco tour in October 2018 with Azziz. We had no difficulties; thought the guide was great. Lots of contact with locals. Once, out of the blue, we pulled over. Azziz hiked out and asked a nearby nomad if he would talk with us. We spent an unexpected 15 minutes learning about that life. Many of the restaurants we went to catered to tourist groups which meant more tagine then you might want. But the food was reasonably good.We took 4 days in northern Morocco on our own before joining the tour. Azziz called us there and asked if we needed any help getting to Rabat for the tour. Lucky he did because we had found that the buses we intended to use were all fully booked. Azziz arranged for a car, which we paid for, but appreciated."
"I have been through Thailand, Peru, Costa Rica, Tanzania, Scandinavia, and Ecuador/Galápagos with OAT. It would take a whole lot of convincing to get me to travel with any other company. Their guides are fabulous, they don’t waste your time (have cut down on factory visits from my experience), and you end up with lots of authentic experiences, are well fed and well cared for by competent guides with whom often you’d love to become lifetime friends. Take the insurance though! My friend and I both ended up hospitalized in Thailand immediately after a huge flood a few years ago. The hospital was amazing.....best I’ve ever encountered. My guide found us a great hotel room right in Bangkok, which was a true miracle, where we stayed two extra days at no expenses until we were “fit to fly home”. She even picked us up in her personal car to take us to the airport and usher us as close to security as she was allowed, complete with a boxed breakfast for us. Find me another company whose guides are that caring!"
All of your experiences were good and I'm pleased to hear of your luck with OAT. I hope that your satisfaction continues. I truly wished that my husband and I had had better experiences before we gave up on them.
"We always take the offered travel insurance. Yes, it is expensive but well worth it, in my opinion. I was traveling with a group of friends on the OAT New Zealand and Australia trip and one of our group became ill in New Zealand. I stayed in New Zealand with her while she was treated. Not only did she get full reimbursement for the 3 days we had to stay behind, we BOTH received full payment for the hotels, meals, taxis to/from the hospital and clinics AND for airfare to rejoin the group. Altogether it was about $4000.Our OAT guide and the insurance company rep were in constant contact with us the entire time and available 24/7 if we needed them. So sorry your experience wasn’t the same."
"We had an absolutely wonderful African safari with OAT. But, as other posts have noted, make sure that you have some type of travel insurance. Our daughter became very ill and had to have emergency surgery the first time we scheduled and we had to cancel. We had not purchased OAT's VERY expensive insurance, but I had checked and I did have insurance coverage through my credit card (not all cards have this so you need to ask). OAT would not do anything for us, not even reschedule our trip, but the credit card company refunded every penny. If your card has insurance, that's a very good reason to use the card and not a check.Ww booked the trip again, and it was a great trip. However, OAT effectively got paid for it twice!"
"Hi, I've posted before defending Oat for the majority of their trips. I just came back from Antarctica with OAT. There were 150 of us on a polar expedition ship. Most had traveled with OAT before and a fair amount had traveled with them mor than i have (15 trips). This trip was absolutely fabulous and very well done. In fact, our ship was about 2 hours late in picking us up at the port in Ushuaia because of a hurricane in the Drake channel. Oat decided to give every one of us a 200 dollar credit towards our next trip because of our delay. They really didn't have to do it because it was a nice day and there were plenety of things to keep us occupied in the port area. Also, the hurricane certainly wasn't their fault. YES, it was a good marketing ploy and you have to travel again with them to actually get the $200 but it still was a nice thing to do.People keep mentioning OAT's Very expensive insurance. Just remember you should have insurance but you definately don't have to buy it through OAT. Some people do because they like the comfort of knowing that the trip leader will know who to contact if they get ill, but i don't think it's worth it. Insurance was required for the Antarctic trip (just the medical portion). I bought insurance through a different company for a lot less and then gave a copy of the policy to the trip leader just in case.  One last thing. I have heard that some people are scared off from an Antarctic trip because of the scary Drake channel. We definately had people throwing up (their were barf bags tucked in all the ship railings) and i saw lots of little round anti nausea patches behind people's ears, also, the onboard doc talked to us individually and gave us appropriate motion sickness meds. I really had no idea how i'd react so i decided not to take anything and see what happened. Nothing happened. I was just fine, Point being if you are interested in a trip to Antartica with any tour company don't back out because of sea sickness worries. If you do get sick you will have lots of company and you may not get sick at all."
"You don’t have to buy the travel insurance from the tour company, cheaper if you shop around. Also your passport and wallet/IID should always be with you in a strapped on money holder or tummy pack, preferably in a zippered pocket. Or in a bolted down safe in your hotel room, always test the combo lock with a empty safe first. You learned a hard lesson the hard way."
"There is the saying ‘There’s a sucker born every minute.’, so OAT will never run out of customers, as there will always be new uninformed ones. I’m currently looking for a small group tour to Vietnam but reading numerous negative comments I’ve decided not to go with OAT. I have never been on one of their tours. We did a New Zealand small group tour with Gate 1 in 2018 that was great. Also did a first time Gate 1 river cruise from Amsterdam to Budapest that was just ok, there were initial airport transfer issues, an impatient guide in one of the German city stops, bad food on one of the substitute ships when low water required transferring to another shipmupstream, etc. Uniworld is so much better, I’ll stick to them for river cruises. Yet we have a friend who has gone on 16 OAT tours and swears by them and starting another next week to Asia. To each his/her own."
"I've only been on two of their trips but with the exception of a flight delay, they have been flawless. The Vietnam trip was the first 'group' trip (only 14) I've ever taken in my 70 years. It surpassed every expectation. I traveled solo with my own room...no single supplement. Our tour leader was fabulous. He was a boat person as a child and had chilling stories of 70's Vietnam. That said, customer service at OAT is only fair. Getting them to respond to an email is like pulling teeth. I did find that once I got someone on the phone, they were most helpful. I even got a free night in Vietnam because of a OAT paperwork glitch.My second trip was a year ago the GCT 'Cruising the Adriatic'. While not as good as Vietnam, certainly worthwhile. Our cruise directors were involved in the 90s Bosnian conflict and gave us great first hand history lessons about the war. The was a four hour delay and itinerary change that occurred going out of NYC, but the airlines handled it with aplomb and kept me informed thru regular emails.Hope this helps"
"To Traveling man....Vietnam was my second trip with OAT..We had a really great guide and a wonderful time. During one particularly long bus ride he entertained us with movies of his engagment and wedding. Aside from being entertaining it also gave us great insight into the culture. About the bad reviews, generally the people who go on sites like this go to bitch about something, not praise something, Just keep that in mind when you read the bad reviews of large companies. There are going to be bad reviews and bad travelers. It best to talk to people who have actually gone with a group to get the whole story.And yes, i seem to be posting mostly good reviews of Oat . Not sure why i have decided to become such a regular on this site since i don't post on any others. I'm not even on face book. Guess i just want to help level the playing field."
"I agree with your comment, there are bad travelers. Things happen, not all will go smoothly, learn to roll with the flow."
"Thanks everyone for their opinions... each tour company has similar but different itinerary details. I was hoping someone would also mention Gate1. I would like to try them. I tour a lot on my own but like an organized small group (15 or less) tour in the middle of my exploration to give some of the responsibility to someone else for a while! Since starting international travel in 1996, things are much easier with the Internet vs faxing reservations overnight and translating the response! At age 75, the price of insurance is really high... For insurance I have purchased ""TinLeg"" and ""Seven Corners"" and ""Arch Roamright"", but never used them...so I can not say how or if they pay on claims. I have toured with Viking, Globus, Insight, RoadScholar and Overseas... with Overseas having the smallest group.  I love TripAdvisor for the information on: Hotels, Local guides, transportation choices and the forums and conversations from those that have already experienced a location with suggestions, tips and explanations as well as some gentle warnings. YEA TripAdvisor"
"We have just come back from India on a Gate 1 tour, it was brilliant, I can’tpraise Them high enough for their attention to detail in all aspect. I intend in using them a lot more."
Why on earth did you leave your belongings (wallet and passports especially) in the car 18 hours before your departure?
do a search and there are many threads on Gate 1 on this forum and Bargain Travel. I'm leaving in a week for Croatia and they get good reviews.
"Thanks for the update... I will continue to search TRIPADVISOR..  Let us all know the details of your Croatia trip, it is on my list for next year....Thanks to everyone for keeping us up to date information on travel for seniors...."
@bigwheels - Why on earth would you respond to the OP who posted almost 6 years ago. Check the dates please.
"Please use a question mark after a question, interesting, hope this person has been appropriately admonished."
"I have been on 3 OAT trips. I have purchased travel protection through OAT. They use tripmate insurance.Granted it is expensive but so is the trip you are taking. I have filed 2 claims with tripmate for trips taken with another company. The paperwork is extensive but eventually you do get your money back in full. You can find cheaper insurance but not with the coverage offered by OAT. I am willing to pay more for cancellation up to day of departure. Being a senior one never knows what health issues might arise. I have checked other companies for same coverage as OAT’s Tripmate and it is higher for same coverage. OAT does an excellent job. Small group tours, great guides. Like all tour companies, they can not please everyone. I have been on several tours with other companies but I will only travel with OAT. My experience has been there is always good travel experiences along with some issues that are not so great."
"You should always have travel insurance, period. This has absolutely nothing to do with Overseas Adventure Travel of which I have been on several trips and they are fabulous"
"Travel Insurance is always a good idea. I've taken 7 trips with OAT and/or Grand Circle and have always gotten the Trip Mate insurance. On my last trip, I was injured and needed to file a claim with Trip Mate. They require that you do this all electronically. It is almost impossible to get Trip Mate on the phone, but their call-back system does work. They sometimes are not good about emailing you with progress reports, but that information will be in the file on their Website that they create when you submit your claim. Note that Trip Mate calls its insurance a supplementary insurance, which means they require you to file with your own domestic carrier first, regardless of who they are. Trip Mate said that if you had Medicare and/or TriCare, you only needed to provide your doctor's contact information. I did that and they still wanted me to file with my provider, an HMO I used through a Medicare Senior Advantage Plan. So here's the kicker: I filed my information with my HMO and received a check for all but $50.20, my co-pay. Now I am waiting ... and waiting for Trip Mate to reimburse me for that amount. So, check with your primary care system before you go overseas. All you really need, medically-speaking, is emergency medical care. If your primary care system will reimburse you for your expenses, or if you're visiting a socialized medicine country (France, Scandinavia, etc., where costs are very low, you may not need medical insurance at all. If you can find a way to separate the trip insurance from the health insurance, you may be better off. Trip Mate is not rated highly by any of the sites I visited and you can find lots of negative comments. At the end of the day, it's up to you. Get insurance if you need it, but there are lots of choices out there."
"I agree. I get minimal medical coverage because my insurance will pay for most of emergency med. I get good trip cancellation/delay etc. I compare policies on Squaremouth and Insure my trip. Both companies are consolidators who stand behind the companies they represent. Never had to file, but i'm sure my time is comming."
"Thank you so much, I did not realize Medicare would pay so much, since they do not cover ""out of country"" medical expense. Hopefully my separate supplemental would pay all reasonable costs.I will also try to review more closely the amount of coverage for cancellation due to my or a family member's emergency, or for delay. The airfare upgrade is so not transferable or refundable. Appreciate your information."
"I got sick during the 1st week on my OAT trip to Japan and had to return home. Luckily OAT's SE Asia Director had joined our group the day before I had to leave. Our trip guide was clueless about what to do, but the Director took charge. She made flight arrangements for my return home, escorted me back to Tokyo and reserved a hotel for my last night there. She provided names of OAT contacts, in Boston, in case of problems with my insurance claim. There were some ""minor"" problems and the Director as a CC on my emails certainly helped. Overall, I was very pleased with OAT's and the insurance company's handling of the situation.However, I cancelled a later trip to Europe, prior to departure. ALWAYS READ THE DETAILS OF THE ""CANCEL FOR ANY REASON"" PROVISIONS. My cancellation resulted in a CREDIT VOUCHER"" (good for 1 year - absolutely no extension possible) instead of a refund.I had difficulty finding & scheduling a suitable ""single"" trip within that 1 year time. Luckily I was able to book a trip for approximately $500 more than the voucher amount. FYI, if I had wanted travel insurance to cover that $500 (which I didn't of course), it would have cost almost $500. Think about it . . . pay $500 fo a $500 insurance.policy."
That's awful . so sorry!
"james r -( I am also James R) - I hope an OAT Director is on our trip to Australia in September, in case somone has a problem. Hope that you are well now.Not only does their agreement allow them to define any cancellation issues, the clueless guide is a contractor to OAT and OAT does not have any management or oversight responsibility with that guide.Enjoy your next trip"
Hi my husband and I are looking at traveling with gate1 to India and Nepal. Do you have any comments or sugestions. We are both in our mid 60's and although not super fit don't have any walking issues. Thanks
"I have traveled with OAT and Gate 1. The biggest difference is the number of travelers in your group. WITH OAT, there will be no more than 16. With Gate 1, you could have up to 40, unless you you book their smaller group or more deluxe option. That being said, Gate 1 has excellent guides and accommodations may be better than OAT. For the price Gate 1 is hard to beat."
I took the Heart of India tour with OAT and I have to say it was definitely one of my favorites. They did an outstanding job. The small group difference really makes all the difference in the world for a place like India and the special stuff they did made it really a wonderful visit. I went when I was 64. Took my 32 year old son with me. Groups with OAT are very active. If this is your first trip with OAT they offer a special one time $100 discount for first time travelers when you say you are referred by a prior traveler. You can easil;y find them on the web (Trip Advisor doesn't allow self-promotion). Do it. Most memorable trip. And a good company. I just booked their trip to Norway and Finland for next year.
"For long trips, always recommended to get insurance, I mean really, many things could go wrong and you just want to be covered when it happens. Just make sense."
Still waiting to hear a comparison between OAT and Gate1Travel. Contemplating a trip to Israel in 2020.
"OAT is a little more expensive but tends to include much more which often are not included on GATE 1 or sold as optionals (optionals are often strongly encouraged by the leader). That said, I would say you get what you pay for and in general I would favor OAT because of the small group nature, and those little extras that I have found make the trip valuable. I have not taken their trip to Israel but have taken 10 trips with OAT/Grand Circle and often find folks on our tours who have taken more than we have. Finally (this will save you a little). OAT offers a first time traveler a $100 per-person savings."
"Appreciate the response. We have, in fact, taken 3 trips with OAT and had no serious complaints although the lodging(s) were not necessarily top-notch. Recently a friend suggested trying Gate1travel."
"Hi, I just returned from the Israel trip with OAT. It was great and the lodging was top notch as was the food. We had a wonderful guide, Rafi, who turned 2 weeks of history lessons into one long interesting story. This was my 16 or 17 trip with OAT (have also traveled independently and with other small groups) and was definately one of the best.. I have never traveled with GATE1 so can't comment on them. Lots of friends also like Road Scholar but they are more expensive, charge a single supplement and the groups arae a little larger than OAT so OAT is usually my first choice.So, go with OAT to Israel and have a great time.Edited: 11:43 am, October 31, 2019 "
"Ha! We bought their expensive insurance and boy did they NOT stand behind it!!! OAT didn't give us enough time to make the airline flight connection and with having to go through customs, pick up our bags and go through security twice, we missed our connection from Dallas to Indianapolis. That very expensive insurance company through OAT, which OAT now tells me they have DROPPED, did NOT honor our measly $235 claim because they say it wasn't a delay due to weather, machinery, etc. When we tried to get help from OAT, (which remember it was their fault for the inadequate connection time), they simply ignored our calls for three weeks, never called back with any kind of resolution and in week three of this, REFERRED US BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY!! And this despite our having traveled with them already 7 times and spending close to $100,000. Additionally, we have referred two friends to OAT who have spent about the same. OAT has gotten too big for its britches so to speak. It takes forever to get through and the trips aren't as good for the money as they used to be years ago. They have become a lot more expensive and there are many other companies out there. I will be looking at these and will no longer be giving OAT our hard earned dollars. It's hard for me to believe that despite the money already spent with them and probably a quarter of a million to go, (which we explained to them was in our budget), they could BLOW US OFF so easily. It's clear that we just aren't important to them. When this happens a company has just become too big and impersonal. Be careful yourselves. Travel should not be stressful and so we are done with OAT."

"Hi All,Sorry for the multiple response which is supposed to be in response to the top comment about recommending one buy the OAT insurance. I thought my reply would go under that comment! and was trying to get it there. I'm new to posting, so again sorry about that!"
"We have traveled with OAT/GCT 12 times. Obviously, we like many things about them. However, we have stopped buying their insurance. You can get a comprehensive policy like theirs for a lot less through brick and mortar or internet travel insurance brokers. However, if you have the right credit card you can get the most expensive part of the insurance (trip cancellation/interruption) for free and then just supplement that with a low cost medical/emergency evacuation policy."
Did you also go to Jordan and Egypt on a SuezCrossing? What about attire for a woman? What did you NOT bring that you wished you had?
"Hi, i am assuming that you are referring to my post about my trip to Israel. I did not take the jordan/Egypt trip because i was there on an OAT trip about 10 years ago. As far as clothing choices for Israel, there are some places where they would prefer that your shoulders and legs (above the Knees) are covered. Some people thought they needed skirts, which was not the case. long capris are just fine as are tshirts with some sort of sleeves. I like skirts and i wore them..but not necessary. I was happy with my combination of shirts,skirts, tops and capri's.I didn't bring any of my shawls because they were all patterened (bought on trips to india and nepal) but because occasionally it got cooler at night i think a neutral shawl would have been nice. Also i;m realy glad i brought a light weight hat with a little brim. It really got hot sometimes and altho i generally don't wear a hat, it really helped. Also, i usually whah out clothes at the end of the day but that didn't work all that well in Israel. Stuff didn;t dry well. It didn't feel all that humid but it took 2 night to get something dry in a hotel room."
"I just returned from OAT's Colombia's Colonial Jewels & The Coffee Triangle tour and for those considering a visit to Colombia, I would strongly recommend going and would also suggest this as a great way to experience this rapidly changing country.OAT really has put together an incredible package. We had truly excellent guides in each city (in addition to our overall Tour Director). The hotels were perfectly located in safe and central districts of each city. The visits with locals (what makes OAT a unique company in my opinion) were excellent. I invite you to read my personal blog review where you can also access a video of our trip at https://bit.ly/2S5A7l7 We were concerned about going to Colombia but after having visited, I can say that the only risk you'll face is wanting to see a little more. NOW is really the ideal time to visit this country and see what is taking place. It's also incredibly pretty (greener than Ireland and Scotland in many parts)."
"i went to Columbia with OAT 3 years ago and i completely agree with you. I booked it 5 days before the trip started (they were holding out for a couple but finally made it a single for me). It was fun, safe and just easy and relaxing, I did eat a lot of pizza tho when we had dinner on our own because not many people spoke english so pizza was easier than the unknown."
"Thanks for this input. I traveled with OAT once and had a good, not great experience. Recommend you look into GATE 1 travel."

Has anyone had any experience with OAT - not the traveler - canceling a trip. In this case I am already paid up for China/Tibet in the Spring but the concern is the current health corona/Wuhan virus. I have not purchased insurance through OAT
Purchase insurance from a separate company.
"I know this is a little late and you have probably already been notified by OAT. If not, call them. They have already sent me a note About my trip to turkey in the fall saying they are monitoring the situation.About the insurance. You should always purchase trip insurance and can still do it with an outside vendor, which is more economical, but it may not cover trip cancellation if you just are nervous about going, There has to be a reason that is stated on the policy. My guess is if it's dire enough for trip insurance to cover, OAT will likely have already canceled the trip. Good luck.Edited: 2:16 pm, January 24, 2020 "
OAT continues to sell their travel insurance without telling customers that a major exclusion is an epidemic which is of utmost concern to all travelers at this time. Major unethical behavior.
"I am so sorry this happened to you! We had a minor issue with the OAT insurance and their taking responsibility, but it was enough for us to look elsewhere for our next trip. We believe OAT has gotten too big to worry about its individual travelers, which is just too bad. Again, so sorry this happened to you and OAT was so unresponsive. You'd think they could just be more flexible just for the public relations, if nothing else. After all, how often can this kind of thing happen relative to all of the trips that go without a hitch?"
"According to what I have been reading, NONE of the travel insurers is reimbursing for trips canceled by the traveler due to coronavirus, even if there is a CDC Level 3 (do not travel) alert in place, as with China. And if you buy the insurance now for a future trip, coronavirus cancellation will not be covered unless you purchase the very expensive ""Cancel for Any Reason"" insurance. But CFAR insurance only reimburses for 75% of the trip cost. I do not know whether you would be covered if you fall ill of coronavirus while on your trip; that would be a question to ask before buying coverage.Also, it has been my experience that you get better coverage for less cost if you buy travel insurance separately from what a tour company offers. I imagine they get a commission which, of course, you are paying. Finally, always, always read the fine print. Don't just assume you are covered for some event."
"Thanks for your posts! We decided a while ago never to go with OAT again. We were on one trip that was good, and then we took a very expensive trip to Jpn and it was not good at all. The company only cares for its profits! I wrote a detailed feed back and filled out every question in the questionnaire they sent to me. I called them twice, I never got a call back. Nobody cared to talk to me and explain why this trip was a sheer waste of money. The company is far too big. It does nt care at all about its passengers. It still enjoys a good reputation, but we hope more and more people will come to the conclusion we reached. Most of our friends will never take a trip with them. We make sure to tell everyone about our bad experience. Very poor itinerary. A guide who did not speak an intelligible English. Hotels that were not on the right level. No response to passengers' requests or comments."
"This is so interesting. I have taken 17 trips with them and have had no real issues that impact my trip. I gave only one of those trips a neg rating because it just was kinda blah, and so was the guide. They read my rating and gave me a $250 credit on my next trip. That was about 5 years ago. Had no issues since then. In fact, I have booked a trip to turkey this fall and just received an email telling me not to worry, that if there were problems in turkey they would not do the trip.I wasn't worried but it was nice to hear. Guess when you book through a big company you can have very different levels of satisfaction ."
"I believe that the company has changed!! I wrote a negative review. I called twice and I specifically asked to have a supervisor talk to me. Nobody did! They are wrong to ignore customers. They already lost several passengers just because of our experience. I think tat since so many people went with them several times, they are too smug. Too big, Too self assured. We heard the same from other friends. God luck to you! I am glad to hear you had a good experience.."
"This is a warning about OAT. They are telling me that I can cancel our fully paid trip to Japan in April only if I accept a $6000 deduction from the refund. SInce United has seen fit to cancel all flights to Japan thru April, and since the US government warns older people not to go there (we are in our 70s), this strikes me as a way OAT is trying to profit off of the corona virus, by getting people to cancel before the trip is officially cancelled. Although their message when you call says safety is their utmost concern, in my opinion this is clearly not the case....money is!"
"We fully agree! OT HAS BECOME A MONEY-FIRST-PRIORITY COMPANY, We will NEVER take another trip with them. We tried to talk to someone to tell them what was wrong in our last trip, but they do not care... There are enough fools who are used to ging with them. We are hapy each time we succeed in changing friend's plan ton travel with them. Hopefully, if enough people will ge the message, they will start thinking about the passengers and not just their pockets..."
"savtata, if you have a bad meal in a restaurant after having a good experience, do you also go on a crusade to bad mouth the restaurant? The fact that OAT has customers that have gone on as many as 50 trips with them should be testament that they are essentially a very good company. We have neighbors who have been on the Japan trip and they raved about it. We have been on 13 trips with them and have only had one partial experience that I would rate as average. I would certainly never go on a mission to destroy the company because of this one less than stellar portion of a trip. Could it be that you had a uniquely bad experience as any travel company is bound to have?Edited: 7:26 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"We have a similar experience. We paid for an OAT trip to Italy in April. In Feb N CoVid-19 exploded in Italy. CDC issued travel warning Level 2 on 2/23, Level 3 on 2/18 and Level 4 on 2/29 with over 2,000 cases by 3/3/20. I have spoken with OAT multiple times and even emailed to their CEO but never heard from him. Got an email from customer relation giving us the option of either postponing the trip or find another trip. I like a full refund because who wants to travel at this time. We are elderly, don’t even know if we will be here next year. With travel warning of Level 4 they should really cancel the trip and offer full refund. They said customer safety is top priority but obviously their bottom line is really their first priority. We are truly disappointed."
"You are right. I tried to reach their upper management since they did not cancel the trip to Italy despite of Level 4 warning issued by CDC. I never got a response. Yes, they said customer safety is their priority. I think money is their priority. I would never go on a trip with them."
"As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. OAT may be good in general but it only takes one bad deed to ruin their reputation especially in the wake of the Corona Virus with Level 4 warning they still insist that it is safe to go."
Did you know you can go to the District Attorney General and file a complain with them? You can also go to Better Business Bureau and do the same. If enough people do that may be someone will listen. Maybe OAT has so many customers they don't care dropping a few like us

"We're actively reaching out to our travelers on departures impacted by coronavirus and continue to closely monitor the situation. Please see updated information here: oattravel.com/marketing/…coronavirus-update Thank you for your patience!Edited: 12:45 pm, March 06, 2020 "
Thank you OAT for reaching out to your Italy trip clients today offering them 3 options:1) Delaying/postponing the Italy trip2) Pick another destination3) Cancel with full refundOption 3 was recently added. The refund will be forth coming towards the end of April. That was the wise thing to do. Our appreciation for your move in the right direction.
"Why is OAT so slow in cancelling trips? Today, Rick Steves reacted swiftly to the Level 3 (same as Iran and China) CDC alert on Europe and cancelled ALL Europe trips starting before April 19. OAT has just cancelled trips to parts of Italy and one from Romania to Hungary. What's with OAT? This is a crisis. Do the right thing--like Rick!"
"John, did you also see that Road Scholar has also cancelled trips WORLDWIDE through the end of April?Rick Steves Europe has been very responsive as you noted. I feel so bad for their vendors as he often uses family owned smaller hotels and restaurants so they will be hurting with the lack of business. Still RSE has no other choice at this point.I cannot imagine the chaos at the tour company offices."
#378OAT doesn’t have a trip from Romania to Hungary
"Rather than relying on what people claim to be true regarding OAT's policies for cancellation, perhaps it's best to go to the source:https:/…coronavirus-update"
so true
"OAT is so unscrupulous that we are furious. Booked Greek Islands small ship and Turkey pre trip Land Tour for June 26th of 2020, which is in about 3 months. Our date to pay for the trip is March 28. They say we can move deposit to a later 2021 trip but most are not even up on the web site.We gave them a $1000 deposit. in January...They refund all of the money if the trip cancels. So for example they have only canceled Italy through May thereby holding onto peoples money who may be booked for June. There is no way on the face of the earth anyone is going to Italy for a long long while. So for us we know if we pay in full which is like 13K we owe now, and it cancels forJune, we supposedly get a full refund. (if they are still in business) Well I do not want to pay in full knowing that this trip is going to cancel for June 26. They have canceled many Asia trips for 2020 and 2021 but they are not doing this for Europe yet, thereby holding onto deposits and payments in full on 2020 trips that are more than 90 days out. This is a disgrace. We asked for our deposit back or for them to make an exception and we have not heard back. It's unlikely we will get our deposit back. We can't even buy trip insurance as we are past the initial 21 day purchase trip insurance requirement that most travel insurance companies require for buying ""cancel for any reason"" policies. Nobody is even selling the medical bills and evacuation only policies. We have traveled with them 7 times but we are at the end of the line. We don't want to go anywhere in 2021 especially not on a small trip adventure which our trip is....Good Luck to all dealing with them."
"Look on the bright side: if you had bought the travel insurance already, you would not get a refund for that either. We had a trip to Italy w/ another company which they canceled. We got everything refunded but not the $800+ of travel insurance premium which we bought separately w/in 2 weeks of booking in order to get coverage for pre-existing conditions. I didn't buy CFAR insurance; it's too pricy. I would certainly not pay the balance on March 28th. They may refund the deposit in due course. Odysseys Unlimited, says they are waiting until 45 days prior to departure to cancel Europe trips with departure dates after May 31.In fairness, these travel companies are slammed. They have payroll to meet and overhead yet they have zero revenue. And in some states, most or all employees are working from home.Edited: 2:47 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"We’ve taken 8 trips with OAT over a twenty-year period. The big improvement is they will work with you to select flights of your choice, including the airline and business class if you desire. I search flights before calling them, so I know what to request. We always go a day early, and they help us get their special hotel rate. Their small ship cruises are our choice among their offerings. We think they skimp on the quality of hotels on land tours—often in poor locations. Guides have always been exceptional.As to insurance, it always pays to shop around."
"We purchased a travel policy from Alliannz through OAT/GST for a trip they cancelled due to the virus. A few days ago we were notified that the payment we made for the travel policy will be refunded to us. OAT is also refunding our payments for the trip, or allowing us to apply the money to another booking."
"RE OVERSEAS ADVENTURE TRAVEL - OATThey have decided no longer to give Option #3 which I requested for a full refund. The company now will only allow me to book the Egypt trip in 2021 or another trip. They are transferring my money without my permission. So book a trip or lose my money. Yes, a trying time for all, but they are taking advantage of the situation.I have had numerous conversations and emails with them. Other travel companies have refunded money!"
"After numerous government statements about avoiding travel, especially on ships, OAT did not cancel my trip to Egypt until the day before departure. They changed their original policy as of this week, and will no longer refund money. Either you book another trip with them or lose your money. They are transferring my money to another trip without my permission!"
They have since reneged on their promise. They are no longer offering a refund.
Would like to know if you actually got the refund.
"They say ""more than 50,000 travelers still plan to travel with us"". Well, yes, because they have no other option. It may be that the company will go under in the next year, in which case we probably get nothing."
"Not only will they arbitrarily move your trip to 2021, they will not even answer the phone now and won't respond to emails. Viking has willingly refunded, or given me a 125% credit if I desired, for the 3 cruises already cancelled in 2020. Never again will I use OAT and I will tell everyone to stay away from them. I hope they do file bankruptcy. By the way, their travel insurance is useless because the policy doesn't cover ""epidemics""."
Sounded great but then out sent a message saying that their policy had changed and there would not be any cash refunds. Only looking another trip which they did automatically for us.
"I always buy the insurance and they are renigging on this too. They have electronically removed my payment for the insurance and are now saying inrefused it. I have a paper copy of the original, however."
Time to sue them!
"I understand because we were assigned to another trip in 2021. Since we do not know if we will have a vaccine for CoVid 19 next year. We do not want to plan for 2021. If you sue them, for sure they will call you bluff. You can go to Better Business Bureau OAT review and file a complain. The last I went to their web site there were at least 10 cases and all got refund fairly quickly. Good Luck you deserve to have your money return to you. What fair is fair. I don't understand why OAT hold on to our money."
"I so agree, my first time taking a tour only to Croatia, No flight involved, and they just announced that May trips are postponed for next May 2021, it is 13 month away and I can't go neither my partner who I dragged her to join me for my 70th birthday. Calling, sending emails numbers time with no results insight. They informed When I asked about the trip for May, once the trip is canceled they will refund the money that was in the beginning of April. How are we suppose to know what to do at this point with misleading messages? Just last week only I find out they are postponing May trips. I scheduled a supervisor phone call, after 8 days waiting, I got Zac Powell on the phone who was unsympathetic to my needs and concern and bluntly did not want to discuss anything regarding a refund, what a shame! This has been stressful experience with Overseas Adventure that I never expected at all!! as senior, I am going through very stressful time trying to figure out what to do at this point. I am turning to the media to get involved with the issue of hassle for senior travel refunds!!! They need to change their policy to give customer a choice to cancel or reschedule if they wish and get full refund since they are unable to fulfill or provide a trip as scheduled originally.Edited: 11:40 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"We have the same dreadful, stressful experience, They gave us travel voucher for next year on the assumption we still want to do business with them. Who knows what will happen next year. Elizabeth, I suggest you contact Better Business Bureau _OAT review and file a complain. Last, I checked they have at least 10 cases and all got resolved - money back. Good luck Elizabeth! We deserve to get our money back. We are very disappointed with OAT this time. They try to convince us that this is the industry standard - issuing travel vouchers."
"Yes I found out the hard way that OAT insurance is very expensive and totally useless. If you want your money back take it to Better Business Bureau and file a complain(look under OAT review), There are quite a number of complains and all get their money back. Good luck!"
I just filed my OAT complaint with the BBB.
"Good.. Your case will get resolved soon with BBB and you can put a review in Trip Advisor and share your experience. I did not do it that way, but I also appeal to local public media. It got resolved too. Its very stupid that OAT ruined their reputation this way."
"OAT cancelled our trip because of COVID19. Because of COVID19 OAT cancelled our trip for which we had fully paid. They will not refund our money. They offered the same trip ‘some time next year’When we paid for the trip, the cancellation Policy on their website said if OAT cancels the trip you get a full refund.’Now they say they have changed the policy.We had bought trip insurance through them and all the insurer did was refund what we paid for the insurance.We’ve lost ove $16,000 dollars.I think theft is a good word"
"We paid $23,000 a year ago for advance reservations for a trip to South Africa for this May/June. Due to the Corona virus they ""postponed"" the trip and rebooked us to 2021 without our consent. Of course most people would call that a cancellation. They refused to refund our money and offered a mere $500 credit. That amounts to 1% a year on our deposit. They claim people a very happy with that credit. Obviously not based on the reviews! We even took out their overpriced insurance. But to no avail as this was ""cancelled"" on OAT direction but merely a ""postponement"". Since the experts claim it could be 12 to 18 months before a vaccine will be available. Does OAT really think it will be safe to travel to South Africa next May? Warning, any money you place with OAT for a trip is no longer your! Avoid this company!"
"i agree that OAT is not playing fair on this. I have a trip to turkey this fall which i suspect will also be ""postponed"". Just a FYI though. I never take OAT's insurance, i always shop for my own. As far as i can tell, none of the policies cover ""pandemics"" and altho some may cover bankruptcy it is usually an add on, which i have never added on."
"Question: if you won't fly on Air India because of safety concerns, why the heck would you go to India? With you aversion to risk maybe you'd be better off going to Disney World (how boring!!)."
"Michael I, not sure who you are responding to regarding the Air India comment but just be aware that even though there is a ""Reply"" button at the bottom of each post, all replies are stacked at the bottom.Also be aware this thread has been going since June 2013 so it's possible/probable that whoever you are responding to is no longer active on TA."
"They did the same thing to me. They removed my travel insurance, did not refund that money, and said that I refused it. They are acting in bad faith. We are speaking with an attorney, but I'd love to know if anyone was successful in getting their money back by going a different route."
"There are many hard feelings and angry customers over O.A.T changing policy regarding cancelled trips and refusal to refund customer's money after agreeing to refunds.  The company has shut down it's Travel Forum. The forum is where many customers have vented their frustration these last weeks.The Forum was unique place where travelers could exchange information and tips about trips taken and trips planned. Also make comments about how well things did or did not go with specific trips.Recently a travel magazine ran an article about the best keep secret in the travel industry, it says companies use monies paid for future trips for today's bills. Industry insiders knew it would just be a matter of time until a major economic upheaval exposed the practice and for the industry to collapse. That time may be now."
Please file bankruptcy. At least travel insurance covers that.
most insurance plans don't cover bankruptcy unless you specifically opted in for it. With all the trips i have pending and paid for I may have to be the one to file bankruptcy
"OAT may shut down its Travel Forum on their web site but all you have to do is search for ""OAT reviews"" and you will find many complains mainly in Better Business Bureau and other places concerning the same issue, that is, OAT reneged on their promise of a full refund. I just hope they did not invest future travelers' money in the stock market. As with many business, one have to anticipate bad years too. They have many good years already and many loyal customers."
"I just got a phone call from OAT regarding my complaint to the BBB. Needless to say their response was we have no intention of making any refunds. They started in their spiel about what they will do but I told them if they have no intention of refunding monies, we have nothing further to discuss. I guess they spent all the monies we prepaid for their current expenses. I guess the company won't be in business much longer."
"Before the Travel Forum was shut down some posters suggested filing a complaint with the Mass. Attorney General's office.There was also a link to a state regulation mandating refunds. Might be worth a call.I stopped traveling with o.a.t. after several trips in a row had problems. Plus they were making changes to trips and solo policies that were not traveler friendly.It's sad that what was an excellent travel company no longer is.Edited: 12:55 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"Douglasf719 I don't think it is up to OAT to decided whether or not they are going to give up a refund. Even if they refuse, BBB can make them comply and give you a full refund. You have nothing to loose. If that does not work, then, as TMP said file a complaint with the Mass. Attorney General's office. If that does work, call up your local media and see if anyone is interested in doing a story on OAT. Be persistent! Let us know what the outcome is."
"Haven't heard from the BBB yet regarding OAT's phone call to me today. I've already done a search and found a Boston attorney who does travel claims and reached out to him. Found the complaint form on the Atty Gen'l web site and book marked it. I won't be giving up and since I still have insurance for the rescheduled trip I can probably get (a legitimate) excuse from my Doctor. If OAT won't reimburse me, I will make them lose them a lot of money. I've already stopped one person from booking with them.Edited: 2:34 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"I am going on a trip in the next 6 months with OAT and spoke to them about booking the airfare. I was told it was 1500 to book a coach seat but that I can upgrade to business class for around 1500-2K. I called to upgrade and they said 3500 in addition. I told them the ticket is anywhere from 3-3600 to Europe online, Why would you charge me 1500 + 3500 or 5K for a ticket that is 3500. It appears that I am getting zero credit for the 1500 I already paid and feel like they are offering me to buy a coach ticket and a business class ticket. I am super disappointed that I was misled. No one is going to buy a 3500 ticket for 5K."
"Welcome to OAT. Every other travel company I've used, business class is no problem. With OAT you are hard pressed to get business travel. They gave me a mixed flight of business and premium economy. Be glad you don't have any more money than you have to with them. Who knows if they will even be around in 6 months."
"Often you get better flights, connections, cost when you book yourself instead of using O.A.T. air. Yes, you'll have to pay for the transfer from the airport to the first hotel, but may be worth it. Often arranging the transfer yourself is cheaper than what O.A.T. will charge.O.A.T.'s is under a lot of pressure right now and probably cash poor. They may have upped their usual upcharge for arranging flights."
"Interesting that you read the OAT complaints on BBB and learned that they had all succeeded in getting a refund. I read these as well, but it was just an OAT rep saying that they had come to an agreement with the plaintiff. It does NOT say that they were refunded. FAT CHANCE!I say this simply because I have the same problem, even after dealing with OAT for over 20 years! I do not think we will see any refunds at all. The old saying applies: You can't get blood out of a stone! I do not think they have any money to refund!! I would be happy to see half of the $10,000 they owe me. The killer is that they can declare bankruptcy and come back to cheat you another day. Case in point: Our President.Good luck!Ga"
"Thank you for your post Ga. Our trip with OAT was cancelled, Initially they offered a full refund which we promptly opted for. Then they change their mind and said no refund. Instead we were assigned to a different trip (of different destination) in May 2021. We thought we had no choice but we quickly realize that other people were also complaining and seems that their complaints were resolved fairly quickly. We did not go the BBB route because we were already in contact with a media which promised to look into it for us. Meanwhile they still said it is industry standard not to refund. We know other companies like Rick Steve's refunded his clients. OAT refunded us only because they did not want the story to be published. So Ga don't give up. $10,000 is a lot of money. If OAT cancelled you, you should have a full refund. (I know if you cancel them you only get a small refund.) If BBB does not work for you then file a complaint with the Mass. Attorney General's office. Be persistent. If anyone successfully got a full refund from OAT then please publish your story that will give hope to those who are in the middle of the struggle."
"OAT called me after they got the complaint via the BBB. Basically they said no refund! On March 22 however their email to me said I would have to pay a cancellation fee but I could get a refund. Ha, ha, ha. They are not honoring what they said. On May 6, OAT responded to the BBB that they received the complaint and hope to resolve it. So, now I have sent more info to the BBB. I even inquired of one Boston lawyer, who claims to handle travel problems, and he never even responded to me. Guess I'll have to try more as well as the Attorney General."
"Based on posts on other websites filing a complaint with the Mass. Attorney General is the wat to go.As I mentioned in an earlier post, a travel agency regulation in Mass. requires full refund of cancelled trips...if requested.So far only the AGs office has wrangled refunds out of o.a.t...but only if they cancelled the trip."
Just filed my complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General.
The Massachusetts State Attorney General's Office told me that I could file a BBB complaint at the same time I filed with them. So no need to wait for a refusal of a refund via the BBB in order to file a complaint with the AG.
"What is the penalty if OAT breaks 940 Mass. Reg. 15.06 Mass AG law? I too have filed a complaint with BBB, Mass AG and Federal Trade commission.Edited: 10:42 am, May 10, 2020 "
"Probably nothing, especially if they have no money and file bankruptcy. They'll then just reopen again with a new name."
"I looked up the reg. It's a violation of Mass fair practices act. Very long and full of legalese.Bottom line if the AG opens an investigation and the media is aware it's really bad press for O.A.T.It's always a matter of numbers. The more people who file complaints the more pressure on the AG to act.O.A.T. needs to understand that what they did is both unethical and unlawful.Edited: 12:01 pm, May 10, 2020 "
"We too learned OAT changed the refund policy by ""executive decision"" after learning only by accident we were rebooked on a tour in May 2021 without our knowledge or consent. OAT never contacted us about cancelling our trip or rebooking us on a trip next year,. We wrote letters and emails with no response. We filed a Better Business Bureau (BBB) complaint and a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint, and we are now seeking an attorney interested in pursuing a class action suite against OAT."
Let me know if you find an attorney. I tried contacting one and they never got back to me. Probably not enough in it for the attorney. They are only about how much they will make.
"Thanks Douglas719 for your update and CH-47Super-C for your suggestion of using Federal Trade Commission as another route to get back your money. Many are cheering you on and wishing you the best. I was wondering whether you could even classified this case as ""senior abuse"" (financial of course). They cannot just randomly assigned people to another tour at another date without first consulting them. That is at best bad business practice. They should just give you a full refund. Their once sterling reputation is at stake."
"We too are currently out of $14,000. OAT is definitely unethical by retaining funds for services not rendered. I believe this constitutes fraud. We have contacted our credit card company and filed a dispute; we filed a complaint with the FTC; we filed a complaint with the BBB and I am going to pursue the Attorney General's office next. Since OAT is retaining funds without providing a service, can't I charge them interest? I have no evidence on my account page that my trip to Italy was cancelled. I received a post-dated Travel insurance cancellation notice and absolutely NO written information or notice from the company. Everything is verbal therefore there is no paper trail other than the papers I have on file. I have no intentions of traveling with this company in the future even though we have recommended them to others and have taken at least 7 trips with them. Very disappointing. Fraudulent business practices indeed."
There is anotger trip advisor forum about O.A T. It's titled Overseas Adventure Travel...without the hyphen and OAT.There are several posts you may find helpful.
Hurrah! Just received my 100% refund for my safari to Africa. Don't know if it was the BBB complaint or the letter to the Massachusetts Attorney General but I got all $25K back. They would have saved a lot of trouble and bad publicity if they just did it to start with.
"I am sorry for your experience...but being an OAT fan, I know you were encouraged to buy insurance. Being over 70 We would NEVER travel without trip insurance...anywhere. Several years ago while on an OAT trip to Africa, my husband became very ill, OAT could not have been nicer or treated us better. They got us an upgraded flight home, put us in a five star hotel and drove for hours to pick us up and deliver us. They turned an awful experience into a happy memorable one....it was different, but it was excellent."
"Congrats Douglas719!!! We are so happy for you. Your persistence paid off. $25K is no small pocket change. Even though when we traveled with OAT last year to Croatia we had a good experience. However, this time, it really gave us a very negative experience. I tried so many times to get a full refund from them, nothing works, until I contacted a local media and threaten to expose what they are doing to their clients. In the end, we got a full refund. Once bitten twice shy. We are hesitant to do business with them."
I won't do business with them again. Period!
"Rita Shar, even if OAT pays you interest for your $14,000, there is no guarantee that next year will be safe to travel. What if the virus is still around and there is no vaccine? Then are you going to go through the same agony one more time. Once is already too many. You did the right thing by filing complains with credit card company, BBB, AG, FTC your persistence will pay off. We are waiting to hear your success story just like douglas719. Your success story is a tremendous encouragement to those who are still struggling for a full refund."
My trip to South Korea and Japan in May 2020 was canceled by OAT in February due to the Covid-19 with an assurance that I would be refunded in full. I accepted their offer of a full refund. OAT then canceled the insurance I purchased through OAT. I too have had many wonderful trips with OAT but they said in writing and a telephonic conformation that I would be refunded in full by 4/4 /2020. That did not happen. Much back and forth and I have filed numerous complaints with state and federal agencies..
"To those who were denied a promised refund from OAT: File a complaint with the Massachusetts State Attorney General's Office. The form is online, simple, and straightforward. They took my case and I received a refund in a few weeks. Good luck!"
I got my refund also right away after contacting the BBB and Attorney General.
"Good Luck and stay on it I was refunded today after filing complaints with Chase, BBB, Mass AG, FTC. Nothing like a disgruntled senior who hates lying and cheating and has time due to stay-at-home orders! Be Healthy and safe travels in the future!"
"OAT/Grand Circle have destroyed their reputation, which had been getting shaky over the last few years. More free time, fewer meals, travel dates over holidays when parts of the itinerary were closed. Comments made on the now closed FORUM tried to get the company to address these concerns and others, without any luck.The idea that the company was unaware of the state regulation requiring them to refund traveler's money IF the company cancels the tour AND the traveler requested their money back is unbelievable. But just another example of how the company has deteriorated and how it takes their customers for granted.Congratulations to all who have fought the good fight and got their money back!"
"After I got my money back last week, I received a letter from them yesterday. It basically said we're sorry for our bad service and we are giving you both a $500 credit on future travel. Ha, Ha, Ha? No fricking way will I ever use OAT again. Too many reputable companies out there."
"I did file with BBB re our Gems of Europe trip with OAT mentioned above.They had originally promised a full cash refund (minus a $300 penalty fee), and that was fine with us. When after a month they did not come through, I called them again and was told basically that there would be no refund, they had changed the terms and conditions after the fact, and that we would receive a voucher for the full amount. WONDERFUL!I contacted BBB and filed a claim there, thinking it would do no good, but I couldn't come up with a better alternative. This was roughly on May 6, 2020. On Thursday I received a call from OAT during which they apologized profusely and said that the full cash refund would indeed be offered. That made me happy, of course.I went back to the BBB and told them that this problem had been resolved to my satisfaction and that all is now fine and dandy. I am now having second thoughts as to whether I should have done that already. By now, I do not trust OAT at all. They told me once before that they would refund my $$ and never did. Time will tell if they are sincere this time.If I do NOT get my money, I will be sure to let you know.Georgia"
Be sure to file with the Atty General if no money received.
"Thanks, douglas.Massachusetts Attorney General was next on my list, but it is great to hear that their website makes it easy, and that you have been successful thru them. If I see no $$ by 10 June, I'm on it!"
"Gabber, You can certainly do both at the same time ( file a complain at BBB and also at Mass Attorney General). Better still, give OAT a call, give them an ultimatum, if you do not hear from them within 48 hours or by Wed. since tomorrow is memorial day, you will then file with Mass Attorney General. Also you need it in writing. That way hopefully they will get on your case faster and not call you bluff."
"Don't bother trying to call them. They will never answer the phone. They also take forever to answer an email, if they even answer."
"We have a trip to Morocco scheduled for September. To date, it has not been canceled or postponed. I am in wait and see mode for another month. We also bought their expensive CFAR insurance and finding out that is a misnomer. It does not apply to this situation. If you got a refund on your trip, did you also get a refund on the trip insurance? Thanks."
"Thanks for your great advice and direction Douglasf719. My calls to OAT were filled with lies and false promises. Only to be followed by them deciding that they are changing their minds and no longer offering what was promised. I got nowhere until I followed your sage advice of involving BBB, MAG and FTC. Finally, I was got the credit on my credit card today. Thank you, thank you, thank you.Edited: 9:54 am, May 26, 2020 "
"Yes, even received a refund of the trip insurance premium."
Thank you.
"Yankeegirl, I think I probably gave this advice to you on another forum, but you might consider contacting the Insurance Commission in your state about getting a refund on your premium. At the very least they may have some advice on what is happening with others in the same situation."
"Thanks. It seems others have gotten a refund of their deposit, etc. from OAT. They have not canceled or postponed our tour yet but will probably do so another month. I wouldn’t mind if it was just the deposit at stake but we upgraded our flights and shelled out for the CFAR insurance so we are out of pocket close to $3,000. and who knows when it will be safe to travel again. I will never book with OAT again and will stick with RS and Odysseys."
Please accept our apologies for the delay in responding to emails and calls. We understand the frustration this has caused. Please email us your details at request@oattravel.com and we will look into your refund status. Thank you!
"OAT is refusing to honor its cancellation policy that provides a cash refund of all but $300 for cancellations 90 days before departure. Although their site says you can take a credit for the full amount of the trip if you want to cancel an existing trip and aren't ready to rebook, they are charging the $300 fee. In my case they did not tell me until after I said I needed to cancel a September trip that they would not honor the refund part of the cancellation policy I had agreed to when I booked but would be imposing the $300 penalty from that policy. When I pointed out that their current policy allowed for a credit for the full value of the trip (no $300 penalty) they said I was out of luck because I had cancelled not deferred -- even though all I have is a credit for some deferred future trip."
"The good news is that MOST of the $$ they owe me showed up in my checking account a few days ago. For this I am very happy, and so glad that they are being forced to do the right thing. This is NOT the way things are working in 2020 so far. So Bravo!They still owe me my $500 deposit which was paid by a credit card, which was subsequently defrauded, and a new card issued. Initially they said this would come to me via check, which it has not yet, but I think they need some time. I was told that they would try to refund via the old card; if it did not go thru, then they would send a check...the very SLOWEST way anyone can to ANYTHING! I hate checks!In any case, I will give OAT an 80% bravo on their rebound. (As if they had any choice.)Thanks for your commiseration!And best of luck to all of you who are still writing letters!Ga"
"I have to say that we have taken 15 trips with OAT, 14 with Odysseys Unlimited. We are now in the big $$ hassle with OAT, but I do not envision that ever happening at all with Odysseys Unlimited. Sure, everyone has to make money, but they are so incredibly good to their clients. When things go wrong, they give you another trip.And I do not for a moment think that they would treat us the way OAT has done. We are 75, and who knows when travel will be safe again. But if we ever go anywhere, it will be with Odysseys Unlimited!"
"I have to agree that OAT seems to be the worst for taking care of its customers. Friends booked with other companies have gotten refunds without any problem. It is hard to believe that OAT doesn't have the cash to refund per its cancellation policy as it has not incurred the cost of the trips being cancelled and has money from bookings as far as two years out. I wonder if it has solvency issues -- if so, all the deferred trips and credits it is offering could prove to be worthless."
Just a footnote: my $500. Initial deposit showed up as a credit to my credit card account just today. Amazing the clout of BBB and to AG.Thanks for all of your advice.
You nailed it!!
interesting article in NY times about OAThttps:/…
Thanks for that link Davidgmg. Very interesting!
article about GCT and refunds'https://www.seattletimes.com/life/travel/grand-circle-travel-rescheduled-a-canceled-trip-without-asking-its-customer-what-about-a-refund-travel-troubleshooter/?utm_source=marketingcloud&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Evening+Brief+06-22-20_6_22_2020&utm_term=Active%20subscriber
I couldn’t open the article but googled it instead.
"Here's the link converted to a TinyUrl:https://tinyurl.com/ya4nfa6sGood story, thanks for posting it. It also mirrors the experiences here that a complaint filed with the Attorney General's office is getting results."
"I We will never travel with OAT again! All they care about is making a lot of money! There is a very arrognt attitude not caring at all about the customers. We were greatly disappointed in our last trip. The planning was geared to make you purchase the very expensive pre-trip and post trip, that were three says each, though they could easily be one day. More optional trips than any other company. They draw a lot of single people for whom we are paying the extra price for the private room. Our guide could not pronounce English t all (Japan) and we could hardly understand him (though he was trying hard to please!), In short, it was a waste of money and waste of time. When we filled out the evaluation and mentioned the problematic areas - we never heard from them. We would expect a call to find out what wnt wrong... In short- be warned! Do not join any of theit trips!"
"We heard the same stories from our friends. Maybe now, that they are all hurting, they will think more about their customers..."
I stopped traveling with them in 2015 for the reasons mentioned AND three far from expert guides in a row. While several of us provided detailed accounts of the problems encountered...there was no response from O.A.T. That in itsel was a departure from previous dealings...any mishap resulted in a call or email from the company.They have angered many long term customers who learned the hard way that loyalty doesn't matter.
"I agree a hundred percent!! Maybe now, when people are not travelling as much, they will learn a bitter lesson. They got used to people always going with them... I talked to other people who used to travel a lot, and they are keeping away from OAT.. This is not a good company!! Beware!"
"I have had two good trips with OAT, and last year gave them a $500 deposit for a trip in 2021, which they said was fully refundable. I requested a refund in March of 2020, and was assured it would be posted to my credit card in 2-4 weeks. No refund. Called back in April, May and June. Was given the run around each time. Still no refund. My friends and I will not travel with them again due to their misrepresentation of this. I am still waiting in July."
"Thanks for your report. We hope the company will realize that more and more customers are leaving them. We had one great trip, ad then we had a bad experience . We wrote twice and then called to complain and explain. Nobody was interested. They have too many returning customers and they became very arrogant. We had the worst trip possible to Japan: poor planning (every important, interesting site was offered as an ""extra"" , very over-priced). poor guide (could not pronounce English words). We will never travel with OAT. Many of our friends will never used the company because of a very bad experience and no listening ear."
"Blandgraff, did you read back to pages 44 and forward in this thread? Several people posted success stories about getting OAT refunds by filing with the MA Attorney General’s office. I’d be on the phone on Monday AM and not mess with any more waiting. Let us know how it turns out!"
"The day I did this review I also filed a complaint with BBB in Massachusetts. I received a refund today to my credit card, probably due to the BBB. Unfortunate that I had to take this step to get what was owed me."
"@Blandgraff, thanks so much for the update. So very glad you got your refund and yes, I agree, pathetic that you had to resort to contacting the BBB for OAT to issue the refund."
"The BBB has little real power. It's impact is on the damage to a company's reputation...which can be considerable.It was the dozens of furious customers who complained to the Mass. Attorney General that made the real difference. If you read through the posts you know that Mass. law REQUIRES travel companies to refund a client's money IF the travel company cancels the tour and the client requests their money back.It amazes me that after 30+ years in business, somehow O.A.T. wasn't aware. Nah!"
"OAT a is trying to get around the cancelation policy by saying they are “postponing”. We have a trip booked with them in September and they have yet to cancel/postpone. They keep sending us notices that we owe them the balance for our trip. The balance is close to $14,000. We are already out $2,400 with them. I’ll be damned if I send them another red cent."
"I have taken 5 trips with OAT and was considering a 6th. Read Harriets letter on OATs home page and based on this letter will not be booking a 6th. A lot of legalese speak carefully crafted by lawyers. Notice that the word ""refund"" is never used! Unfortunately the phrase "" buyer beware"" applies to much of the tourism industry now. Hope the company does the right thing to all of their customers who had their trip ""postponed""."
Our Morocco tour with OAT was canceled today. I called the company to request a full refund just a few minutes ago. I expected to have to argue with them but they were very gracious about it and will issue a full refund to my cc in about 30 days. I was pleasantly surprised as others have had to do battle with them. Perhaps all the bad publicity and angry customer response has had something to do with it or the MA AG a got on their case. Their response today will certainly color my decision as to whether to book with them in the future.
"Good to hear! Keep track of the days and give yourself a calendar reminder to check in 30 to make sure you've received your refund. Hopefully it will all go smoothly. Others have indicated promised refunds that did not materialize and NOT saying that is currently true, just keep track!Let us know when you get your refund! (And so sorry travel to Morocco was not possible - I'll bet you'd have had a wonderful time!)"
Thanks. I am definitely calendaring that refund. I will post back when it is received.
"So sorry your trip was cancelled. It took me over 100 days to get my deposit back, and that was with repeated calling. Hope yours comes sooner than that"
Thanks. I am hoping that OATS has learned its lesson on this. They may survive in the short term by not refunding customer money but in the long term the damage to their reputation will do them in. I thank all of those who have gone before me in pushing for a refund and putting it out there that this company was not doing what it should for its customers. I am used to much better treatment from other tour companies and am very loyal to them. This has been an eye opener and I will be more careful in the future. But this situation has been unprecedented.
"I was promised a refund for our Morocco trip by August 15. It is now a week past that date. I emailed OAT last week re: my refund and this was their reply. “I am very sorry you have yet to receive your funds in the expected time frame originally given by OAT. We have been experiencing major delays, forcing us to extend our previous agreements. Today, I forwarded your information to our finance team to track the status of your $2398.00 refund”I will be calling them Monday morning. I had hoped that they would do the right thing but apparently not."
"This is nothing new and mostly unrelated to the virus issue. I stopped using OAT years ago when they refused to refund my money after I paid but they were unable to provide business class air flights to Japan unless we agreed to accept 3 stops each way, which would have taken 2 days. Obviously there were many itineraries with only one stop, but they refused to give us those flights. Their programs and guides were mostly great and we enjoyed the several trips we took with them. But after this experience I'm done with them."
"When my refund was delayed for > 3 months, the only action I got was after contacting the BBB in Mass. Then my refund came within a week, followed by a phone call from a representative."
"Yes, I will talk to them on Monday and demand my money back. Other tour companies such as Rick Steves and Odysseys Unlimited have refunded their customers’ money. No questions asked. If they give me a hard time, I will be filing a complaint with the MA AG, BBB and sending them a 93a demand letter."
"I would tell everyone to Stay away from Trip mate. I was to have 100% coverage and they paid me only 22%. My agent said file again and i have but no response, This is deplorable in today's world. Do not use Centrav, inc. They will not pay me for my cancelled Delta flight during COVID even though Delta assures me that they have refunded the money. I am so disappointed in all parties!!!"
You should file a complaint with the insurance commissioner and Attorney General in your state.It's possible there are regulations that will help get your money back.
thanks!!!
Mass. is one of the states that have very specific consumer protection laws re: tour operators and OAT is based in Boston so that is a great suggestion.
