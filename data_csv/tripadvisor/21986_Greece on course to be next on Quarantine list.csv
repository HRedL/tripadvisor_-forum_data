"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/7-c…From what I see cases have risen to around 10 per 100k, whereas it was around 5/6 per 100k last week. Due to travel end of this week and concerned. I knew the risks so prepared for anything but will be so disappointed. Anyone travelling this week or next?"
I’m travelling in about 12 days. I can’t see it going any other way to be honest and I too will be so disappointed. I’m keeping everything crossed that the new measures implemented may start to take effect and at the very least help prevent such a rapid rise but my feeling is that it is a bit late for that now.
"Hi, going in 13 days & won’t be disappointed as I’ll be there & not here!!"
"I have travel insurance through AXA and called them before booking. They confirmed they would cover me if the travel advice changes and we can't go. Hope if it comes to it, they will not reneg. Fingers crossed though!"
"Yes unfortunately as other people have commented Greece's figures are going the wrong way. The ECDC figure at 12 noon today has Greece on 20.1, which is just above the intervention level that Shapps indicated the UK takes note. We saw a similar scenario playing out for our proposed trip to France, where once 20 was passed it seemed like we were inevitably heading towards the quarantine scenario and the FCO 'don't travel' guideline. If Greece is to avoid a similar fate it really needs its figures to drop off. Fingers crossed for everyone going to Greece or its islands."
"@5, no that's not the case. The 20.1 figure is the cumulative figure over 14 days, but the UK Govt uses the cumulative 7 day figure:""Today, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed the threshold for putting countries on the quarantine list.The Tory minister said it is 20 cases per 100,000 on a seven-day rolling average.""So where the number of cases is more or less constantly the same, the 7 day figure will be half the 14 day figureNot that this means there is any room for complacency, because the 7 day rolling average of cases has dramatically increased in the last couple of weeks, from 49 on 31/07 to 194 yesterday:https:/…This means that the 7 day figure is approximately 13. If the daily cases rise to 300, that is roughly the point where 20 will be reached.Edited: 8:46 am, August 15, 2020 "
Thanks Steve
Speculation!
"""Speculation!""I guess the people going to France and Malta thought that too."
@9 It's particularly frustrating when you live in an of Wales where the figure is 0.8 and we are going to an area in France where it's less than that! Much the same in Kef. Unfortunately our flights to Kef were cancelled by TUI so we opted for (what we thought was) the safer option in driving to France. Can't win. 4 holidays cancelled in 2020.
"Paula C : No, I have friends who went to Malta for a week & are due back tonight, so they will have to quarantine. They had no idea that this was going to happen, otherwise, they wouldn't have gone. No, so there was no indication that this would happen. As I said, it's the usual newspaper speculation!"
Why and when were they cancelled Benedict?
With the UK government it is very difficult to predict what they will do next.
Rockfarmer@12. We should have been flying out of Bristol on Thurs 3rd Sept. We were actually advised by email that our flight had been cancelled about 3 weeks ago. For weeks before that we had been alerted by social media that TUI were consolidating and only flying out on Sundays. We made numerous calls to TUI and were advised by advisors each time that no final decision on September flights had been taken. We were also advised that there would be significant additional costs if we switched to the Sunday flight. Given that our accommodation wasn't available for alternative dates we decided to abort. TUI refunded our flight costs soon after they cancelled us. We then decided to book 14 days in France - seemed a good idea at the time!
I am flying out Tuesday in British airways half empty flight by the looks of things
"Sat typing this message sat by the pool in a lovely villa not far from Agia Effima, it’s beautiful and feels very safe. Smaller numbers in the resorts as you’d expect but appropriate measures in place and we’ve got no regrets about making the trip. The number of COVID cases on the islands is tiny compared to the mainland where the majority of cases are. Putting the islands like Kefalonia on a quarantine list would be ridiculous....it’s safer here than back home by a long stretch! But there again the number of cases on the Balearics was quite small and that made no difference so who knows!"
#13That's because it's difficult to predict what Covid-19 will do next and where.Unless you have the inside track ....?
"Interesting Steve @6. Let's hope the figures go the other way, or my second attempt at kefalonia will be down the pan ..."
Sounds like heaven mark
We go on the 25th to Skala if I can fly I will go. I work from home anyway until mid September at least anyway I need a break had two days off all year Had Benidorm and Cyprus cancelled
Hi Steve - this is really useful information thanks as this is what needs to be monitored. I am wanting to go 4th September but not hopeful. The other issue is how Givernment consider GREECE - ie as one or will they have a more intelligent measure in not mass lockdown and consider islands individually
"not surprised the numbers are going up , just come back from Zante, we were watching people not wearing masks inside the hotel ,leaning over to the reception staff with no masks on ,walking where they liked in the dining room, not using the hand sanitisers and no social distancing in the bar , what more can i say,"
Sounds like England.
Will it be another last minute announcement from the UK govt? I'm absolutely stumped if it happens and we have to quarantine as I have to be back at work on 3rd Sept
"""Will it be another last minute announcement from the UK govt?""Well, they gave slightly more notice for the recent France, Malta etc quarantine than they did for Spain - but not a lot."
"Thanks Paula, I've signed up for govt email updates. Just got to keep fingers crossed it doesn't happen!"
"40yI think the issue is that our government will treat Greece as a whole so even if you're planning to go to a place that has no/few cases, a quarantine directive will apply regardless. They made no distinction between Spain, Balearics and Canaries.I hope it doesn't happen - I cancelled my Kos holiday due to depart 27/8 back in mid June - but I think the writing may be on the wall if new cases continue to rise."
Re: last minute calls.They're last minute because infection and mortality rates change on a daily basis.What amazes me is how often it's the same people who said the British government didn't react quickly enough with the original lockdown who are now complaining they're acting too quickly to take countries off the green list when there's a rise in infections.
"As the Boris family own and rent property in Greece it will remain open, with no return restrictions ;-)"
".....just hope Dominic Cummings likes to holiday in Greece too!,"
News reports this morning are no more countries going on the red list until September at least.
Iggu It does sound like England. I am tired of ducking and diving past people I am staying at home safest place in my own house
"AHLDNDo you have a link to that please?I've not watched much of the news today but haven't heard that.I can't find anything on BBC website either.I'm not sure that statement makes much sense to me.How can UK government say they won't act to put more countries on the excluded list for at least 2 weeks when they don't know what new cases may occur anywhere?This is what Rishi Sunak say on 7/8:The UK ""will not hesitate"" to add more countries to its travel quarantine list in order to protect public health, the chancellor has said.Now THAT ^^^ does make sense to me.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53691697Edited: 7:05 am, August 16, 2020 "
"I would also be interested to see a link to a valid source where that claim was made.All I've found is this so far which says ministers urge the govt but no confirmation if that will happen or not.https:/…Edited: 7:09 am, August 16, 2020 "
In the last 2 weeks Greece's cases have gone from 76 to 251 daily cases.Worrying getting higher as the disease spreads again.Not good.
#29. I agree. Until they've had their hols of course. Which is why they'll hold off til beginning of September. No use to us going mid september. I am now resigning myself to the fact that we will be going nowhere'So ironic. cos we could easily quarantine for 2 weeks but TUI have promised they wont take us anywhere where that is likely either abroad or at home.
"We're due to fly to Kalamata on 1 September for two weeks in Messenia/Laconia staying in very small places. The area has an extremely low infection rate, and I'd be safer there than in Manchester. My concern isn't so much quarantine on return as the fact that the FCO has also been issuing a travel advisory against non-essential travel to the countries that they have taken off the travel corridor."
"@38 not sure you get the point in any of this...""I'd be safer there than in Manchester""...that is great for you but as an international traveler it is you who present the risk to the Greeks no matter where they are in their country. And then upon return again present a risk to others in your area. @33 ""I am tired of ducking and diving past people I am staying at home safest place in my own house""...so agree with this statement....it is sort of like that when we try to do anything in our area.That said I certainly understand anyone trying to get a change of scenery and enjoy a holiday but it has to be done with an eye to the risk to all involved."
"We’re meant to be travelling the early hours of Tuesday morning (18th). Like everyone else planning their trip we’re on a bit of a an emotional rollercoaster right now. We booked Cephalonia because it is safe and monitoring the cases they are extremely low/negligible with no reported uk citizens bringing it onto the island. We’ve been extremely careful (bordering on obsessive!) this last few weeks to not to risk any infection. All stayed & worked at home. But Greece is currently at 18.5 rating, cases are increasing (vast majority on the mainland) and when/if that reaches that will mean the UK gov will impose the same measures as for France etc. So far the UK government has taken a one size fits all approach to countries. Personally, we’re now playing a bit of a waiting game. If it goes on the list within the next day or so we will cancel & claim what we can. I’d thought we’d just go and then self isolate in return but now realise we’d have no travel insurance, which is one risk too far for me. If it’s not on the list by the 18th we will go, and self isolate if it goes on the list when we return - right now we’re planning for that & fortunate that it’s an option. If we cancelled now, without any formal announcement, we’d lose pretty much the price of the whole holiday. Also, I’m not concerned about high Covid risks in Cephalonia, and are staying in a quiet villa near Sami. So right now I’m packing and fretting. Like a lot of people I am sure! And I will say, when we booked last month we knew there would be risks. This is on us. I’ll be gutted if we can’t go, but in the great scheme of things matters could be way, way worse. Another good source for daily monitoring the situation - number of cases, tourists versus domestic, mainland vs island: https:/…"
@40 nice to hear a very realistic approach...good luck. I think everyone is looking forward to the day in the future when we can plan and trip and not have to stress non stop and that the final packing is fun and not done in between trying to keep up with the news that might make the packing a non event.
"Hi Gene, I do get the point. Our government banning us from travel is intended to keep us safe, not the country we are travelling to, so that was why I mention safety. Perhaps I should have said ""safer going out in Greece than in Manchester"". We hardly go out at all here, and will be isolating ourselves even further for the two weeks before we are due to go. We would not want to be responsible for infecting anyone. Surprisingly, the UK has imported almost no cases to Greece as far as I know. I can see the stats, and expect to have to cancel, but until then I live in hope."
"#40....Can sympathise with how you’re feeling but perhaps to make you feel a bit better we were feeling exactly the same in the two weeks leading to our flight last Wednesday....now been here in Kefalonia for 4 days and we’re having a fantastic week and all our initial concerns seem a long distant memory. Yes it’s different in that the island is much quieter but that actually suits us, though I doubt the tourism industry in Greece would want another summer like this one, but the majority of cafes and restaurants are open with Covid measures in place in every one we’ve been to. No regrets at all about booking, weather is glorious, the scenery spectacular and cafe and restaurant owners have welcomed us with open arms. Fingers crossed you’ll be feeling the same way soon!"
Thank you Mark. Much appreciated!!
"Current infections, Wed 262, Thur 204, Fri 254, Sat 230, today 217 of which 15 at borders, most in Thessaloniki & North area of mainland"
"I go Sunday fingers crossed, im hoping if they do put it on the list we should know just before we fly. But I have read they wont put anyone else on the list till September, guess its just a waiting game.Edited: 12:12 am, August 17, 2020 "
"Courts0890. On the GS (Grant Schapps) travel bridge scale, Greece currently seems to stand at about 13.1 with 20 stated as the benchmark for pulling up the travel bridge. So unless the daily new totals in Greece are slightly over 300 per day for the next week (or Grant lowers his threshold), your flight is looking pretty good for next Sunday.Good luck with it.Steve"
#47. Any chance you can post a link to the GS scale you refer to please? TIA.
"An average of 20 new cases per 100,000 of population based on the rolling 7 day average of positive results.NB There is a similar 14 day rolling average published daily on another web page, but those results are obviously different. He specifically said 7.I don't have the link. But he was on the telly last weekend after they downgraded France who were at just over 20 and the Netherlands, who were more like 24 at the time.His quote was also in at least one of the daily papers at the time and somebody I think posted a link near the beginning of this or another thread in the last week.For reference, I think the UK are currently about 11.4(ish).."
"""But I have read they wont put anyone else on the list till September, guess its just a waiting game.""Have you read this as a definite?Someone posted this on another thread:""News reports this morning are no more countries going on the red list until September at least.""Turns out that this is behind that comment:""Boris Johnson is being urged not to add any more countries to the quarantine list in order to save what is left of the summer holidays"".Not a 'done deal' at all."
"thetotalpackage you're quite correct. If anyone is interested (and has lots of time on their hands) and wants to work out the figure here's a link that can be used to see what the 7 day rate per 100,000 is : https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus  If you click on an individual country you need to scroll down to the table for Daily New cases and add up the last 7 days. That sum is then divided by the quotient number for that country (based on population). For the UK it is 679 (67.9million) and Greece 104 (10.4m). For info currently Greece is on 13.96 and UK 11.28. The figures often quoted on TV are 14 day rolling figures and for comparison can be found at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en on Daily Situation Updates."
I’m due to go this Thursday for 12 nights. I’m a teacher so cannot risk having to quarantine. I just don’t know what to do. It’s actually making me ill. So are you saying cases have to be above 300 per day consistently for 2 weeks to reach the 20 marker for the rolling average
"Benedict - I am that geek with too much working from home time on my hands. For info, I rounded the population to 11m to err on the side of caution and on that link you posted, there is a little show 7 day rolling average button which helps.Mrs FMy schoolboy maths makes it around 315 per day for 7 consecutive days to breach the 20.The number of tests done and hence the number of new +ves might go up dramatically or the Govt might reduce the number from 20. It is all a bit of a guesstimateI've just seen a news alert saying that Croatia might be next (newspaper speculation) They are currently at just over 24 on the GS scale. That's were the Netherlands were last Friday. Let's see."
"Mrs F. It appears that the UK government is using a 7 day period for analysis. So the average 300 figure for 7 days would give 2100 cases. That would then give Greece a figure just over 20. That's how they are working apparently. I really hope for your sake that figures start coming down. We're hoping the same for France where unfortunately their rate has increased significantly recently, pushing them well over 20. Best of luck and fingers crossed."
"Hi all, 150 infections today"
Thanks to several people on this thread for trying to explain how the Govt in the UK bases it's quarantine process.It is useful to know. Does anyone have any idea on what France's number was before they were put back on the list?
#55 Where did you get that info from please?
Nigel it is on Worldometers that the number is 147
"Hi, Kefalonia Pulse report Govt figure of 150 infections inc 17 detected at borders"
https:/…Good link this page is
"#58 Ah yes I can see now, down the bottom part of the Worldometers page. I was looking at the graph section! So using 147, I calculate the 7 day number to be 13.8, up from 13.6 yesterday but its a positive sign that today's new case number is significantly lower than yesterday's"
We are supposed to be going to kefalonia on Saturday. I hope I still am.

Basically Haris Theocharis, Greek Minister for Tourism has been asked to intervene regarding ‘misinformation’ in the British media claiming Greece is to be added to the UK quarantine list.They also point out that the British media has based their claim on incorrect calculations.

"Hi Rockfarmer, fiscardofan posted that earlier"
Ah yes sorry
I’m in the same position-supposed to be heading out on Sunday. I have had to inform my Headteacher as I needed to know my position with regard quarantine if it is brought in. I have offered to work at home unpaid.
"With infections decreasing for the last 3 days I don’t think those travelling in the next few days have anything to worry about. As I’ve described in other threads, our journey over here was excellent and as we move into our last couple of days I think my family would all agree that we’ve had one of our best holidays yet. Relax and enjoy. Kefalonia is much quieter but still as beautiful as ever."
"KatomeriKafFrance was taken off the airbridge list when they reached about 20.5 and the Netherlands were also removed on the same day when they reached about 24.1.Greece, as of this morning is around 13.4 and weekend test results have been trending slightly down."
thanks thetotalpackage.Good to have a few figures!
"Hi, 269 infections, 39 at borders reported today"
"These headlines are having a real impact here. We are staying in Corfu at Stefano's apartments Barbati, and yesterday they had four UK bookings cancel for next week, this is nearly a third of their reservations. The reality is that Stefano's have implemented excellent covid measures, are as friendly and warm as ever and provide wonderful hospitality and food.We are living in strange times and no one knows what will happen next, but from our experience, it is as safe or safer here than the UK.On the easyJet flight, the flight attendants were great at asking people to put on our pull up their masks. We came on the 16th, and to be quite frank, we nearly pulled out at the last moment, I'm so glad we didn't. The reality is this may be our last holiday abroad for a while; who knows how long this will go on, who knows which airlines / holiday companies will survive. Take sensible precautions, go while you can, and have a great holiday!"
250 cases today7 day average now 20.39 per 100k which is over threshold :(
"> 7 day average now 20.39 per 100k which is over threshold :(How are you calculating this? Every other figure I've seen today has the rate between 13 - 14 per 100k. Please don't scare people if aren't sure of your calculations, or at least provide a source or how you got this value."
#75 - I don't think that is correct........think the figure is like Will says or close to. I make it 14.9 after todays case number.......that's for a 7 day ave case number of 222.
"yes, seem the figure I saw is wronggood to see :) (well better than it might be )"
"I'm confused about how you are getting your figures? everyone keeps telling you its around 14/15 with the 7-day average. but you are going on different threads saying it's over 20, with a sad face. I'm confused. whos wrong ? whos right ?"
#77 Based on a number today of 250 and a population of 10.423M I get the number per 100K to be 14.7
know what i mean. the panic is real
#80 - well I was going by the 7 day average including the 269 case number today......from the Greek Ministry of Health body EODY. Anyway......0.2 difference ! Really ?!https://kefaloniapulse.homeinkefalonia.prope…
@ Matthew vIt really doesn't matter what precautions a specific accommodation in a resort on an island takes.The UK Government won't take that into consideration.They will treat Greece as a country.
"#82 Ha ha, I wasn't trying to correct you, just trying to show that I pretty much concurred with your view! :)"
"#84 - sorry, Nigel....no problem !"
"Last three days amount of new diagnosed cases goes down in Greece. However, it's impossible to predict what will happen in following days."
"Hi all, just to add to the calculations between 1-16 Aug 2,592,853 entered the country, 2,068,408 by air, 140,051 via ports & 384,394 at land borders. If these 319,379 were tested & 615 tested positive, 364 at airports, 17 at ports, 234 at land borders. The top five countries whose citizens tested positiveRomania 88Bulgaria 86Serbia 80Albania 63Sweden 29Would be interesting to see haw many from UK. It is estimated that the population during holiday period is nearly 12m on a rolling basis"
And no surprises... The below countries are still on the UKs non-airbridge list.Dare I say that perhaps the Govt are handling the ongoing issues better than they handled the first wave.
"217 infections today, 16 at borders"
"#87 - good info that. So, roughly about 12% being tested of those entering the country - and then about 0.19% of those being positive. That's a fairly low level, if it stays like that."
"Hi, there are 3 confirmed cases in Lixouri, isolation & Track & Trace are taking place."
"Hi Manilow, very much doubt it, 7 day infection rate slightly down & has to be over 20 for 7days to activate FCO advice."
"Hi,Sorry I’m new to this forum and there are a lot of messages. Can someone let me know what the rolling 7 day figure is per 100,000 in Greece right now? Is it on the downturn or still increasing and are people expecting them to be removed from the travel corridor?"
https:/…
"It's about 13. The last few days the increase has stopped. For it to get above 20, the country would have to record an average of 300 cases a day over the 7 days. Currently the 7 day average number of new cases is 215.https:/…"
"#94 - the 7 day average per 100k is about 14.7 right now I think. Greece has been getting around 220 new cases on average for about the last 10 days - but, it's difficult to predict whether it will increase sharply in coming days and weeks. The Greek govt have brought in some stricter measures aimed at more local spikes - so at the moment, it's hard to say whether Greece will be removed from the exempt list."
"It’s currently 14.6 I believe, if today’s figures are less than 204 will fall further."
"Sorry, I slightly underestimated the figure in 96. It is roughly 14.5 depending on whose population figure you take."
Has anyone kept track of how quickly it appears to be increasing? For instance doubling per week?
@Kate T it’s hard to tell at the moment as it is currently falling since last week. It should be more clear by the end of the week.
Greece is very very unlikely to be added to the list this week. The best advice I can give is to avoid reading UK media who are deliberately scare mongering to get clicks on their websites.
"Kate. Nowhere near doubling. In percentage terms, probably up less than 20% in the last week and there was even a slight downward blip yesterday. But nobody can really predict."
"Kate, the graph is here. Click on 7 day average and you can see the historical data. There was a time a couple of weeks ago when it was doubling by the week, but thankfully that is no longer the case - though it hasn't completely flattened yet by any means: https:/…"
Scheduled to fly out Sep 1st... looks like it might be a close call by then. Fingers crossed!!
Hi!I know that a lot of you are worried about the number of infectious cases in Greece; will Boris impose a quarantine?It's out of your hands - there's nothing that you can do that has any effect on the rate of infections.Hold your nerve and WAIT!
Does anyone know if the figure of 20 cases per 100000 has to be reached on just one day of the rolling 7 day average - or for a sustained period of time? Thanks
It's 20 over the rolling average period of 7 days. One day's figure is not an average.
"So - 209 new cases reported today......which is down from yesterday, but it seems to be fluctuating day by day. Still, it means infection rate is slightly reduced to 15 per 100k. Let's hope it goes down further tomorrow.https://kefaloniapulse.homeinkefalonia.prope…"
"@RockyQ even better, it has fallen to 14.1 per 100k for 7 day rolling average"
"#110 - I make it 15.0......but, not gonna quibble about 0.9 !"
I think it depends on what population figure you use.
"#111 I have 14.49 based on 10.4M population or 14.05 based on 10.7M.I have been tracking how each day's number varies from the same day 7 days earlier. So over the last week the AVERAGE change in numbers is +16%. So by my prediction Saturday's number will be 257. Having said this, that number looks high, and so I feel confident my 16% growth is high. But even on that conservative estimate, my model doesn't show the new infections per 100K population rolling 7 day number hitting 20 until 9th September. I suspect with the end of the traditional summer season as August fades to September and the Greeks going back to school then my 16% growth could well flatten to 0 or even go negative.All this might be pants, but in summary, I don't see the 20 number being hit anytime soon such that quarantine on return to the UK is implemented"
Which is currently approx 11.6m
Can’t make my mind up on whether to book Greece or Turkey for next week. Anyone have any opinions (impossible to fully predict) on which is likely to stay off the list longer?
Greece’s av pop is 10.8 in summer it’s currently 11.6
"Worldometer has Greece population at 10,415.735."
The circle closes slowly... Previous tourists (after persistent insistence and whining to let them enter the GR) brought the virus to Greece ... the next ones return it from Greece back home.
"I’m in Crete on holiday with my family and whilst everyone is debating infection figures on this thread, we are all busy having a wonderful time in glorious weather. The Greeks are so clean, cleaner than the Brits, if you are coming here, be excited, you’ll have an amazing time."
Today was down on last Friday wasn’t it . Ideally tomorrow will be less than 226
"Hi Ntragkon,Post #118 - you have an interesting point of view but you may find that the statistics paint a contradictory picture."
I highly recommend following @BenkersBen on Twitter. He gives an unbiased view on the figures and how they'll impact the quarantine list. He's been spot on so far. Avoid UK newspapers whose sole aim is to get you clicking on their links scaring folk everywhere will be put on the list.
Greece has far fewer cases and deaths per capita than the UK. And Greece has handled this much better from the beginning.
"""Greece has far fewer cases and deaths per capitathan the UK.""And so has Croatia.But that didn't stop the UK government from imposing 14 days quarantine for people returning from Croatia.It's not about the # of deaths per capita.The thread is about the possibility of the UK doing the same for Greece as they did for Croatia, Spain etc (which I personally don't think is likely in the near future if the # of new cases stay around the same per day)."

"Bigcol my “argument” is that I agree with you. There should be quarantines for countries with high rates, like the UK. Not for countries like Greece."
"""Bigcol my “argument” is that I agree with you. There should be quarantines for countries with high rates, like the UK. Not for countries like Greece.""But each country's government makes its own rules on which country they feel presents a risk - either from people visiting their country or returning from another country.It's not up to random strangers on t'interweb to decide that.The government of Greece has all the data they require to decide which country's citizens can enter their country.And they have decided that UK citizens can enter."
UK is 10.5 per 100k for 7 day average. One of the lowest in Europe at the moment.
"170 new cases today, that should bring the 7 day average down a little."
It’s 155
"#136 Today's number is 155 now per Worldometers. Agree it is less than yesterday, but you have to compare today's number with last Monday's. As we are looking at a 7 day rolling average, last Monday's number in the calculation is replaced by today's. So last Monday was 147 which means at 155 the rolling average moves up ever so slightly"

"It’s 170, that worldometers is always wrong then updates a few days later"
"Initially reported as 170, but revised downwards to 155 - pasted from Worldometer Greece page:. ""Updates155 new cases in Greece. The total number of confirmed cases has been revised by the Government after checking the data. The figure of 8819 confirmed cases reflects this. [source]""Monday's figures are often the lowest number of the week, and as already stated the rolling 7 day figure has gone up slightly."
@thisisthe1 Worldometers is spot on. All of us doing the rolling averages can vouch for that. I recheck all the numbers from the past week everytime I do it and can confirm they are not updated to a new number
"Stop stressing people;. If HM Government suddenly impose a 14 day quarantine on people returning from Greece there's nothing that you can do about it - and it will be sudden with no warning if recent experience is repeated. If you think it could happen what are you going to do? Cancel and lose all that you have paid? Go with the flow, relax and enjoy and if you have to stay home for 14 days on your return so be it. Support our wonderful Greek friends and their economy."
"#143 - I agree, if you are already there, not a lot you can do if UK govt take Greece off the exempted list should infections rise further above the 20/100k threshold., and you have to do 14 day quarantine on return. But, if you are going in the next few weeks and the govt takes Greece off list of exemptions before you travel and you decide to travel anyway - then travel insurance is invalid......not a good situation to be in while travelling and for the duration of a 14 day holiday, say."
"Totally disagree. I am here in Greece and have been since 16 Aug. I'm watching the figures daily because there most definitely IS ""something I can do"" if quarantine for Greece is announced - I can book flights home to beat the quarantine deadline."
"Re 144. This might ruffle a few feathers on here, but here's a different perspective.It's all about risk aversion. The FCO provides advice against travelling for non essential purposes. It is not a legal requirement to accept that advice.Similarly, taking out travel insurance is highly advisable, but neither compulsory nor a legal requirement, as it is with, say, car insurance. The thousands of British tourists who are still flying out to Croatia may be seen as reckless by some but as having low risk aversion levels by others. There is no right or wrong here. People will make their own individual risk assessments of the situation and decide whether to travel or not, whatever the quarantine status and FCO advice. Many people decided that they wouldn't get on a plane with hundreds of other people during the Covid era. Others were concerned that they'd be the ones who'd be tested and perhaps quarantined for the duration of their holiday. The comfort zones of all of us differ widely. It's up to individuals to make their own judgment calls about travelling in this current climate."
I would agree with that.Plus some of us have already had covid19 and recovered. This makes our attitude to risk different from those who are afraid of catching it or testing positive.
"There is now an insurance company that will cover travel for countries that are on the FCO quarantine list due to COVID. They will cover everything, including issues due to quarantine, except for Covid health treatment. That would be covered by the EHIC card and the Greek government has committed to treat any tourist with Covid. Hopefully other insurance companies will follow."
Hi what is the insurance company mentioned below which covers travel against fco advice please?
"#148 - interesting, but who are they ? No, don't answer that......no advertising here ! Anyway, I have an annual policy which has already been renewed.......but, they've said we wouldn't be covered if FCO advice changes for Greece to non-essential travel only. Not travelling without insurance."
"#143Quite the right attitude, without ""philosophizing"" and affectation. Only no one should confuse personal pleasures (vacations e.g.) with philanthropy."
"#150. There’s nothing wrong at all in answering a poster’s specific question re insurance companies. However, what would be wrong is self-promotion or obvious opportunism. This is a travel forum so any advice or tips from fellow travellers are the very things it exists for.Edited: 3:13 pm, August 24, 2020 "
Just type into google “insurance cover for Covid” and it will come up. I have no knowledge of the company - it was in a newspaper that they were now doing it.
"My understanding of insurers such as Battleface is that they will provide cover if the FCO advice is only essential travel and they will provide medical cover if you get ill with covid on holiday. What they do not provide , and I do not think any insurer will provide, is insurance that will cover the cost of your holiday if the flight and hotel get cancelled due to borders closing or other covid related situations. For that you have to rely on what the airline does and what your cancellation terms are with the hotel. But they will cover for lost bags, theft etc."

Thanks thisisthe1 - really useful info!
"Can someone please remind me.. to be on the red list does greece have to be over 300 new cases for a total of 7 days to push the average to over 20 per 100,000. Sound right? Due to travel Sunday and want to check. Thanks in advance."
"#156. Thank you Thisisthe1. Thats the basic info we need. I realise cases per day in each area are important, but for those of us ( hopefully ) travelling in the next few weeks, the daily figures you give are vital. Keep it up please :-)"
"Daily figures today: 168 cases in Greece as a whole. Looks like it won't be put on the quarantine list for this week, at least."
No it shouldn't!168 was yesterday's figure.
"I would hope so too, otherwise someone has a time machine! (I meant todays updated figure from yesterday - oops!)"
Lewis it's a shame that we hadn't all got our hands on a crystal ball early this year!
"Compared to other countries who are orange or red here, the numbers are really low. Makes me thing Greece will be safe to trafel in september, without having to worry about a lockdown or set to orange/red. Anyone else thinks the same?We are planning to go on 4th (havent booked yet)"
"Kate T, yes that's correct"
"Oh dear - new cases up to 293 today......that's a big jump from 168 yesterday. 7 day ave / 100k I make 15.9 now, using EODY figures. Greek govt now introducing free Covid-19 tests at Piraeus for ferry travellers to the popular islands, as a means to identify infections and control the spread."
14.9
"You need to use the Greek Health Ministry (EODY) figures for accuracy, not Worldometer."
293 today(a high) replaces 212 from last week so slight increase on 7day av
And a worrying highest daily figure so far.Let's hope it's a one-off and tomorrow will see a big drop to below 250 (20th August figure).
Hope it goes down again. I go 22nd September. So desperate for a holiday.
@RockyQ look at the reference for the number on the worldometer site. It is EODY
EODY figures are the ones I'm quoting
"@RockyQ without understanding them. The worldometer one is the adjusted number not the raw one. The total cases have to tally and if you use the raw unadjusted one then they don’t. The 7 day rolling average per 100k is 14.9Edited: 1:19 pm, August 26, 2020 "
Both Worldometers and EODY numbers match today
"@Nigel B yes they do today as there was no adjustments needed. (Worldometer use EODY as well)Edited: 1:28 pm, August 26, 2020 "
#174 - there's no need to be insulting.......I do fully understand them.
@RockyQ There is nothing personal. Just need to make sure the numbers are correct otherwise the wrong 7 day rolling average per 100k being posted gets confusing.
"Bit of tension creeping in here! Keep it cool Trig, keep it cool!"
This site tends to update before the normal daily report. However the totals are not deduped so you need to look at the graph for total cases and subtract yesterdays total form todays to get the correct figurehttps:/…
14.9 is the figure after today.No need for handbags.
250204243283155168293Divided by 104.2 based on the population on the 20th August 2020 = 15.32
Me and my partner due to fly out on the 11th. many thanks to all you posting the updates on here. im fairly confident we will make it as long as boris keeps calm. first time in kefalonia like many others desparate for a break after working flat out since end of feb for nhs. Thanks again for the updates folks.
"The current population is 10,730,000 + approx 600,000 in seasonal uplift"
Lets hope they are using the NSSG figures rather than the UN ones - 14.87 sound much better than 15.31!
We are supposed to be going out on Sunday for a week... thoughts?
"14.9 is the figure right now with an average daily number of 200 over the last 3 days. With basic maths you could work out what the daily figure needs to jump to before your departure date to trigger quarantine... IF the govt stuck to their current decision-making criteria.Edited: 3:38 pm, August 26, 2020 "
I'm going on Saturday - so unless it is over 415 for each of the next 3 days then I 'm good to go.. In fact since my flight is at 6am then it needs to be 500 for each of the next two days to end the corridor - and there isn't much chance of that!
"@Nav-Rich They do the review tomorrow so the set of 7 days numbers from last Thursday until today is considered. Next Thursday will be the same and will be considering the numbers from tomorrow until next Wednesday.Edited: 4:21 pm, August 26, 2020 "
"Hi! Don't forget that the UK government are looking for a period of 7 days during which the seven-day rolling average is above 20. The quarantine should not be imposed if one ""rogue"" result is above 20."
Figures need to avaerage 2200 for it to be over quarantine ( in 7 days) So average around 300 per day It’s creeping up that way if you exclude weekends already
"I’m keeping an eye on the figures but mainly for Kefalonia. As there is now insurance cover available for travel to countries on the FCO essential-travel-only list, for me it is a matter of will I feel safe if I go on my holiday to Kefalonia? The answer is yes as there have been no reported cases there for a few days. Would I go to Athens - probably not. The only concern I have is that EasyJet will cancel the flight"
".Edited: 3:09 am, August 27, 2020 "
How did you find out the cases for individual areas? Thanks in advance
Anybody know what the current rate is?Seeing different numbers Under 20 is still regarded as green is that correct
14.9 I believe
·Do any of you clever so and sos good at maths know what the numbers would have to be between now and next Thursday to hit the 20 pls ?
Thanks
"On tenterhooks, maybe cut off at the pass, for the 13th then"
I personally don't see Greece being caught by the quarantine rule at all this season although what happened with Jamaica (how fast things changed) shouldn't be ignored. But Greece has been pretty steady at 200 per day (ish) and they'd have to get to 300+ to trigger quarantine. Something big would have to happen - a major change in the pattern - and I just can't see it happening.
There's time for the midnight closures to have an effect on the infection rate. Also time for the Govt to decide that testing instead of quarantine is ok. Fingers crossed
Hope it doesnt change on the 10th we fly 6.20 am on the 11th !!!
Yes I do get that ... although even the simplest of maths isn’t my forte . Are we saying it would take a lot to be cut off next week then
"Hi ephraimbacup,Even if the 7 day average per 100,000 creeps above 20 it has to stay above 20 for seven days before the UK government impose quarantine restrictions.You have at least 7 days, probably more as the rate is not at 20 yet."
Ah ok so it would have to be 20 from now til next Friday . No problem thanks
"@ephraimbacup It needs to have a 7 day rolling average per 100k of at least 20. This is approximately an average daily infection rate of 305. It could have days below this and days above this, it is the average that counts."
#206. I sympathise Julie M. We're due to fly on Thursday 17th at 16.45!!!!! I have visions of getting one foot on the plane steps and then hearing a shout of 'everybody off':-)
Fingers crossed for you maggie m. Im optomistic based on no scientific knowledge at all just my gut feeling we will all be fine.
I'm happy to go along with that sentiment Julie!
"Thanks twinkletoes. I know gut feelings are not very scientific but after nearly 6 months of 'are we' arn't we', my nerves are shot so its nice to hear some optimism even if it comes to nothing in the end:-))"
"Bigcol that's not true - the 7 days refers to the average over 7 days .  The countries added yesterday did not have values over 20 for 7 days but their 7 day average was over 20. France came off list when it hit 20 the day before. Greece cases have been rising so its likely to come off next week if cases stay above 300Edited: 6:04 am, August 28, 2020 "
Czech only surpased 20 on the day of the review and it was removed from exemption list that day
#216 Dont get ahead of yourself Martha. Greece havent reached 300 a day. Yet. :-))
"""Greece cases have been rising so its likely to come off next week if cases stay above 300""The number of daily cases for Greece has never hit 300.The highest ever was 293 on 26/8 but it dropped yesterday to 251.However, as you say, the number has been rising since the first few days of August.But I wouldn't go as far as predicting that Greece will be removed from the exempt list next week.It's all about the numbers and nobody knows what they will be until announced."
Watching avidly the numbers coming from Greece.....off to Katelios 9th with a fair wind and crossed fingers!!
Martha X - that's not true. Greece had never yet seen 300 in a day. Please check facts before posting.
"Now August is nearly over and the Greek and Italians have returned to their homes the beaches are returning to a pleasant space to be, the roads are less gridlocked and I think the numbers will fall slowly but surely. Not a fact, merely an observation."
"So greece now in Amber zone, 15.5, despite low cases today - 177, don't know how that happened. But we can still travel so far."
There do appear to be signs that the number of cases is plateauing. Take a look at the daily new cases graph here and click on the 7 day moving average: https:/…The figure has gone down today (the graph is one day behind) and it was just over 16 yesterday.
"Not suprised really measures here are much tighter than at home, even think about entering a shop without a mask & your challenged(not me by the way, tho seen it twice 2day) All staff in tavernas have to wear mask/visor, fines are handed out if not"
"We went to the beach today. No signs of social distancing, waiters not wearing a mask, no sun beds disinfected after people vacating so we left. I think the Greeks are getting fed up of the whole situation and relaxing the rules."
"#226. That’s bad news, especially at the moment. Yes, vote with your feet. I think that’s the best way to try and protect yourselves. Am surprised and disappointed to hear this though, I thought Cephalonia would be one of the stricter islands. Let’s hope the majority of resorts are complying."
"We arrived last night, masks were being worn in the shops, and in the restaurant we ate at, will let you know about the beach later. The airport was a breeze, didn’t see anyone from our flight tested. Everywhere was spotless."
"Beaches have lots of UV, which kills all viruses in 15 minutes. It's possible to get infected on a beach, but for that one must be having a very close contact with a sick person. Closed spaces with not enough ventilation are those, where the most contractions happen.Edited: 1:17 am, August 30, 2020 "
"I appreciate that it's sort of the wrong forum, and I don't suppose anybody has been watching too closely, but Portugal look to be much more on course to go back on the Quarantine list this week than Greece in the next few weeks.And for what it's worth, we are just coming to the end of our lovely 2 weeks on the island and I would agree that in general, the shops and cafes are complying and enforcing the rules and the Greek Government do seem to be reacting and making changes where it is deemed necessary. They controlled it really well the first time around and now seem to be doing a good job of continuing that for the good of their people, the tourists and their economy. Not easy to do."
Agree with #229. You have to be reasonable. People will touch the sand but you can't very well disinfect the actual beach can you?
"@thisisthe1 It must vary across the UK. I found Greece (until requiring masks outside) to be much more lax with requirements. Social distancing is not closely followed, hand sanitising on entering a restaurant not enforced, masks being worn in shops still with the nose out and tables at restaurants are often preset rather than setting once people arrive. I’ve been in close proximity of much more people in Greece than I have back home."
"I’ve only seen this happen once ...Placing a towel on top of sun loungers is mandatory and considered the responsibility of the user. The staff at organized beaches and beach clubs are required to disinfect sun loungers/chairs after every use. Additionally, they must regularly disinfect sanitary facilities and post a schedule of that cleaning for official review."
"Having spent the last 2 weeks in Greece I'd say people here are no more and no less ""strict"" than people across England. No difference at all."
Someone put a link on here for someone on Twitter that had updates. But I can’t find it. Does anyone know it? Thanks in advance
benkersben and there is one called paul charles. Sorry not got exact links but you should find them!
Apparently Greece is out the amber zone and back in green due to last nights figures. Starting to feel slightly obsessed with the cases. Although don’t think I’m the only one
You certainly are not . I’m going mad . Travel Friday
"Gulp, should we hold off from counting the chickens for a mo?https:/…uk-wales-53966897"
157 today
I am still obsessed and I am flying on Tuesday this week. I won't believe I am going until I am on Greek soil with an ice cold frappe in my hand. Good luck everyone! I hope for the sake of the people of Greece that cases come down.
1175 here in UK today
"#244 - no, it's actually 1715, which is highest daily figure since the end of May."
"#245Yes, sorry I entered the numbers in the wrong order. Worrying."
At what point has Greece imposed measures such as negative Covid tests for countries such as Begium etc?
"As UK daily cases go up, UK might change safety country level from 20 to higher. At least this would be logical move, despite we didn't see too much logic in handling coronavirus pandemic in many countries. Today UK had 22.97 14 days average, Greece 29.08 and Cyprus 17.24."
It amuses me to read about the quarantine measures which have been brought back in UK when numbers there are high anyway.
"Non of this amuses most people but although the U K doesn't have the lowest rate of new Covid cases, it has a lower new daily rate per population than many other countries, hence the new quarantines.Shame it didn't have the same system in March!"
"We have just returned from Rhodes, and felt more safe there then in the UK! Staff at the hotel we stayed (Atrium Palace - fab hotel) wore masks all the time, tables were spaced, saw sun beds being cleaned down, the floors were mopped all the time, they took CoVid measures very, very seriously, same we found when we went out, taxi drivers always wore masks, same in the shops. Over here you go on the bus no-one is wearing masks, even in shops and Banks, staff tell people you have to wear them but can't force as you don't know if you will get a fist in your face!"
