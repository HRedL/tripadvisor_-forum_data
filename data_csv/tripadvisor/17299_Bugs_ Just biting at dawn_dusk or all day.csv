A few people have posted about being bitten by bugs. This doesn't surprise me as there are mosquito's and other such bugs everywhere. Does any one know if the bugs are just biting at dawn and dusk or is it an all day thing.I will be bringing some bug juice either way.
"Mostly in the morning , evening, and overnight hours. On a cloudy and rainy day the mosquitos can be out, especially if your around lots of plants and such. They get me at night when sleeping, always that lone one that buzzes my ear."
The specie of mosquito that caused the Dengue Fever epidemic last summer in the Bahamas bites in the daytime. It would be hard to see one coming in broad daylight.
"Tiger is right about the mosquito species that was responsible for last years Dengue outbreak. But most of the confirmed cases were persons living in urban areas where standing water was present. Old tires, unmaintained yards, etc. And trust me we have a big problem with those issues. But not at the resort areas. Still a good idea to apply repellant during the early morning hours and in the evening, as well as during the day with the sunscreen. You can't be too careful."
