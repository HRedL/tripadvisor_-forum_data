"hi steve,thanks for the information, even in Italy there are almost the same measures, I hope to come to Greece in August with my car in a brindisi ferry, hopefully good for everyone."
Well good luck with this bold plan
>> I hope to come to Greece in August with my car in a brindisi ferry<<You hope it. I doubt it very much.
We're due to fly on July 5th so fingers crossed.Interesting to note that TUI's website were still offering holidays to Parga for July 5th about ten minutes ago ?????YamasDave.
"Well yes, if TUI get paid for a July holiday they get cash which they very much need. Yes, they will quite likely need to deal with the July holiday later, they are hoping by a rebooking or voucher, but it’s all cash flow keeping them afloat. A big benefit for them is that when restrictions are lifted country by country they already have the bookings in place and can start sending travellers immediately.Edited: 9:24 am, April 30, 2020 "
"Travel companies don't seem to take into account government measures , as if I wanted to I could book a holiday to Parga early June, when we'll still be under some measure of lockdown, & wouldn't happen, but travel company still happy to take my money!"
"It's a deplorable practise from the airline, and really shouldn't be happening. They have no reason to believe that they will be able to honour the contracts, and every reasonable to believe that they will not be able to honour the contracts. They should not be selling."
"We're going to Parga in 2021 so a credit note of sorts would be OK for us but if people want a full refund they're entitled to one by law but several companies are dragging their heels with cash refunds. The Government should step in and threaten to suspend their licenses !!However, before demanding your money back remember that TUI for example are offering what they're calling a 20%""incentive"" to take the credit note so let's say your 2020 holiday cost £1800.00 then you can book a 2021 holiday up to the value of £2160.00 at no extra cost."
"Silver-Fox-Two ,be careful of the voucher or credit note.It will make you and unsecured creditor. I already reading that airlines are running to their governments trying to get them to legislate so they dont have to refund you .Edited: 9:53 am, April 30, 2020 "
Silver-Fox-Two TUI are offering a 20% incentive to transfer the holiday. We recently changed our holiday to Crete in June and the same hotel and dates for next year was £500 more. We shortlisted a few others on the website and chose one at a similar price to what we have paid. That was 3 weeks ago. I checked the shortlist yesterday and one holiday in Corfu had increased by £350. I think prices will be a lot higher in future so not much to be gained from a 20%incentive.
"The ""all in"" cost of our our 2020 holiday is £1517.76 so using TUI's 20% Incentive deal (if it gets cancelled) we could re-book a holiday later this year up to £1821.31 at no extra cost. We're lucky in that my Wife already has two weeks booked off at work in late August so as I said the Credit Note system would work for us but under UK Law others should be able to get full hassle-free cash refunds within seven days. If the TO's refuse or delay payments the government should step in. The CEO of Ryanair has just said on BBC News that it could take them up to six months to action all the refunds !!For info we've already booked our 2021 holiday at the same studios in Parga for £1695 (an approx 11.5% increase)"
"Tui have just cancelled our hol for first week of June. The same hotel, same week, next year is 35% more expensive. Plus our cancellation email says 'up to 20%'. We are just waiting for some code to arrive but I think we'll fight for a refund. I'm sure tui will work their magic and fleece us either way.Edited: 6:34 am, May 01, 2020 "
"Hi all, May10th as said in other posts was cancelled. OK. Heard nothing from TUI so rang them, eventually got through and was told I needed to wait for a voucher code. So, went onto a TUI Facebook page, explained the situation that ok, May cancelled but we also have September 2020 booked and May and September 2021 with TUI can we just move the money. I even quoted the booking references. I got a reply saying that my post had been removed - lol. I understand things are difficult at the moment but apparently we have to wait about 30 days after our original departure date before we get the voucher so that will be in June - if we are lucky."
Where were you staying Kazzy ?
"Satriani100 I read last week (sorry can't remember where) that TUI will let you use the vouchers to pay off a future holiday which is already booked. Hopefully you will be able to do this.Edited: 7:00 am, May 01, 2020 "
"This is from TUI's website ;- If you’re unable to accept a refund credit you can apply for a refund; due to the volume of holidays impacted, we’re asking you not to contact us until you receive your refund credit so we can continue helping customers in date order. However, if you do need to request your refund before this you can do so using the details below. Please be aware that our call centre teams are incredibly busy, so call waiting times are considerably longer than usual. You can call 0203 451 2868 between 9am and 7pm from Monday to Friday."
More Coronavirus info here https:/…coronavirus
you are unlikely to get the holiday you booked this year for the same price next and you will eventually pay more along with a higher insurance which will not included the virus as cover. Also there is unlikely to be an EHIC card for UK people. So a nasty bill if it is still round and you catch it on holiday
"The EH1C scheme ends when the UK leaves the EU (on Dec 31st ?) so it's even more imperative now that people get adequate insurance for 2021 onwards. (don't know why it's not compulsory) I found a cheap one at just over £30 for this year's holiday but when I checked the small print it had £100 excess on every category so I searched Google for ""Excess free insurance"" and got a beauty for £78.00. It's a ""single trip"" policy but cover actually started the day I paid the premium.YamasDave"
"Maybe it would be prudent not to book any flights or holidays for next year and seek a full refund rather than accept vouchers, I say this as the covid19 virus is an unknown entity and no body knows if and when it will dissipate or when a vaccine will be available! There is great uncertainty as to whether or not travel companies or airlines will survive the economic crisis and how holiday destinations will accept tourists in the future. Globally there appears to be no standardisation in place for how travellers are screened in airports or other places. Also how can we be certain that travellers/tourists are free of the virus or are not carriers or whether there will be a resurgence at any time! I am looking for a refund from BA as I have only booked flights for mid June but like others will have to wait for them to cancel the flight and then wait for however long it takes for the refund to appear."
The CEO of Ryanair was on BBC TV this morning and he assured the Interviewer that they would issue refunds to 100% of applicants but due to the massive number of claims it might take them up to six months to get through them all. OUCH !!
"I should have been on the Manchester flight this Sunday 3rd May - sadly won't be. TUI emailed me on 8th April to say cancelled and would be contacted - received a phone call on 21st April, offering (a) re-book up to 120% of cost of current hol, (b) have a refund voucher of 120% of current hol (c) refund - asked for refund and money back in my account the next day - wasn't expecting that.Got another 2 weeks booked on 20th September, going to watch and wait to see what happens"
"Does anyone else find it funny when a positive post in a forum dedicated to a place in Greece where many depend upon tourism for their sole income, turns into a debate about vouchers or refunds ?UK problems eh ?"
"I find it sad Steve to be honest. We'll all get something back for the holidays cancelled but the Greek businesses get nothing....? Or does the contracts with the package operators mean some money has to be paid for empty rooms at accommodation? But that is of no help to independent accommodation, restaurants, bars, boat trips, supermarkets, .... the list goes on and on.I just hope the tourist season for at least Greeks and the eastern Europeans start soon in Greece. Not as good as it should be but better than nothing.Edited: 5:05 pm, May 01, 2020 "
"I find it funny that Greece having done a good job at crushing the virus with having a serious lock down, and limiting the number of fatalities to 140 would even think about opening the airports to UK flights, when we had nearly 800 fatalities yesterday. Yes I know that a lot of Greeks depend on tourism for their living, but I shudder to think of the carnage if tourists bring mass covid 19 to the mainland and the islands."
"I've said this on various threads on the Greece forum, but I find it inconceivable that Greece would allow UK visitors this year. Yes, it's sad for all our Greek friends who rely on tourism for their income and it's sad for everyone who looks forward to there holidays in the country (me included), but the amount of posts (literally thousands) from people moaning about vouchers, refunds etc sheds a slightly sad light on things in the general scale of what is happening in the World at the moment.Most of my holiday time is spent in southeast Asia, and with interest I've just found out that Thailand have just said no visas will be issued to UK residents till at least October! A sign of things to come I suspect!"
"It's also very sad for people who've not received refunds, & who've a lot of their hard earned money kept by travel companies, & who are now struggling to make ends meet having lost their jobs. Vouchers are only beneficial to those fortunate enough to be able to have another holiday.Yes, it's difficult for Greece & all other countries who rely on tourism, but it's a worldwide pandemic, & not many will come out of this sadly unaffected."
"Personally I would not go to a island this summer at all ! You fly in internationally , healthy , but perhaps exposed at airport or on plane , or perhaps the taxi or bus you take to your hotel . Many of the smaller ( populations) islands do not have proper hospitals - more like we should consider an emergency clinic - and you think it is fair to perhaps burden their medical system ?"
"Yiassas that is one of the most sensible posts I've read about the situation. I can't understand why anybody would want to travel anywhere until all this is over and there is a vaccine. Your last paragraph - "" life is more precious than money"" is so true. I've changed my booking from June this year to June 2021 but I'm still not confident I'll be going."
HelloI have vacbooked with my family July 15 to Italy. How do you think it looks for travel? We are coming from US
"Brilliant news if true about end of June for international flights, fingers crossed."
Our flights for June 17th to Preveza with BA have been cancelled today. We anticipated this and have arranged with our hotel to move our booking to the same time next year.
We are due to fly out 8th July and stay at petros penthouse so hopeful we will be able to still come
"Unfortunately, it's looking increasingly unlikely that visitors from the UK or even selected EU countries will be welcomed in Greece this year. https://www.ekathimerini.com/252430/article/…"
HayleyM I hope your booking for accommodation covers you for a refund if you can't go due to Covid-19 and this novel coronavirus. I think July 2020 is a bit soon for UK holiday makers to be getting back to Greece. Of course some flights might start and permanent residents permitted to travel who will then have to go into quarantine on arrival.
Stacy I wouldn’t count on it -
"Hayley M , Petros wife from Petros Penthouse here. I sent you a PM, check your TripAdvisor message box."
"My goodness, who in there right mind would think that any Greek would open there arms to ANY UK citizen this year, how inconsiderate for the silly poster who believes June/July will be acceptable. There will still be a very high chance of infection.And I would guess Mrs P doesn’t want you risking her place this year.Edited: 5:55 am, May 08, 2020 "
Perhaps HayleyM could update us on what Petrose's Wife had to say about their booking for July 8th ?
Think we might already know that one lol. Jollies in the garden this year.
"""My goodness, who in there right mind would think that any Greek would open there arms to ANY UK citizen this year, how inconsiderate for the silly poster who believes June/July will be acceptable.

"Yes, the silence from certain quarters is deafening but we're expecting the worst. The credit note system would be OK for us if our holiday is cancelled as I'm retired and Gill's got two weeks booked at the end of August but she keeps dropping hints about a caravan holiday in North Yorkshire Ha Ha."

Will I be able to find open restaurants? Shall I stayin carantine for 14days??Any suggestions from people living or travelled lately to Milan are very welcome!Thank you for your time, Marianna"
MariannaBest to post on the Milan board.People are asking and giving advice on what is happening in Greece (and specifically Parga) on this board.Here:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g187…
"Mariana : As a Greek National you'll be ok when you fly back but Italy did have a 14 day isolation period for arrivals so I'd check carefully before flying. You were also required to carry a form self certifying the reason for travelling to Italy so again ""When in doubt, check"" I'd go to Parga if I were you Ha Ha.YamasDave."
"I'm going in July even if i have to drive there as no scamdemic will ever put me off travelling,Pretty sure that flights will be back to normal by then anyhow but either way we'll be there which be even better with all the scared sheep locked away in their housesEdited: 10:09 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"#49 Really you are so selfish. Anyway,i'm pretty sure your trip won't happen."
~49 Don't be reckless Adrian. You might be there but you might have to isolate for 14 days when you get there and then quarantine (not isolate) for 14 days when you get back so you'll need 28 days off work. Great holiday that Mate.Wait until your holiday's cancelled and you get the Credit Note then you can book something else at 120% of the value of your July holiday at no extra cost.Think about it.
"#51 I know what you mean. I've just finished my beer :)Edited: 1:36 pm, May 17, 2020 "
Strange message from AdrianPRICtor me thinks
"Well said Adrian F. We should be there now, not bothered. 1st July booked, cancelled overnight stays in Manchester, cancel airport lounge, airport car parking and car hire from Preveza. If we loose the flight money (usually do package) so be it. We will see what September brings."
"A bit of good news for a change. Spoke to our Insurers this morning and they say if I cancel I'll only get 50% of the premium back less 15 % for good old ""administration"". Their T's & C's only allow people to transfer forward up to 12 months from the booking date which rules us out for July 2021 but on the plus side he's going to let me have a quote tomorrow which if we take he'll probably be able get us a full refund. I said ""with no administration charge"" but he didn't have a sense of humour. I've got high cholesterol, high blood pressure, Type 2 Diabetes and a Vitamin B12 deficiency but even with zero excess it only cost £79 which I thought was reasonable."

#57He actually found a £16 cheaper offer for 2021 which I bought and then got me a full refund off this year's policy. Looks like we might actually be going now cos the other day TUI were offering 656 Holidays to Greece flying on July 5th.YamasDave
"OPENING OF BORDERS When the land and sea borders to open - The 'green' and 'red' airports The quarantine is slowly coming to an end, as far as the countrys borders are concerned, which in a few days will be open both on land and at sea. According to SKAI, the countrys' land borders will be open from 15th June, and those who come to Greece will be subjected to random tests for coronavirus, no quarantine. The countrys maritime borders will open on 1st July, without quarantine. It is reminded that our country starts flights again on 29th June to and from 29 countries, according to the list issued by the European organisation for airport security.So the airports of these countries will be divided into 'red' and 'green'. Anyone coming from a 'green' airport will be subjected to a simple test, quarantine to apply only to travelers of 'red airports'. Anyone coming from a 'red' airport such as the Italian 'Emilia Romagna' at Bologna, 'Lombardy' at Milan and 'Piedmont' at Turin, but also those at Madrid and Barcelona, will be quarantined. As is 'Il De France' at Paris. Also 'red' are those of Liverpool, Manchester, Luton, Newcastle, Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds and Glasgow. Sources: https:/… and https://www.skai.gr/news/greece/apokalypsi-s…"
"And so they should be, looking at the flagrant lack of guidelines in the north of the country, these airports will be red for some time to come."
"SteveAndSoo left out one key phrase from the Skai story when they wrote: ""Also 'red' are those of Liverpool, Manchester, Luton, Newcastle, Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds and Glasgow.""Preceding that it says: ""For Britain, ""all 3 airports in London are considered red"""
"Doesn't make sense. ""The country's maritime borders will open on 1st July without quarantine but anyone coming from a 'red' airport will be quarantined"". And just where are they going to put them all ?It also goes against what the Minister Of Tourism said recently that all international airports will open on July 1st to people from all countries who will be allowed to enter without quarantine. Personally I think that's a bit reckless and would support a percentage of each flight being tested if they can get the results back quickly.YamasDave."
"HeimdallApologies, I merely copied and pasted the newsit.gr article."
So wonder what colour Edinburgh airport is as we usually fly to Corfu & ferry to Igoumenitsa. It should also be red I'd imagine?
"#64 No problems there Steve, I read the article and it's exactly what you posted but you've got to admit it's a bit strange that arrivals through the ports can waltz straight through while arrivals at airports will be quarantined.YamasDave"
"Note on Jet2Holidays' site yesterday ""we’ve decided to recommence our flights and holidays programme on 15 July 2020"""

"SFTYou should get your refund credit voucher and can use it plus your 20% booking incentive to rebook if that's what you want to do instead of taking the refund.If you booked online or via the app:""We understand that rather than waiting for your refund credit, you may want to amend your booking with your up to 20% booking incentive straight away, so we’ve set up our systems to make this possible.You can easily amend your booking on the Manage my Booking page .

"Unfortunately for us, despite having the May visit cancelled, all fully paid. I had an email telling me that as I already had a holiday booked for September this year and May and September next year I was not entitled to any 20% discount for any of the holidays. The good news is that 75% of May's money has paid off the September trip (if it happens) and just today £500 has been refunded to our bank. All bookings made were with TUI. We are cancelling our July visit but still waiting for EasyJet to cancel the flight (don't usually do flight only), Offered a voucher but we already have 3 holidays booked for next year and voucher lasts for 12 months. If we get a refund, great if not we will just loose £550 as decision made not to go. Don't fancy sitting on a plane wearing a mask with 200+ strangers."
"We have just recieved an email from Easyjet for our holiday in July , not cancelling but offering us an early opportunity to purchase vouchers with an added £10 tempter.. tbh we have taken it and will re-book at our leisure.. its a weight off our minds... we now have 12 months to spend it... and if it helps support the travel industry im up for that... ps how do Silver fox 2 xxd"
"The beach does look lovely though with the few sunbeds & lots of space, wish I was there now, instead of having to find a few square feet to put down our mat like we did last September."
Hi Satriani100Can I ask why you think Easyjet will not give you a refund or have I misread your post!!?Regards Flo
I am guessing Satriani100 thinks he will get a voucher and with holidays already booked he'll not use it. But if I was retired I'd find a use for it. But surely EasyJet do have to give a refund if the flight does not operate.
We were lucky when our Barcelona flight with Easyjet was cancelled in March. They emailed straight away and refunded me within a day. Obviously they now have a lot more cancellations to deal with and are hoping to not have to give refunds. I was hoping to change the booking to October but didn't get chance to contact then before the refund came!
"#69 We booked our 2021 holiday some time ago so have asked TUI to use the 2020 funds to pay it off. Gill doesn't want to book another holiday this year so the credit voucher system is not acceptable. TUI's e-mail says ""Your refund credit code will be emailed to you, along with details of the separate booking incentive up to 20% within 28 days of your original departure date"" which contravenes UK law which says I should be able to get a full cash refund within seven days of cancellation. I've e-mailed a complaint to HM Gov but it will just become a statistic and will take ""up to 20 days"" to get a response.YamasDave."
"SFTIs the law really 7 days?Or is it 14?Regardless of the timescalesThe 'full cash refund within seven (or 14) days of cancellation' law was really not designed to work in this unprecedented situation we find ourselves in.Even ABTA says this:""If you booked a package holiday, you are entitled to a refund. We completely understand that for those customers that would prefer a refund to rebooking, you may be frustrated and concerned by the amount of time it is taking.

""I don't think TUI have covered themselves in glory throughout this (and they seem to be continuing that trend) but they are not refusing you a full refund.They have just put some process in place to delay giving customers that refund. I'd guess that was a business decision which has resulted in huge negative customer service opinion against the company.They may or may not recover from those decisions they made.You will get your code and your refund.I'm not sure of the reasoning behind putting it towards a holiday a year in advance. Personally, I'd hang on to that money until the balance became due in 2021. But we all see things differently. I agree that your email to HM Govt will just become a statistic, but maybe it made you feel better. (I really hope you didn't say you were entitled to a refund within 7 days)."
"Hi!The reason I asked is Satriani100 expecting to lose the money he paid for his flights!? We were booked with BA flight only for the 17th June. I received an email about 5 weeks ago, flight cancelled, was offered a voucher but really didn't want to take this as who knows what will happen within the timeframe given to use it! I called the number provided and got through on second attempt, asked for a refund and the money was in my bank 4 days later!  Regards Flo"
"Hi Flo, I am hoping for a refund. The email said I had up to midnight on the 16th June to claim the voucher and a £10 bonus. Voucher lasts for 12 months. However as said, already booked for early May, June/July and end of September we decided to ignore the email and see if they cancel in the hope that the money will be refunded, even if it takes a month or so.

""14 DAYS.This is taken for MoneySavingExpert website:""Package holiday cancelled? Again, you're due cash, not vouchers – but that could changeCurrently, package holidaymakers whose trips are cancelled are entitled to all their money back WITHIN TWO WEEKS under the Package Travel Regulations.""TWO WEEKSArticle by Simon Calder, travel writer for the Independent:https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…""I have a package holiday booked to depart in June. What are my rights?It is almost certain to be cancelled. In theory you are entitled to a full cash refund WITHIN TWO WEEKS of the cancellation becoming known (which will almost always be before the date of departure).""TWO WEEKSSo where is the law that you say entitles you to a refund with 7 days?I don't disagree that TUI are flouting the law.But what is the law?If you don't get your facts right, you run the risk of being fobbed off even more than if your complaint is accurate, concise and unemotional."
"Hi Paula, I can't remember his name but I listened to a Government Spokesman on TV a couple of weeks ago and he said that UK Law was 7 days. However, according to Google, EU Law is 14 days as you say so perhaps UK law is different to EU Law as witnessed by the various Coronavirus ""guidlenes"" different countries have ? I emphasise ""guidelines"" as that's exactly what they are, not Rules as Suzanne Reid said about social distancing on GMB this morning. However you look at it ""28 days from the date of the booking"" way exceeds 14 days from the date of cancellation as required by law and that's just the deadline for a credit note refund, if you want a cash refund you have to start the process when you have a reference number."
"As ABTA is the Association of BRITISH Travel Agents I'd expect them to quote the law appropriate to UK (and Britain).MoneySavingExpert is a UK website.Simon Calder writes for a UK newspaper.I'd expect them all to quote the law that applies to the UK.But as you will, if you're convinced that someone else said it was 7 days.As someone who used to work with customer complaints, it always amused us when someone quoted 'the law' at us and they were wrong.I'm not disputing that TUI are way outside the timescales they should be working to.I'd bet that you get a very similar response to what ABTA say (if you get one at all):""We completely understand that for those customers that would prefer a refund to rebooking, you may be frustrated and concerned by the amount of time it is taking. In normal circumstances a refund should be paid WITHIN 14 DAYS. But these circumstances are extraordinary, and it is simply impossible for many companies to pay monies back as quickly as they would like to as many have not yet received money back from hotels, airlines and other suppliers affected by the crisis.

"It's interesting how a post highlighting how Greece is handling a global pandemic and planning positively for the future has degenerated into a debate about the number of days someone has to wait for a refund. People in Greece suffered the complete loss of almost a year's income only last year when Thomas Cook folded, this year, their working season has been halved (if tourists come to Greece). Yet, this tragedy seems to pale into insignificance when compared to the delay in receiving a guaranteed refund for a relatively small amount of money.I'm saddened."

"#91 - totally agree with your comments. Though personally I don't find it ^interesting^, I find it painfully boring. The whole Greece forum is swamped with hundreds,,if not thousands of posts on exactly the same subject from umpteen people swapping small talk about refunds"
"Well said Steve.I find it sad too. And also repetitive when people ask about refunds or whether we think their holiday will happen. None of us on here has any say on refunds or whether holidays or flights will get cancelled.I see some on the town beach on the camera. I hope more tourists are going to get to all of Greece soon. Take care all locals and travellers.Edited: 5:39 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"How true. I think it's a sad reflection of just how self-centred some people can be.I'm alright Jack, pull the ladder up."
The way I see it is if you can afford to book and pay for a holiday that is disposable income. If the holiday did not happen then you did not need that money. But I do realise in these times some people may have lost jobs and therefore loss of income. But at the moment in the UK most will have been on furlough.If we all eventually get back the money or a voucher we can use - not the end of the world. But again I know some people have less money set aside just in case than others.
"@91, 93, 94, 95. 96I agree.I've read so many posts - not just on the Parga board and not just on Greece Tripadvisor and not just on Tripadvisor - complaining about refunds from various tour operators.OK, some people may NEED a refund if they are financially struggling (although hopefully things should be easing with the lifting of restrictions and opening of more shops) but I really don't understand this need to fire off emails complaining about the length of time a refund is taking.I'm saddened too, although I think part of it is some people are worried that the tour operator may go under and that's why they are so desperate to get their money back.But I'm not the one firing off emails complaining about the length of time a refund is taking.I'm just the one pointing out 'the law' and alternative ways to get the money back if you're that desperate for the money.For the record, I had my holiday cancelled too.I've left the money where it is and rebooked exactly the same holiday for next year.If I'd decided that I wanted a refund, I'd have waited until TUI sent me the refund credit code and then applied online for the refund.I should be in Greece right now.I'm thinking about the small places we give our custom to who will be struggling part way through the season with almost no business so far and probably reduced business for the rest of the season.I'm thinking about the risks to the Greek people once all countries are allowed in.Quotes from posts above:""And also repetitive when people ask about refunds or whether we think their holiday will happen. None of us on here has any say on refunds or whether holidays or flights will get cancelled.""""The whole Greece forum is swamped with hundreds,,if not thousands of posts on exactly the same subject from umpteen people swapping small talk about refunds""Because they don't read other people's posts or they think their circumstances may be slightly different.Because it's important to them.Because they're worried about actually getting the money back.Because they want reassurance - even from random strangers on t'interweb - that of course their holiday will happen and that it will just as wonderful as previous years.Because Tripadvisor is not just for the good times - and not just for information on how any country is handling covid. It's impossible - on virtually any public forum - to stop a thread going off-topic."
"Would you take a risk and book a holiday to Parga now, thinking about 19th July? Does the prospect of random tests and the delay from this and then having to self isolate for 24 hours put you off? We would be self catering so woukd still have to go shopping after leaving the airport."
"Hi Paula ,we are supposed to be going to Zante on 18th July self catering with jet 2 ,we was due to check in this Saturday when I go on manage my booking it has just changed to check in 4th July ,so still don’t know if we are going ,booked it last August by the way."
"Just a point, have Greece said they're taking UK airports off the naughty ""Red"" list yet ?"
"@ #100Not yet, but more importantly, the UK FCO is still advising against all non essential foreign travel, so all insurance would be void."
"Interesting article from 5 days ago https:/…To be honest I'm actually pleased TUI finally cancelled our July 5th holiday cos who wants to spend 7 days in a ""designated hotel"" even after testing negative ? With my luck I'd be one of the ""random samplings"" he mentions cos I often get pulled at Customs Ha Ha.YamasDave"
"Exactly Steve, on so many forums the repeated question of when we can travel comes up, & I've said the same thing that atm the FCO restrictions would need to be lifted before travel."
