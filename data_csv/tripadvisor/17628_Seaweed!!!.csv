"Just kidding. Finishing a week here in playa mujeras. Had one day where a small line of sea weed weed up, otherwise pure white sand."
Lol! That's good to hear.
"You got me! My wife and I were at Secrets Maroma the first week of February and there was a major sargassum spell. The resort did it's best, but it was impossible for even the tractor to keep up. I am hoping Playa Mujeres is better in a couple weeks."
I'm going to TRS Coral (The Royal Suites) in January. Were you anywhere near there? It's on Costa Mujeres. TIA
Hi planning to go to excellence playa Mujeres in nov has anyone been there recently and is there sargassum there
We walked down last week while at EPM and there was much more seaweed at that end. EPM had a bit our last day but it was very minimal. Royal Suites will be beautiful when done. I’ll be surprised if it opens in November. We willl be back at EPM in November and will take a walk down there to see how it is progressing.
Hi how was epm? Was there a lot to do there or was it quiet ?
It was lovely. We are quite content to sit on the beach and enjoy the sun and ocean. I can’t comment on what activities take place by the pool. They have various bands playing in the evening and shows in the theatre. The entertainment runs till about 11:00 and then moves over to the sports bar where they have a DJ and you can dance. Anytime we have been there it has been a lot of fun.
Thank you so much I am trying to plan our honeymoon and so concerned with this sargassum epidemic So if you say you sat on the beach it must be free of seaweed. Am I correct in thinking this way????
"I am going to EPM this week and will also like to find out about if seaweed is an issue there.When I visited Beloved on June, they had some issue with the seaweed so..."
Where is beloved ?What type of hotel is that? Adults only???
Beloved is right next to EPM and is also managed by the Excellence Group.It is for adults only and it is an all inclusive hotel just like EPM
Thank youWhich do you prefer beloved or epm?Which is more fun?
"I've never been to EPM so there is nothing I can say about that place.(I am actually visiting EPM this week so maybe I can compare them later?)But as for Beloved, it was very low-key and quiet. (Still there was a lot of activities to participate in)They have fewer restaurants compared to EPM but it was more than enough for me.Service from staff members was exceptional and I guess that is same with EPM."
Thank you plz give us an update on the beach and sargassum I’m planning to book soonAlso in the fun or not fun of rpm if you don’t mind
I will let you know about how it was in EPM as soon as I get back Hopefully I don't have to encounter seaweed issue there :)
"Kathy B - yhe sargassum issue thus far has been sporadic and there isn't a long enough history to predict with any accuracy what conditions will be like next week, much less next month or next year.If a beach is really important to you, my advice would be to seek out locations that haven't had this problem AT ALL - e.g. the west coast of Mexico. West facing beaches in the Caribbean don't seem to have been affected anything like as much as those facing east, so that may be an option if the Pacific Coast of Mexico doesn't appeal to you.If you really want to go to this part of Mexico, then I'd politely suggest you look for a hotel with decent pools and with a layout such that you don't have to be overlooking (or within smelling distance) of the beach. That way, if the sargassum does hit when you're there, at least you'll have some options.Good luck with whatever you decide.Edited: 2 years ago "
Thank you
Where did you stay?
