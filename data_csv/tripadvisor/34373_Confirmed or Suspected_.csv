"Just curious if anyone is confirmed or suspected for COVID-19.I suspect we are, but none of us have much of a fever (just pretty much every other symptom) and we're not in the at-risk groups, so they won't test us, and the online screening that goes off to a doctor keeps telling me I have a cold, even though I have no issues with a runny or stuffy nose. Just closely watching symptoms and self-isolating, hoping they stay mild and mostly contained with OTC drugs. The last couple of days, the symptoms haven't improved, but they haven't gotten worse, so I'm hoping we're going over the hump right now. At least we're all sleeping relatively well; much better than I do with a normal flu."
"I would contact a physician.No one here can diagnose you.Sorry,Hunt"
OTC drugs... Hmm does that explain the OTC forum?
We are all on them.
"I'm more bored. The last time I was in a crowd was on March 1, even then the bar I was at was using disposable cups instead of the usual glasses. It was a beer garden, so even though social distancing wasn't yet a thing, people were aware and keeping their distance.Edited: 12:44 am, March 27, 2020 "
Ask yourself this. Are your symptoms so bad you'd normally seek help? Fever and cough aren't fun but the big worry is if you develop breathing issues. If you're asking how you should act. Assume it's the virus and avoid contact with others.

It's when the coughing starts you have to be aware.Think I had it back the end of January. You can't stop the coughing. That might be the time to contact a doctor though they can't do anything. Trouble breathing or pain across your lower ribcage is the time to get real medics involved.It spread around the town and the cough was distinctive but we didn't know about it then though it was obvious to me that I had to stay away from everyone whenever I could.Keep at a constant temperature and rest.Hope it's not what you think.
Misread Mike. Thought it was the 27 April!I think I can be excused. I'm not even sure what day it is.

FYI OTC = over the counter
OTC= Off Topic Chatter ! I’m not sure if that’s a remedy for COVID. Me and my wife are pretty sure we got the virus in late January. All the symptoms but we couldn’t get tested. Back then they were saying just to go about your daily business and your chances of getting the virus are extremely low.
"Hadn't even heard of it to be honest. I rarely get these bugs and as people say, just thought it was a bit of flu but it didn't materialise quite the same then the coughing started. Sheesh I thought I'd never sleep and I'd break a rib.Glad I didn't know or I would have been really frightened. As it was I was just really p£ssed off at missing stuff."
"I got sick on New Years Day. I just figured I had the flu - much worse than I had ever had before though. But it lingered on and I wound up going to the doctor after about two weeks. Finally went away by week three. I don't think any of us were even aware of 'the virus' at that time, but I wonder if I had an early round of it. When I visited my doctor, when she came in the room she was wearing a mask. My first thought was 'why is she afraid of me - she is around sick people all day!'. I asked her and she said no, she is wearing the mask to protect ME from HER as she had also been sick. Seems that is something that a lot of people don't understand - the mask is to protect others from you, not necessarily protect you from them.The good news is that whatever I had, whether it was just the virus or a terrible strain of flu (I do get the flu shot every year)...I survived. Having just had open heart surgery about six weeks earlier, I was definitely in the high risk group."
"Oh my jlr51, that's some combination. Hope both bits of you are better now.I got the pain across my back which I thought might be pleurisy or strain from coughing. When I went to the doctor for something else he said he;d had it too and how awful it was.3 weeks for me too. Took some time to be able to go out with a walking group and make a hill in one go and I'm usually the one in front."
