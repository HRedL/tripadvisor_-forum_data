Is anyone in Kenya planning on staying through this coronavirus pandemic? I am and am wanting a friend. Currently in Nairobi planning on getting to the coast and sitting it out. Let me know if you are interested in joining me whilst the trains and domestic flights are still up and running
I have lived in Nairobi for well over seven years; I consider it to be my home. I will be here throughout the epidemic.
"Thanks for your response. I was actually looking for someone who was travelling as opposed to living here. Someone who wanted to post up on a beach somewhere, split the cost and let the pandemic pass us by. Does that sound like something you would want to do? xx"
"I'd recommend liaising with Immigration, if there is a risk of your visa expiring while you are in the country. Don't just leave it to chance, or make assumptions that it will be OK. Immigration can be incredibly bureaucratic and petty, so using Coronavirus as the reason for overstaying may not 'wash' as daft as the sounds.. Overstaying is normally treated seriously."
"Hi, thanks for your message but I have already extended my visa :)I'm just looking for someone to chill with. Looks like I'll just have to meet them in Malindi!"
"Good Luck!! Maybe it is safe to travel to Africa for the time being.As the novel coronavirus rages through the world and spreads rapidly in the U.S and Europe. Africa is the least-affected continent at the moment, with less than 8,000 reported cases in its 54 countries so far. A number of media outlets have reacted with a confounded tone, surprised that Africa does not have more cases and wondering if the low numbers are due to a lack of testing."
