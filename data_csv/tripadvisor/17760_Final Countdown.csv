Hello everyone! Well im onto the final countdown to the next trip just less than 48 hours till i depart. Got the bag ready will start packing tonight or just do it tomorrow. Im just about to go and drop noise box aka the PUP to the kennel for his holiday. Everything else is good to go! Still trying to work out what to do/see this time some idea's but will go with the flow i think. Have already booked a car for at least 3 days so that will be good! Thinks there has been a bit or rain and looks like the will be some more while im away. Anyone just come back? What has the weather been like? Talk Soon
"Hi Bluestreek,Got back last week,We had mainly great weather....very HOT! We did have a couple of days that it rained all day, and a few arvos where it became overcast. One day it got up to 36 degrees!But then again...we are on holidays!!Have a great time, very jelous!!"
How exciting........its finally here. Have a wonderful and safe trip. Looking forward to hearing all about it on your return.Nola :)
"Whatever the weather have a great time Blue. We had two days of rain and some more overnight (that is the best) and the grand daddy of all thunderstorms that shook the ground. Hopefully you will have blue skies all the way. Enjoy, Barb"
"Have a great trip Blue, and enjoy the food. and most importantly have fun.Looking forward to your report when you return."
"Thanks everyone! Whatever the weather it doesn't bother me just as good as in any heat, rain, wind! Well less than 24 hours to go now! I am about to go start packing the bag! Pup went to the kennel yesterday for the first time and was more than happy to share a kiss with his new female attendant and leave mummy without a fuss talk about sharing the love the little tartlett! Hoping he will have a great time while im gone! Well back to the packing!!!!!!!"

Hello Maree and thanks for the kind message! Im still online fiddling about with things! I will now try and leave my trusty computer and go and pack the bag again! At this rate i may never be done so many distractions! Thanks for following my posts! Will be doing reviews when i return!
Have a wonderful holiday Bluestreek.......am so envious. Look forward to hearing about your trip when you return home. Happy packing.
Have a good holiday blue. A bit jealous. Working in the Pilbara WA now and unable to go away until at least 2012. Will have to just put up with reading others reports and dreaming.
Yay finally packed!!!!!!! Now finishing off last minute stuff!!!! New bag half the size of old one and is not quite filled! Thank goodness!
Hope you have a nice relaxing holiday Blue --- sunny days for you and rainy nights to help with the drought problem.Hope you get some sleep tonight ~~~~Julie.
"Hi bluestreek - was just checking out some of the latest reviews on Sonaisali and realised we hadn't heard from you since your trip. How did it go? Are you OK as we haven't seen you on the forums lately....... I notice we have a few more really bad one off reviews but when I narrowed it down to ""family reviews"" they are all mainly positive - so I'm sticking with SI for now and still have 5 nights booked in May."
"Hello everyone, Just wanted to let you all know i have returned from my holiday and the holiday its self went very well. However i came home very ill with a gastro/vomiting bug that i had for well over a week and straight after that now have a chest infection so have been sick for over a month now. I have not been online much and have yet to do any reviews! I am planning on doing some. I have just sent my brother his wife and her father to Sonaisali today they have just arrived!"
"Glad to hear you had a good time, but not that you got sick.Get better soon :)Nola :)"
Oh - not good BS. Hope you recover soon! Now sending the family off to your fav destination is a good sign........ hope they have a great time too.
"I was wondering if you were back BS, so good to hear from you, and hope you are feeling much better now. Nothing worse than feeling sick, especially a bug as you described.Bet your pup was pleased to see you!And Merry Christmas/ festive season, hope 2011 is the best. Are you planning another trip yet?Edited: 9 years ago "
"I hope you recover soon- I'm stuck at home with a virus which is contagious- same symptoms as you and had a fever too. Apparently there's an epidemic in Sydney , and our friends in Fiji mentioned something similar is going around there also"
"Was windering wher you had got to. Glad the holiday was good but what rotten luck to get a virus. Take care of yourself and have a wonderful Christmas. Only two sleeps to go for us, amazing I still get excited. Barb"
"Hey everyone, yep still sick which sucks i have never ever in the whole time ive been going to Fiji come home this sick its horrible stuff. There is a bug like this doing the rounds in Fiji it has for a few months. Just some people get it its not everyone so im just one of the unlucky people i guess. The time to get over it is the worst after you have finished with the gastro/vomiting which goes for days you have a nausea feeling for over a week to deal with its dreadful. Im hoping my brother his pregnant wife and her father who i sent off yesterday do not come down with anything. Anyways already thinking of the next trip and when it will be!"
"Hello everyone, well after a medical nightmare coming home very very ill from this last trip i am finally starting to feel better thank goodness! I brought home the horrible vomit/gastro bug that is currently doing the rounds in Fiji. Most people do not get it but just my luck i did and a good one to. Combined with all my other medical issues it has been a shocker! The holiday however was wonderful as always have just put up a review for Sonaisali and a few photos for everyone to see. Already starting to think about planning the next holiday back again. Looking at October/November again i think. I will be trying to put up a review over the next few days of Sonaisali's fine dining restaurant Plantation have some delicious photos of the fine food i previously talked to you all about! Talk Soon"
"So great to hear from you Blue, wondered where you had gotten too. Not good about the bug you picked up, at least you are feeling better now.I myself are in the process of trying to plan a return trip to Mana in October.Nola :)"
"Hey Nola, Thanks good to be back online. The bug doing the rounds is just horrible. I had friends over just before me and they came back fine and family after me came back well. Luck of the draw. So glad i came down ill only on the last day/night of the holiday. Isn't it good always being able to try and work out when the next trip is. Last trip we decided to add a few more nights next trip as we fly AirPacific and they arrive so late you kind of loose a night and also the early flight the last day home. Im thinking October Late or November early or a combo of both. So how long are you thinking of going for?"
We usually only go for a week. Was looking at late October myself.Nola :)
