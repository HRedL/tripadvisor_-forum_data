I saw that the first case of COVID-19 in the USVI was reported today on www.worldometer.com does anyone know any details of the case. The site did not provide any details. I am wondering what island and what was the source?
The confirmed case is on St. Croix. Here is a link I've seen... https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…
It was posted to TA on just about every relevant USVI thread yesterday.
...coming to St. John next week—anything of note there as yet? Nervous but not in panic mode. Thanks
Nothing of note.
"<< ""anything of note there as yet?"" >><< ""Nothing of note."" >>I'm reminded of the old joke about the optimist that fell off the observation deck of the Empire State Building.As he passes a window on the 75th floor, an office worker asks him ""How are things going?""The falling guy replies ""So far, no problems."":-)"
What does that comment mean?
I think they mean nothing is really a problem until it IS a problem. There is another reported case in this district and 17 more awaiting results.
"The longer people fail to socially distance themselves from others, the longer this will go on and the worse it will be. Apparently not many people get it. The numbers of cases and deaths continue to grow daily."
"And the recovery rate of closed cases has remained extremely high at 92%, dropping only 1% from 93% in 7 days."
"STT, I'm not sure why this is so difficult for you to grasp. It is all about slowing the spread so that hospital systems don't get overwhelmed. If that happens, we're looking at an exact repeat of what's happening in Italy right now. There is no grey area, it's dead simple. Nobody is saying everyone will die, but you're looking at a difference in death rate going from .3% for areas that do a good job getting it contained, to 7% for areas that don't (Italy). What you are doing is dangerous, you're giving other people false confidence during a pandemic that's spiraling out of control. Why? It's incredibly irresponsible, to say the absolute least.Edited: 8:46 am, March 17, 2020 "
"I grasp it all. Italy is a very rare case for many different reasons and has been under constant analysis and speculation as to why, with many different hypotheses presented but as yet nothing conclusive. This is a virus which comes, flashes through and then dies out as do they all. I am simply giving verifiable statistics in order to keep things in perspective. I'm all for containment whether it be sane national/international containment or sensible self-isolation and social distancing. What I do try and correct when necessary is the slew of misunderstanding and outright misinformation which has become the scourge of this pandemic.If that offends you or bothers you then for that I have no response but to suggest that I'm promoting ""danger"" is unwarranted."
"Whatever happened in Italy is now happening in Spain. The number of cases went up 2000 overnight, from 9,100 to 11,100.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he was imposing drastic measures to fight the coronavirus, forcing people to stay indoors, with exemptions only for so-called exceptional circumstances.https:/…spain-coronavirus.htmlIf only people would pay attention now before we become like Spain and Italy."
"Wow. ""This is a virus which comes, flashes through and then dies out as do they all. I am simply giving verifiable statistics in order to keep things in perspective.""Care to back that up with real, verifiable data? Absolutely nobody knows what this thing is going to do. If you paid any attention to the actual health professionals who study this (clearly you don't, or you wouldn't make baseless, dangerous statements like this), you wouldn't be so careless. Seriously, please show me a CREDIBLE, VERIFIABLE source showing that this thing will ""flash through"" and die out. I'll wait. You're making blatantly false statements. For what reason, I can't guess.Edited: 9:33 am, March 17, 2020 "
"The only ""misinformation"" in this exchange is coming from you, STT. Please stop."
"No need for you to wait. This is an excellent source of real data, real statistics, meticulously kept updated and with pretty much every conceivable statistical breakdown you could want:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/You surely are already aware without even poring through statistics that Wuhan has seen a drastic reduction in the number of new cases. As typical of viruses it came, swept through and is now receding and going onto new grounds where it will inevitably repeat the same cycle."
"China has been on complete lock down, everyone forced to stay in their homes, first off. We aren't doing that, and probably couldn't even if ""we"" wanted to. That's why it's slowing in China. Anthony Fauci has been very clear that this thing is just getting started. The actual experts who do this for a living are expecting it to roar back as soon as China goes back to ""normal"" functioning society. A few things to back up points that I have been making, other than just tossing out some random stats. I'm sure this will change your opinion not at all, but maybe it'll help someone else. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/20…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYHFv5rzaKMhttps:/…china-coronavirus-cost.htmlhttps://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSwHighly recommend the second youtube link for anyone who cares to listen to a real expert in the field. Not a random TA poster. Germany just flat out announced to their citizens that at least 60% of them are likely to catch the virus. The UK is predicting the same. There was also a leaked brief yesterday from US govt health professionals predicting the same here. You know what? It doesn't really matter what evidence I show you, you're not going to change your tune until it's too late. But I'm not going to stop chiming in here. It's too important. You're being incredibly short sighted, and rather obtuse.Edited: 10:05 am, March 17, 2020 "
It started in November 2019 in China. It's taken nearly 4 months and a total lockdown to start declining. Let's learn from China and not let it progress to the same point while we have a chance.
"<< ""That's why it's slowing in China."" >>Agreed. The Chinese experience with this is not reflective of the natural cycle of how a virus spreads/declines. It's representative of how much control an authoritarian regime can exert over the daily lives of a highly compliant populace.Edited: 10:13 am, March 17, 2020 "
"The state of Ohio is taking this very serious. Schools, church, libraries, restaurants (they can do carry-out only), bars, gyms, rec centers, bowling alleys, etc, etc.,, all closed for at least 3 weeks. Pet expo was cancelled. THE Arnold body building expo was closed to spectators (this draws 250,000 people normally). Employees who can work from home are encouraged to do so. Voting was cancelled today.So we are basically forced to isolate ourselves. We are due to arrive STT on April 16th. We will watch how CV-19 plays out, but we still plan on going if our flight isn't cancelled. Selfish? Maybe."
"Not maybe. Ohio is estimating as of yesterday 100k infected, Indiana says probably 60k. The really sad thing is by the time the people in denial realize the severity, it will be too late. I have lost a lot of faith in humanity this last week. People are far stupider than I though, and I didn't think most people were brilliant to begin with. This particular forum has really surprised me. Usually one of the more level-headed forums around. Definitely changes my opinion of some of you."
"""Definitely changes my opinion of some of you."" Indeed. That, however, doesn't see me stoop to berating, ridiculing and dismissing those whose opinions differ from mine. 'Twould be nice if that were so universally."
"Stooping? No. I'm countering your false information during a global pandemic. Because you still want to make people feel as if it's okay to travel, despite near every government in the civilized world telling people to stay the hell home. It's simple. Stop putting forth your opinion as if it were fact. You're giving flatly false information, repeatedly. It's total BS. Stop it, and I'll stop rebutting you.Edited: 10:33 am, March 17, 2020 "
"By the time of our trip, we will be in isolation for 4 weeks (sounds depressing doesn't it?) So either we already have been exposed to it, get it/ have it, and won't go, or we don't have it and we're going. But like I said, we will keep watching & reading the news (and forums)."
"""I'm countering your false information during a global pandemic.""No false information, just statistics and the local information requested; no encouragement either way, giving people information so they can make their own decisions. Until such time as there's a total lockdown on travel you have no right to constantly and rudely berate people."
Just fear mongering by TIMMMAAY. Way past any kind of helpful info. Really a shame that people have to get to this point.
"What world do you live in, soundtrader? Do you not see entire countries shutting down? Has this ever happened before? Ever? Almost every major government telling people to stay home. Restaurants, bars, events closing, all of sports shut down entirely. But yes, clearly I'm ""fearmongering"". You can't fix stupid.Edited: 11:22 am, March 17, 2020 "
"Try sharing some accurate info TIMMMAAY, rather than posting opinions and possible worst case statistics as facts. That is fear mongering."
"Absolutely every single thing that I have posted is accurate, and verifiable. Just because people like you don't accept reality, doesn't change the truth. You can keep your head in the sand, but I'm not sure what you think you are accomplishing?"
Are there elderly in the VI's? YesAre there vulnerable poplulations? YesAre people dying because of this? YesCan seemingly healthy people transmit this? (even if you have been in your home for weeks it doesn't mean people on your plane have been)-YESIs your vacation worth the possiblity you could be the one bringing it into the territory and infecting the elderly and vulnerable? NO
"Ah, TIMMMAAY...much as I love STT Rez I stopped arguing with her during Zika. I have degrees in Microbiology and Public Health, and part of my job is reading and evaluating scientific publications; however, the current situation is rapidly evolving so I am happy to trust the experts and if they say it is serious, stay home that is enough for me."
"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-co…This links to the actual report that made the US govt change their messaging in the past few days, UK govt as well. For anyone who cares to read it."
"Listening to the daily government task force updates, combined with the texts I am receiving from family living in northern Italy is enough for me. Not sure what else anyone really needs to hear at this point...the ones who aren’t listening are the ones I am fearful of and for."
"We live in RI. Restaurants are closed until at least 4/7. Casinos are closed for 2 weeks. Schools are closed for at least 2 weeks. Bars closed. Dentists have been asked to only see emergencies. Malls are closed. We have been asked not to gather in crowds larger than 25. Governor has asked people to stay home. I believe only West Virginia has had no reports of the virus so far. A few weeks ago when this started and they began the piece meal closings each day I said why don’t they just shut it all down. If they had we might be a little ahead of the curve but not sure. One of the grocery stores here in town is now opening 6-7:30 am for folks 60 and over.And we are the smallest state in US and only 22 confirmed cases as of 5 pm today. I asked the question last week if STT or any USVI island might prohibit continental US from coming for fear of spreading this sickness. I’m following hand washing protocols and social distancing. Most people who do contract the illness can recover at home. Here in RI only one person was hospitalized, the rest have recovered at home. So to sum it up I wouldn’t get on a plane right now. Just too much uncertainty and from what we are hearing this could extend into May. Time will tell. Stay safe everyone."
"Our relatives in Italy plead with us to LISTEN to the advice given and do what is needed before we regret it. They said, ""we all felt fine, thinking, I'll be OK,...everyone around me feels fine..."" Until they weren't."
"Soundtrader - why attack someone who is trying to provide factual information to everyone? There's no ulterior motive against St. John here. I'm sorry if your vacation might get disrupted but it's a fact that this is not a time to travel. If you need citations, there are plenty to provide."
We now have a third confirmed case. And they expect two more positives at least based on proximity of two of the people to other confirmed cases. This most recent positive was in the STT-STJ district.
There’s a child that’s positive on St John.....
"So sorry to hear that. Stay safe, be well."

Stjohnjulie - I can’t find anything saying St. John has the positives? I heard St. Thomas at the Ritz? Could you please share?
I need to take that back!!! I read it online and they updated it to say two negative on St. John. I will request my post removed.
Sorry - wasn’t pointing finger - genuinely wanting to know as we’ve heard ‘rumors’ but wanting confirmation.
"Stone Post, not at all! I didn't take it that way :) I checked back a couple of hours after I initially read it and they changed it. I immediately came back to take that down. There are 6 confirmed right now and that number is expected to grow. Concerning is one of the confirmed cases is and airport employee who hasn't traveled recently. Tracing the people they had contact with might prove to be very difficult."
