Just back today and just giving heads up on quick onset sick bug about. I caught it and was rough fir about 10 hours. Yes I wash my hands and no I had not drank.
"To be honest Fearless, it’s a bit short on specifics or suspected location of cause to be particularly useful. I’ve had a similar thing at home this past week which lasted 4 days but these things happen at home or abroad. Mine certainly wasn’t drink and I always wash my hands.Do you suspect a cause, a place, a meal, the plane? Jules"
"It seems it's just going round,people from all diff hotels apartments, so was told up to 400 a day in area at mo. You just feel bit sick suddenly at within few minutes everything up. People being sick at market in street whom sober and flying home few hours later. My Mrs was ok and we ate drank Tec same places so God knows."

"I don't know if 400 true,just what being said ,but deff enough. Still cant complain to much, I came back 5 pound lighter than I went 4 days before.lol"
What a strange post this is! I live in Benidorm and not heard about that. Nobody I know is ill apart from the usual colds etc. The doctors or Farmacia don't seem overly busy either.Steve
"Just thinking the same Steve, I've not heard of anyone with a sickness bug at all"
"Came home yesterday after 3 weeks in Benidorm and not seen or heard about anything other than usual Beni cough, including amongst friends who live there."
Probably taken to Benidorm from UK.
"We came home yesterday and while there didn't see anyone being sick in the hotel or streets. Our friends are still there, staying in a different hotel, and no reports of anyone sick there either. A few people coughing on the way home but that's the norm!"
Post #2.....400 a day would be classed as a disaster in any holiday area. The whole story doesn't ring true. I've been asking around and nobody seems to know anything about it. Steve
"I had a sickness and poo day while we where in Beni last week ,it knocked me for six and didn’t feel right for the rest of our holiday .We arrived home yesterday and feel ok now ,I always wash my hands and we r careful where we eat and drink so I don’t know what is was ,but there was certainly a lot of sick and poo lol"
"Obviously it is here in the UK too. People do travel with it and it just spreads. Not saying it came from the UK but it is both countries. Remember one year, seemed as if quite a few Spanish became ill first, they had it, then it spread quite quickly within the hotel. Happens quite a lot during the winter. In hotels it mainly spreads on the serving spoons and tongs in the dining room buffet. Seen people on the way into the dining room pretending to use the sanitizer gel. Why anyone would pretend to wash their hands is puzzling.Washing hands when leaving the dining room is as important as on the way in. Hope you are on the mend.Edited: 6:20 pm, January 29, 2020 "
