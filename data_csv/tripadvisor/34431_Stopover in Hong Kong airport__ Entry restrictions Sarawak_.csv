"We are leaving from Brussels to Kuala Lumpur in a few weeks time with Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong airport (2 hour stopover). We will stay in Kuala Lumpur for 3 nights before flying to Kuching. With the latest travel restrictions for Sarawak, would this cause a problem?Is a stopover in HK airport considered ""travelled to China"" as stated below or is a stopover in Hong Kong airport OK to be allowed into Sarawak?""The Sarawak Disaster Management Committee Secretariat has imposed a temporary entry restriction into Sarawak to all citizens of China and other foreigners who have travelled to China in the last 14 days, with immediate effect."""
I replied to the following a couple of days ago.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g298…Hope it helps.An online search could be more up to date - look out for The Borneo Post articles.
Thanks for the reply.Unfortunately it is not clear if a stopover in HK is considered 'staying in China' or not...
"Keep in view of this post from our authorities. https://www.tourism.gov.my/news/trade/view/m…In your case, it will be best to contact Sarawak authorities directly for clarity.https:/…page-0-127-84-Contact-us.html"
Thanks.I sent them an email. I hope they reply and shed some light on this. I will post their reply here as it could be useful for others too.
You should receive a reply from Monday onwards and reposting here with updates will be great too.
"Agree about re-posting replies.But, for information and from experience, do not expect a rapid response to your e-mail as the various Malaysian government departments are notoriously slow to reply."
"@Delectatio,My Sarawak contacts states that such flight route (via Hong Kong) are subject to scrutiny prior to entering Sarawak. Nonetheless, they advised to call the Immigration Department for the state of Sarawak to eliminate any possibility of latency from other source.supsrwk.gov.my/index.php/en/federal-departme…Hope this helps."
"Thanks for the effort. It is just very unclear what 'scrutiny' means... Is it just some questions, a medical exam, quarantaine...? I am really disappointed that there are no clear rules written down somewhere online. To make it even more confusing Malaysian Airlines (I found the Sarawak entry restrictions info on their website initially) is still selling tickets from HK to Kuching with a KL stopover?"
Scrutiny = a (possible) medical exam but a definite thermal scanning and Q&A session prior to proceeding to immigration counter.Sorry to hear of your displeasure. Best to call the Sarawak Immigration Office (office hours @ GMT +8) as their answers will be absolute.
"Here's some guidelines from MOH ;moh.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/2019-ncov-wu…Stopover at Hong Kong airport is not considered as being in China. You'll be asked about 4 main symptoms ; fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath.If you're healthy you should be good for entry medical wise.Edited: 9:46 am, February 23, 2020 "
You will be checked (health etc) in Kuala Lumpur which should make the Sarawak checks easier - more of a formality.
"I promised I should post an update when I got a reply from the Sarawak Tourism board.The 'assistant manager - communications"" of Sarawak Tourism replied the following:""Transit (in HK) is alright to come in to Malaysia. Since you will be arriving in Kuala Lumpur and spending 3 nights there, it should be okay to come in to Sarawak. Regards"" I guess we will be OK to go... (that's if they don't decide to cancel our flights to HK, like they have done with many others...)"
Enjoy your trip to Sarawak!
"You will enjoy Sarawak - but, not wanting to put a downer on your trip, please be prepared for checks in Kuching airport - communication between government departments is not what it could be.Left Hand / Right hand if you get my drift."
