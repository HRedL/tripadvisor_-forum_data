my husband and i will be heading to PC this week should i keep thinking about the cholera outbreak near porta prince in haiti ??? my husband says no but.....
...... What are you thinking about ?PeaceLea
If you think it's going to effect you're holiday no.
"Lea makes a good point....The outbreak is in Haiti. Although we share a large island, it is rare when a situation on one end of the island effects the other. Not impossible, but not likely.Last night I received a notification from the Canadian Embassy (a service for expats) about the situation in Haiti. It's only advise was to avoid travel to Haiti at this time.Like other incidents localized to areas of the island, the offshore cable media will paint everything with the same brush, thus leading to fear and misunderstandings. Happens all too often.Those at the biggest threat (and that risk is small at best) are us who live here. Thus If we are packing our bags, you know the real scoop.Until then....life goes on as usual here...despite the occurrences elsewhere on the island.CheersPuntaCana Mike"
"Mike's correct … you are on the other side of the island …. Its important to check the destination you are traveling to so that you are aware of your location and how things that are occurring in other countries may affect you...In this particular case, you have zero to little chance of being affectedHowever, I'm sure you are just as saddened by another life changing event for Haitians …Enjoy your vacation PeaceLea"
"In all cases like this, I believe it is important to understand how cholera spreads, it is not airborne or contact like influenza, Cholera is a bacteria that lives in contaminated drinking water. Cholera produced severe diarrhea and vomitting which leads to electrolyte loss IF LEFT UNTREATED. The poor people of Haiti have little or no sanitation, and have very little access to medical care, thus they are dying of the dehydration associated with the diarrhea from the cholera bacteruim. Since the resorts have their own water systems, there is virtually no possible way that you can contact Cholera, but should you travel off the resorts, and ingest infected food or water I am sure you would access health care, some intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Something the people of Haiti can not do!"
Even still - a very good question to post. Thank you to the poster and those with insightful responses. Very helpful.
"Cholera is a bacteria in unfiltered water. Any time we travel to the islands I always take the following precautions. Most hotels have filtered water. Do not brush your teeth with the water from the lavatory. Always use bottled water. Do not drink water out side of the resort unless it is bottled and make sure to always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is not a new disease just coming to this area, it has always been there. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Chlorea makes people very dehydrated and this is what is dangerous. It can cure itself with plenty of fluids or a person might need antibiotics. Remember this is an out break in Haiti because of all the distruction from the earth quake. That does not mean it is something new to the area. You should take these precautions any time you leave your country.Edited: 9 years ago "
"As I would tend to agree with your statement...the outbreak started in a area isolated from the earthquake devistation. As I mentioned...this is where the cable media tend to simplify issues well beyond their scope and rely on basic information and with that...on a local scale...come out looking like fools.Haiti is the western wold's most impoverished nation in present day terms. The outbreak has little to do with the aftermath of February's earthquake, but more another chapter in what happens when we let a country go to waste.The disease is migrating through human migration from one area to another. As there is little in the way of medical support outside of the capital region, thus those with symptoms are migrating to where help can be found, thus complicating the issue at hand in the Puerto Principe area.I know there will be those who over react, mainly due to ignorance ( i do not mean that in a bad way). But keep in mind...you are traveling to the Dominican Republic...not Haiti. As mentioned in a previous post...if there was a local threat...many of us (including myself and family) would be on the next plane out. I have no reason to leave.CheersPCMike"
My wife is a very experienced Nurse Consultant with a Master of Health Sciences Degree and practicing in the long term care field.She says the problem-if it eventually reaches the PC resorts-will likely come from the spray on the food in the restaurants--eg salads.--as well as in the handling of food by employees in the kitchen who may have washed their hands using tap water.Neither of us is quite sure just how far a particular Resort's 'filtration system' actually extendsWe're booked at IBB for Feb and are still planning to go now that we have paid...IBB probably concerns us a lot less than some of the lower level resorts but our gut feel is that to think 'there is close to no risk' is perhaps a bit on the optimistic side.She also says it is far too early to tellEdited: 9 years ago 
"Can you elaborate on "" spray on the food""? What kind of spray?"
things like lettuce are usually washedmany guests of resorts try and make an effort to not sample the lettuce just to be on the safe side--or any other item that might have been washed beforehand--eg cold carrots----Higher end resorts probably are safer--eg we have confidence in IberostarEdited: 9 years ago 
Can you tell me what produce we recieve from Haiti???CheersPCMike
"No disrespect meant at all hereFrom what I've read, a significant % of Resorts' employees in PC are some generation of Haitian as I understand it, many of whom have relatives or friends back home or who temporarily house visitors from Haiti...I agree that the resorts likely do not import produce from Haiti. My thoughts were transfer related originating from water supply not necessarily on the resort. The initial genisis of a water transfer on resort might be far removed from the resort itself---several permutations come to mindfor example can a cholera victim visit her brother in PC looking for refuge and cause the brother's water supply to become infected when the sister re-washes her hands at her brother's non-filtrated flat--and the brother then leaves for work at a resort and then re-transfers into the resort's water supply once inside---Haven't the faintest ideathe chain would likely take quite some time to form if it was at all potent and I would imagine that very few PC residents would have any knowledge of a potential chain at this point as it is far too early.no disrespect meant to the haitian community here-the entire situation is tragic many times overI also realize that this subject is quite likely going to be met with disdain by PC locals. It would be human nature to think of irrational tourists as simply fear mongerers--yet when it comes to health who knows where the original trigger came from or how.We went to a resort in LaRomana at the height of the initial earthquake news & we are returning to Bavaro Beach soon amidst the cholera news. It is times like these that we sometimes feel self conscious being a tourist when there is much obvious suffering going on in Haiti (which I once briefly visited years ago)Edited: 9 years ago "
"Stop fretting, in the entire country we have one case confirmed and three unconfirmed. The confirmed case is in santo Domingo and is in hospital as we speak, the others are in Santiago and moca in the north but unconfirmed. It really isn't worth bothering your mind over."
"I understand what you are saying ion. The resorts...in fact the whole community is being made aware of the issue and acting in a proactive manner, with training sessions at the workplace, community meetings in the barrios and posters posted in prime locations in both Spanish and Creole explining the issues and how each individual can decrease the risk.The community here is very concerned about the issues currently effecting Haiti. Resorts are taking extra measures with staff hygiene, water and cleanliness. This was no different than last year with the Swine flu.CheersPCMike"
Thank you so very much for your very intelligent explanation!
"hand hygiene is the thing, and I have witnessed spa workers only rinsing their hands after exiting the stalls and have read reports of others witnessing bar staff of the same................so the resorts really need to re educate their staff on hand hygiene. that said my hospitals infection control people reportedly said that to effectively clean your hands you need to wash for 2 min. who does that? they prefer hand sanitizer unless your hands are obviously dirty as the hand sanitizer does it in 15 sec"
"I think any tourist has to use common sense when traveling anywhere. We take hand sanitizers with us where ever we go. If any of those reading have done a cruise you know what I mean. You have to see a Norwalk outbreak on a ship. The buffet lines on a ship are a joke. Some use hand sanitizers when going in and others don't as they have them outside the door for all passengers. Then watch folks pick up food with fingers and then put it back. My wife is an nurse and she yells at these people to either eat it or throw it out, thanks. She is polite when doing so. Railings on a ship are a great spot to transmit infections and one should just be aware.Will be in the DR in a couple of months and the Nurse (DW) is gung ho to go..."
"Hand washing time should equal 15-20 seconds - whether you are using soap and water or the alcohol based hand rubs. Just enough time to sing ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" or ""Happy Birthday"". We prefer the alcohol based rubs because they are more convienient therefore people are more likely to use them.A two minute hand wash was the standard back in the day - but now even pre operatively, the surgeons and OR nursing staff are using the alcohol based rubs. I love hearing ""Twinkle Twinkle"" as I walk by the banos LOLC"
"To add to bugs advice.....Get your paper towel first, wash your hands, dry them and then use the paper towel to shut off the sink handle AND open the door to exit.... lotta yucky stuff on those sink handles and door knobs.... the whole hand washing thing is a total waste of time if you are picking back up the same (if not worse) germs from those spots...Happy Hand Washing!PeaceLeaEdited: 9 years ago "
"Absolutely, Lea!!!! Well said......don't forget those nasty sink and door handles!!!!!. One other thing. This has little to do with Cholera, but when you cough or sneeze and you do not have a tissue or towel, simply catch the cough or sneeze into the bend/crook of the inside of your elbow. Keeps from contaminating your hands or yourself depending on what you last touched. My kids are 4, 6 , 10 and even they have better hand washing hygiene and restaurant manners than many adults. Proud Momma here :-)"
"just enjoy your vacation and forget about problems! in any tropical country there are some desease. i've been in Africa for 4 years and there are much more problems...but! in this order of ideas it's better to stay closed in your house and never go out, because a piano could fall from the fourth floor!!"
"This is our first trip to PC, we go in February. We decided to switch from Cancun/Playa (we have been there 20 plus times) due to all the drug problems in Mexico and to support a different locale. Hopefully this will not be an issue, we have traveled all over the Caribbean and never once been ill in 25 years. We will be at the Palace/Hard Rock since we are Palace members and fully believe they are on top of this. Our prayers for the people of Haiti, they deserve better.Be safe,Joanne"
yes good common sence should always be no 1 !!! i must say i always look forward to my down south vacations...i have a cough that is awful that no one ever gets that i know anyways n the drs have told me for yrs that its asthma related n the cold weather does me in every oct or nov ...yup day 2 of my holiday it totally dissapears ...but until then people look at me when i cough like i have the plague lol...so r holiday isnt goin to come soon enuf ;)n hats off to those well mannered knowledgeable kids n their momma too ;)!!! 2 mths n 27 days tick tock tick tock ........
Just read on-line today that Dominican Republic got its first cholera case. …time.com/2010/…
"so does florida,,, it reported its first case"
Dominican case was confirmed yesterday. This thread has been closed now but plenty of information on there. tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147293-i28-k405…Edited: 9 years ago 
"About wc's and handles on toilest:I was last week at a shopping mall in Santo Domingo where they had new wc's and doors installed. I loved that the flush is operated by foot, on the fllor, ans so was the open-close gate and closage system. So you don't touch absolutelly nothing you don't really want to touch....Considering that most letal viruses are transmitted through physical contact, ALL public toilest in mayor public, airports, malls, etc, should be MANDATORY to be like this."
"We're not too worried about cholera a outbreak in Punta Cana area. The potential of it is there, although in my opinion it's low. We will be taking dukoral for cholera and chloroquine for malaria. Better to be safe than sorry.Happy Travels,Skipper"
"Been away for a day or two due to internet connection issues! Just a heads up on the local situation from the source.....no downplaying nor hyping up.There are few here who are not aware of the situation in Haiti and that of the confirmed case yesterday. That being said, I cannot think of anyone who is living their life in fear, nor changing their day to day life. Being aware does not mean over reacting. I have not yet recieved any information from the Canadian Government to distribute to fellow Canadians residing here in regards to local concerns.When we say things like ""outbreak"" and then mention Punta Cana in the same line, we are misleading the readers of these posts...many of whom wrongly jump to conclusions based on the headers of the topic at hand.Yes...the potential for islolated cases exists...but the reality is that if in fact it did touch the community, it is highly unlikely that it would be a concern to those vacationing here.The media over the past 20 years...since the invention of 24 hour news, has been quick to mis-report issues around the world, basing many reports on speculation and 2nd hand knowledge. Be it SARS in Canada, swine flu in Mexico (remember that...we were all going to die???) bird flu, uncapped oil spills in America and who knows what...we are quick to over react. Images work both ways...I can take 2 pictures for the same story. One is positive...one negative...and I can use which ever to sway the public in the direction the media wishes.So to summerize, there is no business nor resident here that is not well aware of the potential (but unlikely) of this issue and we are taking proactive measures to lessen the already small chance of anything occuring. As I once said about hurricanes...if you see me leaving, then we are indeed in for a rough ride...I am not a hero...I know when to say goodbye. I can leave any day I wish, along with my family.My bags are empty.If anything locally does occur, I will do my best to tell it like it is. Some will discredit me as being a local with business interests here.,,,,so be it if you wish to do so. If there was a legitimate risk I would not ever put you or my family at risk.But what you do not factor into your insinuation is that my family comes first and if there was a legitimate danger, I would be the first one out.CheersPCMike"
