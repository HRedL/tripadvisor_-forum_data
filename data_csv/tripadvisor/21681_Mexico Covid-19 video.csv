Mexico in grave danger. Thank you for the video links.What is wrong the the Mexican President?https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/26/mexico-m…
"I hope the Mexican people are preparing and being careful, I hope the normal busloads won't be arriving to Huatulco for the holiday, that would be a disaster"
"At this point in time, realizing the toll Covid-19 has on Italy. The prediction is Mexico will be decimated by the lack of defensive action.Mexico will see doom."
"It will be interesting to see what happens to Mexico. They are potentially going to pay a very high price in deaths due to COVID, but the duration of it will likely be much shorter. Only time will tell what the best approach is."
Wow! Thanks for your well wishes to us!
So how is AMLO's response in Mexico different from Trump's response in the USA?
"The US is doing lots of testing, and Mexico is doing essentially none."
"Hello The president in Mexico has down played the entire crisis. He even states that the poor in Mexico are immune.Here is news from a Mexico news source.https:/…All countries are urging their citizens to get out of Mexico. Be safe RegardsEdited: 4:10 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"Pat Y that was the governor of Puebla, not AMLO."

"This opinion piece video is contentious and biased. It's been making its rounds on this forum and other places. The content is dated and the situation is different now. We're on Phase II of the contingency, very far from those days when the content was created, but more than anything, people need to realize that the president doesn't dictate policy, he's the Executive. It's the Health Secretary who takes those decisions. Our president is controversial, yes. He usually speaks to his base, just like your president. It's tricky posting political arguments in a travel forum even when travel is affected, like at the present situation, but if you care to raise an argument then my take is that he's playing other people like a fiddle, making them speak up and then switching policy making them look like fools, like in this case.Last but not least, it plays well making people afraid to come to this country from areas of higher infection, which at the moment I find beneficial. Stay safe out there."
"I flew into to Mexico City on 3/13 on my way to Hux. I flew back same route on 3/19. Looking at the density of Mexico City and the differences in poverty, health care, communication etc I thought this city is in for an epidemic of incredible proportions. I have reservations for late June and early July for Oaxaca City and Mexico City. Hope this has run its course and Mexico does ok with this virus. One thing for sure is testing is very limited so the numbers reported need to be considered with a grain of salt but a bag of salt!."
"HelloWith the devastation in Italy, information available with the continuous nonchalant urgency, lack of organization and supplies in Mexico. And with predictions Mexico will be much worse than Italy. Tourism travel to Mexico will not gain any slight momentum for at least 24 months. We have to factor in United States and Canada government strict warnings and restrictions. New imposed Covid-19 insurance coverage exclusions. If your health insurance private or federal excludes coverage when traveling to Mexico, will you still go? The United States and Canada may restrict airlines to operate in a tourism capacity or not allow aircraft to land in Mexico if there is Covid-19 hot spots. They do not want it to come back to their country.Tourism is not a essential service. Rest assured countries federal governments, insurance companies, airlines are going completely out of their minds with rewriting every aspect with policy. To protect their country, business, and economy’s. Movement and travel is the primary component with is outbreak.Ask yourself, when was the last time your country’s ambassador to Mexico told you to get out of Mexico. Looking forward to be back in Huatulco in 2 years. Hopeful.RegardsBe safe"
"""Ask yourself, when was the last time your country’s ambassador to Mexico told you to get out of Mexico.""Well to be fair, US State Department has a wide span of Mexico on their permanent ""Do Not Travel"" list and most countries are repatriating their citizens, including Mexico. Guess you won't be visiting for at least two years, give us your blessing cause according to your predictions most of us will not survive. Ah well c'est la vie...Edited: 11:58 pm, March 30, 2020 "
I do not think it will be two years. We should have a vaccine in 1 1/2 years. Better treatment options sooner I suspect. We have a flight in late June to Oaxaca City than to Mexico City. Interjet is only allowing changes through 5/31/2020 but I suspect this will change soon and I can cancel my flights. I am hoping for November 2020 in Huatulco. Time will tell!
"Quite so, John. we have chosen to stay in Huatulco and feel quite safe...much safer than had we returned anywhere north at this point in time when the health systems are overwhelmed.The Mexican Federal, State and Local governments have implemented the ""call for safety"", especially so in Huatulco: stay at home, social distancing, how to disinfect, and protect the elderly, children, and folks with cardio/pulmonary problems.Thank God for the goodness of local folks and YOU who are up North who are donating to the charities here that are feeding anyone who needs sustenance. Thank you for your kindness.CH"
"I just few out of there 3/19/20. I really thought school closed and I could spend 2 more weeks on the beach. The thought did occur to me what if one needed emergency medical cars such as a ventilator. Would you be out of luck as not part of Mexico's public health care system, or is there access to great private medical care such as in places like San Luis Potosi, Mexico City, Merida? I would probably take my chances in Huatulco especially looking at New York and stay close to the condo. I worker my part time job 3/28-29 at our local hospital and there were several isolation pts but no positives that I saw. (But I only see pts that require intervention by a registered and licensed dietitian/nutritionist.) We will see how the stay at home orders affect the curve of the virus locally and around the world."
"I too am hoping for a late summer (August or September) trip to Mexico; where is still up in the air. I am hoping this virus won't do as well in surviving during the hotter summer months, much like the annual (Winter) flu viruses each year. Only time will tell. Stay healthy. ¡Diviertanse!"
