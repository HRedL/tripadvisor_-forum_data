"It's no surprise that many restaurants are going to have to do things differently to survive. I doubt any of us will be able to keep up with all the rapid changes over the next few months and it will be harder for us locals to offer solid info on what's still available without doing a lot of research. In just the last couple days, I've read about Fat Rice reconcepting to meal kits and grocery items ""for the foreseeable future"", Toast permanently closing and Mindy's Hot Chocolate transforming into a bakery.Rather than coming up w/ a long unwieldy list of places that remain open, the new normal should be to call or check a restaurant's website to see if they are still open for eat-in.CV"
Or just make a reservation?When things open up.B.
"Yes, of course, if a place accepts reservations, then making a res. normally means they are open. Altho... I used OpenTable one time to make a res at Tesori near Symphony Center and arrived to discover it was closed due to the Symphony being on strike."
Not a fan of open table. Similar things have happened to me.B.
"I’ve never had a problem with open table. Perhaps the problem you experienced was with the restaurant? CV, Tesori closed because the Symphony was on strike? What about their other patrons like you? I’d cross Tesori off my list and tell them why! I’m longing for a well cooked fish entree at Eataly - but - it’s not going to be until I feel safe. What’s more, It’s going to cost the restaurants $$$ to reopen. With fewer patrons and social distancing they’re not going to be profitable.Edited: 6:33 pm, April 30, 2020 "
"Alinea is selling at least $45,000 worth of to go meals a day.That is quite the reconcept. B."
Boo- 700 meals a day? Are you serious? Wow.
"at least 750 - actually. According to Achatz.B.Edited: 8:01 pm, April 30, 2020 "
That's the winning pivot of the lockdown. Good for him.
"There's not much else to spend money on, so maybe enjoy a nice meal?"
"Coincidentally, my wife and I had the duck confit cassoulet from Alinea today. We ordered it a couple days ago, for pickup at 4pm. There were two cars in front of us when we pulled up, they got it to us in less than a minute...and three cars pulled in behind us during that time.We shared the order, which also had a mixed greens salad, green beans, and a banana cream tart. With tax and tip it was around $60, not too bad at all, all things considered (the cassoulet and salad were excellent, green beans are green beans, and dessert was OK).So yeah as surprising as that sounds (selling 750+ per day) , I believe it. Their pickup options for early May are ossu buco, which I think they've been doing all along, and a 6 course meal that is more ""chef-y"" than what they've done so far.Interesting article about the pivot (published Apr 1 so some things may have changed): https:/…2247811Hope all you folks are doing OK during this time..."

"""Alinea is selling at least $45,000 worth of to go meals a day""Of wow! Is it worth just getting the food without the experience though?"
The 2-go food costs $50pp or so depending on what you order. Dinner in the restaurant is $250pp+. Apples and Oranges.B.
"I talked to some Chefs about that Grubhub invoice and it is real but very, very extreme. On average Grubhub takes about 30% from restaurants. (that receipt was 70%). Either way don't order from grub hub.B."
"We’re only doing restaurants out our way with contactless pickup. I’ve never been to Alinea, so maybe this is my chance..."
We also got the duck cassoulet from Alinea last weekend. At only about $60pp tax and tip included it was pretty reasonable. Certainly not the experience of eating in.

"1200 in one day!Carryout — with no delivery — has worked extremely well for the Alinea Group. Best known for its premium-priced restaurants Alinea and Next, the group pivoted to curbside service in March, supplying prepackaged meals (including heating and serving instructions) at prices ranging from $24.95 to $50 per person. Customers prepay for the meals via the Tock To Go website, drive to the pickup spot at the appointed time (times are staggered, much like restaurant reservations) and pop open their trunk. Expediters place the food in the car. No muss, no fuss, no contact. A recent offering of coq au vin, said co-owner Nick Kokonas, sold 1,200 orders in one day."
"""The 2-go food costs $50pp or so depending on what you order.""Then that is a good deal actually!"
"We have eaten at Alinea once -- the tickets are like rock concert or opera tickets super expensive -- but the 16 or so course meal is a performance and worth it once -- but we can't afford to go backAnd now they are doing take out. We had their duck cassoulet meal (with haricort vert almondine, a shaved beet, greens and goat cheese salad, lovely roll and banana cream tart with chocolate sauce) for my birthday for 46 a head. We also got the paired wine which was a riesling which I normally don't like and we always serve red with cassoulet -- but it was perfect -- just very good. We have now ordered their 15th anniversary 6 course meal; the main course is a short rib prep. The provide the meal well packaged to reheat and with detailed instructions.It is very tasty stuff and good value at these prices. They do have a 20% service fee so that 50 dollar 6 course meal is 60 bucks. Still worth it.I can't image we will eat IN a restaurant this year or until there is a vaccine -- and there is genuine doubt that a vaccine will every be available.We are also ordering from Edouardo Enoteca in our neighborhood and Riccardo Trattoria. All these places are also well organized for picking up meals. We avoid grub hub and such because of their obscene fees to the restaurants. It is easy to pull up to Alinea and have your meal handed through the window.Paulinamarket.com. A wonderful independent butcher shop is also doing well organized non contact orders. You sign up for the food and the time of pick up on line and then call when you arrive and they hand it through the window.We need to find a good fish market and we are set.We are trying to do take out once a week to support local restaurants trying to survive.Edited: 4:44 pm, May 03, 2020 "

"+ 1 for Dirk's Fish! We go every Saturday. It's a small place and at present only 8 customers are allowed in the store at a time, so a line forms outside sometimes. They also do pre-orders where they will have an employee run out to the parking lot and hand the merchandise off, tho we have never seen anyone actually do that.In addition to fresh fish and shellfish, they have some house-made frozen soups, chowders, fish salads and spreads. We've tried a lot of it and like most of it.Edited: 6:32 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Dave148,You beat me to it, recommending Dirk's. Been going there pretty much weekly for the 14 years or so he's been on Clybourn, and for years before that when he was on North Ave (as a Burhop's).It's a small store, right now they are only allowing 5 people in the store at one time. It is very likely you will have to wait a bit. Hours are 10am-5pm now I think, they are also doing phone orders and curbside delivery. They still have a decent variety of fish, though not quite as wide as before. They also have frozen options, and have also started selling grocery staples like milk, cheese, and eggs (they had always sold a few veggies, various pastas, and sauces)."
Chains will be open as well!
"Oh yeah, Paulina Market is a great place. Good info on the fish market."
