Anyone have a successful experience trying to get a refund from JAL for an upcoming flight due to coronavirus concerns in Japan?
Japan doesn't have an epidemic going on like in mainland China so why would they refund you?If the situation does get a lot worse they will probably offer voluntary refunds.
My sister's husbands work has said if he goes he will have to stay in quarantine for 2 weeks when he returns. So they have canceled their trip. They were flying on a different airline and used miles so they aren't out money. I wont go on the trip alone.
You should contact JAL customer service directly because the situation here is changing (not for the better) day by day. Japan actually does have a problem due to the corona virus so maybe they will do something for you.

"@kobekeith no one said that there isn't a problem. However, it is not an epidemic at this stage.You make it sound like there has been hundreds of deaths. The reality is that we don't know what will happen even a month from now.Edited: 3:40 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"I never said anything about deaths. Stop grasping. I’ve used the saying “it’s business as usual” here in Japan in many of my posts about the epidemic. Things have changed and are changing daily. I’m booked for two back to back trips leaving Japan on March 15 & I’m waiting to see how things are going. This thread is about a person who is already determined to cancel her trip and needs help with it. If I were her, I would contact the airline directly and speak (nicely) to a supervisor about the situation. I would point out that the quarantine of the ship was a failure and it has been reported as such by medical professionals who were there. I’d also point out my concern about the thousands of Japanese passengers who were allowed to just leave that cruise ship and are now mixed in with the population. I would tell JAL that I’m also concerned with the fact that there are empty shelves in stores and people living in Japan cannot get things and play on that paranoia that may seem irrational to others on the outside but this is the reality of what’s starting to happen here. 80% of all Japanese tourists booked for trips to Thailand have cancelled their trips. Whereas only 20% of Thai tourists have cancelled their bookings to Japan. That’s the feeling in Japan. Yes, more people die from influenza every year and other diseases and people can continue to Google rational statistics from their homes thousands of miles away but that’s not going to change the feelings of the local people and their nervousness or paranoia that’s starting to take hold. I said on another thread that public schools are starting to put together official plans addressing the possibility that all schools will be closed. I would also point that out to the JAL supervisor. Last month, 15 out of 40 students in one of my classes were absent for a week due to influenza. Overall, there were over 100 students out of 1,100 students absent. That didn’t close down the school. That didn’t cause panic. That didn’t empty the shelves in stores. But this epidemic is causing those things to happen. No one in Kōbe has corona virus right now but everything is sold out. Maybe that sounds crazy to people thousands of miles away but that’s what’s going on. I’m on my train now and some people are wearing masks and a few are not. People are still going to work. Businesses are still running. I’ve never said people are dropping like flies here.Edited: 4:17 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"@kobekeith That's why I said ""you make it sound like"" I didn't claim that you talked about deaths.I live in Canada and there are no cases in my city, why should the people of Kobe in the same situation be paranoid? (We also get many Chinese tourists.) It is irrational to worry about something that may never happen.Also, realize that you just wrote a novel length post explaining your fears. That should make you realize that you're perhaps worrying a bit too much."
"Boy, you really don’t know Japan at all. LolCanada is a big country. Wakayama, Nara, Osaka and Kyōto are not too far from Kōbe and there are people with the virus in those cities. But maybe I can relay the message to the 1.5 million people in Kōbe to tell them that some random person in Canada about 10,000 kilometers away said that they shouldn’t worry about anything. Maybe the City Hall and Board of Education are being too paranoid too so I’ll let them know that Jay from TripAdvisor thinks they don’t need to worry about anything. Maybe the millions of people panic shopping will listen to Jay and the shelves will no longer be empty. Phew. The Level 1 Travel advisory from the CDC for American citizens traveling to japan telling people to “practice usual precautions” is probably an overreaction too. Please contact them to give them your advice from Toronto. Nip it in the bud."
"Thank you, your reply is most helpful. Was going to visit my niece who is doing her junior year abroad in Tokyo and there is even talk that those students may be sent home in The future."
"Japan is Watch Level 1 per CDC as of today, so have a good chance of getting your flight cancelled with no fee:https:/…coronavirus-japanPlease let s know how it goes."
Thank you!
">>Dr S, is ""Watch Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions"" dire enough to get airlines (specifically United) to cancel flights?<<I don't think airlines cancel flights unless it becomes ""Warning Level 3""."
"Watch Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions sounds alarming, so I get to investigate a little bit more and I found this:https:/…Please search for any other country you think is safe to travel and most likely you'll see a Level 1 warning due to another reasons not related to coronavirus. So, in my opinion, we should keep an eye on this warning level but right now there is not enough reason for airlines to give refunds because of a flight to Japan (unless you have any insurance and read well the terms and conditions)."
I successfully canceled my flight for March 11th today with JAL for free. It is possible.
"@15 . Did they ask you the reason? Any surcharge for cancellation?Edited: 2:40 am, February 22, 2020 "
"All the airlines' cancellation and change fee waivers are route specific. So you need to focus on your particular route. JAL had been quite nice to allow refunds on routes to and from Hong Kong even when they did not cancel the actual flights. (I don't know if they still fly that route, because I stopped checking once I got my refund through AA.)You can check their latest alerts here:https:/…index.html"
