"With the cholera epidemic in Haiti in the news so much lately, has anyone heard of it showing up in DR, especially La Romana area? We will be there last week of Dec. and are concerned. Thanks."
"Stop worrying.There is as much Cholera in La Romana or DR, as there is is Canada...."
"As far as I know, the border between Haiti and Dominican Republic is closed. Denise"
"Its not closed really. There is a bit of confusion about whats going on there, and the foreign news are saying that the border is closed, but thas not true. but the border is defenetelly not closed.What is is closed is the ""Mercado Bicional"", which is a market place n the frontier, where both dominicans and haitians buy-sell watever they have to offer, specially country produce and chicken.Because of the cholera, this market place has been closed down and today the news are that the haitian sellers are really angry and demanding the reopening of the market. Yesterdat they burnt many truck from dominicans, full of live chicken, and they have threateh to start burning the truck.sThey say that if haitinas cannot sell to dominicans, dominicanss cannot sell to haitians either.They don't really care for the epidemy precautons, All they want is to sell.But Dominicans autorities (and UNO) are very clear with these, and the frontier will remain CLOSED FOR BUSINESS.As for people, the border is open buty everysingle person crossing including the cars, are being desinfected before entering Dominican side.Passanger buses are stopped though."
"HiWe are thinking of holidaying in Dominican in May 2011 and have reservations about the Cholera, weather and earthquake. Have you any advise before i book.Wewant to go to the Sirenis Tropical Suites, Casino & Spa"
"We arrived back 4 days ago & before we left we too were concerned about cholera. When we were there, there was never any mention of it from locals or travellers. We stayed at Gran Bahia La Romana, so can't comment on your hotel."
"I haven't heard about any new cases of malaria in DR, all cases that were detected in DR were at villages by the Haitian border where tourist don't go to. Your resort is in Punta Cana, the farthest location from Haitian border.For the weather updates, please post a question on Punta Cana forum, La Romana / Bayahibe is on the south coast about hour and half from Punta Cana area and the weather might be a bit different then on the east. I post everyday weather update for Bayahibe on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/discoverbayahibeAnd the earthquake - if you are talking about the one that was in Haiti last year, we didn't feel anything then, there were no damages in Dominican republic. Happy travelDenise"
"Two people from Boston just returned from a vacation in Casa de Campo, La Romana and were tested positive for cholera..It was on the news here in Boston."
They have a thread for that . . . tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g147293-i28-k42041â€¦Embeded in that conversation is the link to the other cholera post
"Many posts have been posted on different threads on TA or any other travel forums. It's sad that it happened, but important thing to remember is it did not happen at any resort, it was a private wedding party at a private villa. Probably the people from Boston were part of the wedding party. And as said on many posts, the lobsters came from the Haiti border and most of the lobsters at the resorts do not come from here. There is not enough of them to support all the resorts all the time.Denise"
"I actually found amazing what happened at Casa de Campo.....But we have to realize that It was a private wedding, at a private villa (not resort), with a private chef (not the Hotel'slor the resort's chefs), and actually one of the most famous wedding chefs there is in the country.So, the bride and groom and their families, NOT DOMINICAN, decide to choose a menu that serves LOBSTER CEVICHE (raw slices of lobster ""cooked"" or ""macerated"" in lemon and vinegar)...... in a moment like this........ Who's to blame??? At firts I though the bride (and motherLOL) where to blame for choosing that specific menu at a moment like this where we are fed up of hearing that fish and seafood has to be COOKED in orer to kill the bacteria!!!!. But they were foreignesr, so, In my opinion, the CHEF, who's someone with lots of experience, and has prepared the best weddings in this country, but I think he made two huge mistakes:1. Not considering his choice procedence of the Lobster and seafood, Pedernales, in the border with Haiti, which might be known to be the biggest provider province for lobster and seafoof for Hotels all over Dominican Republic....BUT.... 2) Choosing, or at least agreeing, to serve it RAW. Huge mistake in a moment like this.... same lobsters cooked probably wouln't have had any problems!!! In fact, two weeks before there was a wedding at Dominicus, permormed by the very same chef, with lobster served, and nothing happened!!!! (lobster was cooked here though....). Who knows????Now.... whats not fair is the fact thana many people are blaming Casa de Campo for this, when Casa de Campo had absolutelly nothing to do with this matter!!!"
"Hi we are booked to go on March 18, 2011 to Iberostar Hasienda Raromana ,DR. I am a little scared after latest news.Edited: 9 years ago "
"there is no reason at all to be afraid.That case was an isolated case, on a private house, witha private chef.My father in law ownes a place within minutes distance from the actual house where it happened, and I guarantee you that none of us or anyone I know is worried.After you get here, you'll see that you wont even think about Cholera"
thank you I hope everything will be fine.
We just came back from the Gran Bahia Principe in La Romana and over 75% of those at the resort became very ill. Check TravelAdvisors for this resort and you can read all about. It disappointing TravelAdivisors is not posting all messages.
What does getting ill have to do with Cholera?????How did you arrive at your numbers????What kind or ill????Why start rumors?????BObK
"I'm not spreading rumours. As I said go to TripAdivisors for the Gran Bahia Principe La Romana and see for yourself. Three of four of our family had serious vomiting, diarrhea and nausea for three days. The medical office at the resort was packed. I did a count at the airport and took room numbers of those ill. Perhaps you don;t care about the health of others. I do and it should be reported. It is yet to be determined if it is cholera or a virus. Bottom line is people are huge #'s are getting seriously ill.Here is another TripAdisor report from a report from another resort nearby""Guests at a wedding at Casa de Campo in La Romana have cholera, contracted from eating lobster. Six people from Massachusetts have confirmed cases. Over 100 guests from Venezuela that attended the wedding also have it.There were guests from USA, Mexico and Venezuela in attendance at the wedding. Report states those with cholera have been treated at hospitals in US, DR and Venezuela"""
the wedding was several months ago - no traveller related cholera here in Ontario.Sound more like a virus . . . now that is circulating widely in the province and travels very nicely to resorts.C
"Some reviews say food poisoning, some say great food, some say not insects others say 100 insect bites. And it's interesting that all these people were there at the same time :)We have not heard about any new cholera case in Dominican republic for a long time.Happy travelDenise"
"The last info is as of March 20...anything new since, about Cholera in DR la Romana?Edited: 9 years ago "
None there is none for you to worry about and if you need further info try going to the Medical websites not a travel website.
"The situations has been the same.They were some cases by Haiti border, all under control. I haven't heard any problems at any resorts in Dominican Republic.Happy travelDenise"
