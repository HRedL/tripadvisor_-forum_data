"#1 a of interstate travelers permit, needs negative result 72 hours from departure. Does anyone know for sure if Covid-19 rapid tests results are exceptable or just the PCR test which takes sveral days to get results back?."
Please look through the thread on here. Lots of info on that. It needs to be PCR. Rapid does not mean it is either PCR or not PCR.

We found a rapid test location that was a PCR so it was sufficient for our trip this week. Just ask the testing facility if it is PCR.
"Still conflicted on if we should go ( early Aug.). I think I can work out testing. However Delta changed my direct flights to 1 stop, thus more exposure to people. We are doing everything we can to stay safe but as everyone knows CV-19 is really rising. Thanks for posts they have helped."
"Southern, Delta cancelled our direct flight as well. Now laying over in Seattle both ways. Also early august. Wonder if we were on the same flight! lolWe are still going!"
"We are going August 13-19 and trying to decide how safe it will be ON the airplane, with the air circulating we are wondering if it is the same air over and over. On a shorter flight it may not be a concern but we are coming from OK. How safe do you believe it to be while we are in flight?"
I am not sure how many doctors are on the Alaska forum. I think that would be best answered by an internet search on your own. It's kind of like when people ask about Visa requirements for different places. You don't want to rely on an anonymous internet forum for such advice.
"""How safe do you believe it to be while we are in flight?""- the virus is contagious & it is airborne (for more than just 6 ft).I personally do not feel like getting into a large locked room, that recycles air, with a couple hundred strangers."
Where did you get rapid PCR. I’m in Chattanooga and have not found anyone doing rapid PCR. Would drive 2 or 3 hrs to get it just to have results getting in AK.
"I have read that the do not recirculate the old air, they bring in fresh air. That being said, we will be wearing n95 masks and I will sanitize our seats with wipes. We will also use sanitizer frequently."
"Just yesterday there was a bit on, I think, CNN about how the cabin air on most major airlines recirculates every 3-4 minutes and as it recirculates it is mixed over and over with outside air and goes through HEPA filters that are the ones used in hospitals. I'm far more worried about airports than airplanes. Various articles have said sit in a window seat during boarding and deboarding so you aren't exposed to everyone walking by in the aisle....I'd sit there anyway. Wear a mask except when drinking and eating and see if you can find a face shield that will allow you to eat and drink with it on. The fellow on the bit about cabin air said the air in the cabin is definitely cleaner than in the airport and, probably, than in your own home. Here's a link to a CDC article that has many more links in it.https:/…cabinairquality.html"
"I am so much more worried about crowds in airports, during layovers, and when having to go home. Huge long security lines, crowded boarding terminals, and the stuff I cannot control. I can clean my area on the plane, but the airports I go to are crazy busy, (OGG, HNL, SEATAC, CA), when I travel. Everyone has to decide for themselves, the risks they are willing to take. Per their own situation, and the loved ones in their bubble, that they go home to after the trip. Deb"
"We are flying in Aug 14th to the 22nd. This will be out third Dl flight since Memorial Day. Middle seats are empty on Dl and mask are required. I wouldn't worry about the plane as Dl is doing an amazing job of cleaning between flight, unlike another airline that I fly.As for Seattle, we have three legs, so social distance, mask and wash your hands and all will be fine. Enjoy your trip, our second to Alaska."

"As someone else mentioned, a Covid test by PCR can be ""rapid"" (meaning it will be done quickly) or one that may take 1-5 days (sample is shipped somewhere and/or the lab waits to run a batch of samples, not tested one-at-a-time). The difference is the flow of the laboratory and which PCR instrument is used for the test. P.S. I perform rapid PCR tests for covid."
"My family just returned from 16 days in Alaska including a 20+ hour journey home with a 7 hour layover in Anchorage and 3 hours in Seattle. We did six flights total-- round trip ATL-SEA-ANC and round trip ANC to King Salmon. The only time I felt crowded at all in an airport was King Salmon. The larger airports are still running so far below capacity that it's very easy to stay distant while waiting. In my experience, while your gate might be crowded immediately before a flight, the gate one or two down is likely vacant and you can hang there and board late. TSA was quick and easy everywhere except King Salmon. We'll hold our breath and stay out of crowds for the next week or two to avoid spreading anything we might have picked up on the way home. I'm certainly not an expert, but in general, my feeling is that my trip to the grocery store here at home this afternoon with lots of non-mask wearers felt much riskier than any of the travel situations we were in.Edited: 9:41 pm, July 12, 2020 "
Thank you. Youve helped alleviate alot of my concerns
Anne S - Did you have to test again in Alaska after 7-14 days? How many days before your departure did you test before you left home?
We are planning a trip to Alaska. Could you tell me where you found a rapid test. We are near Huntsville. Thank you
alaskatravel.com/updates has a link to places across the USA that have testing sites.
"“ You've helped alleviate alot of my concerns”- “Alaska reports 116 new COVID-19 cases, setting another record”; See: adn.com"
"We tested on Monday before our Thursday departure (within 72 hours). We were given info on testing again in 7-14 days but it was not stressed as mandatory by the screeners. Our intent was to do it when we went back through the Anchorage airport to go to King Salmon 10 days into our 16 day trip but we misjudged our travel time and did not have time to test before our flight. At that point, it was basically impossible to get tested again before we were leaving.Edited: 8:48 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"Anne S - I am from Brooks, GA and planning to go to Alaska the 18th of Aug. Can you tell me where you got your coved test done. Trying to locate a quick test before departure. Thanks"
"https:/…covid-19-testResults 24 hours after you return it to them. Test must be done Mon-Fri, Fed Ex NDA to you and back to lab"
https:/…covid-19-testThis is who we are using for our trip Aug 14th
"Craig, according to the website you will not have results back in time....7/9 update: Until recently, we had been able to deliver COVID-19 test results on average in 1-2 days from the date of sample receipt. But with significant increases in testing demand and constraints in the availability of supplies and equipment, the average time to deliver results may now be 4-6 days from when your sample is received at the lab"
I just back from a round trip to Massachusetts. Three of the 4 flights were at least 90% capacity while the remaining one was at approximately 50%. No issues.Just bring a meal for the long flights.
"mcdanagh05, which airline did you fly?"
Could you tell me where you had your rapid test done near trussville? We are close to Huntsville and I’m not sure anyone here does it. Thank you
"Dang 90% full.Is that accounting for middle seats being empty, or was the airline using that seat?I am just not that interested in flying with a bunch of strangers yet.- though I'm betting in a year, maybe two at the most, I'll be flying/traveling."
We went to Walgreens on Valleydale road in Hoover for a rapid test.
"Marty M--a family physician in Newnan did our COVID tests. They don't normally do them but I was having trouble finding a way to get my teens tested in the timeframe and reached out to them asking for advice. They checked with their lab and agreed to test us. If you have an existing relationship with a GP, I'd reach out to them and see if they can help."
Anne S - Thank you
I am sorry. This all gets so confusing. We found a rapid test to take but it is an antigen test...so that will for sure NOT be acceptable?Thanks in advance!
"No, an antigen tests is not accepted. It has to be a molecular test. This is from the frequently asked questions on the Alaska traveler information site:Alaska accepts only molecular-based tests such as the PCR tests – antibody/serology tests are not accepted.Alaska accepts results from FDA-approved home self-test swab kits. (Pixel/Everlywell/Vault/Picture Genetics)A molecular-based SARS-CoV2 test is any of a number of tests that detect the presence of viral RNA (genes), such as reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR, e.g. Cepheid GeneXpert, KIngFisher System, ABI 7500 system), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA, e.g. the Hologic Panther system), and Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification (e.g. Abbott ID-NOW). Hope this helps."
What was the location/provider for this rapid test?
"It was done at Walgreens on Golf in Des Plaines, Illinois."
"Air changes over many times an hour in a plane. The air comes from a high stage compressor bleed valve from the engine at approx 500 degrees. It passes through hepa a filter then to the cabin. Depending on the aircraft, air is turned over between 10-30 times an hour. I am an aerospace engineer before anyone ask."
And it's that frequent and filtered air exchange that helps so much in the closed environment. It's also part of a plan for safety....not much can keep you safe if you don't wear a mask and if others who may well be infected and not know it but are passing it don't wear a mask. Trying to tamp down the spread relies on each of the parts being in place. I am quite comfortable in that closed tube IF the airline requires masks and does as much social distancing as possible in a small area because of the great air filtration
"Here's a decent article on air travel an d flu/illness spreading which expounds Craig's post:https:/…contagious-illness-flu-planesI don't doubt the high quality of air movement/change; but that has nothing to do with several people in my 'space' and or touching things others have touched. Don't forget, for many AK is actually a 'long-haul' flight."
"I am a Dl frequent flyer, Diamond. They have kept the middle seat open till end of Sept, enforcing mask and clean aircraft between flights extensivly. They also pass out hand sanitizer when boarding. Key, keep hands clean and all will be great. Tine to explore America with the smaller crowds. Actually waiting to be called in as I type this for my rapid test. Arriving in Anchorage Friday evening."
