"https:/…LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — MGM Resorts International says they will be temporarily closing their buffets at ARIA, Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Luxor and Excalibur amid coronavirus concerns.The changes will go into effect on Sunday, March 15, according to their Public Relations department."
Good idea. Thanks for the info.
It's so serious they are waiting five days to do it?
"good, hopefully they will never reopen and become regular restaurants instead."

"They would'nt close them for the flu season,which kills thousands in the states,but they will close them down for this virus,which hasnt killed many at all in the states. Too much hype in the media I fear."
"EXACTLY!!! This coronavirus panic has gone too far. The flu is more prominent, yet buffets remain open throughout that season. People are crazy. But sadly, people are gross too."
"""It's so serious they are waiting five days to do it?""They figure it will take them 3 days to get rid of their green food, and 5 days to get rid of the yellow."
This is so stupid it doesn't warrant a response. So.....stupid.
It’s mostly about liability. It’s cheaper to shut things down versus dealing with multiple lawsuits from people who will claim they caught the virus at the buffet.
"The flu has saturated our population for 200 hundred years. It is estimated the it cycles through the entirety of our population over 5 times each year. COVID-19 was introduced less than a month ago. And of course there's no vaccine and are still learning how to treat it.Were COVID-19 to cycle through just once, and comparing both it's transmissibity and length of virulence to flu, and it's mortality rate, there would be over a million deaths per year.Will this happen? Hopefully not! But comparing common flu to COVID-19 is just being willfully ignorant at this point."
"Waiting 5 days is fine. College campuses in NY and elsewhere are starting to shut down on that timeline as well. Because at this point it's not about containing a known vector, it is about starting to shut down the activities that will cause it to spread more rapidly. Mitigation is the name of the game.Although I do question why buffets and not the dozens of other activities just as high risk. More a PR move really to show they're trying. I suspect it's a matter of when, not if things such as shows, pools, all restaurants follow suit."
"""But comparing common flu to COVID-19 is just being willfully ignorant at this point.""Yep."

"the symptoms of covid 19 are similar to those of a mild cold for the majority of people who have contracted it, so that skews the reported numbers. the people who are reporting it are people with the worst symptoms. nobody knows the actual mortality rate of covid 19 yet, so upstate guy is just one of the sheeple adding to the hysteria.also, i hope buffets re-open by april 5 for my trip because i don't want those people in the restaurants that i like.Edited: 3:51 am, March 11, 2020 "
"https://bit.ly/2TDuzys>>>...if there are cases which are not diagnosed – for example because they are mild or asymptomatic – then the CFR does not provide a good measure of the probability of dying from the disease. If there are a large number of undiagnosed cases, we would overestimate the probability of dying from this disease. The CFR value would be too high.The early data from China suggests that the majority of coronavirus disease cases are mild...the total number of people infected could be significantly higher than the number of diagnosed cases. If this is the case then the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the measured CFR.Early research suggests that that only around 5% of cases in China have been diagnosed and recorded<<<But that's only experts from Oxford saying stuff. Much better to be hysterical."
"The opposite is true. The official report is only confirmed tested cases. Due to lack of testing it is almost certainly far higher. No one with a cold is considered a confirmed case. Again, that's being willfully ignorant.As for the mortality rate, it may turn out lower. That'd be great! Problem is if it does turn out to be lower it'll only be because it will be because it's transmissibility turns out to be far higher. That would be terrifying. Because mortality rate is not actually fixed. The far higher percentage who become critically ill, as high as 25% for those in their 70's require intensive medical care. Including being on a ventilator for a week or two. So we'd be in danger of over-capicity. The US has 160,000 ventilators. Problem is on average half are in use. So simply put, if we don't mitigate it's spread the mortality rate will skyrocket. I am not adding to any hysteria. I am advocating reasonable measures. Such as avoiding Vegas. You want hysteria? Try being a 70 year old lying on a cot in a gym slowly suffocating because you aren't one of the lucky 80,000 who did get a ventilator.Edited: 5:45 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Oxford Schmoxford. I'll go with Dr. Upstate, lol."
Some people are just plain nuts! Going to our favorite Chinese restaurant tonight to help keep them open as I'm sure the nuts are avoiding them. And yes let's buy all the toilet paper up as that is the most need item when the zombie apocalypse begins. Also we should estimate corona deaths on something that was reported by China as we can rely on that being 100% accurate and their healthcare system is exactly the same as ours. Oh and by the way lots of people stocked up on ammo a couple of years ago when that was going nuts so good luck keeping your toilet paper!
"Why are they closing them? According to most, including the CDC, risks are low."
"Funnily enough, I've never eaten at a Vegas buffet in the 7 trips I've been there. But this time we were thinking of doing the Bellagio Buffet for dinner once. I guess if they reopen by mid April I'll have to decide if I still wanna or not."
"Oxford is stating the mortality rate may be lower because the transmissibilty rate may be far higher than suspected. Exactly what I said. The same amount of projected people will become critically ill or die, only it may turn out twice as many people get it. So that's your reason not to take precautions and prepare?"
"Espn..read any good books lately, Professor."
Well so much for pointing out the ongoing absurdity of this and a plethora of related postings....
"Yup, cheaper to shut it down. Especially now when cruise lines are beginning to get sued for millions."
It is a wise decision.
"I'll have some of the yella, And don't get cheap on me."
"Ridiculous!We won't even hear about Coronavirus in 6 - 12 months...just add it to the list with Sars, H1N1, Ebola, etc."
Bravo to Upstate and #10. I could not have said it better.
"Actually if you had someone pass from any of the ones you listed, like I lost my brother, you might be singing a different tune..it is far from ridiculous, precaution is always smart..."
Qdogpa...I'm SO sorry for your loss.
"""We won't even hear about Coronavirus in 6 - 12 months...just add it to the list with Sars, H1N1, Ebola, etc.""The R naught of COVID-19 is much higher than the above-mentioned viruses (Ebola is rarely transmitted via droplets). SARS disappeared because cases were easy to identify and quarantine quickly or they died, as a result the virus died out. We're just about past that point with COVID-19. H1N1 still circulates, but there's a vaccine and it's not as contagious. This isn't a dooms day scenario like some people make it out to be, though it's probably not going away. It'll likely slow down in the summer and ramp up again next winter.Edited: 8:46 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Biotech may not come up with vaccines immediately but they are very good at mitigating diseases in the mean time. Even with today’s challenging viruses and bacteria, biotech has been very good at modifying or straight up using existing medications for off label purposes making the illnesses more survivable and less dangerous.. While I think Covid19 is more than the concerning than the flu; I agree by summer there is reason for optimism that this disease will be much better understood and less feared than it is today. But I’m an optimist.Edited: 9:48 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Well, I guess there's no reason to go to Vegas for a while. No buffets?"
"” Well, I guess there's no reason to go to Vegas for a while. No buffets?”Not all buffets are closed, try the buffets at CET resorts and others."
I am sure CET will be next. MGM always starts the ball rolling and then CET follows. I have to question why MGM isn't shutting down shows or concerts too. And why on Sunday? Could be because of the 130k people coming in town for a convention that runs through the 14th. Just sayin'
"Shacky: ""Why are they closing them? According to most, including the CDC, risks are low.""Are you talking about the same CDC that produced the faulty test and effectively refused to allow testing while they tried to fix it over the next few weeks? The same CDC that said they gave Trump the wrong info about the first fatality (they claim they told him she was a ""wonderful woman"", when in fact ""she"" was a man). The same CDC that set the guidelines so high for someone to get a test, that the virus was effectively allowed to spread throughout the population?You might want to re-think who is providing you with reliable info about this illness, and whether their first concern is saving lives or helping Trump get re-elected."
