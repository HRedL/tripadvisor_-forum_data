Most national parks in Tas seem to be listed as having an unsealed road when you drive in.This of course is a no go zone for most hire cars.How do tourists get around this problem without hiring out a massive 4WD?
"Hi thereAs a general rule, most car hire companies will require you to hire a 4x4 or 4WD for driving on unsealed roads. Hiring a 2WD for unsealed roads may void your insurance, but it is worth checking/comparing with individual companies before hiring.Places like Cradle Mtn have a tourist bus that can take you into the park itself, to save you driving in yourself. (this also prevents damage to the road itself from too many vehicles).Which national parks are you going to visit, african lion? That will help in giving you more detailed adviceCheers,"
"It requires a fair bit of fine print reading, but unsealed roads and hire cars aren't always mutually exclusive.I recently read the Europcar rental conditions on their website and it said 2wd cars can be take on any gazetted road apart from a few in NT and WA and west of Mt Isa in Qld, no mention of sealed or unsealed. I've driven planty of hire cars on plenty of unsealed roads (including in Tas) without repurcusions. Once or twice where the car got really dusty or muddy I paid $10 to run it through a car wash before returning ;-)"
"I recently hired a car in Tasmania and the contract conditions as explained (and written) made it clear that I could drive on unsealed roads BUT even though I'd taken out excess reduction my excess would increase significantly if there was an accident there. They went out of their way to make sure I understood this.As I recall, some unsealed alpine sections of highways were specifically mentioned as dangerous and subject to the higher excess clause."
"ive looked at all the major hire companies like Thrifty, Avis, Europcar, budget etc and all say unsealed is out of bounds.I think Avis have a Toyota RAV4, the others have massive 4wd's which i certainly dont want.I'm not going to Cradle Mtn, I will be visiting Hartz, Freycinet, Douglas Apsley and maybe Tasman. At parks.tas.gov.au most or all of these say that to drive into the park you'll be on some unsealed road at least some of the way.I've broken the rules in NZ without a problem.. but these roads are always rocky and have gravel flying up so its the scratches you have to worry about.What do you think, take the risk or are these roads going to be really bad?"
If they're anything like the National Parks roads in Sydney then i cant see anything untoward happening.The rogue stone throwing up and scratching the car would be the only concern.
"We recently rented cars both from Hobart and from Sydney both at Hertz. We are experienced travellers and always ask at the desk first (and thoroughly read the contract!) Hertz allowed to drive unsealed roads on Tasmania (with restrictions) because ""some places on Tasmania can't be reached without"" I think they were refering to Bruny Island. We had a Toyota Aurion. In Sydney they told us it's completely forbidden to drive unsealed roads unless for short drives to accomodation and National Parks. That also was in the contract. We had a SUV (Toyota Kluger) on the mainland.Nevertheless we drove good dirtroads like the one to Styx Valley in Tasmania and also many roads on the mainland. Tet"
"Just note that, contrary to what has been suggested (perhaps in jest) in another post, *some* car rental companies will penalise you for washing the rental car prior to return. I very recently rented from Avis and this was specifically mentioned both verbally and in writing prior to us driving off. In any event, I know of no car wash that will throughly rid of vehicle of mud in one wash cycle. No matter how many times you go through there will always be crevices and nooks and crannies. Sometime in early June I took my own sedan through an area in Vic's NW and in the course of that journey found myself going through a fairly lengthy section of muddy roadway. I am STILL finding granules and silt and all sorts of gunk all over the place...not to mention the engine bay looks like outback NT (i.e covered in red dust)! ;) "
"Africanlion, if you're worried about potential damage / the T&Cs etc, you could look into hiring a slightly older car where the suppliers may not be as concerned as others."
"Do check the fine print with your hire company. Have rented from Europcar in Tasmania several times, and their rules in Tasmania are different to the ones that apply on the north island(mainland).It may have changed, but we were allowed to take our 2WD hire car onto the dirt roads, but were reminded that underbody damage was excluded from our insurance cover."
"Well Ive just rang Avis and Budget and both said no unsealed roads, but if they have different rules at the local office am I meant to call Tasmania to find out?All so confusing, you'd think the head office would be able to provide a straight answer!"
"This is literally what our Hertz contract said for driving Tasmania:""The vehicle is permitted to be used on made roads only. It's prohibited to use the vehicle off-road, such as cross-country, on bushtracks or on beaches. If you ignore this prohibition you'll be liable for ALL damage and will not be provided with a replacement vehicle.Even on made roads, there's a higher liability for damage on unsealed surfaces (including the unsealed sections of roads which are normally sealed, so steadily slow right down before driving through roadworks""Also desk personal or even managers don't always know what the contract is all about, so read thoroughly. Made roads don't have to be sealed to drive them, otherwise you can't reach some National and State parks or even accomodation. We stayed on Kangaroo Island and our cabin was 5 kms from the main road and was unsealed so it was important we knew about the rules.Btw, you're not allowed to bring rental cars to an island nor to drive a car to the mainland when rented on the island. (some exceptions)Tet"
"Luigi, I have the rental contracts for Hobart and for Sydney right here. That line "" on made roads only"" for Tasmania is not mentioned in the Sydney contract which says: ""On any road or other surface which is not sealed other than a road under repair etc etc.""So there is a difference.Tet"
"I can confirm from experience also that Thrifty have different conditions in different states. Generally Thrifty tends to be a little more liberal than some of the others in terms of where their cars can and can't be dirven. Some companies also have conditions up in northern Qld about using the cape trib ferry, so yes, there are location specific rental conditions. If you'd have no problems driving your own car on unsealed roads, I still say bugger it and take the car on any decently maintained unsealed road, even if the contract says you ""technically"" can't. You're far more likely to have a prang getting out of the car park at the airport than you are doing 40kmh on a quiet dirt road in a national park somewhere. Like I said earlier, I've taken planty of hire cars on plenty of dirt roads. Calculated risk maybe...besides, things like minor stone chips to paint work can easily be explained away as occuring (for instance) while overtaking a truck on a highway...."
"Check your tyres before you take it out of the car park...we decided to get the tyre insurance on offer with our last Thrifty rental in Tassie. A day later when we came back to the car after being out and about, we noticed quite a sizeable screw in the tyre.We hadn't heard any noise to indicate that we'd driven over anything so we assumed that either someone put it in the tyre while we were parked, or it was there all along.When we took the car back to Thrifty, we told them we discovered the screw, but had no knowledge about how it got there, and they said absolutely nothing in response to this. Whether they knew about it before, I have no idea."
"Dougo, that must be epidemic. Same with us after picking up the car in Hobart and discovered the screw in Launceston. Hertz gave us another car immediately without extra costs. "
"As they say Tet, ""silence is golden"" and at the time, my cynical little mind went into overdrive when they expressed no surprise, disapppointment, and said absolutely nothing and nor did they move from behind the desk to inspect it - zilch !!! ""Uh-huh, gotcha!! and no wonder they offered us tyre insurance, probably hoping that we wouldn't take it"" was what immediately came to mind at the time.I have to say it's the only time we've been offered tyre insurance and the only time we've taken it up. "
"Hi africanlion! I rented a camper van in Tas and the contract said no unsealed roads. Well I stayed at a camp site in Wineglass Bay area and my battery dies so I had to call the insurance # and get a jump-guess they didnt care to tell the rental company because I never heard anything about it. I drove (as I butcher the spellings) from Launceston to Freycinate and Bicheno to Mole Creek, Cradle Mountain, up to Narwantapu. Roads were nice everywhere cept heading off to camp sites and even then they wernt anything you couldnt do in a regular old car. Not sure about the western side though (sigh didnt make it out there....I must return!) but as long as you keep an eye out for critters and pot holes you should be fine in any sort of car"
"All the companies seem to have different rulesAAA (a cheapy from Hobart)told me no travel on gravel roads at all, Avis wont allow their cars on Bruny Island which has a stretch of dirt. As far as I know, all the other compaies allow you on gazetted roads BUT if you have an accident, even if it isn't your fault, you may have to pay a substantial excess (ranging from around $2000-$5000)From memory Eurocars was the highest but I researched this a few months ago. Anyway, the roads aren't that bad , allow enough time to take it easy and you'll enjoy the scenery so much more and have more reaction time, the nearest I've come to an accident was when some peanut turned right in front of me on one of the best (and most dangerous) roads in the state- the Midlands Hwy."
