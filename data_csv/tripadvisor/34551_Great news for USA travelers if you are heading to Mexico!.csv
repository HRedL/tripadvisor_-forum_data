"Travelers returning from a trip outside the country or their state no longer face recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. The CDC updated its travel requirements online Friday, advising travelers to ""follow state, territorial, tribal and local recommendations or requirements after travel."" Previous guidelines recommended a 14-day quarantine for those returning from international destinations or areas with a high concentration of coronavirus cases."
"LOL, certainly didn't like having to face a ""recommendation"". We've now been upgraded to just a raised eyebrow. That certainly is great news."
"Thinking that if I have any chance at the end of Oct trip, we may have to discuss dropping Las Brisas for a more isolated property like the Marea beachfront villas.Much easier implementation of covid watchdog rules et al.Have been wanting to give them a try for awhile now anyway.Keith"
"A VRBO/AirBnB would suit your needs as well. We are thinking about fishing more, since the normal morning stroll through the market, shopping will be a no this time. Can fish every day, then just relax at the beach all afternoon. Will be a MUCH slower pace trip than normal, but I still want to go and support their economy as much as safely possible."
"Not having to worry about elevators would be a huge help. Still worry about the airport and planes, however."
"Hey Flatlander, could you provide the link for that info? I looked on CDC’s website, couldn’t find anything. Thanks."
"Playamomma, I heard it on the radio today; don't know anything about a link to the CDC website. Safe travels. ¡Diviertanse!"
"Copied from the cdc page, about halfway down under 'Check Travel Restrictions' :Check Travel RestrictionsState, local, and territorial governments may have travel restrictions in place, including testing requirements, stay-at-home orders, and quarantine requirements upon arrival. Follow state, local, and territorial travel restrictions. For up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state, territorial, tribal and local health department where you are, along your route, and where you are going. Prepare to be flexible during your trip as restrictions and policies may change during your travel.Link to the entire page:https:/…In essence, the cdc is deferring to local and/or state authorities."

"It's looking more and more like I won't be able to travel from Canada to anywhere this winter.....not really anything to do with flights or national laws regarding quarantine, but that my company is making anyone coming home from somewhere out of Canada self-isolate for 14 days. So, since I won't take two extra weeks off after a 1 or 2 week vacation, I'm SOL.It's possible that might change come January or later, but if Mexico still has sooooo many cases it will likely still be on the list of 'no-travel without a quarantine once home' places. In that case we will just go to Europe, or somewhere else with a low number of cases.It's going to be so hard getting through one of our harsh winters without at least one one-week escape to warmer climes, when we usually do 2-3 weeks/two trips over the winter. (Talk about First World problems though, I feel guilty even saying that out loud, so I am not gonna whine.)still crossing my fingers for a vaccine- and only one that's gone through the required testing, so that might be awhile."
And this is yet another reason why the U.S. leads the world in COVID-19 infections and deaths. SMH...
"10) If that is all that you have to contribute, then why even bother.Keith"
"Keith, I think what Beyond_YXU from London Canada means is the US leads the world in the number of tests, when actually the UK (you know, where the real London is located) leads in deaths via a higher percentage relative to total population. Canada would be right up there with the US if if were worthy of being an international travel destination, but fortunately nobody wants to go there, so there only exposure to the virus was from those Canadians forced to return home bringing the Covid-19 virus with them."
"The truth hurts, I guess. Carry on fiddling while your Rome burns."
"ouch Ted, that's a bit harsh...we get lots of Japanese visiting Vancouver and Banff, come on now.... lolWe haven't been hit nearly as hard as the USA because of several reasons, while not being a #1 travel destination is maybe one of them, it's far down the list in importance."
"Deaths per capita from Covid, as of August 25, 2020: Per million population Mexico 471.56, Canada 240.66, United States 535.58.Yes, the UK is somewhat higher than the USA as of now, unlikely for much longer, with the massive daily death rate the US is piling up. The UK is much more densely populated than the USA and was hit hard early on and also had a leader that negated the danger. Of course we all know that later on he was close to death from Covid. Transmission at this point in the USA has nothing to do with tourism from outside, it is all community transmission and not likely to decrease for awhile, and then the second wave hits. Note Sturgis, cases in 61% of the USA from that event."
"26% of the US deaths occurred in the New York and New Jersey state with New York being the transmission point due to international travel and dense population. Take those out of the mix and your numbers are meaningless. In addition it is a known fact that many US deaths are being listed as Covid deaths even when they are not. The US government and Medicare pay more for Covid treatment. Seems nobody in the US died from the annual flu which usually claims around 60,000 deaths. As for Mexico, they haven't a clue who is walking around with Covid much less how many have died from it."
"Awesome. I think Canada shouldn’t be long to follow that lead. And Beyond, the group doesn’t really need to hear your Crazy personal Thoughts on the matter. You just hide in the basement and let us do that we please."
Ted;None on which has bupkis to do with travel restrictions.I suggest a short hop over to the site where whining and bashing is welcome by the usual Echo Chamber for proper sage head-nodding coupled with essetial oil therapies. Keith
#17 Welcome to the Zihua forum dominated by a 1/2 dozen old right wing Trump supporting American males.
I was getting the impression that’s the demographic...
You've got enough problems of your own then to be worried about what's happening north of your borded.
"Ted..Dont be obtuse. In the last reporting year approx 20 million international visitors entered Canuckistan.14 million of those from the US.Secondly, you may be testing more but a larger percentage of those aren't processed in time to be of any use. As you know the purpose of which is to contact trace, identify and isolate. None of that can happen if you're wandering around infecting everybody on sight, while waiting for the test to come back. By the time it does, it's useless from a mitigation point of view.Finally, you have approx 4% of the worlds population...but 25% of the infection rate.You can lawyer this all you want but this is the time to say"" we're not doing a good job handling this""This is where you say ""yeah, but what about..."""
Have you ever been to Canada? That's what I thought; I cannot believe your comment about Canada...so disrespectful
"Ted writes: ""You've got enough problems of your own then to be worried about what's happening north of your borded.""Have no clue what that means?In any case, do not be too hard on poor Ted. He is living in a Covid hotspot with so many daily deaths, it must be very very stressful for him. And also his girlfriend on the forum has disappeared, maybe she is ill and that is hard on him, too."
"ManatobaBonnie, respect is a 2 way street. You want to get it, you've got to give it. Don't lecture me until you take a look back at the posts from your ""Robettes""."
"Ted, what are posts from your ""Robettes""?"
That is what others call your sycophants.But you knew that.Keith
"""""That is what others call your sycophants.But you knew that.""""Keith was that directed to my comment?If so, no. I have never heard that term before."
"Keith, I wouldn’t hesitate booking at Marea. It is amazing! You’ll easily be able to avoid crowds there. The beach is long and virtually empty. Each unit has its own pool. You can arrange for groceries to be delivered ahead of your arrival. It’s one of my favourite spots. I feel like I’ve been trying to find places to social distance for many years and this is one of them. But shhhh don’t let word get out. Enjoy!"
