I just saw in the news that the Corona type virus has increased to 200 cases and has spread to Beijing. Anyone concerned about this or changing their travel plans to China? We are suppose to be there in March. Thank you in advance for your opinions.
JDPM could you show me where? I did not see a post? And I believe when this first was reported it was a few cases related to live stock and contained to the area. Now it has been identified as a Corona virus with cases in Beijing and Shanghai. Since it’s an evolving and dynamic situation I thought appropriate to ask. Thank you

"Thank you KVchina. Interesting I don’t see this post after scrolling the last 60 posts. And when I search virus, outbreak, Wuhan nothing shows up. Please share any other links you may have."
Arrived in Shanghai yesterday and not really a concern (yet) over here. However I'm afraid that it might spread considerably more after people return from their Chinese New Year home-trips to Wuhan.
Thank you. I looked in Beijing and Shanghai and Wuhan. Will look at China forum. Thanks again.

"Better source is Facebook if you follow major reputable media, CNBC BBC South China Morning Post, etc. there are multiple latest updates several times daily, as it is a fast developing story with daily or hourly changes. As well as daily evening national news of ABC CBS NBC CNN FOX. I already canceled a March 2020 tour starting from Wuhan, but most others still going. On last Friday we had a meeting in office, we figured GZ is far from Wuhan, so we decided to go to Guangzhou on business in April 2020 and set the dates. But by the weekend and especially this Monday’s latest news and development, we decided not to go. News are coming in fast and every changing, becoming far more alarming this morning. Each person must follow the news and decide."
"Just watched a detailed report on local CBS station. CDC sent 100 inspectors to 3 US airports, all Wuhan pax are being screened. There is talk of screening all pax from China. It is now a big deal in the US."
"there is also talk of declaring some sort of worldwide epidemic....Mac you sound very informed and smart...why risk it...this does not sound like ""fake news"" as so many like to call every headline these days."
Be safe even though you are not in China. Reuters just reported an Australian man having symptoms that are SARS like. He was reportedly to have just returned from Wuhan as well. I think it best to take precaution wherever we are.
I am also going to Beijing in March. I’m not too worried
