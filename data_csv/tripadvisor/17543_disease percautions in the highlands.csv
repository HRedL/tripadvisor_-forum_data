We will be doing a ten day trip to the highlands and the amazon.I have read about yellow fever and other diseases . Do we really need to be inoculated for these diseases for our travel? How prevalent are these diseases in Ecuador? Thanks for you help.
"You should check with your doctor, the World Health Organization website has some good info on it about recommended/required vaccinations."
"The amazon is where the diseases are, not the highlands.Flu shot would be a good idea though, if you haven't had H1N1. There was a bit of an epidemic there last year."
"I always recommend a tetanus booster and the Hep A (or Heps A and B Twinrix) vax whether you travel or not. While malaria and YF are present in the Amazon, the risk is low for the average tourist. However, only you know your tolerance for risk, as it only takes one bite from an infected mosquito."
"At present you are required to have proof of yellow fever immunization when traveling to the Ecuadorian Amazon, so don't forget your yellow immunization card. The best source of the information you are looking for is the Centers for Diastase Control (CDC) website. Just go to the Destinations page and search for Ecuador. That will bring you to the page entitled: Health Information for Travelers to Ecuador, including the Gal√°pagos Islands"
"It may depend from where you are traveling as to whether you need YF proof. I was traveling in the Amazon region and other areas of Ecuador in February/March and no one asked for any proof of innoculation to YF or anything else. If coming from certain other South American countries, there is request of proof. As mentioned, the Amazon will be more of a concern for diseases. Take mosquito repellent. At times people say they didn't see any mosquitos, but even in the dry season, there were a number in the Amazon. Also, depending when you are travelling, if you are in the highlands during rainy season, there will be mosquitos there as well; though not carrying malaria. There are more chances of dengue fever in Ecuador, and no innoculations for that so, again, mosquito repellent. Of course, there are water borne illnesses to consider, so you could also consider typhoid innoculation. Most can be avoided by cautious hygiene and cleanliness, but if you are a frequent traveller, there are some basics that can help keep you a healthier traveller. Do review your government travel website for Ecuador, and it is best to visit a travel physician rather than your regular GP, as GPs are usually not versed in travel medicine nor have the appropriate innoculations handy."
"I am quite certain yellow fever vax is not REQUIRED for travel to the Amazon basin. It is recommended, but I've never heard of anyone--nor have I been asked for it in two trips at different times of the year--being asked for proof.There are some countries that do require proof if you are coming from an endemic country, but Ecuador is not one of them."
