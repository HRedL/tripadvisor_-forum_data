"Songkran , will be held. I take it you really do not understand the meaning of it ?. Yes it has been a bit 'Hit Jacked "" Like Christmas .!!! So one could forgive you for that.For many people and more so the Thai Nationals understand that it is more than throwing water and drinking.Perhaps Italy will cancel Easter this year ?Chok DeeEdited: 11:25 pm, March 02, 2020 "
Thankyou for the reply!
"That would be a blessing, canceling that utterly tedious waterfestival :unfortunately they won't be able to 'cancel' it. You can't forbid a 5 year old to play."
"#3 :it's supposed to be more,?? actually it's supposed to be only sprinkling water, not throwing buckets at motorists. Very little of what it is supposed to be is left. It has turned into often aggressive battles, often with chunks of ice in the hurled water for enhanced effect/pain. Talcum powder is smeared onto your face, into eyes, nose and mouth. Over 300 road fatalities, thousands paralyzed and severely injured over Songkran. It's not a celebration, it's mayhem."
Just wanted to know the situation guys! Thanks for the relplies!
"If this virus takes off, as some fear, the water tossing mob could very well be banned. Ironically, a short time ago, the powers that be were talking extending the holiday!"

And another interesting point.....there’s a severe water shortage in much of the country.
"A possible theses for a budding anthropology student might examining the timeline of Songkran, evolving from a rather quiet, solemn occasion, to a wild, drunken goat roping!"
The drunken water party events are slowly being cancelled. Would expect most of them to be within the next week or so.
Yes; my wife just said that Isaan's Khao Naow Road festival is canceled.
"Yes, happening!"
