"Some more encouraging news.The Region of Murcia (with the exception of Totana Municipality where there has been a spike in SARS-CoV-2 cases) will move to Phase 2 of de-escalation next Monday, 25/05/2020.This will mean a further loosening of current restrictions.Some examples would be the re-opening of shopping centres (at max 40% capacity), cinemas, theatres, etc, (at max ⅓ capacity). Apparently, the Regional Government of Murcia has requested that social gatherings be limited to 10 people maximum and not the 15 persons allowed under phase 2. Beaches are allowed to re-open (for activitiies other than the already allowed sport and walks) under phase 2 but the coastal regions await further guidance from central government on this.Please note that this move to phase 2 applies to the Region of Murcia and certain other regions but not the Valencian Community immediately next door. There, they've slammed the breaks on further de-escalation due to a spike in cases sending the R (reproductive) number up.In english: https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-2…In spanish (with useful de-escalation map by area): https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-05-22/sanid…If you're interested in what's happening next door in the Valencian Community, you can read more on that here...In english: https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-2…In spanish: https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-05-20/valen…"
"The Region of Murcia (including Totana Municipality) will enter phase 3 of de-escaltion on Monday 08/06/2020. As with previous phases, the plan is for the phase to last 2 weeks. However, the Government of Spain will allow the autonomous communities (regional governments) to determine exactly how long phase 3 lasts before they enter the 'new normality' once the final national state of alert ends on 21/06/2020. Please note that the Valencian Community next door has asked to remain in phase 2. Movement between the Region of Murcia and the Valencian Community is therefore not possible.The new freedoms are summarised in the links.In english: https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-06-0…In spanish: https:/…1119348.html:-)"
