I am an expat myself living in Barcelona. As you might know catalunya is going to be under lockdown. People can enter and leave under certain circumstances (don’t know if you can enter tho). I’d suggest you would seek information at your spanish consulate by email or phone. Most consulates are overwhelmed with emails and phones at this time tho.
