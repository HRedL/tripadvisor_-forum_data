"Hi, we are supposed to travel to Costa Rica next week staying in the los Sueños area and then Arenal. What is the current vibe there with the coronavirus? My husband thinks we should cancel but I really still want to come. Traveling with our 3 kids. Curious if there’s panic and hoarding with water etc. he’s worried about being quarantined in another country. so bummed ;(. Thanks!!!"
Also curious. Our trip is end of next week. We're currently monitoring - not making any decisions until after the weekend and we see how things further develop. Good thought to ask what the state of the general public is there.
"There have been no reported cases in Costa Rica. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of cases in the United States.To me, there would be no question but to go. You're in more danger of contracting the virus if you stay at home."
"I totally agree with Racandee. However, there is apparently one case - a woman who leaves near Limon who traveled to Italy.I'm leaving for CR next week. I'm more concerned my flights will be effected due to other passengers canceling."
"I totally want to go and I’m trying to convince my husband. Now that they are monitoring two people in CR he’s concerned. Not about getting the coronavirus but the possibility of being quarantined in another country with our three young kids is his biggest fear :(Edited: 11:30 am, March 06, 2020 "
"As far as panic, at this point there is none. Costa Rica is more about Pura Vida than panic. Costa Rica has been preparing for the virus for quite some time. As Racandee said you are safer here in CR, my concern would be jumping on a flight from the US. With that said, everything is subject to change day to day. I have a trip scheduled to go to the US in May and I am considering cancelling."
"I would sooner be stuck in CR than at home. At this time, it's soooooooo unlikley (well, maybe not at home)."
"Go. I don't think there are any reported cases there. Even if there are, doesn't mean you're going to catch it. We go everywhere with tons of people with the flu....."
There is a difference between taking appropriate cautions and letting fear dominate your life to the point you give up your best life experiences due to hypotheticals.Only way to be safe from 100% safe from infectious disease is to seal yourself in a bubble.
"My wife and I went to a birthday party last night. We are now heading to the Feria (farmer’s market) not only to buy groceries, but also to socialize. Tomorrow night we're going with some friends to a Saturday night dance. My point is, how do you plan to live your life as this progresses. And yes if somebody has the virus on your flight to Costa Rica you will be quarantined. There is a second suspected case here related to the first one. Costa Rica's health system moves very fast, the test results for the virus will be released tonight. And they have already located the 157 passengers and crew on the flight from the US to quarantine if the test comes back positive. As in everything in life common sense should prevail."

"I am definitely on the side of common sense and anti-panic. However, 95F (cooler than body temperature) isn't hot enough to kill or deactivate any infectious microbe."
"In my opinion it's not about the CR destination at the present time. It's about the possibly infectious journey, and the added financial cost. Plus the extra disruption, of any potential USA quarantine, compared to self quarantine- your home base.Myself would get travel advice related to health issues from my excellent medical professional, rather than a forum.Edited: 2:26 pm, March 06, 2020 "

Thank you everyone so much I totally agree with all of you and that is why I really want to go. Now if someone could just talk to my husband :( I think he is just being overly cautious because we’ll have our kids with us...youngest being a year old.
Coronovirus is already in Texas. As many as 13 confirmed cases in Houston. No confirmed cases in Costa Rica.
"ashley, Will one or both of you possibly lose your jobs should you end up quarantined and unable to report back on time, for weeks? It is not about the destination, or counting the cases, confirmed, unconfirmed..It is about the airports, planes, etc. If you are free, no matter what, have unlimited budget, there will be ppl taking care of your property and life at home, etc, should it become necessary, it is different. Accusations of panic when it comes to each individual's choice are irrelevant. It is simple practicality. No one knows about What might happen. How one can deal should smth happen, incl. being quarantined, is a different matter."
https://ticotimes.net/2020/03/06/updates-cos…Latest news on COVID-19 in Costa Rica.
Are they screening arriving passengers at the airport?
"This afternoon was reported a case bring it into Costa Rica by a USA tourist...but as far how bad she is ...they are saying she just have the symptons...very much under control...Any body arriving with suspicious symptoms...are getting monitor closely !!RoadadvsiroEdited: 7:20 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Ahhhhhh.....common sense. I totally agree.Edited: 1:34 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"It's not a matter of fear or panic, but a matter of Common Sense to avoid a possible 14 to 27 day waste of time and possibly a large amount daily living cost if someone (even the possibly asymptomatic) is quarantined or denied re-entry by their country.Most travel insurance does not cover pandemics back to when they started and very few Med Evac memberships will cover repatriation or body recovery for pandemics. Young Travelers are not likely a mortality risk, like the elderly, who will likely face a shortage of Hospital and other supplies, at some point.My humble prediction is that 6 weeks or less from now, we will be reading CR postings begging for rescue from conditions similar to the USA Washington State and cruise ship victim stories.Edited: 5:26 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"I live in Washington state. Right now, leaving seems like a good idea. Joking aside, my trip is at the beginning of April. United won't refund my flights unless they cancel it themselves. The villa I booked indicated they will be flexible but they do have a no cancellation policy so they don't have to refund us.My travel insurance doesn't cover pandemics. Only way to make a claim is if one of us gets sick before leaving. So while it may seem like an easy decision for some to forgo the trip, it will cost us thousands of dollars to stay home. It will be devastating to suffer that financial hit. I don't know what to do."
"@22, nat, Some airlines are waiving changes / cancellation fees (https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/5/21166359/us-airlines-coronavirus-cancel-flights-waiving-fees mentions United, too). The window to which it applies, i.e. how long ago the passengers purchased their air tickets, changes fairly rapidly these days. Depending on what you decide to do, how many days you have left, and on your rental agreements, you might be able to get a partial refund of the deposit (?). Or you have already paid the entire 100% accommodations costs, non refundable, for all your hotels?"
"I spoke to United, they are only offering a deal to people booking in March, I booked my flight in August. Luckily, most of my hotels I can cancel up until March 31-beginning of April. Same with activities. But the flights and villa are the most expensive portion of the trip and I'm out of luck. I thought I was doing the right thing getting trip cancellation, my bad for not anticipating a pandemic. Going forward, I would only get the cancel for any reason coverage despite the higher costs.Edited: 9:45 pm, March 07, 2020 "
I wouldn't cancel.. I did a short vlog about why I think we should still travel..If you're interested:https://youtu.be/SdZzhd1yH6Y
"If you don't go to CR, you will save all the money you would have spent there. Also you will not worry about being rained out, or sick, or virus closed activities, for possibly a large portions of your vacation. No concern for cost associated with repatriation and quarantine.Wait and see what happens with United, they are cutting flights, and may cancel your particular flight as the date approaches, for a refund. They may offer the same deal that is put forward for March later on? Can you change your flight for a $200? Fee to another date or destination, to a date before or after the present departure and use the credit from your present flight?If you used a credit card, Check with them for remedies (force majeure?) on the Villa? Can you move your existing Villa reservation to a different or less popular time and use your credit?Edited: 11:39 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"I just spoke to a local from Jaco, Costa Rica and he said there is now 5 confirmed cases in Jaco. Was brought in my 2 American tourists staying at Hotel Balcon Del Mar. as of today one of their maids started to get symptoms. I’m just going by what I heard as of 8pm this evening. I have no clue where or if they’re in quarantine."
I love that most of us agree ---POSITIVE mind...and avoid negative people talking about refunds etc...just conatc your airline..At the moment not a single case by transmission...most of our cases ...from North America and or Europe...Roadadvsiro
Super bummed we are cancelling after all due to the increase in cases. So sad. 9 cases plus 34 more suspected https://ticotimes.net/2020/03/08/costa-rica-…
"Ashley at 29, that is sad about your cancellation, but it's also the right decision for our own travel, as I'm in great shape, but over 70.Travelers to CR deserve to know what is happening with the virus and something positive will come from your posting of the link above which helps in making informed decisions.Some posters in the past have suggests that that uncomplimentary facts for travelers about CR are negative and should be censored, but facts matter more than just feelings.Edited: 3:57 am, March 09, 2020 "
"nat, re ""United won't refund my flights unless they cancel it themselves."" in # 22: Not sure why poster 28 is calling you a ""negative"" person for ""talking about refunds"". It is your money, your vacation and your decision. Of course, you need to do what makes you comfortable."
"For those of you choosing to stay home, please remember to avoid crowds of people, keep your distance, wash your hands well and frequently, and don't touch your face. Stay home if you feel sick.The biggest risk for most of us traveling soon is that travel restrictions will be put in place before we get home and our vacations will be involuntarily extended.Don't assume, though, that staying home will enormously decrease your health risks. That depends upon where you go and what you do."
"Add us to the list of likely cancellations. We are supposed to leave this Saturday the 14th. I just got the following message from our Airbnb host near SJO airport: ""Hello, I want to inform you that the area where my Airbnb is is on red alert due to a large outbreak of Coronavirus, even the order to close the hospital for massive contamination has been given, it seems to me to be better to inform you, and you make the decision, excuse me the inconvenience"".We only planned to spend very limited time near San Jose (basically one night at the beginning and end of our trip for convenience airport arrival/departure). My concern is things get worse and flights start getting cancelled or as others have said, some sort of travel restrictions back to the US are put in place."
"Thank you for the latest info. I am scheduled to arrive in 30 days and prob will cancel as well. Was really looking forward to this trip but can reschedule for a later timeEdited: 1:56 pm, March 09, 2020 "
I have been waiting for over a year to go Plans were April 10 to the 25 now don’t know if I can get my money refunded I would have to be insane not to cancel and it sucks.
"This is not an issue of sanity. Otherwise, I'd be insulted.  I'm leaving for CR on Saturday, and if my flights get me there, I'm going. I am a rational, sane person. There are more people with the virus in Florida than in CR. It's a matter of how much of a risk you're willing to take. I also have the option of working remotely. In fact, that may be forced upon some of us anyhow. I'll have good WIFI where I'm going. My biggest concern would be the cost of pet-sitting if my vacation gets extended."
Post 31 as always is attacking me in a sutile way...of course two ways to think...negative or positive...Hard to beleive how some people love to confuse others with nehgative opinions..is a matter of health...and nice to ead positive opinions...Most of our cases as today are imported...that is the reason ...most of us are positive and trusting our health dPT... and of course our common sense.Roadadvisor
Let me rephrase that still very upset over this I am a diabetic 53 years old and told by my endocrinologist absurdity not to go.
Thank you...nice explanation...me too Im diabetic...and I jm conren but positive...Roadadvisor
"The situation is different for people with chronic medical conditions, especially if their immune systems are compromised.For young, healthy travelers, the risks are logistic. I wonder if wait times for security, for example, are longer due to extra scrutiny, or shorter due to fewer people flying.Is there any type of screening taking place at SJO?"
Good question...mimsadisy...the answer is YES...Right now some of the top health experts in Costa Rica are in a TV show...reporting the measures they are taking...Any body with any simptoms arriving at any one of our airports...or borders...will be test and decided what to do with them.Nice to be in Costa Rica to asnwer direct questions...Roadadvsiro 100% costa rcan indianTravel ProfeSional and a Pro driver
Traveling on the airlines is dangerous. I would suggest you cancel for now. We rent our cottage on air bnb but We arent doing it right now.
"Thank you Stepahnie ...nice advice..I drove yesterday to many Guancaste locations...Tamarindo, Nicoya, Filadelfia, Liberi LIR...and people were happy and positive...As we are telling the people...Lets works this together..is a serious situtation...!!Roadadvsiro"
"We are in the middle of a global pandemic and the most important thing we can do is flatten the curve so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed and more people die as a result. In Italy, they are in the difficult situation of having to only save the younger and healthier and letting the older die because they don't have enough ventilators. Let that sink in. Several European countries are on the same trajectory as well as the US. We are about to see an explosion of cases. In Washington state where I live we are at 37 deaths and counting. Schools are closed for 6 weeks. Bans on large crowds. We are trying to get ahead of thing but it's not looking good. Hospital are cancelling non essential surgeries and supplies are running out. So I don't give a rats ass about anyone who says taking a global pandemic seriously means you are being 'negative'. It's not about you, or your tourist dollars. It's about the millions of lives that are at risk.My experience in trying to cancel a trip I put in so much time and energy into planning and looking forward for has been frustrating to say the least. As it stands, United will give us a credit but we must book by August and fly by December. Not sure if this situation will be resolved by then. The villa that I reserved told me that I have to share the burden of this. The last I checked when you purchase a vacation rental for profit, it's you who should shoulder the burden not the consumer. But it is what it is. The best they are offering me is 50% refund. And then they can rent it someone else given how busy it gets around Easter. I am going to wait until the last minute to cancel the flight and villa. My trip insurance will cover flight cancellations. Trump has indicated he may place a travel ban on Washington if it gets worse. And it will, the only reason the numbers are not a lot higher is because of basically no testing. They also cancelled all flights from Europe/the UK and Ireland. Perhaps by April 1st, there will be flight cancellations to Costa Rica.Tabacon Thermal Resort and Spa has been great, despite having a no cancellation policy they are refunding us. But Selvatura Park Monteverde and Sky Adventures Monteverde are giving me the run around despite allowing cancellations 48 hours prior. Whenever I call Selvatura, they transfer me to a million different people and eventually hang up. I sent multiple emails and no response. Sky Adventure assured me yesterday they would cancel my reservation and today I get an email telling me to reschedule. I shouldn't have to call over and over and send email after email for them to honor their cancellation policy. I want to reschedule our trip to Costa Rica when this is all said and done but I am really starting to have a bad taste in my mouth for some tour operators. We will remember who was flexible during this crisis and who wasn't."
"So sorry about selvvatura and Sky Treck...so sorry...as a costa rican I feel very bad really bad about what they are doing to you...I wish I can do somenthig...RoadadvisorEdited: 4:10 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"""We will remember who was flexible during this crisis and who wasn't."" - not only you but millions of travellers in your position. Short term decision will impact long term results. I do understand the part where they do not want to offer full refund; but not to transfer it into a voucher for when you will be able to visit this country is just unacceptable.When Easter will come, most probably the whole of US will stay home. And by next Easter, many of you that have had hard time dealing with the present situation, will go elsewhere."
Would love an update on your trip. Can you share any details? We are trying to decide if we should still come and have plans to arrive this week.
Good point Xelas...who was good and helpfull and who was not...taking notes !!roadaddvisor
"xelas, it is within the right of the villa owner to not accommodate us because we did reserve knowing the cancellation policy. But this is an extraordinary situation, its not just us willy nilly changing our minds. If they were to give us a voucher to use for next April, I would have taken it.But companies like Selvatura Park and Sky Adventures should not be giving us the run around because they have a 100% refund if cancelled within 72-48 hours. You are correct that millions are going to reconsider their travel plans going forward, even choice of airlines.One important thing I have learned is that despite the higher costs of insurance premiums that allow you to cancel for any reason, I am only going to purchase those plans. My bad for not foreseeing a pandemic, I was careful to get a policy that covered illness and loss of job but never imagined a situation like this."
My husband and I are flying out 4/19 from Detroit to San Jose. Delta will allow us to change our tickets but we are booked at Tulemar and they have a no change/cancel policy. We are healthy with no medical issues so we are not going to cancel at this point. I hope we are making the right choice.
From Tico Times Editor regarding Traveling to C.R. https://ticotimes.net/2020/03/13/letter-from…
"Re post 50) At least Tulemar Resort is announcing updated terms with flexibility for arrivals until end of April. If you have booked with Tulemar.com, I assume its different company, but you could claim why would they not apply similar policy, for the same property?https:/…"
"I heard the bars and clubs have closed but not restaurants, at least not yet. Does anyone know if the beaches are closed or going to be? Same question regarding parks & rainforest?"
">We are healthy with no medical issues so we are not going to cancel at this point.<That's great for you.Others are not as young or healthy, though, and you may inadvertently simply spread this virus to people who are high risk and/or have limited access to appropriate care and will, thus, potentially, die.Doesn't sound like the ""right choice"" to me.While I am not in the high risk group, many of my neighbors are. Can't say where you stand ethically, but for me, it's an absolute 'must' that I do not endanger other people who can die simply because of my egotism and/or foolishness.Edited: 6:02 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Glad to read I am not the only one suggesting that international travels for pleasure should be temporarily self-suspended also in countries that have not (yet) started to close their borders.
"Xelas, I think it's just about the most irresponsible and selfish thing one can do at this point.Alas, even the US government (and quite a few citizens who are in total denial) will have to come to terms with reality at some point. And they will have to tell US citizens just how bad this already is - in the rest of the world and in the US. Artificially deflating numbers by limiting testing only to deceive the population will only work for so long...In the end, they will likely have to follow the same procedures as an ever-increasing number of nations - and that means limited or no travel. In essence, threads such as this one are a non-starter. Compared to the US, we both already live in the future - and we know what's coming...Edited: 6:46 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Indeed so. But I am still so sad why people can not understand some simple things. This virus is for now an enigma for scientists. There is no vaccine for it. Mortality rate is higher then in similar flu-related viruses. it is spreading much faster. And finally, it is transmitted from human to human.If you want to read even more irresponsible reactions then jump on to Sri Lanka forum."
"Mmm mortality rate higher than some (SARS) and quite a bit lower than others (Swine flu). I spent quite a bit of time last week researching pandemics since, you know, I can't go anywhere."
Thank you ArskaDiver in Finland! I just read your post somehow I missed it. Been too overwhelmed with the ever changing information. This is the best news ever about Tulemar! Sending you a virtual hug from Michigan and wishing you good health.
"Re: poster 54/framptonianI don’t fly internationally 30-40 times a year, first time to a foreign country in years and this trip to Costa Rica was to be a one time event. The thought of cancelling after all the effort to make this happen and the expense I have put out is heartbreaking. I may not have the opportunity to reschedule. You don’t know my situation. You say you don’t know where I stand ethically but then go on to suggest that proceeding with my trip is egotistical and foolish and will result in people dying! I guess I have the ethics of a mass murderer according to your rude, outrageous response to my post. Thankfully most people are kind and helpful on TA and use this forum to provide useful information. But then there is someone like you who seems to use this as a platform to degrade people in writing you will never meet. So sad."
"Greatlakesgal, extraordinary times requires extraordinary measures and extraordinary sacrifices. No one is accusing you anything; only asking you to understand the risk of transmitting the virus from more affected countries to less affected countries.Once in a lifetime ... this year, sadly as it is, it will be once in a lifetime year for way too many persons due to coronavirus. 6526 and counting. That is really heartbreaking."
"I understand that this is a huge inconvenience and financial burden for you. But it is what it is.Calling out behavior for being selfish when it clearly IS selfish is not rude. It just is.This is a major crisis with thousands of people dying from an infection that is spread by people being in contact with others. And you want to go ahead and put yourself on a crowded plane and travel to a country that, in no way, has the financial and medical resources to come even close to dealing with this outbreak.Does that make your ethics screwed up? You bet!Sometimes the truth hurts."
"There is NOTHING slefish about continuning with your plans if you are healthy and have the clearance of your doctor if you have any underlying issues.We cannot stop iving because this is a highly politiced issue.

"""if you are healthy and have the clearance of your doctor"" - I assume you are talking about being tested negative on coronavirus, yes?!While you can not stop living, others do. Common sense is not to spread the virus; stop travelling does not equal to stop living.Oh, good, at least there you will be away from most of Ticos."
"Did you all stop traveling while SARS, Swine Flu, MERS and the common FLU circulated"
"Did you have read the consequences of those other vs the COVID-19?! And I have visited Costa Rica despite of dengue being present. Anyway, you will do what you will do. I will remain at home until further notice.Edited: 12:52 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"All travel should be canceled for now. Even a healthy individual can spread the virus to others, To travel within the next month shows a profound lack of understanding of the current situation, a profound lack of compassion for those who have underlying conditions, and a lack of common sense, The world is holding its breath, and it needs to do that for a bit."
"Let's see:Common Flu: Mortality rate roughly 0.1% of those who catch it (roughly 35 million in the US alone).SARS: Mortality rate: 9.8%. Total number of infected"" 8098 - worldwide but primarily confined to Asia.MERS: Mortality rate: 34.4%. Total number of infected: 2494 people SINCE 2012 up to today. Overwhelmingly confined to Saudi Arabia.H1N1 (Swine Flu): Mortality Rate: 0.02%. Total number of infected world wide: 700mil to 1.4 bil.Covid19: Currently 175,000 cases worldwide and rising by several thousand every day. Mortality rate varies by age. For those over 80, mortality rate is around 15% but overall roughly 3.5%. Italy currently reports one death every effing four minutes!!!If we apply the same infection numbers as for the common flu, the US will see 35 million infected. The common flu generally kills roughly 35,000 people in the US alone. Corona is set to kill anywhere between 400,000 and 1.7 million.With all due respect - and I don't think much is warranted - but spreading this disease because it won't kill you but only others is the epitome of selfish behavior. It's more than that - but those words are not allowed on TA.Even more so if you are fine with spreading it in countries that do not have the proper resources to cope with this.Do you have elderly parents? How will you feel if some irresponsible moron causes them to fall ill and expose them to a disease that has a 15% chance of killing them?Gosh, I have a hard time believing people are like this.And yes, I experience absolutely no surprise that you'd be a RIU visitor. Living up to every stereotype in the book.Edited: 1:04 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"And what the heck is highly politicized about this situation? That may apply to a few morons in the US, but the rest of the world doesn't care much for your petty nonsense."
"I would also add that the health minster of Costa Rica the other day said all travel should stop. But you are right Frodo, you know better than the health experts all over the world and the health minister of the country you are trying to rationalize visiting.Framp is right, we care not for your silly USA politics and this has NOTHING what so ever to do with the little dog and pony show that it encompasses. Plain and simple, this is a health issue, it is something our entire species is dealing with, and that is where it ends. If you think this world wide pandemic is just a political move to get Trump, then I guess we can rule out any common sense on your part."
"All it shows, Inca, is that governments really do need to take decisive action. There will always be fools who cannot wrap their minds around a situation and who will cling to any justification, no matter how outlandish, to pursue their selfish goals.Even the US with its atrocious response to this crisis will not be able to ignore the realities of this situation for ever. And that means, that even people like Frodo will have to turn their brains on and act responsibly.Alas, just like in the case of this Kentucky ID-10T who had to have police stationed at his house to keep him from spreading the virus, some people simply don't have the intellectual resources to comprehend anything.Let's hope that CR closes its borders soon and force people like Frodo to stay put.From what I read in other threads, it's becoming increasingly more difficult (if not impossible) to take international flights. The US has already banned flights from Schengen and the EU is closing all borders to foreigners. It's about time CR follows suit.Edited: 1:23 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Frodo, it is reassuring that you are staying at the Riu... By staying on this isolated pitri dish of hotels you are less likely to infect Costa Ricans."
What are the chances Costa Rica closes it's borders?
"increasingly likely Nat4crim. I do not expect the borders to hold long. Other Latin countries are closing borders, Argentina just did."
"A friend of mine is Guatemalan and has been in Costa Rica for four months. So if you do the math, his visa is expired. Now he is sick, and he won't seek treatment because of his fear over his visa status. So even if Costa Rica did not close its borders, how many people in his exact situation do you suppose are also in Costar Rica right now?"
"Costa Rica officially is closing ports, land borders and airports...as tomorrow...Nobody will be allowed in or out of Costa Rica...only people from Costa Rica or legal citizens...but they will be place in quarantine..Of course anybody will get medical treatment...citizen, resident or vivitor...Please lets stop people that HATE Costa Rica and love to trash our country...time to get together..and no room for haters or fake news or ugly people.At the moment is a National Press Conference...and they are tellnig us...that all schools are going to be closed until second week of April..Roadadvisor 100% costa rican indianTravel ProfeSional and a Pro driver"
"Roadadvisor, majority of regular members have showed nothing but love and deep concern for your country. Many has been telling visitors not to come, to leave the country, and thus to lessen the burden of fighting with this epidemic. Now also your government understood that drastic times requires drastic measures."

"Yes I am GLAD we are staying t the RIU. If the rest of CR is as arogant nd petty as the ""EXPERTS"" on this board I do not want to be around them.Yes the borders are now closed. Might be a good call who knows. Everyone can self contain and incubate for two weeks then unleash the virus.FWI I AM against the RIU's policies as I am well aware of the policies of the RIU especially in Jamaica where we visit ofter. I would never stay in a RIU in Jamaica. However there was a specific reason we chose the RIU in CR. Yes I chose it with my nose pinched, It is what it is. YOu should not stick your nose up to people who chose the RIU.Instead you should be against the Government of CR who ALLOWED the RIU to do what it did in CR.Getting off soap box now.IF flights resume by the 17th we will visit and enjoy the RIU and our plans."
"Nothing arrogant or petty about calling out people who are selfish and irresponsible enough to endanger the lives of others.This is a travel forum and we are all travelers who are impacted by people who insist on making the wrong decision. If you blatantly opt to be one of them, then many people will rightfully not stand by silently. I know that I won't.Take a look in the mirror and try to figure out where you went wrong. Perhaps you can still learn what it means to be a responsible member of society."
"I am a responsibe member of society, YOu have NO ides what my family does for a living. YOu have NO idea who I am. Just because people have different opiopns then YOU then we are irresponsible?Where do you ""experts"" get off telling people to NOT post on the forum because they are boking the RIUDO you think you are the only people on here that have information about CR or the RIU. You ""experts"" are arrogant."
"LOL. Your behavior speaks volumes...No further explanation needed.From your profile:Stay at home mom of 3 four legged pups. Active with Soldiers Angels which supports our troops overseas. Medically retired from a Large Retail Chain as a District Manager.Edited: 9:54 am, March 17, 2020 "
Yes that is true..... YOu have NO idea who my family is.
"Probably has all the 'pups' equipped with phony service dog cards so she can take them wherever she wants, restaurants, movie theatres, etc."
"Calm down, Karen. Nobody cares who you are, who you pretend to be, who you think you might be, or who your family is. Nobody!!!As I stated before, the callous and selfish behavior you propose and display doesn't just speak volumes, it screams, thunders, and shouts.Arguing that nobody should give a damn how many elderly people might die or displaying absolute callousness about spreading a highly infectious virus in a developing country all because YOU want to go to the RIU is truly a deplorable stance.For crying out loud, grow up, realize the world doesn't revolve around you and your needs, and at least try to act like a decent human being.Edited: 12:36 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Your flight is scheduled on 18th, yes? If it will arrive within 11:59 p.m. you will be allowed to enter the country. If it will arrive at 00:01 on 19th, you will not be allowed.In the first case, with your nose pinched and with your mouth shut (for health reasons), transfer to your hotel of choice the shortest and the quickest way. Enjoy the property, the sun, the swim-up bar, and tip generously. God knows those workers will need every cent you can give, in order to survive future weeks. Don't think about possibility that either you or your hubby have contracted virus, either while travelling to Riu or within Riu enclosed compound. You might even be lucky to be self-quarantined in that same location, for 14 days.How will you come back, and to what situation, also only God knows.Pura Vida, as my Tico friends often says."
Totally agree with Fram and xelas...It is time to help each other...nice to feel that support...at least for us older costa rican people...and of course a lot of respect for us.YES Pura Vida xelas
"Just heard from my travel guide, that their jobs have been placed on hold! They are unemployed as of now, without pay or insurance. Such a beautiful country. Hopefully COVD-19 will disappear soon and we can visit C.R again!Edited: 12:36 pm, March 29, 2020 "
"That is going on all over the world. Many countries are, or will, implement emergency laws to support those that have lost the option to create income. It will be a slow recovery, but it will happen. Maybe something good will come out of all this mess."
I wonder if she got to the Riu.
"@89 Doris, May I ask if you will be returning to the dentist you were describing earlier (https:/…103855018)?"
"Nobody is moving around Costa Rica,,,just a few hoours a day...an Dental Clinics are close..After Eastern week...very much same restrictions...and not a single visitor allowed into our country!!roadadvsro"
"We are supposed to fly out July 15. I can't yet tell if the country will be open to travelers. We too were planning to stay in San Jose one night because it's close to the airport. Even if we get in, will there be a 14 day self quarantine? The beaches in Jaco and Quepos are supposed to be open on July 13th I think, but who knows. We are all young and healthy. I'm from Texas, and we are open. Some people wear masks, but it's by choice. I hope this is the end, but I don't know if we should try to cancel. It took quite a while to get all 8 of us planned and coordinated. Plus the Airbnb owners are feeling the financial pain. Is it safe enough now? There will never be zero deaths. It's part of our fabric now."
"Therese, no ody knows for sure but I think it is very unlikely that you will be flying in that soon. Especially for the USA where there were over 18,000 new cases just today. Costa Rica has been experiencing a dramatic increase recently too.I would let the airline cancel. It will be easier to get your money or a credit that way."
"It is not looking good at all.. https://ticotimes.net/2020/06/16/health-mini…He even mentioned ""tourists coming from countries without mass transmission"""
"It is my opinion only, but I am sure that Costa Rica will not open its borders to international travellers for pleasure (tourists) that soon, Theresa. And when they will restart receiving tourists from abroad, there will be many conditions/requirements to fulfil, as can be seen in other countries that are serious about the health of their citizens. Personally, despite living in Slovenia, a country with a very good coronavirus situation, I would not (I will not) travel to Costa Rica this summer."
"I had paid in full for our July 21-31 stay at Hotel Costa Verde in Manuel Antonio. Their policy is a full refund if you cancel within 15 days prior to your stay. On May 2, I emailed asking for my full refund. As of today, June 25, I have received nothing of the over $1400 due me. I email weekly and get excuses. If I do not receive it by next week, I plan to have my credit card company dispute the charge. I love this hotel and have stayed there for years. I know they are probably scrambling to come up with the money to make thousands of refunds but feel I have been very patient since waiting since May 2. Were I not fearful that they could go out of business as this pandemic stretches longer and longer (causing us to lose our money completely), I would have taken a credit toward a future trip. Any suggestions on how to get a refund? TIA"
"Have you tried calling them?Phone calls here are less easy to ignore sometimes?BerniPura Vida Hotel and dog playground with a victory gardenEdited: 4:22 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"Thanks, Berni! I’ll try that. Regards."
I would personally just call credit card company and dispute the charge. Of course just my opinion. Hope it works out for you
