"All Federal branches of government are closed except for emergency services and most seniors are advised to be removed from the work force. Many public and private venues are closing and people are advised to stay home. That being said, there is no national curfew. Some municipalities have implemented alcohol ban and curfew but Mexico remains open with freedom of movement."
"Not all restaurants are shut down in Puerto Vallarta but many are. We are supposed to be sheltering at home, especially if over age 60 and leaving only for essential services. I did see people eating at the restaurant at Los Arcos the other day (Thursday). Some hotels are closing, few if any tours are operating. The marina is closed to commercial traffic. Flights are very limited. People are still walking on the malecon but much fewer. Some people are on the beach but it is a greatly reduced number. Some beach vendors are still trying to make a living. I have only been out briefly on Thursday and Sunday this past week.People who live in more Mexican residential colonias say they have not seen much change in behavior on the street however. This does not bode well for reducing the virus’ spread or flattening the curve enough to not overwhelm the medical system. Jalisco has the second largest number of cases after Mexico City."
Yes iac. I am sure that is correct about the behavior in more remote colonias. Most of the people are still walking around for no reason. Somehow the urgency needs to get explained to them better. Many do not read the news at all. Maybe a car with a loudspeaker like the guys selling gas. I am serious.
"Well, they don't wear seat belts and don't wear helmets. Why would they believe the virus will kill them?"
"I was going to say something about cultural differences (similar to post #4). Death is much more a ""circle of life"" thing in Mexico than in many Western countries like the U.S. You only have to look at their Day of the Dead to begin to understand the differences. Nobody mourns better/harder than Mexicans do for the first few days after the death of a loved one but then they move on more easily - part of this is their deep belief in their Catholic faith. This compared to the death of a loved one in the U.S. sometimes becoming a lifetime defining event where the survivor never really ""gets over it"". Different cultures simply view death (like many major life events) differently."
"#4 Actually many people in Mexico use seatbelts and use helmets, it's the law and although you'll see many stragglers, most Mexicans are aware of the consequences. Your comment reads like in Mexico people say ""Americans sure love their chewing gum and their cocacola"". Not an apt description but rather a dated stereotype.#5 It's true, our culture laughs at the face of death or misfortune, ours is a rather nihilist attitude towards risk. I would attribute it more to the native attitude rather than the Catholic but I could be wrong. That said, I believe people change. I hope we can overcome this contingency as individuals and as a nation.Edited: 1:43 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"There are a few restaurants still operating on the beach plus Seranos, Joe Jacks and Margarita grill. I will be putting them on my no go to list when this is all over. Seems profits Trump health and lives. Sigh."
"Seatbelts and helmets on motorcycles are the law in Jalisco. So that is a mute issue, as they say I guess rules are made to be broken. On the whole I believe Mexicans are aware of the virus and its consequences. Many people even the less fortunate have TV. PV is a tourist town so maybe requests to stay home are thrown to the wind. Who knows. Those restaurants that remain open are not following requests for good of all. The Stay at Home order is now one month and is a request for all but essential things. Who will follow this and what will happen for the holiday is yet to be seen. Hopefully people will stay home, quédate en casa. We are all in scary times and all have different thoughts. I do not think this is a cultural thing as much as just a people thing."
"#8 kevin....""Seranos, Joe Jacks and Margarita grill""....Good to know. Keep that list updated. One already has seen the last of my pesos for other reasons!!"
"#9-bezerk: ""as they say I guess rules are made to be broken"" ain't that the truth, especially in Mexico. Mexicans don't like to be told what to do and even I resent it, having spent most of my life abroad. This is why the government hasn't implemented a nationwide curfew. We simply don't have the resources to control 130 million people. However, in the last 48 hours I've seen a sharp drop of traffic and the streets are empty here in Puebla with only 51 reported cases. I'm sure this Semana Santa will bring historic losses to the national tourist industry and many beaches will be empty. We have to wait and see.Edited: 3:42 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"Miguel A, I am seeing decent response in my area but some non compliance in Chapala proper. I am so hoping Semana Santa this year is a trend setter as the year it wasn't! It could make a huge difference. We so have to hope."
"Kevin, thanks so much for sharing the name of these places! Seranos, Joe Jacks and Margarita grill, will never see another nickle of my money again.Some people are just greedy and stupid. I truly hope no one eats there, and/or catches anything! Stay home and be safe."
"I’m assuming since there’s almost no live sports on TV, that El Torito, Steve’s, Player’s, etc. are closed. Can anyone confirm?"
"I hope nobody catches it either. But how does anybody know if it's simply greed, maybe they are trying to support staff and pay their health insurance. Many of these employees are very attached to their employees and care deeply about them, like family.It's nice to be able to work from home, or be retired, and maintain that steady income knowing you can still pay the bills and buy food just like before. But that is not the case for the young people working in the restaurants. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe it was agreed upon by the employees to stay open. We just don't know the full story.Edited: 8:27 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"typo 1st paragraph, 2nd sentence of my post 15. I meant many of the *employers are very attached to their employees, like family.And I'm not saying I think they should be open, but I do feel that people who go to Restaurants are adults, and make their decisions on their own. Restaurants should be closed to seating, but I do try to put myself in the owner's place, this is an awful time for so many people in PV who feel responsible for their employees, and others. It stinks for so many people all over the world.Edited: 8:34 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"I do not think it is per se greed either but it has been requested by the government of Mexico for the good of all to close, restaurants can do take out or delivery. Unless totally necessary folks should be staying home, so the customers are at some fault here as well. Mexico has done the correct thing by shutting down for a month, quite quickly, let's hope it might be quick enough to save many. The health and financial fall out are staggering."
"It's no different in PV than anywhere else. Restaurants all want to pay their employees, but they can't stay open just to do so. Everyone is struggling, so I don't think giving them a pass is right. THey should be closed period. And if they can't pay staff, then they can't. That's the harsh reality of the situation to try and flatten the curve and keep everyone as safe as they can. Joe Jacks's, Seranos and MG are also off my list. I am immune compromised and to stay open is just plain selfish and irresponsible."
"I have to agree with post 18, totally. It is no different than anywhere else, just the numbers are different. That is cold, harsh reality in a pandemic."
"Just because I'm able to put myself in the owner's place, doesn't mean I'm saying they should be open. I am saying it's good to have some understanding for the position they are in. My husband owned a business with nearly 500 hourly employees. When his employees had problems they came to him and asked for help. Money, or even a wife bringing her kids in and asking my husband to tell them to lecture them about fighting. He helped his employees in any way they needed as much as possible, every one of them. He never said it was a harsh reality, pandemic or not, I can't do anything. We had a guaranteed income, they did not. When the National Guard was called during Desert Storm, many employees were called. Their wives came to him for help during that entire year, children in arms. Unless you've been there as an owner, you may not understand how responsible some owner's...but not all, feel for their employees.Edited: 11:02 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"I owned a shop for the 10 years I was married to my first husband (he still owns it) and know exacty what it's like to want to help your employees. But this is at the safety of many, many people and it should not be tolerated or excused. Sorry if harsh reality sounds harsh, but it is. I don't know any other way to explain it."
"Neither do I. Wanting to and doing are two different things. But we don't know the story, so it's all just what it looks like from the outside. I want the whole world shut down, but it's not going to happen.Edited: 11:09 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"My husband and I are both immune compromised. Do you think we're going to a restaurant? Heck no. It works both ways, the irresponsible people who are patronizing these restaurants should stop doing it, and the restaurants would be forced to close other than take out or delivery services."
"Kansas, All of Mexico is on requested stay at home orders until April 20th. Cars are driving the streets making announcements, there is no whole story, the whole story is staying at home ( unless essential) and save lives or go out and be irresponsible and possibly kill yourself or others. If people would listen in Mexico maybe we could have less impact by learning from other countries mistakes. No money coming in here either, not retired income yet and my husband who employs both my sons is getting little work, so yeah he loves those employees but realistic and harsh is what this is, no way around it. There is no inside or outside view only life or death right now. No excuses, sorry to be blunt but it could be catastrophic if not heeded now before the spike. Jalisco by there stay ay home order ahead of others in country lowered the curve..we need to do even more NOW!!Edited: 11:32 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"There is no using examples of help to employees here, I too owned a company with over 300 employees. I am very able to put myself in others shoes, my life looks very glamorous but was not always that way. Here is the thing, how can you compare something like a pandemic to anything you or anyone else has experiences when we have not had one since 1918. No Excuses, Help where you can, but stay home. Restaurants can do deliveries to make some income. If you have extra money to spare then send it down to Mexico to help, or New York, so on.. but please do not make exception or excuses to not following secretary of healths request in Mexico now with president on board! Non essential stay home and social distancing for everyone.Edited: 11:41 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"I appreciate your thoughts bezerk.  The harsh reality is that there is nowhere I know of where all people are going to comply whether it be a business or an individual.  All offenders ie. restaurants to individuals are equally responsible in my book and are going to slow down the process and more people will die.  Plenty of blame to go around. Either way, this subject is too big for writing down every thought on a forum. :-)"
"Just released (Pam Thompson FB page);The General Health Council declared #Health EmergenciaHealth because of force majeure to mitigate the transmission of #COVID19. We announce the extension of the suspension of non-essential activities from March 30 to 30 April. :The entire population who do not participate in essential activities are urged to comply with correspondable home shelter. We call for the voluntary limitation of mobility by staying at the private home as long as possible.The Secretaría de Marina and the Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional make available their health capabilities to support during the health contingency. This doesn't mean militarizing government action. All measures must be applied with strict respect and adherence to human rights.Finished the suspension of non-essential activities and the correspondable home shelter, the Secretaría de Salud, according to the Secretaría de Economía and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social, will issue the guidelines for a phased and regionalized return to work, economic and social activities."
"II am so glad the President of Mexico (and others) changed their stance.Hopefully the populace will get on board too, but it seems it is taking longer."
"Funny there were plenty of people talking about how inconvenienced they were to have to cancel a trip and then were so excited to book another in July , talking about their favorite restaurants and asking what people here had to eat and to describe it etc...... Not so funny now is it? There are plenty of people here that have a very dim view of your happy place community. At any rate please be safe."
"I, too, Kansas, can tell you how appalling I find that intelligent people continue to flaunt going out to restaurants/bars. Stay at home/condo/apt. means just that. Find how to amuse yourself and be glad you have a choice."
"I have a better idea for the people that post here, stop making judgement calls on people and restaurants down here as you sit back at home in the U.S. and Canada. I haven´t seen to many posts that are helpful to anyone."
Your post was helpful.lol. I think not. People have a right to their opinions about people who are blantly disregarding all the warnings the world is giving them (businesses and individuals). And they should be called out so people know not to support them in the future since they gambled with people's safety and lives.
Sure you have a right to your opinion as you stand on your soap box lecturing. I don´t put much stock in the opinions of snowbirds and tourists. You are here in the good times and gone in the bad and love to tell people how much you don´t know. Enjoy your soap box snowbird.
"I think that right now the times are not that good for anyone on the planet. Is there anyone on this forum who is not feeling a pretty big disruption in their usual activities, including the above mentioned snowbirds?"
{I don't put much stock in the opinions of snowbirds and tourists}PV/TA might not be the best fit for you then. Because that is mostly who is on this forum.
LOL snowbirds TIL
"Look guys. I know many of you love Vallarta and there are concrete ways you can really help.You can donate to the Vallarta Food Bank through their GoFundme campaign. Easy to find or PayPal. Pam Thompson-Webb and a group are helping to provide so that the Hospitals have masks and bed sheets, etc, etc. Deana777 posted info on how to do that, from near or far (Paypal).If you want to support the Jewish community, they are giving food baskets and other help to the needy (Chabad Vallarta).Please add other worthy charities anyone.Please give. Stop arguing, finger-pointing, chatting.That's what we're doing.Edited: 5:44 pm, March 31, 2020 "
"If you are friends with people who own businesses in PV, you may be personally asked to contribute to a gofundme for the employees, that's what I have done so far along this long road of potential to help. Or you can go to any of those Careyoslib mentioned, and there will be more. Our dollars can provide a lot."
"Vallarta Food Bank = just started 3 days ago. They even did a run to Mismaloya to feed the children last night. Apparently one boy was knocking on a door of a local at 10pm. He was hungry. Another local contacted Jimmy Plouff who started this new non-profit. Jimmy Plouff said, “Hook us up, we’ll be right on it tonight!” They got a head count, gathered the food and supplies and took off. Here is yesterday’s entry from “Go Fund Me”: Today 70 families were served at our food bank, plus 4 deliveries after closing time! The line started forming outside our doorway way before opening time, and by the time we finished helping everyone, the shelves were empty. More shopping tomorrow for Jimmy :) A special thanks to the volunteers today. If anyone would like to volunteer, please send us a message on our FB page, so we can schedule everyone accordingly to avoid overcrowding. Thank you! (Bring your own mask and gloves please)Currently, the food bank is opened between 12-3pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. We also do deliveries to surrounding areas as needed.Our location: Rio de la Plata 379, Col. Lopez Mateos, Puerto Vallarta. A big thank you to everyone who donated and shared our campaign. Please continue to help share our campaign because the next few months will be very difficult for the people in our community. With your contribution, we can make a big difference. Here are the ways to make a donation:— Make a donation online at GoFundMe— Make a donation via PayPal account (send us a message for the account information)—Make a cash donationPlease be assure that 100% of your donation will go toward the food bank.

"I went to get groceries in PV yesterday and Mega was very quiet, maybe 20 customers, all staff wearing masks, hand sanitizer everywhere. No signs of hoarding, shelves fully stocked. The malecon was quiet, and the few restaurants that were still open had only a few customers, all socially distanced from each other; staff wore surgical masks and hand sanitizer for everyone. Many restaurants were doing this weeks before the gov't issued isolation measures. In Canada restaurants are only doing takeout but are allowed up to 50 people on site at any time. So if you get takeout or delivery in Canada/US, please don't judge people here for going to an uncrowded restaurant."
"We’re in the US and in my town take out is not the same as sitting in a restaurant. It’s brought to you in the parking lot. Although must say we’re afraid to even do that, my husband has only done it twice and myself not at all in 3 weeks.  It is supposed to be safe with the proper packaging removal precautions. Maybe some restaurants in PV are bringing take out to the sidewalk. A person can certainly ask for that when they order."
"Pre- virus, our restaurants which offered take out, had an area where you could sit for a moment or so until they finished packaging your take out if you got there too soon. Now you call them from the parking area, tell them you are there, and they will bring it out to you. No, take out for me is not sitting at a table. Guess it differs according to where you are?"
"Construction sites are still working. There is construction on Hortensias and construction up on Gardenias at a condo building up there. There are construction workers walking up and some in pickups, clearly not keeping social distance. Apparently the suggestions to keep people safe do not apply to developers. They are putting their workers at risk and Puerto Vallarta."
"Where we are, take out is brought to your car, you're not going into the restaurant at all. We have a 15 person limit, not 50."
"We are a large twin city and the central metropolitan core has 3 counties. Every restaurant has been closed to the public for 2 weeks, an amazing thing for the size. Only take out/delivery allowed. Today is review day, so we'll see what they decide."
"In my part of US, all restaurants closed, take out only. No more than 10 people to gather. Construction sites all closed. Boston essentially on total lock down except essential. This has been for over a week."
"I wonder why if there are so many restrictions to social life in the US, there are so many COVID 18 cases?"
"I think the basic answer is that ""stay home"" and restaurant closings weren't started early enough in some areas."
"I agree with Kansas, Stay at home and closures were not soon enough and done by counties as oposed to states or whole of country etc. Mexico will see large numbers as well but there is hope of less if folks heed the Stay at Home order."
Also USA moves at a very fast pace.
"yet another good point Miguel A. Forgot about that, been here so long. I do know I am totally stressed and out of my element in states. :)"
"Dreamer, where in Canada are you? 50 people? really, I think not? even little city of Victoria everything is closed. Take out to car only. Hillary, go blow your nose elsewhere. Kansas, maybe greed was the incorrect word, either way any joint that is still open and allowing people in will not get a nickle of mine again EVER! There is a reason Gov's have ordered them close and so they should. Think...this could be over in three weeks if every person stayed at home. Oh and yes I have gave to many charities , PV included since this has happened and I am not a wealthy man by any means."
"skipper, I think it being over in 3 weeks is overly optimistic. And I bet it spikes again, I truly believe that.Edited: 8:10 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"KansasPVgal are you saying that you think this has spiked?Clarify your response please. Or did you mean it will spike again next winter?Not judging just curious of others opinions, my opinion is that we are not even close to a spike yet (thats coming soon and will boggle most minds). As far as a spike next winter or fall, only way that will happen is if we start to see reinfection, hopefully not."
"KrazySask - Spike wasn't a good word for me to use. I meant if the curve gets flattened, I bet it will come back next fall. I know that's not keeping positive thoughts, I'm just trying to be realistic. I'd rather be surprised if I get to go in December, than disappointed."
"Cabo is truly shutting down pre-Semana Santa; all lodging (hotels, timeshares, etc.) are ordered to be vacated by April 6. I wonder if other governors will follow suit."
"My dr and I just had a friend to friend, medical professional to medical professional talk on Covid 19. What do you think of this virus? His response was it scares me, truly scares me. No one has a crstal ball but there are 3 scenarios possible. It mutates and disappears by June or so, similar to what happened with SARS. It comes in waves, spikes and peaks with the fall and start of cold weather being a terrible spike. A vaccine is made and we recover. His suggestions and he is affiliated in USA Brighams & Womens and I believe Mass General as well as many other areas of USA along with Mexico. Social distancing and his words American distancing not Mexican. Stay home as much as possible. If you have to go to grocery store or such absolutely use a mask. Gloves are debatable as too many people do not know how to use properly. If using hand sanitizer and not water and soap keep rubbing it for 20 seconds. We did hand bump, elbow bump, foot bump lije in China and a handshake. We usuallu hug. Travel totally off the table at least until June, might be longer depending what happens with this stay at home and the spike which has not even begun in Mexico. No guarantees as no one knows so one day at a time. He said shoes you wear outside leave outside do not bring in house. I asked about my husband coming and he said from Boston, a good month and half or more but again day by day. Take Vit D...critical for folks like me but helpful to all likely. I already take it he knows, but told me to tell my family. Beyond that we just shared personal opinions beyond what I have shared.This compares to nothing anyone alive has experienced."
"Off topic but I wish Trip Advisor had a thing where you automatically went to the next message that you have not read yet. As far as distancing not being a Mexican thing. Well, it isn't an Italian thing either. I think it is more a problem of not wanting to believe (denial), and a bad habit of not listening/reading the news. Especially in adults."

"Good points Bezerk, vit D and C everyday, shoes outside that you wear out and about, I have been doing this for a long time already. Mexico has done a good thing with this shutdown but I fear crime will rise as when people become used to a certain income it is hard to go without, of course this is true anywhere you live not just Mexico. I am not saying everyone will turn to crime, but lots will out of necessity.As most know by now chinas #s on this are totally bogus and why the msm still base their mortality rate on this scares me. If anyone here looks at any live case counter maps online and does some simple math on a random pick of countries, the death rate of infected will not be 2 to 4 % as predicted of total cases. Though it is hard to clarify until more exact truthful data comes in I am guessing it will end up being double that prediction by doing the math as many cases are not resolved yet in any random pick unless something changes in the current trajectory we are heading in. Remember govt never tells the whole truth to ""protect"" you.All opinions on this welcome and appreciated."
Not sure what you mean Miguel. I don't see anything. What I would like is … since TA knows who I am when I am on the site; it would be nice if in each category I could just go to my last unread message.
"On the forum page, just look to the far right of the list of threads...which is a column titled ""last post"". Click on the time, NOT the name below it of the person who posted last, and it will take you immediately to the end of the thread. But maybe you already knew that."
"KrazzySask. Just MHO they are not reporting how many people have passed from the flu alone. Hundreds of people die each year in BC from the flu, but I've yet to hear those numbers separated. As stated to date 25 people in BC have died from CV-19 But how many from the flu? Are we really getting the full reality of this bug? Really like your comment on all opinions are welcome! That is what forms are about! I take B-12 C and D everyday but haven't been leaving my shoes outside, but will start today. Good info Bezerk"
To Bezerks #58 post. My sister in law is a Respiratory Therapist and they are required at the hospital they work at to leave shoes they wear for work in their locker and to NOT wear them home. They also need to change out of scrubs and wear other clothes home as well as necessary precautions. She carries her scrubs home in a sealed bag and they go right into the washing machine.
"gopkrs..the advise given for your request works if you are on a computer/ laptop, not cell phone just so you know. :)Sue C, yes Dr told me that info too but I did not share as was more medical professiobal oriented totally. They do say to take off your clothes you go out in and wash right away before sitting anywhere in your house.Edited: 4:56 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Skipper although this was from the States but the President mentioned that 34,000 die from the flu every year. The projections from CV19 deaths may exceed 250,000 and are at around 85,000 now. I guess in Canada the ratio may be similar in that more deaths will happen from CV19."
"#64 Skipper. Where did you get your information from? You said hundreds have died from the flu in BC alone. That's not true, this season (week 35 2019 to week 12 2020) 41 people have died in Canada. Your numbers are way off. There were more than 54,000 laboratory detections of the flu in Canada this season; over 2300 hepatizations. Death rate less than 0.1%. Covid 19 is not the flu, far from it. https:/…fw2019-20-wk12-en.pdfhttps:/…week-12-march-15-21-2020.htmlEdited: 5:18 pm, April 02, 2020 "
Edit above 2300 hospitalizations.
"krazzySacks..so hard to respond on cell phone as I cannot look back at post, but am being discharged from hospital today so will soon be back on computer. Vit. C, you can take as a pill or just drink a glass of OJ daily. I am on high doses due to compromised immune system. Vit D is good for helping prevent cancer cells from clustering and has known properties to destroy viruses especially by as in Cobid 19, destroying the outer fatty covering. The Sun vitamin. Miracle vitamin. Dr reinfoced this morning, use of mask, gloves if you are willing to learn proper way to use them, otherwise hand sanitizer often when out like every 20 minutes or more. Stay home as much as possible and when out use 6 feet of social distancing. The Mexican Culture, unlike the American culture does not have a sense or need for space so thus social distancing for many may just mean being a foot or two away as they culturally are close. That was one of my hardest things to learn initially in the culture. People would almost be touching me in line in a store which to American culture invades our space, lol. I had to learn though as otherwise I thought someone was trying to get in my pocketbook all the time lol. Thankfully I am a hugger so that was easy but I am finding that a hard habit to break or hold in now for safety. Restaurants I was told totally off limits unless delivery or take out.In spite of all this, my dr. is optomistic on a vaccine in not too distant future. He is also saying he feels we will see this in waves for a bit and the second wave may be worst than the first. He agreed with me on Hope, jut hope. He does think or hopes some travel can or might resume in a few months but come August/ September may be bad here again. Colder places will, he thinks get hit again in fall. Again speculation. He did reitterate the importance of all the measures I mentioned especially here in Mexico where we have not even begun to see anything yet but within a few weeks, a spike will likely happen and hopefully these measures will buy time and lower the spike and bring us to a flattening of curve quicker. Once again we spoke of no crystal balls and so just do as asked, take precautions and hope, beyong hope. Guadalajara at night is a ghost town. In ambulance today going for special test, we spoke of essential qorkers and just folks who need to work to eat. Equivalent here in Mexico as in the states.Crime likely will increase everywhere. People are out of jobs in Mexico as they are also in the states. It is all relative.Catch you all later from home. I am now to be released, actually kind of scary."
Is there any reliable source for COVID-19 statistics for Puerto Vallarta?
"No, there are no reliable sources."
MAW0101 #72Are saying the Mexican government doesn't release any updates?
"No, not exactly. There will be data but it will not be reliable. Reliable data isn’t easy to get anywhere."
There is lots of information available. There is one confirmed death. But it is up to people to do their own searching.

Good links Krazzy. I sure hope Mexico recovers very quickly!!
"MAW0101 #24I agree with you. I searched and found widely different numbers, That is why I was looking for an ""Official Site"".I don't trust the numbers in the in the U.S.; why should I trust them in Mexico.I did find a website on wikipedia that looked like it provided legitimate information. I trust wikipedia because it is self regulated .I hope this information will help travelers and locals understand the local conditions.Below is a link to the Mexican epidemic by wikipedia..I call it a Mexican epidemic because they were slow to recognize it was a worldwide pandemic.I feel they have come around and are taking necessary procedures to combat this as the pandemic that it is,Pray for a swift end to this pandemic. We are all in this together, whether you are Mexican, United States or Canadian or another nationally.As Benjamin Franklin once said, ""We must hang together or we will all hang separately"",Hopefully Mexico will adopt strict enforcement of closing businesses, prohibit gatherings of 10 or more persons and enforce the rules of Social Distancing.

Mexican news media have ongoing real time data for Covid19.
careyeroslib 375Where do I search to find this data? Do you have a source?littlemomma_1955Same question. What news services should I be looking at?I think it is important for travelers to know the impact of COVID-19 in Mexico and Puerto Vallarta in particular.
"re #80 ""I think it is important for travelers to know the impact of COVID-19 in Mexico and Puerto Vallarta in particular.""I am sure everyone wants to know what the impact will be on puerto vallarta and for that matter everywhere else, you will have plenty of time to do your research and sum up your report to the masses about the impact to p v as it will be at a few months or more (leaning to the more) before any analysis can be even be remotely rendered unless your boots, so to speak are on the ground right in pv, sorry to say, good luck with that."
"All Beaches in Mexico are officially closed, so thus no people on beach. Mexico has dealt with epidemics so some experience going into a pandemic. Has any country handled it right or timely enough? Only time will tell.Edited: 2:49 am, April 03, 2020 "
"krazzySask #81Thank you for your postI was asking for information about the current situation.I never mentioned writing s report. Where did you fabricate that sentence?Poster number 1 quoted there was one death. If he had that statistic he must have done some research. I was asking where he got his data.Poster number 2 said the Mexican media was publishing information. I simply asked what was her source and what media should I be looking at.And again, thank for you your comment.I hope my answer has clarified my post.Let us both pray Puerto Vallarta and everyone everywhere survives this pandemic."

"#84@krazzySask, don't waste your time. There's abundant and redundant Covid-19 trackers available online and anyone with half a brain has immediate access to them. Some people just have a bone to pick and you can rub facts and numbers on their priesthole and they'll just rob you of your will to live. Don't feed the trolls. This is a resource I'd like to make available: if anyone needs a Covid-19 test in Mexico here's the official link:https://test.covid19.cdmx.gob.mx/This might be for CDMX but it's a good place to start.Edited: 11:35 am, April 03, 2020 "
