Is the road open? Why not if not? Who is in control of the area?Thx!
There is a local newspaper that has some articles that may be of help to youhttps://mammothtimes.com/
"Here is also the county virus information sitehttps://coronavirus.monocounty.ca.gov/Edited: 8:57 pm, June 22, 2020 "
"Yes the ""road"" is open, if you mean the 203. Most of Mammoth is open."
"Im asking about the road to the Lakes area, not Mammoth town. The article is over two weeks old, but the Mono county site is good, I’ve been checking that for weeks"

"Road opened this morning! Lakes were pumping, bunch of boats out on Lake Mary"
