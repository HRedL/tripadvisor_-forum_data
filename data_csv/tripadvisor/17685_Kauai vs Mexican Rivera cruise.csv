"I know this is apples and oranges, just bear with me ;-)I have the option between the two next August and I can’t decide. It would be my 13th trip to Hawaii (3rd to Kauai) and first ever cruise. I’ve been to Cabo years ago, and this cruise goes to Cabo, mazatlan and puerto Vallarta. I ADORE Kauai, obviously. But a change of pace is tempting. Has anyone done this cruise before...after many trips to Hawaii will I be sorely dissapointed? I know it’s so subjective, but I am just hoping for opinions of any and all kinds.Thanks greatly in advance."
"I have done both more times than I can count.Do the cruise this time since you have never done it before. Make sure you do the excursions that ""the ships"" offer for safety, efficiency and quality of time in the ports. They are worth it almost all the time."
"I've been travelling to both Kauai and Mexico for decades ( Puerto Vallarta and Cabo). My last time in Cabo was just this past October. For a point of reference it had been about 8 years since I was previously there. A lot changed in those few years and it was somewhat of a letdown. Completely built up, one after another of flashy resorts neck in neck along the beautiful coastline. People think Kauai has been built up but it's nothing like this. More people and a lot more nightlife. The town of San Lucas is hopping in the evenings. The biggest difference was seeing armed militia all around - at the resort entrances, up and down the coastal highway, and in town. Sure, it's a good thing they're there but it wasn't the place I remembered and loved. Word is the cartels have made their way over the Sea of Cortez to Baja. I've never been to Mazatlan but have been to P.V. many times. Still my favorite spot in Mexico even though it too has become built up. Again, lots of nightlife now.So it all depends on what you want to get out of your cruise. You say you're looking for that change of pace you'd certainly get it with these resort areas in Mexico. It's a stark contrast for me when I compare a stay on Kauai compared to Mexico. You can expect a more lively and party type atmosphere there.Edited: 2 years ago "
Kauai and PV are my two most frequent vacation destinations. As above they are very different and each wonderful. The one thing to consider about PV in August is the humidity is intense. This may not be such an issue since you will be out at sea quite a bit and presumably have air conditioning.
Do you like to cruise? My son just got back from PV two weeks ago and said he might as well have been in H*ll it was so dang hot. No way would go anywhere near Mexico in the summer. No No No!!!
Good points made about the weather. I'd missed the part about it being an August trip. Hotter in Mexico than in Hawaii in August. The big difference being Hawaii normally has those tradewinds out in the middle of the Pacific. You won't see breezes to the same degree in Mexico.
"The one thing that would concern me about the cruise in that region in August is the hurricane potential. The Pacific has been pretty active the last few years, and being on a cruise ship in the middle of a storm is miserable. I know from personal experience."
"I am often faced with this dilema and always choose Kauai. The ports in LA and San Diego are driving distance for me and I keep trying to get myself to choose a mexican cruise. I don't think I would choose a mexican cruise in August. And I have heard too many horror stories to feel safe there. But if you have never cruised before, it is really a fun experience. But I wanted to throw the idea out there that you should also check cruises going out of galveston and new orleans. It is suprisingly cheap to get to those two places and then you can catch a cruise somewhere other than Mexico, likely on a better ship. And then I might choose that over Kauai."
"The heat issue would seal the deal for me. Come on back; honeymoon on Kaua`i.Upgrade to a luxury resort, add some special activities, pamper yourself, etc. to make this time different and extra-memorable."
"Decisions decisionsI thank you all for your feedback, you’ve given me a great deal of things to think about.Jet~ not a honeymoon! We’ve been married 9 years already, although we did honeymoon in Hawaii! This is a family trip. And it’d be a return trip to HBR"
"I’d go to Kauai over a cruise in heartbeat but I’ve been on several Mexico cruises. I used to love Cabo but it’s changed so much it doesn’t even seem like the same place to me anymore. I do like the area closer to San Jose Del Cabo, near the Cabo Surf Hotel but the port area is so over built it’s not enjoyable to me any more. What I can’t stand about cruises is the time schedule. I don’t like leaving the beach because I have to. If you think that would bother you Kauai might be what you want even though it’s not something new.  Which cruise line? Some are much better than others.Edited: 2 years ago "
My family had a house in Puerto Vallarta for decades and you couldn't get me there on a bet in August. The humidity is oppressive.Go to Kauai.
"Ive never cruised before but I personally love new experiences so I’d almost always choose the new. And, Puerta Vallarta is pretty high on my list of places to visit. However, you mentioned already having been to Cabo so what about a cruise to the Quintana Roo area of Mexico instead? Cancun/playa Del Carmen/Isla mujeres/tulum/Cozumel are gorgeous. Don’t know if that’s an option just throwing that out there. I like the previous poster’s idea about traveling out of a different port. New Orleans is AMAAAAAZING and would certainly add a lot of interest if it were me. I’m always trying to compare apples and oranges when planning trips too. It’s tough. I wish happy travels for you no matter what you choose!"
"Oh.... and if you are not already a member, go join Cruise Critic and ask over there.https:/…"
How about a cruise to Alaska?
"It’s carnival because it’s the only one open from the Long Beach port for the dates I’m off from work.I want to cruise from the east coast badly since the Caribbean is HIGH on my list and I’ve never been but traveling from Northern California adds a huge expense...so there’s that. With Long Beach we could avoid airfare and drive to the port.A cruise has never been something I’ve dreamed of...But I like the idea of seeing many places at once, on one trip. Bali Hai is calling though..."
"Isn't Carnival the cruise line that's got a party reputation? Had some epidemic breakouts too? Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know much about cruises but I just remember something like this in the news, on more than one occasion."
It’s the cruise line I always said I’d avoid if I went on a cruise because of its reputation...but it’s the only one during the two weeks off I have next August.
"Oh . . . I do want to try a cruise someday . . . but in August, the northshore of Kauai and HBR would definitely be the win in this case. Now if you were going in January or February, I would say give Mexico a try, but summer in Kauai is heaven on earth, and especially as a family vacation. :)"
"<<""How about a cruise to Alaska?"">>Alaska sounds very refreshing right about now!"
"For me this is an easy choice. Kauai all the way. I’m biased tho both ways. I absolutely love Kauai and hate cruises. A cruise, to me,is so limiting. I like to hike in nauture, sit on a quiet beach with no crowds, eat fresh local fish and foods......all Kauai. A cruise is a floating Petri dish of germs. Seems like there’s a Noro virus outbreak every month in the news on these major cruise lines. Buffets are just not an option for me though I know they have other options. Food was meh. Excursions limited to days in port and availability. That’s just me though. And Carnival would not work for me. My dad does some really neat cruises on smaller boats that are something I might try one day, but never at the expense of a trip to Kauai."
Cruise to Alaska is a great idea! :)
"I’ve been to all three locations in Mexico, albeit not on a cruise. I would pick Kauai every time. No comparison. And no diarrhea.."
We have done the 4 night cruise on carnival out of long beach twice. Kauai 3 times. The cruise is cheaper but if money isn't an issue I would always pick Kauai. I do tire of the whole family stuck in one cruise cabin but can't bear to put the kids in a cabin without me. I worry about rape on cruises with three girls alone in a cabin. So it is always a tight fit in Kauai we get a separate bedroom at minimum. I also prefer the freedom on our Hawaii trips.
We are off to Alaska for a couple weeks tomorrow for a cruise. Goodbye humidity!
"Enjoy, Jenz. Your comment is exactly why I won't go to Hawaii OR Mexico in the summer. The humidity kills me. My first choice is always to stay home at that time of year or drive up to Tahoe."
"I get you, Napa. We try to plan our annual vacation in August, as the weather is nice pretty much everywhere and we have already had our fill of humidity here. Love the Tahoe region, visited several times for both work and play.I have not heard great things about Carnival, and I know cruise lines in general put their older boats in that region as it is not that popular and they don't have a ton of pricing power. Thus why you can get a great price on a cruise, especially if you don't have to hop on an airplane to get there. Quite honestly I would choose here over that particular cruise, and try and do the cruise you really want to do at some point in the future."
"I appreciate all the responses. It gave me a lot to think about and talk to my husband about and I’m the end we have chosen to stay with Hawaii. I don’t think we are “cruise” people, although never haven cruised I can’t be 100%, but I think that if and when we try it will be the Caribbean.So again, thank you, and see you on Kauai next August!"
"You made the same choice I would make. I am sitting in a house in Hanalei right now. It does not have a/c but I've used my blanket every night! It's not cold but the trade winds are keeping everything cool. I'm here with my husband and 5 teen boys and no one has complained about heat.I've been to Mexico a few times and enjoyed it. I've cruised once (Royal Caribbean out of Puerto Rico) and really didn't like it. We'll never cruise again unless it's a small specialty cruise. Our problem with the cruise is we never wanted to return to the ship. We love to linger on the beach at sunset, find a little dive bar in the evening, pick up some fresh fish for dinner, drive around in a little jeep and pull off whenever we want, time doesn't matter. These are our favorite things and they aren't possible on a cruise."
"I am not sure if I will like a typical cruise either - mostly I think it is the mass of people and activities that I would not enjoy, though I think my spouse would love it! I recently did a boat trip in the Galapagos, but it was only 16 passengers and I discovered I LOVED being on a boat. But the islands in the Galapagos aren't like Hawaii . .. most are very barren, so day trips to the islands were fine. I loved being lulled to sleep on the boat every night. I came home, and started researching more small boat cruises - the only thing is most are very expensive. sigh. Enjoy Kauai honeymooner! :)Edited: 2 years ago "
"Coalminer, that sounds amazing! More my style too I think."
It was totally amazing. :)
