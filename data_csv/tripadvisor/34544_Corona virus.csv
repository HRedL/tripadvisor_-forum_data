"Hey guys, I am from Malaysia and I am planning to travel to Amritsar until the following Thursday. I happened to come across the below article regarding a possible travel ban:https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhâ€¦In that case, is it still ok to travel to Amritsar for the week? Much appreciate if anyone can input on this.Thanks =)"
">> Much appreciate if anyone can input on this. <<The article mentions an appeal ""to request a ban on travel to countries with a large number of COVID-19 cases"".I don't see how that could interfere with your plan to travel to Amritsar."
"There is no travel ban as of now. However, that situation is too fluid to predict with certainty.I have to point out that arrivals from Malaysia were among the first set of travellers to be screened in India, before it was extended to all arrivals."
