"there seems to be alot of mention of wasps and bees at the gala resort, has there been an epidemic of them this year, or are the reorted instances of them on trip advisor "" over quoted"""
"there was a lot when we were there in july. they are at the bars and the buffet and floating in the juices at breakfast, one of the kids got stung as they were on the floor half dead and he stood on it . your rooms will be fine and anywhere there is no sugary drinks. be aware that the bar staff will just scoope them out and serve the drinks (just make sure you see your drink being served) do not drink the welcome drinks as you dont know what has been scooped out of it!"
It was the same as drummer61 mentioned when we were at the Barcelo in January. My wife got bit twice on the foot while waiting for our shuttle at the airport. I think tit just comes with the territory as they say. Just use caution. Fogu.
"Yeah yeah, they are there. Do not swat at them and they don't hurt you. Was there 2/8 to 9/8 and no one was stung. Never saw one in the drinks. They are not flies and taste very nice if you get the chance. "
Does anyone have any idea what the wasps and bees are like in February? I an allergic and would like to be aware before I go.
"Been there in February the last two years, and can't remember seeing any wasps or bees ever."
