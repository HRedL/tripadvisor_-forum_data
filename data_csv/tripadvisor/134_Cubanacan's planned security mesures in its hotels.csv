"Here is what they plan to implement when they open again. Let's see if the ""dream"" will meet the reality... As we know, many Cubans don't have the same sens of details we do...https:/…"
"Gengen: for the benefit of those of us who cannot watch one and a half hours of Mesa Redonda, interpret, and digest it, could we ask you for a summation of the highlights?"
"Sorry! Wrong link! It's a 5 minutes video! And now, I cannot copy the link to the video. But anyone can access Cubanacan FB page and watch it: https://www.facebook.com/CubanacanHoteles/And I will be grateful if someone less technologically challenged then me can post the direct link.For what I remember: distance of 1.5-2m between tables, seats, chairs, etc anywhere in the hotel. No bar of any type. Buffet with proportioned starters and desert and employee serving the rest. And lots of assurance that they will clean everything many times daily..."
A link in English would be best for all.
"I have no seen an English version yet. I think that they are targeting the Cuban market first, because they are suppose to open the national tourism before the international."
"I understand Gen, but when/ if they do post what it will be like for International travelers it would be much appreciated if it would be posted here in English ( or translated into English ) , esp. if it is in video forum."
Will do! SWNova!
"post #2""And lots of assurance that things will be cleaned many times daily! We are talking about a Major over hall of the system. Have you ever been in the kitchen of any resort.? Holy Dyna!You think the kitchen of the ala carte might be better??? Lets start with a few sticks of dynamite."
"I watched that 6 minute video. They did a very nice job. But too freaky. And, sorry to say, if that video is for the Cuban crowd, it is for the 1%ers. I can see it happening in a few 5 star Cuban resorts, bueno, but anything lower, i can't see it."
Yes fantasy land.
Don't get me wrong! Seeing what goes on behind the saloon doors to the kitchen never stopped us from entering the Dinning Hall. The responsibility is on the client as well to make the right choices and decisions when eating there. Cuba is Not the only country that has to step up its game.

Fantasy land indeed. Great in theory but not a chance that's how it will be in practice.
"Talk about overkill. If you're there in the first place, you're obviously okay with a little risk. Wash your hands, don't kiss strangers and don't lick your fingers. You'll be fine."
Just seing how reckless most Cubans are in the street with social distancing and the wearing of the mask... I don't see 20% of those mesures being respected by the staff nor the client after the first week.
I imagine the same applies to casas particulares?? Glad I won't have to worry about any of that... I'll just need someone to bring my beer to me by the carton for my casa if they can find it.Terry
"Have you ever watched the bartenders wipe out the cup of the guy ahead of you with a rag, maybe wipe the bar with it afterwards and then wipe out your cup with the same rag, maybe after having rinsed it under the tap. If you have survived that, you can survive almost anything!"
"What is described in the video only applies to Cubanacan hotels. Most of those mesures are not mandatory, they are a choice made by Cubanacan. Of course casas particulares will not have the same standards.Personally, I don't see the CP opening and ""free"" tourism happening for a while. Not until other countries have the situation under control. And right now, the sources for most of the ""free travellers"" really don't have the virus control controlled."
"And I have to correct something. The bars and snack bars will not be closed. But it will not be possible to order from the bar, you will have to get your orders from the staff attending tables. I agree Mike that All inclusive without bar service would not make sense."
"No doubt that Cuba will be completely rid of the virus ahead of many other countries. When looking at that worldometers site now, it's encouraging to see how many countries are now showing ""0"" new cases and/or active cases (smaller countries at the bottom of the list, but still, very encouraging). Cuba will get there too... and perhaps that will dictate the pace on when the government will reopen the country to receive foreigners again... with those many proactive measures in place to limit the reoccurrence of the virus on the island.https:/…countriesTerry"
Hopefully there is not a second wave In November as this article talks about https:/…
"As soon as the first three cases were announced in Cuba, some 500 km from Gibara, almost all casas started a disenfecting protocol. We put a basin and a bottle of bleach on a table by the door and anyone entering had to rinse their hands. For the first time ever we boiled water to wash all the dishes and cutlery used at breakfast. Once the tourists left the casa, whether they returned or not, everything in their rooms were wiped down with bleach and once a day, everything in the patio that may have been touched was also disenfected. We had complaints about the bleach smell in the rooms. Some complained that we were changing their sheets and scrubbing down the bathrooms every day.Ya' can't win for losing."
'Experts' and models/graphs? I still have not seen one that is correct. They are all just guessing.
@22 I guess some are treating COVID-19 as a cholera ...
