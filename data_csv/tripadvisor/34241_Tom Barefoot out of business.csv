I heard that Tom Barefoot is out of business permanently and not doing Refunds.... so if you have something booked you will have to go through credit card to try and get refunded. Just an FYI
So sad. Thanks for sharing TB
"Will be many more businesses folding if the ban on tourism doesn't end. The governor can choose to either protect those that are vulnerable to the virus (mostly elderly and/or with major health issues) or protect the economy and businesses. Both can be accomplished if the vulnerable are willing to isolate themselves (no visitors to nursing homes, etc.) while the rest of the world gets on with their lives."

I'm not surprised.
"totally misinformed, ignorant, naive and dangerous comment. The vulnerable are now 51 and older, young children and infants. That's without a mutation and assuming you are not asymptomatic. Your type of attitude will help spread the virus."

"i'm quoting Gov. Cuomo N.Y. Governor at his daily press conference. He follows the science and facts, not wants, emotions and internet ""doctors""."
"So, you have no data to back any of that silly rant up I see. Maybe you should just delete it and move on.Maybe come back when you have some facts to substantiate your rants.Edited: 10:10 am, May 09, 2020 "
"With all due respect, placebets, it goes both ways. Referring to a coronavirus as “the Chinese flu” is scientifically and semantically incorrect. Using that verbiage lends less value to your own arguments.~ Colleen"
"Csatu from Pennsylvania,You might wish to validate your source of information. Do you realize that in your state of Pennsylvania, up to 80% of all COVID 19 deaths are from Long Term Care Facilities? I suspect that you voted for your incompetent Governor. Perhaps your state has the wrong focus. I hope he is not using the information that you believe to be true to make the tough decisions."
"jplrk how is it ""scientifically"" incorrect ? I guess you have a problem with call the Spanish flu the ""Spanish flu"" ? Or how about the West Nile virus, or Ebola ? Those OK with you ?"
"google the info., i'm not going to do it for you. up to 80%? then what are the other 20%? multiple that by 300 million people in the U.S.. way to bring politics in to it. don't worry, your President said there would only be 15 cases and it would go away. had to rebut your insane logic."
"""up to 80%"" ? what is up to 80% ?what are the ""other 20%"" ? and by the way there are more than 300 million people in the US. I didn't bring politics in to it.And, in case you haven't heard, he's your president too.So, you have no facts, you have no data, just spouting BS. Try harder next time OK ?"
"The current pandemic isn’t the product of an influenza virus, placebets. Terming it a “flu” is therefore scientifically incorrect. Pretty simple. ~ Colleen"
Time to stop placebets.

"""totally misinformed, ignorant, naive and dangerous comment. The vulnerable are now 51 and older, young children and infants. That's without a mutation and assuming you are not asymptomatic. Your type of attitude will help spread the virus.""That is not correct at all. There has not been an issue at all with children. There may be a handful of cases, but nothing near the regular flu. The majority of cases have been nursing homes. Those are what need to be focused on. Outside of nursing homes, the overwhelming majority of hospitalizations and deaths have been elderly and people with serious health issues. Again, focus on protecting those people and let everybody else get back to normal life. This virus isn't going away any time soon."
"73 kids now very sick in New York with Kawasaki's disease. Remains to be seen if it's related to the virus but very well could be. It's not a common disease.There are many many folks who have underlying conditions. Any cancer patient, those with heart disease, any organ failure patients, anyone with an auto immune disease such as lupus or rhumitoid arthritis. Asthmatics, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy. Yes, let's push everyone of theses folks out of the way because heaven forbid I need to get on with MY life."
"csatu, I appreciate your sentiment. The ""it is just the old and infirm"" messaging started right out of the gate and persists to this day. Troubling on a number of levels.For those interested in data, here is some made publicly available by Texas Health and Human Services.COVID-19 cases by age<30 20%30-39 18%40-49 19%50-59 18%60+ 24%Unk 1%COVID-19 fatalities by age<30 0.5% 30-39 2.0%40-49 4.4%50-59 10.4%60+ 11.6% Plenty of younger people are suffering from this virus. Doubt those in their 50s will find the mortality rate comforting. Also, mortality is not the only health-related outcome to be concerned about.""You know the whole quarantine thing was not intended to stop people from getting the Chines flu, it was to keep the number low enough so it did not overwhelm our health system."" Stopping people from being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is precisely how to keep numbers low enough that our health system is not overwhelmed."
"PracticeAloha808 I appreciate your information but I'm having a problem with the fatalities by age data.Shouldn't the total add up to 100% ? Unless I'm missing something your numbers add to less that 30% total.Can you look and either explain the data, or post other data if this is incorrect, or just provide the link for the data ?I'm especially surprised that the % for 60 and over is about the same as 50-59."
"“I see, so it's the Chinese virus....I'm OK with that but I think Chinese flu is close enough even if not ""scientifically' perfect.”It’s not a matter of being scientifically perfect. Terminology and labeling matters, as I’m sure you’re well aware. There’s no reason, other than irresponsibility or intentional provocation, to refer to the current pandemic as a flu if in fact it isn’t influenza. And there’s no value in referring to it as the “Chinese” virus. But again, you know that.~ Colleen"
"I'm not educated, but I've submitted enough business plans to financial institutions to know that if you're quoting stats you need to identify your sources and verify that they are accurate.If I'm quoting Covid information I'm looking at CDC numbers and State health agency reports. To be fair I did quote numbers from the New York Governors press conference. All this information is easy to access through the internet. I'm guessing you all have the internet right.....If you're looking for lets say Hawaii's covid numbers I suggest going to google type in Hawaii's covid numbers and just like magic they will appear. I just did it 629 reported cases 565 recoveries 17 deaths none reported yesterday.This should work for each state.....You are welcome. hahahahahahaEdited: 12:15 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"How is any of the arguing about the semantics of what the virus is called have anything to do with Tom Barefoot going out of business?If you want to argue about that, do it on your social media or start a separate thread. I thought this forum was for Maui-related travel topics."
"OK you are right...Tom Barefoot is out of business as was said in the first few replies. Now, what other questions or comments do you have regarding Tom Barefoot being out of business ? We are all ears …."
placebets Your blunt post is probably better suited over on the Las Vegas forum. In the future please remember to identify what forum you're addressing.Las Vegas Forum: Blunt Post goodMaui Forum: Blunt Post BadThank You and have wonderful day.
"""I thought this forum was for Maui-related travel topics.""This is the new normal. ;-)~ Colleen"
"S E, you haven't been around long enough to learn the nuances of the Maui forums or the Hawaii forums!! TA guidelines aren't very strict and since the pandemic, almost anything goes. You certainly have a right and a choice to post, you also have a right to skip anything you have no interest in. I personally am not a fan of others telling people what they can or cannot post."
"PB, the second part of PracticeAloha808 is the percent of those who get the virus that die in each age bracket.No need to add them up."
"Bottom line---tons of Business throughout all of Hawaii will close with out visitors from all over. Hawaii seems to have chosen to see and wait--Tough decision--wait and wait and wait while people and businesses go bankrupt and many in Hawaii take gov't money---or getting moving forward and hopefully business and people will make it. Sensing the sit and wait tone of this board, I think we know what Hawaii and it's governor have chosen. It is very sad that so many friends and business owners we know throughout the islands are just watching their efforts go down the drain. SO very sad when Hawaii should be moving ahead and opening business to at least some degree!!!"
"dusty OK thanks for that clarification.So, if I read that correctly, all age groups seem to get the virus pretty evenly....but a higher percentage of those who get it die with it. That makes sense, but I'm still pretty unsure of the % that actually get the virus because testing is still so scattered and depends on the population that you test. Totally a disaster in the testing department if you ask me.Thanks for the help."
"""PB, the second part of PracticeAloha808 is the percent of those who get the virus that die in each age bracket.No need to add them up.""Thanks, Dusty! You are correct...PB's calculations couldn't possibly add up because they are not meant to. Those are mortality rates by age cohort."
"""I'm especially surprised that the % for 60 and over is about the same as 50-59."" PB, yep, that is the point. Age is a definite factor, but the age threshhold is rather low. Gotta love data! And now there are *unexplained* (my term) deaths among children. You can google it for yourself if it is of interest."
"I'm spending plenty of time with people I care about ~ well, those I can spend time with, anyway, but I couldn't let the ""Chinese flu"" slide. ;-D~ Colleen"
"I hear you, TB. I will now go back outside and continue working in the yard/garden. I came inside to escape the volume of my town's ""liberate us"" parade. Yep. Needless to say, I was forced to start cocktail hour early. ~ C."
"Glad you are enjoying your time TB4, we are too!!"
"I don't believe that it is constructive to label a flu or virus after what one might construe to be its origins. As many scientists and academics have agreed, it is unlikely that the Spanish Flu originated in Spain. It was labelled the Spanish flu as it hit Spain the hardest. Should we then rename the coronavirus after a country that is hit the hardest by its effect? I don't think so.Naming a flu or virus or any type of disease after a city or country is also pejorative and has the effect of belittling and degrading a country, pitting one set of people against another, causing divisiveness and escalating hatred and intolerance (which sadly, is what is taking place right now). This is not the world of which I want to be a part. I would hope that as the world experiences this virus and its resulting grief and carnage, we could come together, not grow further apart.I don't usually weigh in in these types of controversial topics, but some of the comments that I have seen and exchanged on this thread and others, have made my heart heavy. After moving to Canada (from India) at a young and impressionable age, I was personally assaulted and victimized - my sin was being and looking different. When I see and hear people using disparaging words that could hurt and wound, makes my heart shutter and shrink. Signing off, but not before wishing everyone love and hoping that we can all grow some compassion."
Well said Reau!!
"Exactly, Reau. There's no value to attaching the ""Chinese"" descriptor. I assumed, maybe incorrectly, that that was understood as one reason I spoke up. As an aside, the ""Spanish flu"" isn't so called because Spain was hit the hardest. That's an example of how labels can create misconceptions. ~ Colleen"
"You are quite right, Colleen, and thanks, sincerely for correcting me. I did a bit of a history check. “ Why Was The Spanish Flu Called The Spanish Flu?The Spanish Flu did not originate in Spain, though news coverage of it did. During World War I, Spain was a neutral country with a free media that covered the outbreak from the start, first reporting on it in Madrid in late May of 1918. Meanwhile, Allied countries and the Central Powers had wartime censors who covered up news of the flu to keep morale high. Because Spanish news sources were the only ones reporting on the flu, many believed it originated there.”Another excerpt: What Caused the Spanish Flu?It’s unknown exactly where the particular strain of influenza that caused the pandemic came from; however, the 1918 flu was first observed in Europe, America and areas of Asia before spreading to almost every other part of the planet within a matter of months.Despite the fact that the 1918 flu wasn’t isolated to one place, it became known around the world as the Spanish flu, as Spain was hit hard by the disease and was not subject to the wartime news blackouts that affected other European countries. (Even Spain's king, Alfonso XIII, reportedly contracted the flu.)“Edited: 8:18 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"Here is a link for you who don't want to google:https:/…why-was-it-called-the-spanish-fluPS - maybe people will ultimately refer to this as the ""US flu""."
"“Spanish Flu it was credited for helping to end WW1.”It was rather the other way around. But hey! Historical accuracy and nomenclature aside, I hear Tom Barefoot is out of business.~ Colleen"
"As Trump’s lawyer, Bill Barr, said yesterday, “ The winners will write history.” I guess that means it doesn’t really matter what the bleep the truth is."
"Wow......reading this thread makes me wish I had gone ahead and met Sunny for mai tais today. I def feel like I need something strong now! Tom Barefoot is only one business that will close, whether Maui, Hawaii, or anywhere else in the world. We could debate the whys and hows--but TB4's excellent message was to give people a heads up to contest their credit card charges!!!! PS--doing some picky cleaning after a long work week and clearing AC pipes was good fun compared to snipe attacks!Edited: 9:28 pm, May 09, 2020 "
Apologies for taking this thread completely off track.
"I just got done mowing the lawn, pruning my roses and washing my truck or was it prune roses, wash truck then mow lawn. Colleen can you give me a little help with what order I did my chores."
"Reau, you have nothing to apologize for, but that's kind of you. Everyone does a share ""off-messaging"" on the TA forums, now more than ever. So it goes. ~ Colleen"
"Reau, you def don't need to apologize!!!! You didn't start the insanity.......or keep it going, either."
"I liked Tom's Barefoot. Always had the best prices. Customer service excellent. He did not charge your card until the day of your booked trip. Asked a no pressure question if interested in viewing properties.Are people being PC offended over ""Barefoot""? Names aren't usually controversial except to the insecure and some 12 year olds."
"“'The winners will write history.' I guess that means it doesn’t really matter what the bleep the truth is.""Has that ever not been the case, regardless of the ""truth""? But perhaps the difference these days is that there are no winners; but there are a lot of writers, all claiming to be ""journalists"", but few, if any of whom have a legitimate claim to the ""truth""."
"Insanity is everywhere these days, especially on the internet!!"
