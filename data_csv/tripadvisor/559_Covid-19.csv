"Life is normal so far. Only schools closed and apx. 20 infected (14.03.2020). Not like here in Denmark. But they expect changes soon.We had also travel to Riga 12th April but cancelled as we cant travel out of Copenhagen.Edited: 12:09 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Latvia will close their borders from the 17th March
There will be no flights anymore. Make sure you get all your money back. Insist on your rights to get full refund.
I am supposed to be travelling over on 17th April. Not holding my breath though as I feel they may extend the border restrictions.
"My hotel booking is via expedia, in this case when boarders are closed, should I have right to get a refund although the booking was the cheapest with no changes or cancellation allowed."
"Yes, you should get a refund because this is a force majeure situation. Please contact the Expedia, they have a special contact form for it: https:/…travel-alert-refunds"
Thanks!But I can not use that form because my booking starts next thursday . Getting in contact with them is a pain almost impossible with the Finnish customerservice number. Also tried to change dates directly with the hotel. They answered but still waiting for the right person to answer.
"I also have the same question about Riga? Original trip was supposed to be first week of June but now looking to reschedule, any idea when things might open up again?"
"Not yet decided.Its like weather forecast, you really dont know before the day."
"Baltic states to open borders on 15th May for their citizens. https:/…idINS3N28800OEdited: 3:10 am, May 10, 2020 "
"Yes, but in first hand its only baltic citizens who are allowed to travel and only between the 3 baltic countries."
"Lux Express restarts international departures in the Baltics from 22nd of May and initially they are opening 3 bus routes: Tallinn-Riga-Tallinn, Riga-Vilnius-Riga and Tallinn-Vilnius-Tallinn. More info here: https:/… airBaltic will restart flights from Riga to Helsinki and Munich on 25 May. From 1 June onwards, however, the airline will restart flights from Riga to Berlin, More info here: https://bnn-news.com/airbaltic-restarts-flig…Edited: 6:40 am, May 21, 2020 "
"Any word on when tourists from other EU countries might be allowed into Latvia again?We have a trip planned for mid-July and we were already sure that we'll have to cancel, but with so many other EU countries opening up again we have become hopeful again that our trip might happen after all."
Not yet.But I will keep posted when news - we have also booked our trip in mid July.
"Legally you are allowed to travel to Latvia today or tomorrow if you wish or must, it is open. Problem is that you have to stay in self isolation for 14 days if you have been outside the Baltic states for the last 14 days. When they would lift that depends on how bad the situation is in other countries. They may start lifting isolation rules with countries which are doing better and have some white listed and red listed countries. Germany looks like in between, not as bad as France or Spain, or UK, but not quite ok either, so nobody knows. In Latvia they take decisions every 2 weeks, meaning, that if they opened up the Baltic travel, they wait 2 weeks to proceed to the next step (if all goes well). Next decision on lifting some restrictions is expected at the beginning of June, the mid June, then mid July, but your travel and holiday depends mostly on situation in Germany. Right now Germany does not look like being in the first wave of countries with whom travel restrictions are likely to be lifted."
"According to our foreign office, German citizens can only enter Latvia if they are a permanent resident in one of the three Baltic states. If they are not, then they are denied entry, even if they would be willing to go into quarantine for 14 days. Quarantine only applies to residents/citizens of Latvia who enter Latvia after not having spent the previous 14 days in Latvia, Estonia or Lithuania exclusively.In any case, thank you for the information. I'll follow the developments to see what countries Latvia opens up to in the coming weeks.In relative numbers though, Latvia and Germany now have similar case numbers. If you calculate new cases per 100.000 inhabitants in the last 7 days, Latvia is at 3.2 cases, Germany at 4.6, UK at 29, Iceland at 0.5).Edited: 3:57 am, May 24, 2020 "
"Your source is no longer correct, any EU citizen can travel to Latvia now: https:/…Portal https://eng.lsm.lv/ is a reliable source. You can also follow Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs on twitter (or if you are not using it at least read his tweets)."
"I stand corrected. Thank you for the link, I will start following any updates.In any case, I find it curious that AirBaltic is in the process of resuming international flights, and of the 9 non-Baltic destinations that have been announced so far, 5 are in Germany -- some of these flights even operate daily. I wonder who will be booking these flights with the self-isolation rule still in place. Maybe AirBaltic knows something that we don't? (this is my hope speaking, of course)"
"Most of the people who will book the first flights will be Latvians eager to finally see their families, parents or simply to spend summer in their cottages. There are many of us, Latvians, around the world eagerly waiting to go even if that means 14 day self isolation. And there is equally anxious Latvian government which does not really know how many of us are abroad and what it would mean if we all suddenly wanted to go and visit our loved ones back home. I think they are not dreading tourists like you who will be staying in hotels or rental appartements, I am afraid they are dreading us - the large expat community who may suddenly rise to feet and decide to go back home, many from places hit hard by covid like France or UK. And THAT they don't want or at least want to drag in time as much as they can.Anyway, follow the sources I mentioned, and lets hope you can have your hols in LV. Believe me, Latvians want tourists, they need you guys going to the Baltic shore and to the small towns and villages, to stay in hotels or guest houses, to eat in local cafes. But you must be aware that there will be no festivals and no big parties this summer. Just beach, forest, market, only individual visitors or small groups in museums.Edited: 1:38 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"In my feel Latvian government don't want tourists. Kovi hysteria hit the government hardly and they continue in it.Contrary to what I have seen, as example, in Croatian government latest attitude toward tourism, Latvian show complete indifference.Because Latvian government and Latvian people live in two different worlds, which rarely meet.I don't say that Latvian people don't want tourists. We want!Edited: 4:51 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"And question to whom I can't find answer - why law's by fines forced 14.day home quarantine is called self isolation, which implies voluntariness???"
"@Ezsme_II: Beach, forest, small towns and individual travel is exactly why we're (hopefully) coming to Latvia. Keeping our fingers crossed!@Kurlander: I assume they say ""self-isolation"" and not ""quarantine"" because travelers will not be held in a central quarantine location (e.g. a government hospital or a designated airport hotel) but have to arrange isolation for themselves at home. This does not mean that it is voluntary or optional."
Quarantine means quarantine both in home or in some other location.
It's just nuance..
"Now Estonia and Lithuania has opened their borders for turists from some “safe” EU-countries, so they can visit without 14 days self isolation. Latvia has still not opened their borders.But with open borders in the 2 other Baltic states it makes no meaning to keep Latvia closed, as there are free travel between all the 3 Baltic states.I will update again when news about Latvia.Edited: 4:20 am, June 02, 2020 "
"Latvia now opened their borders as well! Travelers coming from EU/EEA/Switzerland can enter the country without the need to self-isolate if the number of new Corona infections per 100.000 in the last 14 days lies below 15 in the country of origin. If it is between 15,1 and 25 you need to self-isolate for 14 days. If it is above 25 then you may not enter and direct flights are cancelled. Estonia and Lithuania seem to adapt the same rule.Each Friday a list of countries meeting the criteria will be published. This list will be valid in the week (Mon thru Sun) following that Friday. As of last Friday, you don't need to Self-Isolate if you're coming from Denmark, Germany or Luxemburg.This information comes from the Twitter account of Latvia's Foreign Minister, but I'm sure it will be made official on multiple websites soon.https:/…https:/…Edited: 10:56 am, June 02, 2020 "
"What a discrimination of Montenegro, where today isn't problem with Kovi at all?)"
"Also Iceland, Mauritius and New Zealand are practically COVID-19 free by now. But I guess you have to start somewhere."
"Thanks @Malterno for the update. Lets hope all get on the list soon and stay there.@Kurlander We are all victims of this virus, why pick on positive progress. Dont look for half empty glass, when it is half filled.Please all take care when you are travelling and keep the distances. For the safety of us all."
"We are thinking of a 2-week Baltics trip in the very near future (could be in 2-3 weeks). Any experiences with border crossings between the 3 countries? We would fly to Vilnius and leave from Tallinn.I think Estonia still conducts checks at the border with Latvia, correct? Are they being difficult at border posts?"
"@PP AmsFunny question. Difficult at border? You are affraid they will check passport and car?Borders are like every border inside EU.Please make new topic with new questions in forum, if they are not already answered, to make it more easy for other people to find and to avoid mixing topics."
"I travelled from Tallinn to Riga yesterday by Lux Express, no border checks."
"@EastwoodDK: it's good to think about the possible reasons behind my question, before criticizing. Up until recently there were controls at the border with Estonia due to the COVID situation:https:/…@thirstytraveller2016: thanks for the information."
@PP AmsSure and I did.But until recently you couldnt travel in the Baltic countries as a turist.
"As of today, you have to self-isolate for 14 days after entering Latvia, if you come from Sweden, UK, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland. Newest info here: https:/…"
"There is a blanket travel ban from non-EU countries to EU countries + Switzerland, Iceland, Lichtenstein until July 1. BUT if you are citizen of Latvia, you can return, Latvian Constitutions guarantees you the right to return home from wherever you are, but you must self-isolate for 2 weeks if you come from non-EU. I know that this may be unfair towards some smaller countries with covid under control, but apparently this is only diplomatically acceptable solution (as we can imagine various countries with various tourist profiles may wish to lift travel bans to countries where covid is still problem, but where most of their tourists come from (an example that comes to my mind is BG and RU). Thus the political solution is blanket ban for all non-EU to all EU.Edited: 11:05 am, June 06, 2020 "
"I don't speak Latvian, but I was under the impression that if you're coming from a country with a higher rate than 25 new cases in 14 days per 100.000 inhabitants (marked red in the table) you are completely banned from entering Latvia. If you're coming from a country with 15 to 25 cases (marked yellow) you are allowed to enter but must self-isolate for 14 days, and if your country of origin has less than 15 cases (marked white) you can enter without self-isolation.So for the coming week, you cannot enter the country if you're coming from Sweden, UK, Portugal or any country not part of EU/EEA/Switzerland. And you need to self-isolate if you're coming from Ireland or Belgium. Everybody else can enter freely.Edited: 11:26 am, June 06, 2020 "
"By the way -- Estonia has the exact same immigration criteria. However, the list of countries that they update each Friday is valid for the coming calender week. I.e., the list posted yesterday (June 5th) applies to people entering Estonia from Monday (June 8th) thru Sunday (June 14th). Today and tomorrow the list from last week (May 29th) still applies.Can anyone confirm if Latvia applies the same rule, or are all country list valid immediately after they are published?"
"All turists from EU countries with infectionscases below 15 can now visit Latvia without self isolation.Edited: 2:49 am, June 07, 2020 "
"Hi guys,My wife and I are from Montenegro (corona free) and plan to travel this summer around eastern europe.We plan to fly in to Riga on 18th of June (did not buy tickets yet) with Baltic Air, from Croatia, there are direct flighta from Dubrovnik. Selling now at around 100 euro one way.Basically we want to visit Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus ,Ukraine, Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria. I know, it is a hell of a plan :)As I understand now, Montenegro is currently not on the list for travel to EU, even though we do not have any active cases now.EU mentioned these days that by June 15th all EU members should provide open borders and terminate isolation rules. But still I do not see any official press release in this regard... Am I missing some info or we still will not be able to travel to EU from June 15th?Thank you,Predrag"
"Hi Predrag,that sounds like an amazing journey. However, even though it's impossible to say for certain, your plan does not sound feasible to me given the current situation. As of today, it's not even clear if there will be a EU-wide policy regarding immigration from third countries from 15 June (less likely), or if every EU country will create its own rules as to who may enter and who may not (more likely).I have read that Germany considers implementing a rule which allows quarantine-free entry from Non-EU countries where the rate of new infections lies below 50 per 100.000 inhabitants in 7 days. If all EU countries apply this rule, then your entry from Montenegro will work. But this is not set in stone yet, and nobody will be able to tell you today if Latvia will also apply these rules of entry from June 15th.Whereas the Non-EU countries on your itinerary are concerned -- Belarus does not take Corona very seriously, you might be fine there (but please check!). Ukraine however does not allow any Non-Ukrainians to enter at the moment and without a crystal ball it's impossible to say if this is still in place when you plan to enter.Also, beware of the fact that when you enter any given country, it will not only matter how low corona numbers are back home in Montenegro, but also what the situation is in countries that you have already passed through on your journey. Entering the EU (Romania) for a second time after spending time in Belarus (high corona numbers!) and Ukraine might not work.Bottom line: If you do want to go on this journey you'll have to be very flexible and adapt your itinerary as you go. Wait until after June 15th to book your flight. Don't book any flights or train tickets where you won't get a refund if the destination country will not let you in. Be prepared to skip a country or two (or go somewhere else instead) if going there is not feasible. Maybe change your itinerary so that you have to enter the EU only once at the beginning of your trip and then go to Belarus and Ukraine afterwards, if you can.Good luck!"
"@PredragAs Malterno mention its not even clear that EU citizens will be able to visit all EU countries from 15th.As it look now Denmark will not open its borders for more countries the first weeks after opening for Germany, Norway and Island only on the 15th. After that we will monitor the virus in some weeks before decide opening for more EU-countries.So I dont think EU can agree on any common rules this summer."
"Mr.Predrag, it's nice that you are interested to visit my country.:)Have been in yours two times. As people already mentioned, our bureaucrats are full of uncertainty what to do after when Kovi showed itself as almost nothing in our country.They continue playing very serious attitude (received recently invitation from gov-ment to download app with Kovi patients, which I , of course, deleted) and enjoy power, which they don't have previously. If their attitude will ruin your travel plans, I can only apologise. Already mentioned that prohibition (so far) for Montenegrians to visit Latvia is unfair. Hope, that those things will change in short time.Edited: 3:11 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"@Malterno,Thanks for the detailed reply.I am literally checking every day the news, and expect some encouraging developmwnt of the situation... Unfortunately still no good news for the citizens of Montenegro yet.I hope by end of the week there will be EU agreemwnt about border opening, as they mentioned they will include Western Balkan countries in their deal for border reopening.I understand not all EU the states agree with this, and it is not legally binding. I think Spain and UK will not be part of this, but let's see for the rest...We are flexible with our itinerary, but we pretty much covered all the western europe, which is why we want to do the eastern part now...Let's see how this week go...Thanks,PredragEdited: 7:36 am, June 08, 2020 "
"@Kurlander,We really want to visit the Baltic states at least, to drive around, so let's see how this week develops...We cannot not travel this summer :)We were backpacking latin america and were forced to come back home beginning of april, so we need to do some more traveling, at least around europe, since latin america is now in the middle of this sh*t. :/Predrag"
"@Predrag TI hope this works out for you. Let us know how it goes. If you want to increase your chances, is there any possibility of traveling a month or two later? In August the rules might be a little clearer."
"@Malterno,We are in between jobs right now, which is why we want to use this time to travel, and not delay it further.Obviously, should the politics not allow it, there is no much to do about it.Anyhow, let's see how the situation develops this and next week..."
"Today I read in a German newspaper article that the EU is leaning towards opening borders between EU/EEA states on Monday but that they will keep external EU borders closed for another two weeks. They would then assess the situation on a country-by-country basis, with Western Balkan states mentioned specifically as being likely candidates to be included in the first wave of opening borders.But as far as I understand, these are only EU recommendations while in practice every country can decide for itself who can enter and who cannot. For instance, Iceland (that is not in EU but in EEA) basically lets in anyone -- even Americans -- provided they either let themselves get tested for COVID-19 on arrival or else go into self-isolation for 14 days. At least that's what I understood.It's a big mess. Every country plays by its own rules which change frequently.Edited: 7:42 am, June 12, 2020 "
@MalternoCorrect.Every EU-member state can and will do their own rules. Just as now.And backstep is increase in Poland and Norway this week after opening.I hope most EU countries will follow the Baltic model and use the weekly infection rate to decide from which countries you can visit or not.Lets see. The next 2 weeks before summer holidays will be interesting to follow.
"Hi guys,I read the same that @malterno mentioned.Greece is the only EU state opening for Montenegro citizens now from June 15th, so we are going to start from there until end of month, and then wait for definite confirmation for other EU countries from July 1st.Than we can basically continue our trip north and follow where we can go.Let's see how the situation develops, hopefully things will look good from July. I see that Finland already said that it will not be open for non EU states until at least July 15th."
