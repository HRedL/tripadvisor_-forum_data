"I'm going on a business trip via HK to SFO later this week. I received a travel advisory from my company informing me that there is a ""high risk"" of H1N1 in Hong Kong. I'd like to get some neutral opinions from other people regarding the real threat/risk. I have 10 hours to spend in HK and I was hoping to do some local sightseeing but with this threat, I'm not only reconsidering the sightseeing but getting my ticket rerouted completely!Should I wear one of those protective masks with me at the airport?Any thoughts/opinions would be welcome."
No particular concerns at this time for avian flu. I wouldn't worry about anything.
"I don't think about it. If it's a real epidemic, it would have been all over the news already."
"It is still normal here, but some common practise will apply. for example, wash your hand thoroughly before meals or arrived home/hotel, or with contact on your eyes and noses."
No high risk.Having your taxi crash and kill you on the way to the airport in India is probably far higher than even getting near a chicken with H1N1 in Hong Kong (let alone getting infected) and that taxi ride also doesn't stop you from traveling. IAt the moment it's very much a non-issue here. Other than the continuing import ban of live mainland chickens because of the H1N1 risk at the other side of the border... which only confirms that Hong Kong is pretty much H1N1-free.
