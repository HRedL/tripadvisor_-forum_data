They received 41 demerits in a health inspection on Sep 25 and were closed. …eater.com/archives/2012/09/27/snhd-shuts-do…One of my favorites! :(
I ate at Morels a few years ago when it was relatively new. Found a hair on my plate. Guess my misfortune was not an isolated event.
There has got to be a Morel To That Story... :)
"I wouldn't worry too much - they'll clean up, re-inspect and be open again - probably this weekend."
Please go watch contagion. One person caused an epidemic across the world simply because he didn't wash his hands.
"shut down, not CLOSED!Happens often. If you read the article it's not the only restaurant that week, why not mention the other?Dining out is chancy, one reason I avoid buffets - ever watch all the nasty habits by the patrons? Eating tidbits in line, touching their mouths and then handling serving pieces. Gross."
boo
Losvu is right - if you ever saw a commercial kitchen you might never eat again. The inspections are tough and designed to cut problems off before they occur. Most home kitchens wouldn't pass either.
"PhillyWill, that's what I was thinking too but not sure if I would go back after hearing all the infractions! :( Raphusparker, saw it. Yes, it can happen ANYWHERE!! But not likely. Losvu, I didn't mention the other restaurants in the story becuase I was only concerned with Morels. I started the thread and I will mention what I please, thank you. That is also why I inserted the link. Snidely, that's gross!"
