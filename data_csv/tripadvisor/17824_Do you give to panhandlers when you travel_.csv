"Any differently than at home? For some reason, I'm a magnet and get panhandled everywhere I go. I only give once in a while, usually to a silent beggar, just sitting there with a sign."
Yes. Both at home and when traveling. Not to every single person. But frequently.
Yes. Both at home and while traveling.
"Not as a rule but then I do not do so when at home except through charity boxesHowever, when on holiday if a musician is providing entertainment for others on a street corner I will drop a few coins in to the hatWhen in gran Canaria a couple of years ago we passed a down and out asleep on the pathway, when we returned he was beggingNext day he was not there as I had said to Mrs A that should he be there as we were going to the shop I would buy him a sandwich. On our return we followed him along to his place of begging and he was checking his I phone which he then hid under his blanket.No way was he getting anything when he has a better phone than me and Mrs A"
"No - not locally, and not in my travels.Hunt"
"Yes, when we are in a different country, and I see a forlorn figure sitting on the church steps, (not begging, just sitting), I will always give them the equivalent of 3-5 dollars. Never give to anyone panhandling, and following us around aggressively. At home, sometimes. Depends. Some are really poor, and could use some money, and I have no issue at all if they spend it on a drink. Did get a lecture from a friend about being an enabler by giving them money, but, so what, if they buy themselves a beer? However, it’s hard to tell. Like Ashtonian, I, also, have seen fancy iPhones, and fancy gold chains."
"Not usually, I did give to one here, that was sitting there with his dog, gave money, but thought about it and went in and bought water and food for the dog. My last time at home, one was sitting outside the grocery store, I would say he was in his 20's. On the way out he was asking for change, my turn, he asked me, I said, I don't have any, he said I could go to the bank machine...I said, no. He said F you....I said back at you...we both laughed at that...he didn't get anything from me. Different story, when I got home...husband wasn't too happy, called the store and mentioned customers shouldn't be harassed outside the store.Edited: 1:32 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"I do not give to aggressive people.Also here in Seattle we have homeless who are organized and selling the Real Change newspaper, so that's not really ""panhandling"" to me. They have to buy the papers they sell (like 35 cents and they sell for $2). I usually give them $2 and don't take a paper.I always give to street musicians, but again, I don't consider busking the same as panhandling."
"BTW, those here that work the intersections are dropped off, it's like a business."
I don't give to the freeway ramp people either. And yes they do work shifts at the popular spots.
Very rarely at home or when travelling
"Yes, I do when I travel, mostly to handicapped people, elderly, women or kids. I know that giving money to panhandlers might encourage them to stay on that path, especially kids, however it is hard to just walk by and ignore them. But I don't give to the ones who follow me around. ""those here that work the intersections are dropped off, it's like a business."" There are more and more of these in my area too."
"Me, no; my husband, yes. We haven't traveled outside the US/Canada, if that matters.I see panhandlers as salesmen (and they are nearly all men) - their product is making me feel good about myself.I'm involved with an all-volunteer group that provides food/clothing/rent/utilities/car repair/transportation for those in need. If I see someone with a sign requesting $, I'll give them a business card with a phone number. I'll also give them a few dollars since they have to listen to my spiel about the organization :-)Trek, if you don't want to be a magnet, do not make eye contact."
"Buskers yes, beggars, no, unless I’m traveling and need to ditch 1/2 a kilo’s weight in € or £ coins in my pocket."
"Yes, at home and abroad, but It depends on the situation, and I do not do so frequently. For example, I gave nothing to panhandlers in Vietnam, who followed me, demanding money because of what the U.S. did to their country. But I have given food or money in places, such as India or Africa, where the recipients appeared to be authentically needy. When I was last in Turkey, Syrian refugees were panhandling on the street. But I had been warned that many were imposters, taking advantage of the the war. So I made a donation to one of the charitable institutions providing food to the refugees."
"I always feel very guilty not giving but i just don't. When I am at home I carry a quarter for my grocery cart and that is all. I have my debit card for groceries and gas. Besides, the panhandlers around here are here everyday.When I travel I also do not give to panhandlers, I do not want to be marked as easy pickings.I feel badly for people who have to resort to this and I do give to charities and food banks."
"When we travel to Cuba, there are many there asking for items, or have their own little scams, there are no homeless in Cuba. We know it's our fault from many years of gifting, just handing things out, it became expected. Now, we are trying to educate others the best thing to do is take your items if you still want to help, donate to a church, senior facility, or a charitable organization, and they will distribute where needed."
"IlliniTrav #12,On a different question, than the one asked, we have 3 favorite charities, out of about 20, which address issues of the homeless, and similar.One provides clothing, housing, and training, primarily to women, to help restart their lives: Fresh StartAnother does similar, with new wardrobes for women entering the job market, due to an issue in their lives: Florence CrittendenAnother, is a bit more broad range, and does housing and food for families: Circle the City.They receive annual contributions, and my wife sat on the boards for two.All are listed in our trust, along with over a dozen other charities.Around the holidays, we contribute to two adopt-a-family programs: one at my wife’s largest hospital (primarily for their lower-wage workers), and then another, through her church. Also, for the latter, we give weekly to a continuing program for helping families in the Parish.So, the answer, to a different question is - Yes.Hunt"
HuntYou and your good lady will get your reward in heaven.Maybe you will get asked to be in charge of the wine
"To me there is a big difference between musicians and street performers, people sitting quietly with a hat out, someone who just looks like they could use some help that day, anyone who asks me politely for money - for me those are all ""yes"" for giving. The freeway ramp gang, anyone who physically or verbally gets in my face, people who say anything nasty - those are a ""no"".The other way I differ from many people is I don't care what they choose to do with the money. None of my business."
"Hunt, I think most of us help out other organizations throughout the year...the question was giving to others that are on the street."
"I don't. Especially in a tourist area. While I feel for the people, when it is elderly or handicapped people, someone brought them from their home to the tourist area. Those people should be protected, not used for profiting, from their handicap. Occasionally I have given food but sometimes it hasn't been accepted which even more emphasizes that there may not be a need.On the other hand, and I know this is controversial, I will occasionally buy from child vendors if I know it is not a time they should be in school. If a child should be in school I will not buy from them as that encourages parents to keep them out of school. I have friends in a developing country and they tell me that without the kids contributing to the family's income, in many cases they would not eat. I also support an education program in that same country so that kids will have the opportunity to break that cycle of poverty.Edited: 4:05 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Well yes I also donate to charitable organizations. To me that is a separate topic from the question asked in the title of this thread.In my own city I know pretty much what's what, so am comfortable giving. I am more selective when I travel because I realize I may not understand what exactly is going on behind the scenes (when elderly women, babies, kids are brought into a tourist area to beg, for example, as mentioned above)."
"Generally not, especially in touristy areas, and never to an aggressive beggar. I am more inclined to give to a busker, not a beggar. In Acapulco we would throw money off the pier and the kids would dive in to get it, it seems they were in training to be cliff divers. Just pick up a harmonica and I will be more inclined to give.Sometimes I give food, if someone seems in real need. I prefer to give to charity, or do my own charity work at home. My wife and I donate school supplies every year, and do school feedings when we can."
"Now, for buskers, we do very often drop a $5 in their jar, if we have enjoyed their performance.Same for music in a restaurant/bar, and more, if my wife has requested any song - but I see such, as different, than the OP.Hunt"
"For me, it depends on the situation to such a degree that it's hard to describe succinctly. But I will try to make it transactional - maybe asking someone for directions, or something like that. I think it's nice for both parties if I'm paying for a service. ----suze2you @7 - you mention ""Real Change"". In Australia and the UK, The Big Issue follows a similar model. I do like to buy it, usually from people I recognise and like. But again, it's making it transactional, and I like that. NYU62 @5 - -----------I have no issue at all if they spend it on a drink.-------------When I was at university in Leeds, there was a path from university down to the city centre. Drunks would stagger up and say ""Have you got 50p (pence) for a cup of tea?"" Obviously they were going to spend it on beer. As a skint student, I would sometimes help and sometimes wouldn't. But one came up and said, ""Have you got 50p that I could put towards a can of Special Brew (Carlsberg's 8.5% beer)?"" I laughed and happily paid him."
"@suze2you and @LoriM -You both mention ""ramp gangs"" or ""intersection gangs"". What are these? I've never heard of this sort of thing."
Ariel-Scarlett @28 -It's good to know they're getting so international. It's a really good idea.
"Bruceramp/intersection gangsThey may be referring to groups who when you get to a busy road junction in queueing traffic leap in front of you wanting to clean your windscreen.We used to have them in Manchester, often either Romanians or asylum seekers problem was some would get aggressive when you politely said no thank you and due to traffic you could not drive away from them"
"Ah, right. Our windscreen-washer people are all very friendly and jolly, and not pushy at all. A brief shake of the head is all it takes to get them to not wash your windscreen. There's one nice, rather batty, old man who wears a selection of mad hats and washes windscreens at an intersection on my way home from my elder daughter's school. Cromansydney2 will know who he is, I suspect: everyone around here does. I give him money when I get the chance. Actually, I once called the police about him when he hadn't been at the intersection for a few days, as I was worried about him - he's pretty old and frail. They knew where he usually slept, and went to check on him. I'm not sure what happened, but he's back now, and he's fine."
This isn’t exactly on topic but I thought a pan handler was someone who panned for gold and not a beggar.Jackie
"HiVery rarely indeedI do know once when we were in the Gambia we felt really sorry for some young boys who had missing limbs with one of them being in a wheelchair and when we had seen them around we had given them some moneyOne day when we were going on a trip our guide came to collect us at our hotel and we all piled into the back of an open top vehicle and when we drove by the young lads we went to throw them some money and the guide stopped us. When we asked why he simple said ""they were not born that way, their family made them more appealing beggars"". He said such mutilation was not uncommon in some poor countriesHorrible!!!"
"""He said such mutilation was not uncommon in some poor countries""Not unheard of in Europe either."
"Bruce,The ""intersection gangs"" in my area are panhandlers that are dropped off at intersections then picked up later. It looks like a well organized business, that rotates these people from one intersection to another. Each one of them has a backpack, most likely to carry some snacks and water. They all have a sign stating their condition (lost job, homelessness, single parent...), and in these Covid times, they now wear mask and gloves!It might be different in other areas, but this is what happens in Northern Virginia.And btw, they don't bother to wash windshields anymore! Their business model has changed!Edited: 11:49 am, June 19, 2020 "
"#29 for Bruce - There are people here in Seattle who sit around freeway ramp exits with a cardboard sign asking for money (""will work for food"", ""disabled veteran"", etc.). I used the word ""gang"" only because as someone else mentioned already, they appear organized with the same people working the same times each day at specific locations. I observe a 6 o'clock shift change between two regulars at a ramp I use frequently right at that time."

"A good friend of mine used to take BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit————similar to a subway system) to work daily in Northern California. Each day, after her ride home, she would see a woman, and her 3 small children, dressed in rags, sitting inside the station, with a sign “Need money for food”. Rare was the passerby who would not toss money into her basket. My friend would give her $5 daily. This went on for months.One day, my friend lingered by the magazine stand, and saw this man walk over to her. The woman handed him all the bills, he counted them, put the money in his pocket, and left. What drew her attention was that he was very sharply dressed, Armani shoes (her description), 3-piece suit, fancy tie and sunglasses. The children did not acknowledge him, so she doubted that he was their father.Anyway, she watched and waited to see him again, as her curiosity was aroused. A few weeks later, she saw him. Different fancy clothes, but same procedure. He waited until there were no people around, and my friend hid behind a column. This time, when he counted the bills, he was not happy. He grabbed her arm, went through her pockets, and then, gave her a strong smack on the face.My friend called the police, but domestic violence is not a priority, and, by the time they arrived, everybody was gone. She continued giving this woman money, as she felt that she had to, as, otherwise, she might get beaten. After several weeks, they no longer came to that station, and she wondered what had become of them."
nyu62Seems to me the guy was a pimp.Just a pimp with a different racket
