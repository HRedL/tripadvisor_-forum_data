"Just seen this on The Orlando Sentinal website.Florida's move-over law begins Monday. The move-over law, requires drivers to give a wide berth to police or emergency vehicles, on roads with multiple lanes, drivers need to move out of the lane closest to any emergency or law-enforcement vehicle, if it is safe to do so. If a motorist is unable to move over, or on two-lane roads, drivers must reduce their speed to at least 20 mph less than the posted speed limit or to 5 mph if the posted speed limit is 20 mph, according to the law."
I actually thought this already was law. I think it is in my state (MD).I even do it here in Britain (although i have no idea if it is law though- is it)?
"Yes i think it has been law for years, but appears that they are as of Monday going to start enforcing it, most counties are going to give warnings to start, others are giving tickets as of Monday."
Sounds like common sense to me......
Perhaps everyone used to move over but now are wearing Ipods and can't hear? 
It would seem like it should be common sense but after 13 years as an Officer I've learned that it's not. I hate having to work an accident on the freeway...the cars going screaming by without slowing down just inches away from me....very scary!!!!!
"Then I would say those folks who don't move over..... have no common sense.......... Common sense would tell one to slow down and move over if possible. I did it long before it was a law. Sadly, I still see drivers who don't. I would say they............. have no common sense.................. "
"Agreed, lack of common sense is an epidemic in this country...."
"I hope it works better for them than the law they just brought in about cars and other vehicles signalling when the intend to change lanes/ direction. And the one that will give you a $185 fine for not stopping on orange and running red lights, and exceeding the speed limit often by 20 mph +. Cos on my last visit a few weeks ago few had got those messages.And the law seemed unconcerned with enforcing them.Or it it just another the police will use their discretion on."
i have to agree i always pull over just common sense
That has always been like that and that's in every state in US.
"XR759 - good points.Next time you are out driving in the U.S., count the number of vehicles you see that have at least one brake light out (most vehicles have at least four brake bulbs in three brake lights, left, center high mounted, and right). Or how many newer vehicles have one or both front daytime running lights burnt out. I would guess most people don't even realize their daytime running lights aren't working, I think you have to have the engine running and possibly in gear for them to be on."
This is so important. A small community near my hometown had a tragedy recently. There was an accident on an elevated highway and several officers had stopped to help while waiting for emergency vehicles for those in the wreck. A car passing the accident a a high rate of speed caught the bumper of one of the police cars and a 24 year old officer was crushed between the car and the wall of the highway and killed. Such a senseless tragedy! This law should be enforced to the fullest extent.
"Sounds like a very good idea to me, although I would have thought it was common sense to slow down and give a wide berth. Indicating when changing lanes is interesting though - in the main, we do that in the UK without thinking if there is other traffic close by. Weaving in and out of lanes without signalling is definitely something we've found very common in the US."
"I totally agree with the premise of the law, it is sad that it must be written as law and not just be common courtesy. My big concern, however, is that it is usually the driver who never saw the emergency vehicle that hits that emergency vehicle. So, if the offending driver, for whatever reason, never realizes the emergency vehicle is there, what good is having a move over law going to do? If you have a driver who is impaired past the point of realizing a vehicle is stopped on the side of the road, no law written is going to make him aware of said stopped vehicle. I'm not saying the law is wrong, I just worry that officers may become falsely confident in the law and expose themselves to the ever present danger. As for the rest of us who it appears showed courtesy prior to this becoming a law, we already saw emergency vehicles and wasn't much of a hazard of running over that vehicle or it's driver. I think we always moved over just to help make the situation more comfortable for those stopped. I also would like to have seen the law written to protect ALL stopped vehicles, not just law enforcement & construction workers as it is here in Tennessee. Every motorist who is stopped on the side of the road deserves the same courtesy and safety imposed by this law. Well, my soap box is creaking, so I'll get down now. "
"A AAA (American Automobile Association) tow truck driver, who was called by the member for help, was struck and killed on the highway last month by a driver as he was trying to help the AAA member."
"Lots of good points in this thread. I have always wondered why drivers ed and the license bureau manuals don't stress that if you are pulled over by a LEO, make sure you turn off of the main road onto a side road or at least move as far off of the main roadway as possible to allow the LEO and the vehicle driver to be as far away from moving traffic as possible.Again, this seems like it would be common sense, but I have often seen LEOs practically standing in the roadway dealing with drivers they have pulled over."
"I just got stopped today in Mississippi about this. Personally, I had never heard of this law. I saw the officer as he was getting back into his car after giving someone a ticket. I was aware of him, I had slowed down, just wasn't aware I was supposed to change lanes as well. He came and pulled me over. I told him honestly that I had never heard of this before. I agree with the concept, but if a person has done all the other things, the changing lanes should not be necessary.  Also, at home we see crawlers across our TV screen many times a day reminding people of the digital signal change for TV coming in 2009. Every day! Wouldn't something like the move over law be important enough to use this method to educate the public? I saw another site that said over 71% of Americans have never even heard of this law, and the ticket in Mississippi would have been $275!! Now, I understand ignorance is not a defense regarding a violation, but lack of effort on the government's part to inform us adequately should be. What am I supposed to do in the future, read the transcript of every bill passed into law by the state legislature? I think last regular session they introduced about 3000 bills. I don't know about you, but I dont have that much spare time. "
Is this just when the emergency vehicle is using blues and twos or does it mean at all times?As a UK police driver a lot of drivers will not realise you are behind them even with lights and siren blasting for some time!
Does your car have to pass a M.O.T. inspection if over three years old?
UkCopOutThis is when an emergency vehicle is on the side of the road dealing with an incident.
"Oh right thanks, was a bit confused."
"No, Mick, no MOT here -- if it rolls, it's allowed on the highway. The FHP have been out IN FORCE of late -- so make sure you mind the posted speed limits, by the way. Most of the officers I've seen conducting a stop this week have gone round to the passenger side to conduct the procedures -- probably out of self-preservation!(How anyone can miss a 12-foot high vehicle with reflective tape and high-visibility strobe lights in the case of an ambulance -- or miss the high-vis blue strobes carried by every LEO in Florida that can be seen for miles -- absolutely beggars belief...if you don't see THOSE, you have no business being on the highway.)"
Common sense should prevail.
I am confused on how they might enforce this. I will give you a scenario: a cop car is racing up behind me (going somewhere urgently) and I ignorantly do not comply (perhaps I don't know the rules).Will he pull me over and give me a ticket? Or is he in a hurry?
"ChinnersThis relates to passing emergency or law enforcement vehicles, parked at the side of the road that are dealing with an incident, not police cars driving up behind you."
"Chinners, Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for disobeying traffic laws around here, and yes, you would likely be ticketed.Driving is a privilege and with that privilege comes the responsibility of being sure you have knowledge of local traffic laws. Same thing with driving in NYC, just because you may make a right on red in almost every other municipality it doesn't mean it's legal to do so there. It's the driver's responsibility to know that--or not get behind the wheel."
"Personally I believe something like a portable airbag should be developed for the police to have when they get out of their car alongside a highway. There have been far too many accidents around here - especially late at night when it appears that a driver (usually intoxicated) is drawn to the squad car's lights and plows right into it. Often a senseless tragedy results. It's like they are a moth drawn to a light. Unfortunately , the move over law (which is a good law) does not help in this situation."
"of course, if we found a way to idiot-proof law officers, we'd solve an awful lot of things....!"
"My husband is an EMT, and about half of his shifts he is responsible for driving the ambulance.You wouldn't believe how many times ignorant people don't pull over or even slow down.He and I stopped to render assistance to a woman who had been ejected from her car during an accident and was laying on the shoulder of the road dying. People barely slowed down as they whizzed by only a couple of feet from us, and my husband was almost hit several times by idiots who were gawking at the accident scene instead of paying attention while he attempted life saving procedures on this poor woman.The really disgusting part is that people who WITNESSED this accident that happened on a busy interstate during rush hour never even stopped to help her. We came upon it a minute or two later and the only person who had stopped was a very kind man who hadn't witnessed the entire thing but had seen her car rolling in his rear view mirror and had driven back up the median to see if he could help and had called 9-1-1. Just remember when you decide not to pull over to let an emergency vehicle pass or not to slow down while they are rendering assistance on the side of the road--it could be YOUR loved one that dies because of the delay. Karma will get you every time."
"Thank heavens that there are people like your husband -- I will freely admit that I simply could not handle seeing so much trauma, nor thinking about its impact on those still alive (victims and/or their families) after the fact.All I can do is send up prayers to the powers that be, and to move over so they can do their jobs."
