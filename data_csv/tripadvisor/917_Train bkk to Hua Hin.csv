"I plan to travel from bkk to Hua Hin this Friday. This morning went to Hua Lamphong to buy a ticket, but was told I could only buy a ticket on Friday. Is this correct?"
"Assuming that you asked why, what were you told?Edited: 4:41 am, June 09, 2020 "
chances are it was the local train but have no idea what the current service is but booking to Hua Hin was often not possible on line anyway
She could not speak English and I do not speak Thai.
Very very unusual that there was not an English speaker - unless it is closed during the virus there is a special section for foreigners to buy tickets and they always speak good English and many of the normal staff also speak English as well as at the info desk
Your experience is different to mine and I have been there a few times over the years.
"If she couldn't speak English, then how did you know that she told you that ^you could only buy a ticket^ on Friday ?"
"If your budget will stretch, I'd take a taxi if I were you."
Normally there is a train early morning that you can buy tickets in advance for from the office on your left as you walk in the station.During the current time trains weren’t running and are only just resuming. I would think only the third class trains will run and those you would buy on the day of travel.I’m in Hua Hin and asked last weekend about trains to Bangkok and was told they weren’t running at that time. There’s still mini buses running to both Mo Chit and Ekkamai from Hua Hin. Mo Chit service runs from Market Village to Bangkok and Ekkamai service has set up near the bus station near Soi 96.
"Hi,The person who told you must have been referring to the non air conditioned local trains which are running. For these you can buy the ticket on the day only. To the best of my knowledge, the air con trans are not yet operating. You can also travel from Thonburi, service 255 departs at 07.30 and is scheduled to arrive in Hua Hin at 11.44."
"#OzBee I would be very surprised if you were to ask about the subject of buying tickets as hualampong for English speakers you would get many who would agree that it is hard finding English speakers. Sure on occasion you have to be careful and make sure you have the right train, the right date and so on but buying tickets in Thailand for English speakers is simplicity itself at the vast majority of stations and especially at Hualampong I suspect that if they were able to communicate that you needed to come back on Friday and buy the ticket then for the train then it might say more about your communication skills in a foreign country."
"I agree that staff at Hua Lamphong speak little English. My experience there is that unless you write down, in advance, the time and day of the train, you will waste a lot of time getting nowhere. Asking a question is pointless considering how little English staff speak. Which is not good enough considering it is the main railway station. There is no dedicated counter for foreigners, just the same four or five ticket booths that Thais and everybody else line up at."
"Hi,Another one post wonder? I have travelled from Hualamphong many times, OK the staff may not be fluent enough to have a conversation in English but they can certainly hold their own when being asked questions about rail services and selling tickets.Actually, there is a dedicated office for foreigners, it's on the left hand side as you exit the MRT station.Edited: 9:47 am, June 10, 2020 "
"Like much of the Thai public service that deals with farangs, selecting staff that speak English is not a priority at Hua Lamphong. If you need to find out about train times, better to search the Internet than become frustrated dealing with Thai-only speaking counter staff at Hua Lamphong. Hua Lamphong will soon be history anyway when the new station at Bang Sue opens, taking away much of the rail traffic. Pity they do not replace Thai-only speaking staff with a few people that can also speak Chinese, Japanese, or a European language."
"John & Bill, you mean like at ticket offices in New York and London where the staff speak multiple languages?"
"For a country that attracts 40m visitors a year, I am astonished that there is not even a tourist office in Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai, or Phuket. If you go to TAT head office near Phetchaburi MRT, there was a guy there that spoke English, but when I asked a question about trips all he did was a Google search and told me what I knew already."
Visited Hua Lamphong station this morning. Foreigners ticket office has been closed for 3 years and is now used as a store room. Foreigners and Thai now use the same ticket booths. Pics available on request.
"Hi,Thanks for the update, any luck or more info regarding a ticket for your trip down to Hua Hin on Friday?"
Thanks AjarnAndy and others. All sorted now. For the Fiday train I could buy a ticket on Wednesday. About 400 baht one way.
"Hi,I guess you are travelling down on train 43 which is an express service. Have a good journey down and enjoy Hua Hin."
"My gf phoned their information line begining of week. With COVID-19, they were waiting till Wednesday to decide if the train was going to run."
#14 Bill Isn't it amazing how two posters who imply considerable experience of Thailand have joined TA this month and both have found this thread for their one and only contribution. Not only that but they are both completely wrong I image someone is setting up false accounts any guess who?The old foreigners office down the right hand side looking down the tracks has indeed been closed for some years and it was replaced first by another small a/c office near where the shops on the left are and that was also closed and last time I looked there was a small area at the ticket offices dedicated to foreigners. I have no idea about what is being provided during the current situation BUT one thing I am certain of is that at Hualampong there are absolutely no problems in finding Thai Railway staff who speak decent English even now
"I forgot to mention that I noticed an information counter opposite the entrance to the booking hall. The girl spoke passable English, although off beat questions (non time table related) she had difficulty with, but did answer.Facing the booking counters, the information counter is on the right."
"Hi,It's been there for as long as I can remember and the persons who work there are helpful. Good luck for Friday!"
