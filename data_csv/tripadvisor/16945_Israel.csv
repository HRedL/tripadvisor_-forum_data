is it safe to travel to Israel with all those snipers around????
Welcome to the Israel forum!Which snipers are you talking about? It is very safe to travel in Israel. The streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are considered safer than London's. You'd witness it the moment you set foot in the country.
"With all the terror attacks in London, trust me -- you are not in danger in Israel.The ""snipers"" are probably a reference to Gaza. You'll be nowhere near there. It's not a factor.Douglas Duckett"
"This isnâ€™t a zero-sum game, folks... The streets of London, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are all safe."
Definitely a troll.
I have no idea where you read or heard about snipers but that is simply so far from the reality that I would doubt any other information that comes from that source.
"hello Oreet, a pleasure to hear from you again - I see all the good persons like Chana, rdglady and some others are still here (no Yuri though, I was careful to check before I said anything! (joke).I was indeed planning a return trip in the coming couple of months - did not manage it in January - but just to Tel Aviv.This is not a political blog, and I am loathe to discuss it, will drop you a private line, if you don't mind. That is better.Regards,"
"I can only guess that the snipers in question are snipers on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. If that's the case - while the events there are disturbing, this is a very isolated and localized flashpoint nowhere near where any tourist is going to go.As noted, Israel is safe. And I agree with Astolat - that simple message isn't helped by making unnecessary and inaccurate comments about other places."
"I wasn't suggesting London isn't safe, I'm sorry if that was interpreted as such.As the OP is from London, I just wanted to give him a base for comparison.P.S - Yeah, I love Yuri's jokes as well :)"
"Israel is as safe as always. Please don't watch the news, or at least very what our see/hear visit reliable Israeli sources.ChanaIsrael"
"My point is NOT that London is not safe. My point is that London has had a number of terror attacks. As has Paris, and my country, and the list goes on. Israel is not more dangerous in terms of those issues -- this is a reality in the world, we still live our lives, and we still travel.Israel is very safe, and that is what matters.Douglas Duckett"
There has been an epidemic of stabbings on the streets of London this year.......

"Thank you gentlemen. From my experience (and I have travelled to many countries, so have some basis for comparison) I can say that for a tourist Israel is pretty safe. We certainly felt no need for abnormal caution, as we have felt in other cities like Rome, Cairo, Prague or Delhi. In fact I was surprised how tourists are not bothered in Jerusalem East or West (We found Palestinians to be very polite, also in Bethlehem)The comments about terrorism in these other cities is a bit crass (and easily deflected - no one lives in daily fear of it), but speaking as a Tourist, Israel compares pretty well.We plan Tel Aviv, with 2 days in Nazareth to the north which we did not manage last time."
"hello friends,  I am curious as to why my post (response to Shaul01) regarding Jerusalem and Israel being safe in comparison to other cities was removed? It was entirely inoffensive, so I am a bit puzzled. I am assured that there is no censorship on this blog except where there are community complaints.Thank you."
