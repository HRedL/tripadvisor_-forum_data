"Hi,. Can I use cash in France or just cards? Thanks."
What have you heard that would leave the impression that cash was not accepted somewhere?
"It would certainly be useful to learn the current situation in France.Certainly in Belgium the use of a card (debit only for small sums) has become the norm while restrictions are in place, even at the majority of places that didn't accept cards at all previously. I have only paid cash once - to the local hairdresser - in the last three months, and, just this morning, I was expected to use a card to purchase a € 1,50 loaf of bread, something unthinkable four months ago."
The current situation varies by merchant.
Actually in France like in Belgium it is against the law to refuse euros cash as payment (except for very large amounts). That's good to know when people refuse it.
"As Pierre said, it is forbidden for a shop to refuse cash payment (up to 1000€). If they are not in a good mood they can say that they don't have change for you (that's allowed) so in that case it's easier to hand the correct amount. Info in French : https:/…A14022 (use Google Translate).A lot of people are reluctant to use cash now as they fear it's a source of contamination, since cash touches so many different hands, so card payment (especially contactless payment) is on the rise at the moment but cash cannot be refused."
"#1: ""Euros are used in EU countries other than the UK""One, this isn't true, and two, OP was not asking what unit of currency is used in France (one would expect someone living in Spain to be well acquainted with that).Clearly given the current situation with the SARS CoV-2 virus, the use of cash has become at least somewhat of a concern as Soph5035 mentions above and that seems to be the obvious explanation for the OP's question. And. even with a law that mandates acceptance of cash, it wouldn't be unreasonable to ask if those laws have been suspended or just not enforced during these obviously very non-normal times."
