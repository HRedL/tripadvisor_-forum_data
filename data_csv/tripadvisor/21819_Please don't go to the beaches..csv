"Just saw on Chron that the beaches at Point Reyes were packed yesterday. This is just crazy. This virus is going to last a lot longer and kill a lot more people because we can't get the concept of shelter at home.When China force quarantine her citizens, some here thought that's draconian. And that we are glad we live in a free country. The casinos are still open in Vegas. The sky slopes are still open in Colorado. Well, freedom is going to kill us."
"Yeah, people behaving badly. This was also happening along the San Mateo County coast.https:/…If folks don’t want even stricter restrictions to be imposed, they need to not be selfish and shortsighted, and be responsible, mature adults. Or at least pretend they are and try to act like it."
"Same in Santa Cruz County, our beaches and hiking trails. Not everyone is keeping a safe distance.We want these places to stay open so please use common sense. If it’s crowded come back another time.Edited: 1:41 pm, March 22, 2020 "
More of Point Reyes is being closed down to public access because that seems to be the way to keep order when so many people are like little children and want instant gratification and have no self-discipline.https:/…photo-19201671
Lots of people at the beach in Pacifica yesterday.

"Good idea to walk in our own neighborhoods or visit parks that aren't as popular. We do that regularly anyway, and it's a great way to explore and to get some fresh air and exercise."
"""If it’s crowded come back another time.""Or better yet, go for a walk in our own neighborhoods, or if necessary drive to a small park near home that doesn't get so much ""love.""Ironically, the Chronicle had an editorial patting the Bay Area and California on the back for being so proactive about sheltering in place and social distancing, and called it a model for other places to emulate. Too bad so many people's behavior isn't so exemplary."
So many in Santa Cruz consider the beach their backyard. Not the best choice right now.  The problem is they seem to congregating at the busiest areas. There are plenty of empty beaches. Miles with few people in south county. Plus a lot of Bay Area people came for the weekend to just getaway. Our room rates haven’t fallen much. Our rangers were patrolling the beaches and reminded people to keep their distance and no just hanging. It’s going to be so much worse when the weather gets better with all the teenagers out of school. That will probably trigger a closing of the beaches.
"I watched a video yesterday with a doctor saying we need a mandatory 3 week quarantine to stop this virus. He said current ""shelter at home"" orders that allow people to go out shopping will only spread the virus, not stop it. He said only health care workers and LE should be exempt from a mandatory quarantine to provide care for the sick and maintain order. There was more said, but I'll leave it at that.The more people mingling with other people (Stores, restaurants, etc.), the more likelihood of exposure.I told my sister yesterday how packed the Vons parking lot across the street from me is and that people must be stocking up on Corona. And I didn't mean the beer.Just stay home peopleEdited: 3:02 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Ocean Beach is in fact in the backyard of our San Francisco home, but there is no reason for outsiders to go there, especially now. Not a great beach for those looking for a “beach experience” but perfectly okay for strolling in normal times. But in normal times, it will be sparsely used.One of the more disturbing things is going with the entire family to a supermarket as an “outing”.....please stop doing that. The supermarket is an essential place not a walking venue."
"Umm, the Hotels and Casinos in Las Vegas are NOT open."
They were open until very recently.
"And the mayor of Las Vegas is 6¡+(#¡n9. She wants the governor to cut the state of emergency time in half, because the city's economy is so reliant on tourism that being dark for several weeks would be totally devastating. Many hotel, casino, and restaurant employees are low-paid and live day to day, and many businesses might have to fold.She said Las Vegas is not like New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco. She's right; those cities don't have all or most of their eggs in the tourism and entertainment basket, which is the first to go when tough times come. Over recent decades, Las Vegas wagered its destiny on hedonism, with mammoth new palaces of pleasure and vast housing areas, square mile after square mile of cookie-cutter homes and townhouses. It got hit hard in 2008, but here we are again.I'm sorry LV isn't like the other acronym cities. This will be hardest on the working people. But does the city really want to reopen to the 40,000,000+ visitors who flock there every year, transiting through the airport from every part of the world, packing casinos, clubs, and restaurants, swarming along the Strip day and night within inches of hundreds of other people?"
"It doesnt matter what the Mayor Wants right now. The Governor of Nevada has said non essential businesses will be closed for at least 30 days. Just like everywhere else. Alot of the Hotels had already closed or in the process before the Mandate went out from the Governor on Tuesday.But it is quite bad here for folks. Tips were a very large part of peoples pay and they will only receive basic wages through unemployment, so cuts their actual wages by at least 50 to 75 percent without those tips.Edited: 7:28 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"People going to the beaches and parks are probably not thinking ahead. For example, restrooms are closed.In terms of the Mayor of Las Vegas, she needs to look at Hawaii. The governor now requires visitors to be stuck in quarantine for 14 days inside their hotel room before they can go out. Why even fly to Hawaii right now."
"I see Marin just closed all of its parks, including Mt. Tam, Stinson, Muir Woods, Point Reyes....https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Marin…The inability of folks to exercise restraint is quite breathtaking.....literally maybe they will help take breath away from people."
"Kind of related. Bad behavior is not limited to the US of course. Hong Kong, for example, is seeing an uptick of cases because many students returning from Europe and US do not self quarantine. Instead they still go out to socialize at bars. And this is a city which went through SARS."
"Hypothetical because it’s sounds like they have, but can Marin close federal parks? TSS, very likely those young people don’t remember SARS."
"Watching the local news in San Diego. Carlsbad packed. Trail packed. SD closing down public parking near beaches like Mission Bay.FOMO in play imho. If others do it, why should I refrain.....a damaging sentiment.Driven in part of recent rain and clearing a bit today."
Just back from the beach. What did I miss?
"In the end on a gross basis SARS killed under 1,000 people, while 15,000 are already dead from Covid 19. Statistically there vas a high death rate for SARS because a lower number of infected, and probably a lower one for Covid 19 in the end. But it is the gross numbers that are scary."
"""...can Marin close federal parks?""If they don't have that legal authority, the next best thing is to close the roads leading in. Restrict them to residents or property owners, then have police be hall monitors when they could be doing actual public safety work."
"https:/…But California isn't the only place with a problem. https://www.kgw.com/article/news/health/coro…https:/…And there are others. Clearly, coronavirus isn't the only contagious virus, but you CAN ""fix"" coronavirus in non-fatal cases.Edited: 12:17 am, March 23, 2020 "
Casinos in LV closed Tuesday March 17th at 23:59:59Most Ski resorts in Colorado and Utah closed their lifts March 15th (people can still hike/skinny-up and ski down ... but there is no ski patrol or avalanche mitigation)
"I saw an overhead aerial shot of the beach near the Santa Monica Pier and while there were folks there, they were quite spread out (not playing Beach Blanket Bingo for example) and the distance looked more than safe to me. Later on the same newscast showed an aerial shot of a Florida beach and it was so crowded I could not believe it. Night and day difference."
Was everyone on that beach 6’ away from everyone else? And were those in groups all members of the same household? And when all these people went back to their cars were they all able to stay 6’ away from each other? I doubt that the answer to all these questions was ‘yes.’It’s why Marin county closed all its parks and beaches. People are not paying attention.
These mayors of Italian towns say it soooo much better. A disclaimer I read said the translations were very accurate. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KxtGJsnLgSc
">>Was everyone on that beach 6’ away from everyone else? And were those in groups all members of the same household? And when all these people went back to their cars were they all able to stay 6’ away from each other?I doubt that the answer to all these questions was ‘yes.’<<My wife and I went to Coronado on Sat for about 2 hours, Coronado is obviously a very wide beach so it allows for a lot of open space. I can answer yes to all of those questions, although I cant speak for anyone else that was at Coronado.Edited: 6:07 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"What I saw in Pacifica two days ago was a moderately crowded beach where it seemed like you had groups of families or friends near each other, but each group kept their distance from other groups. Yesterday was less crowded and people were more scattered. I didn't actually step onto the beach. You get a great view of Linda Mar beach as you're driving south on Highway 1, though."
"If you buy into the seriousness of the situation you shouldn’t be hanging with your besties at the beach, or anywhere elseEdited: 6:41 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"City of SD beaches are closing which includes, OB, MB, PB, LJ, TP as well as parks and trails.No word on beaches, parks, trails in other SD County cities."
"I have been hearing a lot about ""block parties"" where neighbors sit in their driveways or in their yards, and talk to the neighbors across the street or next door. Others are hanging out on their balconies and talking across the breezeway or the alley to friends and neighbors. I don't see this as being much different from sitting at the beach 15 feet from your friends. Of course people may or may not give proper distance when going to and from their cars at the beach - that is definitely something to consider - also the issue of public bathroom use. But I don't see going to the beach as inherently a bad thing."
"Pismo Beach just closed the recently opened Pismo Preserve hiking trails because there are too many people hitting the trails, which makes it nearly impossible for hikers to avoid close contact.We've been told that walking and hiking are okay. I can tell you that many are ignoring the call to shelter at home and going about their lives as if there isn't a care in the world. We have teenagers locally who've tested positive. So much for the ""It doesn't seem to affect those under 19 YO"" claim."
"If proper distancing was happening, then beaches and parks wouldn’t be closed. Obviously that’s not happening and city/county officials feel they have to crack down."
"The Oregon governor issued a shelter at home order, I believe today, and included a misdemeanor charge applicable to anyone out and about for non essential reasons. Californians better brace themselves. It will get to a point where finding TP will be the least of their problems."
"Bay Area officials are irate about the weekend crowds at parks and beaches, and the governor has ordered parking at state parks and beaches closed to prevent people from gathering. https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/M…https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/S…https:/…"
"Please Bay Area when the weather gets better stay home. Don’t head to the beaches of Santa Cruz. If you overwhelm our beaches more beaches will be closed for residents. Here’s a list of parking areas already closed to prevent people from driving carloads of families to the beach. More expected to be added soon.  https://www.thatsmypark.org/about/covid-19/Edited: 9:54 am, March 24, 2020 "
"I was hoping that it wouldn't come to these kinds of closures - that education and public awareness would be enough. There are tons of places to get outside in the Bay Area - plenty for all who want to go outside to do so and still maintain the proper distancing. And in the coming weeks and months, we are going to need that for exercise, mental health, and balance. We just can't all go to the same places."
"So how would you ration that? You would need to set up a reservation system for every parking spot at a popular park. In the near term, that is not practical.Maybe you require the last digit of the license plate to match the last digit of the day."
"Yes we can’t all go to the same spots. If it’s crowded find another spot. My husband and I went to Nicene ( or Nisene) Marks on Saturday and turned around because it was so crowded. This park is practically in our backyard and it was more crowded this Saturday than a month ago when the weather was better. I think the license plate idea is a great one. I remember having to do that when I was kid for gasoline. That can’t be too hard to implement. What worries me for my area and other popular spots is when the weather gets nicer and Easter week. So many people are used to coming over for family picnics but it just can’t happen this year. I’m hoping Seacliff State Beach closes the picnic tables. I’m only guessing but from what I’ve heard I expect them to close the parking lot at Seacliff around Easter. Plus we need more rangers.Edited: 11:08 am, March 24, 2020 "
"My uncle said the same thing about Nisene Marks . It was just too crowded, so he didn't hike. More people need to make those types of decisions like you guys did - if there are too many people, just leave. Find another place to be. We are planning a hike at a Santa Clara county park this Saturday - we are choosing the park and our hike carefully based on the number of people we typically see. The hike we are planning Saturday is in a park where we typically see no more than 10 cars in the parking lot and maybe pass 5 or 6 people over the course of an 8 mile hike. We are not doing a couple of hikes we had planned for this spring (pre-COVID plans) because we know those trails are generally too busy for proper distancing. There is a park near my house with nice walking paths where we like to walk - but when we went over there the other day, we felt that there were too many people out walking, so we didn't go in the park and just stuck to city sidewalks for our exercise. It was fine. We passed a few people on the sidewalks, but everybody was pretty good with distancing. I don't know how we will ration the outdoor spaces - but if a solution can be found that keeps the spaces open and facilitates proper distancing, I am all for it."

"This is why we can't have nice things.More parks and beaches will close this week because too many people were irresponsible last week.https:/…“In many parks in the East Bay, restrooms were closed after visitors stole toilet paper and antiseptic soap.”* Eye roll *"
For those thinking of a day trip to Santa Cruz cross it off your list. Virtually all the beach parking lots will closed. Henry Cowell will also be closed. Here’s a list a list of all the parks and parking areas that are closed. https://www.thatsmypark.org/about/covid-19/…
"Even though parking lots are closed, one can still get on Ocean Beach, for example, in San Francisco. Just don’t ruin accessibility by failing to maintain social distancing."
"Our county, Santa Cruz, is going to enforce no parking in neighborhoods to get to the beach. We do this in certain neighborhoods in the summer but it will start now for all neighborhoods. It’s really too bad for locals that live farther from the beach and those that have a hard time walking far distances. If people start flocking to the beach and trails anyway they will close it all, not just the parking. Our county had to crackdown because so many came from over the hill to make a day of it last weekend. It was busier here than a typical spring weekend. There was so many people there is no way it was just residents. This goes into affect just before Easter for a reason. No one is happy about it but if it will keep people out of our county then it has to be done."
Young people. Think they are invincible. Need more fines and arrests.
"This will be the second weekend following state wide SIP, and the weather looks great in Southern California with light rain in the San Francisco Bay Area. Hopefully the closures that occurred after the first weekend, and that and some greater self awareness will mean fewer selfish people who will not social distance themselves or flock to recreation areas outside their neighborhoods."
LA County (and Long Beach City) Beaches are closed through April 19 (May 1st for LB) at least.https://covid19.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uplo…
I hope so Liars. Hopefully if we all abide by the shelter in place this will be over sooner rather than later. Luckily we have a rainy weekend so it’s a good one to stay close to home.
