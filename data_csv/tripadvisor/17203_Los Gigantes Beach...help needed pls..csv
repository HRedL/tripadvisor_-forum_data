"While I can't say for definite I think it is pretty unlikely that the LG beach will be open in the near future.There is a very small beach in Puerto Santiago round by the harbour just a short walk from you. Like Los Gigantes it is black volcanic sand.A little further on is Playa de la Arena - A small, blue flag beach with great views of La Gomera. It is small 250 just metres. The water can sometimes be quite rough with high waves. Care needs to be taken because there are underwater currents, depending on the weather and the waves it can sometimes be dangerous. If the sea is rough it is difficult to see the big rocks which are just below the surface and the beach can only be partly recommended for children as there is a steep drop in the water quite close to the edge.Playa San Juan - A bus ride away but it does have two beaches. One used mainly by the locals is black sand and just a few steps further on there was until the storms 2 weeks ago a beautiful new beach a bit two tone but very nice, despite all of the rain cutting through it and leaving a small valley down to the sea.The west was quite badly hit demotix.com/news/â€¦storm-damage-san-juan-beach"
