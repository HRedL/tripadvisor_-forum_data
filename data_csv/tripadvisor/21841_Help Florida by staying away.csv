"For time being, we should stop going to Orlando and other popular destinations so we can help stabilize the virus."
Now it has begun.There will be locked down by states to prevent people from traveling to another state.It is coming.
Seems like you should be more worried about your own state. If you actually live there and aren’t just a troll...

Littlebiffone can you not just stay in one thread. There is no need to spam every single thread with links that people can find themselves. Good lord.
"You are correct that there are ""links that people can find for themselves.""From the standpoint of information and public safety, the concern is what is in those links."
And there is no need to post them over and over. Most in these forums won’t even click on links.
"Residents and potential visitors who wish to verify whether the statement in Post 4 is accurate, and wish to follow the data and course of developments in Florida, may click on the link at: https:/…"
People that want info can simply go to local sites. No need to click your 50 different sitesWww.wftv.comWww.wesh.comWww.wkmg.comOr any other news source if they want numbers.

I think World corona virus meter is really interesting it is not opinionated just factual.
MS one is much more visual:https://www.bing.com/covid
Tenni is right. People won't click on those links. I don't understand the need to post the same thing again and again. The OP is trolling.
Or maybe he ( or she) is trying to get people to see what’s really happening......
"Florida's epidemic is well established and growing rapidly. It doesn't much matter if additional infected people show up, everything's set up for an explosive growth in infections, hospital patients, and deaths. The models at this site are very approximate and change as new data become available. But they're useful. Pick the USA as a whole or whatever state you want.https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections"
Who are these people that don’t see what is happening? It’s not like the numbers are a secret. You can check the WHO or the CDC and get updated information.
"Post 19:“ Who are these people that don’t see what is happening?”On awareness, timeliness and effectiveness, a concern is whether the Governor has been one person."

"When you read someone slur another as a troll, wonder why they do that—instead of offering their skill and judgment to avert the projected 5,568 deaths in Florida under these conditions: “State-mandated social distancingStay at home order:Not implementedEducational facilities closed:March 17, 2020Non-essential services closed:Not implemented“Travel severely limited:Not implemented“http://covid19.healthdata.org/"
"With best-case predictions now of 100,000-240,000 US fatalities, why do some condescend to slur others and their views on what might work for Florida?"
"Ultimate solution is finding the medicine/vaccine to get rid off Virus.Governor is doing all they can to minimize the damage. The longer the virus stays, the longer state would be hurt.Next 2 weeks would be crucial."

Let’s hope for Florida’s sake he is right . ( sadly I don’t think he is)
"In his decision on a statewide stay-at-home order, the Governor may wish to afford the CDC Report released yesterday such weight as he determines to be warranted and appropriate.The Report urged—beyond the elderly residents of Florida (about 4 million):“What are the implications for public health practice?Strategies to protect all persons and especially those with underlying health conditions***should be implemented by all communities and all persons to help slow the spread of COVID-19.”Edited: 7:45 am, April 01, 2020 "
How long do you as people who live in the USA believe that social distancing and travel restrictions will be in place.I know Heir Trump has said till end of April..but what is the feeling of the people who live their ?
"Gaze based on the data for the peak of infections, and the daily briefing at my hospital, we are preparing for several months of dedicated social distancing. Maybe July things may get relatively normal. New York May reach their peak in the next two weeks, the rest of the country will take longer.Edited: 8:40 am, April 01, 2020 "
"Those concerned with public health, and those who would slur them as trolls, are now united on one issue.The issue is not whether a statewide stay-at-home order by the Governor is a good idea.The issue is whether—to be effective—an order now Is too late.Edited: 8:44 am, April 01, 2020 "
Obviously.
"Do you trust what’s going on for your protection? Read this:Post 26: “The is “no statewide shutdown for Florida, DeSantis says, because [the] White House hasn’t advised it.” “March 31,WFLA reports: “When asked about Gov. DeSantis' comments on stay-at-home order, VP Pence says White House Task Force is deferring the decision to states.”Edited: 10:59 am, April 01, 2020 "
"I think Mr. Trump has come round. He decided to defer to the experts. I cannot tell you how relieved that made me. All we have now is the ability to quarantine in the hopes it may help slow things down and help alleviate the pressure this puts on our hospitals and healthcare workers, not to mention emergency responders. Everyone needs to just stay put, wherever that may be. Not easy, but the least painful choice. Here in U.S., I think it is all just beginning. And the most truthful straightforward thing I have heard Trump say is that it is going to be “very bad.”Scared for the world right now. I have family all over. It all feels like everyone responded a beat too slow, but it happened so fast. I am still bothered by a doctor back home who berated me when I told him we should not be shaking hands. He went off on me. Told me I was more likely to die in a lawn mower accident. IDK what I even just wrote. Just need to vent. Everyone please stay home till further instructions. Or better yet, listen to reason. The sensible thing is to stay home. You don’t have to wait for an order to figure that out."
