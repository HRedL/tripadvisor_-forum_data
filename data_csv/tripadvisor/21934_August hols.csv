"Hi we are supposed to be going to Parga in the last week of August,and I know no one has a crystal ball :-) but there seems to be some hope that we would be able to travel.Though this may involve some restrictions. We need to pay our balance or reschedule for 2021bu Sunday 31st At the moment we of course want to go but are scared re quarantine requirements etc. Just wondered what others are doing for Aug/Sept hols that may help us come to a decision thanks"
"Unfortunately no one knows. Depends how long the quarantine in both arriving in Greece, & coming back to the UK will continue for.Also social distancing & wearing of facial coverings, would that impact your holiday?Our June holiday has obviously been cancelled, & we are due to go away again in September, although not to Parga, & are trying to move it back to later in the year, as personally not comfortable at flying this soon."
"It really depends on how much the uncertainty of what’s involved in going away this year actually bothers you. If you find it all very unsettling, I would transfer to next year and keep your balance in your own account for now. Some of the restrictions currently applying could get lifted but, also, maybe not, depending on how things develop. I’ll post a couple of useful links below so you can see what the initial restrictions will entail when holidaying in Greece."
Do bear in mind that the restrictions might ease if circumstances seem right. https:/…

Thank you so much for the information
You’re welcome. This is another thread you might want to keep an eye on if you do decide to stick with this year’s plans. It gets updated frequently with any new Greek government regulations affecting tourism.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
I was Googling Harry Theoharis the Greek Minister For Tourism yesterday (trying to find a contact e-mail address) and came across a couple of his recent posts. Apparently travel to Greece can resume on June 15th but only to Athens and then only for certain countries. There was a list of nineteen permitted countries and the UK wasn't one of them but interesting to note that China was !! All other international airports will be allowed to re-open from July 1st but I couldn't see if the approved list had been amended to include the UK but I note TUI have a flight listed on Sunday July 5th from Manchester to Preveza (the day we should fly) so things look encouraging. (The Wife doesn't believe me Ha Ha) He also said there would be no quarantine or isolation period which again is encouraging.
"Interesting article https:/…The Author says there is no list of approved countries yet but leaks are listing nineteen.He also says ""On July 1 (Stage 2) Greece will allow ﬂights from abroad to all airports in the country and free entry of visitors from all countries."" Note he says ""all countries"""
"I think the best, most accurate, way of keeping yourself informed on latest developments is to check this thread, which gets updated frequently with factual information when new announcements affecting tourism are made by the Greek government.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…"
"@Silver-fox-two""The Author says there is no list of approved countries yet but leaks are listing nineteen.""I don't know if what I've read are proposals but the 19 countries (later amended to 20 to include Germany) has been discussed on the Crete...now thread for some days. This article is dated 21st May.https:/…and lists 20 countries.From the article:<>You may be lucky if the UK are included in the July 1st group."
"#10Thanks Paula, I'll have a look shortly."
"This from ITV.comGreece will open its doors to overseas holidaymakers from July 1, but the UK is not expected to be on a list of countries allowed back in.The country's long-awaited tourist season will begin on June 15 with the opening of seasonal hotels, while international flights will be able to fly directly to Greece's main tourist spots from the beginning of July.A list of countries from which visitors will be able to arrive in Greece will be announced before the end of May.The selection will be based on “epidemiological criteria” as determined by Greece’s committee of experts dealing with the pandemic.But the Greek tourism minister Haris Theoharis told ITV News that the UK's record on coronavirus is currently not good enough for Britons to be allowed to visithttps:/…"
And yesterday from the Daily Telegraph.https:/…
Re reply #13:The article is dated 20th May.
"Re reply #15 And the situation has not changed in Greece.The next official announcement will be on Friday.Edited: 2:50 pm, May 27, 2020 "
"#13 ""Greece will open its doors to overseas holidaymakers from July 1, but the UK is not expected to be on a list of countries allowed back in."" In one of Harry's earlier posts he said that from July 1st Greece will be open to people from all countries. Probably why TUI are showing a flight from Manchester to Prevaza on July 5th."

"We are booked for Nidri st the end of August. Things are changing quite fast now so it’s possible this might go ahead. I’ve paid in full for the holiday and assume we’ll get money back if it can’t happen. It’s something to look forward to and, if it can go ahead, I would be very sad I had cancelled."
