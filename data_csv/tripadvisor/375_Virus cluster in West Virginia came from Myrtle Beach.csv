WSAZ: COVID-19 cluster in W.Va. county linked to travel to Myrtle Beach.https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/COVID-19-câ€¦
"Didn't know that 3 is a ""cluster"", but anyway. LOTS of people from WV vacation in MB. Hard to keep them away...even during times like this."
"Local MB news just reported the WV cluster is up to 8 confirmed cases.Edited: 6:16 pm, June 17, 2020 "
Thanks PawleysDude for your local updated information. I always rely on the locals and local news for the most accurate information
Local news reporting it could be over 20 cases. It was a group of high school seniors who traveled to MB for Senior week
"Perhaps one person in the group infected all the others, not that 20 people got sick from being in MB."
"Interviews by the WV Public Health Department indicated all of the initial 8 had made a recent visit to MB. Regardless, what difference does it make? That's how this disease spreads. One, or a small group, make bad decisions then continue to make bad decisions, spreading it to even more people. It's a same bet before this cluster is over, it will involve people who had not been to MB."
"ravzie, that's how the virus works."
