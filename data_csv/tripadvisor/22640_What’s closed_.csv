I’m going April 15th. As of right now what big things are shut down?
The whole town.
"MGM Buffets,, Some Mandalay Bay restaurants, and possibly maybe some things at Mirage."
Heard all shows at Caesars shut down.
"We are also arriving on the 15th. I'm worried about domestic airlines being banned from travel. Our rental villa is not willing to refund my $5k and my travel insurance won't pay for it since it's an epidemic/pandemic. I have three days to decide before final payment on the rental. I have purchased numerous show tickets and other tickets for attractions/tours.Edited: 10:58 pm, March 11, 2020 "
It doesn't matter what we type. It will be out of date tomorrow.
"^^^You are right, here in Seattle they just mandated that all events with more than 250 people are to be cancelled starting on Friday. That is all sporting events, concerts, conventions, charity events, etc. This can happen in Vegas just as easily and just as fast. You can be in Vegas and on your way to a show and it can be cancelled."
"""It doesn't matter what we type. It will be out of date tomorrow.""This. Things are changing dramatically from day to day."
I have tickets for this weekend and have not received any notification of this. Where did you get your information from? Thanks
I truly am shell shocked right now. You don't even have time to process things before it gets worse.
>>I have tickets for this weekend and have not received any notification of this<<You have tickets for what?

"Yep, before long, all of it will be closed. 13"
If the NBA suspends their season why would we think that ANYTHING in Vegas or elsewhere would not be suspended at some future time ?
"Collinsclan...events scheduled after Friday in Washington state in King, Pierce, and Snohomish County with over 250 attendees were cancelled for the month of March. In Seattle and King County all events must meet certain standards to continue. Got the info directly from the Governor's mouth via Breaking News on King 5 (I'm sure you have heard by now). I live in Pierce County was coming to Vegas March 31st-April 5th, booked at the Mirage. I am going to postpone my trip to later in the Summer. I don't want to be there at the height of the panic when Las Vegas's numbers start to rapidly increase and more venues shut down.I am very saddened for what is to come for all the the hard workers in Las Vegas. This is going to hit the service industry very hard, as it has done here in Seattle. We all need to help everyone as much as possible and hopefully the government will step in and bail out the service industry like they did the banks. This pandemic is not their fault and they deserve all the help they can get. I personally will be returning to Vegas as soon as I can to help them in their recovery. I am also supporting small local business's here in my area to hopefully keep them afloat."

You should thank your lucky stars if your Criss Angel show has been canceled and you get your money back.
Golden Knights (and all NHL) games now suspended indefinitely.
"""You should thank your lucky stars if your Criss Angel show has been canceled and you get your money back.""This is just uncalled for at this time. You might not like the show but what about everyone who works to set the show up? All the ushers, concession workers, lighting, electricians, etc... You really want them to be without a paycheck?You might have tried to be funny but at this time it really is uncalled for and just cold and unfeeling.Edited: 1:24 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"""You might like the show but what about everyone who works to set the show up?""I'm assuming this sentence is missing the word ""not."""
"""I'm assuming this sentence is missing the word ""not.""""Where am I missing the word not?"
Just got confirmation that AOW is cancelled :(
"BigDaddy,I *think* that the reference is to the first part of the sentence, “You May [Not] be a fan... “however, I could be very wrong?Hunt"
That guy is a jerk to speak to you like that and to judge someone’s taste in a show! Rude!
PGA just suspended play. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think we are all sportsless. Really sucks for the sports books's staff as they are now effectively closed.
"Upstate, that was my last sport i could wager on in my Sportsbook , unless you consider darts a sport"
“ Just got confirmation that AOW is cancelled :(”Bummer. But as much I try to figure out what AOW is...I can’t. Someone please enlighten me so I can slap my forehead.
"I’m trying to figure out what AOW is also. I know while we are there we wanted to do the high roller, New York New York piano bar, caesars palace buffet, and carrot top. Only time will tell what will still be available come April. Let me know if anyone hears of these things closing please"
I'm sure this was mentioned somewhere but don't see it as I arrived today here. The sports book at V/P are closing they said and turned there system off this afternoon. I was going to try and get a futures Stanke Cup NHL be and they said no more bets for obvious reasons now. On another note all feels normal other than that in casino and resort. Reasonably busy.
I wouldn't be surprised if this weekend is busier than normal. One last hurrah before the party is over so to speak.
Last Hurrah? Party over? Are we talking about Sin City or some small town in Alabama?
Per whomever might be interested:https:/…
I have tickets to Daniel Tosh at the Mirage for the 21st. I am trying to figure out how to get a refund or credit but so far it looks like he is still appearing and no refunds. I know I won’t be there as I cancelled my trip which was supposed to start yesterday. I am staying home and waiting this out and avoiding travel.
The OP's trip is a month away. Who knows?
MGM just announce closing all spas/ fitness centers
"I suggest once we get past this weekend that this thread be shut down and replaced with one called ""What's open?"""
"Upstate_guy #36,That was going to be my comment, but you beat me to it.Probably by Monday, the “what’s open” list will be the shorter one.Best of luck to all,lhunt"
"As Team America would say: “America, F yeah!”Let’s do it folks. Let’s kick it’s booty and save Vegas. We can do it!13Edited: 8:33 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Looks like a lot you will have to get blitzed at home and maybe host card parties since your ""Happy Place"" is slowly getting shut down."
Wynn Sports Book and Poker Room is closing on Sunday until further notice.
Is tonight the first night some people we're going to get stuck with Rod Stewart tickets because he was playing but they couldn't come? Or did he finally cancel?
It seems as if the show must go on which is also what Dana White is doing with the UFC. I don’t really under stand why. It’s going to get worse before it gets better.
"That's the best idea, Hunt."
Yes I’m going this Monday an didn’t get anything either
"We joked that we're gonna open an underground poker room in my now shuttered bar and call it ""The Quarantine Room."" I've got 200 cases of White Claw ans 50 St Patty's Day Bud Light cases for comped drinks. We'll replace Vegas!Edited: 12:29 am, March 14, 2020 "
Shorty was well behaved last night ...for a change.Did you counsel him ?
Currently a couple of buffets but as of last night shows were still on. Were monitoring it from on the ground but nothing yet. Crowds are still here
Pretty soon the question will be what's not closed.
Where did you get that info. I'm here stuff open everywhere last night
Just saw that the Cosmopolitan is closing some restaurants. It’s possible other hotels will follow suit. Cirq at Treasure Island is only doing 7:00 shows... but that may change.
Don’t know where you heard this...S. I JUST cancelled trip first week April and called Caesars where I bought a $200 ticket for show. They keep saying no refunds...we will take your name and number and get back to you before show date...don’t want a reschedule right now..want a refund!!
"Nuzzja, he's got all of us badgering him now. I think maybe the fact that my brother and I shut our bar down totally might've knocked some sense into him!"
Penn Jillette just posted that Penn and Teller is going on hiatus.
Jonas brothers canceled their residency.
""" Jonas Brothers canceled their residency. "" The world is ending."
"I'm staying in Vegas for work currently but, I'm sure we'll probably be leaving soon. The state of Nevada went into State of Emergency on Thursday. After a woman who had Corona attened a huge conference at Mirage. She was staying at MGM. All live shows and buffets have been closing down. So are most venues where crowds of people would gather that would put staff at risk. We are being sent back home from working down here due to the HIGH RISK of exposure in Las Vegas. Several people have traveled here and were still traveling here until the ban. I wouldn't risk my health getting on a flight to come here, to these germ increased hotels if I were you. Whatever you decided good luck, because after staying here for three months in these casinos I'm sure they are covered with bacteria & germs from those filthy non-disinfected slot machines. I'm nervous every time I have to get on the elevator now."
Officially closed are MGM properties and Wynn properties.https:/…
Caesars is canceling all live shows.https:/…coronavirus-guest-information
"As mentioned above, the short list is likely “what’s open?”Best of luck,Hunt"
"What’s closed? Everything, if not now, soon."
"up where i live, they just shut down all in-person dining and all bars. just got back from the grocery store, and bread, dairy, and eggs were all gone. i bought a bunch of non-perishable stuff, and am going to use this opportunity to control portions and try to lose a few lbs. silver linings."
"From the Mob Museum's web site:""The Mob Museum is temporarily suspending all public operations until further notice."""
"My beloved Wynn is shutting down March 17 hoping to reopen on the 1st of April but probably not. :(Had I not canceled that would have been the day we checked into the WynnEdited: 2:26 am, March 16, 2020 "
How's your Mom taking it all in angelina? Hopefully better than my 78 year old father who isn't listening at all!
UG....I know exactly what you mean !
"The Trump Foundation closed, too."
"DTC it’s interesting you can’t find anyone who voted for him yet he’s in charge.Edited: 9:29 am, March 16, 2020 "

"This is correct, I have spoken with Ceasars Entertainment today. All shows have been canceled until atleast April 1st; this will most likely change though as things progress"
I have show ticket for April 8th...so hoping it goes into April for refunds!
"https://www.ktnv.com/news/gov-steve-sisolak-…Nevada is under a quarantine for all non essential businesses, so as everyone else has said, Las Vegas entertainment is officially 100% closed as of the Wednesday the 18th at noon for 30 days.Edited: 10:55 pm, March 17, 2020 "
