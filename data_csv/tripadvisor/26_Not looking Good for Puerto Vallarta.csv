"joleen...i was hoping at least you not to spread sensationalist headlines...maybe you'd like to read more recent news and level headed titles ...https://tribunadelabahia.com.mx/noticias/jalisco/vallarta-registra-10-casos-y-2-defunciones-por-covid-en-24-horas-36211 ...they are a long way from closing anything... there's two more weeks until schools start in mexico...after that, the low season starts until the winter."
"Alunelu - I have to agree with you. PVDN is known for sensationalizing some news stories and there may have been, but I did not see a date on that article. (In fairness, I didn't look very close.) Keep up the sharp eyes we need them now.I do appreciate Joleen attempting to keep us on top of every issue though. There are so many changes and it is such a matter of interest to us all."
"Well that article is dated July 26 so it’s pretty recent. Maybe that headline is a little sensationalized, but downplaying the seriousness doesn’t help either"
"The COVID19 situation is nothing to playdown. We all know it is very serious and we need to be aware. I believe that is what Joleen is helping with.On the other hand many journalists have a tendency to make it seem that the word will end tomorrow. We have all seen this behavior in the PVDN and other 'news papers'. It 'sells' copies. This hurts the over all effort in grasping exactly what is happening. I think this is what Alunelu is giving us. Personally, I think that we need people looking at all sides to help us get the best information. Feed it all to me and allow me to form my own opinion for my travels or the cancelation of my travels whichever I may decide is the correct thing for me. I appreciate all 3 inputs so far on this current thread."
"Here are some statistics that show Jalisco’s stats. At more than 12,000 cases and more than 1,300 deaths, it has been profoundly impacted by COVID. https:/…Elsewhere in Mexico, the cases/10,000 and death rates are even worse; the idea of shutting down Jalisco to non essential businesses again would be to keep Jalisco from falling further into that kind of crisis."
https://tribunadelabahia.com.mx/noticias/jal…this one is showing 10 cases yesterday...
"Alexandra...12k cases for a state with less than 9 million people that's nothing, considering how crowded everything is...quebec which is 8-9 times larger, had 60k cases and over 5k deaths...not to mention many european countries or most american states...so,please...nothing to discuss about in jalisco...just clickable bait...if anything, the governor should be complimented on how he managed the gradual opening of the tourist areas without causing a disaster like they did in so many places in the US.Edited: 9:49 pm, July 28, 2020 "
"i forgot to mention hawaii, they still haven't got a strategy to open the tourism safely, it seems that, like in politics, america is deeply divided, either too scared or too relaxed.maybe hawaii should look at vallarta for tips on how not to create another american local epidemic.Edited: 10:11 pm, July 28, 2020 "
For the latest stats (from Mexican govt sources) there is a good Wikipedia page that gets updated daily. This suggests the number of active cases in Jalisco is quite low relative to the rest of Mexico - Nayarit seems to statistically have a much bigger problem.https:/…COVID-19_pandemic_in_Mexico
Just so sad form the Mexican people.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g150793…
https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g150793…Well worth reading.
"Overall, from what I have read, its seems to me that there are many countries that are more heavily infected with the COVID19 than Mexico and that the states of Jalisco and Nayarit (when compared) are not nearly as badly infected as some other places in Mexico. The just as severe problems in Mexico are the areas that rely so heavily on the tourist dollar or provide product for those who sell to the tourists."
"#11 is about the Health Care Resources. A Must read.IMHOEdited: 3:16 pm, July 30, 2020 "
new info about the infections in jalisco and vallarta ... looks like they have plenty of space available in the hospitals ... https://tribunadelabahia.com.mx/noticias/jal…
"Yes, at least they say they do. Let's hope we don't need to find out. IMHO I don't PV much worse than anywhere else."
"{#8 - i forgot to mention hawaii, they still haven't got a strategy to open the tourism safely... maybe hawaii should look at vallarta for tips} Excuse me?? Oahu extended their quarantine. That IS their ""strategy"" for both resident and tourism safety. Perhaps the reverse is true though, Vallarta could have followed suit instead of remaining open with very little time for closure, little testing, no quarantines."
"suze...you're excused ...staying closed is not a strategy...they have growing cases without tourism...really smart!...the mexican states opened the tourism up to 30% occupancy, maybe hawaii should do something similar and add testing considering they have the money, unlike mexico..."
{they have growing cases without tourism...really smart!..}Their numbers would obviously be even higher if they were open to tourism. The quarantine is for residents as not only tourists. You don't know what you're talking about.
another example of how hawaii is doing it right ... https:/…
suzie...did i say anything about who the quarantine is for ?...stop putting words in my box!
"suzie...i know very well what i'm talking about as it affects me directly...i already cancelled 4 hawaii trips this summer because of the outdated 14 days quarantine rules in hawaii and canada....still waiting for the september and october trips...hope somebody starts thinking scientifically, not empirical."
"#7 I find your attitude regarding the pandemic in PV especially interesting since you were constantly warning people about Sayulita for months and months, even though you were not there. The MX government is under reporting cases of covid19. So for you to try and dismiss the seriousness of the virus in PV is disengenuous. Pam Thompson who is a medical professional in PV can give you much more realistic insight into what is actually happening.Edited: 1:25 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"what was happening in sayulita was a clear case of cover-up for which nobody was even fined for...not to mention how much abuse i have been exposed to...the covid-19 in jalisco is not covered-up...the numbers are posted daily , with public and private tests, the difference is that some people prefer the common mexican rhetoric of ...the government is corrupt, is a slave to the money, when in fact is just the people who decided to try and make it work with a less than favourable situation, instead of opening the doors wide open or closing them shut until...until when?...this virus will be with us for a few years and we have to start managing the situation somehow and staying home waiting for it to pass is not a viable solution."
"{staying home waiting for it to pass is not a viable solution}It is for some people. There's no reason I absolutely *need* to go to either Mexico or Hawaii. My vacations are not ""essential travel""."
"it's not only pleasure travel...a lot of travel is business or family related or some other reason that escapes me...travel has to open really soon, with strict rules, but has to open."
Luvthebeach..one more thing to clarify...i didn't have to be there to know that the infection was still going...the multiple reviews and posts from people visiting at the time were enough evidence...plus i have a few local friends who visit sayulita regularly...like every other week...and they were telling me witness reports on what was going on...
"Post #25 - ‘travel has to open really soon, with strict rules, but has to open.‘And why is that again, oh wise one?"
larry...i'm not going to waste my time enlightening the masses...read for yourself... you not so wise one...
"{family related or some other reason that escapes me}... is not ""essential travel"". Not by a long shot."
suzie...i'm ESL and you don't understand anything... i never said any of that travel is essential... stop putting words in my box...
"I am only saying ""family travel"" is the same as ""pleasure travel"". It is a choice. Neither are absolutely necessary in a pandemic."

"staff are Monitoring post lately, Some people should read Guidelines before they post.Alunelu !"
I personally don't feel that family travel and pleasure travel should be grouped under the same heading. My idea of some of family travel is traveling when it is due to travel to be with family in times of grief or stress or a very special event as well as to visit in good times. Pleasure travel is for good times and relaxation. JMO
"#26 To post about something you do not have first hand knowledge of is not helpful. We were also going every week to 10 days and what you were alleging was simply not true. Now you are, without one iota of credibility, suggesting that the numbers in PV are accurate - they are not. The government is under reporting and even given the seriousness of the numbers, the bars and restaurants are open with no social distancing or masks."
Luvthebeach...get out of the house sometimes...the fresh air is good for you.
"luvthebeach...vallarta just reported 7 new cases...you prefer to believe that the number of cases is intentionally reported low for what reason ?...you like conspiracy theories ?...what if the cases are 20,30 or 50 ?...are they hiding the dead in secret graves ?i have friends living there and the situation is exactly as the governor is saying...maybe some people who don't like him would like that the situation is worse, but look...two months with open beaches and restricted opening of the hotels didn't bring the doom and gloom that many of you have predicted. even more, nayarit has left the beaches open without much enforcement and the cases in bahia de banderas didn't get worse.where are you getting your info about crowded bars and restaurants without distancing? please post the link, i'm used to bs like this already."
"luvthebeach - you speak of Sayulita and compare it to COVID19 in Puerto Vallarta and much of Mexico. It is like attempting to compare the old adage of apples and oranges. With Sayulita many of us originally compared the Sayulita of pre 2010 with the severe out break that did occur and it took us some time to understand what was happening and at first our minds would just not accept it. We argued that the outbreak was not there as it had not been when we had been there in the past. We were wrong and had to accept that there was a severe problem.With COVID19 the whole world knows that it is real and that the virus continues to strike everywhere. There can be no cover up such as was in Sayulita. If I thought that there was a cover up in Puerto Vallarta I would be the first to take strong issue. I was at first fooled by the cover up in Sayulita and I defended a cover up. Once fooled is bad . Twice fooled is idiocy. I am sure some cases in Puerto Vallarta go unreported, but there are cases in every country and every city that go unreported."

https:/…Getting worse. So sad.
"Does anyone know if officials in Mexico make a distinction between those who die ""with"" Covid-19 and those who die ""from"" Covid-19?"
I'm not denying the existence of a problem. I'd like to know how Covid-19 deaths are counted in Mexico.
You post things you know nothing about. You vacation in PV while some of us live there.
"#38 I am NOT comparing the two at all. I am saying that Alunelu posts multiple comments about things that she has no first hand knowledge of. For months she posted about Sayulita without not being in Sayulita nor visiting it. She continually comments when she is basing her comments on things she's heard. That is not helpful regardless of the subject. And as I said, we live here ."
#44 https:/…
"I 'am hearing' from people in Mexico that the problems are more spotted than just the same across the general area. It seems that the people in Guadalajara are adhering much more to safety protocols than in some of the nearby smaller towns, where the People in Puerto Vallarta are not adhering to safety protocols as well as those in some of the smaller towns near by. I am sure that this is not just in Jalisco, but through out Mexico and also in the US, Canada and other countries throughout the world."
