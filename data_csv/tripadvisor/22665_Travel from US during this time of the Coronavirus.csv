I wanted to find out if anyone is aware or knows if you can travel to Columbia now with the current situation of the Coronavirus. I have a trip planned for March 21st with 1 week in Medellin. I have a few questions:Are they allowing tourists in Columbia now? Do you know if there’s a screening process? Are there any closures to tourist destinations?Any info would help and I can decide to cancel now if needed.Thanks in advance.
"If you are coming from the USA, my impression is that it will depend upon where you live and where you have been recently. If your residence is in a high risk area, e.g. the State of Washington or the cities of Austin or San Antonio or other high risk places like those, from what I read in another thread here, you might be denied entry to Colombia. Or, required to do a Quarantine, which I believe would be for 1 4 days.A few days ago, my wife told me that Avianca had, or was going to suspend the flights between Cali and Madrid. Now, I suspect they will also suspend flights from the UK to Colombia. That will not affect you Today she told me that the movie theaters have been ordered closed.There are apparently 6 cases of the COVID-19 here now and we would like to keep that number as low as is possible.I wish that I had a link that would give you up to date information but I don't."
"As long as you are a United States Citizen, there should not be any issue, per the following link:https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/noticia…However, if you have permanent residency in the United States, in other words a foreign European or Asian passport, you will probably be denied entry as of this coming Monday. A permanent residency card does not mean anything to foreign officials, as they will scan and examine your passport... If your passport is from Europe or Asia, you might have to do some major convincing of your permanent residency status in the USA. And barring any success, subject to quarantine. A green card still means your legal nationality is a foreign country, subject to the ban.I am planning on going to Colombia on Monday. I should not have a problem, but will let you all know if I do."
Thanks for your help. This information is very helpful.
Wow! Thanks. The link really helps. We are so looking forward to our trip. If you could update me then that would be great. We are flying in next Saturday.
Wow! Thx. Looking forward to the follow up
"I will do. I flying from SFO to Panama to Bogota. I filled out the online health form (which you need to do by the way before you fly out). I am not to worried. Despite posts of people being denied entry from the United States, I suspect that it is because of the passport they provided. As you know, there are many foreign Asian or European workers here on work visas and they won’t be able to go to Colombia. As long as you have a blue USA passport, I imagine you will be okay... I arrive at 11:45 AM. I will update you all on the process. I expect craziness since I know that many people whose nationalities from Asia / Europe are not even permitted to even enter the country, quarantine or not."
flew in on Thursday from the US to Bogota! Just had to do the health screening and they checked our temperature before immigration. We've been fine as of now!!
Last question: Where do I find the online health screen? Is it on the link you provided in the previous post?
"Where is the medical check done? I have flown into Bogota a gazillion times and even before CV, there is a lot of chaos in the immigration line? Did you stand in line for foreigners and once you go up to immigration, they led you to medical? I hope it goes smooth... just mentally preparing for it."
"Roberto,Here you go:https:/…controlpreventivocontraelcoronavirusIf you understand Spanish, the Spanish site is much better. I found the English site very confusing."
Thanks again
"To summarize what I posted in a Thread for Cartagena. I believe this is true:Beginning tonight (at Midnight?) THE ONLY people who will be admitted to Colombia are:Colombian Citizens WHO LIVE IN COLOMBIAandAliens WHO LIVE IN COLOMBIA legally. For example, my Cedula says ""Residente"".Possibly others will be admitted and subject to a quarantine and if they violate that, they will be subject to jail/prison and high monetary fines.https://www.elespectador.com/coronavirus/gob…"
"We are in Medellin now - We are US Citizens- just got this update. This was sent from Medellinguru.comReader Alert: Coronavirus in ColombiaColombia temporarily bans the entry of all foreign visitors traveling to ColombiaCoronavirus in Colombia: Myth vs Reality – Is It Safe to Travel? Coronavirus in Colombia: is it safe to travel to Colombia or in Colombia? We look at statistics and measures in Colombia to minimize the threat of COVID-19. President Iván Duque announced on Sunday, March 15, that no foreigner, except those with residence, will be allowed to enter Colombia as of Monday, March 16, as part of the expansion of measures to control the expansion of the coronavirus. In addition, Colombia has put in place many measures to minimize the public health threats posed by coronavirus. Colombia has closed its border with Venezuela, suspended the transit of cruise ships through Colombia and canceled all events larger than 500 people. Colombia Minsalud reported the number of coronavirus cases in Colombia on March 15 was a total of 34 cases with no deaths. Colombia is closing its border faster than other countries have done to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. It remains to be seen how effective these measures will be in Colombia. This is significant news that may impact many readers. Medellin Guru has never sent a Reader Alert before but we feel this is important news that readers will want to know about as soon as possibleEdited: 5:30 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"FWIW, I'm an Australian citizen travelling in Colombia. I flew in yesterday (March 16th) into Bogota without any issues. Then flew on to Cartagena and spent a night there.I flew into Medellin today, and our hotel did not let us check in. Or rather, they would only let us stay in the hotel if we agreed to a 14 day quarantine. Their reasoning is that this is the new rule imposed by the immigration officials. I tried to argue that the restrictions were only in place for people travelling from places like China, Italy etc, but they would not budge.The lady at the hotel was apologetic, but tried to call other hotels to see who would let us in - no one would. We ended up booking an airbnb for the night, yet to check in and see if they allow us to stay. In the meantime, we're frantically trying to change our flights and head back to Australia asap."
"RE: Reply #14You wrote "". I tried to argue that the restrictions were only in place for people travelling from places like China, Italy etc, but they would not budge.""In this case, she was correct. She did not want to risk going to jail or prison or paying a humongous fine.My wife believes that our daughter cannot come to visit us during this emergency (she is in the USA) because if she came here, she would need to do the 14 day quarantine. She's a dual citizen, Colombia and USA.I hope your trip is a safe one."
"The ruling is for every foreigner and Colombian from today, no matter where from - you have 14 days quarantine."
"By the way, you went to a BnB, but the rule still applies. Police have been checking foreigners around Poblado and other tourist places today ( random stops ) and you risk deportation and a ban for 7 years."
"This was sent to the hotels apparently, which states that anyone arriving from the 3rd March needs to isolate. I cannot see this on the Migration website ( or any others) so wrote to them on FB. I will post here what ( if) they reply.Buenas tardes,El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y otras instituciones del Estado en la formulación e implementación de la Política Migratoria han anunciado a los hoteles en Colombia que aislaran como medida preventiva a los visitantes extranjeros que llegaron desde el 3 de marzo a la fecha hasta nuevo aviso. En caso de no cumplir con las instrucciones, puede ser expulsado del país por violar los protocolos de aislamiento. Por tal motivo quedan suspendidos los servicios turísticos y de transporte hasta nuevo comunicado. Cordialmente.Departamento de Concierge"
"Please choose another month to travel, this is not a good time."
"Like others state, better that you would visit another time as it is getting real here in Colombia.I just returned from a road trip with my mother and sister from LA, 7 day and 1,100 km driving trip from Medellin - Jardin - Jerico - Salento - Armenia - Honda - Dordal (Hacienda Napoles) - Medellin and last night in Doradal the hotels would not allow my mum and sis to stay as they entered Colombia/Medellin 10 days ago.Now back in my apartment in Medellin and not sure if I can take a few day trips with them in tow to Guatape and Santa fe de Antiouqia, for example.They are scheduled to return to LAX in one week but everything is fluid situation.Stay home.Edited: 10:50 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Just curious.Does anyone know how long the border closure is for?
"@ Roberto M - How long? My guess is until the threat subsides.Edited: 9:39 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"It's really a dangerous situation. I'm scared and not going out for anything. I missing lots of street foods but can't go. Most of the time, I'm playing with my kids with Nerf guns and it's fun. Got one after checking this- https:/…"
"RE: Reply #21The general quarantine is scheduled to expire on 27 April 2020 if my memory is correct. Also, I believe that Colombia will begin to permit DOMESTIC flights on or about 27 April 2020.HOWEVER, the ban on International flights to/from Colombia has been extended. I believe there was a new decree on 15 April 2020, but that the date that International flights can resume has not yet been determined, because they are working on the regulations that will apply. For example, I believe they will prohibit people sitting in the Middle seats in the Coach cabin of the aircraft. There will also be other regulations. The question today (17 April 2020) is whether the flights will be permitted to begin operation, for example, early in May 2020 or if it will be June or afterETA: Tourist things are closed at this time. This is NOT a good time for Foreign Tourists to be in Colombia.Edited: 8:02 am, April 17, 2020 "
My suggestion for those who want to visit as a tourist - wait until 2021
"Or 2022, seems almost unreal to say such a thing but we, nobody does, just does not know."
"I am hopeful to be able to make a return visit to Medellin by July or August this year.It all depends on the situation in Medellin--not just whether they are allowing visits by foreigners.1. Will restaurants be open for in dining experiences?...will it be safe?2. Will gyms be open?3. As an American will economic fallout make it less safe out and about (especially at night) than it has been in the past (no problems, previously)If not this summer, then I would be hopeful to visit in December or January with the same questions above still relevant.It is possible this next visit could be a 2 week visit with the intent of seeing if this is a place I could live for 3 months, 6 months, or longer. Right now it is too early to tell and I need to see how healthy, safe, and what changes will be in effect."
"I think December /Janiary time fram is more realistic - 3rd quarter in Colombia - I would expect lots of places to be closed - limited restuarants - no clubs , no large gatherings -"
"This pandemic has ruined all my travel planning for 2020. I had lots of plans to visit at least 8 countries this year but it's not possible anymore. Rather, I spending my time with family and kids. Every morning we swim in the pool (recently got one above ground pool, i.e.- Summer Waves Elite ). It's also great fun but I still missing to explore new places."
I know the feeling!
