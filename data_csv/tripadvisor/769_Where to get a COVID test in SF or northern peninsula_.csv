I need to fly to San Francisco to visit an immunocompromised family member. After quarantining for 2 weeks I'll need to take a COVID test before I can visit. I've searched online but it seems that most of the testing facilities either require a doctor's referral or you need to be showing symptoms. Is there somewhere in SF or the northern peninsula where I can be tested?

You can get a doctor's referral if needed by doing a virtual appointment via video or phone. You will likely qualify to get a test. I assume you have insurance.
Project Baseline does not need a doctor but takes much longer for results. Can be a week:https:/…study-locations

Response to chinita415 I do not have insurance in the US so would be paying cash for the test.
"Please, this is a stressful time for me. i know how to use google and search for links but I really only need information from those who know where I can be tested without a doctor's referral or having symptoms. I do not have insurance in the US. If you do not know where I can be tested, please do not respond"
"I am a healthcare provider and these links are not from Google but from my colleagues in the Bay Area. Project Baseline is free if you don't have insurance. For the ones affiliated with urgent care, probably looking at about $200. Project Baseline appointments are readily available but as I said results can take 5 to 7 business days. So pay with money or time."
Testing guidelines at each institution is changing by the day or even hour. Kaiser has not been testing asymptomatic people due to capacity. My institution is testing. You have to do some homework by calling each site yourself. And the guidelines may be different when you are here as I said because they are constantly changing.
"I know people who have done the home self collect kit via LabCorp. 2nd link above. I did a dummy request and you don't need to have symptoms or need a doctor referral. $119 cash pay. May be your best option. Turnaround time as least the past few weeks were quick.Edited: 8:40 pm, August 14, 2020 "
thank you
"Good luck Melanie. My husband spent many springs in Guanacaste for his graduate field research. He was in the tiny town of Bagaces near Liberia.Edited: 11:13 pm, August 14, 2020 "
"I know of 2, Chinese hospital in Chinatown and Stanford. By appointment only, get in early morning, result by evening, $200-$600 per test."
"You'll want to get travelers medical insurance before entering the U.S. You don't want to take the chance that you could contract Covid while traveling and not have insurance, treatment costs here could be enormous. www.visitorscoverage.comwww.sevencorners.com"
