"HiI have a connection at Suvarnabhumi, coming from an international flight. I have got 4 hours between the scheduled arrival of the incoming flight and the scheduled departure of the second flight, which is with a different airline so they won't wait if I am late. Was wondering if immigration is a lengthy process and if there are any medical checks at the moment which may delay this further. I will also have luggage to collect. Will 4 hours be enough assuming the first flight arrives on time?Many thanks"
Yes 4 hours is enough
"Thanks, do they actually do any medical checks for coronavirus?"
