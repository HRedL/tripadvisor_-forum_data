Anyone heard of any coronavirus cases in Negril or at the airport?!
Please read the many threads already started on this subject.
"As of this minute (and that can change quickly), Jamaica has no reported cases of Coronavirus.."
I read there was a case in Manchester hospitalPEACE!
Have you seen any reported on the news or in local papers? No? Then your answer is no. You can’t trust talk around here... Jcans love to talk and live to spread the gossip.
"Even if there actually were infected people chances are they wouldn't be diagnosed properly. Its highly doubtful Jamaican hospitals/clinics have a legit supply of test kits. Even the US has a limited supply and isn't testing all the time. I know this for a fact because my children had fever/sickness, my son went to the e.r. due to his temperature. Diagnosed with flu. No Corona test."
"#5 was your given a flu test? I’d not, why? If my child presented with those symptoms I’d ask for a flu test. My daughter was extremely ill in January. We thought dengue. Dengue test was negative. Dr said flu. I said based on what? Do the flu test. He kinda raised his brows but did it anyway.. it was influenza A. She was in her bed a full two weeks and coughed like mad foranother two weeks.Edited: 8:48 am, March 05, 2020 "
"No tests at all. The CDC was not authorizing the Coronavirus tests yet either. Treated with fluids and released. Told to follow up with the pediatrician the next Monday. I wonder how many cases would have been positive for the Cor virus had they actually started testing earlier. Instead all we hear about are ""new"" cases in the US now. The truth is they just started testing for it. The virus might have already been circulating for months.Edited: 7:44 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Well, first - that's the US and the fact that the US Government wasn't taking this seriously, the CDC funds were cut last year and the first tests they made failed...this is why just now, weeks after this hit the news, months after learning about the outbreak in China the CDC is FIRST getting test kits out and even so, not nearly enough. With 11 dead in the US to me this is too little too late.The rest of the world is a completely different story. The WHO (World Health Organization) has been distributing test kits from early on. This is why a place like South Korea can test 10,000 people while testing in the US is limited to a couple of hundred. Does Jamaia have testing kits? I truly have no idea but with WHO handling things my guess is that they probably do.Thankfully the rest of the world does not have to deal with US incompetence."
"Angelini, it's not far fetched to assume the virus came to America in January. With all the holiday travel from China and the region, I wouldnt be shocked if if its been here for a good month or longer. Honestly Im surprised, with all the Chinese workers in Jamaica, that there hasn't been any reported cases. I'm going 3/15 and have my fingers crossed. Alot can happen in the next week."
"Typical californian...blaming U.S. incompetence for something that came out of Chinese wet markets. The U.S. has its issues but we are 5% of the worlds population but research, develop and manufacture the majority of the worlds new life saving drugs. If it wasn't for U.S. competence and subsidizing the rest of the planet there would be millions upon millions of people the world over dying from all sorts of diseases. How many HIV drugs are developed in Jamaica and given for free to millions of poor people the world over? Sorry for the rant but this stuff drives me crazy."
January?? Try October of last year. There are some people here in the island in quarantine... some at home and some in a facility. MOH posted it on Facebook yesterday. Still not concerned.
"George, yes the blame falls squarely on China. America's response is no worse than any other Country. As far as the 11 dead, almost all were in one nursing home or cruise ship. Tragic, but like other bad flues and viruses, this will pass."
"Actually, if you read the WHO summary, the US response has been more lax than others. And RG's comments are by and large accurate re: funding cuts, bad test kits, and far too few test kits (compared to some other affected nations). Apologies for topic drift. Onward."
"Sorry I have to respond to this:""Typical californian..""I'm actually born and raised in New York. Starting your ""rant"" off with a generalization such as this makes the rest of the rant not credible...but..."".blaming U.S. incompetence for something that came out of Chinese wet markets.""While the virus ""originated"" in China, and China being China of course got it to where it is what I'm talking about is the US response to it - which was ""stick the head in the sand, blah-blah-blah I can't hear you, typical oof this administration. The fact is that CDC funds were cut last year, the existing PanDemic task force in place since 2014 was disbanded and everyone was caught with their pants down when this inevitably hit our shores. Dealing with it by keeping thousands of people prisoner on a cruise ship IS NOT the way to deal....the fact that here we are a good 2 months later FIRST getting adequate amounts of test kits out into the public is shameful beyond belief. That's MY problem with the US...no sense in raging about China when this thing is out and about and government is so unprepared. I'll repeat those 11 deaths might have been prevented had we been more prepared.""The U.S. has its issues but we are 5% of the worlds population but research, develop and manufacture the majority of the worlds new life saving drugs. If it wasn't for U.S. competence and subsidizing the rest of the planet there would be millions upon millions of people the world over dying from all sorts of diseases."" The US does not hold a monopoly on life saving drugs. We lag in cancer research. We willfully lagged in HIV research."""" How many HIV drugs are developed in Jamaica and given for free to millions of poor people the world over? "" Free drugs? From the US Healthcare system that is so broken people die every day from mere neglect? Oh and by the way the biggest breakthrough in HIV research was done in FRANCE where they developed a test to detect the virus. The US went to battle with the French over the patent - and lost.As for Jamaica, I feel they are way more prepared to deal with this than we are in the US. Either way - wash your dang hands....over, and over and over. I fly next week."
"TripAdvisor is supposed to be for travelers to engage in Q&A about a destination ....so sick of so many sharing their political opinions,sarcasm,rude biases, etc, please go offline or enjoy Facebook where you can be blocked by people you think are friends! Safe travels :)"
A man died last nite north manchester general
"Again, I am going to point out that more people have died in car accidents. And the flu has killed way more people. THE CDC and WHO have said that the most vulnerable to Coronavirus are the elderly, the very young and people that already have underlying issues or compromised immune systems. If you are healthy, take precautions you will be fine. And that there will be people that test positive but never, ever show any symptoms."
"Stephanie B, which hospital in the Jamaican Parish of Manchester did this death occur?"
"blondie9093,Car accidents are caused by a virus?The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 percent of those that catch the flu.The mortality rate for coronavirus is approaching 4 percent of those that are infected with that virus."

First case of COVID-19 in Jamaica. jamaicaninsider.com/coronavirus-covid-19-is-…
"Great... My vacation plans are now canceled as Jamaica put a ban in place for tourists from Germany. April 20 - we already prebooked everythingEdited: 6:38 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Tourists from Germany are banned??
"From the article above:""The Minister has also announced that France,Germany and Spain have been added to a list countries where travel restrictions have been placed on by the Jamaican government."""
"Yes our ministry of foreign affairs also announced today that nobody will be allowed to enter Jamaica who has been in Spain, France or Germany in the past 14 days so we are very sad now as I have been dreaming about Jamaica for a long timeEdited: 7:48 pm, March 10, 2020 "
I feel your pain. I spent the last 1.5 years planning our trip and just had to cancel our trip too. It’s so disappointing but better safe than sorry. Be well!
"Thank you Pizzagal, I agree with you! Who knows maybe it is for the better to stay home yet. I hope we both can come to Jamaica one day :)Edited: 7:54 pm, March 10, 2020 "
You are so right.
"Save your breath. If discussing Covid-19 with someone who is using the ""talking points"" from you know who, you are talking with someone who gets their world news from you know where. Those of us outside that sphere are much more aware or what is to come and the difference between .1 and 3.5.Covid 19 can be dealt with but not when you deny it's existence. It reminds me of the meme..""there can't be a Covid 19 crisis if we don't test anyone."""
We are scheduled to leave Sunday morning from Minneapolis. Wondering if safe to travel or better to stay home?? Mostly worried about not being able to return home.
We have the same question and could we end up in a self quarantine situation when we get back home. It seems like a gamble.
"Typical californian...blaming U.S. incompetence for something that came out of Chinese wet markets. AMEN to that... It is amazing how many people panic when a crisis unfolds. When manufacturing of a great many products are done overseas and there is a world wide pandemic, guess what there are shortages..... When the U.S placed travel restrictions on China the president was called a xenophobe and an isolationist. Just came back from Jamaica 1 week ago and to be honest, In hindsight, I would err on the side of caution and place vacation plans on hold for the time being. Not worth spreading this and taking out someones grandma or grandpa."
"Hi. We’re a family of 4 with plans to leave Sunday morning as well, from MSP. Stressing out. We want to go. Have you made a decision yet?"
"""Mostly worried about not being able to return home.""As a US Citizen you can't be held in a country against your will. The only reason you might face a quarantine in Jamaica is if you fail the temp test at the airport. Even then, you have the right to go home. You just won't be able to leave the airport in Jamaica.Keep tabs on your health and if you are feeling symptomatic try to get tested and don't go if you are sick. Airlines are waiving change fees indefinitely."
"well here is Canada's Advisory for today....Official Global Travel AdvisoryAvoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.To limit the spread of COVID-19, many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Airlines have cancelled flights. New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans may be severely disrupted and you may be forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected.Contact your airline or tour operator to determine options for cancelling or postponing your trip.If you are still considering travelling:Check your destination’s Safety and security, Entry/exit requirements and Health sections.Get the Government of Canada’s latest updates on COVID-19.If you are outside of Canada:Find out what commercial options are still available to return to Canada. Consider returning to Canada earlier than planned if these options are becoming more limited.Ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are disrupted.This advisory overrides all other risk levels, with the exception of areas for which we advise to avoid all travel (including regional advisories). The avoid all travel advisories remain valid."
"6 cases confirmed (official news).There are cases in Kingston and in Negril...(a friend told me). Masks and disinfectants begin to run out in Negril.People don't use precautions and are crammed into stores.Still people don't realize the danger.Think about your health and that of your loved ones!Think about the situation of hospitals there!Edited: 3:41 am, March 14, 2020 "
"#37. 8 cases. We have 8 cases. Trust me, people are aware of what’s going on... you don’t want to sneeze in public around here."
Sadly we have cancelled. We visit when this all settles down
"Anyone who has cancelled or rescheduled has made the BEST decision, not only for them and their families but the citizens and other world travelers to Jamaica. It is not going away any time soon and we are all advised to stay away from crowds and practice ""social distancing"". Poor Jamaica is going to see far more cases in upcoming days by people hell bend on having their vacation.Jamaica will always be there. Do the responsible thing and stay home."
We had plans to travel there on March 29th. We have canceled until us it safer for everyone
"In addition to other countries, Jamaica has now banned flights from UK . I was booked to fly out on the 31st but that isn't happening but vouchers valid for 1 year are being offered by British Airways to their customers. However my hotel booking was booked with Tui and looks like any possible hotel refunds should be requested via insurance if you have insurance......."
"With the entire world grinding to a halt, why would you go on an unnecessary leisure trip at the risk of spreading the disease to others if you should happen to catch it, or even to your own family. I know it’s inconvenient and disruptive to your family plans but this is a much bigger issue on a global scale. The airlines are offering full rescheduling and refunds. Going right now is selfish, narcissistic and without regard to human health and safety... If you have to even ask the question, you know the answer...Be safe"
well said
Two cases in Jamaica as of March 14th.Both are travellers from the UK.The affected are in Kingston.
Yesterday 15.
You can be certain there are a lot more cases. Testing is just getting started. Stay away.
#46 12 not 15. There are 12 cases on the island.
"Again. There are twelve ""verified"", or confirmed positive tests. There are certainly many more infected. How many tests has Jamaica performed?"
15 cases now. There will be more.
"im a jamaican reading this. I work in negril jamaica. I live in hanover, there are no cases of corona in Westmoreland or hanover currently. That can change, however we will be suffering from all the damn cancellations of holidays as a result of this coronavirus. safety first yes, but the economic fallout for us is terrible. Did you make it to jamaica on the 15th ? are you currently here or did you cancel as well? we are doing our best with what we have to contain this damn thing. The timing is so damn horrible for all of this in our busy tourist season"
We have 12 cases on the island not 15
"There will be economic fallout for 99% of folks, islandconcierge. I realize it's harder on people reliant on tourism, but what do you do? Bury your head in the sand and tell people it's fine, knowing that it's just a ticking time bomb? That would be the absolute worst thing to do, because the economy is still going to crash, and harder. You have to rely on public health professionals. Otherwise you're just guessing, and most likely making the situation far worse for everyone. It is what it is at this point, we all have to suck it up and deal with it in our own way. Iriestar, you know damn well there are more than 15 people infected on Jamaica. Kinda tough to identify them without testing. Even here stateside, I can't go get a test even if I had symptoms. Failures all around. Let's not add to it by acting like it isn't a problem."
"Irestar,I am confused. I can appreciate wanting to be factually correct, however, I wonder....what difference does it make if it is 12 or 15 or 112 or 1112?Facts are that it is on the island, it is here in the US...it seems to be everywhere. IMHO, we should all cease to travel until we start beating this thing into submission. I agree that the testing has been a complete failure. Not sure what the exact US #'s are today, but I wholeheartedly agree that the numbers are probably much, much higher than are being reported. islandconcierge, my heart and my prayers are with you and the beautiful island you live on. Everyone stay safe."
"Islandconcierge - it is heartbreaking to advise someone to cancel their vacation. Your government is moving forward with measure that in the end hopefully will stave off this disease as much as possible (bars and restaurants closing on Wednesday for example). Knowing what I do about the Jamaican economy, knowing many who work in the tourism sector there I can't even wrap my head around the economic fallout about to happen.What brought me around was talking to friends in Negril and realizing that your medical system will already be stretched to the max with cases of COVID as they come up. Visitors who get sick, or worse bring sick to the country will flatten that already fragile system.I too am taking a serious economic hit here in the US because of the virus. We are all in this together, the whole world. I pray this makes us a closer global community, a more sympathetic and understanding human race.Blessings to you and yours."
"Even if they get a mild case of covid-19 my Jamaican friends are worried about being able to afford cough syrup and over-the-counter flu meds, let alone a trip to the hospital. We don't want to add more fuel to the fire."
"IslandConcierge,Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Those of us who love Jamaica as visitors appreciate how awful this will be for you if we stay home, even though we must. Certainly the hardship will be way worse on Jamaica and Jamaicans relative to the US, though most of us will take some kind of hit. Of course, there are far more cases in all areas of your country and mine than the known daily counts. Please know that many of us who cannot travel now will find other ways to help financially as best we can. One love."
"Officially cancelling my trip for the end of April today.....sad but needs to be done. My wife is a small business owner and we she was shut down by the state last night indefinitely. There will always be other times for a tropical vacation but once this passes (and it will) there are going to be thousands of restaurants, salons, massage therapists, barbers, small hotels and inns, shops etc in your local communities in your home country that are going to need your support. For the foreseeable all of my discretionary income will be going to help my local community, state and country. I feel for the people of Jamaica as much as anyone during this time but supporting your local communities when this is over is going to be much more important than spending that money in a foreign country. Many thousands of your local businesses will close forever and the ones that make it through will need your helpEdited: 7:21 am, March 18, 2020 "
"#54 because it does matter. At a time like this the facts should be posted, not assumptions or speculations. It was in no way to offend you, but just to clarify. And we are now at 13."
"Timmy: I don’t damn well know there’s more than 15... it’s been announced, as of yesterday, that’s theres 13. Could be more, I haven’t watched or read the news this morning."
"Couldn’t edit: are there more then 13? Probably. But when you’re talking about confirmed cases at least be accurate. I know if anyone in my house starts having symptoms, we won’t be going to the dr or the hospital. No need to... we’re healthy and have no under lying health issues and are fully stocked with meds. Cough syrup here is cheap.. less than $500 a bottle.. you can find it for $300 all over the island.the Chinese (Not Jamaican Chinese) have closed up their shops and restaurants and are laying low... very very low."
"You do realize that even young healthy individuals are at risk of permanent damage to respiratory function as a result of having this disease? And by not seeking medical attention, you are putting everyone around them at risk of transmission and furry her spread. No offence but I find this to be a reckless and irresponsible approach to the situation."
"Stats say only 10% of those infected need to go to the hospital. Things are obviously very fluid in the US with stats and testing. 80% of those infected dont know they ever had it or very minor issues. Everyone isnt going to be able to go to the ER. The hospitals would be overrun and not be able to treat patients who can be cured. Even more so in Jamaica.With that being said, the virus is deadly and does cause permanent damage to some. If get it, I will isolate, fight it, and very quickly follow instructions to those who feel they need critical care. I will make that decision very quick.Edited: 10:56 am, March 18, 2020 "
"What is needed in most countries is a testing methodology that is effective, usable and rapid response. Right now, in the US, it's a bit chaotic. Nothing as organized as it is in South Korea and Singapore. Hopefully, it'll get resolved soon as it is an important step in identification and containment strategies.Edited: 11:07 am, March 18, 2020 "
"In Italy we passed from 16 cases on 22th February to 28.710 cases now (35.713 in total, deaths 2.978, healed 4.025). And this in less than a month!Precision?You can know this on official site and channels.A virus knows no boundaries!In two/three days cases double.The epidemiological curves are the same! We try to push the peak away and intensive care in hospitals is at risk of being out of bed (10% needs pulmonary respirators, 40% needs stays in the hospitals).Doctors hope...to have enought beds for alls (coronavirus and other sick people).Economics impacts there will be...there are...but our life and our health are more impotant than a holiday. Don’t you believe?Think about this!I send this to safe at least one life..."
"I live in Las Vegas. Our tourism and convention business relies on visitors from all over the country and the world. All casinos, hotels, restaurants, bars and all non-essential businesses are now closed. Our city and the entire state is pretty much on lockdown now for At least 30 days. Yes, this is going to be devastating to our economy, but 30 days is the price we must pay to save countless lives. We’re trying to learn from what’s happened and continues to happen in Italy. Sadly, my 86 year old husband and I (72 yrs. old) have to cancel our much anticipated trip to Jamaica - Couples Tower Isle. We’re very sad about it but we also know it’s the right thing to Hopefully we’ll be able to reschedule when this is over ... but supporting and helping to rebuild our local economy will be our first priority. Prayers for all of us... all over the world, we’re in this together and WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS!"
We just got back. When we first arrived there was one case and when we left there were at least 11 and one death. They will be closing soon due to the virus. We did still have a great time.
"When we went to Negril on 3/19 there was one case reported in Kingston from someone with duel citizenship that came from the UK. There were no cases reported in Negril. Leaving Midway Airport in Chicago the only question was if we had been to China. That was the only question we got when we entered Jamaica. No masks, no temperature check entering or leaving. The same when we came back through customs at Midway. No masks, no temperature checks, nothing. It was a ghost town. It is obvious governments have put greed and money above health and safety. Ours here is the worst. Having information as early as January from information received from security agencies and the Global Health Security Team, no, our first line of defense was disbanded by this administration. Having not listened to the scientific community and a total response of hunches and misinformation that continues to spew from this administration and Fox news this won't go away soon till they do. Vote them out and listen to other news sources that tell the whole truth."
"Well,l as a Jamaican living outside Jamaica for well over 45 years I can only speak of the little I see from my twice yearly visits as a tourist. The base of the Jamaican economy has shifted to a service driven state. There are many arguments around that but this is not the time or place, the issue is the effects on lives. As I speak with friends on the Island I hear one voice that of lost income. It's apparent no one in Jamaica does backyard farming as in the pass, this will make it even more difficult for some. When I ask why the reply 'old time something that' In these times maybe it would have helped rather than hoping people risk lives to travel under suspect conditions. After this storm I am sure things will be forgotten and back to usual we will be, waiting for the next storm. Lets hope for a swift recovery."
@#69I see you only have 1 post. You do realize this IS NOT a political forum. Spew your hate somewhere else.
"#69 - I am with you 100% but #71 is not wrong - this is a travel forum. However...it's hard to separate the two when we are discussing travel issues related to this virus and individual governments' responses to them.Right after you arrived (3/19? Pretty much in the middle of the mess but whatever...) Jamaica did implement heat sensors/temperature taking. Shortly after that, they started a mandatory 2 week quarantine to hotel rooms for incoming people (visitors and residents). At around the same time they closed the bars and restaurants except for delivery/take out. In the past week many hotels in Negril have closed. Residents (and remaining tourists) are instructed to ""shelter in place"".Meantime....my brother in law returned from Thailand last week. He passed through customs and immigration here in the US like it was any other day - barely looked at, ""normal"" questions at immigration, not even a raised eyebrow that he had just spent 2 months in Asia....no masks...no gloves.People are in denial. Half the time they don't realize their actions are selfish (the beaches in my area were PACKED this weekend despite a state-wide shelter in place ORDER). Government's can't cure stupid or selfish. It is up to us, each individual to practice common sense.....""social distancing"", washing hands and most importantly - stay at home (if you can). Your state or government might not be ordering this but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do the right thing."
It isn't political to point out when someone is blatantly lying. These are easily verifiable things.
"I assume you’re referring to Trump and your response is ridiculous. You’re probably one that would blame him for the weather. If he hadn’t cut off travel from China when he did in January our situation would be a lot lot worse. People are dying and you’re bringing your political bias into it. That is sick..Edited: 4:18 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"RG was right, above; this absolutely isn't the place for this. I'm not taking the bait, but I will say this:Look outside of one single source for your ""news"", ffs, and get off of facebook."
Totally agree. Not the place.

"Sorry one more thing. Not political I promise. We are planning on visiting family in June but are monitoring events by the moment. They’ve shutdowns down my husband’s hotel in Negril West End but one room is refusing to leave, crazy. He’s downplaying everything by saying the 19 or so cases are in Kingston. I personally don’t think it should be downplayed. My family is still having parties there and people are still congregating. Again, not condoning that. Crazy times and I hope everyone stays safe.Edited: 8:55 pm, March 23, 2020 "
please post the name of your husband's hotel. thank you.
Westender Inn.
"The US CDC would not approve the test that was used overseas, they had to develop their own test.... which didn’t work. After losing a month of valuable time they finally approved a variety of tests. The sad part is that some of the tests used overseas, are made in the US but were it approved for use here"
Thanks for reminding me not to visit that hotel
Glad I could help.
"Yeah we'll definitely not stay there again, for a few reasons."
Oh geez we’re so upset
"I know the owner at Westender, he's a really nice guy and the place is very chill. I live south of there deep west and my friends and I go there often for drinks.That said, it is disappointing to hear that they are ""still having parties"" but unclear who is attending the parties? Staff? Family? Friends in Negril tell me pretty much every tourist is gone and those like me that spend months there are starting to leave as well, short of their original departure dates.As for the the one ""refusing"" to leave...well, the police can remove them and will remove them if management asks them to. A few people still ""stuck"" on-island until their flights arrive are staying in various small guest houses or even people's homes - some of the bigger and better known hotels in Negril have closed as well.As far as your vacation in June, I'd say its a ""wait and see"" situation. Anyone with plans in May I'd say cancel...but you probably have another month to make that decision.We are all in this together."
No no. That’s now what I meant. My family lives in Orange Hill and had a birthday party. Westender is shuttling down but some guests are refusing to leave.
"Oh! Lol.....well, the beat goes on especially in Orange Hill. Guest guestS? Refusing to leave, how can anyone do that? I'd get the police involved."
Yeah my family thinks they’re immune lol.
I feel ya BethAnn - so do the hundreds of people gathering on the beaches of the Sonoma Coast this past weekend. Because of them those beaches are closed now.
""" Just really smart:) ""Too bad your family isn't..,lol"
Agreed!
"Friends of mine that work at Idle Awhile in Negril have been furloughed for at least two months as all three properties are closed. For those of you who know the staff there know they are wonderful people. Sadly Idlewhile fired both Aaron and Jenny so they will not be back. Very, very sad news. I’ve known these people for many years and I feel so badly for them and all those who face an uncertain future.Edited: 9:29 am, March 26, 2020 "
That’s horrible and I fear this is going to be widespread across a lot of the boutique hotels as those are hardest hit. I’ve stayed at both hide awhile and idle awhile and loved both properties.
This is horribly sad news and so very sorry to hear this. Let’s hope and pray for an end to this. Can’t imagine what they are going thru. Hopefully we will see them again.
"""Idlewhile fired both Aaron and Jenny""This really shocked me...I will keep my eyes open for more info on this prior to reserving 2021."
Left Negril two weeks ago been listening to HEAVY HEAVY ROOTS/Dub to get through all of this for hours on end. Anyone else listening to roots during these times ?
"Nah - I listen to earlier less commercial Jamaican music like calypso, sk(y)a and mento. Currently listening to Lord Creator's version of the Big Bamboo. Coxsone Dodd's records are wonderful."
"I listen to everything....""when you get confused listen to the music play...""."

Aaron was the very best life guard beach attendant that we have ever encounteredLiterally blows my mind that IA has fired himWould love to know the back storyAnd Jenny was always all smilesIs Needle (Carlton) next?
"to-Islandconcierge -My heart goes out to Jamaica, we have vacationed there since 1993.Spent Jan19-Feb16 at Riu Trop Bay and am worried sick over what staff is facing.What can we do to help? We are on"" lockdown ""here near Chicago. - Thanks for any ideas to help the people."
"So many people are out of hospitality jobs. Some hotels/resorts are doing their best to take care of their people. Some just shut the doors and that’s that. The thing I don’t understand is why not lay them off? It makes better business sense. Here in Jamaica, when you fire someone, you have to pay them a severance package. No exceptions. There had to be more to the story. The reason i can see them doing a mass firing is to rehire hit at a lower pay rate because they know people will be desperate for work. We don’t have unemployment here or any kind of safety net for our citizens. I say to visitors, watch those businesses that did their best by their people and support them when this pandemic is over."
"Irestar, have their been any reports of the virus in Westmoreland or Hanover? I've not seen any reports. Some comments from the owner of the Charela inn in Negril on how he will try to help his employees. They are good people at Charela. https://hospitalityjamaica.com/news1.html"
"There are cases in both Westmoreland and Hanover.Many hotels and resorts are doing what they can to help their laid off employees. Not surprised Mr. Grizzle from Charela is one of them, he is a good man. I know also that Skylark, Rockhouse, Sandals and Couples are doing the same and there are probably more on that list."
