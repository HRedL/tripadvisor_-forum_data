"I know that only outdoor dining is allowed. What good restaurants are open in La Jolla now? I plan to be there in August, now wondering if I should cancel. No sense going if everything is shut down"
Where are to traveling from?I live in San Francisco and wouldn’t go to SoCal if you paid me.
"Who knows? Things are changing fast, and not for the better.I would cancel."
Cancel. Places open now might not be open in August.Come back after the pandemic.
Most all that have patios.
This is not the best time for traveling even if places are open
"If you are flying, I'd cancel. If you are driving, places like Duke's are open and do a nice job separating."
"Restaurant row in La Jolla Shores finally has permission from the city to do street dining. One block of Avenida de la Playa will be closed every day between 11 am and 10 pm so the dozen or so restaurants can accommodate outdoor on-the-street dining. Considering that LJ Shores merchants had previously been dealt huge setbacks due to the never-ending street construction/repair (almost 3 years), I am glad that they now have an opportunity to keep their business afloat. Outdoor (on the street) dining will start on Wednesday, July 22, and will happen daily through September 27."
"""Most all that have patios.""""Most"" means more than 50%. I see you're from Texas. Are you sure about this ""fact""?"
We were there recently. And yes it appeared all the restaurants that have patios were open and busy.
And we all thank you!
"""We all"" Who is we? ""Thank you"" Thank who?"

When California local residents recommend not to come to the State or travel destinations they are being true to travelers. We'd welcome people with open arms if SARs-Cov-2 pandemic wasn't spiking and red zones along with new cases everyday. Those of us who have SIP want to travel but we don't. It's a choice of being moral or immoral. In SoCal coast counties there's 18 million alone that need to get around for essential business and you can't social distance without a structured system which were left on our own to scramble through this. Furthermore this isn't even CA right now. So thanks for delaying what we knew and loved.
"Yes, Work&Travel, look at your Texas statistics. We Californians are very happy to advise on future (after Covid) travel but we cannot, in good conscience recommend that you come here now."
Gee just think if we all thought like Chogs every individual would be traveling because we're not the problem. Traveling compiles the problem. Gawd you sound like a MSNBC recording.Oh and to you I must sound like Fox News .LA doesn't even have signs at parks telling you to wear masks nothing in Spanish which is just about a majority in LA.
"I view my stance in utilitarian and consumerist terms.Right now, and for the foreseeable future, tourist destinations and sights are inferior products. This includes my beloved San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park. George’s and Caroline’s are also inferior experiences at this point. That is not an argument to not patronize them so as to preserve them, but I also believe that folks should do what they can so that these inferior experiences might be restored to pre-pandemic normalcy.I also appreciate that local and out-of-town/out of state visitors spread the virus. But this a matter of risk and community impact. If locals become infected, they tax medical facilities that “belong” to them. If out-of-towners/out-of-staters become infected, not only do they become a burden on local medical facilities, but they risk enormous costs of staying not at home in addition to medical costs."
