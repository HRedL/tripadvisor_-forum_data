Do y’all think there will be any issues with getting back into the US from Cozumel?
"I do not believe that anyone can answer that with any certainty. As of today, the president is saying that any US citizens that have been in the EU will be routed thru airports with advanced screening procedures and are suggesting self quarantine once you arrive home."
"Nope. You may be questioned about your travels and your health, but you’ll get back in."
"LOL - one time when 'we' lost our passports the Coz Immigration officer said, 'You may have a problema with US immigration, but, if they are smart they will look at you, a big gringo with a tan and they will let you in. If not, they will send you back here.' I said, 'uh...Un Momento - you are saying the downside is we get sent back HERE??' He grinned and said, 'Si! and if that happens, 'Welcome to Mexico!' Unfortunately, the US immigration officer let us in. ;)Edited: 7:30 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Interesting , Sam. So you had already lost your passport when you entered Cozumel? I have lost mine in Mexico but was easy to get replaced by the US Consulate.As far as others routinely having a problem returning to Mexico now, I cannot imagine why. Of course, things change."
momma- What month? IMO nobody can say for absolute sure. I bet it'll be fine. Asking on here is rather a wild goose chase.
"The issue with banning flights has been tied to countries with many cases of the Wuhan virus.That does not apply to Cancun.Then when travel has been impacted, US citizens have been returned to the US. In the case of the cruise ship by a chartered aircraft,."
They just closed Disney. There’s a chance anything else can get closed. No one has a crystal ball but I would be cautious.
"Closing Disney is not the same as closing the border to American citizens. Well, maybe it is for Disney fans.Edited: 8:47 pm, March 12, 2020 "

"""I said, 'uh...Un Momento - you are saying the downside is we get sent back HERE??' He grinned and said, 'Si! and if that happens, 'Welcome to Mexico!' Unfortunately, the US immigration officer let us in. ;)""LOL Sam! Exactly what I would have thought of! Today I was told by the nursing home that my dad is in, they will no longer allow ANY visitors, which I go everyday. But, understandable it is for the residents safety. Not to mention the hand sanitizer in the dining room has been empty way before the virus was even talked about :( Therefore, I am looking into putting a camera in his room. Any suggestions on which one is better than the others? I'd like to have one that I could check on my phone (live video) and have it also record. Sorry, I'm just realizing that I should have had a whole new post for this."
"Sorry to hear about that regarding your Dad, vicki. But suppose no choice. Wish I could help about the camera but sure someone here can. That is a great idea."
"Sam, I'm confused by your post.Did you lose your passports here in Mexico? If so, they would have been easily and quickly replaced.And I don't understand why or where you were talking to an Immigration agent upon leaving the country. You don't go through Immigration to leave Mexico. Or did the airline ticket agent get an agent because you couldn't produce your passport?Whichever it is it's lucky you obviously speak Spanish because so many of the agents either don't speak English or just a few words."

"If airlines stop flying...you might have a problem getting back to the USA. Delta just went to the government asking for a bail out so they can keep flying. They also just ceased all flights TO Europe Now that the government has gone along with the airlines being allowed to cancel at the gate if they do not have enough people for the ""profit level""...so then you have to find another airline...could miss connections...and this can take more than even a day or two. Other airlines will be following Delta...for sure..as all their stocks are so far down...operating will be hard. You stop flying Europe...where do you store those planes, those personnel, and what about client cancels forever!! Things are not pretty now.Edited: 3:26 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Joan S. 'we' lost our passports between CUN and CZM. It was over Christmas so the consulates were closed for two weeks. We talked to EVERYBODY on the island about what to do and luckily ran into a wonderful immigration agent. When I told him our story , looking at my wife, he said in Spanish, 'Did SHE lose the passports??' I answered, 'Si' He said 'Doh!' And then he told us in perfect English what to do. samEdited: 4:49 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"On the 'lost passports' thing, I would tell anybody, it's not a big deal. For one thing, Mexican Immigration is your compadre and the USA Immigration has everything on you and knows when you left the country. Don't panic. Especially if you are a 'big gringo with a tan' :) ;sam"
just got back last week no problem just toke a lot longer and they are asking if you have been to china added that to the form
"I was just at the hospital and they asked if I'd been to China in the last three weeks. I honestly answered:'No, but I'd love to!' sam"
"Given the ineptitude of the ""Administration"" and it's equally inept methods, I would be surprised if anyone picked up any infection you may be carrying upon reentry."
"Bottom-line, without any cruise ships what are we going to Pick up in Cozumel that we wouldn't on the streets of a more infected region like the good ole USofA?World Traveler you are currently coming across as a Holier than thou travel shamer...just so you know.Edited: 8:31 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"""If airlines stop flying...you might have a problem getting back to the USA.""Based upon recent events I don't see that happening. US citizens and legal residents are being allowed back into the USA.Depending upon where they were, screening or even some level of quarantine might occur. At this point I don't see a near-term issue with travel to the Cancun area."
"If World traveler cares that they come across as a holier than thou travel shamer. I commend themIt’s time for us to realize that the elderly and immunocompromised will likely die if exposed to the virus. I don’t want to be a be a vector that unknowingly spreads the virus. I am not high risk but my patients friends neighbors and loved ones are. I can stay home for while. Another vacation will happen. We are all in this together, time to act like it."
"I'd say it's more dangerous in nearly ANY American city right now than in Cozumel as far as picking it up due to the cruise ships being cancelled and air traffic being nil. It's not as if we are going to Europe and it's currently unrestricted by the fed to travel to Cozumel and Cancun...if they restrict Mexico or we think we won't be able to get home, then we won't go...otherwise we will go on Tuesday and support the good people of Cozumel who are going to need it prior to coming home and likely being infected in the states by someone here where our infection rates are MUCH MUCH higher. We aren't suppose to take a cruise, we aren't. we aren't suppose to fly to eroupe or basically asia...we aren't...This is a travel forum...it's suppose to support and answer questions about travel...not shame people who decide to travel to areas that are unrestricted by their governments.Edited: 9:21 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"The government is too slow. We should have had travel restrictions in January. It’s not about the rate in Cozumel right now. It’s about preventing spread which is exponential. Testing is not adequate right now and all travel should be minimal. I don’t have time to explain, but try looking at the CDC recommendations from Dr Fauci if you really want to know. Also I doubt you would listen to me ."
"We re-entered the US today through Houston Hobby. It took all of 5 minutes or less to breeze through since they started using facial recognition from your passport. They didn't even look at our passports, although we have Global Entry, there were no lines at the booths. The Global Entry kiosks would have taken more time"
"I'm off this week with limited vaca, I've purchased this trip for the wife and I who have recently gone through a VERY VERY traumatic life event...I have no more time off than this week...I work at a hospital...I wash my hands and use sanitizer every 20 minuates...no lie. The numbers don't support the over zealous caution to this point...we have about 65K active world wide cases...what is the total world population? Mexico has EIGHT active confirmed cases...Texas has what 28? I'd rather be in a place where the populace hasn't totally lost all sense of sanity...even if I'm stuck for a month on a beach....hope we aren't as my spouse would rather that not happen...but I could use it... you don't know our situation."
You work at a hospital? You will Be quarantined when you get back.We all have personal stories. I wish you the best but don’t advise traveling. I work at a hospital too and know enough to not risk my patients or coworkers by travel at the moment. Hope you have two weeks of supplies for when you get home and are quarantined. Yes this sucks but for everyone. Whatever your personal story is does not make you exempt from infection or for being a vector for infection to others.
"I saw a funny cartoon this morning. It read, 'Everybody who can work from home please do so. All y'all who are in health care, well, saddle up beetches. We ride at dawn!' that is the fact. these heroes ride every day for US! Never forget that. samEdited: 10:48 pm, March 13, 2020 "
I don’t know why you’d want to come back here. It’s pretty ugly already. My son’s friend works at target. She was restocking toilet paper and suffered a severe head injury as people trampled her.
""" I am not high risk but my patients friends neighbors and loved ones are.""Here is the crux of this issue. It is not up to everyone to be the primary protector of those at risk. Those who are in facilities like nursing homes or hospitals need an environment and staff and protection protocols that are more than adequate to ensure their well-being.Those who are at risk of dying if they contract Wuhan virus or the flu but are not in that type setting have the responsibility to take measures to protect themselves.You don't take irrational knee-jerk reactions that will cause immeasurable harm to multiple economies acting as if this virus has a 50% mortality rate. Obviously people who get sick with a cold or flu should stay home until well to avoid spreading the virus but we know that people go to work sick all the time.It is not reasonable to tell people to not go on vacation when their risks are so low as to be negligible.Use suitable precautions. Wear a mask if effective on the plane if you so choose. I won't make it to Cozumel in the next week or three and it is cold and snowy here so all I ask is that some of you please sit on a lounger in the shade, look out at the beautiful blue water, run your feet in the sand and think ""CO Pilot would like this.""Maybe a take a picture from under the lounger showing feet in sand and water in the distance.Edited: 11:50 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"No just because I work at a hospital it doesn't mean that I will have to be quarantined...I'm not in patient care...I'm an Real Estate guy who runs physicians buildings...I'm not going to be in direct contact with patient populations. I work in a hospital, but I do not work for the hospital, they lease space from my company. I guess They could attempt to put me in quarantine but I would charge them for that time. Believe me, they won't do that unless I'm sick and then I would just stay in Cozumel and work from there. It's complicated....but I do really hope to make this trip and I promise not to infect anyone upon return...because I'm less likely to be sick if I go rather than stay (just based on the numbers)...plus I agree with those who are NOT freaking out."
"Wow you are both irresponsible and uneducated about this virus.The virus spreads before symptoms develop so if you wait till you are sick you have already infected people. The elderly and immunocompromised are not just in hospitals and elderly care homes. They are in our communities and yes it is our responsibility to care for them. Just like we take precautions to slow down ours cars in streets near schools to protect kids walking to school. In Houston the Rodeo is a BFD. Tens of thousands visit daily. Montgomery county had its first community acquired case of Covid19- meaning no travel recently, no known sick contacts. Guess where that person was just before he became symptomatic? Yep, the rodeo. Serving in a BBQ tent! They shut that Rodeo down as quick as possible, mid day, no warning.You want to keep our beloved Cozumel covid19 free? Don’t travel there and be a vector. Please stop spreading disinformation.And high risk is smokers, asthmatics and peopleOver 60."
We have paid for the condo. The owner won’t refund our money. So if the plane is still flying we will be on it next Saturday. Seems like it won’t be too crowded at least.
"CP, I am shocked you said this, #31. I'm sure many of us ""regulars"" have lost all respect for your opinions. SMH.Hopefully enough of us report that as Spam, and the community can get it removed. Just dreadful."
"I'd say you are caught up in the media hysteria trap that has ensnared our entire country and really a lot of the world...certainly social distancing is a good measure to take...but locking oneself in the basement and hording toilet tissue is not a way to live and it's WAY OUT of proportion to the threat size we are dealing with...do yourself a favor and turn off the news, then after a day or two do some research on past viral threats and our reactions to them and the amount of lives lost by percentage in comparison to this one. I think, IF you have an open place left in your mind left, that the hype from this hasn't blown totally WAY...you will see that yes, Certainly, this warrants caution, but when we start SEVERLY restricting freedom of movement there is GOING TO BE push back and logic and hopefully logic and prudence wins (it's losing now)... It's as if an overzealous doctor has decided we have to have a heart transplant when all we perhaps needed was a stint...NOT only that, he's forcing us to get the transplant against our will. As far as social distancing is concerned...Cozumel is going to have that by Tuesday far more than the metroplex where I'm going to be leaving from...when I return I will once again be far more likely to get it and spread it than on my travel path...which will be nearly vacant and we will be avoiding other travelers as was our plan in the first place...GET AWAY FROM IT ALL. IF our government in all their ""wisdom"" decides we shouldn't go to Cozumel...we won't. We have until Tuesday to see if society continues this spiral of fear and dread we are currently lock in."
Goodness the only way to limit this is to block travel.You are ignorant.
Ignorant is being kind.
If the US government or CDC tell us not to go to Mexico we will not go...if they don't we will. The people of Cozumel that make minimum wages and are HIGHLY dependent on travel and that travel is going to be drastically reduced over AT LEAST the next month. May God bless and keep each and every member of this forum both those that agree and disagree and their families! Be safe in this troubled time. AND for the people of the beautiful island of Cozumel may you rest assured that your needs will be met despite this huge financial loss that this pandemic and it's world wide reaction have forced upon you. I am sorry I expressed my opinion to the traveling public who frequents this site. No harm was meant in it.

"Joan, if you really care about protecting people you should have the Q.Roo governor shut down all tourism for at least a month or until the virus becomes a non-issue."
"Why are you not concerned about the flu?  Influenza you mean? Influenza kills about 0.1% of those who get it. We have a vaccine annually to prevent as well as Tamiflu to treat it. And there may be some immunity naturally if you had it last year.Covid19 kills about 3% of those who get it. No vaccine, no treatment. Also testing poor so that number may not be quite accurate admittedly.Regardless Covid19 kills more people and no one has immunity to this novel virus. Novel means new so of course no one has immunity. Of course I am worried about influenza. That’s why I get a vaccine each year. That’s why I wash my hands carefully and cover my cough. And it would be great if the USA had health care for all or would pay for sick people to stay home. That’s why I vote for candidates that agree with that.Edited: 8:42 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Shutting down tourism for a month is a great idea!!
"""Joan, if you really care about protecting people you should have the Q.Roo governor shut down all tourism for at least a month or until the virus becomes a non-issue.""Because of course the Governor is going to listen to me, lol."

Mexico is considering shutting its border with US to keep infection out. I won’t be surprised if they announce this.
Re entry to the states is very chaotic right now. They are trying to test incoming passengers but don't have the personnel or protocol on place. Expect long lines and loing wait.

"Agree, WT. As far as I know, the name if Covid-19. Not sure the need to call it what it is not.And so far, the Quintana Roo Governor has not asked my opinion. But , he might be more inclined to listen to comments by those on the scene rather than those commenting from afar.I really to try to listen to opinions of medical professionals rather than advice here."
In that case I don't know why people are even giving advice on here about it. Besides that the situation is changing so much so fast that info becomes quickly....a moot point.
"I agree, froglegs. I do tend to pay attention to what is published from the official agencies or someone here with a medical background. But the general comments are all over the place and only add to the confusion, in my opinion."
"#50 of 53 ·And, true to his mindset, CP refers to Covid-19 as ""Wuhan Virus"".Where have I heard that kind of racist rhetoric before?(""Foreign virus"")Because that's what it was called for weeks prior to being renamed? While I would agree that it should no longer be be called that, it could easily be an honest mistake. All virus used to be called by their point of origin until it was realized that it created social stigma. But the medical community takes a good while to name new viruses so the point of origin is still used until they get their act together. Don't be so quick to call someone racist. You end up looking like a SJW."
Wait what? SJW I don’t know what that isGoogle says social justice warrior. I would be proud to be called that.
Is that what SJW means?I had absolutely no idea.
