Any risk of dengue fever these days mirissia is there any epidemic of dengue fever transmitted mosquitoes
Not something i would worry about in Mirissa. Take standard mosquito precautions such as repellant even in daytime. Ensure good mosquito net in room and even plug in repellent for room.
"You find mosquito almost everywhere in Sri Lnaka. Usually the tourist establishments especially dealing with foreigners have all the facilities to protect them from these risks as much as possible. Nets are fitted in the rooms and you could use some local ointments to keep the mosqitos away. Please walk in to any local medicalshop & ask for "" Citronella oil"" it would help. Dont take middlemen to buy this....Cheers & happy travels!"
"I lived and worked in Sri Lanka for 6 years and still visit annually. YES, Dengue is rife all over Sri Lanka. Having suffered a bout of Dengue fever, contracted in Sri Lanka, I would recommend using the highest deet content repellent that you can find. I now use repel 100 insect repellent, available on Amazon . Yes, it melts nail varnish and the straps of your rubber of plastic sandals, so lightly apply it between the straps. Yes, it is a fairly strong chemical. Yes it is a little oily and strong smelling but only for a few seconds after application. Yes it tastes horrible if you don’t wash your hands after application. I found the best way to apply it was to spray a little onto my hands and thinly apply it to all areas of skin, even those that will be covered by clothing, but between the straps of sandals. REMEMBER, you are only wearing it for the period of your holiday, not the rest of your life, so it won’t kill you. I can assure you that Dengue is worst than any problems that deet will cause. Even in the dry seasons when mosquitoes are fairly dormant, it will take only 1 dengue mosquito bite to give you the illness. High content Deet will also protect you against, Malaria and Japanese Encephalitis. I personally use high content deet now rather than take malaria tablets, which do not protect against dengue or Japanese Encephalitis. Dengue is also known as breakbone fever, for good reason, you feel freezing cold and shivering in temperatures of over 40 degrees, you are almost delirious, your blood count can drop drastically and it takes weeks to get back to good health again. It is BAD, Japanese Encephalitis can kill you. Don’t take the risk just for the sake of being eco friendly for a month! Over the years I tried many natural and low deet products, hence I contracted dengue, the mosquitoes love me, I have never been bitten whilst using repel 100. Low deet and natural products will definitely not offer the same safeguard as high deet products."
"While it is true that you need to take precautions against dengue, it does not mean that you have to be lathered in deet the whole time. Also, I don't know why you would take malaria pills as that disease has not been present in Sri Lanka for some time."
