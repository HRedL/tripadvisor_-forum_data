"Friends at Tripadvisor Barcelona Forum:Arriving in Barcelona in May with a group of 38 travelers (mostly senior citizens). Staying at Hotel Gaudi for three days prior to a cruise. Am overwhelmed in trying to inform these folks of how best to select and navigate the many amazing sights! Am considering suggesting the following: day of arrival spending time on Ramblas (nearby and walkable). Day two: hop on/hop off bus for a good overview of the city and hopping off at places of interest (a bus stop is very close to our hotel). For day three: suggesting (in consideration of our limited time) a good organized tour that will cover most of the Gaudi sights and will include ""skip the line"" tickets. Any specific tour company suggestions are appreciated. Am assuming that booking through Viator and Tripadvisor sites are safe and reliable. Others? Many thanks in advance for any suggestions!"
"You forgot to mention, conveniently (given the reactions you got last time), that you are a ""professional travel agent"", and that you are basically asking us to do for free the work that you get paid for..."

"You were given advice on your other thread about contacting professionals in Barcelona that you can pay to assist you with this task. As a travel agent yourself, you must realize how valuable assistance from local agents who are used to dealing with large groups can be."
"Hi Rick, I gave you my thoughts about the HoHo bus, “skip the line” tickets, and Viator in my post 6 of your prior thread: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18749…Those views were not influenced by anything that changed in this thread, so I refer you back to them. Good luck."
"I would not take a cruise at this time because of the danger of the coronavirus. If someone has this on the ships, one can easily get it too. The danger is very real.https:/…coronavirus-japan-cruise-ship.html"
Not only unprofessional but also deceitful.... repeating the same post minus the part you're a travel agent and that you're asking others to do your work for free won't win you any sympathies in this community. Sorry.
"What makes you think that booking through Viator and TripAdvisor sites is safe and reliable? These big companies are just re-sellers that will put anyone on their site as long as they pay them a commission so nothing there tells you that the actual tour operator is any good.By the way, Viator and TripAdvisor are the same people."
"Hi Enric. I, too, was troubled by the second post without the “travel agent” line, so I did some quick research. It appears that the OP is a retired psychologist who works (volunteers?) with at least two non-profits, AOT arranging flights for veterans of WWII, Korea and Vietnam. It is not clear that he actually works as a paid travel agent. Rather, I surmise (but do not know) that he organizes groups of seniors who take cruises. Absent more information, I am inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I certainly understand the concerns voiced by others."
