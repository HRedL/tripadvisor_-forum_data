"So ""Potential Tropical Storm 15"" is expected to be named Maria and be a hurricane in the next 24hrs. It is currently listed on NHC website as ""Potential Tropical Cyclone 15"". Current models (all are pretty much in agreement on strengthening and track) are showing it hitting Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic mid week around the 20th. My question is, what is the typical SOP for the hotels. Will they give you option to leave or is it a forced evacuation and they refuse to let you stay? If I wanted to ride it out, will they let you? I am scheduled to arrive tomorrow, Sunday and as of right now it is not named, no watches, no warnings so canceling the trip and taking advantage of the insurance is not doable. Here's to hoping Jose` slows down, and pulls Maria north...Edited: 2 years ago "
HiPersonally I think it is a BIG leap to turn what is listed as a Tropical Depression into a Hurricane and from what I have read NHC makes no mention of itEdited: 2 years ago 
"…noaa.gov/storm_graphics/AT15/AL152017_5day_…Not only do they mention it, they have been running models on it.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I will be going to Punta Cana on the 28th, also worried about what can become Maria"
"Not sure on your insurance, but ours let us cancel this morning without penalty. We booked through Expedia. It was a bummer decision for us. Praying for all the best!"
Not being unkind but why book a holiday in the hurricane season as there is always a chance of such weather fronts being around
"We going on the 23rd and looking forward to it , counting the days . We always go in Sept/oct"

"Being that hurricane season encompasses every day in summer, I'm not sure that matters too much."
"Regarding ""forced evacuation"" I know a handful of resorts evacuated guests to other resorts. Most if not all resorts have hurricane plans in place. The resort I am familiar with allowed guests to stay, some were moved to safer rooms. The beach was closed and off limits. During the height of the potential threat guests were required to stay in their rooms where food and beverages were delivered by staff."
I fly on Thursday pay yer money take chance it's out of everyone's hands
What airline are you flying.Jetblue is letting you reschedule without penalty for travel through 9/20 (which is when we are going).
By the way we haven't decided if we are going to cancel.
Flying in on Tuesday 9/19. Appreciate the updates.
"I also fly on Thursday , but I'm a bit worried"
"I would love to hear PC Mike's input and opinions on this storm. Based on what is already known/forcasted, do you suspect much impact on the punta cana area next week? I land Tuesday afternoon.Appreciate the updates"
"Flying on Thursday with Copa and staying for 8 nights at Melia. Now Im planning to postpone the trip for 2 days. I know I won t have any problem with Copa, just have to contact the hotel."
"""Based on what is already known/forcasted""You can probably read the beginning of the Hurricane Irma threads...and the answers will be astonishingly similar! The biggest difference is that Maria shouldn't be as strong as Irma...but then again original forecasts didn't show Irma becoming larger than a Category 4 storm. Instead, it became one of the longest lasting, largest storms on record!Which also means, weather forecasts are to be taken as a guide, not gospel. Keep an eye on it, but don't freak out about it. A lot can change in 5 or 6 days."
"Current models are predicting Maria to become a Cat 2 or 3 within 72 hours from the time I am posting this, and it will be somewhere near the Leewards. Longer-term projections (120 hours) put it over the DR at a Cat 1, 2, or 3. But that far out it's pretty likely to change, based on my watching of this.All the various steering forces are aiming it right at the DR so far, as well as some of the Leewards that got hit so hard by Irma. I feel for them, given the amount of destruction they have already been through.Definitely keep watching the National Hurricane Center's website at http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ for updates. I also like stormcarib at http://stormcarib.com/ which has more discussion and models."
Irma was predicted to hit SC where I live head on as a cat 4 and came in as a tropical storm.Things change quickly so check the National Hurricane site.
"Just to another link for info, www.tropicaltidbits.com has a ton of tools, maps, models, etc. For twice daily live discussions from a meteorologist who is based in NYC and focused on the tropics, look up and watch the live streams by Joe Cioffi.https:/…UCgbLhz8ataTPSMxkULKgNmAHe usually does two live streams and answers questions as best as he can with the data he has. He doesn't hype anything but will explain it in layman's terms so it's easy to understand."
Run for the hills
"I would try cancel with the airline and the hotel, or see if credit card you paid with will cover you. Even if hotel let's you ride it out, it's a pain, more than likely you lose power (like w Irma and not all hotels have generators that cover the room areas, and it is really hot and humid in PR right now, so sleeping w/o A/C is an agony). I would not risk it if you can make cancellation plans"

"I have been going on vacation late September to Punta Cana for the past 20 or so years. I have never encountered a hurricane or tropical storm in all those years, actually I have never even lost an entire day due to weather. Now maybe my luck ran out with Maria out there, I am arriving Tuesday for 8 nights but I am staying hopeful. Keep in mind that a hurricane is about 100 miles across, so the chance that it will directly impact your exact location is pretty slim. Punta Cana Mike, I am counting on you for updates. Great job with Irma,very impressed with your patience and all your updates, before, during and after. You, sir, are a wealth of insight and information. Keep up the good work. Thanks, and of course, CHEERS"
"Okay, so I just saw Maria's probable path. Very scary for an already fragile environment due to Irma. However, at this point no one can say anything for sure. Irma made a few unexpected moves. It is safe to say that hurricanes, although somewhat predictable remain in essence unpredictable. Dave, I don't think that there is a clear answer to your question. I think it depends on regional policies. We were forced to evacuate some years ago when we were caught in the path of a hurricane. Hope all works out for you, stay safe."
Please keep us posted if you are able to get more information. We are schedule to arrive in Punta Cana on the 21st. We were sooo looking forward to this vacation. Hoping for the best. What I was able to read only mentioned the Hurricane passing near Dominican Republic on thursday
"Rushdenfoxy..we cancelled due to the cone being right over Punta Cana in the National Hurricane Model 5-day forcast with ""100 percent"" chance of cyclone formation. Wish we didn't have to, a big bummer, but not worth the worry and having to land and make plans to get out. We will come in January or February. I've been watching this system for a few days, and now it has a good potential to pick up even more.Edited: 2 years ago "
We fly out on Tuesday from Birmingham and a little scared now as this new storm approaches the Dominican really don't know what we are going to do as if we cancel we will loose a lot of our money and been looking for other destinations to go to but everywhere is all fully booked up
So Hurricane Irma was a cat 5 and loads of people cancelled there holidays and yet no damage was caused to pc or little to pp and the very next day people were enjoying there holidays and loving the sunshine.This storm if it hits is said to be a cat 2 or 3 and still has a few days to either stay on cousre or veer north.I think it's the poor locals who take the most damage as the hotels are built very well.We fly out on sat 23rd and have not even considered cancelling. If we get a couple of days with strong winds so be it as this won't affect our holiday and our enjoyment of visiting our fav place.
We fly out tomorrow what your operator are you with?Edited: 2 years ago 
We are with Thomson flying from Gatwick
"We are flying with American tomorrow evening, scheduled to arrive Tuesday afternoon. We are going to ride out whatever comes our way!"
Go there and have a good time. I'll fly to PC on Sep. 30th...I'll surely be asking you about the conditions after Maria.
"Haha! I'm here in Punta Cana now. It is HOT AF!! I arrived Friday the 15th, and it rained all day and night! But who cares it's still beautiful Punta Cana!! Hasn't rained since, They're calling for rain on Thursday and Friday and that's when the models show Maria arriving, I'm hoping it does the same as Irma and bypasses this area, I fly home Friday. There is Zero mention of Maria here. The only info I have is FB and here on TA I'm not worried and u shouldn't be either."
Same here - we are flying out on 23rd from Birmingham. I won't deny - we are bit concerned but nothing we can do now but sit and wait - by the time we arrive Maria will be gone so let's hope it won't do much harm to anyone and anything...

"this storm is not likely to miss the DR as Irma did,, may as well concede that it is going to hitthe bigger question will be what strength it hits withthe biggest concern will be flooding, ive seen the PC airport and area flood with smaller stormswill be a interesting week on TA,Oh by the way people who live there cant tell you any better or worse what the hurricane situation forecast ..www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&fdays=2best to follow the National Hurricane Center"
"""this storm is not likely to miss the DR as Irma did,, may as well concede that it is going to hit""Based on what? The forecast at this point for Maria is exactly the same as it was for Irma, just less intensity. Irma eventually jogged to the north."
The fact that it’s not taking the same path as Irma. Plus the high pressure that was in the North Atlantic. That pulled Irma North is now gone.
I'm also scheduled to fly out on the 23rd from Houston. All we can do at this point is continue to watch the forecast and Maria's path.
"""The fact that it’s not taking the same path as Irma.""If it didn't happen yet, how it that fact?"
"There hasn't been a major hit on Florida for some years, why wouldn't you book between June and November.Edited: 2 years ago "
I'm here now and are supposed to fly home on Thursday to Manchester so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it tracks north.
Hi. I also fly from Birmingham on the 23rd. I hope Maria will not cause any damage to PC and all of us will enjoy well deserved holidays.Looking on the predictions models and I think it's to early to say if it veers of north of DR or not. I hope that we all be sitting by the pool this time next week as Maria should pass by then.
"I'm coming in from Atlanta on the 25th. Hopefully, all is well then. However, the 10 day forecast looks bleak."
Us too. I looked up earlier flights just in case but nothing is available.
That's abit rude isn't it? Like come onEdited: 2 years ago 
"We arrive on the 22, I have a bad feeling flights will be cancelled"
I'm set to arrive Tuesday as well...im bummed because I don't want to cancel
"The hurricane is set to hit PC on thursday, the day I was supposed to arrive. By when do you think the winds are gone? Do u think it s gone by saturday?"
"Sometimes the trouble comes after the storm. There may not be power, the airport may be damaged, the water and sewage system may be damaged, etc. Would you have enough food and water? How will you get home? Will you be safe from looters?"
"FYI Air Canada just called, our Monday 18th flight YYZ to Punta Cana has been cancelled."
Sounds like they made the decision for ya.... I checked my flight and it's still on for Tuesday but I have a feeling that will be changing
"I was hoping to make the call early tomorrow, but yes, take outta my hands."
Here now. Supposed to fly home Thursday. The day it is to arrive. It will be interesting what Canadian operators do. Did they set a presedent by sending planes with Erma. Was in Cat 4 Dennis in Cuba in 2005 so have an idea what might be coming.
AC cancelled for Sept 18th Good will police in affect for Domincan Rep. We have the option to rebook and travel by April 30 2018 or get a full refund Good luck to everyone who is travelling or on the island stay safe
Carribbean Travel - Why not try and jump on an earlier flight?
Sunwing won't cancel they never do makes it harder.
Has anyone ever heard of people being refunded for their trip due to your flights being cancelled if you don't have trip insurance?
Clare I wouldn't worry too much.....it hasn't even been mentioned here yet so the locals don't seem worried at all and we travelled with Thomson due to leave Saturday. They will also do everything they can to keep you safe if anything does change.
"Scheduled to arrive in Punta Cana September 23.. I have vacationed in the Caribbean once before in hurricane season with no trouble luckily.. very worried though now as I am not sure what to expect. I'm aware that the worst of Maria is forecast to be passed by then, but concerned about the potential damage post-storm. Trip insurance will only allow the trip to be cancelled without penalty by Tuesday evening. Any updates or advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"Good evening...round 2 is about to begin and this time it is not likely to be a brush by as Irma was. Current models have Maria coming very close to us, but the 4 day cone is very wide at the moment, thus a lot can happen in a few days.There is a very strong and likely chance of tropical storm force winds, which would be our best scenario on Thursday. Puerto Rico will have a big influence on the track as the island often pushes storms north or south. The worst case would be a shift to the south, putting us in the strongest quadrant for wind and rain. This would also put at higher risk, the entire south coast and Haiti as well.A shift to the north would result in conditions similar to what Irma gave us. This is what we want Maria to do, but wishing does little to influence weather patterns...lolHave to wait a day or two to figure this one out.CheersPuntaCanaMike"
"Absolutely. But it all depends on the airline. We're set to arrive on Sept 23 in Punta Cana, and i know if a hurricane advisory is in effect, Air Transat will release a hurricane policy... which allows us to rebook within 90 days - no charge!"
"I'm sorry, I didn't ask my question correctly...will the resort give us a refund. Since we didn't cancel, our airline did. And we don't have trip insurance."
"Another side note....here we are, a few days away from a potential hit and when I went shopping today...just another day in the tropics! No line ups...no shortages of anything. I have not seen any signs of people boarding up windows yet or any other prep. Most are totally aware, but no mass panic or major concerns.Tuesday and Wednesday are when activity will start.CheersPCMike"
"PC MIKe when was the last time Ounta Cana had a hurricane land fall? I am curious bc u mention about Peutro Rico pushing the same North or South, kind of like a protective factor? Was that the case with Irma as well?"
"The last hurricane was in 2004. The actual point of landfall was Uvero Alto. Jeanne lost wind power quite quickly when hitting the mountains, but the big issue was the amount of rain that she produced. I believe Flipflopman was at Excellence during that time.""After crossing Puerto Rico, Jeanne reached hurricane strength on September 16 near the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola,[5] but fell back to tropical storm strength later that day as it moved across the mountainous island.[6] Jeanne moved offshore the Dominican Republic late in the afternoon of September 17.[7] By that time, Jeanne had weakened to tropical depression strength.[8] Even though Jeanne did not strike Haiti directly, the storm was large enough to cause flooding and mudslides, particularly in the northwestern part of the country.[9]"
Do you think that incoming flights might get cancelled for thursday? We are supposed to arrive by 11:20 am.
"I don't get this one. Hurricane Maria is almost sure to hit St. Martin which is already a mess from Irma and barely a peep is being made, not on the news nor on its forum. Guys like PCMike are looking at Maria with a watchful eye, yet again, nothing on the news and many people who are aware seem to think that hurricanes are simply rain and wind and that all is good the next day. Devastation can follow and I truly hope it doesn't, but it shouldn't be something that you view as an adventure or something you hope to ride out without being evicted by the resort.It seems as if people were almost overly obsessed with Irma and nonchalant with Maria. If I wasn't regularly on the National Hurricane Center site, I'm not sure that I'd even know about is one."
"Leticia, I would expect flights to be cancelled on Thursday, but if Maria bends a little to the north...who knows at this early time."
I'm due to fly into Punta Cana on 9/20 and stay until 9/24. Right when Hurricane Maria is set to go through. I'm debating canceling my trip. Don't want to get stranded there if Maria hits hard. What is the local weather stations in Punta Cana saying about it and are people there preparing or concerned about being hit by Maria?
"I was booked to fly out tommarrow the 18th with Sunwing to PUNTA CANA, I called Sunwing 3 times today and they knew nothing about Maria, Playing stupid maybe I don't know. But they gave no option, except that if it hits Punta Cana, the options would be, evacuate us to another part of the island, or if its really bad send in planes to fly us out ahead of time. I mean really why would I want to fly in on Monday, to possibly be flown home on wednesday. I asked if I would be refunded my 5 days if I was forced to evacuate. She had no answer for me, so I assume if they had no answer for me, then the answer was ""no refunds"" I didnt take trip insurance, with sunwing but I do have it automatically on my Mastercard, so I called them and cancelled my trip, and will submit a claim. I do not want to take any chance with our lives, Nor do I want to be anywhere near a potential hurricane hit. Is it worth your life? Not mine."
"For new viewers and future travelers to Punta Cana. Take my word for it, Punta Cana Mike was spot on for Hurricane Irma. Even when others on the site were bad mouthing him, he provided great insight. My wife and I are heading to PC on October 2nd. I guarantee I will be following his posts. Thanks PC Mike."
"Based on nhc models, Maria slight turning up north.."
"Heading to the Hard Rock Tuesday morning. Tomorrow will for sure be a day of contemplation. PC Mike, your updates and insights are greatly appreciated. The value you provided updating everyone during Irma was exceptional. Hopefully tomorrow there will be slightly more certainty and I can make a decision accordingly. Praying for the safety of all those affected."
Stephen I'm flying out of Newark tuesday... we have a lot too think about as well
I was going to cuba for the 16th on the 12th sunwing cancelled and we booked for dr I called them today and we leave tomorrow and they would not help us at all they are disgusting and I will never travel with them again
yes if they cancel you will be refunded rebooked or get a ttravel voucher it happened to us last week regarding cuba
"I am flying out of Newark as well on Tuesday, fingers crossed, hoping Maria turns north. Do you guys realize that we can have our flight cancelled because of Jose, not Maria on Tuesday.? Think positive, whatever will be , will be. That is my new motto."
"We were at Iberostar Bavaro when hurricane irma passes by on Sept 6. Basically we were told to stay in our rooms and the food had delivered to our door with a candle and matches in case of power outrage. Some of guests were forced to move to safer rooms from the beach. We were very lucky that irma didn't hit us though...we lost 2 days of the vacation due to heavy rain and wind but we enjoyed 5 days of sunny hot days with the empty resort! (PC airport was closed for 2-3 days, no one was checking in and lots of ppl left as Air Transat and Westjet forced the guests to leave PC. Airlines didn't give options to customers or they had to pay for the return airline tickets) we probably will never book PC vacation again in Sept...I know it's so much cheaper but too risky due to hurricanes. We don't want to ever feel so hopeless again when irma hits, locking ourselves in hotel rooms. Best wishes!"
July to November is hurricane season... oh i know let's not book lol lol .
"A lot of folks on the forums brush these hurricanes off as if it's just another tropical storm. Even without a direct hit they bring lots of rain, strong winds, etc. Is that how you want to spend days of your vacation? If you have the option to rebook, consider going later or to another destination that is not in the path of the storm. We just got back from 7 sunny days in puerto morelos Mexico after initially being booked for PC. Yes, it may cost a little more for changes etc but totally worth it."

"Vadim, did you feel safe in Mexico? I think I would worry more there with the contaminated liquor, the drug gangs and the crime rate. I think I like my chances better in Punta Cana."
"We're due to fly into Punta Cana on Thursday. Even if Maria is north, I'm worried about even being able to fly in Thursday. Hopfuly the Punta Cana area will be okay like they were during Irma but we're still not sure if we should bail to somewhere else. Don't really want to do Mexico again."
Micheal R: question if I have insurance on my trip is it easy to switch it to another spot last minute ? Just asking Bc you said you may hear else where
I also am going on the 29th and am starting to worry a little. I thought we'd be in be in the clear after Irma.
Hurricane season is almost 5 months. Of course people are going to travel to the carribean within those 5 months. Hurricanes like this don't happen that often. I
"The hurricane season in the Atlantic/Caribbean region coincides with high summer in the Mediterranean/Aegean. The high season in the Caribbean coincides with winter in the Mediterranean area. The Canaries have spring/summer weather year round and no hurricanesWe travel to the Aegean or the Mediterranean in summer, the Canaries spring & autumn and to the Caribbean in winter. We know it makes sense."
"""Hurricane season is almost 5 months.""Wrong. Hurricane season is 6 months: June 1 thru Nov. 30."
I will be on PC from 07 october to 14 hope Maria will be gone at this date...
@badrdD Maria will be gone by end of this Thursday (21 Sept).. what the damage will be is another story - but that's a question for Friday really.
Think its looking likely that our flight will be cancelled on the Thursday unless something changes drastically. Just waiting on an update from the agent so that we know what we are doing!
"I wanted to book Varadero early October, now i wait. I nearly booked Punta Cana this week ? Because of Irma..."
To the guy concerned about Maria on the 28th: Maria will be long gone by then. We are slated to arrive in Punta Cana on the 22nd. A bit worried but will wait a day or two before deciding whether to cancel and hit the Riveria Maya instead. Insurance isn't usually used but man does it provide peace of mind!Edited: 2 years ago 
"Maria may cause more damage. I have been following Varadero close. Only now some resorts are opening. Cayo Coco airport was destroyed, they are not opening until high season."
Sounds like flights to Dominican have been cancelled !
"We are about to get on our flight to PC. We tried to change our reservation but travel insurance won't kick in since our flight is going and no news from the resort on cancelling. I called the resort yesterday and they said they hadn't even heard about the storm yet. We are supposed to check out next Monday, but I have a feeling our trip will be cut short and we will leave Wednesday. We are hoping it heads north but will only be able to watch and wait. Mike, any updates or new thoughts on this one?"
"No i am waiting for m'y flight to Punta Cana,they offre me to cancelll but still going will see"
@good-times-1971Sounds like flights to Dominican have been cancelled !From where please?
"Is it typical for resorts to give you a refund on the deposit? We've paid 50% and didn't buy insurance. Hate to lose out on that, but also don't want to be stuck there."
"Good morning and better yet...good news!Last night Maria did what I was hoping she would do! She moved further north, thus putting us on the cold air return side.This is a much easier ride. Both the American and European models more or less are in agreement.It also means that she would have the highest points in Puerto Rico to contend with, which should cause her some pain (as well as those living in Puerto Rico).We are certainly not out of the woods, but that shift to the right was definitely an improvement...a shift south would be a major blow to us.CheersPuntaCanaMike"
"Rob...I would contact the resort directly, as different companies have different policies.CheersPCMike"
"It was posted on the Varadero forum, my apologies . I looked on AC, dont see it."
"Thanks Mike. Where are you tracking the models, out of interest? The NHC 'line' is rather vague in their cone, and it would be good to see the various models (so many spaghetti lines out there)!"
But it doesnt look good.
"Dear PuntaCanaMike,for me you are a great man. thanks again that you give us as goodeven better information as for Irma.thanks alot in advance. i am going to watch this threat because of youandreas germany"
thanks!
Merci Mike For your information i am so worry but Still pray
I'm headed to Puerto Plata Oct 7. I'll be watching your posts! Keep me updated!
"Flying to Dominican Republic on Thursday 21st from Manchester UK landing about 5pm DR time , do you think this flight will be canceled?"
"@oleary123722 - I think, as a precautionary measure, they will probably change your Thursday flight, as it is scheduled in the middle of the storm. What Thomson did with Irma was simply delay flights by 24 or 48 hours, depending on the timing. BUT, we don't know how things will pan out with damage and timing, so keep an eye out on the airline website."
"As I mentioned, we are not yet out of the woods, but yesterdays tracking models had literally a dead hit on Punta Cana. Now the eye is expected to pass about 50 miles to the northeast. The wind predictions for here (as of now), are around 58 knots with higher gusts, which is like a strong tropical storm or Cat 1. That is enough to do damage to poorly built structures, poorly rooted trees and signs. Of course...all of this can change....the reason why I earlier mentioned that later on Tuesday we will have a much clearer idea of track and forecast."
Thank you for the update Mike.....much appreciated.@ oleary123722I too travel from Manchester on Thursday. I suspect they will do what they did with Irma and delay the flight by 24 hours if they are able.
"Thanks,We are flying with Thomas Cook no updates on there site as of yet, but will just keep an eye out.I have rang them and they are waiting on updates them selves but up to now we are still flying"
Obviously they won't fly if there are any safety issues. Bearing in mind the flight duration they need to know conditions are safe before the takeoff. It's cheaper for them to postpone for a couple of days like they did for Cuba earlier this month.
Saw that some Air Canada flights already cancelled on a PP thread.
Yes they have. Air Canada cancelled all flights to Punta Cana through the 23rd. Just waiting for Sunwing to follow suit and get our travel credit to go sometime in the new year.
Hopefully Sunwing doesn't wait at the last minute. Guess it is better to act now then go through a mandatory evac.
They've learned their lesson after Cuba. TC got a terrible press for late evacuation when the tourists returned.
i am i. Dominican Republic at one of the resorts. it was a tough decision to travel. we have plans to depart on Thursday. i am hoping we get to depart before the hurricane is impactful. the other person is correct. we should not make travel arrangements during hurricane seasons. this is my first and last time doing this. now that i'm here the resort is lovely but the fear of the next couple of days is concerning.
cnn.com/2017/…index.htmlThat looks a little to close for my liking. Sunwing is very disorganized and hard to work with.
"I am looking at wave action for early Thursday morning. This will be out biggest issue, as wave heights will average 13 to 15 feet from Cabo Engano through Uvero Alto, with the largest being in Uvero Alto. That area cannot handle a high surge as it is barely above sea level and behind the resorts is a natural lagoon."
"Oh man, I should have known better. My JetBlue flight is supposed to arrive PC at midday on Thursday 21st. I was focusing on Hurricane Jose interrupting my plans (departure) and didn't notice Maria forming. JetBlue is offering a waiver but I bought my online reservation ticket since May for Paradisus... I'm screwed. It looks like Maria will increase in categories quickly... when we first heard about it she was 75mph last night!!"
Mike - Do the coral off the cost on the Bavaro section limit the wave action on the beach and into the resorts?
Im also due to be on this flight...thomson been no help so far
Perdella - Your flight will be canceled on Thursday. Weather Channel has the center right not passing just north as a Cat 4 https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hu…1. I would just have a plan in place. You could try and get on an earlier flight. Since all the airlines are waving change fees you can do that now.2. If you decide to ride out the storm.. Remember that you could be down there for days extra not because of just the storm but with the airlines cancelling flights that will put you on the next open one which might not be the very next day.3. Check and see what credit card you used to book the flight. Many credit cards have travel insurance to cover you. The hotel still might charge you extra days and it would be nice to know if you credit card will pick up the cost of expenses.. Chase Reserve is one of the best.
Hello!! We are planning on flying to Punta Cana Wednesday for a week! what are your thoughts? What would advise?
"As of this morning, You are very lucky that JET BLUE is offering a waiver, so is Air Canada. I was supposed to fly out this AM with Sunwing, their flights are still going, I opted to cancel myself and they offered no options for me, but we don't want the stress of going there at this time. We are dissappointed in Sunwingl"

"Hey, Mike! Thanks for being our guru there! I follow your detailed comments every day.Just a quick question. I'm seeing that Maria is taking a very similar path to Irma. Still, you remark the importance of waves and flooding in this particular case. Shouldn't be expecting similar consequences to those which followed Irma (little to none)? What would be the difference this time?Thanks!"
"I am in same boat, supposed to fly out this 6:45 AM, but we took the decision not to go. Sunwing could care less.I will never use them again."
"PC Mike. I am supposed to be arriving there with my new wife a week from today. I know the storm will have passed by then, but what do you think the lasting effects of this storm could be? If the 13-15 foot surge hits, how long till the water resides and things get back to normal? When Irma came through other islands were predicting to be out of power for weeks or even months. Is there an idea of how long power may be out for?"
Maria is tracking more west than Irma did in hurricane terms 25miles can and usually is a big differenceEdited: 2 years ago 
Sorry if this is a stupid question...but is tracking more west a good thing or bad?
We all better start praying for everyone affected by this storm. Prayers go a long way people! The guy up in the Heavens listens!Just have Faith and trust in Him!Edited: 2 years ago 
I'm not sure what tracking West actually means. The storm has always expected to track West. We want the storm to track North to move further away from the island.
"Irma was already higher (north) than Maria and took a more westerly run. She passed us (the eye) approx 80 miles away. Maria is more northwest which means we will feel more of her north side of rotation initially Wednesday night and Thursday morning. This will increase wave size. As for the reef in Bavaro...yes...it will break the waves down somewhat. Anywhere from Royalton north, will have stronger wave action on the beaches. The east and north quadrant is the strongest. Irma was west and south side.At present Maria's major winds reach out 15 miles from the eye (65mph or stronger) in all directions. The eye is forecasted (subject to change) to pass 50 miles off to the northeast...as mentioned before...better to pass to the north than to pass to the south."
Maria is starting to track a little more to the north each day. http://spaghettimodels.com/ This is a good page for updated tracking and models.
"Mike, what do you think about Bavaro beach during this storm. I am set to get married at Majestic Mirage on Saturday...we fly tomorrow with about 45 guests arriving Wed and Thurs. They haven't cancelled our flights, but now I want them to."
"@PuntaCanaMike - Many thanks for your invaluable information, always much appreciated. As you are near the airport - should the storm go as predicted, 50miles north - is the airport in any particularly exposed or flood-prone areas which could close it for some time? The reason I ask is, I am due to fly in on Friday 2.30pm - and trying to see what the chances are that things might be up and running by then.. (if my airline doesn't decide to postpone - the UK flights tend to delay rather than cancel)."
"@CURTIS S - let's hope that northern tendency continues - some models show it missing Puerto Rico too - I hope it passes through the gap to the east of PR, sparing them, and so stays clear of the DR also. Oddly, most models are edging towards the UK Met Office tracker.. fingers crossed it's most accurate!Edited: 2 years ago "
"Mindy...congrats on your upcoming wedding! Unfortunately Maria might crash your party. I personally would keep in touch with the wedding planner at Majestic as to their thoughts. At this time, it is too early to say anything with certainty.CheersPCMike"
"Thanks Mike, I am trying, however I am getting radio silence from the resort and have been all weekend. Thanks again!"
"Mindy...tomorrow should be decision day. If Maria edges a bit more to the right of her path, that will improve our odds."
I have asked the same questions not really got a reply to those questions
You should call again I was suppose to be on that flight also and I was told people flying from the 18-22 have the option of changing dates or destinations or getting a voucher. I cancelled last night and got vouchers for the amount I paid even for my travel insurance!
"Donna, I have PM'd you.As for what happens in the case of a hurricane, tour companies do their best to control the number of people affected. For those on the ground, most are told to follow instructions as set out by each resort. Many have a secure area to house those in vulnerable rooms, such as ground level rooms or oceanfront rooms. Many of the newer resorts here are built to hurricane standards. Those that are more vulnerable are evacuated and guests taken to more secure resorts.Which resort is your daughter staying at?CheersPCMike"
Just looked at the latest projections and they think it Puerto rico will take a direct hit for the first time since 1998 but it does look as if it will track north of Dominican but this is a projection but fingers crossed for DR that this is the case but bless those poor souls in PR.
"Mike, how is Gran Bahia Ambar ? they built for hurricane?"
What a downer! Set to fly in on Saturday and not really sure what to do. I ordered through Cheapcarribean so I hope they have a good policy. I have already reached out to them and just waiting to hear back on what my options are. Has anyone else ordered through that site and been able to reschedule or get refunded? I purchased my flights and hotel through them. Was set for 9 day honeymoon. Bummer!Only thing we can do is keep an eye on it and see where it trends but my wife is already scared so we may just cancel if they allow it...
Even more reason to cancel....Every day in the 10 day forecast for our trip calls for rain :/
"Mathew BJust hold off and see what happens over next 2 days , we are also set for saturday but at present have no intention of cancelling , just keep watching the updates , We may get 1 day delay but also like Irma all may be ok , just have to see"
Mathew B Ignor the forecast it always says rain but that may mean a shower in the evening lol but hot and sunny all day
"Bahia Ambar is a newer resort and is built to standards. In any resort, regardless, they will vacate all vulnerable rooms, thus if you are enjoying the oceanview this morning (perfect day today), you will likely move out of that room Wednesday morning."
Thanks for the reply Rushden!I think I will hold off and see how it trends. Normally I would be fine but my wife is about to have a heart attack reading the reports lol...She wanted me to cancel last week during Irma and we weren't even traveling yet!
"Matthew, I would call your resort and see what hurricane policy they have. Secrets gave us multiple options in case of the resort is impacted"
Keep watching PCMIKES updates as he is a true gent and his info is from PC itself and he has a lot of valuable info.As it is stating it looks like taking a northern track so could miss 50 or 60 miles to the north but early days yet
Who did you book your travel with?
"I should mention yet again...as scary as wind can be, it is rainfall we should be most concerned with. One forecast I just looked at calls for 13 inches of rain over a 24 hour period (Wednesday through Thursday). This will cause widespread flooding of resorts and communities (mine included). With such flat land, the waters do not run off too quickly. This also affects transportation of goods and people.I think I will invest in some sand bags this afternoon.CheersPCMike"
Mathew BThats's funny as my wife is insistant that we are going on our holiday/vacation lol and it is me doing all the tracking research etc .She is not a bit worried as is looking forward to her holiday lol
"I'm flying out on the 22nd, I expect my fight to be cancelled but hoping for the best. Might just change Islands and go to Jamaica! But will know more tomorrow or Wednesday."
Make sure you stock up on a few bottles of Rum too while you get your sandbags lol
Sunwing Confirmed same to me
Still trying to lighten the cabinet from Irma's rum provisioning!
"Mike, what are your thoughts about a Tomorrow midday arrival? It doesn't look like United or the Hard Rock will be issuing any changes/cancellations since it is too soon before the storm. Do you suggest rolling the dice and come join you guys in Punta Cana, or cancel and face huge penalty charges and lose out on all that money? (learned the hard way for opting out of insurance)Also, according to the forcast, do you think the hard rock would evacuate or shelter folks? Or would we be okay to stay in our rooms for the duration of maria. Your thoughts and insights are appreciated as always."
"Hey Mike! My name is aurora and just concerned as we are arriving Thursday. I'm trying to stay optimistic as my group is a little scared. We are arriving Thursday and staying a week. I don't want to miss out on anything if the rain is only going to be a day or two. We are staying at the riu republic,from your knowledge does that hotel have a good hurricane system in place where we would be safe inside the resort? Anything you can help with would be greatly appreciated. We are just a couple of concerned travelers. Thank you!"
PC Mike oh my all that rainfall will cause damage with flooding... plus the wind.. Scary situation.. Are people in your community starting to prepare?? Evacuation orders as of yet? Stay Safe!!! I am still hoping she shifts more out to sea... Angie
I know for a lot of people it can be a worrying time but don't go cancelling in haste as it could miss altogether but if it does affect the island with local flooding then you can always see if your provider will delay by a couple of days etc.A lot of folks cancelled before Irma hit and yet we had friends who was in there room for about 10 hours but next day was back in the pool enjoying the holiday.For a lot of us it has cost us a lot of hard earned bucks so i for one not gonna throw it away on a whim.So sit tight read and listen to PC MIKES updates and lets see what happens over next 48 hours.
"I'm also on that flight from Manchester on Thursday, so far flight is still going"
"""Are people in your community starting to prepare??""To be perfectly honest??? If they are it is barely noticeable. We tend to get things done at the last minute here.Monday is my normal shopping day and I may restock on some items, but we still have a ton of non perishables from Irma's visit. I will fill up the gas tank on Wednesday.But today...picture perfect day with tons of sunshine.CheersPCMike"
Am flying out Thursday from Manchester I spoke 2 Thomson b4 and as it stands the flight is going ahead at the moment but they said keep a eye on yer emails as it could change at anytime fingers crossed
732conniekYep keep those prayers going and fingers crossed you and your kids will have the holiday to remember and everyone can enjoy it like they should.Here'e hoping my friendJon
"The National Hurricane center just updated the chart at 11am and right now I don't know if its better or worst yet. All I know is that the winds are now 120mph at the moment, which increased from 8am."
The updated track has more or less stayed the same. The eye is predicted 48 mikes to our northeast....previously 50 miles.CheersPCMike
"One must understand,,,that the winds noted are near the eyewall in the Northeast quadrant"
"PC Mike, thanks for all your comments! we are a family of 4, 2 toddlers (3 and 2 year old), staying at Now Larimar. Our flight back to Montreal is on Sunday 24th but Air Canada canceled every flight until sunday... I dont know if I should buy a ticket for tomorrow with Westjet or see what happens... At the resort, the locals are very calm, saying ""no va pasar nada!"" and at this point I dont know what to do or expect... any input? Thanks! Daniela"
"Hi PC Mike, I'm in Punta cana now. Our flight is at 125pm on Wednesday to Pennsylvania. Do you think it will be delayed?(Do you think we will be stuck here?) Please respond. My boyfriend is extremely worried. He's scared we will be stuck here."
"The Euro model takes it right over Punta Cana, isn't that one the most accurate? I could be way off just hoping it misses everyone there."
"Wednesday's flights should be fine. The planes coming in will likely be light loads, but going back home full.Cheers PCMike"
Travelling to PC (Dreams Palm Beach) on Tuesday 26th for 2 weeks & by the sounds of it we've been quite fortunate with the timing after seeing what's happened the past couple weeks. It's a dream holiday for us & we've been looking forward to it for months so desperately hoping a third/fourth hurricane doesn't materialise!Feels like there are some contributors scaremongering on other threads & particuarly re. 'not booking' during hurricane season - it's June 1st through end of November (with some even building in May!) that's hardly a small window! There are risks to travelling anywhere at any time of year and these comments seem unhelpful. Thanks PC Mike for your insight - very interesting & fingers crossed for everybody travelling!
FYI...we have not had a direct hit in Punta cana since 2004....13 years without a hurricane hitting us. All have brushed by us since then.CheersPCM
"Just got off the phone with Air Transat and as of now all flights are still scheduled to fly into Punta Cana, Thursday September 21st from Toronto. They will be calling all passengers if anything changes, fingers crossed. We are booked from the 21st-28th at Vik Arena Blanca, Punta Cana. They didn't give my any information on what will happen if they end up cancelling flights. We didn't get travel insurance, so we're really hoping nothing happens."
"Hello all,Thank you Mike for keeping all of us nervous travelers up to date! I received a message from the Embassy this morning which had little to no useful information, so your responses and attention are definitely appreciated. Is the Now Larimore a well-equipped resort to deal with these kinds of problems? You mentioned that newer resorts were well-built and prepared, so I am wondering if the Now falls into that category.We are scheduled to fly out on the 25th of September, and right now we are assuming the worst will have passed by then. I will be coming back here every 5 minutes to check on the status of PC and surrounding areas."
"I was working at Now as it got built. It is, like most others, built to standards. Now, this does not mean that nothing could happen, but structurally, they have built with extra reinforcements. They also have a large convention center that can be used as an evacuation point if required.CheersPCMike"
"Mike I am due to arrive wed at 1:00 heading to Bahia Principe. Very happy to hear it is a new ""strong"" resort. What are thoughts on our being able to land and get in before the worst hits. Thank you for all your updates!!!!"
How is ocean blue built structurally?
"Daniela you do NOT want to be in a storm or even sometimes worse the aftermath of a storm like this with toddlers. Get out now and forget about the extra cost. Even if the eye passes 50 miles to the north of PC, with the main force being forecast to now be 145mph, in PC you would be looking at gusts that could be hitting 100mph occasionally and with a lot of rain. Power will be out which means air conditioning will be out. AM resorts typically are very organized and good but as they did during Irma, they likely will bus you inland to some place to sit out the storm. It won't be fun in a shelter with your toddlers with many other people. And afterward there will be such a crush of people trying to all fly home as quickly as possible that you may be stuck for a few to several days before you get out. We had friends with toddlers caught in Cabo by Odlile in Sept 2014 and while the planes brought in by the Mexican military a few days after took the mothers and children and elderly out first, they still had 2 very uncomfortable days and nights with no power and no AC and sub standard food with kids who were scared and hard to keep calm. Go home now and don't even think about the cost or the loss of some days of holiday. If it were just you and your husband, ok, maybe you could ride it out and deal with what hardship there could be, but you do not want to chance that with a 2 and 3 yr old."
Punta Cana Mike...thank you so much for your patience answering everyone's questions from last week's weather and now this week's weather. I am visiting September 26 and am hopeful everyone is safe after this week.
"Thanks or all your feedback and advice PCMIKE, I am travelling there on September 30th staying at Majestic Elegance. Your personal opinion, do you think I will miss hurricane Maria all together? I am assuming this hotel is built to standards? I am contemplating cancelling my trip and need to decide right away, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am more worried about damage/flooding/no power. I think when I get there the hurricane would of passed.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Tww makes a good point. Often the hardship is not the storm itself, but the after effects. As I mentioned earlier, rainfall is my biggest concern. The sun might be shining a day after, but having to wade through knee deep water to go to the beach is not my idea of fun!As for power, most resorts have back-up power sources.Anyone who chooses to ride out a hurricane has to accept the inconveniences...not beech and whine about it after."
"""Your personal opinion, do you think I will miss hurricane Maria all together?""Straight up....no. Maria will cause us some problems. We will have to wait and see.CheersPCMike"
Family vacation to Punta Cana Sept 24 for a week. Keeping an eye.
I remember the 2004 hurricane. It did a huge amount of damage to Excellence. They had to evacuate guests out by helicopters. I went there about 10 or 12 days after that and you couldn't tell anything was different except for some shrubs and trees gone. I did take malaria tablets for the only time due to standing water.
"""Often the hardship is not the storm itself, but the after effects. As I mentioned earlier, rainfall is my biggest concern""That was certainly a big issue when we were the Melia Tropical Caribe when Jeanne hit as to get in and out of our building for the first couple of days we had to wade through water"
Hurricane season is 6 months long
And your point Tom?
Air Canada has canceled all flight to DR until Sunday.
Nothing has been cancelled as yet from the UK so we are just keeping everythig crossed. I popped into my local Thomson office for a chat and they said just keep an eye on the website updates ( at present still showing Irma lol)As mike has stated it's more about the flooding this time around so i think the next 36 to 48 hours are crucial to knowing a bit more about the exact path she is taking
"""Air Canada has canceled all flight to DR until Sunday"" What about folks currently there? I'm guessing some will see their trips cut short and be sent home early."
Thanks for all the updates/information PC Mike! Set to arrive for my honeymoon on 9/25/17 and stay for a week. We will definitely be on the lookout for the weather and keep you and everyone in our thoughts! Hope you all stay safe and encounter minimal damage!
Air Canada from Toronto has not cancelled all their flights until Sunday.They have only cancelled for the 18th and 19th.Those flying between the 18th and 24th have the option of rebooking but the flights are not cancelled.Renee3074 are you talking about just flights from Ottawa?
"I am on the flight from Manchester on Thursday, just spoken to Thomson and they've told me there's currently a meeting going on to decide what the plan is with regards to who's being cancelled! Updates are apparently on the website."
"Airlines, quite correctly, won't take any risks or compromise passenger safety."
Traveling to Grand Sirenis in Punta Cana on Wednesday 9/20/17. How concerned should we be. I don't mind some inconveniences just wondering if anyone knows how well built our resort is or how they fare during hurricanes
"Dave, I am in the same situation with work and vacation bidding and seniority.. We leave on Oct 7th to Punta Cana, and regardless of the weather I am looking forward to it! And you are right in the comment of ""experience a hurricane"".. every day can be an adventure, as long as you are prepared and safe! Enjoy your trip!"
If things are really bad the flight will be postponed/cancelled. If the hotel is damaged they won't take guests.
229JennyJust checked both Thomson and First choice but no updates as of yet
"Rochelle...Sirenis is a resort that could be easily affected by flooding and high surf, as it is in Uvero Alto. Uvero Alto is basically built on a sand bar between the ocean and the rice fields to the west of the resort (rice fields should give you an idea of low lying areas). You will still have high surf to deal with...if no rain.Too early to make that call. As long as we stay west of the eye, we will stay on the drier side of the rotation.CheersPCMikeEdited: 2 years ago "
"Hey, Mike! Is TRS Turquesa by Palladium a safe, well built resort?Thanks!"
"Any ideas about how safe is Sunscape Beach Bavaro? We should arrive on 25th Sept for our honeymoon. We're coming from Romania, so any news will help. Thanks!"
I really wanna know as I wanna get out of here and Expedia os not giving me options unless stay until sunday 24th which is my original day.
"I cannot go into detail about each resort, as it would be never ending. Both resorts are protected by a barrier reef that provides some relief from the surf. Both have protocols in place as to anything like a hurricane.CheersPCMike"
"I meant, I wanna know if Air Canada will be having flight available to take people out before Thursday...."
"Pim...there is no definitive answer at this time, thus my comment before that we have to wait until later Tuesday to get a clearer picture.PCMIke"
"Hello, Mike. What do you think about hotel Ocean blue and sand in Punta Cana, Is this place is safety? Thanks for your help :) BR, Damian"
Hi @ PCMike. Wife and I are set to depart tomorrow morning for Breathless in Punta Cana. Any thoughts as to the resorts preparedness and geographical protections?
"British Airways have cancelled their London Gatwick flight on Thursday flight to Punta Cana, which means I'm not going :(Wish someone told me before about hurricane season....one for the lessons book."
British Airways just informed me via text message our flight on Thursday (BA 2205 from Gatwick) has been cancelled. Waiting on hold with them to find out if it will be moved to another day or cancelled all together.
"I'm going to wait until tomorrow to see if I'm going to cancel and reschedule for November. Sucks, I really need a vacation!"
"We gonna wait till it's been and gone but at this moment have no plans to cancel , it's just a waiting game .To many panicked before Irma and lost there holidays when no damage was done."
Hi @PCMike. Set to arrive tomorrow 9/19 around 12:30 to the Catalonia Royal Bavaro. Hoping they have a good plan for their guests. What do you expect the turn around to be if the areas do get flooded? Super anxious and also family is a bit on edge about us departing. Thanks!Edited: 2 years ago 
Guys and girls...off the forum for a few hours.More later.CheersPCMike
"Hello @ PCMike.You should be paid for such ammount of information and patience :-)Admire your work here in forum, and your sence of humor :-DHave fingers crossed and send my prayers for you Mike and everybody on the caribbean islands to stay safe."
I got trip insurance so one way or another I will get a vacation at some point!
Sunwing has also suspended flights to PP and PC until Sept 22nd
"Hurricane map has been updated on the Nation Hurricane Center website. Same path, just a bit stronger. Oh well.... time to start thinking of Alternate plans. Has anyone heard any word from their resort yet? I called Melia (booked The reserve Paradisus Palma Real for Thursday), a rep told me they're discussing what should be done but she has no directions as of yet. Hopefully, I will be able to fly to another country instead.... We both took the time off and can't afford to take time off work any other time this year.Stay safe everyone & good luck!"
"First trip Cuba , cayo santa maria cancelled , now booked to punta cana another hurricane . leaving Sept 23 what luck ."
OMG Mike you have the patience like no other. Can't some of you posters READ. Almost all the same questions over and over again. Start at the beginning and read the thread. It is so annoying!!!
Due to fly out from Manchester on 25th and keeping a close eye on Maria trackers. No updates on Thomson website as of yet. It's a waiting game for now I guess...
"I am Sirenis Premium Traveler member. I contacted Sirenis about changes to our reservation if we cannot fly into Punta Cana. I was advised that I would be offered no refund which I expected but that they would not even flex my arrival and departure dates even if the airline won't fly into the country. As a member I am very confused and disappointed. I am paying an all inclusive fee to cover food and beverage expenses. If I'm not there and no one else can get there because of a hurricane why would I be charged? I requested that if an airline can't get there till three days after our scheduled arrival then could we stay three days at the end. Keeping in mind this is NOT a busy travel time. I was told NO....NO ??? This is how Sirenis Premium Travel Club treats it's members? What's the point in being member???? I have travel on two other occasions where weather impacted our arrival and departure dates in each case I was NOT charged any fee and the resorts quickly changed my dates. In one case we had to change the dates three times as the airline continued to change the date we could fly. Now I wasn't even a member at these places. Apparently Sirenis Premium Travelers Club isn't so ""Premium"" This is our 20th Wedding Anniversary slated to be ruined by Hurricane Maria and the poor customer service at Sirenis Premium Travelers Club. It's my hopes that someone from Sirenis will come to their senses and provide ""customer service "" to their members"
"carol97I could not agree more , same question over and over again . If people read before they would see what has been posted"
We are booked with Sunwing for Sept 21 and have not heard anything from them & have been unable to get thru to them. Can you tell me how you received this information?
"Hey, could you please keep me updated when Maria arrives?"
"Hi I'm going to Punta Cana on Wednesday, 9/20/17 flying out of Philly....keeping a close eye out...very nervious"
"RaiRai - I am not sure which airline you are booked on .. But, I know Jetblue with Irma was allowing people to change their destination with no additional charge even if the airfare was more. I rebooked friends from St. Martin to Aruba for the same time period no additional fees."
Hey mragheno. I think Maria is arriving on Thursday but she is not all inclusive so therefore she is not staying around and packing her bags by Friday and leaving. Hopefully she is a good mood and will not leave a flood of tears behind.I for one will be glad to see the back of her before we fly in on Saturday.Cheers Foxy
"Hi @GoGiantsfan11, I'm booked with JetBlue, using points & they still offered to change our flight. I was notified since yesterday night that my flight changes or cancellations would be waived. I'm just waiting on Melia to know where we can switch to and then, JetBlue has agreed to change our flights with no issue. My only problem is that the mister really wants to go to PC, and I really don't care to go to Mexico! Hence the reason we're here... constantly watching the hurricane weather and trip advisor updates!Hopefully Maria will realized that Irma took all the titles for Caribbean Storm 2017, and will leave us all alone!"
"all info posted on Sunwing website - all flights to DR suspended until 22nd, they offer an options to re-book with new dates or new destination , or offer a full refund. I contacted them this morning and re-booked with no issues, as my flight was on Sep 20 to Punta cana."
"We are a group of 6 flying out on the 25th with Sunwing staying at the Riu Republica, we are all hoping for the best and know it will be a great vacation."
RaiRai - I hope it works out for you! If you did not want to go to Mexico.. You could check which credit card co you used to charged your hotel part on. Some of them gave great travel insurance that will give you your money back.. Then just use your Jetblue tickets to go where ever you want..:)
"We were schedule to fly out 9/21(since Maria is supposed to ""hit"" Thursday i doubt there will be any flights going out. I've had to reschedule twice one because of Harvey then Irma and now Maria. As much as i would like to visit the Caribbean i'm over the uncertainty. I'ts not meant for us this year :("
We have plans to arrive on the 28Th for our vacation and staying at Secrets.Sending good vibes! Thanks for all the updates and advice
"Yep @GoGiantsfan11, I've already called the Chase Reserve department and notified them of JetBlue's travel alert. I'll get my points back for my flight if I cancel and I'm protected with built in insurance too on the resort end. If I can't get a good option for swapping from the resort, then I'll just get a refund and let Chase/Visa Infinite deal with Melia. But we really don't want a refund. We bought our tickets since May.... chose PC over Morocco simply because we wanted to relax after a long and tiring summer. We're running on empty.. we don't want a refund.. we want Maria to leave the Caribbean so we can Relax! Lol."
"Hi Mike, I'm flying to PC on Sep. 30th. What do you think are the odds of everything being ""normal"" by then in terms of touristic activity? (power, airport, resort damage -Bavaro-). Do you think I should re-book? Thank you!"
"After deliberating over whether to stay or go during the last few days, we've decided to get a flight with Air Europa tomorrow back to the UK via Madrid, as our flight to Manchester will most certainly be delayed for at least a day whilst Maria passes.I also wanted to thank PC Mike especially, for your well considered opinions & comment; local info is king!Stay save everybody. Better to be prepared. We had people here when Irma was looming & the response seemed to be a little slow, even if that was with the best of intention to avoid panicking people."
RaiRai- Love my Reserve card and my jetblue points too!.. Hoping for the best for you guys. Have you considered another island so you can still leave this week?
@PuntaCanaMike Hey Guys. My flight is going to be on September 29. Do you guys think everything is going to be ok by then?Edited: 2 years ago 
Wow - seeing that Sunwing and AC have already cancelled.. and Transat is still monitoring the situation (they were the first to cancel/rebook with Irma). Hoping for all the best - thankfully we purchased Options Plus and are already looking to switch over to Mexico. Too bad Jamaica is all booked up this week!
I fly out to PC as well on Sept. 30th. This too shall pass!
"We are scheduled to fly out of Baltimore on Saturday 9/23... hoping all is well, as American has not cancelled any flights. *fingers crossed*"
"Hello PC MIKE, We are travelling to Paradisus Punta Cana on September/22 and stay for one week. In your opinions, do you think this hotel is built to standards? I am more worried about damage/flooding/no power due to hurricane. Your advice would be greatly appreciated."
"Our flight Ts 481 on thursday 21 is on the fence now , i guess the final decision from Tansat will be on wednesday 20.This is an experimental model:http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at5+shtml/150535.shtml?mltoa34#contentsWe were delayed from Sept 7 departure , first time this arrived from 30 years experience ...life is made of surprises !"
Something for all of you to read and remain positive..reliable-realty-dr.com/PUNTA_CANA-_LOWEST_CH…
"I am scheduled to fly out of Newark tomorrow and united has still not cancelled. What are they waiting for? If I cancel I do not get a credit or refund, if they do I will. If the hurricane path does not change, the flight might still depart but I know that I will not be on it. Really didn't want to cancel but what choice at this point do I have. Here's hoping by some miracle Maria turns north,tropical storm I can handle, category 4, I don't think so"
"Natalia, where do you see ""full refund"". I don't see this anywhere on their site. Can you provide link?"
"Hey everyone...back from picking up the girls at school and Monday grocery shopping.Like Irma before, when I went shopping today, there were about 20 people in a large supermarket. There is no shortage of whatever your heart desires. No waiting at the cash register for 1 hour. No fights in the aisle for anything. I compare what I see here to what I see on TV back home and it makes me realize very clearly, that in the islands, we do it differently. No panic.I just took a look at the latest update and Maria is being a good girl and moving further east on her track. Her closest point is now almost 60 miles to the northeast...almost exactly where Irma passed us.Tropical storm force winds remain a high probability, but 50 mile and above are at 50% chance and hurricane strength....only 30 to 40%.As I have mentioned earlier, given her forecast track (NOAA), she will leave us on the cold air side of the rotation. Less rain and less wind.The troubling projection is from the European model which shows Maria bouncing off the south of Puerto Rico and heading directly for us. All other models contradict this.So, basically, no change today. Once she breaks free of the Lesser Antilles and has some breathing space, we should see what she has planned for the next few days.CheersPCMike"
"For clarity, I am still very concerned about Maria and taking her very seriously for the local region. Still 24 hours too early to make a call on her."
"@PuntaCanaMike - I think you might still be seeing the morning's European model, the next one (updated 19:15 UCT) now has Maria east of Punta Cana - still closer than others, but no longer a hit. Unless I am looking at it wrong?https:/…20170921-1800z.html"
Thanks Seb...Tidbits was still using the old model! Good eye!
Hope its ok by October 7th!!! You were so helpful last hurricane I'm searching you again. Going to dream spa resort in Punta cana. Praying it misses!!!
"I don't know if this helps for Canadians there but I see AC and sunwing on their sites are coordinating to pick up prior to Thursday, not sure about WestJet and Air Transit yet."
will be watching closely and waiting for your updates. we are to be in Punta cana on October 13th. Thanks Mike!
"It is the Leafs first preseason game tonight, so my mind might drift a little away from hurricanes.CheersPCMike"
"""I am scheduled to fly out of Newark tomorrow and united has still not cancelled. What are they waiting for?""In many cases, they wait for a Hurricane Warning to be issued. Unfortunstely, that's only 24-36 hours prior to when hurricane force winds are expected to impact the island.Read the posts though between yours and this one. The storm may not impact Punta Cana as was the case in the worst case scenario."
"Hey PC Mike, I saw this on twitter. Are we in this path or just in the outskirts of it #DominicanRepublic: avoid all travel between Isla Saona and Puerto Plata due to Hurricane #Maria. ow.ly/Dr4M30ffGMF"
We are supposed to be arriving in Punta Cana on September 29 for our honeymoon. Hoping Maria shifts north.
We are supposed to be arriving in Punta Cana on the 29th for our honeymoon. We are really hoping Maria shifts North.
"Suger...that came out this afternoon by email to all Canadians registered with Canadians Abroad in the Dominican Republic. It should qualify itself a little better by stating a date, such as Wednesday afternoon.With any major hurricane or other natural disaster or state of internal affairs, they send out a notice.This is the ""meat"" of the email sent...Global Affairs Canada advises against all travel to the region due to the approaching Hurricane Maria. Leave by commercial means while they are still available and if it is safe to do so. For more information, please check the Natural disasters and climate section on our Travel Report and Advisory (https:/…dominican-republic) and our page on Hurricanes Irma and Maria (https:/…hurricane-irma).The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency and various local governments are issuing advisories for Hurricane MARIA. As changes to the forecast and local conditions are continuous, Canadians should visit www.cdema.org or www.nhc.noaa.gov for the latest updates.Canadians residing in or travelling to the affected areas should monitor local news and weather reports, follow the advice of local authorities, and contact their travel agent or tour operator to determine whether the situation will disrupt their travel arrangements.A hurricane/storm preparedness plan includes three basic elements that are important in the threat of any severe weather event:1) Maintain a disaster or emergency supply kit;2) Secure your home and property; and3) Have a safe place to go in the event of an evacuation or prolonged utility outage.A similar notification came out for Irma.CheersPCMike"
"BTW...I am part of a system put in place by the Canadian Embassy to assist those who are living here (Canadians) and registered with the program. I only get the call if things get bad. So far in 5 years of volunteering, I have yet to get a call. Let us hope for another 5 years!PCMike"
I am curious....I have someone telling me that they have a friend staying at Bavaro Princess and that guests just received a letter telling them they should evacuate before Thursday. I finding this interesting....you have flights still scheduled to go to Punta Cana tomorrow. Anyone at Bavaro Princess who can confirm this?
"Another point...if you decide to ride out the storm and it gets really bad, your government does not give you a ""FREE RIDE"" out. You have to pay for that service. This from the Canadian government...""If you receive evacuation assistance from the Government of Canada, you will receive an invoice for the cost, which must be paid within 30 days. You are also responsible for paying for your travel beyond a safe location and any related costs.""Trust me...if you think a commercial flight is expensive...just wait until you see the bill from being airlifted out!CheersPCMike"
"Yes! Let's hope they don't call! Thanks for everything, I'm here till Friday (hopefully). But I guess we'll know more tomorrow and Wednesday. I heard PUJ is closing Thursday (got that info from my sunwing rep here at the resort) so it'll complete chaos at the airport Friday."
"We are going December 16-23-2017, will hurricane's be done by then? We are hoping Dominican Republic will not be hit so hard at the resorts and the airport."
"Thank you for your very informative updates.My husband and I have been vacationing for around 12 years to the dominican as we enjoy the great,loving , relaxed atmosphere and also celebrating our anniversaries and his birthday every October....We will be arriving on October 3rd hopefully to once again enjoy the very special second home aswe call it at the lovely Iberostar HD....We adopted our son from there 10 years ago and love him somuch..he lives and works in Punta Cana so we can't wait to see him soon....We are divers/snorkelors.We pray that the weather will be safe for all and all the vacationers......USA Michiganders"
"@ Elieen D, call back Sunwing, I did the same thing, I cancelled yesterday at 6pm, no insurance, my flight was due to leave this AM at 6:45. That flight did leave, I believe it was the last one out of MTL, There was no way I was getting on that flight this morning, after watching all the reports on Maria. I was peeved today when I see all the flights were cancelled to DR until Sept 24., so I just called them back, I was very nice and asked them if they could do something to help me because I lost $3000. They refunded all my money. So please call them, I am sure they will help you out."
Does anyone know if CYCLOCANE is a reliable source? They show all the spaghetti models going north of Punta Cana.
"Hi Everyone! Thank you for all valuable information. I have read all posts but I still have one question. What about La Romana (Dominicus Beach) area? Our flight is scheduled on 28th Sep with AirFrance to PC, than we have transfer to La Romana. Shall we worry about for example post- flooding / No electricity etc..? Will very much appreciate all replies. We are flying to DR for the first time."
"Just upgraded to a Cat 5, really hope the 2 am model shifts it North."
"Hi Taag,Suggest you wait a day or two for updated models. Things shifted today.http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at5+shtml/205325.shtml?cone#contents"
I am also wondering the same about La Romana as I am scheduled to land there on Saturday the 23 at 11:30 am. I am assuming this isn't going to happen
Mike...Leafs are losing 3-0 at the moment.
Ummmmm....well....you know! LOLDid you see the Dominican tourism ad between the blue lines?
"just call Sunwing - they stated about 3 options - changing dates, changing detinations or full refund. I noticed that ""full refund"" is not posted on website, you need to call. I did not have any issues with re-booking, we desided to change dates, hopefully it will be ok,,,:)"
Suppose to fly in on Wednesday for 7 days staying at Magestic Elegance..any advice?
I have a couple of family members there vacationing... I pray for their safety & your safety.
@taaga cześć. Spokojnie 24 września MARIA TAK JAK MOŻNA ZOBACZYĆ NA MODELACH będzie na wysokości Kuby lub wyżej. Do tego czas będziesz znała rozmiar ewentualnych zniszczeń. Pozdrawiam z la romana .my jesteśmy tu do 23.09....28.09 Marii juz nie będzie. ..jak juz to inny huragan ale nie maria
"Air Transat has cancelled all flights going to Dominican Republic up until the 22nd. We are supposed to leave the 21st for Punta Cana from Toronto so I'm guessing it's cancelled for us. Will be calling tomorrow for our options. We didn't pay for travel insurance, this is a nightmare"
Just checked. There is a travel advisory out for travel to North-East Dominican Republic.Also Westjet Advisory now changed to Sept 16 to Sept 25. Before it was Sept 16 to Sept 20.Please check it out.
PC Mike --what's the construction status of Sanctuary Cap Cana? Meets current hurricane standards or is older?
"this was posted by Sunwing about 2 hrs ago for those in Punta Cana. Please be safe. Important Update* As earlier advised, flight services into Punta Cana and Puerto Plata have been suspended until September 22nd. After reviewing the most up-to-date projections of Hurricane Maria’s path and strength, we have made the decision to activate our contingency plans and repatriate all passengers from the Dominican Republic in advance of the storm’s projected landfall. Please see updates below:- Customers scheduled to depart on the four Sunwing flights from Puerto Plata or Punta Cana on Tuesday, September 19th, will return to Canada as planned.- Customers scheduled to depart Punta Cana and return to Toronto on Wednesday, September 20th, will also return to Canada as planned.- We will be operating nine additional flights on Tuesday and Wednesday to repatriate all other customers ahead of the storm. Sunwing destination representatives will be in touch with all guests to confirm their flight details.We do not have any passengers in other destinations currently forecasted to be impacted, but continue to monitor the situation closely. The most up to date information regarding our flight schedules is available here: sunwing.ca/pages/en/flight-status-alerts."
"Hey PC MIKE!!! I have been reading the forums and am concerned. I'm expected to be there tomorrow afternoon for my wedding. Unfortunately, I received an email from the wedding planner at Excellence El Carmen that my wedding was cancelled due to hurricane Maria, but could reschedule on Monday while i'm there if there is no damage. Excellence El Carmen also posted a hurricane trip advisory - basically advising people to reschedule there trips. What is your outlook on this?"
"Karen, we are in the same boat. I am scheduled to leave tomorrow for 8 nights, I am not flying in tomorrow regardless of united's policy and no insurance, I am thinking about paying the waiver fee and fly in Friday, wishfully thinking and hoping it is not going to be too bad. Best case scenario' I'll be there for 5 days instead of 8, worst case I lose the waiver fee. Does that sound reasonable, or is it the rum?"
"Hi Marie...in between periods of a bad Leaf game....lolI have mentioned a few times now, that wind is not my concern. I am more concerned with rainfall and waves. Your resort is vulnerable to both, thus I think it is the right call. Even if Maria stays in her current position, she will affect some resorts."
"My husband and I are scheduled to arrive in Punta Cana at 6am tomorrow, Sept 19 and are staying at The Reserve at Reserve at Paradisus Palma Real for our honeymoon. Our travel company hasn’t heard if this hotel is allowing for cancellations, rescheduling, etc at this time. We are worried if we should even go, if we go we may be stuck in the hurricane, if we don’t go we may lose out the full amount of the trip."
"Thank you Mike! I appreciate your feedback. My travel planner is rescheduling me now. I think it's for the best. Although, I went and got married today so we could have the ceremony there.. Looks like the ceremony will just have to wait. It will be worth it to be able to come when the weather is not bad. Hopefully lee will be calm and not be a threat. Be safe!! Cheers!"
We are flying out in the 28th staying at Riu Republica as well. Fingers crossed Maria behaves!!
We are supposed to land in Punta Cana on Saturday for a week stay at the Breathless resort. Super sad about Maria. Debating if we should cancel or not. So far JetBlue has not canceled our flights. I know Maria is supposed to have passed but worried about the weather for our week stay.
We are in breathless now if u need any infk:)
"PCMike,I can't tell you how thankful we are to have you posting here. My fiancé and I are leaving for our honeymoon on Sunday and staying for 6 days at The Reserve at Paradisus Punta Cana. Any worries about that property? I'm been keeping an eye on things to see if by Wednesday there's a better idea of where Maria is going to go before we start looking into alternate destinations...Thanks again"
"Hi PC Mike, first of all your posts are great and super informative.I am currently in Punta Cana and while I have been following ms.Maria when I'm not at the pool, there has been no mention of it whatsoever by the resort (paradisus Punta cana reserve) and I guess I'm just wondering if that's standard resort behavior or if I should be more worried about things i.e. trying to find a flight out before our scheduled one on the 23rd. It's hard to gauge as I am in no way a hurricane expert and the weather at the moment, as you know, is exactly what I would expect in a tropical island. Any advice?"
"So we were hesitant before we booked because of Irma and Jose...I looked at the weather and the forums and it looked like we were in the clear. So, we booked and now hurricane Maria is hitting category 5??? I'm having my fingers crossed. Thank you for all the updates until now! I'm still keeping an eye on this forum before we make a decision to cancel!"
"For anyone who is concerned or worried...We were suppose to arrive in Punta Cana Friday morning but we changed our trip to a different destination. We were booked through Delta vacations and they confirmed with us that we could either cancel our trip completely and get a full refund (lose a little bit of money), change dates and/or change destinations. We chose another hotel and just paid the difference. We usually aren't scared off by storms, but the aftermath is why we made our decision. No electricity would be no fun regardless of who you are. I feel like we would be losing money in that scenario. Stay safe everyone! Hope this helps!"
We are scheduled to go on 23rd. Just spoke with my airline Westjet. They told me they not sure yet about our flight cancellation but upto 22nd all flight to DR are cancelled. They said extra planes are being sent to evacuate their guests vacationing in DR. Heard similar info from other Canadian airlines.
I don't know where the resorts are located but Excellence El Carmen in Punta Cana is worried about this one more than Irma. As PC Mike said the rain and waves are the issue more than anything. Excellence El Carmen posted a travel advisory on their Facebook page advising anyone who is traveling there to reschedule.
Cześć odpisałem Ci w którymś poście. 28 września MARII TO JUŻ NIE BĘDZIE. ..może jakiś nowy huragan ale nie maria. Popatrz sobie na modele w national hurricane center. Pozdrawiam hubert
Supposed to fly out to Punta cana tomm morning. we decieded to take advantage of jet blues deal and changed our trip to cancun. the flights are almost the same. we could not reschedule trip so this was a good option. good luck to everyone
I am sorry for your wedding disruption Marie. Things always work out for the best I think.
Did they charge you a fee? Just tried to do that with United and they want to charge $500
in punta cana at the moment. Meant to fly back home to london friday! Has anybody heard anything from thomson?? Every other airline seems to be sending people home! hellppp
"No fee, about $50 per person if you tried to cancel. We did not buy trip protection either."
Thomson is the worst at communication.Stay safe.
"If those that can cancel, I would cancel. It's not worth it. We just got back from Now Onyx earlier than usual because of a serious knee injury, but if it weren't for that, we would be cancelling. we watched IRMA, and didn't cancel because it went far north, this one doesn't look good. Who wants to be stuck in flooding and rains? You'll be missing out on vacation. We had rain for a few days here including rain all day one day, it sucked."
We were supposed to land in Punta Cana Sept 23 but cancelled due to the storm forecast. Lost a some money but worth the piece of mind for myself and travelling companions. Stay safe PC...Will return asap ❤️
Hey Summers45. Hope you are having a good trip. Have you enjoyed your stay at Breathless? How are the beaches? Are they expecting to get hit pretty hard from this Hurricane? We have 2 more days before we can cancel and get a refund and I don't know what to do.
Hi hotel is lovely and staff super friendly. Beach is really nice. Atmosphere here is normal at the moment with a few sandbags being filled and a bit of tying down. Staff don't seem to scared! It's been lovely weather and because of the quality of the hotel build we decided to stay. No dought the next few days will be different but I'm stocking up the beer fridge :)
So...I just got off the phone with expedia and Barcelo Bavaro allowed me to cancel without penalty for my upcoming trip 9.20-23. I also took advantage of jetblue's waiver and deposited the funds into a travel bank good for a year. Those of you that are afraid because they didn't take out insurance- call the hotel you are booked at and ask!!!
I'd hold on to last minute before you cancel. If email me at summers45@hotmail.co.uk if you want any other updates on the atmosphere or hotel. I'm on a buggy tour tommo until lunch but I'll pic up my emails regularly.
"Come to Varadero, bring the place to life. I'm going October 3rd."
Thank you Summers45 for offering your assitance and feedback. We are schedule to flight to Punta Cana on thursday through Copa. We have not receieve any info about flighta being cancelled yet. Hoping for the best!! We were soo excited about this trip. Please keep ups posted.
"Leticia, Im also flying on thursday with Copa. I called them earlier today and was told that the flight was still confirmed. Maybe tomorrow we will have some news."
Trip scheduled for next week to Punta Cana but not so sure about going unfortunately
"Following and just really finding out about this tonight. We are here in PC and scheduled to fly out Thursday on Southwest Air back to US and have heard nothing. Resort is very normal with no concerns we can tell. Going to check with our ""guy"" in the AM at our resort to see what is up because we have our transfer all set up for Thursday....but if airport is closed, guess that won't happen! Thanks PC Mike for all your info. Trying not to get needlessly worried, but looks like we're flying out on the wrong day ;)"
"Hi Mike, now I'm worried about Maria. We will fly into Punta Cana September 29th and don't know what kindof damage we'll find. Hoping it will miss Punta Cana. Any early advise for me?Edited: 2 years ago "
"Another delay ! Mother nature has the control ...so be it.'' In response to Hurricane Maria, please note that Transat's hurricane policy is applicable for flights scheduled for Dominican Republic until September 22, 2017.Our clients can choose to travel at a later date at no additional cost, travel to another destination served by Transat without incurring any change fees (if the package price is higher than the original booking, the client will be responsible for paying the difference) or cancel their bookings and obtain a full refund in credit vouchers.''https:/…Notice-to-Travellers"
"Still nothing on Thomson website , No updates at all"
We are currently at the Sensatori resort in uvero alto and there has been no communication as of yet. I'm really concerned! Our building is the third floor up and probably half a mile from where you would enter the sea but I'm so bothered by the fact Thomson are saying nothing.
"Hi allUpdate for you- we are currently at the Bahia Principe Ambar in punta Cana. Winds are picking up already but it's a very relaxed atmosphere here. While no one here seems to be worried, we have been contacted by our air Canada rep that we are being evacuated tomorrow on a 3pm flight back to Toronto Canada. We arrived late Saturday Sept 16th due to return Sept 23rd. It's been a glorious 2 full days of fun and sunshine. Not everyone here however with other airlines and vacation companies are doing the same. Some booked with booking.com due to fly out Thursday with Jet Blue were told they have cancelled their flight home until Saturday and now must arrange to pay hotel additional days stay. They are not happy campers. I can currently only speak to those with air Canada vacations. Website shows flights in later this week are cancelled. Good luck all! We will rebook and be back again in a few months to enjoy the rest of our stay. Stay safe! Prayers to those already affected."
"Thanks for the update. So, Air Canada is evacuating and United will not let me cancel my flight for 8:40am without a penalty. Talk about customer relations. Next time, I will definitely get insurance."
Sunwing has cancelled all flights to PC until september 22nd depending on hurricane
We still planned to fly on sat and unless things change that's still our intention
"I posted almost 2 weeks ago about being on Levels flight from Barcelona to Punta Cana, which did fly arriving just before Irma in heavy cross winds.On Wednesday evening at 10 I'm returning to Barcelona with Level. Scheduled to depart, again, just ahead of a category 5 hurricane, although I do think the flight will depart. Level seem obsessed with ensuring their flights depart and land on schedule."
Who are you flying with? We are due to fly with thomson Thursday from Manchester. I rang yesterday for advice and they said they didn't have any warning of a hurricane
Hi due to arrive tomorrow with thomsons. Anybody out there from uk heard anything about cancellations or bringing you back?Ken mac.
"We flying with Thomson and they have no warnings as of yet. I even went into local office yesterday and I knew more,than they did lol.kept saying look at website for updates. Still showing Irma"
Thanks Rushden I too went into my branch same result. Supposed to be driving up to gatwick this afternoon for overnight hotel. Bet we get told at check in tomorrow. Ken mac.
"Yeah. We went ahead and canceled our anniversary trip we'd had planned. Sad, but got almost all our money back owing to insurance. Better to do that now than to wait and then try to get a good deal elsewhere (where demand will be high as others are already booking in other areas, right?) after our departure date is closer...... If you have trip insurance I'd suggest you might think about doing the same; at least bring it up to your travel agent -- I'm certainly no expert. Hope it all works out for you. We were SO excited about our ten day trip to a great resort in P Cana (Principe Bahia Ambar Blue) -- so perfect -- it took us days to decide and find this gem. :( BUT at least we have a safe home far away from bad weather. Godspeed!"
"I didn't read all 35 pages... I'm here in Bayahibe have a bunch of dives planed for Tuesday. The Be Live Canoa is where I am staying. They have moved guests to the 2nd and third floors, and have begun boarding up the rooms facing the beach as well as putting the furniture on ground floor rooms on concrete blocks. Generally the atmosphere at the resort is good. A little talk here and there about the storm but certainly not panic or evacuations. I currently have no intentions of leaving. We are scheduled to be here till Monday the 25th. I will up date in real time as long as I have internet/cell service."
Due to fly to Punta Cana on Saturday with Thomsons............ This is our Honeymoon - 14 nights........ I have asked Thomsons for info as I still want 14 nights - i dont want to be told On Friday Eve that we are not flying and lose any of those nights even if its another destination - Thomsons told me to look at their website for updates on Hurricane Maria - HASNT GOT ANY INFO........ Their website is still showing Irma.......... USELESS!Edited: 2 years ago 
"It definitely looks like DR is in Maria's path, stay safe..."
@good-times-1971 Which model shows the path over the DR? Even the European model has now shifted away from the island - looking less likely now than before. Hopefully will be as far away as Irma was.. the US model shows that at the moment.
Vicky H :Thomson's After Holiday care team are equally as bad...... I'd be tempted to cancel - but I realise it's your Honeymoon. So sad.We're booked to PC in mid Nov. Hope all this has passed by then.
"Hi Vicky H we too due to fly Saturday from Birmingham, try not to worry too much as DR may escape it's too soon to tell I think, thomson won't cancel unless that changes , this thread is very good to follow I feel bad wishing for my holiday when so many devastated it's a difficult balance hopefully this be the last one !! Hope you get your honeymoon, hope people can get through on the islands."
Just watched the forecast on CNN and it saying Maria is gonna miss Dominican Republic probably get some wind and rain fingers crossed considering am flyin on Thursday
"Hi, My mum and dad are currently out there. They had an email last night from British Airways to say their flight would be 9am Wednesday instead of 5.30pm Thursday."
@RichieEvertonWe are flying Thursday too from Manchester. I have a feeling that they flight might be rescheduled to Friday like they did with Irma.....thats assuming Maria passes the DR without causing any issues. Are you flying with Thomson? Still no word on their website. Hopefully PCMike has some updates for us later this morning.
Fingers crossed the Hurricane passes by We are due to fly out on 19th October We were there in July never been in October before so on constant hurricane watch at the minuteHope everyone gets to DR safe and if you are already there that you are safe and the storm passes over
@Dave SI think you should read all 35 pages out of courtesy ha ha
We still holding out for Saturday and hoping that recent reports saying it will go slightly north will prove to be right. Fingers crossed
I've just spoken to Thomsons on their assistance number 02034512688 options 2 then 5. They said flight tomorrow still going ahead. You'll need your ref number if you ringing.Ken mac.
Yeah janine am flyin with Thomson phoned them yesterday they said everything was normal and keep a eye on my emails which I am doin
"@RushdenFoxyWe are still hopeful and holding out too@RichieEvertonYep, we got the same line from Thomsons. I find it odd that Irma was reported on so much and for so long before it hit anywhere, yet Maria seems to be passing by without mention."
Excellence have just posted this on their Blog and Facebook pagehttps:/…
Interestingly BA cancelled Thursdays Punta Cana flight yesterday as they say the airport will be closed. They're sending a flight out empty tomorrow to fly back early those who were due to return on Thursday!QTK
Update on the Thomson website thomson.co.uk/destinations/…hurricane-maria
"Cnn , their updated page shows Maria going towards the DR. But companies are. Cancelling flights to DR, bringing ppl back early ?"
Iv been going Caribbean last 20 years in hurricane season n this is first time we had one I go on 21st n gone round this same date for 2 wk so y not book in hurricane season
"I'm due to fly out in the morning (20/9)from Gatwick London to punta Cana and Thomson are saying flights are still going ahead. Quite worrying after seeing hurricane Maria's path, won't know if flights will be delayed or cancelled until tomorrow I guess. Fingers crossed!Edited: 2 years ago "
@Gemma MHave you seen the update?thomson.co.uk/destinations/…hurricane-maria
do you know if they will be cancelling the sunday ba flight or where i can get more info on this ?Edited: 2 years ago 
"Hi all,I am flying out from Manchester on 12:55 flight on Thursday with Thomas Cook, is anyone else? They aren't very helpful over the phone just saying the flight is still due to go ahead. Has any one been offered to change destination by Thomas Cook?"
"Hi, I am on the same flight.Rang this morning and all they said is that the flight is on time.Nothing on website neither"
VJP93 - I'm also due to leave on Sunday's BA flight. Their website says they are reviewing the status and will provide an update on Friday 22 September.https:/…Fingers crossed!
We are on the same flight. We've decided to not cancel and go ahead - unless Thomson cancel on us :/
"Hi guys,I'm reading this thread since first posts. So, we booked All Inclusive for 1 week at TUI, our flight is in 3,5 hours today, we are already at the airport. I called TUI couple times - no information about changing flights, everything is just as planned. We are really worried, because the only decision now we can make is to cancel our trip - which means no money refund for us. Tui is not gonna give us any other options than to fly. Polish MSZ (National Department for issues like that) will publish warnings only when hurricane actually hits. Don't know what to do.."
"Mike, could u give us update on the position? looks like in turning a bit east , so good for DRhttps:/…DKE5HwpVAAEVCt8.jpgi am on tomorrow Gatwick flight."
@Adi O - TUI will not fly if it is dangerous - you will arrive before Maria is in the area - and it is most likely that you will have a day of tropical storm in your resort on Thursday. Reason TUI (Thomson) flights on Wednesday or Thursday are being moved is because they cannot fly when the storm is passing.. I wouldn't worry too much - but do talk to the airline if you have concerns.Edited: 2 years ago 
Do you think BA will give the option to change holiday destination at all?
"Me and my wife are out in Punta Cana Until Monday. It appears to be 'business as usual' at our resort. From checking various weather reports/predictions, we are going to see some strong winds and rain late Wednesday evening until early Friday morning. I'm certainly not worried. There's no mention of evacuating to another hotel, although this may change. We will know more by the end of today."
"Good morning everyone. Looks like another nice day to be on the beach or doing whatever in the region.Some good and bad news this morning.First the good!Maria felt the effects of Dominica last night and it took a little poop out of her...not much, but a bit, yet still remains a cat 5 hurricane. She also moved a little to the east (a good thing) and is moving faster. Last night's position on the north shore of Puerto Rico had Maria passing over Aguadilla (the northwest point of the island) at 8pm. Now she is leaving the island in Arecibo (about 25 miles further east) at 2pm. This is the difference between the 11pm report and the 5am report, thus forecasts can change quickly.With this further shift east, we can expect less in the wind department. Last night, forecasted wind gusts were in the range of 50-60 mph and median wind speed 30-35mph along the beaches. Now, gusts are forecast in the mid 40's to low 50s and median wind in the 20-30mph range. A big improvement.The majority of blustery winds will also be out of the northwest and southwest, much as was the case with Irma. This wind has to cross a fair bit of land, thus it can be broken down somewhat.Rainload is also showing a lower amount. Yesterday, amounts of 8 to 14 inches were forecast. Now total rainfall is 3 to 5 inches. Still a good amount of rain.The bad news??? First off, I wasted my evening watching the Leafs loose...but I should be used to that!More important...Significant wave heights are forecast to be in the 13 to 16-foot range and swell in the 12 to 13-foot range. This can and probably will be disastrous for some beach areas and resorts. Areas like Cortecito come to mind, as does any resort north of Majestic, where the beaches have no reef to break down the swell.Not trying to panic anyone, just trying to be rational.Those who are here, please follow the instructions of the resort management. You may not agree with them, but ask yourself...""when was the last time I lived through a hurricane""? Starting later tomorrow, stay away from the beach areas as some pretty large surf can appear out of nowhere. If you are in a room the resort considers a higher risk...you will be moved. There will be no negotiation about this....none. You go...case closed.Resorts are all well stocked with food and supplies (as they always are for issues as such). Don't expect the fine dining or the show at the Teppanyaki, but you will have food and drink.Once the storm passes, there could very well be some damage to the resort or the resort grounds. Localized flooding is likely to occur, as well as some localized power outages. Please...again, follow the directions of resort management.As a suggestion for those in a resort now and who will be riding out the storm. If you can, take a complimentary shuttle to either San Juan Shopping or Palma Real Shopping and stock up on creature comforts such as snacks, toiletries and maybe a favorite bottle of whatever. It can make the night (Wednesday-Thursday) more comfortable.Well, off to school and a bit of work this morning before sitting yet again in the dentist's chair. I will pipe in later this morning.CheersPuntaCanaMike"
"Mike your posts keep me going lolI have a question about the surf and reef you were speaking of though. The resorts that are located on the sandbar between the Laguna Bavaro and the ocean, what do you expect for them as far as storm surge and potential flooding? I have been trying to do research on the area as you post so I can keep up but I'm not exactly sure where the reef starts and ends and the fact that there is a body of water directly behind makes me a little more nervous as well. Any expertise you have on this would be appreciated even more. Thank you."
"Hi all,I am at the Riu Bavarao Palace with my mum. At the moment there is no news from the resort or our Thomson rep. I have called the 24/7 Thomson hotline and no real info there either. PuntaCanaMike, thank you for the updates, though it would be an understatement to say I am not worried. I am very worried especially as noone is giving us any info at the resort.Anyone else at the Bavaro Palace,keep in touch. Stay safe."
"That is right behind Coretcito. It has been known to flood with heavy rains, thus if we get rain and surge...yet...it will be wet in that area."
"Ocean Blue is in this same area, it appears a previous hurricane has damaged their beach. Would you anticipate further damage there too? This is just to the north I do believe."
has Gran Bahia beach the reef? will be protected?
We are leaving for our week long honeymoon to Punta Cana on Oct 9th? Should we be worried? Is Punta Cana built to withstand major hurricanes? Thank you!
How is Punta Cana going to be impacted by Maria?
"Thanks for the update MikeHow do you think this will effect Dreams Palm Beach. Are they protected at all? Also, could Maria hitting Puerto Rico change this at all Thank you"
"The reef will soften the blow, but will still have some rearrangement od the beach by the time it passes."
Good morning Mike...what about the Majestic and flooding..your opinion please
Does anybody know after Iberostar Bavaro Suites get any flooding from Maria
Yes thank u! It's a large group of us going so waiting to hear if Thomson cancel the flight then will go else where. Such a shame
We'll be at the Princess resort in Punta Cana Oct 13th as well! Looking closely at all the updates! Here's hoping it's all good!
When do u leave?
"Mike Thank you so much for all the updates! We all appreciate it so much.. Although I'm disappointed my wedding was cancelled I rather be safe than sorry. Who wants to share their wedding with a hurricane. LOL! However, my travel dates have already been rescheduled for next week. If you don't mind please keep up updated on the damages. I may have to completely rebook my wedding at another location. Really hate to do that and praying for minimal damage or none. Stay Save! Cheers!"
"Janine G We are currently staying at Dreams Palm beach in punta cana, and all they have said to us is the monitoring the situation but they're doesn't seem to be any real reason to panic as I think it's just heavy rain expected as the same with Irma, as PCMike said a lot of people cancelled and just one days rain and it made the hotels completely empty, I'll post as and when I can about when it actually starts.Hope this helps"
Little update from my booking - TUI (Thomson) just gave us a chance to rebook the trip to another direction. So we probably go to Spain. I need sunny vacation ASAP.
Mike my friends are staying at Zoetry resort. What would be the projection of flooding for this area of Punta Cana
"Good morning PCMIKE and all! Happy to see there's some good news this morning but we need to see more and more of that lol I see you said resorts north of Majestic are in danger of waves and flooding, does Royalton fit into that category? What are your thoughts on the beach there and possible flooding on the grounds, or resort damage?We have until today to cancel so we're trying to make the best possible decision for our family. We appreciate all of your help! God bless!"
"Hi PC Mike - when you say resorts north of Majestic should be aware of the surge & potential problems that brings, does that include Majestic?"
My sister is staying at the Royalton on the third floor facing away from the beach. Her kids are just behind there at Memories Splash on the first floor. The resorts have put them in lock down beginning tonight at 11pm through Friday and are moving everyone off of the first floor to the second or third floors.My question PC Mike - you talked about the high waves - is The Royalton even safe to be at considering its proximity to the beach? Thank you for your updates.
"Flying in to PUJ at 8:40 EST, hoping to land around 12:40pm. How screwed am I?"
Is the Royalton protected by reef? Thanks
"Lemme rephrase. Flying in THURSDAY at 8:40am, trying to land 12:40. How screwed am I? Is Barcelo Bavaro beach affected at all?"
Is dreams spa hotel higher than dreams palm? I get confused.Edited: 2 years ago 
"I'm due to fly out on Friday, trying to talk our party into delaying a day or two but they want to delay for a week. Staying at Secrets Cap Cana. Storm keeps pushing north east a little each day. Hope that keeps up!"
George MThank you very much. I appreciate it.Stay safe
My wife and I are scheduled to arrive at dreams palm beach on 25th Sept for a 10 night honeymoon. Is it change holiday time or will we be ok?thanks

"anthony RI would just wait until we know more. You probably wont be able to change it without losing huge amounts, unless its a flexible booking.I fly on Thursday (although thats unlikely) but I am hanging fire to see what the outcome is. Keep watching this thread. PuntaCanaMike keeps us well informed and he knows his stuffCongrats on your marriage"
Thank you once again PCMike. I haven't bookedA vacation out of the country since 2005 and I was supposed to go to Mexico and then hurricane Emily head and destroyed our hotel. We were able to book a trip to Jamaica for 3 days and it just was not what I was expecting. So you're I finally decide to book another trip out of country it has to be the worst hurricane season and a long time. We don't leave until October 1st so I am hoping that if there is damage it will mostly be repaired by then. I guess my question is when things like this happen does it disrupt the clarity of the water and the debris that will be on shore? Again My main concern is that all of the locals and anyone on Holiday there is safe and hopefully it just shifts further East and doesn't cause any damage. I'll be watching closely to look for more updates from you thank you again
"Pcmike also, We will be staying at the hard rock. And I know the resort is huge so does that usually get a lot of Damage when things like that happen and is it susceptible to flooding"
"Thanks Janine,we'll do just that. fingers crossed for Thursday and it is all ok for you and for us Monday. I'm happy to go there or anywhere if they change it. Thanks againAnthony"
"What is the latest on Maria, flying in on the 23rd, have to make a decision by tomorrow to cancel or roll with it? HELP"
Thanks AnthonyMight see you there
Hi PC Mike. I'm due to fly Saturday for my honeymoon will be staying at serenis. This is a very special vacation and I do really want to go but as we definitely want a 14 night vacation do I change my destination now to avoid not having a full 14 day holiday? I'm sorry to add another question to this list but it's stressing me out now
Upgraded to Category 5http://www.nhc.noaa.gov
"i think Mark and Katie cancelling their trip on possibility is wise, whats wrong with that? the possibility is the island is in complete tatters and ruins, and if its not then great, but with natural disasters you can't be over cautious, i mean look a this hurricane after irma?"
"We arrived at Excellence El Carmen yesterday. We were given hurricane watch information last night which included an option to leave without penalty. I see Mike is less confident DR will come off as well as it did with Irma.Place seems very quiet and has a bit of a ""calm before the storm"" feel to it. I'm going to be optimistic!"
Any updates on hurricane damage on dreams resort punta cana?
"Thanks Mike for the updates. I'm following you closely as our daughter and son in law arrived yesterday for their honeymoon and are staying at Chic, which appears to be north of Majestic. We are so worried about their safety and everyone there. We closely followed Irma and your posts then knew Jose was not near the area then were busy with all wedding festivities we didn't know about Maria until after they left yesterday!"
"Air Canada, Sunwing, Air Tansat have cancelled all flight to DR was in news this morning . It said they are offering refunds or re-booking to all customers. They are monitoring situation, and may decide to bring people out head of Maria. You should contact your representative."
All flights booked up to Sept 24
We are here now staying at the Melia Caribe Tropical. They haven't said anything to us yet. Everything operating as normal.
TUI delayed Gatwick and Manchester till Friday.
Flight from Manchester 910 am on 21/09 cancelled for 24 hrs
I am supposed to be flying with Air Transat to Punta Cana from Toronto the 21st but the hurricane policy is in affect. The flight is still running on time not cancelled but we have the option to go or rebook to a different date. We are going to rebook although it's a bummer.
"Brenda, Chic is next to Sensatori where we are staying. We have had no news yet but it seems we are in the area at risk of flooding. Only bonus I can see is that these two hotels seem to be set back a little more than others on this coastline. Fingers crossed. We are all hoping for the best."
"Good morning all, I see this chat is still going strong!!Last night we were able to call Jetblue and reschedule our Thursday 21 flight from NY (arriving PC at 12pm) to Saturday 23. We emailed the hotel our new itinerary and they will honor our new dates. We were thinking of simply going to Aruba; but after talking to the local representative at the hotel, and watching the 8pm and 11pm National Center models, we were confident about our Saturday flight. Last night Hurricane Maria spun my home country Dominica into a frenzy. The island was hit spot on by a Category 5 Hurricane Maria. I expected Maria to die down after dealing with the hills and mountains in Dominica, and it did, but at 8am she was back up to a Category 5, with sustained winds of 160mph. Stay safe everyone... sometimes its not the actual day/night of the hurricane thats the hardest, but the cleanup and discovery after the storm. Still trying to contact my family but most connection has been lost. I believe our Saturday flight will be ok! It gives the people of DR, and especially the hotel staff time to breathe and deal with their families & loved ones before caterring to the needs of tourist. Stay safe everyone!"
We are at ocean blue and sand until Sunday... is this one of the hotels that you said would get the worst hit?
"Dear all,Iam watching this forum from the start, Iam from Czech and we are goind to Dominica Bayahibe 13th October, Iam not afraid of the weather, but I afraid that the hotel could be damaged. I pray for all whos on Dominica now and I will watch this forum until the end.Barbora"
We're travelling to Barceló Bavaro Beach this Friday Sept 22. Any info would be helpful.
"Ok....blanket statement. All resorts are susceptible to ""localized"" flooding. There are no resorts on high elevation. Rain is the main cause of the flooding.As for waves...the most vulnerable resorts are as follows.RoyaltonOccidental CaribeRiu RepublicaHard RockChicDreams Punta CanaNow OnyxBreathlessExcellence del CarmenSirenisExcellenceZoetrySivoryThis does not mean that damage will occur. It simply means that they do not have a barrier reef to break down the swell. I should also state, as I did earlier, that even the resorts located inside the reef are not immune from beach damage.Please...no more specific questions about individual resorts. Cheers,PuntaCanaMike"
Dominica is just too small of an island to deflect a storm of this size. Even Puerto Rico is probably going to be little more than a nuisance.
Thanks again PCMike.
"Also, a few tips to the American travelers/ those who need it:- If you do not have travel insurance, but booked on a travel credit card (American Express Platinum/Chase Sapphire Reserve/Citi Prestige, etc)... have no fear, I did too but I have an awesome travel card. Call your credit card company, because your card might already have travel insurance/ trip protection. I could have received my entire trip (flights and hotel booked separately) refunded by simply putting in a claim with my credit card company stating that 'Severe weather' interrupted my travel plans. Work with your credit card company to avoid fees and long hold times with the airline companies.- If you traveled with JetBlue, they've been offering waivers for anyone traveling this week (18-21st) since Sunday.- If you're trying to rebook with JetBlue, Thursday is completely sold out (unless you get my old seats), Friday is completely booked and when we called last night, the two flights available on Saturday were both at 90% capacity.- If you're booked with Melia/Paradisus, they are willing to honor your nights/duration of stay. Try your best to reschedule... just email them a copy of your new itinerary.- If you flights weren't cancelled (United people) but you booked with a travel card, call your credit company. You could still get a refunded because of severe weather interrupting your vacation.- If you booked with a travel company, call to get your flight rebooked or ask for a destination change.... don't budge, this is beyond you control and their have provisions/ plans in place for natural events like these."
Hey im suppose to go to puna cana. On the 24th did you cancel idk what to do
PCMikeWhen do you think would be possible to assess damage to island? Thursday morning?
"We are at Dreams Punta Cana right now. We got a call from our Westjet rep that we will be flown home later today instead of Sunday. No details yet. It's beautiful here at the moment. We're going to head to the pool to soak up a few more hours of sunshine until we get all the info about coming home. It's disappointing, but understandable. :("
That's it then flights with thomson cancelled until Friday at least.
Have they delayed the flight for 24 hours can you let me know who you are flying with - I am meant to be going 12:55 on Thursday
"Greg We will be feeling the effects of Maria on Thursday most of the day, with a southwest breeze. Friday will be the day to look back and observe.CheersPCMike"
Any updates on damage to Iberostar Dominicana?
Shan - it's not got near dominican republic yet ... see below www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at5.shtml…
"Shan H,Damage from what? Maria won't hit the Dominican Republic until Thursday.Mark"
I am clearly seeing that many have no idea where in the world Punta Cana is.
"Mike, they are probably confusing the DR with Dominica.., or maybe not. : )Edited: 2 years ago "
LOL Mike you must had been Canadian with that humor.
"it's ""Humour"".....eh?LOL"
"we were not scheduled to arrive until Sept 30 but just to be on the safe side we called our travel company (expedia) and we were able to do a ""change"" to our reservation for $75 per passenger. We are heading to Jamaica instead. Hotel was free cancellation (Majestic Elegance) and AirCanada charged us the 75$ for changes.Good luck everyone. I was really looking forward going to Punta Cana, especially Majestic, I guess it will have to wait!!Thanks PC Mike for all your comments/advice, I have been following along from the very first post.hope you all stay safe!"
Wow! Thank you PC Mike and everyone on this forum! So informative!
"Hey, I've met people from the USA who couldn't point out Canada on a map.Mark"
It s sun y today in punta cana but for Howden long?
Yup you cannot NOT be a Canadian without loving the Leafs! Minus last night WTF was that.
Just got word that WestJet is now evacuating folks today (some that were staying until Sunday). GO SENS GO...

"Does anyone know if the flight planned to leave Punta Cana on Thursday evening is still happening travelling to Manchester with Thomas Cook, I have read that the flight planned to go out to Punta Cana has been delayed for 24hours which surely means there will be no plane to fly passengers back on Thursday evening?"
"The biggest issue is not that they do not know where Punta Cana, it is thay they do not care where it is...."
Chrystal S - I am waitign to hear back from Thomas Cook. The lady on the phone said she would contact head office and call me back. I heard flight were cancelled until Friday - not sure if there is any truth in it though
We where cancelled as of Sunday with Air Canada vacations Had the option to travel to Jamaica .. take a look at the weather 90% thunderstorms with tons of rain no thanks.. we took advantage of the A.C. good will policy (We had no insurance) we got our money backLet the islands rebuild .. See you in December
Chrystal SThomson have delayed flights to and from PC for 24 hours
"Hi,I plan to go to Punta Cana 27th of Sep. Will it be OK at that time?Thanks.GJ"
"just seen tweets from Dominica and Guadalupe. Complete mess. Now Puerto-Rico will get direct hit. Mountains will mud the rest. Just think if Puerto Rico has the means to change Maria Path?PCMike, when do you think will be known how far from the PuntaCana will pass?Direct Hit is still possible?The current path is the same as Irma? Maria is only 60miles wide ."
"Often times the tropics will forecast 90% rain, it’ll be nice and sunny 95% the day. I might downpour late at night overnight or for 5 minutes during the day. Jamacia could be different but my experience when in PC was forecasted rain everyday, sunny by day rain sometimes at night. (heavy rain)"
Arrived yesterday and no signs of any boarding up of windows as yet. Got welcome meeting with rep in 20 mins will update . Ps weather is lovely . Nice breeze but not windy
Their Facebook page has detailed alerts
I went to Jamaica a few years back. The forecast said rain everyday. For the 10 days I was there I saw rain 1 day for 5 minutes and it was late in the evening!!
We are at Secrets Royal Beach. Beautiful day today. No signs of boarding up anything. We are enjoying our last few days here. No one is worried around here.
We are currently at the Majestic Mirage and will be sticking it out through the hurricane. We've been moved to a building further away from the beach and some precautions to board up windows and solidify the structures has begun but there's been no panic or concerning voices among the staff we've talked to. Everyone is composed and seemingly ready to handle whatever happens. Stay strong and stay safe everyone.
I am looking closing and seeing what Lee is doing in the Atlantic..... https://stormpulse.com/atlantic/
We are booked to arrive the 27th... fingers crossed! I don't want to have to re-book!
"Thanks for your update, I did ring Thomas Cook but the lady was useless and just said there are no updates. Surely common sense says if no flight is going out on Thursday then none can fly back!If you do get an update please do let me know :)"
Currently at Secrets Cap Cana. We are leaving today and the hotel has advised people to make plans to leave where possible. They have cleared all the sunbeds from the beach and some from round the pool.
"Hi, can I ask when you were due to fly back I have friends in the same resort and we are trying to find out if their flight is still planned to leave on Thursday?"
"Oh no!From the NYTThe Caribbean island nation of Dominica sustained “mind boggling” damage from Hurricane Maria, its prime minister said on Tuesday, after the storm hit with maximum sustained winds of nearly 160 miles per hour that ripped roofs off buildings, including his own home.There was no immediate word of deaths or injuries on the island from Maria, the third in a string of devastating hurricanes to sweep through the region in recent weeks.The National Hurricane Center said Tuesday morning that Maria, now moving away from Dominica, had regained Category 5 strength, after briefly dropping to Category 4. The “potentially catastrophic” storm is expected to approach the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday night and Wednesday, the center said.Roosevelt Skerrit, Dominica’s prime minister, wrote on Facebook earlier Tuesday that the island nation of 72,000 had experienced “widespread devastation,” based on initial reports.“So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace,” he said. “My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains.”Mr. Skerrit said that “the winds have swept away the roofs of almost every person I have spoken to or otherwise made contact with.” On Monday night, he had said on Facebook that he had to be rescued after the storm tore the roof off his own official residence.He said the island’s immediate priority was to rescue people who were trapped and provide medical care to the injured. “I am honestly not preoccupied with physical damage at this time, because it is devastating … indeed, mind boggling,” Mr. Skerrit said.As of early Tuesday morning, soon after the prime minister posted his most recent Facebook entry, phone and internet signals on Dominica appeared to be down, leaving the island virtually incommunicado.The storm had strengthened to Category 5, with maximum sustained winds near 160 m.p.h., hours before the eye passed over Dominica. Just over a day earlier it had been a tropical storm, but wind speeds had increased by 90 m.p.h. within 27 hours, the National Weather Service said.After hitting Dominica, Maria weakened to Category 4 and continued northwest, with the eye of the storm passing south of the French island of Guadeloupe, before regaining strength."
We still flying out on 23rd and still glass hal full but pretty confident that it will be a full glass about 4pm on sat .Keeping an eye on things but have no intentions of cancelling at all .Just keeping watching the posts everyone and read what PCMIKE puts in his updates.Cheers all
"Not being unkind either; I live in south Louisiana and anyone who lives on the coast, whether the US or abroad will tell you the same thing: There is a chance of hurricanes but not a certainty of them during the season so you cannot simply stop doing everything from June through November.People live in tornado prone areas and earthquake areas and they don't stop their lives because of a possibility! So to comment on your post, it's worth the chance of traveling during the hurricane season as it's no different than living anywhere! No one can live in a bubble....."
Jay s why you saying oh noWe all know about Dominica and it's awful but that's mother nature for ya. now we prey and hope for Puerto Rica and Dom Rep
RushdenFoxyThink he may be confusing with DR. My friend did the same this morning and said she was gutted we couldn't go.I am flying on the delayed flight from Manchester on Friday and have the same outlook as you
Jay probably thinks the DR and Dominica are the same countries.
"Jay S, Dominica is a completely different country than the Dominican Republic."
"Janine GGood on ya . no point panicing over something out of our hands , so we all set for Saturday and will see how it is but going with the impression to enjoy our holiday as we have waited for so long for it to arrive."
"Janine G - what flight are you on, on Friday - My flight was meant to go out Thursday at 12:55 from Manchester but i haven't heard anything yet :("
"Level have brought their flight from Barcelona to Punta Cana tomorrow forward to a 12pm departure, and the same flight will depart Punta Cana for Barcelona at 17:10 tomorrow - instead of at 22:10."

We are on that flight the text advised 4.15 departure it is now showing 8am on there travel advice page
On a positive note on CNN at 11:00 DR is still under a watch and not a warning
Yes positive is good . quite a few sites now showing it brushing Dom Rep so as long as it stays on that path then damage won't be as bad.Irma hit Puerto plata worse than Punta but this time Puerto plata has no flight cancelations from UK as yet as looks like it will be nearer Punta than PP
"Not very good at this, as you can tell, first message was for Janine- but we have now had a call advising thomson flight tom118 will now leave 8am Friday."
"katebrindleYes that is correct , scroll down on thread and you will see where i have posted Thomson flights"
"Re Post Thomson flights Flights departing from UK to Dominican Republic - Flight TOM054 from London Gatwick to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic which is due to depart on Wednesday 20th September is delayed by 48 hours and is planned to operate on Friday 22nd September 11:40 local time. - Flight TOM118 from Manchester to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic which is due to depart on Thursday 21st September, is delayed by 24 hours and is planned to operate on Friday 22nd departing 08:00 local time. - Flight TOM050 from London Gatwick to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic is planned to operate on Friday 22nd September at 10:30 local time as scheduled.

"katebrindlewhen you click on Hurricane Maria , then when you scroll down chnage the OLDEST FIRST tab to NEWEST FIRST , that way you can look at all recent posts on that thread"
"11am update...I am out of the chair and trying to drink a Bohemia with a half frozen mouth. So far...no spillage!!!As for Maria...not much change...she did inch a mile or two closer to us, but as long as she does not make a left turn at Puerto Rico, we should remain on the weaker side of the girl. She is packing a strong right hook...the left is considerably weaker.My earlier predictions stand.More later. Now...back to my Bohemia!CheersPuntaCanaMike"
Breathless onyx and dreams hotels all still calm and service as normal. Fingers crossed we miss the bulk.
"-RushdenFoxy ThankyouThomson informed us of leaving 4.15 from Manchester they have now confirmed 8am and apologised for messing us about, delighted with 8am bit of drama with parking at mcr airport, but I'm certainly in a happier place than I have been the last few days."
"Hi Mike Now don't you go spilling any lol.Your predication is looking right as per usual .Hope your having a nice day mate , i am sure the questions to you will all start again very soon so sit back and relax my friend.Cheers Jon"
katebrindleYour very welcome.Hope all goes well and you have a lovely holiday.. NOW breath lol
Thomas Cook rep on resort has advised that their flights from Punta Cana back to UK which were due o leave on Thursday are now leaving tomorrow instead.
A quick update from Riu Palace Bavaro - no update from anyone - neither hotel or thomson rep!Have managed to locate a rep who will update us after 3pm. Will post an update as soon as I hear anything.
"Hi all - Air Transat has cancelled flights until the 22nd and Hurricane Policy is in affect until the 25th. Maria doesn't seem to be slowing down, so we're starting to make arrangement to rebook to another destination. PC Mike - thank you for everything. I followed your comments diligently for Irma and now for Maria. Hoping there's an upside to this. Praying for everyone's safety in the meantime!"
"No upside for me....lost a ton of business next week along with other companies here. But, that is minor. What we hope for on the upside is that Maria dances to the left of us and we all can get back to business as soon as we can!"
"-RushdenFoxy Haha thanks , hope you have a great holiday :-)"
lol...Mike have another beer...I mean right of us!
I just figured you were standing facing the south! :-)
"Just as George, I'm Also reporting from Dreams Palms Punta Cana, everything here is fine by now, business as usual, the locals seem pretty calm. One thing that's different is that the staff is cutting down old palm leaves and that's it, but who knows it could've been scheduled earlier. Today in the night we received a note that there's a hurricane on its way and that there's a watch set. The worst case scenario is that we'll get evacuated somewhere else."
"Same as me. Will arrive on 27th. If you think we need to reschedule, please share with me."
"""Looks like some tour operators are evacuating today but guess Thomson are not as bothered about our safety""I do not think that for one moment"
"Hi we are due to arrive in Punta Cana on the 9th of October, I would really appreciate some input on our hotel , someone who may be there now? we are staying at the Iberostar DominicanaThanks in advance"
"koala200160If you want info on your hotel then go onto the hotels page and read all the reviews , i am sure you will find info your looking for.This thread is about the approaching Maria"
koala200160Even if you are meaning about storm damage please note that Maria has not reached the island yet and will not do so until around ThursdayEdited: 2 years ago 
"Hi all, We are travelling at the end of October (I know a long time off, compared to other travellers facing the stress of maria and her travel plans). Its the unknown that we are worried about, How much destruction? damage? floods? etc etc; and whether she will ruin our holiday along with plenty of others. Keep us updated on the state of the island. First time to the caribbean and this happens.....STRESS! Good luck to all those travelling soon, and lets hope you guys can enjoy your holiday to the fullest, as planned."
"100lucyp14I am sure by the end of October you will not even notice any damage at all , so just sit back and tick the days off till your holiday arrives .In the meantime keep watching PCMIKES updates as he lives there and is very good at his advice.4 days for us and looking forward to arrivingCheers"
"We are flying out to Punta Cana next week on the 26th Tuesday for our honeymoon. We booked through Travelocity, (all inclusive flights (COPA airlines) and hotel (Majestic Mirage). The hotel cancellation policy is full refund before the 20th (6pm local time tomorrow) For airline, i have an option to change destination to fly anywhere in ""AREA 1: which includes central, South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. We really rather go somewhere else if there is gonna endanger our lives or involve a lot of stress. What should we do?"
We are at Sensatori and have been given no update yet. The only change I see is the sea seems more rough that previous with a lot of seaweed washed up on the beach. The hotel have started filling sand bags up too. Other than that all seems very relaxed.
Hi I'm flying with thomsons on thomsons from gatwick. We're scheduled for Friday 22nd now.
"kenm1830Glad you got sorted , we are the day after on Sat. Enjoy your holidays"
Kristy...the sea would not be any rougher due to Maria at this time. Just a rougher day. Tomorrow is when you will see Maria's effects.
"""We are at Sensatori and have been given no update yet""You could always ask"
"Flip flop man ....I have, the response was we have nothing to tell you yet."
WOW not exactly very helpful
We are flying out on Saturday the 29th for the same hotel. I emailed them after Irma and there was no damage at all. I am not changing or cancelling til I see what if any damage will occur. PuntaCana Mike was on target with Irma so I am hoping he is with Maria and this is the last one to get close to DR. If he is on target it will be long gone with little debris to clean up and they will be back in business in a day or two. Congratulations and hope Maria don't mess up your honeymoon!
Exactly ....I appreciate things can change but the Thomson reps (or maybe just this lady in particular) have been most unhelpful. Some indication of their considerations would be helpful at this time.
"Kirsty...as you have been reading the forum, note the info you need to know. Yes...Maria will impact us. Not as hard as the media may have you believe, but there will be some mess to clean up after. Tomorrow...or later today, you will likely be given a game plan by the resort (not by your rep). It could result in a room relocation or evacuation, based on the info they have 24 hours in advance. Please remain calm (as I am...lol), and information will come in timely manner. It is not like you are being blind sided by this, nor is this a tornado that appears suddenly out of the sky. There is time to react. Enjoy today as the sun is shining!CheersPCMike"
We are at the Royal Suites and they have made some preparations but haven't mentioned anything. We fly out at 1pm tomorrow and am praying everything goes well when we check in here shortly. I will keep you updated.
"Mike, you were spot on days in advance of Irma. It seems to appear somewhat positive or at worst hopeful that this will just create some cleanup with the island and more importantly its people unharmed long term. Seeing/hearing of the smaller islands being decimated I think has many of us fearful the same could occur in PC."
"Thanks Mike,It is your advice that I think helps some of us regain sanity with the unknown haha! Snacks will be stocked just incase!!"
How are you doing?
"I am travelling to Punta Cana on Oct 10th to the Ocean blue and sand resort , do I have anything to worry about? :/"
We are here in Luxury Bhaia Fantasia. Everyone seems calm here but getting ready for the storm. We were supposed to leave on the 23rd but Air Transat is taking us back tomorrow.
Just waiting to be picked up from Secrets Cap Cana. They are starting to board up now but are still checking people in. We are travelling with BA who have 2 flights back to UK tomorrow but Thursday flight cancelled. People have been moved from Thursday flight to Wednesday.
I must be very lucky I arrived just after Irma and left on Friday and had perfect weather while we were there.
"Our flight from Manchester to punta Cana on Thursday has been cancelled, Thomas cook have said there not selling anymore holidays to there now until after hurricane season is over"
NHC just put up there 2pm update and track on the NHC site
We've received notification from Blue Bay and Thomas Cook that our flight home from PC has been brought forward from Thursday to tomorrow. Communication with them has been excellent. Now enjoying the hot sunny weather before we leave. The resorts are well prepared and for those staying trust the hotel protcols they are well equipped to deal with the situations we've been stuck in one before. I just hope that the residents of the island remain safe and well. Thanks PC Mike for the invaluable updates.
"Hi Mike, thank you for sharing good relative info! I do have a few questions and I am hoping you can help. We are traveling to the Barcelo Bavaro Palace the end of the month, I realize we are 1.5 weeks out but I am concerned about the weather and any possible damage to the beaches due to storm surge and flooding-are you familiar with this resort? Based on the location would this be a concern? I'm not exactly sure where the reef starts and ends. Also, is there another storm forming behind Maria that could be a threat in the next 2 weeks? I thought I read something on Noaha? Any expertise you have on this would be appreciated:) Thank you."
"Hello, I don't know what to do. My daughter with her boyfriend suppose to go to Punta Cana Sep 28 for her Oct 3rd birthday. Should we cancel the tip?"
That is good to hearBlue Bay Travel / Caribbean Warehouse are excellent and dealt very proficiently with the Icelandic ash problem and the swine flue epidemic a few years back - mow that was flight chaos!!Where are you staying?
Victoria WWhy do you not know what to do.The hurricane will be gone by this Friday so that's a whole week before so just wish them happy holidays
"Foxy- We are in the same boat as you, leaving on the 23rd.... ive heard nothing from the agency we booked from (bookit.com), and as far as I can see American airlines hasn't cancelled any flights, even through Thursday afternoon. Assuming our resort is fine- were hoping to be drink in hand by 4pm Saturday. lol"
"They are going to Riu Palace Punta Cana. They are two kids on disabilities. If the hotel doesn't have certain things, maybe destroyed by the storm, they would not be able to enjoy. If where would be high wind still, they would not be able to come outside...Anyway, what the weather is going to be like after...?"
""" If where would be high wind still, they would not be able to come outside...Anyway, what the weather is going to be like after...?""It is a waiting game as no one knows what Maria will do when it arrives or passes by and what the weather will be like next week is another big guessTravelling at this time of the year has risks and people need to take account of that when they book"
Sensatori being evacuated tomorrow to Santa Domingo.
"ledwards0613That's great to hear , better to be on positive side . We can do nothing about mother nature , what we do is remain positive and calm , do research and look forward to being by the pool with a drink in hand lol.Enjoy your holiday and have a fab time"
"FlpFlop - I understand about the risks, but it's kind of an expected birthday present every year. They were traveling to Costa Rica before and never had problems with weather. Last couple of years only. Last year - Jamaika and now...Anyway, than you for the info..."
It was a thank you. :)
"Will from everything I have read all Canadian airlines are sending ""rescue planes"" today and tomorrow, can't speak for other Countries though."
Victoria WThe weather will most likely be hot and sunny by next week with maybe a shower in the evening
Will you now cancel or will you still go? We are on the same flight and considering changing to somewhere else as we are not only pissed off with thomsons but also aware they don't actually care if we go there and it is a terrible decision. Seems they only care much about retaining most of the funds they have from us. Also they couldn't care less about the quality of holiday we experience through them!! Thoroughly disgruntledEdited: 2 years ago 
"I am currently in Punta Cana at the Melia Caribe. Our airline (Allegiant Air booked through Vacation Express) is not sending ""rescue flights"" for us. They said if we want to leave then we have to book our own flight at our own cost. We looked last night and prices were $250, but didn't book because we were waiting on direction from Allegiant Air / Vacation Express). Well, now that they aren't sending a flight for us, we looked up flights and the same flight that was $250 yesterday is now $1,000 per person. Absolutely crazy that airlines do this when people are trying to take precautions. With that being said, the hotel has been very calm and we are following protocol. We've moved our room farther back from the ocean and we will most likely stay in the ballroom tomorrow night. The ballroom was made with no windows and was made for hurricane evacuation. Instead of asking if your resort that you have travel plans to is going to be affected, please think about all the people currently on the island as there is no way out unless you pay $1,000 per person. Thanks!"
"Kase - one of the issues with this forum is when you hit 'Reply', you're replying to the whole group and we don't know why you're actually responding to.That said, it appears most people with issues have been from Thomsons. People need to remember this in the future and consider other options."
@kenm1830 Will you now cancel or will you still go?

We have no problem with Thomsons at all and have used them year after year and never had a problem.We will be boarding our flight this Saturday on the Dreamliner for another wonderful holiday
UkfoxygolfWe've definitely waited far too long for this holiday to cancel. If it's safe I'm going. I feel lots are cancelling based on little info
"Kids were to go to Cayo Coco Wednesday Sept 13 but got cancelled the Sunday before with full refund from Sunwing. Booked the Monday for Punta Cana Sept 14....and now news says Air Transat is sending flights tomorrow Wednesday Sept 20, a day early. Haven't heard from them yet."
Sensatori resort is being evacuated first thing tomorrow. We are being taken 3 hours away as a precaution.
Sunwing is evacuating us tonight. They're sending 4 planes to pick up everyone scheduled to leave between today and Saturday as far as I understand. I'm flying out at 1:30am to Toronto I met ppl here that used alligent as well and they're being told to bunker down in their rooms and wait it out.
GCWWe are on the Thomson flight which is now 8am Friday KafebrindleLooks like we are on the same flight
"I'm going tomorrow, but really I don't know what to do"
Is that Punta Cana My son and girlfriend there at Bahia Principe and been told they will not be moving. They are with Thomson.
"Hope this helps......The Dom Rep is on hurricane watch not hurricane warning and some parts only on tropical storm watch.A Hurricane Warning is in effect for : Guadeloupe Dominica St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat U.S. Virgin Islands British Virgin Islands Puerto Rico, Culebra, and ViequesA Hurricane Watch is in effect for : Saba and St. Eustatius St. Maarten St. Martin and St. Barthelemy Anguilla Isla Saona to Puerto Plata Dominican RepublicA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for : Antigua and Barbuda Saba and St. Eustatius St. Maarten Anguilla MartiniqueA Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for : West of Puerto Plata to the northern Dominican Republic-Haiti border"
I hope we are all still able to go and still enjoy!! and don't want to cancel unless really neccessary. Wishing everyone safe travels and wishing those stuck over there a safe stay.
Wishing all the residents safety & little damage. Dominica sadly got pounded.
ukfoxygolf - this has changed and hurricane warning is now in place from pc to pp
UKFoxWhen did they downgrade it? last I saw here www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?coneit was still listed as hurricane warning for PC and the northern part of DR and tropical storm for the south. Do you have a new update?
That news was all on Dominican live website showing all the warnings for each country
Got a link please?
"As of 4pm they are calling it an ""extremely dangerous category 5""http://www.nhc.noaa.gov"
Dominican republic live.com
No evacuation here at Excellence El Carmen but lots of boarding up windows and plans to move people out of ground floor rooms. Suspect we will find out a lot more tonight.
"Hi PC Mike and the PC community!We were planning to fly to PC, Whala!Bavaro resort on Sep 23 for a week-long vacation. Now United offers me either to postpone the flight by one week for the same ticket price or cancel it with credit to be used within a year. As I am checking the Google Satellite map, it seems that Whala!Bavaro beach (El Cortecito area) is not protected by the reef and therefore hurricane/high wave damage may be severe enough not to be cleaned up within 2 days. Am I right? What about within 9 days if we arrive on Sep 30? Or should I cancel that hotel (can do w/o penalty till Wednesday night), and book another relatively inexpensive all-inclusive beach resort in a safer area? All we are interested in is beach, sun and swim. Thanks for advice and best of luck to those of you who are in PC now!"
People staying at thr Riu Bachata in puerto plata had a letter from management this afternoon saying hurricane maria would be passing 125 miles off the coast in next 48 hours .
Update from here at breathless hotel management are now considering an evacuation. Drats
Plan to be in Punta Cana on Sun a party of 8 for the Hard Rock Casino what do you think my chances my travel will not be cancel I am so looking forward to this trip
Breathless and on your management considering moving us currently. Still people partying here but steps and precautions being made.
Personally I think your be pk for Sunday. We travel Saturday. Next 24 to 30 hours we will know more but it's looking like the island will have a close call with probable local flooding but not as bad as first looked yesterday but still to early to say .
"Thomson have changed our holiday for us we are now going to Mexico, they did offer us a full refund though but decided to stick with Mexico as it was cheaper than Dom rep and we've got a five star hotel, so happy days for us"
We are at hard rock hotel now they are not worried. Unfortunately Thomas cook have decided to cut short our holiday and send us home tomorrow. The hotel have been fantastic and found out we were leaving early themselves Thomas cook never told us and still have not made the effort to contact us directly. Apparently they are sending staff tomorrow to tell us face to face even though were being picked up at 10.30am tomorrow. What they planning to do bang on our doors tell us we have 30 mins to pack and leave. Thomas cook are a disgrace.
Suppose to arrive Thursday for a week but southwest in Chicago has cancelled all flights Thursday to PC. Thinking of rescheduling for Friday night or Saturday AM but worried about the forecast showing rain all this week and next week. Thoughts about the continuous rain forecast?
"As of 5:00 pm EDT: (Hurricane Center)Hurricane warning in effect for North DR area.Hurricane predications for the DR, (More specific Bavaro beach area):4' to 6' storm surge.4"" to 8"" rainfall, (isolated 12"")Wind speeds still to be determined based on how the Hurricane reacts when it hits Puerto Rico.(Hopefully down to Category 3.)Fingers crossed that it weakens and moves to a more NW pattern.Stay safe!David"
"Amanda k I will let pcmike answer that one. All I can say is it shows that most days , it showed it last time we went and was wall to wall sun every day with an odd storm or shower at night time"
"Amanda K - the last few years whenever I've travelled to the Caribbean the forecast has always shown rain for every day and like UKFoxy says, it usually ends up being days of full sunshine."
"I asked PCMike similar questions and am awaiting a response, we fly out of chicago next week and I am a bit concerned about flooding or damage from the storm. I can tell you this will be our fourth visit to the DR and the forecast has always shown rain-like every single day:) and our trips are always perfect...sunny and warm."
Staying at sensatori. Understand moving ground floor guests out but the rest of us on second and third floor should be allowed to stay. We all know it's going to do what Irma did which is basically nothing to Punta Cana.
"""We all know it's going to do what Irma did which is basically nothing to Punta Cana""Personally, I would not be too sure of thatI hope not but this looks like it s going to be much closer"
We are expecting to travel to Secrets Royal on Monday 9/25. I know that all precautions are being taken to ensure the safety of guests and staff so do not get scared or worried. Have faith and lets wait until Friday to make sure all is well!
"We're expected to arrive Friday afternoon into PC and staying at EEC..we're not worried about the hurricane itself because it will be passed, but the aftermath and land conditions is what concerns us..We already cancelled once for Irma it's just so frustrating doing it all over again."
"(At flip flop man I messed up the reply)I believe a storm surge is the bigger threat than the winds even so I believe sensatori is built we'll enough to cope with said winds. On the flooding NHC said 4-6ft storm surge, where I was stood today on the beach I think the pool alone is at least 6ft off where the tide meets the sand.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Watching the progress every couple of hrs. We don't fly out til 5/10 but still worried sick incase we end up cancelled as nowhere else we want to go! Really hope it turns away from DR and not towards, also slightly worried incase another category 5 hits when (if?!) we do get there!"
We are supposed to leave 10/01 on our honeymoon getting a little worried with all these hurricanes!
BBC Weather showed it hitting DR in Samaná Bay area - but whole system extends down as far as PUJ area.
"I don't think the BBC weather graphics necessarily depict the wind-speeds accurately on the map - they also usually show precipitation, which is much wider than the hurricane. I'd stick with NHC tracks and various models, such as the European one it's often based on.."
Travelling to La Romana in early October. Staying at the Viva Wyndham Dominicus Beach. Any reported damage? Thanks....
No one has reported any damage in PC or Bayahibe yet- it might be because everything is damaged even communications or there is a chance that the reason could be that the hurricane has not arrived to DR yet
@Warrenk99 Hurricane doesn't arrive for a while - a day at least - I'd wait until Friday morning before asking about impact.
Danmaxx you are hilarious! You should do some research before you post anything. I would remove this comment if I were you...
"First time poster, long time reader... We are scheduled to fly into PC on 9/26 and staying at Chic. We can apparently cancel the resort but the flight is a bit tougher. Does anyone think there is any wisdom to switching to a different resort? I saw PC Mike post about the susceptibility of the Chic area to high water levels. Maybe head south and east? Or nah?"
"""No one has reported any damage in PC or Bayahibe yet- it might be because everything is damaged even communications or there is a chance that the reason could be that the hurricane has not arrived to DR yet""Maria is still about 24 - 36 hours away from island at the momentwww.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at5.shtml…"
"So, Riu Palace Bavaro have not spoken to anyone at the hotel, only stuck a notice on the lifts and by reception saying to stay away from the beach the next 48 hours. Not sure if I should be concerned as I read on tripadvisor that other hotels are boarding up or evacuating. Or relieved that it might not be so severe here. Our Thomson Rep, though really lovely, had no info either. Today was a pretty hot and humid day, looking a bit cloudier and windier now. I'll follow on here and update if necessary. Stay safe people x"
"We are in the grand palladium palace block 82 and we were getting quite worried as it's nearest the beach, just came back from the pool to a note that they are moving us to block 65 at the back of the resort which I'm relieved about. Also the normal storm info about the times things are closing, collecting a breakfast picnic at dinner tomorrow in case we can't leave the room the next day etc etc."
Great shame when some people need to read social media to get information instead of from their holiday rep or resort
"Update from Management, Palladium PC, Palace, Bavaro, Royal Suites TurquesaDear Guests,The National Meteorological Office (ONAMET) maintains an ALERT for hurricane conditions from La Isla Saona to Cabo Engaño (La Altagracia) and from Cabo Engaño to Puerto Plata, as well as an ALERT for tropical storm conditions from Puerto Plata to Bahia of Manzanillo (Monte Cristi). An alert means that at least one or two dangerous effects associated with a tropical cyclone can affect areas under alert in 48 hours or less, such as heavy rains and winds, and abnormal waves. The guests located at the blocks closest to the beach will be relocated following the recommendations of the government authorities, and the beach will be closed from 14:00 tomorrow.Wednesday morning beach restaurants will not offer lunch service.Tomorrow evening the restaurants near to the beach will be closed (Bohio, Chef Raffele, Steak House La Parrilla and El Arrecife). For dinner, we offer service at the usual buffet restaurants and à la carte restaurants of the Grand Palladium Bavaro (Bamboo, El Tapeo and La Adelita). The hotel’s forecast is mainly to keep the main buffets of each hotel opened. However, as a preventive measure, at the Wednesday’s way out dinner, we will be supplying with breakfast picnic to every single room. The dinner time will be from 17:30 to 20:30.By doing this, we will be preventing not to force anyone to leave the room due to the unfavorable climatological conditions. Guests should pick the picnics up at the buffet of the hotel where they are hosted. Guests hosted at Grand Palladium Bavaro should collect the pack at La Catedral Restaurant. In case of guests hosted at Gran Palladium Punta Cana and Palace should collect the pack at Las Torres Restaurant. Finally, for all those guests hosted at TRS should pick it up at The Royal Gourmet Restaurant.We recommend you go to your rooms after dinner. From 20:30 onwards the bars, restaurants, theaters, disco and room service will not offer service.According to the development of the weather conditions, we inform you that the schedules of our services may vary.We suggest and recommend that you act responsibly in the face of this natural phenomenon.Tomorrow morning, they will be receiving another bulletin updating the development of this meteorological phenomenon.

"Tyler P, I'm supposed to be arriving there with my husband on Sunday afternoon, same resort. Keep us posted on how things look there?"
Arriving at cap Cana on sept 27th no trip insurance first time going to Caribbean and we're not sure what to do or even what we can do. Any advice would be appreciated
I think that some people think Dominica and the Dominican Republic are the same. Dominica was hit hard
All you can do is wait and see what happens. If it's a direct hit much different then brushing by the coast.
"@ flip flop man, unfortunately that's where I learned that I'm being evacuated The resort here is not anything, and I even asked if I ride out I'll be in the hook for $100 per person per night. Kinda sucks. A lot of guests here are not even getting evacuated. Mostly airlines out of USA are being left in the dark Very sad"
intellicast.com/Storm/…Sadly Puerto Rico will take a hard hit but still looks like it will be to the north of PC. Fingers and toes crossed.
"Thoughts and prayers with you, praying for safety across all areas."
"I am glad to hear some hotels like the Palladium are keeping their guests informed. Unfortunately, Riu Palace Bavaro is not one of them. I pray for us all to stay safe and stick it out."
Same here. Hopefully everything is ok. I thought we got lucky dodging Irma now this. Sucks.
"Amanda K....We are here in PK suppose to take that Southwest flight back to Chicago Thursday afternoon....they haven't cancelled us yet, and had no flights we would get on today or tomorrow or added flights. Guess they are leaving us stranded? We tried and spoke to them this morning with no plan by them that we know."
"Is anyone staying at the Catalonia Royal Bavaro? We are scheduled to fly out Friday, arriving in Punta Cana at 1:35pm"
Southwest advisoryhttps://www.southwest.com/html/advisories/sw…
"Hi, who did you buy your insurance from? We're due to fly out next month but just in case something else happens... I have yet to buy travel insurance. Thanks!"
"Marie T, we are set to stay there as well! Supposed to arrive on Friday and hoping all goes as planned."
"My friend is currently staying at ""The Occidental"" in PC and the resort has not been good at all about providing information, My friend told me that she was told that ""everything will be ok"" and that ""God will protect"". Not good enough and if the resort had been more forthcoming earlier in the week, it would have given more time for those who chose to could get out."
"Checked into Breathless today around 3:30PM, we were the only ones on the shuttle. Resort is at about 30% occupancy and they are making preparations in leu of Maria."
"Dominica is not the Dominican Republic. Damage to PC will be assessed Thursday evening into Friday. Storm surge will be an issue. Anything can happen, it could do little damage like Irma but what's wrong with being ready? Extra food in the room, charged cell phones, candles and matches or lighter, looking for emergency phone numbers and contacts while internet is still running, etc. Cancel if you can in order to get 7 glorious days instead of 3-4. If you are there be ready. The old saying, better safe than sorry applies here very well.Prayers and fingers crossed."
"Cina...in respect, you would have to be totally removed from the media to not know that a hurricane is coming. What are they to tell you earlier in the week than what 95% know? Guess what? Right now I have not moved anything from my yard...have not taped any windows...etc. That will be tomorrow.There is still a lot of unknown out there and time to deal with it.As for ""getting out, that is not the responsibility of the resort in any means...it is the company who they booked with. CheersPCMike"
"Hi PC Mike! The all inclusive Occidental package does not include wifi or internet. The first my friend heard about Hurricane Maria was when I told her over the phone on Monday. They then tried to check with the resort and were told ""everything will be ok"". I sure hope that proves to be true Good luck and good safety is wished for you all."
My friends arrived in PC on the 10th so they really didn't have access to info. They had no idea that Hurricane Maria was coming.
"622, enjoy"
"Good evening. Just about to go out for pizza with the girls. The community around me quietly is going about some ""minor"" preparations. Most hoses have opted for tape on the windows and a very few with plywood.Waiting for the 8pm update, but I honestly expect little change i the projected path, which will leave Maria 50-60 miles of our north east.Cloud movement is now north to south as expected with a sytem approaching from the east. A random shower but that is normal for this time of year.A special note to my good buddy Sailman....the sunset was beautiful tonight!!!! Even across the tree line!I will repeat once more...I believe our biggest risk will be waves on the beach and a good number of resorts have already taped off the beach areas. Tomorrow, resorts will go into protection mode, moving people from vulnerable rooms and preparing as they always do for an event like this.PLEASE STAY OFF THE BEACHES!!!!!!!I would also like to make an observation. We have seen the damages from other islands during Irma and some of Maria. What is being destroyed are wooden framed houses. Very few houses here are wooden framed...or roofed. The vast majority are concrete. This includes your resort rooms. Yes...some thatched roof buildings could see damage, but that is actually easily replaced.I will type more shortly, as I am getting hounded by my 2 princesses to go to the pizzeria!CheersPuntaCana Mike"
When did they arrive? Have they not talked to other guests? I cannot talk to a visitor for the past 4 days whom does not bring up the hurricane.
"I am in the occidental now and evacuated tomorrow morning,i don't now for you ré friends because somes are leaving and somes are stay don't now why"
Hello Mike. Myself and 37 family members will be traveling to Punta Cama on November 9th. Do you think those plans will co me to pass?
Enjoy pizza with the girls and be safe Mike.
Hey we are slated to arrive on Sept 30 to PC. Praying all will be ok and that it will pass to the north as expected.
We're currently in Punta Cana and have been told air transat is arranging an evacuation flight tomorrow at noon
Sorry if someone(s) were affected by my comment. There is something that is call irony or sarcasmEdited: 2 years ago 
"Mike,Enjoying your posts very much. Question for you or anyone else with experience. I know you can't predict the weather and might have already answered this question ( a lot of posts to look through). Is weather usually yucky after a hurricane? We are set to fly out Sunday.We do have the opportunity to switch destinations but are really looking forward to the DR,But if the days after a hurricane are typically rainy we might switch. Thank you in advance"
"It doesn't look as if it's going to pass to the north. It's a big hurricane and the winds are now 175mph.If you have an opportunity to switch, maybe take it. The south coast near Bayahibe looks a good bet, although anyone from the UK would find better, much more secure weather and equally warm sea in Cyprus at this time of year.This is clearly going to be a hectic hurricane season, very like 2004 or 2005 and the Caribbean just doesn't feel like a safe option, especially while sea temps are still so high.Video of HM's path from Guardian websitehttps://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/…Edited: 2 years ago "
"This is a strong storm. The eye is very small (11 miles) and well-defined. While it may not directly hit PC (and I'm crossing my fingers for all there that it doesn't) it does not take that much for a storm to shift 50 miles - ask my friends on the West Coast of Florida.I will be pleasantly surprised if PC gets away as easily as it did through Irma. To Mike and all there, I'm wishing you the best and hoping you get off your island mentality long enough tomorrow to stock up on some food and water and board those windows. :PCheers."
Westjet allowed me this morning to change my trip to BP Cayo Levantado Samana from week of Sep 23 to Dec 23. A lot more expensive but well worth spending Christmas on the beach instead of snow in Toronto. I hope you enjoy your trips and stay safe.
"We in South Carolina were not in Irma's path but had one very bad day with lots of flooding. Tides, everything comes into play. Take precautions, listen to your resort if you're there and be safe."
Good evening everyone. Hope all is well with you all. We suppose to be arrived in Punta Cana on Friday September/ 22 at 1:35 pm. Does anyone hear anything about the hotel Paradisus Punta Cana? Please give us some advice. Thanks!
"Jackie, Been through lots of hurricanes and the weather is gorgeous after a hurricane.However, you don't know if there will be damage, power outages or flooding. Our beach paths are still flooded here a week after Irma and she didn't hit."
"Hi PC Mike! my friends arrived there on September 10 and back then I don't even know if Hurricane Maria was seen as a potential problem. They have no internet or wifi and need to use expensive phone cards to make calls off the island, so when I reached them mid week last week, they had heard nothing about Maria. I've called ""The Occidental"" today to ask if people would be evacuated due to the hurricane and they sounded like they had no idea what I was talking about."
"I know my wife Lisa is reading this cause she is super worried, but we will be ten toes up in 6 days! God protect the people of DR, and get the bourbon ready for the kid!Brett M"
"Why even POST THIS THEN. It is of absolute no help, and in my opinion, rude. The person is simply asking for information and you have provided nothing of use. GO AWAY."
Thank you for the updates PCMike
KMK whom are you screaming at?Maybe you should go away. NO ONE knows where a hurricane is going. Calm down.Have a wine instead of a whine.
We (47 of Us) were scheduled to fly to PC on Thursday September 21st and Southwest Airlines has cancelled all flights going to PC. We are disappointed but will rescheduled for next year. Better Safe than sorry.
"Pizza was great! As can ONLY be the case in the DR...our internet and cable went down last night, thus I have been using my mobile hotspot as a back up. Claro says they are working hard on it but 24 hours later...no wifi! LOLBreeze has picked up a touch this evening...almost directly out of the north. Very comfortable right now as the rotation brings us cooler drier air. As the night progresses, the breeze will build, but not to problem levels. We will do our yard clean up in the morning..take down the hanging plants...etc. Still have not convinced Carmen that the living room would be a great safe spot for my motorcycles!Really not much to discuss that hasn't already been covered for the past 2 days.I did however, get a call from Canada from the government, basically asking what my intentions were and they strongly suggested leaving the area. That is not my intention as I live a good distance from the ocean in an area not known for flooding. The house is poured concrete...top to bottom,thus not too concerned about it blowing apart.I am very concerned...still...about waves. If the forecast is true, it will not be pretty in Bavaro and lesser so in Uvero Alto.CheersPCMike"
"Hi PCMike, Would you know anything about preparations/hurricane prognosis for the Samana area? Thank you, and stay safe!"
"Hi 2008Reunion, I just arrived home from Now Onyx earlier than expected. I can telll you for sure that Breathless has a huge convention center that is very well built and everyone from Now Onyx went there for IRMA as well."
Breathless has a large convention center....not a bunker. It is a secure building with no windows and strong doors. That is where they will be moved to.CheersPCMike
"Elmi...Samana has more to worry about than us due to the mountainous terrain. The same protocols would be taking place at resorts there, as well as the many smaller hotels."
"PCMike, thank you! We are scheduled to go to Grand Bahia El Portillo on the 23rd, so trying to figure out whether rescheduling is required - but most likely will wait till Thursday."
"Jackie...""Is weather usually yucky after a hurricane? ""Actually weather after a hurricane is usually very nice. It basically takes all the energy away and gives us sunny skies.CheersPCMike"
Hey Mike I am glad you had pizza with your girls. I there school tomorrow?
oops...it was supposed to be a reply to flipflop
"Mike, do you think that the resorts protected by the reef will have a problem with waves? I am scheduled to be at the Barcelo Palace on Friday."
Irene....yes...we are talking major surf.
"School is out until Monday, as I suspected the other day. Girls have a pile of homework...from mom and dad!"

They flew with Air Canada. The earliest they can book was Saturday. We were in the phone with them for quite some time earlier today.
We are currently at the dreams resort in punta Cana. The whole hotel is being evacuated tomorrow morning. Personally we are going to a quality inn in Santo Domingo others are going to alternative hotels. We have to take all our luggage in case we can't come back. It's our honeymoon so not ideal but at least we will be safer.
Thanks Mike. That makes me feel a bit better.
Thank you for the reassurance Alina! My son just messaged me and said they'll be transferred to Breathless for 5pm tmrw.
Thomson say there might be a possibility of flying back to the UK tomorrow (20th September) as there are a few seats left on the Punta Cana - Gatwick flight. We have been added onto the list and will get confirmation in the morning. Am I over exagerating by wanting to go back? Currently at the Riu Bavaro Palace where there is no hotel update or thomson rep info at all. I had to call the 24/7 thomson helpline which is +44 333 336 5147 if anyone needs it.Edited: 2 years ago 
One thing I forgot to mention. At times like these it is very important that you keep your documents either with you (preferred) or in a very safe place. If you do not have a ziplock bag to put them in (passports etc) ask at the resort. They MIGHT be able to help. You want to keep them dry. Should you loose or destroy your passport you are going to have a very hard time leaving the country...which simply adds to the stress you may already be under.Stay safe and prepared...PCMike
"@Ava20155. This directly from the Sunwing site today : ""The Dominican Republic is currently under a hurricane warning. All flights into Puerto Plata and Punta Cana have been suspended until September 22nd"""
Mike............you and your family stay safe. Hope you have enough cigars and rum! Thanks again for all the updates.
"I agree with you the wife and I are suppose to fly there on Sunday too and it's killing us if we have to change our trip again. First Irma now Maria, hopefully I won't be two for two on pushing back my trip."
"D; those are flights going into PC, Sunwing is sending more rescue flights tomorrow. It's hard to find on their site but they do go into more detail than that pop up thing they have that's useless lol.Important Update* As earlier advised, flight services into Punta Cana and Puerto Plata have been suspended until September 22nd. After reviewing the most up-to-date projections of Hurricane Maria’s path and strength, we have made the decision to activate our contingency plans and repatriate all passengers from the Dominican Republic in advance of the storm’s projected landfall. Please see updates below:- Customers scheduled to depart on the four Sunwing flights from Puerto Plata or Punta Cana on Tuesday, September 19th, will return to Canada as planned.- Customers scheduled to depart Punta Cana and return to Toronto on Wednesday, September 20th, will also return to Canada as planned.- We will be operating nine additional flights on Tuesday and Wednesday to repatriate all other customers ahead of the storm. Sunwing destination representatives will be in touch with all guests to confirm their flight details.We do not have any passengers in other destinations currently forecasted to be impacted, but continue to monitor the situation closely. The most up to date information regarding our flight schedules is available here: sunwing.ca/pages/en/flight-status-alerts."
"Hope everyone is safe, What is the status of the shacks-vendors by Ocean Blue and Iberostar Grande?"
They are likely to be a Kodak memory by Friday.
HiHope you were able to rebook.Me and my family were originally scheduled to fly through Sunwing from Toronto to Punta Cana from Sept 20-27th. The flight got cancelled.We were able to rebook for a November date.
A Sunwing flight out of Holguin Cuba is just passing my balcony now...another flight on its was from Montreal in about 1:45
Is that the Dreams Palm Beach that is being evacuated?
Be safe prayers for all we were just there from the 9th -16th.
Probably Dreams Punta Cana
We are at the Royal Suites Turquesa and they have moved everyone from the beach rooms to other rooms. They also have asked us to stay in our rooms after 8:30 tomorrow night through Thursday. Delta cancelled on us last second at 8pm tonight to be safe so we are riding this out. Be safe everyone.
"Hi Mike,Thanks for your precious information. We stay at Bavaro and have two small children. You say to stay away from the waves/beach: we will close us in our room, do you mean that waves can be so high to invade apartments? They're going to evacuate those apartments closer to the beach, we are relatively inside the resort. Still feel not prepared since the personal here tend to minimize and say it will 'simply be rain and wind'. Thanks again in advance! KatiaEdited: 2 years ago "
Your resort (Barcelo) is a very low property. I would be concerned in a ground level room when it comes to potential flooding.
We are staying at dreams Punta Cana and we are all getting evacuated at 8am tomorrow morning to Santo Domingo!!! Stay safe everyone!! X
"So air transat is scheduled to fly out at 9am tomorrow morning for all transat customers. Close to 2200 people being evacuated. Although air Canada has attached a good will policy to their evacuation flights for compensation given the last minute change, air transat has NO such policy. Our honey moon is 2 days in and we will be packing to leave the room at 5am, being cut short by 5 days."
"Thanks for all your valuable information, Mike. I have two queries:- If the forecasts remain the same and Maria is similar to Irma in terms of its path near 50 miles north to Punta Cana, how is the waves and flooding risk different in this case compared to Irma? Did you suffer from floods after Irma? I didn´t follow Irma consequences so closely as I only have tickets to PC for 9/24 and I have assumed PC was safe when I read Irma didn't touch ground.- Would any floods be expected to be solved within 15 days (timing that my airline - Latam - is offering to postpone the trip)?-"
"Air Canada evacuated us today. Europeans stay at the hotel. Canadians all evacuated. Wierd. Some of us came to resort yesterday! We had only 4 days of vacation. They gave us no choice. Water was high already in the morning, waves like in the evening. Nearby hotel was covering bars and glass windows with wood ppl said. Weather was good, no wind,sunny. We wanted to change vacation before leaving last Thursday but Air Canada said no. So we had to go. Worried about all that can happen. And it did. Vacation spoiled. The rep at the hotel said they will refund us rest 3 days of hotel. Don't know. We're home in Toronto safe after exhausting flight through Montreal. Some ppl had 3 connecting flights! Flight attendants at AC Rouge were very rude. No food even to purchase,just chips, nuts. I never will fly Rouge again. (Also very uncomfortable seats .) And never will I book vacation for autumn to Caribbean, hurricane season. I did not know. Agent at Red tag did not mention it to me. Also she sold me the wrong insurance. I know I am the one to blame. But she should also explain to ppl that Air Canada insurance is very different from the one I usually got -when I can change my vacation if I just want so. Be careful too ppl! Peace. Be safe. I pray for DR and its kind, nice, wonderful ppl!"
"Going to Punta Cana October 20-27. Haven't booked my flight yet, but have booked the hotel. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you, and God Bless during this crazy weather season."
UKFoxyGolf - this is why we cancelled!! I watched this storm before anyone even knew about it. Cat 5 now :(. Hoping for all the best. Cancel you trip and join us in Punta Cana in early 2018 so we can relax! Praying for all those affected!!Edited: 2 years ago 
Mike you sound more concerned by this storm than Irma...in particular the surf. What is the best case scenario vs worse case (in your opinion)...in regards to the resorts protected and not protected by the reef on Bavaro Beach?
Dreams is right next to us at onyx and breathless. Dreams evacuating tommorow and were still yet to be contacted by our agent.! Wife's very worried. Can u smuggle us on your bus!
Lots of info from Excellence El Carmen now. Stay off beach tomorrow with various places closed during day and a complete shut down (back to rooms) from 8pm. Can't see us being evacuated unless major shift in Maria's direction. Next 36 hours key.
MarkandkatieWe not cancelling and will be on our flight this Saturday . Both quite calm about it all to be honest. As long as she keeps her track
"Hi,Does anyone have information about the Zoetry Agua? Have guests been evacuated? Is this resort more likely to suffer longer-term damage?"
"Mike, thanks for all your updates. Where is the malia in relation to potential disaster/ flooding? I haven't seen too much about that resort or it's potential to get get flooded or beat up..."
We were supposed to leave tomorrow the 20th but flight was cancelled. Our friends that arrived today will be moved from Punta Cana to La Romana. My family cannot decide whether to cancel or try for next available flight...
I was curious about the Excellence El Carmen also..not ever being to the Dominican area I know it is a little more north of a lot of the other hotels..just wondering how bad it's suspected to hit there. And how the area will be Friday afternoon
"UkFoxygolfI am an optimist like you, but watching the storm coverage all day, I think we want Maria to not keep her current path but to turn north. I will be waiting for Mike's best and worst case scenario and updates before I board my flight on Friday. Hoping and praying for the safety of all who are there."
"We are here in punta Cana now staying at the hard rock our flights for tomorrow have been canceled, what our your thoughts PC Mike are we in a danger zone also my husband is diabetic and will need insulin thought packed more then enough but didn't is it possible to find here?"
Maria T I'm currently at the Catalonia royal bavaro and all I've had is a note through the door basically saying don't panic and that th hotel is taking precautions ( I've not seen any yet) no tapping of windows etc as yet. Our Thomson rep gave us a letter and didn't know much to be honest . Will see him around 11/12 today . Looks like we are staying put . I can't understand how some from U.K. are either been evacuated or flown home yet we have heard nothing ( we arrived Monday 18th)
"Wow the Hard Rock , from Sault Ste Marie Canada, $3700 For 1, 7 days, ouch.Edited: 2 years ago "
We too are supposed to leave the 23rd. We have been told too out our holiday hold until the 22nd to see if we cancel or not. Weather looks stormy for the week but here's hoping
"Out of curiosity if it does cause localised flooding what time scales do resorts work on for getting back to normal service and does that affect the tour operators decision to cancel you? We really don't want to go anywhere else and fly two weeks tomorrow, wonder if there is any flooding whether it would feasibly be sorted by then anyway?"
My sister is currently in Punts Cana and they have not been given option to be evacuated just stay put !
Which hotel Nessie?

"This morning the track is more to the north but the storm is huge. The wind speeds are said to be 170mph+ and the Governor of Puerto Rico is predicting a catastrophe especially for those who stay put:.Puerto Rico's public safety commissioner, Hector Pesquera, issued a stern warning to island residents.""You have to evacuate. Otherwise, you're going to die,"" he said. ""I don't know how to make this any clearer.""Flooding & mudslides in St. Lucia, damage in Guadeloupe & Montserrat have been reported. It looks as though it's missing the BVI , at the moment it's lashing St. Croix in the USVI."
Hi we're still going for remaining 9 days. Got offered mexico or Jamaica but they were £1000 extra so see you on plane row 7 a and b in premium!

@kenm1830 we decided to change to Jamaica for 11 nights and received a huge refund. We still fly on Friday. If you are still unsure they had a great last min deal for Royalton white sands. Either way have a great time and be safe everyone!!
"Hi Mike, We are staying at the Sensatori and are being moved at 9am to the Sheraton / Santo Domingo at which I believe is close to the sea, I know it is on a different coast however are we likely to see signs of the hurricane I.e flooding etc? Your responses during the hurricanes have been amazing, what a guy! Thanks,"
Santo Domingo is on the Caribbean coast and is diametrically opposite the expected landfall of Maria in the Las Terenas area - at the moment. If any place will be safe this will be the safest spot. It should be more sheltered from the expected winds.
"Me and the wife are set to fly out to Puerto Plata DR on Saturday from Gatwick, we're staying on cayo levantado, has anyone heard anything from either Thomson or Bahia principe on whether they are going to evacuate or cancel flights."
Muckykid Flights are operating as normal on the Saturday. Thomson have a statement on their website thomson.co.uk/destinations/…hurricane-maria
If the track is as predicted and it doesn't lose strength when hitting Puerto Rico (a possibility) then the Atlantic coasts of the DR will be affected on Thursday and afterwards. I wouldn't bet on POP receiving flights after Thursday.
SalemanIs POP the other airport?
"Cheers, I'll have a peep."
"Muckykid, on the Samana forum, might be some info.. I was talking to linda who is there through PM, and yesterday Cayo Levantado was being evacuated, she said she was told they were moving to Punta Cana.. some by boat, some by coach. She is there until in the DR until Friday.I hope everyone stays Safe!!Angie"
"Cheers, I'll have a peep. POP is Puerto Plata"

On our way to the airport for a 10 o'clock flight to punta Cana. Some people think we're nuts. Hoping for the best. Staying at majestic elegance. Stay safe everyoneEdited: 2 years ago 
Keep posting about dreams hotel if u can... Going there for a wedding in 2.5 weeks. Stay safe!
"POP = Puerto Plata, PUJ = Punta Cana. There are airports at La Romana and Santo Domingo which could be used for evacuation should POP & PUJ be out of action.Basically that's what happened on Cuba with Irma. Tourists from the Jardines del Rey area where the airport was destroyed were evacuated from Varadero."
"@Saleman""The wind speeds are said to be 170mph+ "" I am just making sure I understand a hurricane correctly... the high winds 170mph+ is just the eye of the storm, and Maria's eye seems smaller about 30 mile radius. so the 170mph would spread out around the 30 mile line? Would I be correct on saying that?Maybe I am wrong about her eye looking smaller, then some other hurricanes.I know of course, the whole outer storm has high winds and big rains, and could be devastating in most areas.ThanksAngie"
"""moving to Punta Cana.. some by boat""Not a chance they are coming to Punta Cana by boat. It requires a boat to get off the island ( a short ride) but from there it would be a 5 hour bus ride.CheersPCMike"
PCMikeupdate on the path and impact?4star now and looks like is a bit right.?Edited: 2 years ago 
"Wind speeds are the top speed at the eyewall, which is very small and usually recorded in the northeast quadrant of the rotation. The eye itself is an area of dead wind. As the eye passes over you go from strong winds...to no wind at all...to much stronger winds."
"@angie g - If you look at the various models - they are showing wind speeds of around 50-60mph with gusts of 70-90mph - depending if you look at the US or EU models. Have a look here - you can click through the models and forecast times:https:/…20170921-0600z.htmlPC Mike has pointed out, the strong winds are at the top right of the eye, with the weaker side always being bottom left - so that is a bit comforting to the Dominican Republic."
I've found this a useful site showing the proposed tracks from the various forecasting agencies. All these tend to show Maria passing to the North but the wind speeds on land don't look too bad - I guess it's the storm surge and flooding that may be worst!You can adjust the time via the box to the left and the forecasting agency fom the box at the top!https:/…20170921-0600z.htmlDonEdited: 2 years ago

I have been reading all the posts. As l have family in punta Canta. The ones from Mike are interesting and informative. What l would like to know how is the island going to be affected as so many different posts Any information would be appreciated as very worried . I pray everyone stays safe.
"Good morning to all. Had a somewhat restless night as a thousand things ran through my head. Coffee kicking in right now.It was as expected. a dry and light breeze night. The winds remain out of the north with much heavier cloud cover. The road at my place is bone dry.Maria has held her course over the past 24 hours, with the eye remaining a predicted 60 miles off Punta Cana to the northeast. She went through an eyewall replacement last night, which has calmed her down a bit, but still very worrisome for Puerto Rico.Interaction with Puerto Rico should further de-power Maria, and forecasted winds(max) once across the island drop 15mph. Still strong, but a bit battered.Hurricane strength winds (64knots or stronger) currently expand out 35 miles to southwest of the eye. With Maria tracking 60 miles away, that gives us a very good buffer zone.Winds today will start out around 15-20mph this morning, increasing to 25 to 30 later in the day and remain in the 30-40 range overnight (Maria's closest point). There will be some higher gusts. Once we get to the 5pm positioning, I will have a much clearer idea of expected wind speeds overnight.Another good thing (like Irma) is that as the winds strengthen locally, the wind will be coming out of the northwest and southwest, which means it has to cross a good amount of land before getting to PUJ. It also means no damaging winds directly onto the beach.Rainfall predictions continue to fall. Original forecasts called for 14 inches in the region...now down to 2 to 4 inches.Now the downside....waves still predicted to be large coming into Punta Cana. I cannot stress enough, that the beach is not the place to be today and tomorrow. I do fully expect some damage from the waves. I hope I am totally wrong!So, that is about it for now. I am still on my back up internet wifi, thus have to post sparingly.CheersPCMike"
BBC 10am GMT/UTC news said slight diminishing as Maria approaches Puerto Rico.
"Hi PCMike,Been following since page 1 so thanks for all your info We're due to stay at Dreams Palm Beach PC - arriving on Tuesday - do you think this hotel is susceptible to bad flooding? Thanks again,Jake"
"""What l would like to know how is the island going to be affected as so many different posts""Not certain what the question is...could you rephrase?"
@ Jake....Dreams Palm Beach is prone to flooding. But more from rain...which seems to be diminished at this time.
"I was staying in punta cana bavaro and was evacuated yesterday with westjet. Sitting in the Toronto airport now awaiting my connection back to Newfoundland. I hope that Maria doesn't do much damage. Good luck to all the people in her path and fingers crossed nothing happens to the locals homes and familys, good luck all."
"Angie...not certain where she is getting that info from.""""Others will be taken by boat, up the coast, because it is easier than a long bus ride to Puerto Plata""""A boat ride from Smana to Puerto Plata would much more time than driving...MUCH MORE. It would also be the most unsafe way to get to Puerto Plata, as the seas have already kicked up to uncomfortable levels.I think what they mean is that they will take a boat from the island to the mainland (approx 1 mile) and then take a bus to Puerto Plata."
Thank you so mush for this post. Really appreciate the information they you are giving us.
"I was due to fly to Punta Cana tomorrow (Thursday) at 12.55 from Manchester but it's been cancelled. Was staying at the Be live Collection Canoa in La Romana although cannot find any updates from them online. We're thinking of rebooking and going on the 5th October. I'm led to believe with the side of the island the Be Live is on, there will be minimal damage? Am I right?"
"@PC Mike - out of interest - would the various hotels be preparing for the storm surge specifically? i.e. would they be putting out flood barriers or sand bags between the beach and the hotels to limit water coming in? With Irma, I didn't see much of that reported, but I would guess they are being advised differently by the authorities this time.."
"@sailman""Atlantic coasts of the DR will be affected on Thursday and afterwards.""You forgot to mention your beloved Bayahibe, which will be facing strong surf as well of 8 feet tomorrow afternoon as the winds change to the south-southwest. Those in Bayahibe should also stay well away from the shoreline...especially Thursday. Could be a few boats parked on the rocks as well.CheersPCMike"
"Seb...they might sandbag some walkways into buildings, but that would be all. Simply not effective to do it on the beach itself."
"Hello PCMike,Thank you so much for your encouragements and wise words, they have been really useful for me.I am due to arrive to Riu Republica Hotel on Monday. Is this hotel at any risk of flooding?Thank you once again,Diana"

"Clgascoigne -correct , the Caribbean coast should suffer less damage, if any, if Maria continues on the predicted track passing Hispaniola to the north.Stayed at the Canoa nine years ago when they were building the Cadaques next door. Good sailing every day. We found the buffet restaurant very humid and airless."

They are taking good care of us so I know we will be okay.Looks like the weather for the remainder of our trip will be bad, though (we leave Monday). How is weather after a hurricane hits, does rain typically continue like forecasted?"
"PC Mike, thank you very much for your updates, I can not say how much important and helpfull your information are. You are very good man.Is it possible to meet you in PC? I willi arrive on Friday and would like to buy you drink for everything what you do for us :-)Lucie"

"We are also scheduled to arrive on Monday with a stay at the Riu Republica, I am hoping for the best but there are a few members of our party very nervous might consider going to Mexico if Sunwing gives a choice"
We are currently staying in Sensatori Punta Cana and we are all being moved to hotels in Santo Domingo this morning. Probably more as a precaution as they don't expect it to directly hit but will experience high winds and tropical storm conditions. Already windy here. Not all hotels are evacuating I believe but those not will be on curfews and confined to rooms.
It's crazy when I see people saying they couldn't get a flight out. I am home now in Canada. Left punta Cana at 1:30 this morning and the plane was over half empty. So many people left in the dark
"Ashlyn...your staff are like most others here. All those whom I know are very aware of the storm, but like the staff, we are not in panic mode...far from it. Very laid back right now. Just another day in paradise! LOLFact is, there is little that can be done other than what might have already been done or will be done today. Then we wait for the ride!CheersPCMike"
How close was Irma to Punta cana? With this one being 60miles north does anyone know the difference?
They were putting plywood up in the airport as a precaution

"Janine, That's a very enjoyable tour and it was our pleasure to meet Mike. Mike wishing you and your family a safe and gentle ride over the next couple of days."
"I just went to the Dreams Palm Beach reception desk and there's no evacuation set yet, I don't know where some of you got this information from. There's a meeting scheduled at 10:30 AM in the lobby, where we'll get more insight on what going to happen next."
"Hi Janine, We did the Munchies tour yesterday and It was absolutely superb. We had a great day. Bring school supples if you can and some sweets. I'm currently at Dreams Palm Beach and suppose I can help people in a limited way. It is windy here but dry. The hotel have called a meeting for guests at 10.30 and it looks likely that we will have to spend tonight in their conference centre. I've had no communication at all from British Airways. To be fair I'm not too worried. All will be fine. I trust Mike and will continue to follow his advise. Richard."
I'm planning a vacation in riu republika from 28 SeptemberShould I look for another holiday destination or should I be quiet?
"Kk, I'd wait a couple of days until the storm has passed. As long as there is little damage, no flooding and power it should be fine."
"Hi, our flight is on Monday from Manchester to DR, were supposed to be staying at Dreams punta cana.

Still hoping we will be able to dive sat or Sunday.I am in Bayahibe, and right now mostly cloudy sky's, calm winds. The hotel has given us paper explaining their plan, we are not being evacuated, but have been instructed not to leave our rooms tomorrow. All resturants have been closed today except for the buffet. The hotel has the ocean front rooms boarded up and most of the beds on the beach have been taken apart and moved."

PC Mike thank you so much for your updates. I have been reading your updates since Irma and appreciate the time you take to keep us all updated. We are going to Hard Rock for October 1st and am positive everything will be good:)
"Just incase this helps anyone, we are currently staying at Secrets Cap Cana, we arrived on Sunday 17th and are due to leave 28th . We are being evacuated this morning (20th) and the hope is that our return transfer will collect us from Santo Domingo at 11am on Friday to bring us back all being well. The staff at the hotel have all been exceptionally helpful and well organised here and we feel well looked after, I will update again throughout if I have any information to give, I know posts from those in the area during Irma helped me to understand what goes on in these situations better."
"#753: ""Looks like the weather for the remainder of our trip will be bad, though (we leave Monday). How is weather after a hurricane hits, does rain typically continue like forecasted?""Rain doesn't linger after a hurricane. Once a storm moves away, the weather turns nicer. In fact, it can be amazingly sunny and beautiful after a hurricane has gone thru, which can be in stark contrast to foliage thrown around a property and any possible damage that occurred.In most cases, the storm will be thru within 8 - 16 hours."
Kk- we will be at Riu Republica as well on sept 28th. Watching Maria and hoping all will be ok!!!
Hello Karen did you fly out? How is it? I am supposed to fly out Oct 3rd
Can you please post if you are able to dive this weekend! Praying everything will work out!!!
"I will post updates as I can. Friends of ours were scheduled to leave this afternoon on jet blue out of PUJ. Flight was cancelled they are stay extra nights here. Not sure on specific flights, but it looks like the cancellations are piling up for this afternoon into Fri."
"Scheduled to arrive in Punta cana Friday morning, sunwing has not cancelled flight. Fingers crossed everything will be ok"
"We are scheduled to fly out on Sept,22. Super nervous and watching the news constantly.. Who is currently in Punta Cana - be safe and keep us posted!"
"""Rain doesn't linger after a hurricane. Once a storm moves away, the weather turns nicer. In fact, it can be amazingly sunny and beautiful after a hurricane has gone thru, which can be in stark contrast to foliage thrown around a property and any possible damage that occurred""That is not always the case as some are very slow moving or stall and some have lots of rain sitting behind them and that was the problem with Jeanne when it hit PC"
good thing you aren't a meteorologist
We are currently staying in the Hard Rock and the staff don't seem to concerned. The excursions have been cancelled for Wednesday and Thursday but everything should go back to normal on Friday. We haven't been told to take shelter as yet and they feel the winds will peak at 60-70mph
"I'm due to go to the Bahia Precipe Bavaro, Punta Cana on the 27th - what is anyones opinion on the location of this hotel/likelihood for damage/flooding? Thank you."
"My Girlfriend who lives in Bavero said Punta Cana is the most at risk, especially on the coast side as the waves are predicted to be very high and rain will be heavy, she's urging people flying Friday to be careful as well as Friday's rains could be stronger (maybe Mike can confirm that) but she's more worried about this one than Irma, Irma didn't phase her.I hope all whom are there stay safe and hope it is not to bad for who lives there, you may lose a day or two of Vacation but keep in mind there are people there who have to deal with the aftermath while you get to go home."
"Yeah, but that was all part of the hurricane. As I said, once the storm moves away...Many people believe that hurricanes can cause rain to last for days after the storm moves away, as seen by some worried people in regards to the weather after a hurricane. That was the point I was trying to make.And yes, if you look hard enough, it's possible find very rare exceptions to everything. Jeanne was a slow mover. But it's really not necessary to bring up a storm from 13 years ago to point out the extremely rare exception. People are worried enough about this storm and the effects of this storm.This one isn't showing any of those tendencies. It'll move out."
I hope everyone stays safe x
We are staying at Nick Hotel and they have been very calm and organized. Since yesterday evening we were alerted of the evacuation this morning to Santo Domingo. The hotel is bracing for impact by removing all things that are not concreted in the floor or could become projectiles. Throwing chairs and tables inside the pools and removing all signs and posts from the pathways. Staff has been great besides the circumstances. Winds are picking up but nothing major at this time. Hopefully will be back by Friday and airport not damage to fly back home Saturday.Edited: 2 years ago 
My point was that some people seem to think that they will have a storm one day and then life will be back to normal the next. All I am saying is that it might not be so be prepared
"I appreciate all of the information coming from PCMike! I was getting nervous following Maria on the news, but your updates have helped keep me from panicking. Stay safe! My girlfriend and I are heading to Dreams Palm Beach on the 26th and have been excited for this trip for a long time. Hope to see some of you there next week!"
Thoughts of people arriving in Punta cana on Friday?
tvaccaro---where do you fly out of? Are you still planning on going?
"Thomas Cook had brought flights forward to today which were due to leave Punta Cana tomorrow. They have just told guests flight has now been cancelled since Maria ""changed direction overnight""."
"Ashley, you will have to wait and see if there is damage, flooding, power. Won't know this until the storm passes."
A travel company blatantly lying to their paying customers should be the #1 reason why people should search out a new travel agency next time they take a trip.
"I keep reading different sites giving different times, do you know when it's supposed to hit and Pass?"
"PC Mike--thank you sooo much for the updates!! While my husband is listening to the news, I'm listening to you!! We are scheduled to fly into Punta Cana Int'l Airport on Friday. We are staying at Catalonia Royal Bavaro. I am very bad with geography, I don't know where the hotel is in location to the airport, or where on the island we will be staying. I don't even know when exactly the hurricane is supposed to hit that part of the island. If anyone is staying at the Catalonia Royal Bavaro or anywhere close to it, if you could post updates it would be greatly appreciated. And if anyone is scheduled to fly into PC Int'l airport on Friday, let me know if you are still planning on going. Thank you in advance for any information!! Stay safe!!"

The weather app shows 90 mph winds and rain starting tonight Wednesday and going to 70 and 60 mph all day Thursday
"Back for a few minutes! Morning preperation chores done. Potted plants and hanging plants now inside.

They are 1 foot high...should be more than enoughNothing loose around the house.In a few minutes...off to the Corner Bar for a Pre Maria Pint.This morning (where I am just west of the airport) overcast skies...some light drizzle and a nice breeze. Contrary to the weather wizards at Thomas Cook....Maria has not changed course one bit and still forecast to pass us to the northeast overnight.No word on the ocean right now, but will take a peak when I am close.CheersPCMike"
"LOL this thread is just like Irma, nobody takes time to read posts that already explain what's going on, especially Mike's informative updates. How is anyone to know what it will be like in Punta Cana on Friday or Saturday or in November when the storm hasn't reached them yet."
Just a note about Ventusky and Windy. Both show that the current breeze in my zone is 26mph....not a chance! 12 to 15 maybe all morning.Don't believe all you see on some of these fancy websites.CheersPCMike
"Mike, say hi to the guys at Steve's, enjoy your pint(s)??? lol"
"Also note, Windy by default shows the EU model, and that updates every 12 hours, so it’s currently still showing 7.15UCT forecast update from over 7 hours ago."
Mike thanks for the ongoing calming influence and immense knowledge. Perhaps Thomas Cook might want to start calling you before they communicate anything LOL
Jeremy DWhat do you how is it looking?Probably looks the same as yesterday lolThe hurrican has not hit or passed yet
Sleep...that is total BS. There have been at least 10 flights landing and taking off this morning and 3 more on the way...the furthest not to land until 430pm.
"We're going as well on the 23rd.September.Not sure , but it could well get cancelled.Thomson advised me to look at website tomorrow!We are going to Puerto Plata region.Just a waiting game.Lovely country have been a few times.Hope we get to go.see you on the plane.xx"
"Our trip to Punta Cana is schedule for November 6th. Should we just hold tight and see what Maria does to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic?"
purplerain11Are you flying from Gatwick at 10.30 saturday as we are on that flight too. At present time all is ok for weekend.No cancelations etc for sat or sun.Packing tomorrow night as staying over in gatwick friday.Foxy

All guests attended a meeting at 10.30 and we going to spend the night from 5pm in the convention centre near the front lobby of the hotel. They have asked all guests to pack their cases and leave them in their bathrooms. I'm pretty sure this is all standard precaution stuff and nothing at all to worry about.

I am wondering if some kind of TripAdvisor status (beyond his current rating) can be bestowed on Punta Cana Mike as his advice through these hurricanes has been priceless.
"All canadian airlines are coming in empty and taking out its vacationers ahead of Maria, they have been doing so since yesterday. Could account for some of the activity."
"yes Steve's is open, why do you think Mike is headed there for a pint with the boys?"
Breathless onyx now windy and rainy she's on her way fingers crossed for all the locals homes. I'm sure we will be back on the loungers in 48hrs :)

"PCMikeHow do you compare Imra and Maria, path and weather conditions? Which is closer to DR?"
Thomas cook have now cancelled flights saying we have realised it's to dangerous to fly this afternoon. I did tell them that yesterday. Again I found the information out first then phoned them. So apparently we are definitely leaving Friday afternoon.
Brilliant incompetence from Thomson starting to dawn on guest who've been evacuated from sensatori to the Sheraton. Thomson didn't want us to stay at sensatori because we'd have been on lockdown. Get to the Sheraton and we're told we're on lockdown for tomorrow. And you have to pay for wifi. And drinks. And everything that was basically inclusive.
We are coming to the Hard Rock on Sunday 9/24. Thanks and I appreciate any updates after the storm passes.
We are at sanctuary punta cana. So far no evacuation. We are being moved to the tallest building in hotel rooms farthest from the beach. We still have plenty of food and booze...
"@Liam B - WOW, people are trying to move you for your own safety, with unpredictable weather conditions, that even Thompson cannot predict - and you are complaining that you have to pay for a drink and WiFi? Why don't you give us all a break and just claim the extra costs on insurance..."
I am complaining because the following hotels are not evacuating on our stretch Catalonia Royal Bávaro - which is thomson Excellence El Carmen Royal Suites TurquesaGrand Palladium Majestic elegance Dreams palm beach I wanted to stay. Ride it out. Wasn't allowed because thomson didn't want us confined inside but then transfer us 3 hours to another hotel not as good as our own and will confine us inside. That is ridiculous.
Some people!!!!!!!During such extremes of weather it is better to stop drinking anyway and be fully alertHow do you know what all the other properties are doing as things can change by the hour and I am sure the likes of Excellence will have people well away from the beach and most likely in the main buildingEdited: 2 years ago 
"Same as me, just taking it calmly now.What will be, will be.On Friday night I'm going to be sitting at the bar in the premier inn at Gatwick looking forward to my holiday on Saturday to cayo levantado until some bod from Thomson tells me otherwise"
So I was supposed to leave Monday to punta cana. Ending up cancelling my trip. Anyone know a good last minute place to book with expected good weather for the following week at decent rate? All inclusive and prefer adults only (but not necessary to be adults only).I looked into Los cabos and they have good rates but I don't like that you can't swim in the ocean and the flight will be 9-11 hours. Also the places I looked at were all smoke free (I vape from time to time).Thanks.
"Does anyone know if ""Occidental Resort"" is being evacuated? Thanks!"
"MuckykidSnap , we also gonna be sat having a drink friday evening before we fly down on saturday.What will be will be, Can't change mother nature so just roll with it."

"Flip flop man. Excellence have been great so far. Decent information, days of preparation and clear times on curfews etc. All guests moved to 1st floor or above and anything that can move either cleared or pinned down. Options to stay in room tonight or go to central point. Staff posted to all buildings. Quite rightly they are stopping serving alcohol at 3pm and are currently moving spirits out of bedrooms. They know what they are doing and I completely trust them with their actions. I know you are also a big fan of the Excellence Group and, irrespective of what happens in the next 24 hours, I can't see anything I'd criticise them for."
Hello Thanks for the great updates Mike and everyone else.really helpful.Due to be travelling on Thursday 28th and staying at the NOW Larimar. Haven't seen this hotel mentioned. Would be good to know if the resort and area is hit severely before we travel out.Keep safe everyone.
Did you ride out the storm? How do things look there? My parents are scheduled to arrive there October 9th so curious as to what they will be arriving to. Hope you are safe!
My wife and I are due to fly this Friday to Dreams Palm Beach to celebrate her BD. We've been looking forward to this vacation for a while. United has not cancelled my flight yet. I guess it's a waiting game at this point until we know what demage the storm will cause. Hoping for the best and praying for everyone there. PC Mike you are the best. Im only here for your updates. Thank you so much!!
Yes....the regular crew is here...the Barcelo is open and the Don Lucas is lit.
Missy...the storm is just arriving....we will ride out the storm.CheersPCMike
"Stay Safe, following you continuously."
Good luck everyone!! You are certainly in our prayers!! PC Mike - you are amazing!
"Drinks at Steve's during the storm... that's what I call a ""wet bar""... LOL."
"""@Liam B - WOW, people are trying to move you for your own safety, with unpredictable weather conditions, that even Thompson cannot predict - and you are complaining that you have to pay for a drink and WiFi?"" To be fair, the weather conditions of this storm have been going as predicted. If Thomson cared about people's safety, they would've started allowing people to leave early, or at least giving them updates a few days ago. Instead, they waited, claimed the storm took an unexpected turn (which didn't happen, and they haven't clarified further) and now suddenly are moving people elsewhere. I'm wondering if they're even moving people from resorts that are otherwise allowing people to stay in their rooms."
Hi MikeHave a beer for all of us.I am not a specialist with hurricanes so maybe you can inform me or everyone about pressure (mb).I am currently getting figures showing that since 1.00am your time the wind strengthhas gome down from 175mph to now at 140mph and the MB from 909mb to 930mb.Hoping this trend continues.Foxy
Stay safe!
here is a couple of webcams you can watchhttps:/…they are from palladium hotel which is not far from steves
My husband and I will be traveling there on Saturday the 23rd. So far no warnings of cancellations from either our airlines or hotel. I checked with hotel yesterday. Maybe we will see you there! Good luck!
"Supposed to arrive on Sunday the 24th for 6 days at Secrets Royal Beach. And experience with this resort, or predictions on how things might look with waves and water? Husband and I have been looking forward to this trip for the last 6 months, and don't want to have to scramble at the last minute to re-book our honeymoon if things are looking up. Any suggestions are welcome!"
I also had email from Hotel to say all is still ok for our booking on saturday so just a waiting game now
"Thanks for updates Mike, me and other half currently Sat in our first floor room of riu bambu, pretty chilled out, hotel has told us we have to stay in our rooms from 6pm onwards"

As long as i am home by 5!
FYI...Maria is once again...further east. Good for us.
Good news! Stay safe.
Stay safe Mike. Enjoy those beers
Thanks for this forum as 8 of us are scheduled to arrive on Friday....for you already there stay safe
I have plan on coming in October 19 I'm worried about the island we staying at Chic in Punta Canta Dominican Republic
"Before Irma TC evacuated tourists from Jardines del Rey to Varadero and flew them back from there. The airport, the bridges and the hotels were destroyed by Irma. The tourists got off very lightly."
Are you serious? people here are worried because they are travelling within 2 days after Maria and youre worried because youre leaving the 19th of OCTOBER?! *sigh*Edited: 2 years ago 
"SalemanCuba took direct hit , this is not the case with Dom Rep as it stands Foxy"
lol - tourists!
Mike man thanks for any updates you can give as we scheduled to be there on Friday. American Airlines has already cancelled flights for Thursday to PC.
Wrong! - a small part of Cuba took a direct hit. Many areas escaped completely - that's how the tourists were evacuated.
The 19th October is a lifetime away and who knows what other weather fronts may have passed by in the meantime or be hovering ready to cause more worry!!!!did yo know it was the hurricane season when you booked?Edited: 2 years ago 
"Yes i know it was only the north coast , i was just saying that there are a lot of scared people reading these threads , so lets keep it real ,"
Exactly Sailman...we are in agreement.
It wasn't the north coast generally - all tourist resorts in Cuba are on the north coast. It was a specific area which was destroyed. If it hits the PC area then the same will happen - that's why tourists have been evacuated to the Caribbean coast.
Thank you PuntsCansMilk
trying to keep it as real as living here...and much more than a vacation to loose.
Fortunately it is extremely unlikely that tourists will suffer harm or death. The deaths occur usually among locals. So you're ok Milk.
Now a cat 3 on NHC
All power out in Puerto Rico.
Good news Foxy.
I've just seen that saleman. Awful videos and images
Latest advisory from NHC puts it at 95miles east of Punta Cana with sustained winds of 115mph - so much reduced from the 140mph they were forecasting.
"So far yes but still a long way to go , so fingers crossed it stays that way or less"
is hurricane Maria heading for punta can
Hi where exactly is that information on Maria being downgraded to Cat 3?
It looks as though the Hispaniola landfall will be around Las Terenas.
It's on the national hurricane centre website
"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT5+shtml/201758.shtmlCat 3, still on a northwest path."
"""It looks as though the Hispaniola landfall will be around Las Terenas.""A hurricane's landfall is measured by where the eye hits land.Maria's eye is expected to remain 90 or so miles away from Hispaniola/Dominican Republic."
Hey summers. So me and my wife are supposed to fly out Friday night arriving Saturday morning to stay at breathless. How long are you staying? Could I ask you for updates on conditions?
Is 90 miles further away than Irma was? I seem to remember Irma being 60 miles from the coast?
"We are supposed to be arriving at Dreams Punta Cana next Saturday! We are hoping for the best and praying you all will be safe!!! How have you liked the resort, minus the Maria excitement?"
"@Janine G - the NHC is putting it at 90miles away now, doesn't mean it won't get closer later."
"For the geographically challenged - Irma passed to the north of both Puerto Rico and Hispaniola but hit the extreme north coast of Cuba at Jardin del Reyes (aka the Cayos:- Coco, Guillermo, Santa Maria etc.) - no damage was done on the Caribbean coast nor on other north coast areas like Havana/Varadero.Maria has just hit Puerto Rico full on and this has lessened the winds. Passage over the warm ocean usually increases the winds. Maria LOOKS as though it will hit the north coast of Hispaniola."
"Hurricane force winds forecasted up to 90 miles away so if it stays on course, PC should be pretty safe."
"I'm currently in Grand Palladium Punta Cana, there is heavy rain and strong winds. The hotel have been excellent providing us with extra drinks and food for our room. The restaurants will close at 8.30 this evening and everyone has been advised to stay in their rooms until tomorrow. This makes us much luckier than others that have suffered."
Maria is expected to maintain cat3 strength until friday I guesshttps:/…1542142515851223
"@Saleman - I don't know where you are getting the idea that it looks like Maria will 'hit' Hispaniola, if anything, the latest NHC advisory has shown the path to have shifted east after Puerto Rico:http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at5+shtml/180045.shtml?gm_track#contents"
"Hello. Is anyone worried about that ""X"" on the National Hurricane Center website far to the east of DR which shows a 40-60% chance of cyclone formation? Possibly a next hurricane after Maria?"
"So you think the evacuations, postponements, and cancellations are unnecessary then? Airlines usually have good meteorological advice."
"@apaliszewski - the X on the NHC map is actually the remains of Lee - which might reform, but if you look at the 5 day forecast it is shown to go off way north into the atlantic if a depression forms. Nothing to worry about now."
"#917: Storm X: Satellite data indicate that the remnants of Lee, located about1000 miles east of the Leeward Islands, have become less organizedtoday and the associated winds have decreased below gale force.Environmental conditions are currently not conducive for tropicalcyclone formation, but they could become a little less hostile in aday or two. This low is expected to move northward over the centralAtlantic Ocean during the next few days."
Has there been any storm surge and flooding?
@Rusty9595 - Not arrived yet - best to ask tomorrow after it passes.. when people can take a look.
@SebastianD many thanks for that information
"News looks a bit better in the forecast:As of 1:00 pm from Hurricane Center; Maria is 95 miles east of Punta Cana moving NW at 12 MPH.Now a Category 3 Hurricane with sustained winds of 115 MPH.The Hurricane force winds extend 60 miles, so hopefully the wind speed will be in the 35 to 50 MPH range when it passes Bavaro.However, storm surge still forecast is 4 to 6 feet and rainfall amounts are now way up to 8 to 16 "" and possibly 20"" in some areas.Stay safe!David"
"#917 can you send me that link showing that?Unless you are talking about Lee? I had been checking up on it the last few days and all reporting I saw had Lee dissipating fairly quickly due to some wind sheers or what not, with no worry for landfall."
Why have we not been moved south like other hotels? I'm in PC right now
The same here in Iberostar Bavaro. Excellent service but the wind and rain seem pretty scary...
@Sebastianb @houlkz is at PC now at the Grand Palladium and was just wondering. I live in south Louisiana and know what the storm surge can do.....
#925: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/
@Rusty9595 - let's not encourage people to go exploring or out in the storm - let them sit it out.
"@saleman #917 There are a lot of factors in why some people have been evacuated, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Maria will actually make landfall. Based on responses from this thread, it seems like most evacuations have been ordered by the travel company people have hired for their vacation. They are expecting high winds, rain, and major waves, but the eye of the hurricane is not projected to hit land in Dominican Republic. Airlines have probably cancelled and postponed because it's hard to lane a plane in tropical storm-force winds. Lots of people, locals and tourists alike, are riding it out in Punta Cana. Cheers."
"Stay safe and dry everyone, hunker down and have a Presidente. Remember to tip your servers etc. as they are working hard to keep you safe and happy. Prayers for their families that are not with them during this time."
"@SalvatoreA as per the reply kindly provided by @slyguy and @SebastianB the ""X"" on the map is supposed to indicate the remnants of Lee. I was referring to the map provides on National Hurricane Center website."
We will be arriving at that same resort on October 3! I have been following this on and off since Irma! Hopefully Maria will weeken and there will be no more hurricans behind it!
Just had a quick look at the Ocean. It looks very angry. Storm surges continue to be biggest threat Mike?
No more alcohol being served at EEC from 3pm. Disappointed to see some guests using that as an initiative test and filling bags with unopened beers and wine. Some people are just......
"We cancelled for 27th arrival. I would have waited, but my husband wanted to cancel. We had insurance but didn't use it. We cancelled insurance, paid $100 in cancellation fees and have airline credits. This seemed the most economical way to do it since the insurance cost was $257."
"Hello everyone! I,m stying in Bayahibe be live canoa hotel and now is rather peacefull small Rain with light wind. MARIA IS DOWN TO CATEGORY 3. WILL BE OK, STAY SAFE EVERY ONE."
Palladium webcamhttps:/…
"Jamaica. We loved Jewel Dunn's River. Adult only, great food, excellent service"
"""We cancelled for 27th arrival. I would have waited, but my husband wanted to cancel.""That's a shame. By all indications travel this weekend will be absolutely fine, with sunny skies expected. A week from now no one will be talking about this storm."
"Mike,In your opinion are you anticipating more impact from this hurricane than Irma...sounds like you have more concerns with the wave heights and potential storm surge."
@houlkz are we meant to go down to dinner tonight? I'm there too and I know it said on the leaflet we had to go down to collect food packages but I can't see how we can venture out with how it is at the moment?! Working out whether I can survive on minibar nuts lol

Why would you book a holiday in hurricane season if you knew that a hurricane may come? Why would you consider doing 40mph in a 30mph limit. Risk and reward my Freind it's how the work functions.

@PuntacanaMike...thanks for the updates man. Stay safe
"not to get religious, but praying for something the so called god made...makes no sense.Why..if he made this...would you pray after?"
Wheww PCMike.... Hopefully it will stay on for you for awhile.... !Angie
The Thomson plane touched down at Aeropuerto las americas.Not sure if that's the Santo domingo airport or not.It was on route for Punta
"Ok...update time Miro lost his sign. Yes...it is true...it fell down! But given the fact that he just pounded a stake in the ground...not totally unexpected!I had a great afternoon at the Corner until the police shut us down. Oddly enough the Colmado (7-11) that survives of the sale of alcohol, remained open...because they sell eggs...I guess! LOLDrive home was almost totally down wind....no events...nothing out of place on the roads.Came home to no power, which came back on 15 minutes later.Rain has been moderate...no flooding in my 12 mile travels through some low areas.Winds have shifted northwest and not bad at all. Expect some intensifying, but not crazy winds.Cortecito looked...like Coretcito earlier this afternoon, although online sites showed 13 foot waves. I am happy to be hear giving you real time reports...general computer generated scenarios.At 3:40pm...all is good in Bavaro-Punta Cana. The better part of the storm is yet to come and provided I have power, I will report...real time...no embellishments.CheersPCMike"
FoxyI thought they were all cancelled too
My husband and I are supposed to be headed there on Saturday... I REALLY don't want to have to reschedule!!!! :(
nice thing about rum...you can drink it at whatever temperature!
Stay safe PC Mike and your loved ones!
Thanks again PcMike...!!
"Mike, for those of us scheduled to fly in on Friday, we are praying for you to be able to update us so we can make the decision to come down or not. I have been glued to the national weather service updates and this forum for days. Thank you so much for keeping us up to date on the conditions on the ground. Stay safe."
Stay safe PC Mike. Thanks for all the info thus far!

Thanks PCMike....praying for your safety and all of our friends in Punta Cana.
I should say...not computer generated models!
"Mike, thanks so much for telling it like it is. I hope the night goes without incident for you. I too offer to stand you a drink once this is all over. We arrive on 28th!"
yes...thanks god for 2 hurricanes in 2 weeks. Keep up the good work!
"Me too, I have to be there on 23rd with my wife but I would like to reschedule if possible. I do not know if Sunwing will allow us to change the date."
"Hope everyone in Punta cana stay safe I'm sure you all will be ok, can't wait to be in Punta cana in less than 4 weeks time.Edited: 2 years ago "
It is probably a repositioning dreamliner with a few Thomson officals on and will stay there till Friday then short hop to punta for return to Gatwick. Only a guess though as the TOM number did not recognize on Gatwick departures.
Thanks pc Mike much appreciated
"for the love of Go, PLEASE stop asking if your upcoming trip will be ok. NO ONE CAN TELL THE FUTURE. no one knows what the resorts will look like until AFTER Maria has come and gone. Also the news is pretty good at reporting stuff, do your research! If you are worried about a future trip you either cancel and move on with your life or start a new thread that revolves around that. This thread is about hurricane maria, and some are finding it very resourceful and simultaneously annoying to have to sort through a mi!lion questions asking about specific resorts when most of those questions have been answered!"
Amen Krista.Edited: 2 years ago 
@Krista BAmen!!!
I'll go with my fiancee in the first week of October.We will be at Paradisu.I hope everyone is safe today and that nothing happens not only with Punta Cana but with everyone on the route of the hurricane.
RetroMikey said: I am not going to Preach to you (well - you are) And Perhaps people should turn to him and see what an ugly world we live in. (VERY uplifting message preacher) Good grief.
@krista b I agree- I'm currently taking refuge in a hotel room in the grand palladium and am relying on this thread (with spotty wifi) to see what's going on beyond our 4 walls- so it's a bit irritating fishing through posts from people who want to know what the hotel is going to look like in a month's time!
Spoken like a Chicagoan. Love it.
Live webcam of Bavaro beach areahttps:/…
"@PCMike... I have been checking in on the Palladium web cam.. it is really looking nasty there for sure...And Maria is not there yet, and that area will be having weather like that (sometimes stronger) until tomorrow night??Holy Moly!!Angie"
Update from Dreams Palm Beach: it's been very windy for several hours now and we've had a lot of rain. The hotel has localised flooding to some buildings and common areas. He worst is to come overnight but all the guests are safe and sound and looking forward to tomorrow morning and better weather. I'm happy to answer any questions about Dreams PB (I've nothing else to do).Edited: 2 years ago 
RetroMikey. Praised God that people could enjoy their vacations in the coming weeks.Why don't you pray for the people on the Island now and the people who live there and try and make their life a little better when you visit by tipping well. This isn't a rich country and the people need help more than vacationers wondering if we will be able to make it to the beach. I was following this thread as well because I was coming but just reading. PC Mike is doing a good job but let him not answer the same questions over again. A man of patience indeed.
Power off again...but actually no unusual for here! Swaying palms on a webcam look disastrous...but that is what palms do in 25 mph winds.
Reg138 I am going to be there on Monday for my honeymoon. Should I be optimistic that everything will be back to normal by then?
"We are headed to Punta Cana Friday the 22nd and are scheduled to be there around 1:30 in the afternoon. So far the airlines and hotel are holding out and not cancelling flights or accommodations. From what information I can get online it looks like Maria has taken a little more of a northern drift and will barely clip Punta Cana with hurricane force winds, if that's any consolation. At this point I would rather book another trip but I don't get the impression that I have that option."
"They have been saying that Punta Cana will get 70-80 mph winds, heavy rain and possibly a storm surge.Edited: 2 years ago "
Thanks for the update Reg138
Religious posts now? Give me a break.Edited: 2 years ago 
"992 - I would be amazed if the hotel isn't back up and running fine tomorrow. So Monday will be no worries. Of course I'm not really the man to ask and I don't know the weather forecast, but these hotels are amazingly efficient. One thing I am sure of: you will have a fantastic honeymoon with a beautiful lady. Hope to see you at the preferred pool."
Can we assume that the Palladium web cams (one at the pool and one at the beach) are still LIVE? I know sometimes when they lose power they automatically loop the latest video... thx
"Who is ""they say""???"
996 - you were deleted but well said.
"Mark I got your point and i agree. Cromito, Mark was reacting to a post a few pages back that said he would not preach..but then did..and said pray for those coming that they will have a good vacation. I get his outrage. I am coming in 3 weeks for my bazillionth time to punta cana, and i could care less about my trip. I care about my friends and people we consider family there. Their safety and livelihoods is so much more important than a stupid vacation. I get it MARK. I support your rant"
We are also arriving October 3! What resort?
Reg138 - Thankyou so much for the Dreams PB update. Due to fly out there on Monday and really appreciate your post.
"Good news, latest forecast, maria is downgraded to category 2 and for the first time Punta Cana is out of the dreadful ""cone""."
I just left the paradisus heading to the capitol. We left Punta Cana Paradisus at about 3pm. There was already water filling up in the lobby. Winds were strong and no visibility. Everyone is going into a shelter at 5pm. It was scary. Last I heard it's a category 3 but winds were strong when we left and Maria has not even hit yet
Yes I just saw that on the NHC now a cat 2
"Friday,,,,who is ""they""?"
As of 0500 PM AST Wed Sep 20 (Advisory #19)Hurricane Maria: Category 2Data: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/
"My question exactly. For those Canadians who were up in arms because their Government didn't step in fast enough to extract their sorry butts I say to them "" now do you understand why it's so cheap to travel at that time? If you chose to travel to a sun destination that falls along "" hurricane alley"" June 1st to Nov 1st ( and all those in the travel industry know this) then why should we spend the tax payers money to come to your rescue?Edited: 2 years ago "
"1007 that is not entirely true. They are moving the people from the non reserve side (aka closest to the beach and waves) to the reserve side. And yes, there is a shelter set up, a separate kids play area set up and a medical area set up, but not everyone is being moved there.I just received a picnic basket in my room. There is a ton of visibilty, just sent some video back home. It is windy and there are some strong gusts and it is definitely raining with periods of intense rain. Please be careful about the verbage you use as many people are reading this and are concerned for either themselves or others they care about. There's no reason to panic until its time to panic."
Janine! Howay Pet! Come and say hello when you get here.
Hey? Thanks a lot for your Update. Where did you find the Information thats it is a cat 2 now? I simply can not find the gradings...
https://www.windy.com/…Winds are currently at 34 knots
"Waters in the lobby? I was within 500 yards of your resort and there was no flooding what so ever. I drove from Bavaro to the west of the airport with wipers on intermittent. Sure...there were some squalls and gusty winds, but you would get those in an everyday thunderstorm. I think perhaps you are embellishing this somewhat. BTW...my girls just went roller skating on the road...how bad could it be??? I should also note that our back door (facing north) is open all afternoon. I am about to go out to BBQ.CheersPCmike"
Always refer to NHC for latest stats:http://www.nhc.noaa.gov
"Back in our room we lost telephone/TV/wifi connection but not all blocks have. Coming back intermittently. We have rain coming in through doors but that's just the force and angle of the wind. Despite Excellence El Carmen keeping restaurants open from 5pm till 7pm for dinner I don't think we will head out. Packs of fruit, bread and cakes delivered to all rooms as the staff do everything they can to make things OK."
I am watching Hurricane Central on the weather channel. They have the latest updates from NOAA and are showing that the cone has shifted to the north of PC.
"Hello everyone and good to see PuntaCanaMike still rocking it up with live reports!So I went to Punta cana Paradisus on the 8th (a day AFTER Irma passed north of the DR) and honestly, what I have learned from this is that the media WILL LOVE TO HYPE UP the event to get more viewership and to be ""safe than sorry"". For people worrying about canceling your trip, I would just highly advise you to wait and see what kind of impact the hurricane has before you cancel.My trip itself, was absolutely awesome. Other than Friday being rainy, we had perfect sunny weather for a whole week. You really could not tell that a Cat 4/5 storm had passed just north of the DR. No signs of damage at all. I could tell that a lot of people were initially scared off from IRMA because our resort was empty. Made for a really relaxing vacation because we never had to wake up early to save beach chairs/cabanas and fight for dinner reservations! Now that being said, Hurricane Maria's path seems to take it more closer to DR than IRMA, which PCMike stated over and over (he wouldnt be surprised of some floodings/ expressed over and over to stay away from the beach areas/ etc) but really, no one knows what impact Maria will have on DR till AFTER the fact. ESPECIALLY if you have insurance, wait to see what kind of impact Maria has on DR before canceling or else, you might miss out on a really good vacation. If you already are in DR at the resorts, LISTEN TO YOUR RESORT STAFF's INSTRUCTIONS as they have more training and experience with Hurricane than you or I.As for airlines, I found that Southwest tends to cancel flights the fastest in these kinds of situations and Delta likes to fly as much as possible.Everyone stay safe!"
Have been keeping in contact with my sister and her family who are at the Royalton. They are getting dinner soon and food for tomorrow as they will be in lock down beginning at 7:00 tonight through tomorrow night. Winds are picking up somewhat. They feel safe. The Royalton has been very accommodating and keeping people up to date on what to do.
We are scheduled to be at Dreams La Romona Saturday. I can't tell you how helpful Punta Cana Mike has been during both hurricanes. Thank you so much- we hope everyone in the DR is safe over the next feed days. Looking forward to Mikes updates after the storm.
Your posts during Irma were more accurate then any weather station. Kudos to you !!!
So Maria is going to pass DR as a category 2 hurricane before gaining strength again what sort of damage does a category 2 hurricane cause.
We were at the Paradisus Palma real. Did not mean to scare anyone and my apologies if I did. We left the resort. And when we left the visibility was not very good. Winds and rain were strong. The hotel is working hard to keep everyone safe. I have never been in anything like that so I was scared. They were saying it was cat 4 but glad it's a cat 2 now. But what i did not like is they jacked up the prices for people that needed to stay becuase there flights were cancelled. Not cool and loved the resort until that happend. The hotel has plenty of room only 450 people staying and can hold up to 4000.
"Jane,it all depends on which part of the hurricane passes over. The eyewall will always be the most deadliest. That being said, even with a Cat2 hurricane, wind/rain and wave heights can be dangerous to careless people. Right now, Maria has a 30-40% chance of having wind speeds over 75MPH. Around 70% chance of having windspeeds up to 58MPH.Most resorts in Punta Cana is well prepared for that kind of a storm. Stay safe!"
"#1011, us Canadian are not very educated and do not know what ""hurricane alley"" is. Furthermore, not everyone can afford to travel in high season due to various reasons (vacation flexibility, budget etc...). Sad that our ""government"" had to rescue some folks since our ""government"" goes on private vacations at the tune on $250K of tax payer money.... Nice of you to be concerned about us Canadians."
"I'm not out there at the minute going in less than 4 weeks and it will be my first time in the Caribbean,So I'm at bit worried but still wanting to come,staying at the bahia principle resort in Punta cana can't wait."
"By Maria, I meant Punta cana** has ***Right now, Punta cana has a 30-40% chance of having wind speeds over 75MPH.Punta cana Around 70% chance of having windspeeds up to 58MPH."
"My son just messaged me and they have been moved from Now Onyx to Breathless. They have movies and beach chairs set up for sleeping and being served food/drinks, except alcohol obviously :)Edited: 2 years ago "
I do understand everyone is looking at different web site for hurricane path.. I just went on Windy and to me it looks like Maria is pulling away further out.away from DR.. could I be mistaken?Oh and PC MIke .. your updates are awesome!!!! (and now I want to BBQ )Angie
I'm coming out there on Sunday 24th as long as BA are flying from Gatwick I'll be there at the bar in breathless.Stay safe everyone out there let's hope it's not too serious.
"@angie g - I wouldn't rely on Windy.com to know what is happening now - it's not a live picture but the most recent forecast model, some predictions are only updated every few hours, the EU model every 12 hours. Best to keep an eye on written updates from the NHC - as well as satellite pictures, radar, etc - which seems to be available on a number of sites and weather apps."
"My answer to Susan. Not one government flight came to Punta Cana to remoe anyone. And if you care to read back a few pages...the most expensive way out of ANY country is a ""government"" airlift. Scheduled flights are the cheaest option...and yess...if the government pulls you out...YOU have to pay! Please...do your homework before you make such statements.CheersPCMike"
Arriving Saturday hopefully and staying at the Paradisus Palma please update the conditions there later. Stay safe!
"Just read this -The hurricane, now predicted to pass north of the Dominican Republic, was downgraded to a Category 2 storm after it passed over Puerto Rico.We are at Majestic Elegance. We have been moved to an upper floor and have some curfews in place. We are picking up boxed food after dinner and will stay in our room for the rest of the night. There are periods of heavy rain and wind, and a few palm trees are down. The power has flickered a handful of times."
"ok...out on a limb time!Maria will not adversely effect any resort. Sure there will be some minor clean up, but as I predicted a few days back, Maria is tracking far enough east to spare us any hurricane force winds or damages.Tonight the winds will blow...like fall in the northeast...and there will be some rain squalls....but...but my reputation on the line...we will be fine!CheersPuntaCanaMike"
YES!! Thank you so much for all your updates and reassurance Mike. I'll sleep better tonight knowing that my son is safe!
"PC Mike - mucho gracias!! All your time and effort on here is greatly appreciated. PS: I hope you're as optimistic about the Leafs playoff chances this season! Cheers,Mike"
"THANKS MIKE best news I heard in days. Feeling good about my decision to postpone from Tuesday to Friday and not cancel . I am starting to pack, cannot wait. I hope your ""Maria in review"" will be out before I head to the airport."
"#1039 Mike if you are right then I suspect it is about time someone in the World of weather came and offered you a top job! Trip Advisor is often criticised but you are a brilliant example of the good it can bring. Taking the time out of your own life to advise, help and reassure others is really appreciated."
"Thanks PC Mike I will sleep tonight for the 1st time in a couple of nights. Sorry about your Leafs, but then I'm from Ottawa Go Sens Go"
"we have no power again, but I think that Cepm simply shut down as there is yet to be enough wind to cause problems. Power is out at my friend's places too. Wind is on the increase right now, but unless you are in a shack, you are simply aware. I am thinking of some of my friends in the Hoyo, but they are a resilient bunch and seem to bounce right back. As one person said...when you have nothing...you have nothing to loose."
I am at Melia Caribe and they just made an announcement saying Hurricane Maria went from a category 5 to a category 2. We were told we get to go back to our rooms in a few hours. We have power here. We are all in a ballroom on 1 single mattresses per room.
Some people do not have the luxury of travel during a high season. Don't be so judgemental!
what hurricane ever crossed Puerto rico and came out strong? LOL
We made some great friends at the little flea market (actually the bar) on Bavaro beach next to the Iberostar resort. Irma absolutely smashed the flea market. They are now sending us video updates and we are also watching the live webcams at the Palladium hotel. Branches flying everywhere. I hope everyone remains safe and there's no damage like it was with Irma. They have just started rebuilding and I'm afraid they are getting hit again.
"Mike, like everyone here. Thanks for all your posts, its good information and its all coming to fruition. I'm currently in PC. What time scale prediction do you give this storm to pass over?"
Are there any working live cams within the punta cana coastline that are active??
The beach shacks are the most vulnerable places...and they know it...no need for pity. like building on a flood plain and wondering why every year your place washes away
"At the Palladium...although I haven't seen a lot of ""branches flying around"" since I've been watching this afternoon...https:/…Traveler"
"Yes... we use this one. Different views, some are down thoughhttps:/…"
Wrong... lots of room for pity. Those guys have to make a living as well... we have been there 4 times over the last year and communicate with them a lot! No pity?? That's pitiful
Tune in to CNN. They have reporters there in Punta Cana.
Thank you so much for all your support PC MIKE!! Muchisimas gracias!! May God Bless you in every possible way!
"Thanks, PC Mike for all of your information! We're not traveling for a few weeks and we're going to Santo Domingo instead of PC, but I have still read all 106+ pages over the past few days as I've been concerned about the general welfare of all of Hispanola. Your information and insights have been amazing (as has been your patience! I don't know how you do it)Stay safe!Cheers!Edited: 2 years ago "
I've just made an enquiry and it looks like the Dreams PB management are going to keep all their guests 'locked up' here in the theatre all night. Not happy as it's not much fun in here.
"If there were one PuntaCanaMike in every place facing a disaster, the world would be a better place..."
Reg128 My wife and I are due to arrive at Dreams Palm B friday 9/22 to celebrate her BD. Do you think they'll be taking guest this early after the storm? My flight hasn't cancelled yet and her BD is Saturday reason why I don't want to push this trip back a day of 2.
"Estamos no iberostar bavaro e por enquanto só ventando e chovendo! Mas um vento normal, nada demais, parece uma tempestade do Brasil....Estamos em nosso quarto normalmente, os funcionários trouxeram lanche com pão, leite, salada e frutas... Agora é esperar. Os coqueiros e demais árvores balançam bastante e caem folhas, mas só isso por enquanto. Energia elétrica, sinal de TV e de internet normais.Edited: 2 years ago "
Amen
1061: I can't tell you yet how much damage will be done by Maria - 1. Because it's to early to tell & 2. I'm holed up in the theatre with about 350 people! However the hurricane has been downgraded and its track takes it away from us. I take my guidance from PCMike and suggest that all will be well. I promise that I will update as soon as I get out of here and let you know how the hotel is. That however is not going to be for 12-15 hours. :(
Thanks so much!!!!!!
I see there are reports of planned strike action by Thomas Cook pilots on Saturday. If due to leave Punta Cana soon but don't yet have confirmation of when you might want to ask them what impact this might have on plans.
In breathless now which is next door to xnyx and a few minutes from dreams punta cana. WiFi is poor so won't be able to update arms we are restricted to lobby and lounge. The room were being kept in is like a fortress and we have had lots off food and drink. Real credit to the hotel. Atmosphere is more than relaxed and at this rate with the storm easing service should resume shortly and the people arriving will be lucky and happy. Obviously the worst is to come but anyone coming here rest assured they are more than ready to look after you.
Now experiencing power outages at Excellence El Carme but they seem to have generators as currently only off for a couple of minutes at a time. Guests were given choice of staying in rooms or heading into conference centre. We have opted for staying in room and it looks like a lot of others have too. Hope that was the right decision.
Mike- can you update us on hurricane Maria and the damage in Punta Cana?
At sanctuary cap cana. I would estimate winds 30-40 mph with some 50+ gusts. All guests are in rooms at building farthest from beach. Food and bar still open. Overall a very relaxed atmosphere. Staff has been fabulous. We had one power outage for 2-3 min.
"Update from where I am on Bavaro beach. Storm is growing in strength, heavy winds and raining. No flooding in our resort, just sitting water.All guests here are in their rooms, however ground floor has been moved to upper floors for risk of floods."
"Susan F that's uncalled for and quite snobby of you to say. I have the assets to travel whenever I want and wherever I want.... I've always preferred to visit the Caribbean in the fall. Yes, at my own risk.... and I never buy the insurance. Since your so much better off than the rest of us why are you even on this forum since you'd not date travel the same time of year as us meager travelers?"
We're currently in the Catalonia Hotel in PC (20:30 local time) the hotel has been absolutely amazing! We've got plenty of food & drinks & communication has been great. The storms really picking up now & there's lots of natural debris scattered all over! We've had very little communication from Thomson (TUI) in the form of a letter telling us to listen to instructions from the hotel!
Reg138. I really appreciate your response and any updates. Hope you have an easy night. Stay safe! Thank you!
"At Iberostar Bravaro Suites Punta Cana. All in our rooms and moved us into further back rooms. Right now Winds are howling through our windows and rain is sheeting past, but as expected and nothing really ""scary"" because this is exactly what we were expecting. There are branches and palm leaves down also as you would expect with the gusty winds. Next 4 hours or so should be the strongest winds according to Weather.us tracker. Box lunches for dinner and think I'm glad I'm getting to stay in my room. Stay safe all! And those thinking of coming soon....they are wonderful resilient people here and this is their livelihood, so hoping you come visit. They will get things back and going in no time. First time here, and a bummer I can't leave tomorrow as planned, but it is hurricane season you know!"
"Saleman # 912..,""no damage was done on the Caribbean coast nor on other north coast areas like Havana/Varadero."" That's total BS on your part.There was plenty of damage done in both of those areas. SMH"
"Hey Mike and everyone else, Thanks so much for the updates! I hope everyone stayed safe as the storm passed, the radar maps are showing Maria has passed the DR now, yes? Any updates on damage, let’s hope there isnt reallytoo much, would be much appreciated! My fiancé and I will be staying at the Paradisus Palma Real when we go in 2 weeks for our honeymoon!"
"No, it has not passed. There are very strong winds and rain happening right now."
Emily.... Maria is there now... has not passed the DR as of yet... Should maybe be updates by maybe end of tomorrow about damages....Angie
Here at Excellence El Carmen. In our room since 8pm. Winds howling about 80mph and raining. Waiting for instructions about tomorrow
We are at Majestic Mirage now. Winds are intense with gusts around 80-85mph. Heavy rain as well. We have been sequestered in our rooms for the last 30 minutes. Power went out for about 5 minutes but is now back on with no problems since. I'm fully confident in the staff's ability to keep us safe. We'll see what tomorrow brings.
Hurricane Maria has left Puerto Rico devastated. The entire island is without electricity. The storm is moving toward PC now so it is obviously impossible to know what will happen. Check back Friday.While I understand vacation concerns I am more concerned with the conditions for the people who live there as well as the safety of people who have been staying and working at the resorts. Please don't ask resort specific questions as they can't be answered.http://www.nhc.noaa.govhttp://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at5+shtml/235427.shtml?cone#contents
Good blow right now...battery low on the phone...all is good....keep it simple....cheers pcmike
"I'm also at Majestic Mirage. We are in our room. We had dinner at the buffet and brought back a box lunch that was provided by Majestic. The staff has done a great job with working to keep everyone safe and informed. They have a TV channel that they are using to provide updates and safety instructions. They moved all of the patio furniture into the rooms and made other preparations. Right now there are wind gusts and rain. It comes and goes. A branch from a palm tree ended up on our patio but that wasn't bad. I admit that I have been very nervous watching CNN's coverage of Dominica and Puerto Rico. However, I'm feeling OK now. I hope that everyone is safe."
Hope everyone stays safe. Thanks PCMIKE for keeping us updated. Keeping you in my prayers. Wish everyone can rest throught the night.
Looks like a palapa is a casualty on the beach at the Palladium...https:/…Traveler
"Looking at the Palladium webcam, two palapas have broken off and are laying upside down. Wow... getting some serious wind"
Ark_trav. Just posted the same thing.. thought I saw 2. But it's just one
Stay safe mike and thank you for all of your updates.Edited: 2 years ago 
"I totally agree with you; PC Mike is awesome! I'm traveling to PC at the end of October and I think I need to buy that man a drink, lol!"
Thank you to all the current PC travelers and especially PCMike for the live feed. My friends and I will be flying to PC from Toronto this Sunday Sep 24 - special girls trip :) Hopefully weather will be back to normal by then. Sending positive vibes to everyone in PC now and please stay safe!! *Big Hugsss*Edited: 2 years ago 
"To all who live there, I hope that you and your families stay safe and have minimum damage to contend with. After reading these threads both with Irma & now with Maria, P.C. Mike, you have provided so much helpful information to so many. Seeing all of the drink offers (which you greatly deserve!), you might not have to buy your own for quite awhile! Stay safe tonight."
"Yes, Susan, I agree with everyone who says you are rude and uninformed. By the way, Hurricane season is June 1st until November 31st, not November 1st. Check your facts.....Google is good for that in case you didn't know...."
"EXACTLY what Mr. Annon from SC said . . . my heart goes out to the residents of Hispanola for whom this island is home and for whom Maria will (possibly) leave her mark for weeks and months to come.For those of you riding out the storm, whether locals like Mike, or tourists who are going to have one heck of a story to tell . . . . stay safe and keep us updated!"
Definitely looks like there's a second palapa down at the Palladium.https:/…Traveler
I traveled with my late husband several times in September and we would celebrate our anniversary in Mexico. We obviously got married in hurricane season on Cape Cod which has hurricanes. Life is full of risks and unless you take them you may as well live in a bubble.
"yeah, now it does look like there's a second one down and wind seens stronger"
Cathy I was supposed to fly in today to the Iberostar Bavaro Suites they postponed until Monday do you think the resort is going to be up and running and back to normal by Monday
Cortney no one can predict this. Check on Friday.
No idea Courtney. We are in the middle of it now. Should know more Friday. We were to fly out tomorrow and can't get out til Saturday. They should know more by Friday. Be glad you aren't here now during it. Prayers for all here whose homes aren't as well built as these hotels are. Many of them are likely the employees who help us.
Agree cc Mike is awesome prayers for all of you there as home or as travellers -we hope all is intact for us to join you Sunday . Be well stay safe and have faith
"My husband and I are going to bahia principe blue ambar punta cana November 25, 2017. Are there any updates on how the resorts have survived? Thinking of all those people that were their to witness very scary."
"From the Be Live Canoa in Bayahibe, everything is fine as of now. Light winds, light rain, no damage or flooding. We are on the south coast so everything is very mild here. Power has blinked a few times, gone out once for 10 minutes."
I agree September is a great time to travel but worth the risk of being hurricane season. I was here around same time last year and it was perfect this year we just caught the end of Irma and now we are in the middle of Hurricane Maria.We will be here 2 weeks unless our flight is cancelled longer. Mother nature at its best
Been to the Caribbean over 25 times and every time during Hurricane season. And am booked to stay at Now Onyx for 14 days from October 31st. And will continue to do so in the future.I'm not being blasé about the potential dangers of hurricanes.. But we think it's a small risk that is worth taking for the pleasure that these trips bring us.Would also like to thank everyone inc PCMike for the updates during this time. It helps give some perspective at a time when it would be easy to press the panic button.Above all stay safe to you all.
How has LIfestyles Resort in Punta Cana faired?? I get conflicting reports?
"We are coming to PC on 10/14, hope all will be in order by then, I guess PC Mike is the best meteorologist for all of us. I thing he even goes to check individual resorts for people. Good bless!!! He is a great volunteer who enjoys helping people!!! I think he lives there and knows the island's mentality. I can put up with some inconveniences when I arrive as long as nothing bad happens to anyone."
"@sologirl50 reply 1094thanks, you made me laugh :) november 31st ? are you sure? Loolcit: "" Check your facts.....Google is good for that in case you didn't know....""loolThanks Mike for updates. really appreciated. I'm on the list of people who will offer you a good drink, maybe a good rum :)Edited: 2 years ago "
Maria back up to a cat 3 on NHC
Thanks for the update from Sanctuary. Scheduled to arrive there Monday afternoon. Would love an update tomorrow when the storm passes. Stay safe.
"Following this very closely and Mikes updates really reassure us. What an ambassador for your country, it's so refreshing to read and when family are saying we shouldn't even contemplate it, I know we will be coming regardless. 14 days and counting!"
Thanks for the update from Sanctuary. Scheduled to arrive Monday. Would love a report in the morning. Stay safe.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Hello dear everybody, We are booked in La Romana in a couple of weeks. How is that place doing? We will be landing in PC airport. Hope things will be well by then.God bless all!"
"Hi,where did you book this trip with Thompson? was it from Poland? as the Thompson first choice in England have told me to sit tight. we are going to dreams palm beach in punta cana.Thanks"
"@cubabride2015, I was staying at Bahia Principe Punta Cana this week and got lucky enough to get a flight out Tuesday right before they closed the airport. Several of my friends stayed. The hotel didn't give any updates or warnings about the hurricane. I got them by looking online as well as friends and family calling me worried. A friend who is still there said the hotel moved them to another room, boarded up the sliding glass doors, confined them to their rooms and left them several sandwiches as well as a lot of chips and other packaged food. She hasn't been able to look outside but said it sounds pretty wild out there. The Bahia Principe resort is huge with several different named ones together (Bavaro, Punta Cana, Luxury, and others) so you might be in the same area. I would like to go back to the Dominican Republic but I will pick out a different resort next time."
"Hello everyone:) We are flying tomoorow from Paris to Breathless in Uvero Alto. I've seen on National Hurricane Center that Maria is near the north coast of DR so i am dying for update- how everything looks after the night. I've been following this disscusion since the very first post so i am avare that Maria could do some damage ( like flooding - esspecialy in my destinaton area ). PC MIKE - i guess you still sleeping ( here in Poland is already 9AM ) so after you woke up and drink the morning coffe, please give us some informaton- i preffered the good one :)"
"My husband and I are here now. It seems much quiter out than it was 4 hours ago. Still gusts of wind and rain. From our room windows it looks like pools that were drained some earlier are overflowing. We have some debris on our balcony and water is leaking into our second floor room. It seems like the worst has passed us, but when the sun rises we will know the extent of the impact."
"Ill also add that we never lost power throughout the night, which we are very thankful for."
"Ashlyn M- are you in Breathless? Or in different resort? In which part of DR? This is a good news that you are safe, still have a power and the worst has passed you :) As you said, you will see more in the morning."
"We are at Majestic Elegance, which is about 12 miles from Breathless"
"Me and my husband are about to come on 28th. This is our first time in DR. We are going to stay at Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort, Spa & Casino. Hope that everything will be fine! Stay safe!"
Just back online as we lost phone line and wifi for several hours. Continue to sit it out in our room in Exvellence. Still lashimg down with rain and the wind is howling but seems bit calmer than it has been most of the night. Because of the phone line issue we lost contact with the hotel. Water kept coming into 1st floor room though towels did a good job keeping a lot more out. Room has a really pungent damp smell which will linger for a long time.Too dark to see how the resort has faired. We are right at the back and there was concern about storm surges nearer the front but I've no way of knowing right now what has happened.I am thinking and hoping the worst is behind us and I just hope everybody has managed to stay safe.
Still in breathless being well looked after. Breakfast is just going up its 5am power still on and minimal wind damage from the lobby area. A small hole has been made in the roof to help water drain but it really all seems quite and calm (we are in a nice secure building) will post once I can see the resort but I'm sure these guys will have her back to normal within a couple of days.
Thoughts are with everybody out there at the moment. We are due to travel to the Hard Rock in 3 weeks does anybody know if it has any damage? Many thanks
"@Sleep007 Great to hear that you are in good shape and the storm is almost over. I hope, after you will be allowed to leave the room you don't see a big damage. I must say that worries me the water coming into your room. The same thing is on the second floor too. My bigest concern are this storme surges near the front. Stay safe and thank you for the update :)"
I am set to arrive Saturday around 2 PM. Does anyone have any info on IFA Villas Bavarro? I haven't seen anyone post unless I missed it
Good morning everybody. Hope Mike and the gang down there all did well last night. Hows it hanging down there?
@Summers45 Thank you so much for the update about the Breathless :) Mayby we will see each other at the dinner toomorow ;) I have a feeling that everything will be fine- it must be since we going no matter what- unless our flight will be cancelled which i doubt. We just can't wait to be again in the paradise:) I am waiting now for your post after you be back to your room and see the resort area.
"Hello everyone. I was reading this forum From fen days. Me and my bf arrived to PC yesterday about 8 pm and it was really scary. We landed in Santo Domingo becouse of Maria and arrived by bus. About 3-4 hours ago was really unkind. In our resort Catalonia Punta Cana a lot of trees arę on the ground, but staff care about our safety. Now the wind is not so strong, but we heard it will be worse in few hours. Hope everybody is fine:)"
I follow this topic from begin. We suppose to arrive on Monday 25 sept. The tourperator Tui doenst communicate and has no updates. Should we cancel or change our destination? Because we are worried about the resort and the weather coming. We are going to RIU PALACE BAVARO. Can anybody tell me how is it going there? Thanks
"Hi,@OlgaShcheglova I'm due to fly out to DR with TUI at the beginning of October and haven't heard anything, i'm assuming no news is good news :)Edited: 2 years ago "
"Marta K- i just checked Maria's current position and it looks like she is in Punta Cana at the moment so i doesn't supposed be worse then now. I really hope that the worst is behind you. Anyway, i am not an expert- have a little experience in tracking hurricane path :) We are still waiting for the real expert -PC MIKE :) Stay safe - it can only be better from now on. Don't think otherwise :)"
Mike usually gives us his 1st update about 6AM...I will worry if we don't hear from him by 7...He did say he was low of battery power for his phone and he did say his power was off. I'm hoping it has come back but I have no idea. Fingers crossed he and everybody else are ok.
"@OlgaShcheglovaHi, We are also supposed to arrive on 25th at Riu Hotel. We do not have updated news from our travel agency either. On the hotel's site there are no updates either.If you find out anything, can you please share with us?Thank you,DianaEdited: 2 years ago "
Hello everyone. Hope everyone that is down in Punta Cana is safe. I am arriving 9/27 and staying at the Hard Rock. Does anyone know how that resort is doing. Not much reported on this location. Any information would be appreciated. Thanks PC Mike for the excellent coverage.
Your welcome Paula :) I'll be sure to post once I can have a walk round the hotels.
Just spoke to my son who is staying at Bahia principe punta cana ..... says some water through the roof apart from that is fine but still dark so will know more later ....
"Ok, so all we can do is wait... I am sure he is ok and we see him here in one hour."
Thank you Cathy my prayers are with everybody down there if you could keep us updated on the Resort that would be great
"Hi All,I was due to fly out on Sunday 24th on the BA flight but ba haven’t updated me yet instead they will provide an update on Friday to let us know if the flight was still scheduled. I didn’t want to wait around so they gave us the option to fly to another ba destination within the Caribbean we decided to go to JamaicaHope everyone travelling to punta cana doesn’t have any problems "
"For everyone wondering if they're going to make it down...think about if you're in the middle of the same situation: Would you respond to people in the middle of the storm how the resort fared, or wait until the storm is over?Use your heads...wait for the storm has moved out. I'm sure you'll see plenty of reports on here and your resort's Facebook page. And from recent history from Irma - your travel agent probably knows very little if anything. It's going to be best to do your own research, primarily using these two avenues."
How is that resort? We are suppose to travel there at end of November? Was it as nice as all the pictures?
"Hi , I'm currently in the Catalonia royal bavaro and we have had a pretty rough night , yes was scary But I'm in once piece ( touch wood) the storm seems to be passing as not as loud and the howling as stopped . Still very window and a few noises but compared to around the 8pm to 3am mark it pretty , all I can see so far is my balcony is flooded , felt from roof off , some parts of wooden roofs off. Will update more when we can go out . We are still on lockdown till we get a knock on door ."
I'm going to the agency this evening to ask what are the options. Be looked a long time to visit PC. In Belgium is always rain so we need the SUN. If I see the weather forecasts it's everyday raining in PC from now.

The weather is still raging here and it is still dark as it's only 6.25hrs. No one can report on damage to any resort as we are still holed up in our rooms so there is no point asking at this stage.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Good morning...power off and computer battery low, it was a good blow last night and i imagine there is a tree or two down. Some damages to poorer structures.....I will see later when i go for a drive, Personally, I suffered no damages that i can see now that it is light again. Very little rain,,,,wind now out of the south and dying fast....still a breeze though.All is good for me,,,we will see about others later today.CheersPCMikeEdited: 2 years ago "
Glad to hear your good Mike.
"I know everyone will want to know as much as possible, but that will take time. Maria did what i thought she would. Shook the windows and made me wonder when I was going to loose the roof over the terrace....did not even loose a shingle...nice try Maria!!! LOLSo, be patient and info will arrive in timely manner.CheersPCMike"
"PC Mike- great to see you here. We were excepting you around 6- 7AM :) Glad there is all good for you and no damage done. Sure, there is more to see later so we all patiently waiting. For now- this is a great news that wind is dying- looks like Maria is moving away. Hope for more good news :)"
Quick look outside from balcony now light is coming through. Located at back of Excellence El Carmen. Some small trees down and various snapped branches. A small door blown off an external bar which had not been secured properly. No building damage this far back. Will head out later.
"Glad to hear to hear your place is still whole and you didn't lose the roof! I'm assuming (correct me if I'm wrong) that the wind has died down. My question now is, what are you expecting for rain?"
"I did last year, and we only got rain! This does not happen every year..., it hasn't happened in years!"
It always says that in the forecast but is not usually the case. We always see the same thing before we go to Punta Cana and then have wonderful weather.
"Palladium webcam is back up. Damage at the beach looks to be what it was last night, at least from the camera. It could have been a lot worse...https:/…Traveler"
"@Olga, this is the tropics. You will likely get one shower daily, probably short and after sunset. If during the day you should be back in the sun in minutes. Occasional weather phenomena can occur though, like Maria right now, but they are the exception. The rain you are seeing in the forecast is not related to the hurricane"
"Does anyone have any news on how Samana is fairing up, particularly Cayo levantado. I'm due to fly out there on Saturday arriving in the evening, and can't find any news on how Maria in this area?"
"I agree with Danmaxx and Kathy D. I remember our first trip to Punta Cana- in the forecast rain every day and no sun. And nth like that happend :) Every year, in September we have a lovely weather."
"Just had a peak outside at breathless resort. Looks to be superficial damage, few plastic roofs off and some puddles."
"From Ocean Blue and Sand, things have died down. Still gusty but nothing major.Palm trees have lost a few branches and all the sunbeds are now in the pool, but overall, all good!"
"PC Mike- Thanks for the update. We will be waiting for more info from you :) It seems that you are ok, right? That is great! I hope that is the same for the rest of the cities in DR!PaulaMikulska - I'm also optimistic! I'm arriving tomorrow afternoon to stay for a week on the Catalonia Royal Bavaro. I hope the weather gets better soon and everything is ok with the people in Punta Cana and with the hotel, airport and everything. I don't want to cancel, but I'm still not sure. Let's wait and see :)"
Cheers for the update PC Mike. We are on our way to Manchester airport as a type. Glad you are safe and without damage. See you soon
Any news on the hotel catolinia Bavaria and the weather in punta canaMy nephew is staying at this hotel
"Jacquline I'm at the Catalonia royal bavaro right next door , we are currently still on lockdown so can't give you much of a damage report . From what I can see from my balcony which looks onto your sons hotel there felt of the roofs , palm trees snapped , wooden canopy ripped of and On the pathway. , slight flooding . Still windy. Will update more when we can go out . Luckily our power and wifi stayed on which I was very shocked at ."
Hi all I'm at the grand palladium and have slept through most of the hurracane Just looked out onto the balcony there are lots of palm tree leaves and a few tiles of the roof I can see the beach from my room and the sea looks very rough. The room floor has flooded but the electric is still on .Hope everyone stayed safe last night .the staff here have been amazing the hurricane has eazed off now so think things should be back to normal quite soon

I'm looking for an update from someone who's staying at Secret Cap Cana. We will be arriving Saturday afternoon. Thanks
"We went in April, and 1st week of November last year, and April and July this year. Summer and April were incredible. When we arrived in November, was a monsoon upon arrival. Rained every day but we also got some sun. It's the rainy season in PC but we took our chances. Have to say, I don't like dodging rain. We have our next trips already planned, but they won't be in November. We used to cruise every October, the ships could out maneuver bad weather but sitting on an island, you can't. It is what it is during the rainy months.. we love PCEdited: 2 years ago "
@wahoowa12 I went last year 10/28-11/5 it poured most evenings very late. Often when we'd be looking to return for evening like 12-2am. With exception to 1 day for maybe an hour we experienced no rain during day/evening hours. This span I and many others never even left the pool area. Don't trust the forecasts either because they'll suggest high chance of rain daily. My experience was mostly sunshine and happiness. Perhaps I just got lucky.
"Was wondering how the rui bamboo is faring??, we are due to arrive Wednesday the 25th. It will be out first time to punta Cana!"
"@Dan R Can you tell me if Frankie is still a bartender at Ocean Blue? Small little guy with a huge personality, one of the best!"
Anyone have a update that's staying at Secrets Royal Beach? Much appreciated.
Hi we are supposed to fly to Secrets Cap Cana on wed oct 4 for our my wif'es birthday...Does anyone know how much damage is expected?
"Great point Jmuelly. We spent 10 days at the end of July beginning of August this year. We looked at the weather forecasts and laughed as they called for rain every day. It rained for 10 minutes 1 dayout of 10. Was hot as hell but perfectly sunny the entire time (minus the 10 minutes). But.. having said that, as I stated, we saw the weather first hand in November. No tropical systems, just rainy...we were there from Nov 5-12 so we just missed you :-) and unfortunately our rain was during the day. We had to huddle under umbrellas a lot. Was cozy thoughEdited: 2 years ago "
"Yikes, guess I did get lucky. I'm headed back to PC late Jan 2018. Hopeful to get nice weather again."
"We're also on that same flight, we're holding out for some good news on Friday, we hope, enjoy Jamaica."
"I can give an update from Dreams Palm Beach. We are all still locked up in the theatre and an announcement has just been made that we will be here for another 4 hours at least. They have opened a door (for the smokers) and it is only breezy now with some higher gusts. There has been a lot of rain though and I think the hotel want to make areas safe prior to letting us out. If I were flying tomorrow and had an option to put it back a couple of days, I would. It's just that I think it's going to take a few days to get things straightened out."
Latest update: Maria now 95 miles from PC. TS winds still extend approx. 150 miles so will be windy for a bit still.
Reg138 Thank you for the update! Ive been looking for you and Mike this morning. I'm glad to hear you guys made it though but I'm sorry youre still stuck in there. Is it still raining and if so how much more are they expecting? Flooding was one of the big concerns for that area when I asked the other day
"Thank you Clair for the update, please keep me posted we are worried Thank care x"
"I'm still in the room at Majestic Mirage watching TV and drinking coffee. The power and internet are still on. We only loss power for a few minutes yesterday. It's a little windy at this time but not too bad. There's some debris on the patio but nothing major. No water leaks in my room but I'm not sure about the others. I don't know about damage to the rest of the resort or beach area because we're still on lockdown. My room is not located near the beach so I have no idea what it's like at this time. The resort provided muffins, croissants, fruit, and juice in the room so I'll have that for breakfast if the restaurants don't open. We'll stay hunkered down in the room until the resort gives the ""all clear"" to leave."
"Melissa, Wednesday or the 25th, whichever, it should be fine by then."
"#1120 Ashlyn! So thankful you are ok! We are supposed to be flying inn saturday afternoon and staying at Magestic Elegance. We got full trip insurance and have the option to reschedule or postpone and the way it sounds, we are hopeful we don't have to. I'm hoping you would be so kind as to update me with the conditions of the ME as you venture out and see what damage they've suffered. Thanks to you and everyone for keeping us all informed, I'm very grateful it seems everyone is unharmed."
"@summers45 This is what i was hoping you will see - superficial damage. Nth that can't be fix in the couple of days, right? Are you already in your room? @Fernando G I am always optimistic :) And i am sure the weather would be great- no other option!"
Just wondering about Melia. Scheduled to arrive on Saturday. Hoping all is well!

Re-posting Palladium webcamhttps:/…
1182: the rain is on/off light drizzle now and I think it is expected to last all day. PCMike would be better advising on that. When we left the hotel 16 hours ago there was definitely a problem with lying water. We are in building 4 which is close to the beach and we had to wade through an inch of water then. All the high end hotels are very smoothly run operations and know how to deal with this type of problem. I'm sure all will be back to normal in a couple of days.
"Minimal damage. Still windy, but aside from some leaves torn from trees and some thatch roofs that have a little damage, I see very little overall damage. We should be back to almost 100% tomorrow."
Took a drive to the airport...some trees and signs down. Airport looked fine. Still a good breeze but not enough to keep the girls inside...out playing in the yard...more later...concerve battery.CheersPCMike
"Taking a look at the cameras of Palladium, it looks like the worst has passed!! Hope everybody is OK!"
Flying out Monday 9/25. Does anyone have information on the damage to Barcelo Bavaro Palace?
Wow good to hear PCMike.. :)And also I am surprised there are already people walking the beach at the grand Palladium (via web Cam).. not many I think just guests taking pictures....Angie
"PCMike, you are a legend! I have been watching this thread avidly as we arrive on Monday 25th in the Bahia Amber Blue and my parents are currently already there - howling winds and a leaky roof but no more than that it seems. You should be paid for your updates, you have probably given peace of mind to a lot of people and for that I doff my cap in your direction. Thanks"
"Its 7:30 in the morning, I'm sure everything will be reported later in the day. Be patient. Many are still in lock down."
Just visit the agency Tui of there any option to change the destination or dates. They don't give us a chanse to do that. So we are coming Monday to PC. I hope everything will be fine by then.We are staying at Riu Palace Bavaro. Is any body there at the moment?
People walking on the beach at Palladium webcam
"I know that it is early yet, but does anyone know if there was damage to The Dreams Palm Beach resort?Glad to hear everyone is safe."
"Folks out on the beach, assessing damage, at the Palladium.https:/…Traveler"
We were booked on St Thomas for this week. Obviously that didn't happen. Rebooked last tuesday for Punta Cana Paradisus Palma Real for 10/21. And then here comes Maria! Beginning to wonder if I'm the jinx! Any info on Paradisus Palma Real would be most appreciated!
1201: check back on my previous posts.
Secrets Royal Beach Update. Just looked out on the balcony and there are some broken palm leaves. There are plastic roofs for some of the pool shelter off. They have started cleaning up the grounds. From 10 pm until 4 am it was crazy windy. The sky is starting to break.
Arriving to Riu Bambu tomorrow..Would appreciate any update on how the things are going down there. P.s. hope everyone is safe!
"Thank you so much for the updates! You are the best! I'm assuming that there is power in the city and on the hotels, right?"
Excellence El Carmen posted notes under doors to say they plan to open a few restaurants for brunch from 9am today and indoor bars too. They even expect to have the evening show at 9.30pm. Great efforts and optimism. We didn't get the note as we blocked the door with towels to stop the flow of water LOL
What is the word from Now Onyx and Breathless? Last post I saw they were still in the convention center and safe. Is everything in pretty good shape?
thank you Mike ;) arriving the 26th Majestic Elegance
"Hello, we will arrive at breathless Resort On Sunday. Is Everything ok at the Resort. Are you Save? Should we Go? Looking forward to your answer to Flora@eurodancers.ch. Best geeetingd from switzerland Flora"
Any news on the Nickelodeon Resort. I am still over a week out but nervous...
Any information on the Barcelo Bavaro beach resort. Heading there this Saturday
Thanks for the update!
We arrive at the Iberostar Grand Hotel Bavaro next Saturday would love a update on that resort as well. Hope everyone is safe!
Thanks for the update on excellence. How's the damage over there? We're heading there in two weeks? Are you happy with the resort in general?
Thanks for the update!!
"Anyone staying at the Paradisus, how is everything there?"
"I know its still kind of early, but has anyone heard anything about Bavaro Princess Resort, Spa & Casino? Power/ Water? Didn't look like anyone was staying there that was on this thread, so I thought I would ask :)"
"I am just in awe how some people are quickly asking how much damage was done to the island.People, give it a couple of days, there's RISK assessment needed to take place. Let's all ask if there were any casualties, or if you are planning to travel here, what can we bring to the DR people who suffered or their needs?People just too concerned if there will be sun, food and booze. Unreal.PC Mike, hope you and your family are well, I prayed for you and others buddy on the island. :)Edited: 2 years ago "
Anything from Hard Rock Hotel? Thanks!
"Hello allIt is so good to read that all of you are in good shape and condition - even if still closed at rooms or conference room, etc. Have a pice of advice for all those, who are coming to their resorts soon and want to know in what condition is exact place/hotel/resort. Use Instagram for example, search for your hotel and there you will already find some photos made by quests.You will have some overview about the situation. based on them.I also think, that when you ask politely quests who are there now will describe the situation in private message too :-) Best regards for all Punta Cana people, hope for very minimum damages and for the sun to come back soon :-DEdited: 2 years ago "
Hey RegI don't think we have the option. Arriving tomorrow whether we like it or not lol. Get the kettle on and I'll bring my wellies and be prepared to get stuck in. See you soon
Please let me know how things are going. I'm scheduled to flight out to your resort tomorrow. Thanks!Cathy
"I can't say about damage at Secrets Cap Cana yet as we have been evacuated to Santo Domingo until tomorrow, but what I can say is the staff at Secret Cap Cana have been amazing and the resort was well packed up and secured before all guests were moved to high standard accommodation in Santo Domingo I would have no concerns over coming to Secrets in the coming weeks I am certain they will have everything sorted and they will sure look after you! I will update again once we have got back there tomorrow :-)"
@Flora M @krboyle There was an update about Breathless from @summers45 - in the resort at the moment.To a first look no bigger damage. We need to be patient for more updates but i am really optimistic. The most important is they are safe and survive through the night.We are flying toomorow so i'll be able to give some information too. Now Onyx is next to Breathless so i don't think there will be different situation there. There was also an update from PC MIKE about Punta Cana Airport- no bigger damage.
"@ Retro MikeyIt's bad what happened to the island and the people that live there. But I can understand that people are concerned about their vacation. They have been working really hard the whole year, they saved money to have only 1 week of the deserved vacation. So they just want to have everything that they paid for. It's expensive to travel from Europe to this region and people doesn't have a good weather in Europe, so they hope to have some sun during their vacation.Last time I visit PC I brought some clothes, candy's and stuff to the people of the island. So I will do that again."
Now Onyx has suffered significant damage. See video on facebook.https:/…
First sentence of everyone's post should be to thank PCMike and everyone else who is in Punta Cana right now and providing all of us with with first hand updates. I do have a question about storm surge. The 8am update from the NHC site warns of a 4-6 foot storm surge along the northern coast. Has there been any reports at to what the storm surge has actually been? Thanks and Please stay safe everyone.
I am glade you are safe would love an update as I am heading to that resort next Wednesday
Any word on the Melia Caribe?
I am scheduled to arrive on the 24th at the Hard Rock. Has anyone heard anything?
Hi EveryoneJust wondering if anyone has any news on the Iberostar Punta Cana. We are due out next Thursday. Would be grateful for any information please. Thanks Mike for your updates.Yvonne xx
"@RetroMike - I understand your general concern that storms do affect locals, but TripAdvisor is first and foremost a travel site, and if people want to be charitable or express concern and sympathy, I am sure they are already doing it through other means - especially for people of islands actually touched by the hurricanes, such as Dominica, St Martin or Puerto Rico, etc.On the other hand, I agree - people asking really specific questions about hotels or about holidays in 2 or 3 weeks time, may be premature!"
"I have already said this in an earlier post but it's worth repeating:We did an excursion on Tuesday with PCMike's tour company. It really was a great day. Check it out on Trip Advisor. The ratings are very high indeed. ""Punta Cana Mike's Private Dominican Adventure""(I am not related to Mike and am getting no reward for posting this. We just had a great day out)"
"I’m due in on Monday to now larimar, anyone any updates on that resort with regards to damage etc? Looks like the storm is passing on the live web cams so hopefully things will get back to normal quite soon Many thanks"
Janine: looking forward to having some North East glamour and wit in the hotel. Have you upgraded?
I was supposed to fly to Punta Cana Last Tuesday Sep 19th and I was staying in Secrets Royal Beach Punta Cana for 5 days. I did severalcalll to their call center since Sunday and nobody could really tell me what to do. The Hurricane cone was already in place so finally on Monday late evening after 10 different calls to the 1 (866) number I could change my flight to travel the 27th. American Airlines dont charge you extra fees if you are in the list of possible cities that could be affected by Maria. The hotel charged us 1 night for the change but when I talked to the reservations department in Punta Cana Hotel they told me they were not charging cancellation fees because the NHC determined Dominican Republic was under hurricane watch. So my next step is going to be claim my money back. I sent a lot of e-mail but nobody solved this issue yet. Let the storm pass to create another storm... Good luck everyone travelling to Punta Cana.
I did not know it's hurricane season when I booked. Lesson learned! I'll never book a trip to carribean in the fall! We have a trip planned October 21st to Punta Cana. I bought insurance. I may change my trip.
"It looks like a closed group, what is significant damage?"
"No news on nickelodeon/Sensatori as we have been evacuated until today/tomorrow. One thing I will say though, before the hurricane many had a lot of negatives to say about Thomson but since being evacuated they have been amazing and the hotel we have all been moved to is also of a good standard. Without asking they are issuing us with two day refund maybe 3 dependant on when we return. Well done Thomson!! I can't say I was expecting much at all as I understand it was out of their control."
"My gf whom lives there said all of Punta Cana is without electricity (I imagine Hotels have back up) that they cut it for prevention and only way they can charge their phones is in their cars, trees and signs down (like Mike already said) and some flooding in houses from the drains overflowing. She said the wind is much calmer but the rain is still going.It is the people that live there I feel sorry for not the ones on here worried about upcoming Vacations."
Anybody know what is the situation of the Melia Caribe tropical Punta Cana after the huracan Maria?
"Reid T, Sorry you are correct it is a closed group, I forgot. The video is of a resort employee standing on a stage giving a status update. He mentions damage to the the roof, trees down, water collecting, and checking each individual room. It is hard to hear but they are keeping people in the convention center until further notice for their own protection. Everyone is welcome to join the group, just ask."
"Hoping that everyone is safe. Many thanks to everyone including the main man PCMike for updates.I'm getting conflicting stories regarding the Now Onyx, last entry was that it has significant damage any update as to the damage would be greatly appreciated."
"Estamos no iberostar bavaro e aqui está tudo bem! A estrutura do hotel está normal, porém tem árvores caídas, muitas folhas, cocos no chão, sujeira em geral mas os funcionários estão trabalhando muito para arrumar tudo. Parece que ficou mais prejudicado que com o Irma. O buffet de café da manhã já está funcionando normalmenteAcho que amanhã estará tudo em ordem"
"Ah e aqui tem energia elétrica mas acho que de gerador, e não temos ar condicionado"
"Been trying to get in touch with our buddies who run the flea market Bar down from the Iberostar. Irma played havoc with it. Their phones must have lost power. If anyone walks down there, please report on the conditions. Someone on here said basically they don't deserve pity as they knew what they were getting into. What a shi$$y statement. This is all some of these folks have in life and we're worried fir them. Thx."
"We will be at the Riu Republica tomorrow afternoon, I'll try to let you know."
Ok so there is a bit of damage at Excellence El Carmen. As well as trees there are also some panels off the outside of the Martini bar and some dislodged glass partitions just above where some rooms are housed. Also informed that the gym is closed as the ceiling has collapsed. As the gym is in the main block where all this other damage is noted it looks like this showpiece part of the resort has taken a bit of a hit.That is still a good 400 yards from Ocean and not sure what's happened the closer to the beach you get.
Anyone at the Punta Cana Princess Resort that can give an update?
Our butler just came by to check on us and see if there was any damage in our room. The buffet is now open and sports bar will open at 11. They'll be showing movies at the sports bar. I'm glad that we can get out of the room. I'm getting cabin fever.
We will be there next week. . Anxious to see your posts once you get there!
"We are at Breathless and are still in the convention center. We have been communicating with our Travel agent who has also been in contact w Apple Vacations. According to Apple Vacations, all guests are back in their rooms at Breathless. This is absolutely false and I question the integrity and motives of Apple Vacations. I will never again book through Apple Vacations or any agency that represents Apple Vacations."
Traveling to Secrets Cap Cana PC on Sunday...has there been much storm damage to this resort? Flooding? Rains still coming in?
Hope all is well with everyone. Anyone know if there was any damage to Majestic Elegance? Debating whether to cancel or not. There are 18 of us scheduled to arrive next week. Any updates would be greatly appreciated.
"We are supposed to be flying there on Sunday, anything we can bring in our luggage to help some of the locals around PC?"
"How did the hotel stand up against the storm. How are the streets of Punta Cana? I am traveling there from Oct. 13 -16, 2017 and wanted to know if I should postpone my trip.Thank you,Amoore"
It's pouring with rain at Dreams PB now
Do you have electricity?
Yes but only within the convention center where we are housed. (Breathless Punta Cana)
"We are back in our room at clubhouse riu bambu, restaurant was open, we just had breakfast, our room is at the back end of the complex near the beach, there's no flooding, couple of Palm trees down, we have power and WiFi, just like a windy rainy day at home in the UK except warmer. Hoping the rain stops before we go home on monday"
Sent a message and was told people have water in their rooms and no flights coming in!
I'm in the Majestic Mirage directly facing the Elegance. It looks like most of the damage was isolated to roofing tiles and trees down. I don't see anything else at the moment but I'm sure we'll hear more throughout the day.
I hope everyone is doing ok who are actually there in Punta Cana now.......and the poor locals!Does anyone have any info on the Bahia Principle Esmeralda? I am scheduled to arrive on the 25th? Does Punta Cana have power right now?
Thank you Alex C for the update. Please keep me posted as the day progresses. Hope you get to enjoy the rest of your trip
"On a sidenote, just gone on thomson website to check on flights and it seems to be down!! Have been thoroughly disgusted by their lack of professionalism during all this and shall not be booking with them again"
Thanks for the update! Please post any updates.
Thomson website is running ok and flights resume tomorrow for the postponed ones and everything is normal for sat and sun . We fly out on saturday and will just wait until we see an update about our hotel as everyone asking about hotel updates.We more concerned about the locals and the hotel staff.Hotels will repair quickly and be up and running within 24 to 48 hours but will take longer for local businesses and people
well said...
So happy to hear this !!! Everyone stay safe
"@derbyshiretina - what would you expect them to do - specifically? They moved all their Weds and Thursday flights - either bringing people home early or delaying people in the UK - with pro-rata refunds for days missed. Offered to cancel or rebook others, with discounts - have kept people in hotels when they are safe to do so, or moved them if the advice was that it wasn't safe. The hotels are responsible for their guests and for informing them, and are working on the advice of the authorities. The Thomson website at this moment in time is not down, and their travel information is very clear:thomson.co.uk/destinations/…hurricane-maria"
Just saw pictures of Punta Cana Princess Lobby and Beach. Lobby is open air has water and some roof damage in the seating area. Beach bar is gone. Palapas and trees down all over resort. Some roof damage to buildings. No other word yet from my friends down there.
Here is the Apple Vacations website with hotel policies/status. Hope it helps.applevacationsblog.com/hotel-policy-punta-ca…
What is the impact of Hurricane Maria in PC? Any major damage?I am flying out next week and I would like to know what to expect when I get there. Thanks!
Hi  We changed our flights to fly in Saturday and we are staying at secrets cap cana. Please let me know how the conditions of the resort is and weather. Thank you
Where were these pictures? Scheduled to arrive on Saturday
"I think Thomsons have dealt with it very well . Everyone was kept safe by the hotels , they postponed flights on the weds and thurs for the hurricane and have clearly stated everything including new flight times etc on website.They did not over react or under react.What did you expect them to do ?"
Novidades sobre o Catalonya Royal Bávaro?
Does anyone know the status of The Reserve Paradisus Punta Cana? The family and I will be traveling out there soon.
We are scheduled to arrive at the Princess Bavaro on Saturday so If you attach a link to the pictures that would be amazing. Trying to assess the damage.
"1278: ""I think Thomsons have dealt with it very well...(they) have clearly stated everything including new flight times etc on website.""Not everyone looks at the website. Believe it or not, not everyone uses the internet...especially on their phones during their vacation! If they have reps at the hotels that should be the primary contacts. If their clientele are supposed to be looking at the website what's the purpose of the reps at the hotel? Also, they posted this info recently. Many people were update at Thomsons prior to the storm when no info was being provided anywhere.All one has to do is go back to see that Thomsons said ""The storm took an unexpected turn"". At that point they went into defense mode to minimize the issues they caused."
Any updates on Hard Rock?
I think once they had the info on the track being 90 miles etc of the coast they responed by changing flight plans etc.As long as everyone is safe and secure and no lives lost that is the most important thing here
It's gonna be raining for the next 10-15 days in PC. That's awful for those who are comming on the next weeks.
Does anyone know if there is damage at the hard rock in punta cana
What are you basing that on?
"""It's gonna be raining for the next 10-15 days in PC. That's awful for those who are coming on the next weeks."" Not sure about that weather prediction..."
"Panayotes, # 1285.. no it's not !"
Scheduled to Fly out on Saturday to RIU REPUBLICA... Any updates on the status of that hotel would be great ?
Who has told you it will be raining for 15 days?I think your find the sun will be shinning by weekend but Mike will answer that one.
i am also curious on this... i just looked at the weather forecast and it says sun Tuesday...
"FYI, Just updated on Bavaro Princess Resort & Casino's facebook page:Dear friends and followers: In order to keep you updated with the hurricane Maria situation. We will like to inform you that, fortunately it did not impact the area directly, so no major incidents were resister. Just some damage on our gardens Again we want to thank all our employees and guest for their collaboration following the protocols. The following days we are expecting to have some more rains, but not any kind of alert. So Little by little our hotels are restoring the normal services as the weather allows us."
"1283 and 1286..........I would imagine the Hard Rock is fine, it is very far off the beach and there is a cement wall the entire front. Other that debris from trees etc, I can't see it being damaged. Just a guess."
"""I think once they had the info on the track being 90 miles etc of the coast they responded by changing flight plans etc.""That's just making excuses for them. Nearly every other airline and travel company made plans well in advance. Planes can make flight pattern changes at a moments notice with thunderstorms and such. Their overall response was poor, as reflected in the many concerns people posted.Yes, everyone was safe. That's because the hotels stepped up when Thomsons was hiding."
Hope that this predictions are wrong.Just saw it in websites.https:/…DR
What was your outcome? I am scheduled to arrive in 2 weeks
That's so good to hear! We are flying in on Wednesday and staying at the rui bamboo! Please keep sending updates about rui bamboo please!
"Hello, and thank your for the report. Are you there now? My sister is due to arrive on her honeymoon on Wednesday at Excellence El Carmen. I'm trying to get a feel for the damage to the resort and upcoming weather. They will take a financial hit if they cancel, but I would rather they cancel if it won't be enjoyable. Any additional information is greatly appreciated."
Gran Ventana beach resort in Puerto Plata have done a 11 min video from an hour ago to show Puerto Plata is all ok . It's on there facebook page if anyone is interested.
Flying out on the 27th just wondering if there was any update on the Now Garden Punta Cana?
Curious to hear about the expected storm surge. Has this danger dissipated?
"I know people are asking about resort after resort, but if anyone could pipe in about dream spa not dream palm, in Punta cana, I will be forever grateful! Going Oct 7th with over 40 people for a wedding."
"What a crazy comment, enlighten me where you got this information please?"
"Us also, We'll arrive on the 5th and stay till the 16th at the Bavero Beach Adults only side. Hope there's no more hurricane's upcoming"
"Have read statement on Thomsons and it does not say about hurricane path shifting , however on Thomas cook they did say the hurricane shifted overnight lol"
"To everyone asking about the status of your resort.... please contact your Travel Agent, airline or the Resort directly. I can guarantee airlines are in contact with reps and agents are on the phone all morning...and will be for the rest of the day getting as many answers as they can. Thanks.Edited: 2 years ago "
How is the resorts there today I suppose to be there on October 2nd just trying to stay updated
"Afternoon, hope you all well and safe. Me and my partner are due to travel to Sensatori on the 17/10/17 would you be so kind and let us know what is the damage when you back at the hotel ? We are quite worried and thinking about re booking. Thank you so much"
HI I believe if you go to Excellence El Carmen web site or blog - they have special instructions if cancelling due to Hurricane Maria......
"In all my 20+ years of travelling to Aruba, Jamaica, Bahamas, Antigua, Cuba, Barbados, Dominican Republic, DO NOT BELIEVE in predictions from the Weather Channel or others predicting rain rain rain in the next coming weeks. I have travelled every October to gorgeous sunny weather with some clouds and the rain comes at night.I always say predictions are for gypsies.Have faith people, better weather is coming!"
My wife and I are currently staying at Now Larimar resort on our honeymoon. We are still told to stay in our rooms until further notice. The staff has been great to us keeping us informed. Still raining quite a bit. We have a pool view on 3rd floor and never had to relocate. Looks like fairly minimal damage to pool area. Tree branches all over but not much else we can see. I'm sure the beach is in much rougher shape. Best case scenario we hope to get out of our rooms this evening for dinner but have not heard yet. A bit of cabin fever setting in but no complaints.

"1309: ""I can guarantee airlines are in contact with reps and agents are on the phone all morning...and will be for the rest of the day getting as many answers as they can.""After Irma, many people complained their travel agents were unaware of conditions. I'm keeping track of Excellence El Carmen, and pictures posted on Facebook show some damage, mostly minor stuff to glass and overhangs.At this point, I'm sure other people are posting to Facebook regarding their resorts, and that's probably the best, most up to date way people can find out about the resorts. Travel agencies and airlines are probably overrun with calls right now, with no real updates until they understand the full extent of any damages and travel delays."
"keep us posted. I'm not going until oct 9, but still concerned"
"How is everything down there now, Mike?"
"Just called punta cana airport. They said minimal damage, and will be resuming flights as early as today for some airlines. For those asking about melia caribe.. i Just got off of the phone with them and they reported minimal damage as well. They have some cleanup to do, but nothing effecting operations. For those blasting others for worrying about their trips, this is a TRAVEL FORUM. Pretty safe to say people who are traveling are going to discuss traveling on this website. Most of us feel bad for those harmed by these horrible storms, but i work three jobs and bust my butt to relax for 7 days of nny life so frankly your comments about how insensitive we are don't phase me. It is actually possible to care about others, and yourself at the same time.Id like to bring goods to donate. Any locals care to share what will be needed on that level?Pc mike, thanks bro i watched your comments more than the media and appreciate your valuable info. Please post where i can send a donation to you personally.Safe travels everyone!"
"I'm heading over to TUI sensatori Punta Cana, due out of manchester tomorrow morning, rescheduled from Today. We've been kept really up to date with changes and made aware our right to cancel for a full refund or ammend. Thomson have seemed to do this well and are getting round to people who are travelling later, prioritizing people already out and passengers due to fly out imminently.Hope all is well otherwise!We're also being refunded pro-rata for the day we missed today, and will receive that once out there. We should be arriving by 5pm GMT tomorrow , along with many others but will highlight anything to help peoples expectations.."
A 10 minute tour of the area. Thank you Ramon!https:/…Music isn't bad either.
My daughter leaves for her honeymoon to Sanctuary Cap Cana by Alsol tomorrow the 22nd can anyone tell me the conditions at this resort?I have been reading but I have no clue..... I am just a worried mom trying to make sure they are going to be ok. The travel agent said everything is up and running??? But I would like to hear from someone that is actually there if you know what I mean.CONCERNED MOMEdited: 2 years ago 
All appears good at the RIU REPUBLICA. See you all next Wednesday!https:/…nullEdited: 2 years ago 
@DanR we've been evacuated from Sensatori and told we won't return until Friday evening maybe Saturday afternoon. So no idea how you're going.
Just an FYI that is a pretty normal forecast. Inland gets rain and sometimes rains for ten minutes. Don't overly concern yourself with the weather forcasting. Next day or two will have remnants of Maria but then it will be back to the normal weather pattern.
"We had breakfast at the Majestic Mirage buffet. There was a downpour of rain but it has let up for now. The staff is out there cleaning up the water and other debris. There doesn't appear to be major structural damage at Majestic Mirage as far as we can see but I haven't gone through the entire resort. I imagine that the resort will be back up and running to normal operations very soon. Staff is doing a great job of letting us know what's open and closed at this time. For example, the main lobby is currently closed. It's a wide open area so they probably closed it in order to clean up the excess water, etc. The marble floors can be slippery and they want to make sure that the guests are safe."
Please let me know of the conditions of this resort I am traveling there next week
"Thank you for the update and very much appreciated. Our honeymoon trip and our first vacation in 10 years will be to Secret Royal in 4 days. Very relieved to learn that most everyone and properties are fairing well in DR considering the circumstances. Also, a shout out to all who have braved the hurricane/storm and kindly posting updates. Peace be with all."
which resort?
"I've had absolutely no issues with my agent or airline. I can only speak for Canada at this point, they've been really great. Either way, the forum is being filled with questions regarding the same resorts... please scroll down and flip through the last 5 pages and I'm sure you'll see an answer. You can follow resorts on the FB and IG pages. You can go on IG and use locations to see tags.. there are tons of other ways to be proactive in finding out how your resort is doing."
There is a group on fb called sanctuary travelers or something - you could post on there . There are people there now that are in the group .Edited: 2 years ago 
"Quick update from Dreams PB. We have been allowed back to our rooms. There is damage to the hotel with roof tiles off, trees down etc. The buffet and lobby bar are open and I imagine everything will be back to normal tomorrow. Just need the sunshine!"

Lynn B there is a group on fb called sanctuary cap cana travelers or something and some people that are currently there are posting about it in the group. The most I've seen is that a window blew in .
any damage to Gran Bahia Principle and Ambar?
"Update from Now Onyx Fan Page;""Hi all - my son and party of four are guests at Now Onyx and they were moved to Breathless yesterday. Is there any word if they will ship them back to Now Onyx or was the damage significant enough that it's not deemed safe to return to their rooms?"""
It's saying it's a closed group.....
"https:/…This was live not long ago, a report or two people asked about."
"Excellence el carmen made it thru the hurricane without too much damage. A lot of debris, some trees damaged and some buildings with damage. We heard the beach is a mess, as well as bars and restaurants near the water. Buffet opened for breakfast. Bars opened at 11 am. More restaurants gradually opening. Overall, not too bad. Still having lots of wind and rain."
"Punta Cana Mike, Do you by chance know if there was any damage to Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe? We are scheduled to arrive 9/30. Would you recommend rescheduling or anticipate sunny skies and clean up within the week? Thank you"
Hi greg my daughter is in grand bahia. Damage to a few palm trees it seems that's it
"No, everything is fine here at Bahia Principe...exept for the Rain, which seems to stop like NEVER -.-"
thanks for the info going to elegance on the 28th hope everything will be back to normal
"Can anyone report any damage to the Bahia complex? Esmeralda, the Amber's,Fantasia,etc.Please let everyone know."
thank you. Will be there in a couple weeks
"Here is an email my travel agent sent that she got from the Riu web site:Update Thursday, September 21 – 12.30 pm (GMT +1) ""Fortunately, we can confirm that hurricane Maria didn’t cause any significant damage in the two RIU hotels in Puerto Plata and that all the guests and colleagues are fine.  The only damages caused by the storm at our hotels in Punta Cana and Puerto Plata occurred in the gardens due to the heavy rains and wind. The maintenance teams are already working to restore normality. As of today, Thursday 21, the eight RIU hotels in the Dominican Republic will be 100% operational and offering full service to their clients""."
"My flight is next Wed 27th to Majestic Mirage. If I have an option of cancelling the trip, and get half of my money refunded, should I still come? Thanks!"
"Hi, we arrived here at the Bavaro Princess Resort on Tuesday and the heavy winds and rain started early Wednesday. Last night was pretty amazing to watch how powerful this storm was. Considering it was 50 miles off shore, it still did some damage here. I watched from my terrace most of the evening as huge trees came crashing down. Fortunately minimal structural damage as most trees missed the buildings and the workers here have been excellent at clearing the pathways - the Police Department have just arrived to help with the clear up. Staff have all been very helpful and made the stay as comfortable as possible given the circumstances.Light rain and winds now...hoping for some sunshine later in the week/next week.If you want to see any footage, I pretty much vlogged the whole evening and then the aftermath this morning. You can go on to my facebook page and watch it here if you want...https://www.facebook.com/deano.thurstonGood luck on your travels wherever you go."
"Hey BigKC #1,314. Congratulations on your marriage and thanks for the report on Now Larimar. Due out there in 3 weeks to celebrate our 21st anniversary. Any further updates would be appreciated. Enjoy the rest of your honeymoon"
"Hello, what resort did you stay at? I'm getting married on Saturday and we are flying out to Punta cana on Monday September 25th and I'm trying to figure out if we should cancel"
"Hi there! Thanks everyone for keeping this updated. I bet it is helping a lot of travelers around the world who are going to PC. I just hope that things are ok with the locals too, of course (PC Mike, I hope everything is ok for your family). For those who are going to stay at the Catalonia Royal Bavaro, I just called this number +1 (809) 412-0011 and the lady who talked to me (in Spanish) said that the hotel is working properly. A few palm trees damaged the garden a bit, but they are cleaning everything now and tomorrow should everything should be ok. She also told me that they have electricity - which I guess is by generators. She was not clear about it, though. I hope is all true since I'm arriving tomorrow afternoon!"
Hopefully headed there on Monday. Looking for info as well.
Any news about the condition of the airport? I know most flights out today are cancelled
"any word on royalton punta cana , arriving this Saturday"
What is the status of the Secrets resort in Punta Cana? I assume okay. Arriving October 8th

Hi.Anyone knows about the current condition of the Paradisus Punta Cana resort? Any info about this resort will be greatly appreciated!
Maria has passed the islandhttps://www.windy.com/…Edited: 2 years ago 
Thanks all for posting updates to individual resorts. If anyone has any information on Dreams Punta Cana Resort in Uvera Alto? Were guest allowed to stay? Thanks all.
Hi. I am in Punta Cana. Little damages in the streets. The rain and the wind are over. You could use the beaches and pools next saturday because they have to clean. All the hotels are working 100%.
"Maria missed?Well, the eye of the hurricane and its strongest hurricane force winds missed. But it wasn't expected to hit anyway. It certainly had an effect on the island though. Thankfully so far it's relatively minor damage at the resorts with no serious issues or injuries."
Can anyone provide an update on the status of the Catalonia Royal Bavaro. We are coming in on the 23rd and I have been unable to make contact with anyone at the hotel/resort? No updates on their Facebook Page either.
See post 1352
Justin - numerous people have responded in this very thread just before your post about your resort.
#1363To the best of my knowledge Dreams Punta Cana was evacuated to a hotel in Santo Domingo yesterday. According to some guest posts on their facebook page they have reported some damage to a roof and a few trees down. No word as to when they may return to the resort.
"Hi Justin, I posted about the hotel a few minutes ago. I was able to call them in this number +1 (809) 412-0011. Everything seems to be ok there. I'm arriving tomorrow"
Fernando G - have you heard anything about the Punta Cana airport? I can’t get anyone to answer the phone. We arrive tmrw afternoon as well. Thanks
I am going on October 7th and I am concerned as well. I'm considering going somewhere else.
Thanks for posting the videos!
All guests were evacuated from Dreams Punta CAna. Personally we are at a quality inn in Santo Domingo. We have a meeting in 90 minutes for more info but they advised us this morning there had been significant damage and they were unclear as to what will happen in the coming days.
"The guests evacuated from Secrets Cap Cana aren't due back till around 13pm local time on Friday so we won't be able to confirm re damage till then but I'll be sure to update you as soon as possible, but if going to Secrets Cap Cana I really wouldn't worry they will do everything to get the resort tip top of it has suffered any damage, we have been very well looked after and are looking forward to returning on Friday to complete our holiday"
"So glad to hear everyone is all ok and no lives lost , Keeping fingers crossed that PCMIKE has done his inspections to his property and all is ok with him and his family.Just packing our suitcases as we off to gatwick tomorrow for our flight on Saturday.We have not heard from our hotel but reading between the lines all should be ok within next 24 / 48 hours.For those asking about October and Nov everything will be as normal i would think.For those flying out this weekend , happy holidays and safe trip"
Thank you everyone for the updates! Very glad to know that everyone is safe and the damage isn't major.
Does any one know if there was any damage to Bahia Principe? Pools open? Beaches Open?
been back and forth with someone that rode it out at Sirenis further up coast - they are just now able to get out and about - some damage (mostly vegetation) but doesn't look bad. Few pics just taken.https:/…PVl8g7aT.jpghttps:/…aeJ-_839.jpghttps:/…qBnRhRyp.jpghttps:/…h0sJ_cj6.jpg
"If you are unsure whether a specific hotel has sustained damage, you could try to find it on Instagram as there are many travellers that have posted videos during and after the hurricane"
I heard the bahia principle resort is up and running again have just asked someone on their fb page & says everything is fine.
Do you mean this coming Saturday or the following? Thanks
Delta 9857 from ATL is in the air and on time to PUJ - arrival 4:30
"Thank you for your post! It helped calm my nerves about our upcoming trip Sunday! Be safe, conserve battery, but let us know of anything of note you find!"
"meaux111- The information I received from the travel agency is that most of the flights arriving today were cancelled and the power was off preventively at the airport in the morning. However, the services should be normal in the afternoon today. That's what they told me.Edited: 2 years ago "
Hi Everyone. This thread has been incredibly helpful. We travel to Punta Cana every year and the majority of the time during Hurricane Season. Looks like our Paradise has some damage but could have been much worse.We'll be returning on the 30th once again but this time to the Royalton. Appreciate if anyone has information on this resort.
"jackieteach345This coming saturday , now looking forward to our trip and seeing old friends and staff at the hotel"
"I'm interested if anyone has been staying at the Iberostar Grand Hotel Bavaro? If so, how are the conditions after Maria. I'll be there in three weeks."
Interested to hear what comes of the Dreams Punta Cana meeting. We are to go there next Saturday.Edited: 2 years ago 
Does any one know if Saona Island and Chavon river are ok? We are doing the deluxe tour / lobster lunch on the beach.
Me too! Going the 7th.
"i've jus spoken to the rep in the reservation dept @ transat, she said their will be compensation for the trip interruption."
We are checking in to the Dreams Domenicus la romana on September 24. We fly into punta cana. Was there any damage?
"So glad I found this thread. Thank you all for your contributions, you have been amazing. I am set to arrive the 28th to grand bahia principe turquesa, and reading this instead of listening to the news has me so excited instead of worried to go. Believing all will be well not just for us tourists, but also for the people who live there!"
Flying in to punta cana tomorrow staying at majestic elegance. Hoping for safe travels and looking forward to seeing my familiar faces.
"I am staying in dreams palm beach and due to fly out tomorrow at 10:30am. Heard nothing from Thomson, seen small comments saying the whole hotel has been evacuated. So worried. Not sure what to do"
Guest's from onyx being moved to breathless. Talk is that it's not bad but will take a day or two to sort. Please don't panic if your due to arrive tomorrow you will be well looked after. Breathless workers are quickly getting this place back to normal and the sky has cleared and the wind dropped :)
"Update- finally got through & was told by bookit.com rep that Princess Bavaro Beach Resort/ Casino will be ""fully operational"" by tomorrow (Friday)."
Just gone down to beach at Excellence El Carmen. Whilst buildings seem intact what a sad sight. Big clean up needed and I can't see beach or pool being in use for at least 2-3 days. Cant believe it's the same pristine idyllic spot of only 2 days ago.
"Is that dreams resort and spa , or the dreams near the airport? Any help would be appreciated, we arrive at dreams resort and spa. Not sure what to do"

Leaving Sunday for Majestic Elegance in Punta Cana. Can anyone give me information? Is the resort up and operational? Is the power on and the air conditioning working?
"Mish, go to there FB page !!!!"
Ime going there on Monday hopefully glad people are OK with minimal damage
So glad to hear this - especially about the Breathless resort - we are going next week! Yippee!!!
Foxy Totally agree. I think Thomson have done well really considering all this was out of their hands.You still planning on flying on Saturday? We are all set to fly out tomorrow

The webcam at the Palladium shows little damage there on the beach. It looks like Bavaro fared better than uvera alto where excellence el carmen is. Looking forward for PC Mike and his priceless insights. We can all be relieved that PC didn't get a direct hit. It could have been so much worse. I will be there tomorrow!
Does anyone have any information on damage to The Punta Cana Princess resort?
Foxy where you staying?
Also if you are new to this forum if you switch the box that states OLDEST to NEWEST then you can read the most recent threads
We staying at the Iberostar costa dorada from the 23rd sept
I am supposed to be getting to Dreams Punta Cana on Oct 3rd for my wedding on Oct 7th. I haven't heard back from my wedding coordinator but I have been hopeful and positive reading some of the updates. Can anyone inform me on the status of the resort at Dreams Punta Cana?
Connor P - Thomson put out a statement on Tuesday saying all passengers due to fly to DR between Weds 20th and Fri 22nd had the opportunity to amend/rebook free of charge.
Airport supposed to be opening today at 4pm
God Bless all who are in the way of this storm in the Punta Can area!Don & Jan from RI-USA

"Frick, post #1375:""All guests were evacuated from Dreams Punta CAna. Personally we are at a quality inn in Santo Domingo. We have a meeting in 90 minutes for more info but they advised us this morning there had been significant damage and they were unclear as to what will happen in the coming days.""Stay tuned. Sure travelers will post to let you know what came out of the meeting."
Hello FridayI am also going to Riu Republica on Monday Can u Please give me an update on the condition of the resort ThanksMark
Mark - there were posts for all RIU' a few pages back. Apparently every RIU property is in good shape and should be back up and running at 100% capacity in the next day or so!
I just received this response from Evelyn Ramirez-Guest relations for Barceló Bavaro Beach.we dont have any damage at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach from Hurricane Maria
Hi my daughters there. Just up and running now. Palm tree or two gone over. Beach a bit of a mess but easily cleared in a day or two..reduced staff due to problems on the road preventing them getting there but all ok... waiting for sunshine now
"I am leaving Saturday, September 30th for Barcelo Barvaro Beach Resort. Does anyone have the status of this resort?"
Re: 1423. Which Dreams location are you speaking of?
I am leaving Saturday. September 30th for Punta Cana. We are staying at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Resort. Does anyone have any status?
"Just got off the phone to Thomson, sensatori in uvero alto is without power so we will be taken to Meliá Caribe Tropical on arrival for 1 night and refunded that night of our holiday, based on the full cost of the holiday not just hotel costs. Can't fault Thomson at the moment"
MelindaLook at post 1423. It looks good. I will be there tomorrow.
"Sorry, post 1426"
My daughter was staying at the Dreams Resort & Spa Punta Cana and was evacuated yesterday. She was not hearing much except she has to spend another night where she is at. Would like to know what you find out at the meeting.
"I have searched through this forum and Im not finding any info on Now Larimar and nothing on the facebook page. Can anyone update me on this? Due to leave Monday night , Thanks"
Going there in 2 weeks. Hope u are safe but your update would be appreciated :)
We are here now at now larimar punta cana it's fine some cosmetic damage like fallen trees but the hotel has been fantastic and are clearing up as I type. I'm sure we all be back in the pool tomorrow.Edited: 2 years ago 
Our daughter and son in law are staying at Chic in uvero alto; they were relocated yesterday but as of now still have not heard anything about the status of the resort (Chic) or plans for the remainder of their stay. Is the weather improving?
Anyone with any info on Nickalodean/Senatori?? Any damages?
"@ TinaKI just spoke to NOW Larimar, they said everything will be up and running from tomorrow. No major damage. I am flying on Thursday 28th."

""Our hotel remains well after the hurricane, we have no damage to the structure and more importantly all the people (guests and staff) are fine.

This was posted elsewhere by F:I just received this response from Evelyn Ramirez-Guest relations for Barceló Bavaro Beach.we dont have any damage at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach from Hurricane Maria.
"@cherieshepard - Maybe people aren’t replying because there’s already been plenty of obvious information on here, and people are trying to enjoy their holiday, than sit on the Internet. Things seem fine, some resorts are a little more damaged than others - particularly in Uver Alto."
"We are still in the shelter at Breathless. But we were told to get back to our rooms in an hour, ie 5pm. Weather doesnt look that bad any more outside, but they still need time to clean the rooms. The roof seems to have had some damage but it doesnt seem to be a major problem. The service today will be limited. Tomorrow already getting better with some restaurants and bars opening at Breathless and Now Onyx. Some of the employees cant get here due to weather conditions and restricted street access. But they are doing their best to make things get back to normal asap."

iam new at this! But let me tell everyone thank you so much for the kind words and welcoming me to this feed that is full of smart donkeys
Mark I would like to know how the Riu Republica did also because it is not near all the other Riu’s it is by th Hard Rock in Arena Gorda . My husband and I are going in November.
Delta 9857 from ATL just landed at PUJ. One day shut down of airport ..... piece of cake compared to the poor people on St Thomas - Puerto Rico - etc -etc -etc.
"so, do you think you will go still? have you heard about anything down there on damage? just curious because we are suppose to go same time."
November Really!!!
"Statement on RUI websiteUpdate Thursday, September 21 – 12.30 pm (GMT +1)Fortunately, we can confirm that hurricane Maria didn’t cause any significant damage in the two RIU hotels in Puerto Plata and that all the guests and colleagues are fine. The only damages caused by the storm at our hotels in Punta Cana and Puerto Plata occurred in the gardens due to the heavy rains and wind. The maintenance teams are already working to restore normality. As of today, Thursday 21, the eight RIU hotels in the Dominican Republic will be 100% operational and offering full service to their clients."
My heart goes out to all of those in the Caribbean that has been affected by both hurricanes.....
"Live report from Puerto Plata 1 hour agoMaria has NOT technically ""passed"" Puerto Plata yet... BUT, the current NW direction she is on is taking her further away from the north shore of the DR, away from Puerto Plata. Much less trees and limbs down, no destruction... Irma was worse. We have dodged TWO bullets... Yes, much rain, wind... but we will all be OK"
We are now back to our rooms at Breathless. There is no damage inside the room. Beach and pool area are closed for today until further notice due to strong winds and waves. Main restaurant will open from 8-10 for dinner. Lets hope that weather will improve soon. And esp that local people dont have to suffer too much. For us it's a few days limited fun. For local Dominicans there is much more at stake here.
"I'm staying at the grand bahia principle bavaro in 3 weeks , I have heard there is just superficial damage to hotel but nothing that won't be sorted in a few days."
I want to thank PC Mike and everyone else who has contributed here. I hope all of those that lived through the hurricane are safe and well. Also thank you for share the Palladium link to the web cam — made it that much easier to have a visual. I'll be at the Esmeralda with my husband and child from the 28th to the 5th. Hope I get to see one of you!Edited: 2 years ago 
"On Hard Rock website:We’re pleased to report Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Punta Cana only sustained minor cosmetic and landscape damage in Hurricane Maria's path. We're grateful all guests and employees are safe and that the property was not greatly affected. At this time, the hotel is solely activating inside facilities and restaurants, as other areas of the property are being cleaned and set-up. Once outdoor facilities re-open, we will be sure to inform all guests."
"Hi, I arrive at PUJ on Saturday at 2:45pm, staying at Breathless from Sat 23rd - Fri 29th. Any updates on the resort?Thank you!"
"Angie bHave you even read the last few posts , someone from breathless on first page reporting from hotel"
I am very glad to see that all the people were safe and sound and that damage doesn't seem to be that bad. We arrive on Wednesday sept 27 our anniversary to secrets cap cana was wondering if anyone may of heard or seen how that resort made out. Also I have to thank pic mike he made us feel very relaxed about the whole scenario so thank you mike.Edited: 2 years ago 
Arriving in Punta Cana on Monday any updates on Iberostar Bavaro Suites
"Hello, hope you are safe, we are coming on 10/14 to Catalonia Royale, could you please update me how everything looks- off especially the beach and weeds which they had a lot off for last few years. I appreciate it. Have a great time, enjoy your vacation! Can't wait to be there, thanks."
"Hello, I am wondering if anyone knows if Chic by royalton survived hurricane Maria?"
"I'm currently at the paradisus in the reserve section. All is well here, no major damage. We have electricity, running water and wifi. It's raining off and on and windy off and on and every now and then the power will go out but goes back on in a few minutes. The staff are in great spirits. My family and I spent the morning and after noon dancing and playing games at a bar/restaurant."
"Does anyone know how ""The Occidental"" held up? Do they have power or phone service? My best friend is staying there and I haven't been able to reach her today. Thanks for any info!"
"Thank you so much, coming your way on 10/14 to Catalonia Royale. Have a great time!!!!"

Good to hear. Do you know how Secrets resort is? Right next to you so I assume the same
Arriving in punta cana next Sunday to ocean blue hotel. Any updates on how they are doing?
Any news about the Secrets Royal Beach Resort in Punta Cana?
chelskHave you read the previous posts in this thread?
I know some people are constantly asking about resorts when people have already posted about them! But does anyone know anything from the meeting regarding dreams Punta Cana resort and spa? Have read every single post and don’t know anything about this hotel apart from there was going to be a meeting a couple of hours ago
"Good to hear! Would you kindly ask, if you are able, if they expect to operate normally?"
"Regarding Iberostar Bavaro Suites....landscape and lots of beach palapas damaged but resort should be OK in several days. Doing what they can to cut palms and clear paths. Someone asked about Grand Bravaro...please call them....it was closed when we came and the guard said renovation but looked like dame from Irma??? We had a language barrier though, so not sure, but definitely not open already. No pool or beach today and tons of clean up needed next few days, but no structural damage to actual resort we could tell outside beach area. We did get hit hard with winds...."
Please post your questions here. If you do not get a timely answer it could be because of limited internet or other reasons not related to damage. Check the resort's FB page. Many resorts also have unofficial sites run by fans.
"Praise goes out to our dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus Christ! Our whole family in Michigan and Indianahave been praying that he would stop the storm and begin healing all the destruction!We pray that all the people in the hurricanes paths would continue to be safe and that they have wisdomand discernment for all that they need/do.Our son that lives and works in Punta Cana has been talking with us about the storms and has beensuch a comfort. Considering the shape of the island of D.R. and the placement of it helps in timesof storms to protect it along with all the coral out surrounding the island and the deepness of thewater between Puerto Rico and D. R.We will hopefully be leaving for LaRomana Oct 3rd for celebration number one that people will be okand better and number two for our anniversary...........God bless all you travelers too that have had such trying times on your vacations this week and honeymooners.................................Again hello to all the wonderful , sweet people in the D. R........that is whywe have been going for the last 12 years................believe it or not...always in October........"
Thank you! I couldn't get any information from the hotel. I'm arriving on the 30th and I need to know if they are expecting to operate normally.
Here are some photos from Iberostar and some other resorts. Just click different pages. My Russian friend has been posting on that forum. Looks pretty bad in some places...https://ftour.otzyv.ru/read.php…
Sensatori damaged. No power till Saturday. So idk how people are supposed to turn up Friday.
Hi Alex! Everything is Ok there? Im going puntacana on next monday! So I dont know how about overthere it is Ok for us or not. I asked the airline but My trip isnt cancel. Thank you so much about Your share experience!
"Also wondering about Chic, we are scheduled to arrive 9/30 so I'm tagging along on this post"

Thank you so much for the update on Iberostar Bavaro. We are schedule to arrive Saturday.Edited: 2 years ago 
Can you give an update on Secrets Cap Cana resort? We are scheduled to arrive on Oct 2nd

Leafs... did AC say why?Edited: 2 years ago 
We are supposed to be going to riu republica early October. Does anyone have any update as to whether or not there was any damage?
No damage to Rius. Check their FB page.
Question. I am going to Majestic Elegance this Saturday 23rd. Any updates on this one ?
I believe I read Majestic was fine. Check he hotel website or FB
Good to know. Thanks for update. My family and I will be there oct 7-14.
Staying at the Grand Bahia resort just now. Only issues were a few palm tree branches down and minor flooding on the paths around the resort. Only the lobby and buffet was open today as some staff were struggling to get to work. No major damage or flooding. Hoping to be at the pool tomorrow.
Debinatore #1506No explanation.Just posted it on website.My travel agent did not even know.They had dropped the price by $500 earlier in the day so I suspect they simply do not have a full plane.Just using the hurricane as a way to avoid their obligation to provide our trip as booked.
Hello any new about now onyx?? I'm arrive Saturday 23 with my family thanks
"Hi all!Me and my wife are going to arrive in Barcelo Bavaro in sep/24th, does anybody have any info about this resort?Should be better for me to re-schedule my trip to Oct/7th?Thanks"
No problem there at Bavaro.
Have not seen anything from PC mike in a while. Anyone know if he's okay
Any word on the weather forecast for next week?
Ana try reading the posts on here
First I want to say thank you to PC Mike for all the information and updates he's been giving. Second I also want to say thanks to anybody that's updating us on Iberostar Bavaro Suites but they got some really bad pictures on their Facebook page so I'm not sure about going there on Monday
Thank you annoncapecod!
Help! Hoping to get some info on Breathless Punta Cana's condition post Maria? Is there anyone that has any info about breathless or in general how Punta Cana faired?
"I'm part of a Breathless group on Facebook and they said that there was very little damage. Definitely some palms and palpas (SP?) down, but nothing that can't be cleaned up fairly quickly."
"Hi everyone! I'm really sorry to be doing this. My partner and I are scheduled to fly in on Saturday at 6am to the Nickelodeon resort. We are both separated and in order to travel we need consents from our exes. At this point Sunwing cannot advise us if the resort has reopened, but has said that they feel flights will continue to be cancelled for Saturday and we have to call back tomorrow. Unfortunately, if there's a change in plans we need new consents and this isn't allowing for a lot of time. My questions are any news on the Nickelodeon and what is the damage like at the airport/are flights operational? Our 6 am flight as of now has changed to a direct 4 hour flight to a 7 hour flight with a connection to the Bahamas. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much!"
"From someone at Breathless:Breathless Building have no visible damage. Resort has no power due to down wires, and for safety(while staff checks everything). Guests are in shelter(aka conference center). Beach is a bit damaged/washed out, and a lot of small palms/umbrellas are down. They plan to be back in business tomorrow."
Can you please give me the info on the breathless resort info/contact that you referenced.
We are due to arrive at the Melia Tropical Sunday and I am wondering the status on that resort. When I call I am put on hold forever.
"Did the Royalton suffer just cosmetic damage? My trip isn't until November 4th, but still wanted to know the status at the hotel.Thank you."
Any updates on how PC looks from the aftermath?
Any updates how PC looks for the aftermath? Is there a lot of devastation?
"Hello, just wondering if anyone has an update on the Dreams Palm Beach? I have checked the hotel's website and Facebook pages and can't find anything. We are going on Monday and just wanted to see how they weathered Maria. Any information is greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
"Any updates on Luxury Bahai Esmerelda? I haven't seen any info, sorry if I missed it.Thank you :)"

"Hi Ashley,Nickelodeon and Sensatori are the same resort. We are still at a hotel in Santo Domingo. Saturday you will be fine. They are keeping all here until Saturday morning due to the power being down. When you arrive all should be fine. :-)Edited: 2 years ago "
"Any damages to Secrets, will be there in mid October and really looking forward to the trip."
"For those of us coming down in the next few weeks are there things we can bring to help out the locals? Toiletries, etc? Maybe just being generous with tips?Any thoughts/suggestions?"
Thank you :)
Is there anybody not concerned with PC Mike's absence from this thread? I hope he is ok.
"Can anybody who posted earlier from Dreams Punta Cana let us know what the status is or what the meeting was about?I called Dreams and they said everything was good, but there were one or two people on their Facebook page saying they are closed until Sunday. I called Dreams again and they said it wasn't true.Out of curiosity, I called Book It, who I bought my vacation through, and had them do some digging. They reported back that Dreams Punta Cana is closed until Sunday and tried to get me to rebook (except I can't because all the flights are full).I called Dreams one... more... time... and they said Book It couldn't possibly have called Dreams Punta Cana directly because nobody is there right now, but that they will be open in the morning.So I'm pretty confused. Also, I'm pretty unimpressed with how this company is handling things. Ideally, I want something in writing to let me know that if i show up on Saturday I will have a place to stay."
"We were evacuated from Secrets which is next to Now Larimar, by an overly pushy, we won't fly you out if you don't take this flight- Air transat. We spoke to some people we met who are still there, the hotels are fine!"
Definitely concerned! Where's PCMike
Dee - our agent told us Melia is in good shape. Unfortunately the Level not so much. Rooms are fine but the Level Restaurants experienced more severe damage and will be closed for 45 days for Reno. Apparently they will be hosting their meals elsewhere on the resort.
Anyone know of damage to Majestic Mirage?
Looking forward to my trip Oct 18-25 to Grand Bahia Principe Ambar! Seems like most places sustained minimal damage. No more storms please!
"I would feel so much more at ease boarding my plane in 10 hours if PC Mike would post something. Thanks to all that are there for your updates. Greatly appreciated.If it wasn't for this thread, I would have cancelled. Thanks and enjoy what's left of your vacations."
"Hi, are they closing the whole Level resort or just the restaurants? Please if you know anything else, I will appreciate it so much. Thank you!"
Ariel. Just two restaurants! The resort itself is fine!
Newinia - anything else you can share re: the level at melia? I have a group of 26 flying in Saturday early afternoon. I called the resort and they said everything is 100% but for some reason I'm not positive that's true. Any info is helpful!
Is there anybody staying at the Barcelo Palace or the Barcelo Adults Only tonight? I do not recall any updates from anybody that is staying there.
#1501 definitely nothing that would impact on your stay. Their normal extraordinary service will be back in full flow! Even tonight they managed to get a show on!!
"Ali - we are set to arrive Saturday afternoon as well. Travel agent spoke to the resort and they reassured him all was 100% with the exception of 2 Level Restaurants, which will remain closed. I'm getting some more info tomorrow and will share! Our agent said we shouldn't worry about false information, they're generally honest about damages. From images I've seen.. it's just broken branches..debris.. purely cosmetic and should be cleaned over the next couple days!"
Newinia - you're my hero! I'll check back tomorrow for more details :D
I sure hope PC Mike is ok. It is weird not to see his posts for so long! I am set to arrive next Saturday the 29th and staying at Dreams Punta Cana and I am really hoping there isn't too much damage and things can be cleaned up in a timely manner. Nothing like spending tons of money to go on vacation to a tropical paradise that is full of debris. I feel horrible for the people who live there and have to deal with this as part of their livelihoods. Is there anyone who is currently at Dreams to update on the status of it?Thanks!
that is great news -- as we are going to NOW Larimar October 19 -- thanks for the uodate
Hi Kate S. We will be fine in October -- we are going to NOW Larimar Oct. 18- 27th
"PC Mike might still not have any power- ours just went off at the Palladium and we were sat in darkness without water for an hour so I'm assuming we are still running on generators which the locals won't have.I think we might have to move rooms yet again tomorrow- they moved us for the hurricane but this room (which was substandard anyway but we put up with it because we figured they were doing their best in a rubbish situation) now has leaks in the bathroom ceiling and the floor is swimming! We reported it today and they said they would send someone but no one showed up... we missed dinner waiting for someone then the power cut out. I know they probably have a lot of issues at the moment but it's horrible right now- flooding room, power cuts, etc- I thought that as a tourist the actual hurricane would be the most miserable part but for us it's actually the aftermath :-("
Hi everyone my husband and I are scheduled to arrive in Punta Cana on West Jet on Sunday September 24 - staying at the Hard Rock - does anyone have any news or update on the Hard Rock? West Jet hasn't cancelled the flight - just advisory. Thank you !
"Did you go to the HardRock or cancel? I am supposed to go Sunday the 24th but we don't know if we should cancel. I don't want to have a flooded,leaky,moldy hotel room and not sure when the resort will. Be completely open again.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hard rock posted on Twitter that they have only cosmetic damage and damage to landscaping. People are supposed to stay inside the resort buildings until they get the outside debris cleaned up. That's all I know, I'm trying to find out more myself as I'm supposed to go there Sunday."
I just left there early on wed before the hurricane and the level options were not available. First they blamed the Quattro and the adult only level being closed bc of Irma.... they were not... there're just renovating.... super annoying but we complained and got the price of melia tropical. Make sure u get what you paid for....
"Felicia, I am arriving at Dreams PC on the 29th also....let's keep each other updated"
Any news on Chic? We are to arrive in 10/3.
"Jackie what do you mean ""level options weren't available"" - my group is scheduled to stay at the level..."
Hi anyone staying at the grand palladium palace spa and casino is there any damage to the resort? hope everyone is safe x
"You can't fit anything into your luggage what they need. Nice thought, though! Regards"
"HI Liam.If possible could you give an update on Sensatori, please? i.e. what the damage is and how long any repairs might take, if you are privy to such information ? I understand the power is down so any reply might take a while. Much appreciated.Our trip isn't until 16th November so I'm not overly worried at this stage.A big well done to everybody who has contributed to this thread, allaying fears for those about to travel and passing on useful information/updates regarding the Hurricane. People from all over, coming together for the greater good, brilliant !"
"I am booked to stay in sensatori too.. any information about resort would be helpful, i still have time to change it.."
"I am arriving on Monday, 25th September to PC Princess all suites and spa resort. Anybody knows what is the situation at this resort after Maria path? tnx"
"Rasma B, they posted on their facebook page that everything is fine, just a few palm trees down. I think everything will be ok till Monday. I will be there on Thursday! :D"
"Thank you, Jovana. Will check their FB page:-)"
"does anyone know any information regarding Dreams resort and spa punta cana? due to arrive Monday and last I heard there was significant damage and a meeting was taking place yesterday, there are no comments on facebook and Thomas cook does not know what is going on"

Is it me or the Palladium webcams are all offline? Thanks for the response
The Palladium webcam on the beach is workinghttps:/…
"I believe that was Dreams palm near the airport. I called yesterday and was told everything was ok at dreams resort and spa. I'm arriving tomorrow, so I hope she was right"
"Anyone have an update on Dreams Resort and spa. Leaving Saturday the 23rd, Hope you are all safe , and PC Mike... You are awesome .. Thanks for all your updates..."
Yay PC Mike is back good to hear that you're okay Mike thanks for keeping us updated
"#1588 Tom, I believe you were misinformed. I'm pretty sure Dreams Palm is o.k. and that Dreams Punta Cana Spa was damaged and won't be open for a few more days. According to reports on facebook one of Dreams Spa buildings lost a roof. Everyone was evacuated to Santo Domingo from Dreams Spa on Wednesday."
Any word on the airport and roads to and from the resorts. My group is due to arrive Thursday at Riu palace Macao. Any word would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Any damage to Sensatori Resort Punta Cana
The airport is running as per usual as planes arriving today
"@charliesouth #1593, Sensatori resort was evacuated Wednesday and they are staying at the same hotel I am at in Santa Domingo (Sheraton) and believe none of the guest are returning until today at the earliest."
2 Thomson planes one from gatwick and one from manchester in the air now on way to punta cana.All is good
@magnific1 sensatori are not returning until Saturday.
Hi Brenda I I read the same thing about the Hard Rock but I'm going to call today and get more info - we booked this trip for the Legends of Paradise way back in March - who knew huh ?? I'll post what I find out - we've pretty much decided that iif our flight is flying and not cancelled we are going regardless - we've been there before and the staff are amazing so I'm sure they are working hard to make the LOP week the best it can be - fingers crossed ☀️
We've been evacuated from Sensatori. All we know is the power is out until Saturday. Which has ruined our holiday. We were supposed to go back today (Friday) but we're not.Thomson have no idea really what's going on. The website says no damage to any of their resorts but the power is out ergo they're lying. At this moment all we've been told is no damage apart from the power.
How is the royal suites turquesa hotel? I'm ariving Sept 30th.
"RST is fine. Some palapa damage, palm tree fronds. Beach was cleaned up yesterday. https:/…"
"Hi, does anyone have an update on the damage level of Dreams Palm Beach Punta Cana?we're due to arrive on the 30th and just want to check beforehand.thanks"
we fly out Tuesday to now larimar - good to hear not too much damage - what about rest of island - am I guessing trips and excursions etc may be limted?
"Can anybody tell me the condition of Iberostar Grand Hotel is, from the thread it doesn't sound like they are in good condition?"
"Good Morning,Any status updates on Chic Resort in Punta Cana. We are due to travel on Oct 1st?Thank you"
"I got an email from the Riu Republica last night and I'm feel reassured they said they have power, AC wifi, all restaurants and bars were 100% operational. They said the only damage they got was to gardens that should be cleaned up in the next day or two."
Looking for info on Melia Carib Tropical - the Level. No reference to Maria on their website - which is never a good sign! Due to arrive next week and hope that someone can provide some info on the conditions at the resort. Sending blessings to all in the DR.
"Than k you for the onfo, you are a life saver. I just got off the phone over at dreams resort and spa. You are right, everyone I gone, and no guests arriving"
"Even if Breathless itself is okay, I'm more concerned about the condition of the rest of the island and how it will affect beaches, excursions, etc. I can't seem to find much information about the damage to DR or Punta Cana in particular and how long it will be before things are cleaned up. Has anyone heard anything?"
"I , too would be interested in meeting at Dreams, much appreciate an update !"
"This thread is like watching a car crash . You don't want to keep reading but you can't help reading the same questions, ridiculous questions , over and over again. All you first time posters, should take the time to READ the thread , before asking your question. Jeez by post 500 or even less, anyone who can read could figure out what was going to happen, then after, the storm hit, and was gone by , after a few posts , could figure out, the storm didn't hit directly, some power out, some trees down, no major damage, and most if not all resorts, will be back to normal after a few days. Trips in friggen Oct, Nov, really by Monday should not be affected. Can't help but SMH , at the me in the moment mentality, now a days."
"Grand Palladium, GP Punta Cana, GP Palace, GP Bavaro, Royal Suites Turquesa: From Palladium Management Punta Cana ""The Hotel Management wishes to greet you and extend your most sincere thanks for following the instructions and warning information of hurricane MARÍA. In situations like the one experienced in the early hours of yesterday, the most important thing for us is the safety and well-being of our guests.Since the phenomenon has left our territory, the hotel team is working to be able to return to normal as soon as possible. We apologize for inconveniences that may arise yet. Please note that a large part of our staff is being reinstated to their jobs in service centers.We hope you continue to enjoy your stay with us and in case you need any information please go to our Public Relations or Stewardship desks.Thanks for your understanding."" webcam https:/…"
Any updates from the Iberostar Grand Bavaro would be kindly appreciated. Hope those of you in Punta Cana are safe and were able to enjoy your vacations!
"Hello, can someone post an update about Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort, Spa & Casino? Is it in working condition? Are pools and beaches useable? /or will they be useable in the nearest future/Are taxis from the airport operational?Thank you Miro"
"Thanks so much Kirsty! We really appreciate your response! Sunwing said we could continue as planned and in the event our resort has not opened, wed be redirected to a different hotel. We just can't have that uncertainty with 3 young kids. So thanks again!"
Carol97 I agree with your statement. ! I too keep coming back to the scene of the crime.

Any update on the Ocean Blue and Sand resort? No updates on their website yet.Edited: 2 years ago 
Any news on how the Melia Caribe resort made out -The Level adults side nearest the beach on Bavaro Beach? Still looks like hurricane warnings on that side of the island. Thanks!!
Has anyone heard anything about the Hard Rock. Arriving there on 09/24
"Joseph K,I'm scheduled for Chic the week after you so I'll be interested to hear about that place to. If at all possible post something yourself when you get there and assess"
Will do! Fingers crossed for good news.
"Hello,Any updated on the Paradisus Palma Real? Arriving Saturday."
"Felicia, in the thread someone says that the spa building at Dreams PC lost part of their roof, all guests were evacuated to Santo Domingo and that PC MIKE is unharmed , he just lost power. He's local ex pat a d will be back w updates...he has the truest updates. Airport is unharmed"
"Hi PC Mike,I sent emails to you ask about excursion but have not received your reply yet.Would you check and reply me?Thanks.GJ"
"On their facebook page they updated, stating that minor damage with a few trees down. They are in good shape. People there have commented that last night things were getting back to normal. The resort said they should be 100% by this weekend.."
"I was on Dreams Palm Resort and Spas Facebook looking for any updates. I asked one if there guests that had posted if there were any updates and how the resort had faired. At 7:30 this morning he had commented that they were doing well, the resort had 2 of their restaurants open, while the rest of the restaurants were closed. What concerns me?? Dreams deleted the post. It makes me nervous that they aren't informing there guest of their current situation but are taking the effort to delete guest posts on their wall.... Any updates from current guests would be greatly appreciated!"
"#1623 I'm all for ppl asking questions, as we have been told since little, there is no such thing as a stupid question. BUT, most if not all these questions have been answered over , and over again. If you found your way to the site, certainly you can figure out , that your supposed to read the thread. Now, because answers are not coming to ppl fast enough( although if they just go back a bit and read), they are starting new threads. That's what I mean about , me in the moment mentality."
"Good morning everyone! I found me some internet! LOLI do not have time to read back through all the posts right now, but can recap what I went through over the past 48 hours.Wednesday, we had a Pre Maria Rumfest at Steves Corner Bar until the police shut us down. It was blustery and some heavy squalls mixed in with some calm periods. About 6pm the power went off at home and I suspect almost everywhere except resorts (most have generators) as CEPM shut down for safety reasons.Winds started to increase around 9pm and strengthened out of the northwest as I had previously suspected. Peak winds came from 1130 to 2am and the winds shifted to the southwest. My thoughts of wind speed for the most part....tropical storm force with gusts into Cat 1 status (70+mph gusts). We did nothing to any of our windows and suffered no damage to any...even though our 2nd floor was totally exposed to the gusts. The girls all slept through it and I was up every 30 minutes to check everything...all good aside from a little water leaking under doors. For us (near the airport) very little rain in this storm.I woke at daybreak (6am) and got a better look at everything. We losts 4 roof tiles...2 of which found the roof of my Kia and the windshield of Carmen's Mazda. Aside from that...all was fine! I took a drive through our neighbourhood and there were some broken branches, but all in tact otherwise. At 730 I loaded up the girls and we drove to the airport. Some branches and signs down, but the airport was fine and was open. A few flights landed yesterday.Mid morning we loaded up for the grand tour. Signs down...trees broken and some typical areas of flooding. To my daughter's joy...Burger King was open at 11am!!!! Problem was...about a 30 minute wait for your Kid's Meal. We continued our drive up to the Hoyo de Friusa to see how my friends did in one of the most vulnerable areas. Well....to be honest...aside from a few signs and broken limbs...it looked normal! LOL There were 3 gas stations open as well.Miguel at the local colmado told me that all around the school was fine and most who lived in tin shacks spent the night at the church next to the school. The school is fine. The barrio was alive with people.We returned home and no power or internet in the afternoon. It finally came on this morning at 330am. I quickly turned on the hot water tank so at the worst, I could have a luke warm shower! Yesterday afternoon I put all the plants back where they belong, as well as the motorcycles and anything else. The girls played and roller skated.I did have some friends send pictures of Cortecito and other parts of Las Corales and as I expected, there was significant damage to the old beach shacks. This was inevidible as they were already parked at the high tide mark.No reports in from the resorts, but as I had earlier thought, there should be some downed trees, broken branches and issues on the beach. I will leave that up to people at the resorts. All of this can be quickly cleaned up. In a couple days you would not know anything happened. Today, businesses are reopening and life is getting back to normal.All is well from my side of the street.CheersPuntaCanaMike"
Thank you so much! This information is so helpful.
Thanks PCMike.We are getting ready to head down next Thursday to Breathless for the first time
Any updates on the Bahia Principe Tarquesa?
Thanks so much for your post. I am glad no one was hurt and all is getting better now. It was a pleasure to read one post and get answers. Have a great day.
"Punta Cana Mike, you are the best for keeping us updated. Glad all is well!"
Thanks PC MIke. We are headed down on Friday Sept 29 to Majestic Elegance. So happy that our friends of the Dominican are okay.
Thomson now saying Sensatori has power. In short. Thomson has no idea what's going on.
PC Mike thank you!! Glad you are safe and thank you for all of the updates.If anyone knows what happened at the Dreams Punta Cana meeting yesterday PLEASE TELL!! I am hearing of a Spa roof being damaged. I also emailed guest relations at the hotel yesterday and they wrote me back to tell me that they were still assessing the damages and that the resort is closed. Didn't say how long. I don't have Facebook so I cant see any of those updates. I don't arrive until the 3rd but I just want to make sure I can still have my wedding there on the 7th.-A Very Worried Bride
Thanks PC Mike for the postings.Does anyone have any information re: Hard Rock Resort? I have been trying to contact them but getting busy tone.We will be arriving Sunday Oct 24th and wanted to know the status.Any update is appreciated.thanks in advance
Anything on Now Larimar?
"Everything I've read is the Larimar is in good shape, just some fallen branches and debris but should be fully operational today or tomorrow."
"Norma L ....someone posted on here earlier that Now Larimar was fine, no real damage, just some overturned beach palayas and some downed branches. You should have no issues."
Does any one have any information on Grand Bahia Principe Turquesa? Arriving next week with our 1.5 year old.
"Hi guys,Can someone advise om Grand Palladium as well as the state of the PUJ airport?We are meant to arrive tomorrow and so far Thomson says all is in order however our friends travelling (also tomorrow) with Neckemann had an update of some damage in the resorts and problems at the airport. Prompt response would be much appriciated."
It doesn't matter if it is 6 months. I didn't say a definite time frame. I said ALMOST. And the fact that it is 6 months is helping my point even more. I am pointing out to the people that ask why travel during hurricane season that in 6 MONTHS of course people from around the world are going to travel to this region. This place is not going to be deserted for the entire hurricane season.
Post 1640: a big group of us are going to dreams Punta Cana on Monday for a wedding. All we know is that there is damage and the assessor will be takinga look today or tomorrow to see what the damage is. They have been unable to take a look as the area has damage and were not able to have a look at the resort. We’ve been told by Thomas cook we may need to change hotels and that they have found one for us to go to if it is as damaged as they think it is. We won’t know until tomorrow whether we can go to dreams or have to go somewhere else.Will post once I know what’s going on.
Try hard rocks social media pages. Somewhere on this lonnnnnng thread someone posted their statement saying all was good.
Any updates on chic??????
Curious about any damage to Iberostar Bavaro Suites. Scheduled to arrive October 7th.
"FeliciaWe are lucky enough to travel a lot and one of our trips normally falls within the hurricane season at this time of the year and in fact this Tuesday we will be off to Mexico for 3 weeks. We are well aware of the consequences of booking during this time are as many others that travel during these months. We have been mostly lucky so far and have only been caught out twice. Once when Jeanne hit PC and another time when we had a tropical storm in Antigua very early in the seasonWhat we have seen on the last couple of weeks with these storms are people did not know it was the hurricane season or who either thought - ""well it will never happen to us"" and panic sets in when something does. Both times we felt very safe and were very well looked after. With the tropical storm in Antigua life was back to normal within 24 hours but with Jeanne it took around 3 days. Did it take the edge of our trip - yes. Did it spoil them and make us think of never travelling during the season again - NoPeople just need to do their research and be prepared"
I haven't seen anything on Chic yet but Joseph K (in an earlier post) was also asking becasue he is going down Oct 3. I'm still trolling this page too
"Martinez...the airport is fine and I expect that most resorts...at the worst have some cosmetic damage and landscaping damage. The roads are clear...today looks like last Friday morning as far as banks open, sores open....normal life.CheersPCMike"
"Tourists travel to this area in the hurricane season because prices are relatively low. There are plenty of other areas having much better weather at this time (Mediterranean, Aegean, Canaries for example) but these can be more expensive or aren't known about. The peak hurricane season is August to October. You would be very unlucky indeed to suffer a hurricane outside peak months. You are far more likely to suffer a hurricane in peak season than outside peak hurricane season. It's just probability. The clue is in the name ""hurricane season""."
I will take a drive out to Uvero Alto shortly and report back as to any issues...sound good?CheersPCMike
Good to read about the good news and did the secrets royal hotel get through it ok?
Hard rocks FB page says all is good. Cosmetic damage. Will be reopening pools and whatnot soon. Thank goodness all is well and everyone is safe. Can't wait to get there on the 1st!!
a little more then cosmetic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE-ETV4AcQw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHpJtQwhFCM
Thank you!
"""You would be very unlucky indeed to suffer a hurricane outside peak months. You are far more likely to suffer a hurricane in peak season than outside peak hurricane season""People also need to remember that you can get some freak weather at other times of the year like in early May this year when they had a lot of rain which caused flooding and damage to several properties and their beaches with some people having to be moved room or to nearby sister properties"
"Niagara_WineRoute...I must disagree what these videos you post show are pretty minor cosmetic damage. I would imagine these resorts will be perfectly cleaned up in 48 hours or so. As for the collapsed structures, which are the shops on the beach. I am not sure if you have been there before, but these shops are built on the sand literally a foot or two from the water. It is hardly surprising these were damaged. When I was there, the merchants told me it is not uncommon to rebuilt or repair these regularly due to wave damage."
"Hello, Is there any update on the Riu Bambu? We have rebooked our trip to go in November."
awesome!! thanks Mike been worried coming Oct 3rd special occasion........Barry
"Thank you RB21022005 ! I look forward to hearing back from you.If I get any news from the hotel or my wedding coordinator, I will definitely let everyone know as well."
Anyone at the Iberostar... can you see down the beach if the flea market was destroyed? We regularly communicate with a few there.. especially Misael bar and we can't get in touch with them. Thx
the shacks by the Iberostars were destroyed.... they are not even supposed to be there and they are mere feet from the shoreline... go to FB if you want to pics.
"Debinatore.. been checking on FB.. where exactly are you seeing these photos of the beach shops? They don't have a FB page..and, to add, doesn't matter that they're not supposed to be there. It's still someone's livelihood!"

Thank you Mike! I am seeing conflicting reports about the DR. I appreciate your boots on the ground info!
Someone needs to get PC Mike a Go Pro as he tours the area. He is truly boots on the ground do real reporting.....Cheers!!
Posts 1660-1661 have links to videos provided. It may be beneficial to some to follow those links as there are some videos showing damage ( from different resorts) provided on side bars.
Thanks Mike.
wahoowa I totally agree with you... Look for Iberostar Suiteshttps:/…
"Those asking, I posted an updates on the Grand Palladium hotels this morning. See post 1612"
Thank you Deb!!!
"Pc Mike, that would be amazing as chic still has no phone or internet and has not posted any updates! Lots of hear say from guest but no exact info from them!Edited: 2 years ago "
"Thank goodness that there appears to be no reports of injury to anyone. Does anyone have any information on The Paradisus Punta Cana? We are due to arrive on Tuesday for our first time in Dom Rep & were well aware of the risks of booking during hurricane season. We've been offered an option to change destination but I don't think that we will but would really appreciate any info on this particular hotel, just so that we know what to expect when we arrive."
"Thanks so much! There have been so many differing comments on CHIC and it's getting a little crazy! Anything from, it's just fine to being closed for 3 months."
"go to resort facebook pages for updated pics etc.and damages done at the resorts... people living inland in cement buildings fared much better than those closer to the shore, which is to be expected. Some areas were hit harder than others... which is also to be expected, just like at home when a wind storm comes through, some buildings take a topple and one right next to it takes a hard hit... just sayin.Some resorts will take much longer than 48 hours to have everything up and running... some resorts are closed til tomorrow for example.There's not one person on this thread that can speak to the condition of all the resorts... I keep saying it but facebook is your best bet for resort information or contact the resort via telephone or email."
Anyone on the forum staying at Ocean Blue & Sand? We arrive October 1st so curious how hard the resort was hit. Thx
"So...drove to macao and Uvero Alto.I am on the beach beside Breathless right now. As for the resorts in Uvero Alto...all looks good. On the beach there are some palapas that have to be put back in the sand and a few palms down, but I can say that the squallwe had earlier this year did far more to the resorts up here than Maria did...infact...the beach is better!Macao is the expected mess, but all are working today to be open tomorrow. For those of you who have come with me or Pat to bales....it is basically destroyed...but...the kitchen stayed together! LOL Mom offered me lunch! Hopefully by Sunday the roofs will be rebuilt and they will be back in business! Of yes...very inportant...the beer cooler did not move an inch!I will post some pics later on my facebook page.So...given what I have observed...in the most sensitive areas...we remained mainly intact and those arriving over the next week or so, will have to look hard around a resort to find the damages.Cheers....noe off for a rum!PCMike"
"Chic Punta Cana is down. They will not commit to a date they will be up and running per management. I'm currently stuck at one of the horrible sister resorts, Memories. I am ready to go. This is my honeymoon and Chic is refusing to let the travel agencies rebook us to better resorts. All of the Chic guests here are really upset and tired of the uneasiness."
Hi MikeThank you so much for the update. It's very much appreciate. Very happy to see everyone is safe and well.
"Hi PC MIke, glad you and your family are well with all the DR people and tourists.Hope to meet you in October where we are staying at Breathless."

My sister has been at the Royalton all week. She was on the third floor and had several inches of water that came in through the door into the room a little ways due to the intense wind. Yesterday there were areas on the complex with about a foot of water. Some palms down. This morning they are still getting rid of the water in the hallways of the first floor. The pools are dirty with debris and such.The specialty restaurants are closed because the roof caved in. The buffet restaurant is open. Plenty of food there.They are diligently trying to get everything back in order.
won't be at the oasis bar
So you think that Maria did that much damage to cancel all together and not just change the dates?
SadeThat does not sound good - what damage was done?
Hi PC MikeDo you know how the Cap Cana/Juanillo beach area is? Going to Secrets Cap Cana soon!
Regarding Dreams Punta Cana Resort and Spa: we booked our vacation with JetBlue Vacations. I just called them to check on the status of the hotel due to conflicting reports. They called over to Dreams and was told that they are open and receiving guests.Hope this helps for those wondering and I hope they are correct!!! :)Thanks PCMike for allllll the updates! I don't know what I would of done without you these past few weeks!

Has she said anything about memories splash right behind Her? Supposed to be going to memories splash on Thursday.
"The resort is saying that the pools, & rooms are all good. Some trees down & cosmetic damage. Travelling there tomorrow. I hope they are not lying. Haven't seen anything about Cap Cana in this thread. I will try to post after I get there."
Thank you for posting. We are due to travel there on the 30th.
Any word on Ocean Blue and sand resort in PCThanks
Hi we are at the Ocean Blue and it has been damaged quite a bit. If you can reschedule I would. The staff are working extremely hard to sort the resort out but it's still raining very heavy all day every day. Electric has been going off regularly and water has gone off a couple of times. Hope this helps.
"laurieSanctuary Cap Cana which also sits on Juanillo Beach posted this statement yesterday-------------------------------------------------------------------To all our guests and friends,Thank you very much for having us on your thoughts during hurricane Maria. Although this has been much more stronger than hurricane Irma, we are glad to inform that all our guests and staff are safe and the hotels have suffered very little damage, with a few trees down and water leaks in some specific areas.Today there will be more rain and winds, and we are expecting to be 100% operational by tomorrow. In the meantime, our maintenance team is working on clearing up the areas of any debris and fixing whatever situation that may have occurred during the hurricane. We are working very hard today on making this Caribbean paradise as welcoming and wonderful as it was before.Our hearts go to our sister islands that were affected by this phenomena. We are confident that the sun will rise in the Caribbean very soon.We appreciate your concern during this time, and we hope to see you soon in Cap Cana"

@Tracy P We are returning to Sensatori tomorrrow (Saturday).
"Regarding #1698JetBlue provided a phone number for them. Feel free to call if you like. Their number is 809-682-0404.When I called JetBlue yesterday, they couldn't reach anyone at Dreams. The phone kept ringing and ringing. Seeing how they actually reached someone today, I think that's a good sign.Edited: 2 years ago "
This is a news release from Playa saying that Dreams Punta Cana Spa will be closed for 3-4 days. It also mentions their other properties.https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/…
Does anyone have information on the Barcelo Bavero Palace?
Does anyone have any information on the Barcelo Bavaro Palace?
"Arriving 10-2-17, any damage at the Luxury Bahia Principe Esmeralda? Any updates would be appreciated."
"Sorry for my misinformation regarding Dreams Punta Cana. I called them directly and spoke to someone myself. They are closed today and definitely tomorrow. Their plan is to reopen Sunday, but things could change."
"Hi there, does anyone have an update on the damage level of Sunscape Bavaro Beach Punta Cana? We're supposed to fly tomorrow Sept.23rd. Just got a call from the travel agency - they offer to pospone, hotel is still recovering. Don't know what to do now.Thanks."
"Update from Dreams Palm Beach. We were kept in the theatre until 11am yesterday and allowed out with a warning to be careful. The hotel has suffered roof damage and quite a lot of branches and a few trees were down. All the pools were a mess. Only the buffet was open last night however they did open the lobby bar and it was a great night. The whole hotel seemed to come together for a drink. Walter, the general manager, was absolutely superb the whole time. He is a credit to AM resorts. So today they have been tidying up. Restaurants will be back open and so will the pools. The beach is a mess but that is to be expected. Anyone arriving today or tomorrow should have no fears or worries at all. Hope that helps. If my updates have helped anyone come and say hi at the preferred pool."
"Thank you so much for the updates, PCMike! Very glad all is well with you and your family and the locals considering the state of the events."
"Not seeing much given on now larimar, for all that are due to go there (I am Monday!) I spoke to the hotel today and she assured me all was running as normal all dedbris has been cleared, restauramrs bars pools all good to go Thanks"
"Hello,Does anyone have news about Memories Splash and the Royalton ?Thank youEdited: 2 years ago "
"Thanks Reg, can you tell me which roof(s) were damaged? I called Dreams about an hour ago, and they said everything was running at 100%. The pools and restaurants were open, and that other than some superficial damage, all was fine. Of course they didn't mention anything about the roof issues. So are all of the restaurants and pools open? Were any of the rooms damaged? What is the weather like there today? Sunny? Still raining? We don't arrive until Monday afternoon, so we are hoping that everything is back to normal by then. Thanks for your updates."
Just received an email from Dreams PC hotel. They said they will be fully operating by Sunday 9/24
I'm flying into Dreams Palm Beach on Tuesday and appreciate all of the updates Mike & Reg! Hoping to hear everything is open again within the next few days and the beach is getting cleaned up.
Can anybody give an update on the Iberostar Bavaro Suites
Youtube has a couple of videos on Iberostar Bavaro Suiteshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHpJtQwhFCMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh2zbboWGJ4Angie.
Looking for an update from Mrs1909 about Secrets Cap Cana. You have been my group's lifeline to the resort even though you didn't know it. Thanks to everyone giving any kind of feedback for those of us who are flying in the next week or so. I have appreciated all the comments and I am sure others have as well!Thanks to PCMike for the all of your updates! You are the glue of this thread:) Glad you and your family are all ok!Edited: 2 years ago 
Anyone staying at Grand Sirenis Aqua games? Wonder what their situation is? How sad this is for all that have been impacted by these storms.
Can anyone tell me how the Reserve at Paradise Palma Real Resort faired during the Hurricane? My family is going for the first time on Oct 7th. Thank you.
Any news on secrets royal?
Thank you Angie I saw them videos yesterday I'm wondering if anybody has updates on how the weather is and how fast they might clean that up
"So far so good at Secrets Cap Cana some tidying of leaves trees etc. still to be done but people working hard to get it right as soon as possible, we are be glad to be home! If you are arriving in the coming weeks worry not!"
Any Updates for Old San Juan Sheraton?
"I'm staying there Oct 7th and can't get any info, did you call and did they tell you there was damage and offer you another hotel? Any info you could give me would be appreciated.Dianne"
"Thank you, Mrs1909!! Some of our group comes Sunday, but my husband and I, and the rest of us are coming on Monday. How much longer will you be there? Glad to hear all is well! Really, I so appreciate your feedback!!"
Courtney... GO TO THE FB page :-)
Any news from the Majestic Mirage? I have read a lot of posts but there are a ton to get through.
Iberostar Bavaro facebook link... https:/…
How is the weather there?
Where on the Facebook page? I found nothing just others asking similar questions
What shape is Now Larimar in? I am slated to go in a few weeks.
"Re Majestic Mirage: Beach is closed because they're still cleaning it. Pools may be open later today or tomorrow because they put the pool furniture back in place and are cleaning the pools. The Seaside restaurant on the beach is closed but most of the other restaurants are open. Most of the damage was fallen tree branches, landscaping needs to be cleaned up, some shingles off of roofs, etc. The bars are open except for the swim up bars and bar on the beach. I'm sitting in the lobby sipping a mojito now. No damage to the lobby. No damage in my room. We had a swim up suite and didn't need to move to another floor. There was no damage or flooding in my room. I can't speak for all rooms though. This is my last day here and I'm going to make the most of it. I feel very blessed because it could have been much worse. We went to the Majestic Elegance in April 2016 and the weather was beautiful. Maybe that's the best time to visit."
We will be arriving at that same resort on October 3rd and I'm curious is there is any damage to the resort as well!
"We lost electricity, water supply and wifi here at Breathless since this morning. So no showers today... people are gathering around the pool. Beach are is still closed but doesnt look that bad. We are also not allowed to go over to Now Onyx and some children can be seen here at adult area. So i guess they must have been hit harder than us. Weather is ok, cloudy and very windy. But only short rainfalls from time to time."
I shouldnt have written that. Just now it starts to rain heavily first time today. At least finally we can get a shower today...
#1739 Thank you for your update regarding Breathless Resort. I have been waiting for someone to post regarding electricity outage and no water. Continue updating us regarding the power outage hopefully things will get back to normal quickly so you can enjoy.
Thanks all for the updates. I noticed there is no info regarding The Level @ Melia Caribe. The hotel is not taking phone calls either.Any info would be greatThanks
"I haven't seen any info on Luxery Bahai Esmerelda, hopefully there was no damage to it, but would liketo hear from someone who is there now, as I will be vacationing there in a few days. Thank you for keeping us posted and informed."
Thanks a ton I have stayed at the majestic colonial for a friends wedding a few years back the mirage was an easy choice based on what I experienced there.
"we're arriving oct 3rd also. ...but going back to majestic elegance. By what I've read, Majestic properties are fine. some shingles lost,,,lots of property cleanup being done. I actually picked up our tickets from our travel agent this morning. Can't wait! p.s. You can check out Majestic Elegance Facebook page and see some pics and video that people have posted post Maria. On that page is also a notice from Majestic Resorts....saying basically everything is fine. Enjoy your vacation in paradise!"
Does anyone know anything about Catalonia Royal Bavaro.. scheduled to fly out tomorrow but can't get any information as to whether they have power or damage. Trying to make a decision whether to postpone..
Spoke with Melia this morning. Level Adults only is unavailable and one restaurant closed. Everything else is good.
"That's the spirit Michael H. When given lemons, make lemonade.....and add some tequila"
Hi all! Ive been reading the messages daily and still no news on Grand Bahia Principe Turquesa... Has anyone heard anything about that hotel?? Ive only seen a couple ask about it but no answer yet.Their Facebook has no info either.Thanks!
Cheers PCMike for your update on Uvero Alto. For our upcoming trip to Niw Onyx.Your hard work is very much appreciated.
https://m.facebook.com/story.php…From Catalonia
Can someone update me on Zoetry please? I know they evacuated guests but I'd like to know the extent of the damage etc. No updates on their pages so assume electricity is out.
Have you seen any update on what the dreams hotel condition is like? We are due to fly out Sunday? x
Thanks!
Just let you know Thompson through this hurricane have been an absolute disgrace out here with a lack of information to local reps regarding flights out people being relocated back to original bookings after being evacuated to Punta Cana never use Thompson again appalling customer service in this crisis should be ashamed the way they abandoned people.
"Hi Jennifer, we go home on Thursday 28th, it's a bit windy here today but warm and dry, the sun is out and we are all enjoying the pool bar! Nothing to worry about with Secrets Cap Cana at all, it's great to be back!"
"I agree that Thomson has terrible customer service. Nearly a year ago the hotel that I frequent issued announcements on its Punta Cana & Riviera Maya locations relative to renovations. Thomson's MO was to tell guests just before departure about ""minor renovations"" thus not allowing guests the time to change locations. This has happened over and over again so it appears to their pattern of behavior to deep guests ""in the dark"""
Update from Excellence El Carmen. Clean up operation continues and they plan to have the main pool and beach open tomorrow (Saturday) They were also putting furniture back out at Oregano and the Lobster House so expecting them open too.A quick look at the beach at 3pm suggests they have a lot to do by then. You should expect it to be operational rather than perfect. Swim-up rooms and private pools are still full of debris and I assume will be prioritised from Saturday/Sunday onwards. All protective boards now removed from windows. They even managed to put a show on in the Main Theatre last night which was no mean fea.If there was a way we could gather all the staff together to thank them then we would!!
Does anyone have any info on Riu Bavaro?
"Hi,Do you have any more information about the level? We will come in 2 weeks and I start to worry from your massage.Tnx"
Things are getting back to normal a the Palladiumhttps:/…
"Hi, I called the Breathless Resort at 1:30pm today and the guest service person told me that everything was operating 100% as normal, interesting that he told me that if the power/water is out. I am arriving at Breathless tomorrow afternoon and staying thru Fri. Sept. 29th. Hope all is fixed by then!"
Is this the Melia Paradisus Palma Real that you are referring to? I saw a video on the website of the Paradisus Palma Real and it showed a lot of debris. Someone who worked at the hotel advised to delay my trip that's currently scheduled for Sunday.Does anyone else have any update on the condition of the Paradisus Palma Real Golf Resort & Spa by Melia?Thanks!!
Wifi is back now at Breathless. But until 30 mins ago it was definitely not working. I dont know if electricity and water also work now again since im at poolside. But i guess hotel management didnt want to alarm potential guests.
I refer to The level at melia caribe - the adults only.Anyone knows what the damage overthere?
Did they say how long the Level Adults only will be unavailable??
"1764 - I can understand that they don't want to alarm guests coming in, I just hope that all is good when I arrive and I am sure it will still be a fun time! Looking forward to it! :)"
"Wondering about Chic, any updates?We are expected to leave on 10/3. First time traveling to DR."
Punta Cana looks pretty bad but the Riu Republica is cleaned up and functioning properly.
Wish we could have all of PC Mike's updates at the beginning of the forums! Amazing! PC Mike for president! You have my vote! Thanks for doing all the leg work.
Thank you! will be there in a couple weeks. Been waiting on a DPB update!
"Air Transat just cancelled our flight tomorrow siting security concerns. We were headed to Excellence for our honeymoon. I'm not happy with the timing of this decision by air transat because it leaves us with no alternatives and traveling at another time is going to be difficult. Given what the resorts are saying and especially PC Mike, I'm questioning this decision by air transat."
Electricity and water are still not working at Breathless. Wifi is also gone again. It only worked for a short time. I hope they can fix it soon.
"Mrs1909, thanks for the weather update! You are amazing! Glad you all are enjoying the sun, warmth, and especially the pool bar!! That is our group's favorite spot at any all inclusive resort:) We will be there Monday afternoon, I hope to meet you before you head home!!"
Thanks for updates on Breathless but has anybody got any news regarding damage to Now Onyx please?
Hello everyone! My parents are traveling to Punta Cana next Sunday to Majestic Elegance.This of you who are there now can give me an update? When the beaches and other areas will be back open? Was there a lot of damage? Examples please.My parents are worried to not go and lose all that money.Any live current updates would be appreciated.Thank youTasha
"Despite the fact that Sunwing Canada had stated that flights to Punta Cana would be back up and running starting tomorrow, they have just announced that they are suspending all flights to Punta Cana until MONDAY 25th now. We were luckily able to get hold of a sales rep quickly on the phone and have been rebooked to Mexico Puerto Vallarta, leaving Sunday. Suggest you keep an eye on your airline's website for similar last minute changes to flight schedules."
Anyone know if Breathless had any damage?
1776 & 1778: there are numerous updates from today on both of the hotels. You only need to read back a few pages!
"#1772 James.Westjet did the same thing for our Saturday Sept 9th flight to Dreams La Romana after Irma. Due to the reports of very little damage I was more than upset. This was a long awaited, long planned trip for my 60th birthday. We were able to re-schedule for Tues the 12th, but had to accept a change of resort, and then found out we would be evacuated home due to Maria on the 19th. Hopefully you can work with Air Transat and find a solution.Edited: 2 years ago "
#1776 i am going there tomorrow. Check their fb page looks fine to me
Which Dreams? Someone from this forum arrived there today and was transferred from Dreams PC to Dreams Palm Beach...
"Hi Kelly, I spoke to a lady who's there now and she told me that there is one pool open and one restaurant. The staff is cleaning and fixing everything and everything should be normal after the weekend. I'm flying on monday, so lets hope for a lot of sunshine!"
"For everyone who is staying at the bahia principle hotels & resorts head to their FB page they have posted all the info on there regarding damage to the resort & it looks like it is just superficial damage that will be sorted in a few days, think the beaches are a bit if a mess."
Any news on catalonia bavaro beach and golf resort? Wedding is soon there! Thank you!
@107lindsay - there's an active thread on the catalonia royal bavaro:https:/…86468301
Breathless is getting evacuated because of lack of electricity. We will all be brought to Secrets Royal Beach Resort in Bavaro.Edited: 2 years ago 
"DREAMS Palm Beach is fully open and they are well into the cleanup. I checked in today (after a few days stay in Santo Domingo) and they were taking down all the protective boards, cleaning up the gardens, cleaning the pool and clearing the beaches today. All restaurants are going to be open today. Does not appear to be any damage to the buildings, just tree damage and debris. The only other thing it the cable TV is not working at the resort. I would except the resort to be close to perfect in the next couple of days."
https://m.facebook.com/story.php…From Hard Rock
"Catalonia Royal Bavaro is working perfectly! The garden is being cleaned (it was a bit damaged: palm tree leaves on the grass all around) but the main pools are all working, the bars, beach is opened, power, wifi, air conditioning. Everything is just fine. The only thing is the road has some water still and the gardens a bit damaged. That is ALL!"
"Fernando the main pool is open but the infinity pool is not . There's no al a cartes open . Yes wifi and power on , as for aircon not all , I've been moved as a lot are having to be ."
We were scheduled to arrive at Breathless Punta Cana tomorrow morning and just found out that they are closing the hotel until the 29th can anybody confirm this?
Has anyone heard about the Grand Sirenis resort at all?
"""just found out that they are closing the hotel until the 29th can anybody confirm this?""You found out how? You don't trust the source? Call the hotel. They have toll-free numbers."
Just got in touch with Breathless they are closed until the 29th.
Thanks for the update on Excellence El Carmen. We are to arrive Thursday the 28th. and have been reading all the threads daily. We are booked into a swim up room and had wondered if they were being used and were operational as swim ups or would be able to be by our arrival time. I know that some resorts post electrical problems but seems like none at Excellence? Thanks also to PC Mike for all your valuable reporting .
"Does anyone have any info on secrets cap cana arriving Wednesday but I still have a chance to cancel up to tomorrow but we really want to be there, so any info would be greatly appreciated. Thank youEdited: 2 years ago "
This is a different resort than the catalonia beach and golf resort. Thank you though
"Does any one have any info on secrets royal beach resort? I called and they did say their resorts weren't affected, yet I'm seeing that secrets cap cana isn't doing great. Supposed to head out Monday for my honeymoon buy I'd risk losing money to reschedule if it's a mess."
Please let me know how secrets royal Is! Been trying to get the real answer all week!Edited: 2 years ago 
Any News on Barcelo Bavaro Palace to the damage and are they operating?
"Hi, Thanks for your post. I am so sorry for you. Me and my husband are traveling to Chic for our anniversary Monday, 9/25. I called a moment ago and was told the hotel is open. Any updates that you can provide is appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
Does anyone have any updates on Chic?Edited: 2 years ago 
All guests from Breathless and Now Onyx have just been transferred to Secrets Royal Beach and Now Larimar. We will stay here now. I got checked in here until October 9th. So i probably wont go back to Breathless. It was dark when we arrived but there doesnt seem too much damage here. And the hotel quality looks pretty much the same. Im just worried that it might be hard to grab a sunbed tomorrow since some might have been broken and now the hotel here might be rather full of people. But then again lets first hope that sunshine will return and we can get back to a regular beach vacation now.
I'll be flying on the 27th to majestic elegance. Please keep me update if everything is fine over there. Thanks a lot!Edited: 2 years ago 
"Thank you for the update! There isn't much info on the net, so your comments are very helpful."
Been inform by Thompson we might be going back to Cayo Levantado on Monday but going by previous updates we don't believe a word i can't criticise them enough absolute disgrace calling themselves a tour operator never again ruined our holiday with their neglect & abandonment shameful
From all of my experience with Thomson clients Thomson is disgraceful. No communication and if they do communicate it's often not honest. I hope you sort this out.
"We are at Grand Bahia Principe Esmeralda. Everything back to normal, pools, restaurants, etc open. Some minor clean up left. Staff have been absolutely amazing through the hurricane situation. Calm, quick, responsive. We all got to stay in our rooms, and by next morning enjoyed the buffet and lobby bar. Weather cleared up by mid day today - got to enjoy the pool bar. Greatfull to have stayed at a resort as good as this one after hearing about experiences of others being moved between hotels etc."
Clean up proving a bit more challenging at Excellence El Carmen as they advise main pool and beach now closed till Sunday.Resort seems quiet as our American cousins stay away? Just had a great night with great food and a variety of entertainment. Well done EEC!
"Our friends finally sent us pics and vids from the flea market down from the Iberostar. Totally destroyed. We love sitting at Misael bar drinking 20 oz presidentes, playing my music from my Spotify collection, dancing and watching the people go by. Those people have become pals and part of our famiglia! Gonna take a while to rebuild. We'll be back in January so hope they do.... stay safe everyone"
http://www.amresorts.com/inclement-weather breathless the hotel say its fine and resumed as normal?Edited: 2 years ago 
Very pleased to hear PC Mike and family are okay. His posts were so informative and as a mother with a daughter in Punta Canta his posts were invaluable. I am very relieved to see from other posts that your beautiful island has not had as much devastation as l was expecting. To all the residents of Domican Republic l wish you well.
Hi To anyone with correct information.We are travelling to the Royalton on Thursday 28th.Thompsons have put on their travel information that they are contacting people staying at the Royalton and Chic that are traveling up to Tuesday 26thThis suggests to me these two hotels have problems and apart from a post stating that rain water was coming under the doors there is not really a great deal of information about these two hotels.There probably is something somewhere but theres that many posts it would take hours to scroll through them all.does anyone have up to date information ref these two hotels or is there anyone there now that couls ease our worries it being so close to travelling.Thanks Dece
"dece,Post #1684 mentions Chic so I guess it is the same for Royaltonhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147…Angie."
"We arrived yesterday at the royal caribe tropical just for one night until we go to the sensatori today when it re opens. When we arrived there were 26People all leaving from complaints about the hotel, they were being moved to the Riu. Thy originally were staying at the royalton but got moved due to the flooding. I have seen videos and pictures, if I was coming over I wouldn't want to be going there the hotel looked badly damaged. We were speaking to a couple who have cut there holiday short, they were saying they were in lockdown for 24 hours and there were rivers coming through the hotel rooms even on the first floor bedrooms"
"Majestic Mirage's beach is almost completely cleaned. It's no longer closed off. They used a bulldozer to clean debris. They still have to put all of the Bali beds and Tiki huts back in place but that shouldn't take long. I walked along the beach yesterday. We had a great dinner at the steakhouse so the restaurants are open. There was also a ""Disco Nights"" show at the theater last night."
Great to hear life is getting back to normal
"Good Morning everyoneI have been religiously reading all posts and want to thank everyone for posting updates it is really appreciated.We are going to Sunscape Bavaro Beach on the 30th.The only post I have read regarding this hotel was #1713, and I don't believe there was an answer.If anyone knows or has any info on Sunscape I would appreciate it.Thank you all for your time :)Kim"
Kim see 1812. Sunscape resorts are part of the AM group.
"If any of you have snapchat there is a snapchat map where people post there snaps from there area they are at. On the map you can zoom in on punta cana, even the hotel you will be staying at. I've been looking everyday at it. I'm due to stay at Ocean Blue and Sand in a couple of weeks. There was someone in this tread around page 171 that said they had intermittent power and water. I'm keeping an eye out because I do not want to go if there is damage."
"A littlle weather FYI.I was looking at the PUJ (Punta Cana ) METAR (weather info) for last week. This is the weather provided to pilots and considered to be officialMaximum wind gust was 66mph...avg wind speed was 40mph.7.8 inches of rain fell over the 24 hour period.As the area of Punta Cana is large, there can be some variance to those numbers , thus lets consider +/- 10% as a variationThere was a comment earlier about those living in concrete houses (directed at me no doubt) not suffering damages. In my drive through the countryside, barios and and small villages like Macao and El Seibo , where the average house is palm bark and a tin roof, most houses clearly appeared intact. Those that had issues...the issues were minor.Of course the beloved beach shacks took a beating, but most were parked on the regular high tide mark.It was just a matter of time before the sea would claim them.Over the next few days, each resort will work hard to get back to normal. It actually is not a huge job as some seem to think...mainly brush removal and beach rehab (put the palapas back in the sand).One thing I would like to say about the local authorities. They did an outstanding job of making sure roads were clear. There were crews out removing limbs (trees...lol) and other debris. The power company (CEPM) had lights on for everyone within a day of the storm. This morning we have gray skies with rumbles of thunder and a light rain. Hopefully that will subside later this morning and we can get a round of golf in.CheersPCMike"
Thank you krboyle :)Kim
Hopefully they will not have too much rain as it seems the resorts that are suffering the most have enough water damage as it isEdited: 2 years ago 
Any updates Ambar Blue please can't find ny information on this thread.cheers.
Does anyone know anything about the Melia Caribe
"Hey PC Mike, I have an insight question for yah. So most have power back up now. But, CHIC still doesn't even have phone lines up. Is this normal? Does this mean one can assume they may have been damaged a little more than most? I am just trying to make a little sense of it all. The Royalton company seems a bit unreliable when it comes to getting any information from them. They just keep saying oh the the hotel is back up and running. But, it is most certainly not haha! Thanks, Katherine."
"Yes, still some resorts are closed or not ready for new guests and cancelled flights because of it as they would have no where to put the guests and don't want to fly with half empty planes, and will be more cancelled flights from airlines til certain resorts are up and running and the rooms allocated to them are ready to go... some resorts sustained more water damage to the rooms than others, pools had to be drained, cleaned and filled up again, some palms fell, some palms fell onto resort buildings/structures and need to be stabilized obviously for safety reasons... and is taking a longer than originally thought to ""clean up""."
we are leaving on the 29th and staying at Presidental Suites by lifestyles which is close to Sunscape. Ive been searching for info and have found nothing.
"Hello,I am flying int Monday staying at the Riu Republica does anyone have any more information on RiuThanksMark"
"For ocean blue and sand, if you have facebook, there are two places to look for updates.. one from ocean blue and sand and another amigos of ocean blue and sand.. the hotel and people there have posted that they are back up and running and should be 100% soon.. I am also arriving on oct 1st and I am not worried based on facebook posts, videos and pictures I have seen... good luck to us, but I think we should be fine by next week"
"Thanks for update on majestic mirage, is there a lot of seaweed on beach today? Did punta cana lose a lot of palm trees? We are coming down in October"
"Carla the FB page says from current guests they lost a lot of palapas from the beach,, there's other pics regarding the palms.Edited: 2 years ago "
Great to hear Elena N #1809. I really appreciate your post as we'll be there very soon! How is the damage to the beach area? I'm assuming the seaweed situation is worse? Thank you for the info.Enjoy!!Edited: 2 years ago 
"We just got into the Riu Republica yesterday. Minimal damage on the property, they have cleaned it up fast. One pool is down but not sure if it is because of the weather. It stormed last night and light rain this morning but it looks like it's going to break for a while. Hope this helps."
Webcam at Palladium beach (Bavaro)https:/…
Does anybody know if PC Mike is okay haven't seen anything from him in a while
CortneyHe post earlier - see Post #1822
"These updates are not accurate!!! We returned to Sunscape Bavaro last night and although the main reception and buffet are back up and running, there are still plenty of problems. Most of the damage was to the trees which is still to be cleaned up. With the continuing rainfall most of the pathways are flooded, there is very little outside lighting at night which is making it treacherous to walk to and from the room. The main pool area and beach are out of bounds. A lot of the rooms on the ground floor were flooded but they still tried putting guests in them last night. We are now being told there are no other rooms available. We are here now until next Tuesday and feel our only option is to sit it out. We have had no help from Thomson."
"Yes the hotel is a dive, I wouldn't let my dogs stay here"
Seems like AMResorts need to update thishttp://www.amresorts.com/inclement-weather
How is the resort now that Miria has past? Please let me nothanks
"Join the Chic Punta Cana travelers FB group. It's pretty scary in there but from what I can read between the lines is guest have not returned, it's possible early next week. So far Royalton and Chic have not made any official announcement so it's all gossip among the group there"
"""How is the resort now that Miria has past? Please let me nothanks""Which resort and have you checked out the last few pages of this thread?"
Anyone know how the Luxury Bahia Principe Esmeralda made out from Maria ????? or the other Bahia Principes ????? ... I don't see anything on their main web page or facebook page !!!!!! Glad to hear that overall the damage has not been too extensive .
"Does anybody have any updates on Breathless? Have read on here that they are closed and have not been able to get in contact with them at all, however my travel agent has told me that everything is up and running. Supposed to fly in tomorrow morning, however these conflicting reports are alarming. Any help is greatly appreciated!"
Breathless has been evacuated. Not sure when they will reopen. Somebody mentioned 29th. Better prepare to go to Now Larimar or maybe Secrets Royal Beach. Those are the hotels they brought all of us Breathless refugees. I hope you bring some good weather here. :)
We have been going to Punta Cana for the past 10 years and have mostly booked in the fall due to the great discount prices. This is the first year we ever had to worry about hurricanes. Hurricane season is from July to November so you never know and you take a chance. And it's always been worth it.
"Yes. We had the same question as we are going next week. Finally got some information from someone besides the hotel who is staying there. Go to you tube and type Bahia Esmeralda hurricane Maria. There are 3 short videos ""beach damage"", ""after hurricane"", ""per special request"". Best kind of information is from a current guest and he was nice enough to post these. Hope this helps you."
AndyWill... your travel agent said that???
"Yes. Breathless finally got back to me as well. They said that all guests were evacuated and that guests arriving today will be placed in other resorts, and starting Sunday Breathless will begin taking in arriving guests again."
See link below in regards to Breathless and other AMResort propertieshttp://www.amresorts.com/inclement-weather
"Right now all of El Cortecito, is under water because the streets are flooded. It is still raining on & off so there has not been a chance for water to drain away. I own a penthouse at PS and as it faces the ocean on both sides, I got slammed hard. I'm disabled so I will have to wait until my attendant shows up to work on Monday to check out rooftop patio. Power and water is back on. You do know that these are mostly all 2 & 3 bedroom condos right and not a huge resort. It's was supposed to be residential so it's smaller but that means more personalized for you, I hope. I live here so I don't avail myself of many of the services but I get along great with the Lifestyle group. One thousand t I miss better than last bunch who managed! I will try to update you with pics later Monday. Jaxs"
"Hi 1829, I've replied to you. See my answer at 1853. Good luck. I would think by 29th, all should be cleaned up but I will keep you posted until I leave for home."
Anyone have any updates on Excellence El Carmen in Punta Cana? Even if resort is okay what about overall safety on island due to damage and resource shortages elsewhere?Edited: 2 years ago 
I haven’t seen anything posted about the Barceló Bavaro Palace. We’re coming down the end of October. Anyone staying there or close to there? Give any info about that resort? Thanks.
"""Anyone have any updates on Excellence El Carmen in Punta Cana? Even if resort is okay what about overall safety on island due to damage and resource shortages elsewhere?""There are posts in this thread about EEC and the area in generalEEC are also posting updates on their Facebook page"
There was a post from Guest Relations yesterday saying the Barcelo had no damage.
"Hello, we are on the same flight! We're staying in dreams resort and spa, called all week and they haven't been helpful at all! Just saying they will call back on Monday. Have you heard anything x"

"""If anyone has anyone is staying at Dreams resort and spa and has any more information whether it's damaged, please get in touch""Did you read my reply in Post #1861"
Just got to Majestic Elgance . Looks good. No big damages. Delta start flying from NY to PUJ since Thursday
Hope you are safe and okay. And thank you for answering. The Punta Cana princess suites are residential? Was not aware of it if this is the same property. We were told they were 1 bedroom suites.
Latest from Excellence El Carmen. They have got about half the beach back open and a few guests are on it. Final work being done on main pool but parallel pool next to it is drained and full of rubbish right now. Lobster house opened at lunchtime but Oregano remains closed because of broken/shattered/missing glass panels. For the same reason it looks like X Lounge could be out of action for a while as they have missing glass panels so it's not safe. Resort is very quiet.
"i can tell u first hand the iberostar bavaro was heavily damaged.i returned last night and was at the resort for the hurricane.very sad as i have been going there for ten years.if u have a trip planned i urge you to cancel.i was so upset seeing the damage hurricane maria did to the beach, pool area, and the groundsvery sad"
Please do update. I am planning to go to the resort on Sept 30.
"Jennifer L glad I could help I know we were worried back at home unsure what the resort would be like after Irma and these forums really helped, you should be able to identify hubby and I at the pool bar so far we are the only ones from England :-)"
What was damaged Scott...heavily damaged is a broad word. Could you be specific?
"I couldn't see what it says about Dreams spa and resort, just the other Dreams hotels? Could you tell me more?"
"Thanks for updates during Irma. Trying to follow along but @ 2,000 posts. Do u have any info on Princess all suites Bavaro? Supposed to go in @ a week. It will be our 5th time to the DR and just breaks my heart bc we love it there"
Well arrived yesterday with Thomson from Gatwick to Secrets at Royal Beach Punta Cana. Very very minimal damage here. Just got back from the beach. Bit cloudy but very warm. No need to worry if you coming here everybody. Come on down. Ken Mackenzie.
"The Dreams Resorts website is now updated and states Dreams Punta Cana resort is closed through October 8. Guests are being relocated to Dreams La Romana, Dreams Palm Beach and Now Larimer. Guests will be brought back to Dreams Punta Cana Resort on October 9 and forward."
anyone know how puerta plata made out with hurricane maria
@Sparty89 can you share the link where you saw the info about Dreams Punta Cana being closed?
Try this link:dreamsresorts.com/content/site/amr/dreamsres…
"According to the Facebook Page for the Iberostar Dominicana, they are back up and running since Friday afternoon. They are right next door to the Iberostar Bavaro....not sure what Scott means by ""heavily damaged"".Its pretty much business as usual at both the Iberostar Punta Cana and Dominicana."
Is there someone who is accomodated in Bavaro Princess resort? Is it working in normal state?
"Did you go on your trip? If so I hope your well. I have a trip coming up on Oct 2, 2017."
"Did you go and if so which resort are you staying in? I have a trip on Oct 2, 2017 and I am curious."
"Hi Jen, I’ve looked everywhere online and all these posts, and nothing about the Barceló Bavaro palace. I’m not canceling, due to having this planned for a long time now. And it’s still 5 weeks away. I just hope all is well."
I saw something that Barcelo was fine. Let me look.

Can anyone tell me about Breathless Resort and Spa on Punta Cana. I'm supposed to arrive on Wednesday 9/27. Should I reschedule?
"I arrive Oct 1 from Canada, looking for an update on CHIC, cannot reach by phone or email, no updates on any social media or website. Can someone help?Edited: 2 years ago "
"ABOUT CHIC RESORT: Further back on the forum, on the 21st? The day after the hurricane one girl said that they relocated guests to the Memories or something and did not have a date on when they would open back up. She said that they would not give an exact date. But if you are going on the 1st, that would be aprox 9 days after ... I would keep calling every single day OR call a neighboring resort next door and ask them ... ???Edited: 2 years ago "
"About CHIC RESORT: Further back on the forum, I believe on the 21st or so ...?

She was there for her honeymoon... maybe you can direct message her and ask her what is going on. :)"
"1815, 1814, 1817 and 1824 all have info on CHIC RESORT. There is more, you just have to look and ""CRTL F"" for it. That was the easiest way. :)"
"I have been calling CHIC as well to no avail, I haven't gotten any response. I've stalked all of their social media outlets and they haven't posted anything. Crossing my fingers for the people who will be joining me at CHIC hopefully next Wednesday."
"Hi, did you guys get moved back to the hotel and is everything back up and running at CHIC? Anything you can provide will be helpful."
"Suzanne, do you know anything about damage done to Breathless. I'm supposed to arrive on the 27th and am considering rescheduling"
Should be fine by Monday. Heard from Breathless that all should be fine by Monday.
Lynnedtaylor -I called the Now Resorts main line and they called the Now Onyx manager and she said everything back to normal Tuesday and Breathless is directly next to Onyx I would guess that they will BOTH be fine Bc they are basically the same resort. Hope this helps ! If you go to NowResort.com and call the main number they will prob confirm that as well
"annon... what do you mean you ""heard"" from Breathless????"
I'm currently at Barcelo Bavaro Palace and the resort is doing fine and in very good condition.
Thank you for the update on Barceló Bavaro Palace. I did not want to cancel my trip.
"Update about Breathless: we will be back on Sunday- the electrycity problem have been solve. We got a message via messeneger and in the evning we recieved a official note to our room at Secret Royal Beach. By the way- this is supposed to be a higher rank but honestly i don't know why. The hotel is old and is very different then Breathless, don't have such a unique party and modern climat. We in the Preffered Club ( the most expensive type of stay) but besides the butler and concierge we don't see a much different. It's definietly not worth of any more money. Toomorow we can share some information about Breathles but i am sure there is no bigger damage there."
"Received an email from CHIC informing that they are working on fixing the problems. No details on when the hotel will start accepting new guests, assuming it will take several more days, at least."
Paula... was everyone outted from Breathless?
https://m.facebook.com/story.php…Nickelodeon / Sensatori
Excellence El Carmen now state on Facebook that normal operations will be up and running from Monday. Gin in meantime has tasted very good.
"I'm booked 10 months ago, to go on the 15th October with my 3 sons our first big holiday and to be honest I don't want to go, I feel it's been tarnished and all the media doesn't help. I'm sorry for the areas that had been the most devastating"
YasminWhich resort are you staying at?
"Does anyone know what state the Grand Palladium is in? How are they coping?Also are the day trips stil on? E.g jungle tours, samona island etc?"
Hi there is a Facebook page for the grand Palladium palace spa and casino it give yous all updates etc. As far as i can see and have read there isn't any damage to worry about we fly out there on the 5th Oct. You can see live feeds of the beach and round the different hotels etc. Hope this helps :)
"@Debinatore- yes, everyone from the Breathless and Now Onyx. There was a huge electricity problem in the Uvero Alto area and the hotel is too big for using a power generator. This is what our concierge said in Secret Royal Beach. But the problem is fixed now, they are going to pick up us around 3 PM.Edited: 2 years ago "
Milnsey...... could you send me the link as I can't find it for some reason :)Thanks!
"Info on National Hurricane Center website: ""Lee continues to rapidly intensify"". Is anyone concerned about that? Any information on Lee's projected path?"

"Currently at Gran Bahia Principe Fantasia and all is good. Came in yesterday around 5pm . Very smooth going from airport to hotel. Everything is operational and looks fine, there might even be sun today. Will check out the beach today and report back."

any update on majestic mirage?
"Yesterday afternoon I went to Bibiagua, This is located between the Barcelo Bavaro and IFA resorts.All I could say was....WOW!!!The beach is better than I can every remember! Wide and flat. There was no damage to the vendora market...most were open like it was just another day. Loads of loungers on the beach at IFA. Walked up to Melia. I could see from there that all looked good all the way up to Los Corales. Very little sargassum. As I said...the beach looks much better at the south end of the stretch as well as in Uvero Alto. Sometimes there is a benefit to a storm!As of late yesterday afternoon, there were still some powerlines down around Sunscape (Cortecito)...if anyone has seen some of the bird""s nests of powerlines here...it is amazing that it took a storm to bring the lines down....it was a mess of wire to start with!Someone yesterday mentioned that Cortecito was under water. Well...lets say that was a bit of an exaggeration. There is the area in front of Now Larimar that was flooded (it always does with just an hour of rain) and a low area near what we call Little Haiti, just south of the Palladium wall. Both areas are the low point of what used to be a mangrove lagoon, before developers filled it in and as a result...the waters sit for a few days...having nowhere to go. Aside from a random shallow puddle, the rest of Cortecito is dry. I drove each street yesterday...no issues.Government and civilian volunteer work crews we busy south of the Palladium, cleaning up the sidewalks...looked great.Today...the sun is back! Time to fire up the Volusia and go for a ride!CheersPuntaCanaMike"
"Is there any update on Ocean Blue and Sand? We go on the 13th October with young children and I am concerned. Their face book page says all is fine, but I am reading about no electricity and other issues..."
When you get back to Breathless I'm interested in finding out how the rooms are after having no airconditioning for the past few days and the condition of the beach. If the beach is still closed how busy is the pool going to be! Any updates you can provide will be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.
35 mph winds and is miles north and continuing north in the atlantic ocean so not worried even in the slightest!
Majestic is fine...up and running.
"""the condition of the beach.""I was on the beach on Friday. It is better than I can ever remember . They should have the palapas up by now.Pic of Breathless Beach on my facebook page.CheersPCMike"
Hi Mike are all the trips running we are due to do the jungle safari next week?
Everyone who pays for electricity should have it since Friday. Ocean should be fine.CheersPCMike
reports of Breathless are very confusing... people here on TA as of yesterday and today and on FB report that they were shipped out to Secrets... people landing yesterday and today are still staying that when they land they are being told they have to go to Secrets and the reason they have been told is Breathless has no electricity and is closed.People are now reporting that they may return to Breathless at 3 pm today.
Milnsy...should be back to a regular schedule
"Hi PC Mike, no one has responded to me. Can you tell me if RIU Bambu is up and running. I am due to arrive on Tuesday:) Much appreciated. Thank you"
Hi can anybody give me an update on the weather in PC over the past few days? Has it been raining a lot?
@debinatore We are definietly coming back to Breathless at 3 pm today. I double checked today- with the Breathless on messenger and with my concierge in Secrets. Also we all recieved a note in our rooms that everything is fine and if we wish we can be back ( we could also stay in Secrets if we want it ) So stay calm and don't worry. As soon i will be in Breathless i will let you know. ☺️
"""Hi can anybody give me an update on the weather in PC over the past few days? Has it been raining a lot?""There are a couple of ""live from"" threads and many other posts from people who are at resorts just now which mention the weather post Maria passing by. It seems they have had a fair amount of rain but the last read it was brightening up"
@apaliszewski It was raining a lot in a past few days but today the weather is great- sunny and super hot! we have some clouds at the moment but this is perfectly normal. At the pool right now having a great time☺️
good to hear - thank you.
"Hi PC MikeWould greatly appreciate if you can update me on the resort Occidental. I am head out with my 2 boys this Monday sept 25, 2017. Just concern about the resort. It's our first family vacation. Thanking you in advance."
Thanks Paula... just keep hearing conflicting reports regarding Breathless as to whether or not it was closed up until today... even an expat said there were tourists there yesterday? I hadn't seen anyone there in pics or anyone reporting or posting pics from there answering questions in the last few days.... so I was believing what everyone has been saying... that is has been closed the last few days and people forced to stay at Secrets... thanks for the update.
"I imagine some of the resorts are saying all is fine and they are up and running but not disclosing the whole picture... understandably so and I get that.... but people want to know the whole truth and given the option of moving, resceduling etc. if they feel any of the ammenties or restaurants will be closed to them will affect ""their"" vacation."
Not finding any news on Royalton Punta Cana. Anybody know?
"Anyone have information on Ocean Blue & Sand Resort in Punta Cana? Our scheduled arrival is October 1st, any info you could provide would be appreciated. Thank you."
@PaulaMikulska thank you

@ debinatore I will give you an honest update today- you have my word. I was at the Breathless last year so i will definietly notice any damage or any other change that i don't like. Me and my husband are very focus on details so i can assure we will see if sth is wrong.

"Just arrived at Catalonia Royal Bavaro yesterday... road into resort had some water, clean up is still taking place of palm leaves down on outside of resort, infinity pool is closed as it is close to the beach. Not sure when it will be back open but the other big pool is open. The staff has been amazing so far. Weather is great right now!!"
"Hello everyone.I really need your help. We have a planned trip in a couple of days to the Memories Splash (behind the Royalton) with our 2 kids. We are trying to get some information about the state of the water park. We assume that the hotel is in good condition but we are worried about the water park. These are plastic tubes that probably had a hard life during Maria hurricane . We want to know the state of the water park. PC Mike, we need you! You are great everyone to keep us informed!

"My parents arrived to Punta Cana yesterday and they told me Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort in Playas de Bavaro is OK. There is about 1-2 feet of flooding on the road to get there from the airport but the hotel is fine. They are still cleaning up.... picking up palm leaves, some palm trees, and fixing palapas that fell."

The staff are working diligently to clean up the debris from the trees and bushes. The pool and main buildings are all clean...today they are focusing on the beach but you really don't mind. Before we know it will all be gone and no sign of Maria will be here. The staff and folks here have been fantastic. Cheers to you all and I hope everyone has wonderful vacation.Edited: 2 years ago "
Out this Friday to Royalton thanks for the update really great to get the news these guys are getting back to normal .
Been trying to get info! Thank you.
"Based on a copy of a text posted in the Facebook Chic Travellers Group, operations are to resume there tomorrow afternoon (Monday Sept 25)."
Does anyone have any info about Natura Park Beach Eco-Resort? I'll be really greatful for the answer!
There is a group page called Paradisus Punta Cana you can follow if you have Facebookhttps:/…
"My parents sent me pictures from the beach at Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort. But...I am not able to add them to this post. Beach looks clean, a palm tree knocked down but it looks beautiful. People in the water enjoying their vacay!"
"Arrived at Dreams Palm Beach yesterday (Sept 23). Aside from some palm branches missing and some debris in the gardens, you’d never even know there was a hurricane! Pools are all open, beach is clean and beautiful, resort is fully functional (minus some issues with cable). It’s pretty quiet here, I imagine some people cancelled. There are also some transplants from dreams resort and spa, as that will be closed until October 9th. The drive from the airport to our resort had some minor flooding on the streets and downed trees. But I imagine most resorts are mostly back to normal or will be very soon. So glad we didn’t cancel our trip!!"
"For those seeking info on the Iberostar Grand Bavaro, I was told that the Grand is currently closed until October 1st. They said it was for renovations, however they may also be in the middle of storm related repairs."
"MermaidLife27 - Good report! Thank you. We are headed for Royalton PC on Oct. 10. Dreams is about five miles from RPC. We, like others, watched the storm and resulting damage, and considered cancelling our trip. Would have moved to Negril, but got caught in the ""everybody moving traffic"". Glad we are still on track to RPC. Sounds like it's going to be OK. Plus, Punta Cana needs our tourist $$ for help. We should be extra generous with tips!"
Quick update from Excellence El Carmen. Main pool and most the beach open today. Palm trees and palapas have taken a pounding. Those trees that survived have badly exposed roots now. A lot more beach damage here that's there seems to be at nearby Breathless.Also could see a whole row of top floor suites with their glass balcony missing/damaged. Place operating well.
Chic should be back up and running by Monday which is the 25th. I got this information from my travel agent. Very good news for those traveling there like me next week!
I think I've gone through most replies on this thread but wasn't able to see anything related to Zoetry. Could anyone advise if it sustained damage? Is any part of it closed? We are due to arrive next month and are really looking forward to our time there. Thank you!
Any information on Dreams Resort and Spa Punta Cana? I know it is closed at the moment until October 8 but I was Curious as to how much damage the resort and the beach got.
Thank you for taking time to respond to me! Enjo!
Thank you so much for posting about Dreams Palm Beach. We did not cancel our trip (we fly in on Tuesday) but considered it many times due tomorrow the lack of info specific to our hotel. Your post was most reassuring!
I have reservations at Catalonia Bavaro Beach Resort in Punta Cana Oct 21 -the 26 and I don't know what the status is after hurricane Maria and when I call the number for the hotel it just rings and rings . Does anyone know if the resort is ok
Im not familiar with DR... my first time traveling will be Oct 5th... im going to be staying Barceló Bavaro Beach Resort... I wanted to know what is it like after Maria... what is the weather like... it’s my 30th and I want to know what I should expect.... PC Mike I really value your opinion so if you could offer me insight as well as anyone else who is currently there or just left that would be awesome... THANKS
I am following this thread for the ‘honest’ assessment of Breathless.
"I have heard as of yesterday, Zoetry plans on receiving guests tomorrow. I suppose that could change."
I was wondering about the Catalonia Bavaro Beach Resort are they near each other
"I am arriving at Hard Rock Punta Cana on 9/30. We are staying until 10/7. Hard Rock has assured us the Beach and all pools are operating at 100% .

Anyone have any first hand info if this is correct for Hard Rock Punta Cana? Thanks."
"Hi everyone,We are planning to visit Punta Cana Sep 30 and stay at Riu. Please if anyone can inform is it worth visiting after Maria as am not sure how much damage plus quality of food, entertainment and other things have been impacted.Thanks a lot"

"deriley,Statement from Riu Hotels & Resorts.Hurricane MariaUpdate Thursday, September 21 – 12.30 pm (GMT +1) Fortunately, we can confirm that hurricane Maria didn’t cause any significant damage in the two RIU hotels in Puerto Plata and that all the guests and colleagues are fine.  The only damages caused by the storm at our hotels in Punta Cana and Puerto Plata occurred in the gardens due to the heavy rains and wind. The maintenance teams are already working to restore normality. As of today, Thursday 21, the eight RIU hotels in the Dominican Republic will be 100% operational and offering full service to their clients. http://tinyurl.com/yaca9fupAngie."
Just make sure you have insurance. I'm going the 18th through the 25th of October and there are some trees down there some damage to some of the wooden buildings by the pool but they're cleaning everything up quickly they expect to be done here within a couple weeks I have people from the resort that are telling me these things showing me pictures there's a little pawning on sidewalks inside the resort but as far as I know there is no damage to the hotel rooms. These people are working very hard to get it back and make it comfortable for everybody. It's a beautiful Resort I feel bad for everybody there this will be my 12th time there in less than three years so unless there's another hurricane coming which hopefully there won't be I'll be there whether there's flooding or not. But that's almost a month away so hopefully it will be fine. I was there last November it was flooded about a foot in some areas of the resort and they just truck to around trolley to round trolley to around through everything but it wasn't everywhere was just in some of the low spots. I still had a great time. As of two days ago it look like the pool bar was closed because the roof came down but the picture showed a bunch of workers there so I'm sure they'll have that up already. Good luck have fun. Diane

We understand the hurricane has since passed but even perhaps comments on current weather conditions? We ask because if its best to change dates, we still have the option to do so currently.Appreciate any responses and wishing all safe vacationing!"
PuntaCanaMike who lives there has just posted an update.https:/…86520447Angie.
Jodi F #1977 As per the dreams website they have it posted that Dreams Spa and Resort is closed until October 9th. I too will be down there end of October and am hopeful this does not delay any further!
"I just called hotel, there's many conflicting stories for dream spa punta cana, but woman assured me they are open."
"Hi everyone,I am from the UK and arrived in Punta Cana last night. We were due to stay at the Dreams resort and spa but as per the reports they aren't taking any further guests at the moment. We have been moved to Dreams Palm Beach instead, we weren't told this was going to happen until we found our rep at the airport, so we will be making a complaint about that as the communication was poor. We've also been given a twin room when we booked a double but this should be changed today when people check out.Dreams Palm Beach doesn't even look like they've experienced a hurricane recently, they've done a great job of clearing it up. Other than a small amount of plant remains to clear up it looks spot on, and that includes the beach. In fact the whole island looked like that when we transferred from the airport, other than trees down by the side of the road and some large puddles in areas it didn't look bad at all.For anyone coming to a Dreams resort, don't cancel because you will still have a great time. It's 10am here and I'm sat by the pool in 30 degree heat. The weather app says cloudy but there are about 2 clouds."
I'm due to arrive for my first trip to the DR on Oct 2nd. I'm staying at the Majestic Mirage; can anyone give me an update on the property?
Great news! thank you
The Barcelo Bavaro Palace had already been cleaned. They have removed the seaweeds that littered the beach and the broken branches on the ground. The place now looks excellent.
Do you know what and how much damage Dreams Resort and Spa has from the hurricane? We are due to arrive there in November and we're just wanting to see how bad it is.
"Michelle, according to posts on facebook, Dreams Punta Cana lost a roof off of one of their buildings and is closed for repairs until October 9th. By November everything should be fine."
Hello everyone.I really need your help. We have a planned trip in a couple of days to the Memories Splash (behind the Royalton) with our 2 kids.

Hello@Dan C!Did you have to pay anything in price differences? I contacted my agent and he's saying something in regards to that. But I'm thinking y if it's not by personal choiceThanks
"Secrets Cap Cana-I've been following the thread, Mrs1909 is there (or is there through today 9/25) and all is good and intact.Edited: 2 years ago "
Nope no extra charges for us. They actually asked if we wanted to move again today to La Ramona but didn't fancy packing up and moving again so we have stayed here. Have now changed to a King room as well which is what we booked at the other one so all is good
thank you! anxious to be there! Barry
@Dan C Thank you I will look into that as they are saying we will have a price diff to pay.
"@adriayd0114,If the resort is moving you for anything other then your request, I don't see why you should have to pay more."
Any update on Ocean Blue please?
Here at Ocean Blue. Clean up has been slow but its nearly fully back to normal now.
"Hey everyone, I am so sorry if this question has already been asked. There are just so many questions on here. I am supposed to be staying at Chic next week and the resort is not giving a straight answer on damages sustained. I need someone honest insight here. Damages to Chic?"

#2013: CHIC just published a notice on their FB page on Sunday that they did suffer some minor damage and flood and had a pretty significant clean up job on their hands but that everything is back to normal now.
Anyone news of Villas Bavaro Beach resort @ Punta Cana? We are arriving 13-10 with 2 kids....anyone news or pictures please?
"Christina R,I was also scheduled at Chic and was frustrated by the lack of communication so I switched to another resort. Even though they have finally posted some communication, I haven't heard from anyone that is currently at the resort and didn't feel comfortable that they would be ready by Oct. 7th"
Robert did you try contacting the resort to get info?
Anyone know how occidental punta cana/bávaro beach is doing?Edited: 2 years ago

Arriving the same day. Maybe we will see you there!
"Slyguy23,Not since I rebooked. I heard they were without power or phones for awhile. I just didn't have that warm fuzzy feeling and didn't want to be at a resort that was running on 3 legs while others seem to be fully operational."
Bavaro beach is fine.
"All good Robert. Evidently some resort chose to continue taking in guests and run through their clean up efforts. I believe CHIC was trying to get to 100% to avoid any issues or inconveniences to their guests. Obviously, this doesn't justify not answering queries from future guests of course. They posted again this morning and are definitely up and running at 100%. Hope you have a great trip nonetheless."
Thanks Slyguy. Do you know where they posted? I don't see anything on their website.
Here you go Robert. On their FB page:https://www.facebook.com/CHICPuntaCana/
Anyone at Riu resorts? Heading over from Manchester on Monday just abit concerned resorts and also outside of resorts will be damaged - also what's like chances of hurricane ended and everything beginning to clear up by next week? Thanks

HelloCurrently staying at the mirage. Beautiful here. Perfect weather. They are up and running. You can see they are still making minor repairs but nothing that has dampened our trip.
Does anyone have any info regarding any damage sustained at The Level @ Melia Tropical Caribe in Punta Cana? I read in a post but now can not find it that the Level is closed first stated damage from Maria.. then just closed for renovations??? Plan to be there 10/13-21 and not sure what is going on.
Have you gotten any info? I can't seem to find anything.
"Thank you again Slyguy. I might be the last person not on FB which is why I didn't see it. There last post was obviously last week. An updated post that they are now open and operational would have gone a long way but its obvious that communication is not their strong suit,Charlie M,I switched to Riu because all reports seem to indicate that the are up and running and I've even seem peoples Instagram pictures and all looks well there. And of course we have PC Mike also confirming the same.."
"I've been following this thread non-stop. We got the majestic elegance today. It's fantastic, don't cancel a damn thing. If you're here come have a drink!"
Does anybody know how much damage there was to excellence resort punta Cana?
Melia has the Angora and Quatro restaurants closed for renovations. They had the adult pool closed to be painted. Business as usual.
Hi! Are yo there people? Is it everything ok? What about Bayahibe? Is it safe nowadays? I'm going to stay at The Reserve MeliA en Punta Cana and Dreams at Bayahibe. Opinions about the site after Maria? Thanks to everybody! :)
Any news on the Bahia Principe Green? Was there much damage? Is everything up and running? We are to arrive sept 30I have e-mailed them many time and no response.Anything news would be appreciated

"All courses open to my knowledge. Ibero is going through a redesign of the back 9, thus only the front open."
"My wife and I arrived on September 24th To the Bahia Principe Armbar green ... besides a few young palm trees down and some missing roof shingles, the place looks great, and is running normal . A few of the sister hotels have closed restaurants, but the others have made up for them.Edited: 2 years ago "

"We have been at the Catalonia Royal Bavaro for the past week. It started off pretty shaky.... the grounds were a mess, a lot of the areas (restaraunts, bars, beach, pools etc) where closed. The staff here have beenworking non stop to get the place back together. Other than a few areas that had severe damage.. the place is up and running and as beautiful as ever!! The ocean is still pretty murky but they did start up the scuba diving and water sports yesterday. The wifi is spotty here so I haven't been able to read all the posts so if I reiterated what someone else has already said .. please don't be rude and leave me a nasty comment :)"
We were evacuated from Puerto Plata on the 19th. # days earlier than our flight. Now I am trying to get a compensation for the unused nights. Can you please give me a link to such a topic on the website? I cant find one. Thanks!
Lizka - that's going to depend if you have insurance and with whom. Check with your travel agency and the credit card you used. You can always try contacting the hotel direct as well.That all said: No Insurance usually means no refunds.
"Lizka, We were evacuated on Sept 19th with 5 days remaining in our vacation. I contacted Westjet Vacations and were told that it was an insurance matter. We have travel insurance though our charge card. I called them, they verified we have hurricane insurance, and they e-mailed me the forms. We filled them out and e-mailed them back with the necessary documents. I was told it should take about 6-8 weeks for a refund."
Thank you.
"Anyone know how Presidential Suites fared with hurricane Marie, we are arriving Oct. 1?"
Does anyone know how Presidential Suites fared the storm?
Cheers PCMike
Presi Suites are fine.
did chic hotel get any damage
"Chic has this on their FB page todayThanks to everyone for your support and patience! We are back, and in perfect condition. This is what #CHICPuntaCana looks like today!"
Mike the cold front is coming to Canada. IS this ok?
That's encouraging news. Thank you for the information. We arrive Saturday
"Hello,Curious if you made it down there? Is everything OK?We're headed to the Iberostar Grand Bavaro on Oct. 8th. Iberostar corporate says hotel is fine and to call direct...calling direct and no one is answering for multiple days, doesn't matter what time of day it is...."
Iberostar grand is under construction from Sept 1-Sept 30. This is why no one is answering. I'm heading to Iberostar grand October Oct 18. Received an email today that all of the Iberostar resorts in PC are all running as normal.
did you get the paper at the airport to cancel after checking baggage?
"did anyone fly with sunwing sept 18 at 6:15 am from Toronto. flight wg420 yyz if so I need the paper that we were given after checking our baggage, sunwing is denying giving out this paper and therefor not refunding me with a voucher or change of destination"
did you fly with sunwing?
Any update on luxury Bahia principe Esmeralda .. anyone there?. Anyone at one of there sister resorts that can check the Esmeralda out ? Thanks!
I am at the Bahia principe ambar green and everything is fine. We saw a palm tree down here and there in the gardens but nothing crazy. Hotels are running normal. Weather has been beautiful.
"Awesome, Thank you!"
Does anyone have any up to date info on Ocean Blue & Sand.......could someone there now advise it the hotel fared after Hurricanes irma & Maria?Thank you in advance
"Hi all - been here at the majestic mirage since last Saturday (in punta cana, look up the location if near your hotel rather than ask about yours specifically- they're all in the same condition in this area). Literally the weather has been perfect. We decided not to change plans because of this forum so thanks for everyone's helpful posts last week! We haven't seen any rain (although we sleep in) and suns been out every day, all day. The resorts have had very minimal impact from the hurricanes and seem to have done an amazing job cleaning up, even when we got here only 3 days after. Especially in the places that matter, inside the walls and on the beach. A few have shingles missing or had small damage that they'll clean up over the coming weeks but it won't impact your trip. Ours has a flooded soccer field that we drove in past but that's about it. As you come in from the airport you'll see where trees have come down too. We're so sad to leave tomorrow! Do not change your plans for ""thunderstorms"" because our forecast said there was a chance of them every day leading up til the day we got here and it's been insanely gorgeous weather. The staffs been great, and we felt like the place belonged to us all week because I think a lot of people canceled their trips. Those of you not traveling til October will probably not notice any changes to your resort by the time you get here.Time for my last day to float in the pool!"
I am leaving September 30th for Barcelo Bavaro Beach Adults Only. I heard all is well there but need confirmation from guests.Edited: 2 years ago 
"I am heading from JFK to Punta Cana on Sept 30th, and wanted to know if anyone has insight on conditions at The Level Melia Caribe Tropical. Thank you for your response in advance, BestSunnyEdited: 2 years ago "
"Thanks for your review, Its showing thunderstorms for the time we are there as well Sept 30th to Oct 4th so was kinda worried."
"Thanks Kristen M, we are going to the Majestic Mirage on Sunday and we are pumped!"
Hi all. We checked in at Majestic Mirage today and everything is amazing!! It's also SUPER SUPER quiet and probably at 20% capacity! You can almost argue that it's too quiet. Everything is open and 100% functional. They have moved everyone to one side of the resort due to a construction site on the other side! But that doesn't change anything at all. Whoever will be joining us here is bound to have an amazing time! :)Edited: 2 years ago 
I am traveling in 3 weeks to Secrets Cap Cana in Punta Cana and I noticed that you were due to travel now. How is the island fairing after the Storm?Edited: 2 years ago 
all is fine
Hi we are currently here and it’s perfect. no damage and all resort is open.
"I don't think I'll ever get over the very first response in this thread, when someone tried discounting what this hurricane would ultimately do."
"Can anyone comment to the state of Luxury Bahia Principe Ambar Blue suites? Given they are closer to the beach, I wished to know of any flooding or reported damages?Thanks. Travelling Oct 5th - 12th."
you will be fine...it has been very dry now for a week and most landscape clean up is done...everywhere.PCMike
Much appreciated Mike! I think I speak for many in this forum when I say you have truly been an invaluable resource. Thanking you.Cheers. Sunny
"My wife and I just got back from Armbar green today, spent a lot of time at armbar blue’s pool and restaurants everything is running great ..."
I am at Secrets Cap Cana now and everything is fine! We've been here all week and it's been beautiful! You would never know hurricane Maria swept by. Enjoy your visit!
Hey everyone...we are here at Dreams La Romana. I can tell you that everything is normal. Everything is open. The drive from the airport was smooth with very little signs of a hurricane coming through here. If you are thinking of booking here or have booked..don't worry about a thing.
"#2086 ""don't think I'll ever get over the very first response in this thread, when someone tried discounting what this hurricane would ultimately do"".Really? Are you serious? Didn't realise someone's opinion could have such an impact! Hope you do get over it."
Can you give me information on the conditions at the Onyx resort in Punta Cana?
Can anyone give me the condition of the Onyx Resort in Punta Cana?
Just got back today from a week at Secrets Cap Cana....it was beautiful!!! You would never know that a hurricane swept by a week and a half ago. Enjoy your trip!!
"Hello all ,I have not been to Punta Cana before , can anyone recommend a good resort to stay in.ThanksKim"
Got home from Barcela beach all was clear in 2 days
"Hello, depends on your budget, we always went to gorgeous Melia level adults but it' too huge to walk in hot weather. Now we go to Catalonia royal every year which is the perfect size to walk and no reservations for dinners needed. In all others you do need it. They also have family side. We love it, the food is awesome. Have a great trip, do not forget to buy travel ins. Insure my trip.com. You get much better coverage through them than from travel sites for the same money."
"Was anyone evacuated by Sunwing on September 19th from Punta Cana returning to Toronto, if so, have you heard from Sunwing about the travel vouchers for the days missed, the ones they told us we would get when we boarded the plane. it going on 4 weeks and my travel agent put our claim in that same day. Thank youEdited: 2 years ago "
"no, but it'll take a long time,,,, sometimes up to 6 months...try contacting sunwing with your claim/file number."
They said chic didnt have any damage .... I just book with them and need to know if I should cancel thanks
"Did you read any of the 2000+ posts? If you simply read 10 of the latest, you will find your answer.Cheers and enjoy!PCMike"
why book then check?
Why comment if you werent going to resolve my issue ? Honestly i booked in excitement and forgot all about the storm .
"Brandy...not to dwell, but if 2000 posts did not give you an answer, why not read some of the latest reviews...say 100 or so, and you will see that your concerns should be put at ease."
Brandy are you serious? This was months ago. Just to be sure you should cancel.
