"Man flu - enough said.Sounds like a nice day. We use Disney shuttles all the time, I am resigned to them seeing as my son won't let me attempt to drive out there, me, road rage, never.Well done reaching 25 years. It's my 30th this year, only because we take separate holidays. Us to Orlando, and hubby Stornoway fishing trips. he can have man flu all he likes up there."
Poor hubby hope he gets better soon. Congrats to you both and to you helpmabob for 25/30 years We will be 10 years in April while we are over there.
"We do use the buses when we stay on site and yes they can try your nerves after awhile, luckily we only go 6 days (that's what's nice about on site at Universal, can just walk or boat, much nicer). Hope hubby feels better. Happy Anniversary (we're 38 yrs in June), where does the time go, enjoy Universal if you go :)"
Another nice day sorry your DH had the flu it stinks when you get sick on vacation and as for getting around it will always be a rental car for us even if i stayed at one of Disney's resorts the buses can be time consuming and Happy Anniversary congrats on 25 years.
I feel your pain on the Disney buses susie we stayed at AKL for 3 nights a couple of years ago and it took just short of an hour from walking out the hotel to arriving a DS.
nice to see a trip report on here at last. all seen to have died off cheers susie
Nice to hear some unbiased facts about the Disney buses susieb. Enjoy your golf tomorrow. Happy Anniversary!
"Quote “what a fabulous resort, apart from the music which would drive me potty if I was there for a week”We’ve stayed there that often susie, ours brains automatically block that out now;-);-)...lol...Have a great anniversary, don’t let the “man flu” spoil it:-):-)Buses, I agree there, that’s why we nearly always use our hire car;-);-)Edited: 2 years ago "
Quote “Man flu - enough said“That’s very “sexist” there helpmabob;-);-)...lol...
Don’t you start Marion;-);-)...lol...
"Oh Susie poor man. Know how he feels just getting over mine. Have a great 25th Anniversary and enjoy the sun. I live in Shropshire and have had snow, hail, rain and now sun and blumming cold. Have fun"
"Nice TR - Thanks for sharing. Also, bad luck getting sick on vacation."
"I can deal with the music, what gets me at Disney are the creepy people who you dont know, who are both outside and inside the doors of the hotel saying 'welcome home'.I dont like that from people i dont know in a place that isnt home lolAnd happy 25th. We are on our 30th later this month. A life sentence ;)"
"Suzie,If you want to do something special for your 25th, sign up and go back to AKL for the Sunset Safari and Wine and Food Pairing Dinner at Jiko - the cooking place. Unlike viewing the animals at a distance you are picked up right in front of the AKL and have a close encounter with the animals in the various safaris surrounding the AKL. The animals are right next to the open canopy vehicle and the giraffes stick there heads really close! You can get much better pictures than you can by walking around at the lodge. The dinner has changed over the years; when we first did the wine and food pairing dinner years ago you had to be staying Club level at the AKL and it was a formal plated affair. Now any guests can sign up and the food is served family style, but the wine pairing remains with a sommelier detailing the various wines you enjoy from Africa. The wines are available for purchase after your meal and you are also given a ""goodie bag"" as you leave. We have liked this experience so much, my wife and i have flown down to WDW,2x and stayed at AKL just to do the wine and food pairing meal!In terms of your dislike for the Disney buses, if you stay at a WDW Deluxe Resort your use of the buses is minimal to go between the parks except AKL. We like staying on the property as EPCOT and MK are easy to go to by short walks (EPCOT Deluxe Resorts or Contemporary Resort). We use the Disney Magic Express buses for pickup and returning to MCO Airport. Easy - no parking hassles!"
"Not to scare, but we are in the midst of a very serious flu epidemic.https://www.today.com/video/flu-epidemic-cou…So don’t take the “man flu” lightly.Keep a careful watch on the symptoms.Edited: 2 years ago "
Thanks for the report Susie. Was it easy for you as a resort visitor to get a good view of the giraffes etc? We are there in April for our 50th anniversary
"Cardi,If you access the Lodge viewing area it will be hit or miss as it is a small walkway out into the enclosure to see any animals at all including the giraffes. If you stay at the ALK and have a savannah view room your chances increase. You are guaranteed a great closeup view and pictures of all of the animals including the giraffes if you do the Sunset Safari and Food and Wine Pairing Meal. See my post #16 above for details. It would be a splendid idea for your 50th!Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hi CardiThere is “higher” viewing area off the main lobby area, with rocking chairs:-):-)I’ve sat there many times, with a cold drink watching the world go bye..Although only a few rockers, it does depend on when you go, I’m usually able to get a seat:-):-)You could also pop across to Kidani for a look, although way smaller, it’s not as busy;-);-)Edited: 2 years ago "
susieDo enjoy your special anniversary with your husband
Hi SwimFanA round of golf “is” special;-);-)...lol...(Depending on how one plays)..Edited: 2 years ago 
"Great Report, keep powering through the flu and have a happy anniversary!"
Thank you all for your advice
"Hey Susie,Hope you are still having fun on your trip."
