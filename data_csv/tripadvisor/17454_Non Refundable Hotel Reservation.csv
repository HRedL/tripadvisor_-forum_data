Has anyone had a positive or negative experience receiving a voucher for future use from a hotel if you had to cancel your reservation due to Coronavirus that was originally booked as non refundable?
"There are posts on various threads here of travelers who got some love and compassion from hotels with their non-refundable reservations. Some report a partial refund, some I believe more, some none. I don't recall any specific mentions of vouchers.Good luck with your reservation."
"I'm not meaning this sarcastically, Jim L, but whether some people have had success and some haven't- all you can do is contact your hotel and ask!Like Lennybruce said, it's a 'maybe'. Just ask. If you are refused a refund, realise it's just because it's what you booked in the first place."
"Not me. My hotel’s policy was free cancellation until 2 weeks before and I contacted them 15 days before to thank them for being so helpful until then but because corona was getting serious in Japan I was not sure about my trip so I was going to cancel it and if I ended up going, I would rebook with them if they had availability. They replied that I didn’t need to cancel and I wouldn’t be charged anything if I ended up canceling. So, based on their kindness and understanding and ultimate lies, I didn’t cancel it. And then the country was put on lockdown on March 15 and my reservation was for March 16 and I cancelled it. No refund and now no response. Even Booking .com has sent them messages and they’re not responding. Hopefully they will get cut from Booking .com or worse if they need to rip off people like this."
"If you kept the reservation 15 days before, then the next day is the 14 day before you went, so the cut-off day for 'free cancellation'. If you don't have the bit about 'don't worry about cancelling' in an email, that's going to be tough to prove.I understand you would like your money back, but the number of such businesses that will be going under due to the virus will be huge, and you can't really blame them for hanging on to a bit of finance.Edited: 9:32 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Yes, no problem with Hilton or Marriott."
"Centralvic, I really don’t care if they go out of business. I’ve lost a lot of income here in Japan since this started with schools being closed down but I’m not going to steal money from others to make up for it. It’s nice to see that Japanese hotels continue to give full refunds to people with non refundable bookings. I guess the Netherlands is a different story and expect “donations” from around the world to keep them afloat. The messages from the hotel are in the booking .com messaging system. The one agent I’ve been able to speak to said that and they “should” refund the money and sent them a message. It has gone unanswered. It’s not my responsibility to keep liars in business."
"“ I guess the Netherlands is a different story and expect “donations” from around the world to keep them afloat.”There are lots of hotels in the Netherlands who allow people to cancel or reschedule. I know you have had a bad experience with 1 hotel and I’m sorry for you, but please don’t project this on our entire country."
"The hijack aside and responding to the OP:The repose in post #2 is what I would recommend. The Dutch have a saying which translates "" a ""no"" I have, a ""yes"" I can get"".""Not all those who wander are lost.” ― J.R.R. Tolkien"
I have a non-refundable reservation at the Conscious Hotel and despite the fact Europe has closed borders and my airline and event has canceled they will not agree to a refund. I am a senior on a pension who has been told by the hotel (Vondelpark) that if the Netherlands closes its border they will issue refund but now they are hedging saying they will wait until a week before booking to decide. I expected this a big corporate hotel but Conscious Hotels are all about taking responsibility but they seem comfortable with their double standard despite the fact I cannot get into the country before my booking begins. It is sad to experience this indifference Conscious Hotels to my plight at a time when the world is under siege by a silent killer that is taking its toll everywhere including the Netherlands.
@Peter L; for what date is your booking?
I emailed my hotel today and they agreed to refund the non refundable booking for our stay.I appreciate their understanding as this situation is out of anyone's hand currently.Really very sad to cancel the dream trip of admiring tulips.Which are already looking very promising in update photos.But we don't want to contribute to the spreading of this pandemic.
"@PeterL, seems to be more than “one hotel” and their national airline too. KLM isn’t refunding either."
"My Amsterdam hotel refused to refund or change my non refundable and said to take it up with insurance. My Doubletree non refundable was cancelled with no problems. Lesson learned, stick with larger chain I guess........."
"I purchased travel insurance with Allianz, one of the larger firms. The plan does not cover claims because of a pandemic. From what read most companies do not cover claims due to epidemics or pandemics."
"Allianz will cover just about anything you can think of. All you have to do is pay for it. As for the national airline, they will refund if they cancel the flight which in all probability will happen if it hasn't already.The biggest problem I see is that everyone wants a refund NOW. I would suggest letting things get sorted out before calling folks liars and suggesting they're stealing money. I understand folks live in their own limited little universe but everyone is trying to cope including hotels and airlines that are up to their ears trying to answer everyone all at the same time. ""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness""--Mark Twain"
"The problem is that people entered into a binding legal contract——I will book a non refundable if you will give me a greatly discounted rate.It’s a contract that both sides say they will abide by.It’s also a gamble. I want a lower discount rate and I will take the risk that I will never have to cancel for any reason.Like betting on a football games outcome. It’s a gamble.Many of us will always opt to pay more every time we travel and will only book a refundable. We book a refundable for days just like this.In the history of forum hotel advice here I can’t remember anyone ever suggesting non refundable rates over refundable. Even with bidding when you could get a $300 hotel for $80 non refundable we always suggested booking as close to travel as you can.We always say——book a hotel you can cancel. Especially if booked in weeks or months in advance.Now those that gambled to pay less want the same benefits we who paid more are receiving.Take the gamble—-get a discount rate over and above what others pay—-then don’t care if the hotel goes out of business giving the gamblers their money back because their bet went bad.Next time book a refundable and pay more like the rest of us do.And if you are a gambler at least understand the element of risk.Edited: 11:01 am, March 19, 2020 "
"+1 for #15 and #16. There are a lot of hotels (not your Hiltons, the NH's and the like, but those that are not part of a big group) who may well go bust this year because of this catastrophic pandemic, if they can't 'take the hit' of losing lots of bookings because people decide they no longer want to come, whether or not they have booked. Hotels, restaurants, bars, attractions etc. are all going to suffer and we need to cut them some slack."
Welcome back John. You OK?
"We also paid a non-refundable rate for a hotel in Amsterdam, via booking.com. They refused to refund us even partially,nor they offered some other date. I wrote them several times that our flight is cancelled, borders are closed an there is no possible way we could travel, even if we wanted to, but they didn't bother. I cannot accept this, it is totally outrageous that they do not consider force majeure. I would like to contact some tourism authority in Amsterdam. Anybody who could help with this? It wasn't cheap at all..."
"Welcome to the forum Bogoljub N- Most people who book non-refundable do that because they purchase or already have trip-travel insurance to cover the possibility of having to cancel.What does your insurance say ?Edited: 3:48 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Unfortunately, I don't have one, never heard of, because where I live it is not something common. I think this is the first time I booked non-refundable, I didn't even see the option for free cancelation. However, I think it's totally up to the hotel whether they will accept refund or not."
"I'm sorry that you have been burnt on the first occasion you have booked a non refundable rate. That is very bad luck, especially given that you aren't covered by any insurance.It is absolutely down to the hotel as to whether they will enforce the terms of the contract between them and the guest or not. As said earlier, many business are going to suffer and fail because of the COVID-19 situation. Not just in The Netherlands but across Europe and the rest of the world.The big chains are likely to be in a stronger position than small, independent businesses, but while they might be unlikely to fail completely, they are still going to suffer financially.It's not a nice time for anyone."
"I've come across quite a few bad reports about booking.comI'm under the impression that they will charge any hotels booked via them a commission which they won't waive, which explains why the hotels won't allow you to cancel as it would actually cost them the commission on top of the cancellation. For several reasons I believe it's better to book a hotel direct instead of using a middle man."
"Hilton and Marriott have been very cooperative, but they are in the minority. Some countries have closed hotels, airbnb’s, etc. If the government of the Netherlands closes hotels there, I would think all properties there would have to refund non refundable reservations. But otherwise nothing requires them to do so.On the travel insurance question, many exclude epidemics or pandemics.Edited: 7:01 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Good advice MrjohnMd but I booked through Tripmasters, a highly reputable booking site. They did not offer a refundable option."
"In fact, booking.com recommends to all of premises that they should refund all bookings and in that case booking.com will waive its fees for all premises. However, I found later in the terms and conditions on the hostel website that they do not refund even in the force majeure case. I bet they have changed that recently.Edited: 7:11 pm, March 19, 2020 "
">Good advice MrjohnMd but I booked through Tripmasters, a highly reputable booking site. They did not offer a refundable option.<Take this for what it's worth - just one man's opinion. NEVER, EVER book through a third party consolidator when traveling. Doesn't matter what part of travel you're talking about. Don't do it!""Not all those who wander are lost.” ― J.R.R. Tolkien"
"i was lucky enough to have my NH Amsterdam hotel refund me fully for a non refundable booking, albeit just for a few days booking. I emailed them, they replied overnight, and i received a credit on my credit card 2 days later. It would definitely make me look at them again if i needed to book an airport hotel in the future.Edited: 8:03 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"“ Take this for what it's worth - just one man's opinion. NEVER, EVER book through a third party consolidator when traveling. Doesn't matter what part of travel you're talking about. Don't do it!”Couldn’t agree more Ddavis! I just don’t understand this booking via a third party. If you would ask the people that do this if they also use a third party to buy their groceries or morning coffee, they would probably think you’ve lost your mind. They don’t seem to understand that someone is paying for the “service” that these third party booking sites provide. That someone is the consumer, the hotel/airline/etc or both. Especially hotels have to pay huge fees to these booking platforms. That’s why a lot of hotels offer a discount if you book with them directly. So while I use a booking platform to search for hotels I always book direct.And with regards to the “service” they are providing, check out the airline forum. It’s full of topics from people who bought their plane tickets from a third party and who are left to fend for themselves."
"Not always, often i book through a third party in NZ as its often cheaper than some hotels if you book direct. I have also been upgraded many times by a hotel , even although i booked through a third party and not direct with them. Also through the 3rd party site, i get credit perks towards food etc . I always book with airlines direct though."
"While for flights and cars etc I fully agree on not using a third party site, for hotels I'm not sure. There's more and more hotels who actually use booking.com or expedia as their primary booking service.Apart from that, especially in the developing world, I really can't be bothered with hotels who may or may not accept credit cards, demand a copy of my passport when i book through their site etc. I just can't be bothered to go along with tbose shenenigans and booking.com takes them away from me or at least is clear on what I can expect."
I always look on Booking.com first and then see if I will get a better deal on the hotel site itself .
"Many hotels will match the price on booking when contacted directly, and sometimes throw in extras like a breakfast. The fee for the middle man has to come from somewhere..."
"We always compare rates and a lot of time it comes out either the same or cheaper on a third party booking site. These sites (we mainly use booking.com) offer a quick and easy way to book. Now and then, when we want a particular small hotel somewhere remote that doesn't use the middle man, then we have to jump through hoops (language barrier, deposit via bank transfer, ...) to reserve directly. Third party booking sites give more exposure to hotels that are on their site, and make booking easier for the travelers."
"Most direct hotel websites will have the disclaimer ""lowest rate guaranteed"".Like using SkyScanner for flights, use consolidators like booking.com or trivago to take advantage of their filters but then go to the hotel directly. I think I've had to reference an advertised price once or twice to get that rate or better. I can't remember not getting an advertised price (no strings attached) directly with the hotel.""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness""--Mark Twain"
“ I can't remember not getting an advertised price (no strings attached) directly with the hotel.”Same for me. Years ago I heard from the owner of the accomodation we were staying at what extortionate fees Booking.com and the likes are charging them. Especially the big names know they can ask for a high percentage. It’s take it or leave it. Ever since then I always book direct. I’ve never paid more than the price on booking.com and I never had any issues with booking or payment or whatever.
"""Like using SkyScanner for flights, use consolidators like booking.com or trivago to take advantage of their filters..""Isn't this the reason why these sites charge a fee to the hotels? Because they facilitate the search that leads travelers to hotels?"
"Yes, of course that’s why they charge the fee. That’s their entire business model. Interestingly enough they are very vague about their fee. On the English version of the website, they say this; “ The Booking.com commission percentage varies per country. Our global commission rate average is 15%, among the lowest in the industry, and can vary depending on your property type or location.”Source; https:/…how-much-commission-do-i-payOn the Dutch version of their website they are a bit more honest; “ Het door Booking.com gehanteerde commissiepercentage verschilt per land. Het commissiepercentage ligt tussen de 10% en 25%, afhankelijk van het type accommodatie en de locatie.”Source; https:/…hoeveel-commissie-moet-ik-betalenYou don’t need to know Dutch to understand that the commission can vary from 10% to 25%. And yes, that’s up to 25% of the rate you pay!!! That’s why it’s always worth to book direct with the accomodation. Both for you and the hotel.Edited: 2:53 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"""that’s up to 25% of the rate you pay""Then I am even more surprised when I see higher rates on hotel's website than on booking.com. I tend to book direct when they give me the same rate or cheaper, which happens more often for hotels in SE Asia.Anyway, the business agreement between hotels and third party booking sites is exactly that, between them :) As a traveler, I am going with the rate that works the best for my budget.Let's stay safe and healthy! This too shall pass!"
"“ Then I am even more surprised when I see higher rates on hotel's website than on booking.com.”That’s because booking.com and the likes don’t allow them to advertise a lower rate on their own website than the rate on the third party website. Yes, they have so much power. But as confirmed by several posters in this thread, if you contact the hotel directly you will always get a lower rate."
"The issue isn’t that hotels in the Netherlands were ordered to close. Also their bar licenses are not revoked. Hotels in the Netherlands are still allowed to stay open and accomodate guests. They must however close their restaurant and bar, just like other restaurants, cafes and bars were ordered to close. Hotels are still allowed to provide room service to their guests.My issue with platforms like booking.com is that while they are happily taking a commission of up to 25% when people make a booking thru their website, they refuse to take action now and keep referring their customers to the hotel."

Irony is .. Air B &B which is considered ill legal in many cities has been quite successful managing by offering 100% refund ..
I use Booking.com about half the time- but I never book a non refundable hotel through them. I had to cancel my hotel in Bruges today- cancellation period was free up to a week before arrival. No issues.
"Hotels do not always offer the same rates as third party sites. I know because i have called certain hotels to be told to go ahead and book on the third party site. Also, on certain third party sites i can get free nights, and also food credits. I never get that going direct with the hotel. So i think it just depends on the hotel / chain."
"<>Not always, it depends if the original cancellation is 100% refundable.The cancellation on one of my bookings is full refund minus AirBnb service fee. I booked the same place in 2 separate blocks. AirBnb refunded one at 100%, yet for the other booking on the same place is deducting their service fee."
"Everyone is talking and talking but is someone able to give to the community a government email adress, like ministry of tourism, where people can complain (whatever their motives may be because it's not our business) ?"

"Yes with my reservations in Paris, London and Bruges.I am still awaiting response from hotel in Amsterdam.Not sure if I'll ever recoup that money."
"My husband and and I had a reservation at the Singel Hotel in Amsterdam March 31-April 2, 2020. Despite emailing the hotel several times, they refuse to give a refund or voucher. I would be happy with a voucher or credit. My travel insurance will not compensate. I understand it was non refundable, however this pandemic is a much different situation. Everyone stay safe!"
"The only hotel that we haven’t had any success with has been in Amsterdam. We have written them twice and still waiting.We have not had any other issues. Our cruise, airline, tours and hotels in Paris, Brussels, London and Rome have been very courteous. When we reschedule this trip we will rebook and bring business to those that accommodated us. Remdmber- the best advertising will always be - “a satisfied customer”."
I have a similar sentiment Patrick. My hostel in Amsterdam has been the only to not work with me. Rescheduling the trip for this time time next year (as long as all is well). I look forwards to supporting the businesses that have worked with their customers. I'm looking at extending my itinerary and spending more time at the places that were accommodating to support them and the rest of the tourism industry in their areas. A benefit to pushing the trip back - more spending money!
"This is the only hotel that didn't refund anything. Their response after multiple emails and finally calling them(2 months worth) is this-We lose 30% of our money and they gave us a voucher with a 10% discount on a future stay. We are starting to replan our 40th anniversary trip which emcompassed 5 European counries and a European cruise (Princess Enchanted). We will not stay or recommend this hotel to anyone. Some might say business is business but doing the right thing is human. We have been saving for years for this trip and feel we have been treated unfairly.Edited: 10:36 am, May 06, 2020 "
Our Viking Cruise & airline reservations (Switzerland to Amsterdam) were cancelled.I have two rooms reserved for 9 days July 2-11 at Hotel Vondelpark. Booking.com has been no help.Hotel Vondelpark has only been willing to give me a voucher (good until 03/2021). They have my credit card & plan to charge me $2800 if I cancel.  I’m planning to wait until a bit closer to my reservation to see if border closures & “Forced Circumstances” (I’m from USA) induce them to release my reservation without penalty.Any insights would be appreciated!
I had 4 rooms booked with the XO couture hotel for the 1st August. 3 rooms booked direct and 1 booked through booking.com.All rooms non refundable.XO hotels have been excellent in handling my predicament.A credit note issued valid until 12/2021 but I need to book my rooms before the end of March 2021.Massive thank you to the guy at central reservations for XO who helped me out.KLM also doing a cash refund for the 8 flights that they cancelled.While disappointed that the trip won’t be going ahead in August am also relieved as I personally think that waiting till next year is in the best interest of everyone.Better safe than sorry.
"I had booked a stay at the Hotel PrinsenhuisIn Amsterdam for early May. I cancelled using the hotels stated cancellation policy in early March. The owner has told me that my booking was refundable and that he received the cancellation but has taken the full cost out of my bank. The owner will only offer a future stay . I would not be able to use the voucher . I feel really upset and powerless. It seems that hotels can break the law and there is no one to complain too.Edited: 9:13 am, June 19, 2020 "
Do a chargeback on your credit card and attach the mail from the hotel or the cancellation policy at the time as proof.
Thank you for the advice. Sadly it was paid on a debit card. I will be wiser next time. As we are no longer in the E.U it is not possible to use the small claims court or the European consumer organisation. So it is a case of waving the money goodbye. The owner chose to ignore my cancellation request and grab the cash. Be careful when you book next time people.
You are still EU. So for now you can still use those institutions.
Good news! Thank you .
