"ok so if it goes from pan to epidemic before i leave my trip will be delayed until it clears up, that much i get. BUT what happens if they call it epidemic once i'm there and they close the borders? has anything like that ever happened? "
"Thats a big what if question.....Not bad bieng stuck in paradise I might say. As long as the beer is cold. Last time a border was closed was 1961 Berlin, hell I dont know....Why the complicated question?...Ha!! "
well i figure if i get there and they do make me stay maybe i might be able to waste a day with a timeshare shark for a free trip to tulum. haha. no really i was just wondering.
"I think I'd rather enjoy East Berlin in its glory day, than with a Timeshare Guy....I think its too eary in the ball game to see what govt does regarding borders and such. "
"on second thought i will explore tulum on my own dollar. if anything this flu scare will just weed out the true die hard coz fans. unless they put up a warning saying that my head is gonna fall off or you cant drink sol, i'm there in 14 days."
"Actually, I think it's the other way around...epidemic if it's localized...pandemic if it spreads across borders. BUT have you noticed all the talk about violence has gone away? Maybe the kidnappers / drug guys have all caught the flu."
well if this flu bug causes a panic and prices drop i will be able to afford a 3rd trip to coz this year !
"More new about this from this morning. It's already being reported in many countries, not just Mexico.http://tinyurl.com/ch886o"
