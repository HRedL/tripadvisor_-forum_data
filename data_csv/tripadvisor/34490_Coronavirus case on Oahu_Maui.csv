Just seen this pop up on my Facebook feed.https:/…
"You beat me to it :-). I was going to post this info as well. Here's an article from Hawaii News Now:https:/…I've seen a huge increase in people wearing masks here on Maui over the last 2 weeks. .....for what they are worth (not much most of the time).It's really been a matter of time for the first cases to be found in Hawaii. There are almost 50 people in 'self' quarantine and at least one in official quarantine (he's on Oahu). Due to the incubation period, the lack of test kits, and other factors I am sure we have a number of cases all over already."
"Buh bye, tourism."
"Would be nice to know exactly where he stayed and what dates and if he took any tours, etc..... Although they say it's likely he wasn't contagious while on Maui and wore a mask, I don't think they can really say FOR SURE that he couldn't have transmitted it. UGH."
"Maybe........He stayed at the Hilton HV timeshare on Oahu. That's when he started feeling the symptoms.He didn't have any symptoms until after leaving Maui and being on Oahu for a couple of days. Sure, he might still have had it and passed it.......or maybe not.Then again--you can get a cold or a flu anywhere..........not just this virus.Edited: 6:38 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"It is good to be concerned and monitor this - but remember that many more people die from many other causes every day.You could stay home, but people die every day falling down in their house.I am not trivializing, just advocating a balanced view."
"I totally agree that many die of other causes and you can catch a virus of any sort anywhere. We just have little ones that we come in contact with, so for nothing other than peace of mind it would just be nice to know. That's all."
"Sure, and I get that. But there are already cases in Washington and California.......much more close to you and you could have been exposed a month or more ago.This man was only on Maui for about 3 days. Again--he didn't have any symptoms until he'd been on Oahu for a couple of days. No, that doesn't ""guarantee"" that he didn't pass it on...as they are reluctantly admitting all over now.Also........though I got deleted weeks ago for saying it--this was **always** going to make it to Hawaii. Just like it's going to make it to many, many other states and countries.Edited: 6:48 pm, February 14, 2020 "
#7 yes.It’s now one state over from me. I’m sure it will continue to spread as the days pass.
Where did this person stay on Maui?
"No doubt it is going spread. A month from now there will countless cases. But we are travel twice in the next six weeks unless it s not permitted. I used to get sick every time I got on a plane, this is really the same thing."
Pattie he stayed on the West side near the Denny’s.
"Let’s just hope that this virus behaves as similar viruses like influenza do, that it will weaken & die out as spring and summer arrive. I’m wondering if masks have become difficult to get or crazy expensive on Maui? Even here in Iowa that seems to be the case."
I’ve heard that that mask shortage is world wide. I’m sure they are working on it right now.
"""Let’s just hope that this virus behaves as similar viruses like influenza do, that it will weaken & die out as spring and summer arrive. ""That's what Trump said he thinks will happen, possibly why he announced he is proposing slashing funding for CDC by 19% this week. Pay no attention to Singapore which has had 90 degree weather and an increase in cases.Edited: 8:16 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"Please Keep politics out of this forum. I could give you a ton of facts to contradict your opinion, but this is not a political forum and hopefully the person monitoring this will make sure you do not press your opinions any further.On another note, I believe everyone is praying for a way for our great scientists to find a solution to this terrible Virus."
And keeping religion out of the forums too right?The majority of masks don't work anyway. From what I have read that it spreads even before symptoms. I think it is here to stay.Good answer Steve :)
"""this is not a political forum and hopefully the person monitoring this will make sure you do not press your opinions""...""praying for a way for our great scientists""Can't make this ignorance up."
"LOL, *what* person monitoring the forum??????? Ain't such an animal or person.No religion please, either--I agree. ""Our"" great scientists happen to be surrounded world wide by *other great scientists*......many of who are better funded and better supported by their government. That's not politics, it's just a fact.Pattie, we don't know where he stayed but you aren't due to be here until April....................by then I bet Michigan has had its own cases."
We had a confirmed case in our state shortly after Christmas and it was at a major state university. We also are not afraid to travel because of this. Does no good to panic. Just take precautions and live your lives. Here is the CDC link if anyone wants any official info including what states/countries have confirmed cases.https:/…cases-in-us.html
"SW, Things may be heading toward the ""reset"" you have been hoping for (at least that is how I have interpreted some previous posts).*We also are not afraid to travel because of this. Does no good to panic.* I am not *afraid* to travel nor am I *panic*ing. But my reasoned judgment tells me now is a good time to avoid heavily trafficked places such as airports, cruise ships, and other major tourist destinations/attractions."
"I asked about the masks, not because I’m planning to use them or afraid to travel. It’s just interesting how people behave in a situation like this. This virus seems no more deadly than the normal influenzas we see every year. Yet lots of people are panicking. I agree that I wouldn’t want to be trapped on a cruise ship, but I always feel that way.Meanwhile, my family members who live in China have been in self imposed quarantine, hoping to get out and about as soon as they can. They got some masks at the beginning of this but would like more. They asked me to send them some at the beginning of this week & I found that it was next to impossible to get them here at home. They were shocked to hear that. As young healthy people they aren’t worried about the virus. Masks probably wouldn’t protect them, they are more to stop the spread from anyone who is infected. But they wouldn’t go out without a mask now because it just isn’t done there, people would be worried that they could spread the germs. Selfishly, I just want things to be back to normal by late June when our family from China plan to meet us on Maui and then return home with us. I’m thinking positively about that. Even if (cringe) it’s what our reality TV star in chief said too. Personally, I wouldn’t worry about viruses more than normally traveling to Hawaii right now. Several people on the Oahu forum are discussing canceling. I wonder if that means there will be last minute deals? I’d love to grab one for next month & get back again during whale season!"
"The man's wife has also been confirmed to have the virus. She has been hospitalized in Japan.We still don't know where they stayed on Maui.......but I also still say it's mostly irrelevant. People have been being exposed to this for well over a month--and there have likely been a number of cases that no one knew were Coronavirus.Pattie, there are several cases in Illinois, one in Wisconsin too.....so I'd be more worried about that if I were you in Michigan.California, Washington, Texas, Massachusetts, and Arizona also have **confirmed** cases. I'd bet there are many more.Luv, I don't know what the impact will be overall. I def have seen an increase of masks etc--but that's not surprising. We go through that every time there's a scare.....be it SARS, Dengue, etc."
"All I can see is that this is *news* becasue it is a new flu virus. So far, it appears to be half as deadly as our 'regular' flu, which has killed 14,000 people in the USA, out of 250,000 diagnosed since the start of 'flu season' in October. Aparently our 'regular' flu is nasty enough. In my limited sphere, it's hit mostly young people -- 102F fevers and severe body aches. ""Even my *eyes* hurt,"" is a common complaint. Tamiflu has helped shorten the duration. I understand avoiding travel and crowds during any flu season. I don't understand avoiding Hawaii or Chinatown due to discovery of a new flu virus. (Chicago's Chinatown is virtually empty of traffic.)"
"The 250,000 figures is not the number diagnosed. It is the number hospitalized. Diagnosed in US is estimated at 26 million. Mortality rate for novel coronovirus currently stands at 20 times that of influenza."
"Again, Sue---Coronavirus is FAR deadlier than the ""regular"" flu. Much, much more."
"actually CDC states they don't know yet if Corona is more deadly as the early stages of these virus always are skewed to the high side and historically as more people get infected many turn out be be milder cases and the severity tends to come down over time too soon to know at least according to CDCEdited: 1:10 pm, February 15, 2020 "
"Yes, John---we've been discussing that possibility too.However--at *this point* Sue's info isn't correct. It may come closer in ratio when more time has passed and more cases have been confirmed.I'm just waiting for Hawaii to get test kits....someday..."
"Sorry. I was using 'hospitalized' not 'diagnosed', but I doubt the new virus is more deadly. Consider where it originated; the general health of the population; the numbers of people never diagnosed who recovered. Media will always go for the most dramatic take. Regardless...it sure will put a crimp in every sector of the economy. I see that German automakers are not getting parts they need that are made in China.Edited: 2:58 pm, February 15, 2020 "
"We have 5 cases in BC already, 4 of those are in Vancouver. I wouldn’t be surprised if there are undiagnosed cases. I’d still be happy to go to Hawaii on a great deal."
"We always travel this time of year and I am always really careful in the airports, planes, restaurants, VRBO's, hotels, because it's flu and virus season. Whether it's flu A or B, other digestive or respiratory viruses or Corona, it makes no difference to me. I'll take the same precautions but still travel without living in fear like I always do. Unless the CDC is clearly advising me not to travel to a certain place I'm not stressing. Corona may or may not be deadlier than other common viruses. Most of us have a much bigger likleyhood of just catching something nasty and ruining our vacation by feeling like $hit the whole time. That's what I want to avoid and you don't need a virus fancier than the usual for that to happen!"
And then there is this...https:/…
"About 3 weeks ago I started a thread on this subject on the Vegas forum. Here's some info offered by a health professional on that forum.Just to be clear: Wuhan Coronavirus is ENTIRELY different from Influenza. Influenza is a specific virus that presents with numerous different strains. Wuhan Corona is a completely different virus (coronavirus instead of influenza) of which there are also many strains. This is a single strain of coronavirus that has presented itself. There is no clear indication at this point as to how it will play out long term or seasonally. But it has nothing to do with influenza. And to the best of my knowledge, at the current time, there isn't even any discussion about considering a combined vaccine."
"There are nearly 300 people on the Diamond Princess ship with the virus......all of them got it there, on the ship.Uninfected Americans are finally being flown to either California or Texas for 2 more weeks of quarantine tomorrow (Sunday)."
"Well...for our 15th visit I have always trusted the sage, non-political, comments and advice from AkamaiNick4SW. Looking forward to the Mahana on February 17th."
"Awww, how sweet of you!I certainly believe people should research and learn, before making decisions. Again--IF you are generally healthy, this shouldn't pose a major risk to you, even if you were to get it. That assumes you would seek medical attention promptly.I remember the first time I got pneumonia.....I was run down, left Maui to go back to winter in the mainland....stopped in the Sacramento area first and froze my okole off. Already had a bad cold. By the time I landed in Denver I was so sick I could barely stand up. Duh---totally MY fault.So use your heads and take good care of health and hygiene too......you could perhaps avoid this or many other illnesses!"
I was in Maui during that time. They should post where ge went in Maui
"Sure, they should. People who work where they stayed and all would like to know too...."
"Still no word on where they stayed on Maui. People are NOT happy about the lack of info and attitude from the State people..........Unfortunately, a woman from the Westerdam cruise ship tested positive (twice) after flying from Cambodia to Malaysia, a couple of days ago. I say that not just for her---but because thousands of people from the ship had already left Cambodia and/or Malaysia......very probably spreading the virus farther."
So guess I'll be washing my hands ALOT while in Maui next week! Weee!
"Good plan, Mike!!!! And do the same on the planes and in the airports........I think those are far higher risk than Maui (at least at this time).The couple that went back to Japan were on a Delta flight from HNL to Japan on Feb. 7th. No connection to Maui there. However--we still haven't learned where they stayed on Maui."
"Wasn't it just a few months ago that a study recommended not washing hands on airplanes? Maybe carry hand sanitizer (60%+ alcohol).Re: where the Japanese couple stayed on Maui, information released last Friday by Hawaii's Department of Health said “The individual had no symptoms while on Maui and was not contagious,"" so this may be why they feel there is no need to address this (not that I agree). Concerning that this does not match up with statements by the CDC on that same day that said asymptomatic transmission can occur.Good grief."
"Sorry---you are right, ""washing"" was a bad word.The State is ducking. I think it's a big resort that doesn't want them to publish it and is resisting. And the State is chickening out. That's WRONG. There have been enough cases from asymptomatic transmissions that the State is off base totally. Just the fact that his own wife got it is proof.....The State yesterday said they were not concerned about people who had ""casual contact"". That's a change. But still no honesty."
"Agree Hawaii authorities should be more transparent. Same goes for my state of California. If things really spring loose, we are screwed. I live in a rural area and generally do not encounter large crowds, public transit, etc., which is good. But my hair stylist, who I saw last week, was vacationing on Maui at the same time as the Japanese tourist. Not worried BTW. Just an example of precisely how viruses become pandemics. Indeed, wash your hands often. And here's one never mentioned, but get plenty of *SLEEP*."
"Yeah, but if you’re 65+, or like my little brother who’s going through chemo, you’re chances aren’t that good. If you feel sick, stay home; don’t be a dick and get someone killed by being inconsiderate."
"Christ, think about other people. Some people are immunodeficient and most likely will die because of inconsiderate thinking like that. You want to get sick or elderly people killed?"
"Bob, can you explain *who* your attacks are meant for?I have NEVER suggested people ignore this, or fail to get medical attention......and I don't think most other posters have either. In fact, I have specifically addressed issues like impaired immune systems and chronic illnesses.You may not realize that the individual ""reply"" button doesn't work like you expect. ALL replies go to the bottom of a thread."
"Please take precautions. Wear a mask if you’re sick and stay home. Stay hydrated, wash your hands, use hand sanitizer, avoid sick people, don’t travel if you done have to. Kids with cancer and senior citizens are the main at risk population. It’s up to the healthy population to protect them. Don’t get someone killed by being inconsiderate."
"If you are generally healthy and have no immune system issues, you will probably be fine. If you DO get sick, seek medical attention right away.I don't think anywhere in Hawaii will have ""huge"" precautions. They don't want to scare tourists. Some people and properties are def taking their own precautions but it's not like there is some organized mass effort. That's partially because they also don't think we have any cases......What concerns me is the growing evidence that this virus has a much longer period of infection than first thought--and that asymptomatic people are def capable of being contagious. Just today, 14 people thought to be negative weren't--from the cruise ship in Japan. They were segregated on the evacuation flight.We still have no test kits in Hawaii. All test have to be sent to the mainland and those are a four or five days turnaround. That's too long."

There is another Hilton owned property on Maui and I stayed there last week. A little transparency would be nice especially since one of my waiters had a cough......
There is the Waldorf Astoria Grand Wailea but it is not part of Hilton's timeshare program.
Thanks for the clarification Thomas! I’m freaking out a little less now :) Here’s to hoping they were creatures of habit
Pure conjecture at this point :)I have reservations at the Waldorf Astoria this week and am weighing options...
"They didn’t stay at Maui Bay Villas because it’s just being built and won’t be open for more than a year. From the website:Proposed – estimated opening, Q2 2021Thank you for your interest in this resort. Units are not available for sale at this time. Please come back soon for more information.Resort Not Bookable"
It was Ka’anapali Beach Club. https:/…
"Yep, finally confirmed it was KBC. For those who are unfamiliar with Maui----this is the old Embassy Suites property, in Honokowai, north of Kaanapali. It is a timeshare property that also operates like a hotel.Another news piece:https:/…Edited: 10:30 am, February 18, 2020 "
Had to do a double take for a second but we are staying south of Black Rock at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel......
"Yep, it gets mixed up a lot--and sometimes people even call it ""Kaanapali Beach Resort""......which gets really crazy, LOL.They are doing major cleaning there. Not a property I ever rec anyway--too many timeshare horror stories, LOL!"
I would also like to know where he stayed on Maui.
Please god let there be a pandemic in the US.
"Mary.....please look up to the older posts. The couple stayed at Kaanapali Beach Club.Long time no see, Kaeleku.....I thought maybe you were taking a trip to China, Iran, and Japan to bring back ""souvenirs"".........................."
"Actually I am on the mainland for a quick trip, surprisingly flights are still full."
"LOL Kaeleku. Now we have been warned to not be ""mean"" .Please clear the beaches for me."
"LOL.......TA hasn't warned me, did they tell you you were picking on people, TB4? Maybe some people just can't handle it when *each person* gets to post their own opinion?Kaeleku, I hear the hospital in Omaha and the one in Spokane have some specials on room stays.........and a free ""gift"" too.Edited: 3:57 pm, February 21, 2020 "

"Naw...I was referring to the self described unofficial moderators who decide what is ""nice"" and what isn't. That is exactly it... and sometimes the truth isn't fluffy..but it's the truth. Just ironic when I have pointed out thinking of others and I got dogged for that too. ???LOL Can't win but don't care.mmmm do you think if Maui does ever get it they can just line the hospital beds up along the beach?"
"Why no discounts on lodging yet? Hawaii resorts are crazy if they think they are getting full price or even booking at all in the next few months. Lot of empty hotels! Sad!Edited: 4:50 pm, March 05, 2020 "
Where are the empty hotels? Tourism was up in February from a year ago with Maui's percentage up the most. I suspect that when there is a case of the virus in Hawaii the hotels may start giving discounts. At this moment no one has tested positive.
"Fours Seasons Wailea has announced a deal :-).......though there aren't any confirmed cases yet.It's supposedly for Kama'aina (residents). I bet they'd match it for anyone. It's about 50% off.And actually...I am seeing a definite decrease of tourists here on Maui. Don't know about Kaua'i where fishdiva lives.Edited: 7:48 pm, March 05, 2020 "
It's landed in Denver this week. Two tourists who traveled from Italy thru DIA & got sick at one of the ski resorts. Several of their travel partners are under quarantine. Who knows how many people may have been exposed on the plane or in transit.
"You can stay home or you can travel...WHERE isn't going to make a whole lot of difference, as this spread is going to be worldwide."
"I can't believe my freaking luck... family was supposed to go to Mexico, last minute we switch to Hawaii thinking that it'd be safer and easier to return home if things get worse with travel bans etc.03/07 at dfw airport we book flights to HNL, and book .... yes you guessed it a room at the Grand Waikikian! No awareness of this case as it was like 2 hours before the flight out. 1 night at Courtyard before we can check in at HGVC. We stay till 03/15 and then go to Maui, we book The Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas for 1 night. In the morning the resort manager calls the room, says he has been informed by I believe DOH that a person confirmed with Corona was staying in the exact room were are in and had checked out 2 days prior. Incidentally there was another guest that stayed the night before us in the same room. As there were 2 full cleanings, it was deemed a low risk that we would contract it. There are no reports about a case involving this resort (there is one for the neighboring westin) but I do have the email from the manager at the resort to prove my statements, I'm kinda unhappy that it hasn't been mentioned, like someone is keeping the public in the dark.We're going into day 7 in the morning, nothing to suspect that we're positive but still a scary 2 coincidences!"
"That Nanea was involved has been posted many times and is also on media reports.Neither KOR or the Westin hotel have had any cases.Edited: 2:07 am, March 21, 2020 "
"That's where I disagree with you...On Thu, Mar 19, 2020 at 4:22 PM Ryan Nobriga wrote:Aloha Mr. Xxxxx, Thank you for your note and the opportunity to recap our discussion. As you will recall, we spoke on Monday, March 16th, the morning that I was informed that a previous guest who had stayed at our resort tested positive for COVID-19 after departing the resort. I do want to clarify that we did not have a guest that tested positive for COVID-19 at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas. Rather, as we discussed at the time, a guest that had previously occupied the villa that you and your family were in during your stay at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas later tested posted for COVID-19 after leaving our resort. In addition, there was another guest that had occupied the villa prior to your family checking in. As a result, before you checked in we had actually completed two full departure cleanings within the villa that you occupied while at our resort utilizing our enhanced cleaning protocols. Lastly, during our conversation, I also shared that, after outlining the facts and circumstances of this situation to a public health official, they deemed that anyone who occupied the villa after the guest who left and later tested positive for COVID-19, would be at low risk for contracting COVID-19. This is due to the fact that future occupants would not have had any direct contact with the original guest who tested positive after leaving the resort. I hope this assists you in advising your doctor about your situation here at the property. As far as the Westin Nanea property and “Marriott representatives” you noted, they were reporting about The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas, thus were not included in my email. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Sincerely, -Ryan"
And the email says exactly what I did :-).
I tried to edit my post but app sucks. Yes technically they can say he wasn't positive at the time he was at the resort but that isn't being straight up. Ask yourself how does this guest test positive just 2 days after leaving the resort? What compelled the guest to have the test? if it takes a couple of days for the test result he would have been just leaving the resort....
"Bars closed and restaurants offer only take-outs. :Many tourist attractions are shuttered. There is a 24/7 hotline phone to report violators. And some have been sent back. Medically, Hawaii does not seem to be equipped to handle their own residents, lacking PPEs in health care facilities. Maui county had a cluster**** at their hospitals with 39 health care workers and 14 patients positive. The health care workers had not been outfitted with proper preventive equipment and had not been allowed to provide their own cloth masks. There have been patients who were infected at the hospital. After that came out in the newspapers, masks were finally allowed/provided. Residents try not to go to the hospital for ""smaller issues"" out of fear? Distrust? People want to come here Now? To stay in your hotel room for 14 days? Save your money for another time when you will be able to go on boats to snorkel, whale watch, gamefish, dinner cruise, etc. When the kamaaina will be welcoming and healthy.. In the meantime, stay healthy and we will greet you all with much ALOHA later when the world gets a handle on this virus. MAHALO"
"Psssst..........you are months behind again.There are numerous threads about the closures, quarantine, etc. No one has posted otherwise for months now."
