I've noticed that Ethiopia is still operating flights to London at the moment. I was just wondering is Ethiopia open to tourists at the moment?
Yes its open for tourists but you must undergo 14 day Mandatory Quarantine in a hotel and you must pay for it. There is not much to do in Ethiopia as the country is in a 5 month state of emergency.
You are allowed to visit but as the previous poster said you would need to quarantine for 2 weeks at your own expense. Plus there are other covid 19 guidelines you would need to follow once there. I can't imagine it being much fun going on holiday anywhere at the moment.
"Source from the Ethiopian Ministry of Culture and Tourism....Starting from July 1st, passengers arriving at Addis Ababa airport in Ethiopia will have to take tests for coronavirus if they don’t do such tests 72 hours before their arrival in the country. Addis Ababa airport administration has created a diagnostic center at the airport, which receives most tourists. They will test guests who did not do tests in the past 72 hours before arriving in Addis Ababa.Precautionary measures have been implemented throughout the airport to maintain the health and safety of airport customers and staff. These measures include protective plexiglass at check-in and immigration counters, thermal and temperature screening, social distancing markers, and increased levels of sanitization in compliance with international standards set out by the relevant authorities."
"Fairr,According to your source, will the 14-day quarantine also be lifted on July 1, for those testing negative?Edited: 4:27 am, June 15, 2020 "
Hi thanks for the update however i can't find this information anywhere could you please post the link of the source. Thank you.
"Hello everybody,I've just read the message saying about the new Covid test. Do you know if Covid test negative allows you to don't do 14 days quarantine? Is it a true information?"
"Wondering the same thing, any news?"
Hi! Covid-19 testing for connecting flight lay over 2-3hours needed? This coming first week of july 2020.
"Ethiopia's rate of infections is much less than outbreak rates. Ethiopia has also encouraged production and other economic activities to continue during the crisis. Ethiopia never implements a national lockdown like most other governments, including in Africa. One of the reasons suggested altitude may compromise the virus’s life span, reducing its infectiousness. Addis Ababa 2300 meters above sea-level. Epidemiological analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic clearly indicates a decrease in prevalence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in populations living at an altitude of above 3,000 masl. The reason for the decreased severity of the global COVID-19 outbreak at high altitudes could relate to both environmental and physiological factors."
Warner..no tests needed for transit at Bole.
