Is it still closed ?
Yes. https://torreypine.org/
Partly. Torrey Pines State Beach is open.
Thank you ! Last week my friend that lives there drive past and thought they had opened it. I had googled it but didn’t know if the website had not been updated. Sorry - Madeline M if I wasted your time. Was not aware you lived in San Diego ? Was much more interested in hearing from some one who lived there.

What's the difference if someone lives here when the information is freely available on the park's website?
I suppose you would fly to New York to have a special dinner at Le Bernadine based solely on whether a website stated it was open? Seriously?

"Sure. Someone asked for advice from a local person who has actual knowledge of a situation and you stated that it shouldn't matter if someone wasn't local since a website said it was open. If you are relying on a website that may or may not have been updated, then you are not intelligent enough to be giving advice or posting."
"Clyde, it would help if you put your location down. Like Texas?"

"Like I said, welcome to the board after joining today. Not from Texa?. Pardon my mistake."
"Also, ""Clyde"", I don't have a problem with people from Texas. After all, All my ex's live in Texas."
I’m from Texas. And if the latest numbers are correct - about 1/3 of California is moving here! There may be more “Texans” posting soon ! lol

Like.
Darn must have missed another intelligent conversation with all of the deletes on this thread. I guess we should all lie for the elite minority that doesn't understand what being a responsible citizen during a world pandemic is. And is doing their part by keeping SARS- Cov-2 alive and deadly whether you're impacted or not.
"I guess you did miss it. I did too. I saw the ""like"" response from Miss Manners of California fly over country, and figured it was probably in response to someone like our Oregon or Texan flyover country, pandemic deniers.We probably didn't miss anything intelligent."
