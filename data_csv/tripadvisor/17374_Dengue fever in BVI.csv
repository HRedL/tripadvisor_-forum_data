"Just wondering how other potential travelers to Peter Island and elsewhere are dealing with this potential threat. Had been looking forward to a BVI trip in December-- some combination of islands in the BVI's-- but have been chastened by reports in the Times, from the CDC, etc about the recent steep rise in Dengue fever. Wish I could get a solid, accurate handle on this. Wondering what others are doing. Wondering, too, whether threat is same in USVI's (how could it not be?), but can't get clear answer on that either. Interested in all knowledgeable in-put. Thanks-- and safe travels to all."

"There have only been a handful of cases in the BVI & USVI recently. I lived in the BVI, year round, for 20 years and went through several outbreaks, but never contracted Dengue. My husband got it several years ago, and although it is pretty miserable, like a bad case of the flu, he was fine. Also, there has never been a case of Dengue hemmoragic in the BVI, and that is the only form of Dengue that a healthy adult should worry about. If you don't get bitten by mosquitos, you cannot contract Dengue, so use insect repellant, esp. during daylight hours, as this is when Aedes Egypti, the mosquito that carries the disease, feeds. The odds of contracting Dengue while on a short visit are extremely low. Use a good insect repellant with Deet and you will be fine. I would not let the extremely low odds of contracting Dengue stop me from going on vacation, it's not like we are talking about Ebola! You've got a better chance of catching the flu on the plane ride!"
"Your best bet, light insect coils at night to help steer them away, wear long pants and shirts in the evening and try and keep doors/windows closed to reduce it. It's more for the annoyance factor of getting bitten up which is just itchy. Been coming to the BVI for many years, staying months at a time, never contracted it either but have known some people who have, however it was nothing serious for them."
"Thanks for the responses. I've been going to the Virgin Islands for years also-- and have never worn insect repellent (though I'm usually very prone to mosquito bites). I think I'd forgo a vacation spot if it meant covering up with longs and longs, having to close up tight in the evenings etc. Caneel and Little Dix spray like crazy, I suppose (which, I know, is not great news for the environment). Other places we've stayed I guess it's been breezy enough, or maybe dry enough, that the buggers kept their distance. I'm only concerned because of the various reports on AP and other news outlets (including an article on the Virtuoso Travel web page) that the incidence of dengue is high this year. In our late 70's now, I'm not sure we have the resistance or the energy to fight off something as potentially serious as dengue. Am still trying to gather as much solid info as I can so I can make an informed decision. Thanks again to responders."
"My understanding of dengue is that it is *passed* by mosquitoes. Not only is it a specific type of mosquito (the aedes aegypti), the mosquito must first bite someone who is ""febrile"" (i.e. has the fever.) So, the potential for contracting it is higher in urban or densely populated areas.Since most tourists generally travel in ""tourist"" areas (i.e. rarely in the more densely populated ""local"" neighborhoods) and are probably not going to come in contact with ill residents, I think the risk is probably minimal.Having said that, I got dengue during my first trip to the BVI 15 years ago. I'd describe it as the worst flu I've ever had."
I live in BVI and two of my friends were diagnosed with dengue this week.
