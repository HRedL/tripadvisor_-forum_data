My daughter and I plan to be in Maui next week. At this point we are still planning to come but have accepted the fact that it may not happen. If we come I have a question. We are not staying in a resort on the beach we are staying in an Airbnb condo not on the beach. Wondering if the public beaches that we plan to go to if there are tiki bars or such to grab a fruity drink while sitting on the beach?
"While you can visit bars at any resort, you can't take liquor ""to go""."
"The resorts welcome visitors to eat, drink, shop. They will happily take your money. Open to the public. There are restaurants/bars that are not on resort properties (lots!) and of course ... and they are public.We have no idea where you are from ... but note that Hawaii is not like the Caribbean or Mexico. Very, very different.Please add your hometown, State or country to your profile. It's a big help!"
Thank you!! I updated my profile. A more clear question is can I lay on the beach and walk and get a fruity drink and go back with it to my beach chair? and if so can you give me some spots for this? Thank you!
"As I already said....NO, you cannot get liquor ""to go"" in Hawaii like that.Where are you staying?"
Lol. Sorry I thought if I asked again I would get a different answer. The address says Lahaina but it’s north. The condo is basically across the street from Kahana Beach resort in the beach house bar and grill.
"The Beach house is a good spot to enjoy some drinks and decent meals.........nothing really fancy but fine.Many people take coolers to beaches here. Alcohol is prohibited on the sand by State law. Many people ignore that. If you do, you could be cited or arrested if you make the wrong person mad.Many parks on the West side (where you will be) allow you to bring your own liquor.........but not to the beach.Edited: 8:34 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"While there may be bars somewhat close to the beach, you have to stay at the bar in Hawaii. There is no laying on the beach drinking allowed, such as the service you get in other areas (like Mexico) right on the beach. :)"
"Although, plenty of folks take liquor to the beach. There are discreet ways of having a nip at the beach. No glass. No falling down drunk and no cops patrolling the beaches looking for alcohol offenders. Generally speaking they have better things to do with their time.Just don't try to take a drink from a beachside bar to the sand. That will cause problems."
"And frankly, just cancel your trip and come after COVID-19 is a distant memory............PLEASE."
That’s easily said and not easily done due to a lot of circumstances you know nothing about. But thanks for your opinion.
"It's not easily said., and here are a few reasons why:I have many friends in tourism who will likely lose their jobs----and therefore might become homeless......plus from contact with infected tourists.I have friends who may lose their lives.....perhaps due to infections from people who just HAD to come here for vacation.I'm just asking people to consider the larger human picture. Please.Edited: 9:18 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"""There are discreet ways of having a nip at the beach.""Yeah, all those big plastic tumbler cups with straws are super discreet! Especially the bejewled ones that seem to be popular these days. :D"
