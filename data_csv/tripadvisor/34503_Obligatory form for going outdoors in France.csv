Buck T is a troll who has gone by other names on this forum. Best not to feed.
"The thing is, isolation won't 'make it over' because without a vaccine it will be with us indefinitely. The goal right now is to roll it slower so the hospitals can keep up but we are likely to either need to isolate for months -- not really ultimately tenable in a functioning society or realize tht everyone will have to get it sooner or later. rolling it slower lets hospital gear up with more ventiilators and supplies but without a vaccine there is no stopping it now."
"Janet — they are also stalling for the time to develop effective treatments for the most deadly effects of the virus. If they can address that until the vaccine comes out, we may have a summer."
To save a tree I am changing the date on the paper and going out again today.
Beaking News - The e-version of the form is no longer accepted. It has to be on paper. The minimum fine has also been set at €135https:/…

"Mrs just got an alert that there is no more bicycle allowed, walking and jogging okay."
"Time for a push-bike (as we call them here) protest - I'd support you ATF! A mass ride - all at least 1.5 metres apart, of course, with your attestation on a lanyard around your neck."
"People are no longer allowed to run more than 2km, and it must be in proximity to their domicile. I don't know if they have a police officer measuring the distance..."
"What if you run a kind of circuit, backwards and forwards - and run up, say, 10K?"
"GRA a pushbike protest would garner multiple fines as all Parks, Gardens and Forests are now closed and forbidden.Ironically my last bike ride in the forest yesterday I managed to infect a bat."
Apparently ya can't reuse the paper by scratching out the previous day's date. A friend got controlled on the highways twice today. The cop didn't want to see the paper or even go near the car window. My friend just had to yell out the window the reason for being on the road.
"Yes, I know that you are not supposed to change the date, even though I did it twice. I figured that in the early days I would just get off with a warning if they checked it, but I was never checked. Anyway, I printed half a dozen forms and I will use a new one next time.The fines have been skyrocketing, and some people were even locked up overnight -- young jerks who were checked more than once and who came back to the same place 10 minutes later. Ah, the defiance of youth! Too bad for them -- the fine can be increased to something like 2000 euros in such a case."
"I have been using the same form every day, with the date written in pencil, so I can change it as needed. I have not yet been checked."
"Twinkie, if you get in trouble, don't say that I didn't warn you that no form is valid in France unless completed in black or blue ballpoint pen."
"Kerouac, I know! I have filled in the form in black ink, except for today's date. I will no doubt end up in jail."
Why not use erasable black or blue ink pens?
"Now my rant : Whoever had the idea of a form anyway? If the police stop me what difference does it make if I simply tell them where I am going and why as opposed to writing it myself on a piece of paper? The answer would be the same in both cases. The one thing I have always had difficulty coming to terms with in France is some of its ridiculous bureaucracy. The attestation currently needed is a prime example of this.Edited: 3:44 am, March 21, 2020 "
"I disagree completely. Obliging people to fill out a form before going out makes them think about whether they really need to go. In normal times, people go out and wander at random very often with no real purpose. This makes them take responsibility."
"Hey cliu - what about a magic slate...remember...you write on a plastic overlay and then lift it to erase what was written?It saved the members of the US Iran embassy during the siege - perfectly secure communication.Tradeform - it's about intention. Declare. Perform the task. You can't b-s the officer with a ""just going down there"" when you are pulled up. Pretty smart system really. Because it is simple and readily verifiable. So not the usual French bureaucracy."
"That’s a really good point Kerouac. Just today I was thinking I don’t really need more bread, I don’t really need to go out. So, I’m not.I’ve been re-writing the date on my hand written form. And I’m carrying my passport when I go out too. I’ve not been stopped. Seems pretty obvious to me that if you have bags on the Rue de Bretagne, you’re food shopping. I’m old enough to not be confused with a silly teen with too much time on their hands. People in my small Marais bubble seem to be really getting it. Few people out for supplies and a few obviously at work. Virtually no cars. Loads of people with wine and or a book sitting in their windows these past couple of beautiful days.People keeping their distance. No one’s had to tell us to go in one at a time at the boulangerie, but we’re all doing it.Edited: 5:14 am, March 21, 2020 "
I know the form is saving the police a lot of time. They don't have to bicker with people who don't have the form but who have outlandish reasons for being outside -- they just give them a fine. This is particularly useful in the suburbs where there are all of those young men whose principal occupation is to hold up the walls of their building.
"Is the date changing on the form something engrained in our collective Mobilis minds or is it officially on the web somewhere. Some friends are using white-out to write over a new date. Used ink cartridges, and more paper trash because why.."
"I use erasable ink.If erasable ink was not specifically invented for the French, then who else?"
My printer is broken so having to hand write a form each time is a real pain. The first 2 days I had it on my phone then heard it was not acceptable.
"They were stopping people in our village yesterday. Some friemnds of our sere stopped on the way back from the supermarket, and although they both had forms they received a telling off, because ""it doesn't take two people to go to the supermarket"". At the same time Mrs Wiz wasn't stopped because they saw she was aloneThe big problem is that people still aren't taking the lockdown seriously, so the rules are getting more and more restrictive. Yesterday I was allowed to go 2km from home, now I am only allowed 2km from home on proper roads - all white roads, walking tracks , river banks and the like are out of bounds.If people keep taking the mick there will be a complete shutdown, with timetabled departure from home, and list of approved residents of each building.Edited: 7:05 am, March 21, 2020 "
In Paris we can only go 400 meters in most cases.
My heart breaks for you guys. Please know that you are in the thoughts and prayers of those of us who are still lucky enough to enjoy many of the freedoms we have previously taken for granted. Stay well.
"missmarleygirl, Thank you. That's really kind, but actually I am glad that we are so restricted now. In Paris, I went out today to buy provisions, and it struck me for the first time that this is very grave. People were taking social distancing seriously, and wearing masks. And very few people out and about."
"If you have no printer, and no paper, and you are unable to hold a pen and write legibly, you have a problem. And every contact with anyone is a possible transmission vector for the virus, which rather defeats the purpose of isolating people if they must come into contact with the police."
"** To save a tree I am changing the date on the paper and going out again today. **ATF, I will tell on you :-)"
"The two cops telling me the forest was closed stood side by side shoulder to shoulder with no protection. Similar to any other government authorities you see on TV they stand or sit side by side without protection or distance. Another friend that can't work from home has been controlled multiple times says no pencil, no white-out (wite-out in this reality) and 1 new form each day to go to work. The cops actually want drivers to scotch tape the form to the window."
Taping the paper to the window would not be enough since they're also supposed to check your identification papers.
Your ID is to be held up against the window.
"Well then you can do both at the same time without wasting cellophane tape.I am feeling a bit left out, because not only have I not been checked yet but I haven't seen any police except for those passing by in their vehicles."
Facebook video of a happy driver being controlled with the appreciated effort of window distancing: https://tinyurl.com/vjkmbmyUnfortunately the two cops infected the camera person..
"There is a new form, with a couple of very specific additional reasons for leaving home.https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-a…"
The most important new element is writing the time of departure from one's domicile.
Still no requirement for a photo the size of a US postage stamp from 1978.
