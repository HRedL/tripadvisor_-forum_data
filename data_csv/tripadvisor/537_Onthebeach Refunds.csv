"Dear All Has anyone experieced the refund process from onthebeach at all please?My holiday, like everyones has been cancelled and I am being refunded but I am curious to know if this takes a long time?Any experiences welcomed :).Kindly"
Lots of posts on this in forum.Copied this from one of them:Those who have asked for a refund and not received a response have emailed the CEO of Love Holidays... Alex Francis.alex@loveholidays.com and he has not responded. So clearly there is something dodgy/underhand going on.If you have booked a holiday with Love Holidays it has been ATOL and APTA bonded and you ARE legally entitled to a refund.Do not be fobbed off with a voucher. You ARE entitled to a refund!.
"Hello Sally-AnnCan't speak for On the Beach but I suspect all holiday companies are in the same dark hole at the moment.We were cancelled by TUI on 17th March just hours before we were due to fly and have yet to see a penny of our £3900 refund.We have also had a trip to Palma in May cancelled by Jet2 about a week ago but no further communication has been forthcoming. Needless to say, getting through via the phone is impossible and emails remain unanswered."
"Thank you for sharing, much appreciated. Indeed vouchers are unacceptable, I can’t justify 5,200 of vouchers, and another trip booked for August already. Wish I paid by instalments now not in advance! Too much saving for a voucher!Thank you"
"Yes my flights were TUI also, so I am mindful that my refunds will come in 2 parts, flights and then the hotel.It certainly does not inspire me to book in advance in the future! Kindly SA"
I booked with sunshine holidays I think stevie g on another post said it’s same company. I had my hotel and transfer refunded 775 but 2100 flight with tui nowhere to be seen
"Yes as Natalina said, we were due to go 30th March. OTB have refunded the hotel but still owed £4000 off the TUI flights. Not heard anything since the hotel was refunded."
"It look like we are all in the same boat! They are apparently paying back in date order, so if March payments not made April will take a while yet!Its just so much money! They are so quick to take, slow to return. Gggggrrrrr!!Edited: 4:54 am, April 18, 2020 "
"... and yet, as I have already commented on several threads, we received the refund for our March holiday exactly 5 days after our due departure date of March 18th. TUI sent a cancellation email on March 16th (we had already decided to abort 2 weeks beforehand but had delayed actually cancelling) and the cash was back on my card on March 23rd. I am now fairly certain that this was because we had booked through Hays Travel and it was therefore Hays whom we had paid and Hays who actioned the refund. I have no idea if they were out of pocket from TUI at the time or indeed whether they still are but if ever there were a case for booking through a high street agent this seems to be it."
"Yes Wid, with the benefit of hindsight you are probably right that in this instance you made the right call by booking through a travel agent who presumably has done the rigth thing and reimbursed you themselves.I read in today's paper that hundreds of people are still awaiting refunds from a number of holidays, TUI amongst them.We still wait, and hope TUI are cash rich enough to weather the storm and reimburse us.Edited: 12:20 pm, April 18, 2020 "
I do hope so and wish you luck ...again. I know you were due to go about the same time as we were and I had expected you to be refunded just as quickly as we had been. Sadly this proved not to be the case and I feel for you and everyone else in the same boat. It urks me hugely that people who are now furloughed have been made to feel grateful to be offered vouchers when the cash refund would have greatly helped their current situation. I too hope TUI survives even though I haven't been a fan of theirs for quite a few years. If the tourist trade is to recover it needs them as does the global economy.
"I think you got lucky early on Wid. I seen on FB someone was saying they are going to try and sue Hayes because they were told they might have to wait 12 months. Tbf it’s not the agents fault, the airlines are purposely dragging there heals."
"Easyjet have changed online so you can request a refund or voucher or change booking.At last, they've set this up online."
#12Stevie - Do you mean Hays Travel or Hayes? They are two completely different companies.
"Hi Wid, I’ve just checked it is a Hayes travel holiday with TUI flights (through Hayes travel).Looking at Hayes travel FB page though looks like they have really good customer service and is probably the only travel FB page I’ve seen that’s not full of negative comments.Anyway I think it’s unfair for any blame to be put on the agents as it would be unreasonable to expect them to pay out without having a refund off the airline. I’m with OTB and while the communication has disappeared since I’ve had my hotel refund (it would be nice to be updated) I accept the airlines are holding back (especially TUI it would seem) and it is them creating delays."
"Tui making it even harder to get refunds, wanting customers to help!https:/…"
Hayes travel? Hays Travel has no 'e' That's why I asked whether you meant the other company which does.
Was booked to Costa del sol 22nd March through LH had refund for hotel and transfers over a week ago. Waiting for the thieves Ryanair to refund flight to LH. If not forthcoming il lodge at Northampton court to claim back from Ryanair.
They're all breaking the rules not giving refunds and giving credit vouchers or holding onto peoples money and taking months to refund!Martin Lewis now talking to CAA.https:/…
Totally agree. Not my words but customers complaining!!I've had mine rebooked so I'm happy.It's for others on here saying no refunds yet
"“This is expected due to huge Demand and less staff working...”OK but, if the company paid everyone who wanted a refund (as opposed to a postponement or a voucher) on a reasonable schedule, they would probably have to file for bankruptcy a couple of days later.Delays rightly aggravate those waiting for refunds but the bean counters would prefer to annoy customers and keep the cash flow flowing than see the company go under."
"Finally got my refund from TUI this morning, so it looks like they are slowly working their way through the refund requests, presumably in date order. Mightily relieved."
That's great news. A relief for you!
Have any refunds been paid yet because I have just had my holiday cancelled and some kinda time scale would be nice from onthebeach but they tend not to reply to emails.
"They can be quick, but majority of the time very slow. They're dealing with lots wanting refunds so they're taking a long time. I rebooked mine so not lost out or got refund.I'd hate to think of how many agents and airlines will be left after all this. Not many if everyone wants refunds :( Let's hope we can all get through this and still have holidays abroad :)"
I want to book another holiday but I think it's a little earlier to know when this will be safe to do.
"I rebooked for next March, as i can always change that, as stated in their terms. Easyjet are the same, changed some flights knowing i can change again if needed. They're all being more flexible now."
"Trying to deal in a timely fashion with the influx of customers wanting refunds must be an absolute nightmare for all the airlines and tour operators. It has however been undoubtedly made a lot worse by so few of them working over the years within a policy of holding customers' money in escrow. Things need to change in the future so that when some other crisis rears its head within the industry the money they have already received from the punters is still available in the coffers for repayment if required.Edited: 3:44 am, May 08, 2020 "
"You are of right, of course, Wid but I fear the tone of lobbying that ABTA is making to the government is the polar opposite of this insofar as they are seeking to enshrine in law a far greater period of time before refunds need to be paid.My personal perception is that gradually the holiday companies are getting to grips with the refund issue.I got my refund from TUI last week for my 17 March holiday to Hurghada and yesterday received a full refund from Jet2 for an upcoming trip to Palma due to take place 15th May. This was completely unprompted and a very pleasant surprise.Edited: 4:57 am, May 08, 2020 "
IvorI'm really happy that you have finally received your refunds. You were due to travel the same time as we were and I remember being baffled by TUI's delay in handling yours when they were so efficient and quick with ours. The cash was back on my card 5 days after the holiday was cancelled.

"Lucky you, I am still waiting! My holiday was booked for April - fully paid. Also for August but this is not yet cancelled - but have not desire to travel yet. I do wish OntheBeach or TUI would provide an update, it seems like a 3 months waiting list for repayment!"
"Have to say jet2 have been brilliant, was going to Rhodes in June and got a full refund on Friday just wish jet2 would do holidays in Egypt"
"Hi hun.... we was due to fly 29th May to hurghada holiday was Cancelled in April within a week we got the hotel and transfer part... but still waiting for £2,989 for flights OTB are no help what so ever all you get is a snotty message, as I stated they are quick to chase us if we pay in instalment and miss yet when comes to them paying they don’t answer emails now and phone calls well don’t get me started!!! All I’ve got is tui won’t pay then so they can’t pay us..... and got a link in the email sending me to the ins and outs of refunds which tripped them up as stated “refunds are legally bounded to be paid within 14days” if this isn’t possible THE BOOKING AGENT IS BOUNDED TO GIVE YOU A CLEAR TIME FRAME IF NOT DATE AS TO WHEN THIS WILL BE PAID! We always book in full, so as well as no holiday like so many of us we are still lying g interest on something that hasn’t happened and that we are owed! OTB YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED !"
"MrsM, I’m afraid you might have a long wait. We was supposed to travel 30th March and still getting the same BS response off OTB when I chase them for an update."
Thank you very much x
Finally from 30th March we got our refund today!
"Thats encouraging!! You must be thrilled, super pleased for you. So if your holiday was March and mine was meant to be April then perhaps another 2 months to wait for me..x"
I had an email tonight saying OTB would pay the refund ‘out of their own pocket’ and they would fight TUI for the refund of the flights as long as I can confirm I’ve not gone direct to the airline for a refund and I will assist OTB in their battle with TUI if required. We were also travelling 30th March
Natalina I assume you got the same email? I hope I can use the £100 voucher on a future holiday I have already booked.
I booked with sunshine and just had the odd email over the 3 months asking me to be patient and once tui paid up they would refund me my flight cost and then I got one on the 1st July saying £2152 is ready to be refunded and to log in and press collect and it went straight in the bank.
"@Hi Stevieg4785 and colleguesYes I also revieved the email on Friday, much to my joy. I see the a refund issued and now waiting for it to go into account - Yay! Now waiting to see if my August holiday is cancellend - don't want to cancel and not planning going on a holiday (I have a long standing kidney issue that requires dialysis every 4 weeks and not want to take a risk).Thank you all for your advise and support :). Keep Well and safe."
I’ve booked with On The Beach to travel in June to hugada luckily I paid with a credit card I could not contact them by phone so I placed A section 75 notice and the credit card company refunded my payments but this took eight weeks I have now with a new travel agent £70.00 cheeper with hotel upgrades leaving 09 September.
