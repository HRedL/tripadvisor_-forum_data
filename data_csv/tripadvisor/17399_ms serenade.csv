does any one know how many passengers the ms serenade takes on board please ?
"I think it has about 58 cabins so, in theory, if each was occupied by two people, it could carry 116 people. As to how many have actually been on it in recent times only recent travellers can say.."
"Having cruised on the MS Serenade I was going to say around 100, but SWmuse has beat me to it by seeking out the actual number of cabins the Serenade has.There have been recent reports of Nile cruise boats of this size sailing with only a dozen passengers onboard at the moment, due to the very low number of tourists visiting Egypt right now."
"We were on this boat last week and it was full, we came home yesterday and it was full again this week I think they are doing very cheap deals for us Brits, It is a good boat if you want to cruise the Nile it is very clean and they are very helpful ALL the men who work on it are perverts they ask you to kiss them when your husband is out of ear shot but just take no notice of them."
"Instead of an epidemic of perversion, I think you simply encountered the everyday self interest of tip-seeking crew members each of who was hoping to earn some bonus overtime as a gigolo."
