Good true article.
Im keeping an open mind on the zero death toll. 9-10 other countries have had a similar number of reported cases but have all had about 7-10 deaths. Zero is still possible I suppose.
"Vietnam's response to the Covid 19 pandemic appears to be quite impressive compared to the response by Western countries, especially the UK.Vietnam's response to the initial outbreak of Covid 19 was ""swift and decisive"" Such decisive and firm action is possible in a one party authoritarian state like Vietnam, but would not be possible in western democracies.Even if the number of cases in Vietnam has been under reported it is clear that Vietnam has been more successful in managing the crisis than most countries.In view of what Vietnam has achieved I cannot forsee any lifting of the suspensions of Tourist Visas / ""Visa Waivers"" in the near future as Vietnam will be desperate to prevent and/or limit a second wave of the virus.I cannot see Vietnam wishing to possibly ""import"" cases of Covid 19 from other countries, such as the UK, where the outbreak is far from being under control.Stay safe !Edited: 9:54 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Lots of lessons other countries could learn from Vietnam in the above article, in responding to a coronavirus pandemic.Maybe too late for the current outbreak but many lessons as to how a future outbreak or ""second wave.""could be managed.Stay safe !Edited: 11:00 am, April 25, 2020 "
Here in Hanoi (the place with the highest number of covid cases in VN) much of the town is still locked down while the rest of the country has been opened up. No borders will be opened for quite a while.
"Latest talk on travel could see the introductions of ""immunity passports"" China is reportedly looking at them. Still a lot to be worked out yet."
"Hi !The WHO has recommended AGAINST introducing ""immunity passports""Stay safe !"
"Good article, thanks, JD.And the mentions of transparency in handling the pandemic are nicely complemented by the article linked by Happy Travellers. I recall PM Phuc, early in the epidemic, exhorting the ministries, and city and provincial governments to be transparent in their decisions, communications, reporting. Otherwise, he said, it would come back to bite them. A lesson was learned from the 2016 marine pollution crisis.Within that text are links to other articles. One, by a Frenchman, Jean-Noël Poirier, hospitalised in Hanoi, is well worth reading.https:/…Also nice to find sites which have placed pandemic news outside their paywalls. Regardsrayza"
