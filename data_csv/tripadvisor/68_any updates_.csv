"Hello, are there any updates on Turkey returning to normal? due to travel to Belek 1st October and our balance is due next Month (jet2)Im just wary of paying the full balance if there are going to be restrictions in the hotel when we get there. or if the hotel is not opening to full capacity. if pools/entertainment will be limited or even out of bounds! its a lot of money to spend if we aren't getting the full experience.any information would be appreciated :)"
"Am hopeful by October a lot more will be back to normal but cannot guarantee itthe hotel we are visiting in August is capping sales of rooms once they reach 50% capacity, kids clubs closed and entertainment reduced - so you are not guaranteed the full experience if travelling in the near future."
"thanks for the reply. a lot of the hotels over there have a number of on site restaurants. im also wondering; if they reduce capacity, will all the restaurants be open. where are you staying? we are staying @ rixos premium."
"The restrictions are going to remain in place for as long as the virus presents a significant risk, they may be lightened somewhat if the situation improves but there again if the situation worsens they may become more drastic. The figures coming out of Turkey at this moment suggest cases are rising, I personally cant see things being relaxed until this situation improves."
"Antalya is one of the provinces where mask wearing is not compulsory BUT the list of those where it is was added to overnight. The fine for non compliance has been increased to 3000 lira. Seeing some of the photos coming out of Antalya and those totally ignoring social distancing etc. I am sure restrictions will be reintroduced fairly soon.No one has any idea what is happening tomorrow or next week let alone by October....Edited: 6:30 am, June 18, 2020 "
Rixos have issued the follwing Covid-19 Protocol...https:/â€¦RH_Covid_19_EN.pdf
"Robertop I very much doubt the U.K. government will lift the travelling for tourism advice while there are still a lot of restrictions. If there is 14 day quarantine on return I doubt tourist flights will be operating either. The flights that have resumed between U.K. and Turkey are for essential travel with loads of conditions e.g mask wearing, all cabin bags in the hold a corona test on arrival in Turkey with a 3 hour wait before proceeding to passport control...... These are not for those visiting as tourists."
"Interesting document, no doubt a standard has been set and other hotels will be adopting similar methods and routines. However and what does stand out is that it makes no mention of the procedure the hotel will follow and what will be expected from guests should someone staying there actually develop symptoms. I am thinking back to what happened in Tenerife when around 1000 guests were locked into their hotel following an outbreak.The cynic in me is saying the emphasis is on the positives and inspiring confidence but at the same time the potential negatives are being kept low key."
