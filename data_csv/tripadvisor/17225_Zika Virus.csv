"19 hours ago they are stating that PR is bracing for its own zika epidemic, does anyone know if it is still safe to travel there?"
"I'm not trying to be rude but there are 2 posts right below yours on the same subject. If I was concerned about the virus I would speak to a doctor or go to the cdc website but that's just me. Mosquitoes are dangerous with or without zika, wear deet."
"The problem is places are not either ""safe"" or ""unsafe."" It is just not binary, unfortunately. Instead, there is a spectrum of risk. That is true for traveling to Egypt or Namibia or the Bronx or Puerto Rico. They all have some risks associated with them. And yet most people who travel to these places do just fine. People who say the zika thing is all hype don't know what they are talking about (or they do, but they are lying). It is not all hype. It is a real infection, which can have consequences at least for some people, and it is a legitimate concern. On the other hand. most people who travel to Puerto Rico will have a good time and will not get zika. And many who do get zika will probably never even know it. So you have to figure out how much you want to go, and what your risk tolerance is. If you do not want to take ANY chance at all of zika, you should not go - because the odds are more than zero percent that you will get it. (Then again, if you stay home you might die in a traffic accident, so it is hard to achieve zero risk).For me, I have decided to go. I am not pregnant or immunocompromised and I plan to use mosquito spay. If I were pregnant or immunocompromised, or could not afford mosquito spray, I might make a different decision. But we each have to make our own risk calculations."
Weird I didn't see any of the subject lines right below mine about the virus. Why even respond? Just pass my post and let the people who have legitimate info respond. Thank you.
"Yes, you are very right...that is a good way to look at it. I appreciate you taking the time to respond. Have a great trip!"
"I said that you should wear repellent, consult a doctor and the cdc website. I thought that was helpful information."
"There is zika in Florida.Zika is a very very very mild illness. No one goes to the doctor. Only people at risk are those pregnant because of the risk of birth defects. So unless you fall on that group there is nothing to worry about. Right now, we are more concerned about influenza than dengue, chikunguya or zika.Wear repellent at night/sunset. Cover your skin. But that is to protect you from the other stuff mentioned, not zika.Also, use the search function. There are a few recent threads on this subject.Edited: 4 years ago "
"I live in Puerto Rico. We've had Zika cases for quite a while now. So far, I haven't met someone's who's had it, and I have contact with 200+ people every day. To minimize risk, wear long sleeves and trousers in light colors. Try not to be outside in parks, beaches or anywhere there's water in the evening. Wear a good repellent such as Off! Deep Woods VII (bring your own as it's very difficult to purchase here). There are plenty of places you can visit and have a good time. I'd be more concerned about going to Michigan with all their lead in drinking water problems!"
Thank you.
"I typed in zika and found one from Jan 19th. And if you google zika virus San Juan, PR there are quite a few very recent articles citing it to be a clear issue there. I posted just to get some advice and different perspectives from people traveling there. Thank you everyone for the info."
"@nytoparis said ""No one goes to the doctor.""Therein lies the problem ... Since the virus _is_ mild, people don't bother with going to the doctor (most of us have already dealt with Dengue or CHIKV). So the number of reported cases on the island is UNDER-reported."
"Plenty of repellent in PR, no need to bring your own. Unless you are checking bags anyway.It is really not an ""issue"". It is the ""new kid on the block"", hence all the attention. Last year it was chikunguya. The year prior it was dengue. I think all the PR forum regulars are becoming experts :)Edited: 4 years ago "
"Okay, thank you:) I'm packing plenty of bug repellent as well. We are going to be there for 5 days, staying in isla verde. Would you recommend renting a car or are restaurants, bars etc close enough to walk to or get a taxi to?"
See this link:www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/united-states.htmlFlorida 59 casesTexas 34 casesPuerto Rico 259 cases
Thank you :)
"Yes, Isla Verde has plenty of restaurants within walking distance of most hotels. You may consider renting a car if you are going to El Yunque Rainforest or any other attractions outside the San Juan area. Tours are also plentiful at any tour desk. Old San Juan should really be enjoyed by foot to appreciate the beauty and history of this historic gem."
"Taino,Are you sure you posted in the correct post?"
"Daniellem, rent a car for day trips out of SJ."
Something looks strange.NY did you mean to post that here?
Dolphin- The OP came back and asked if they should rent a car or are there restaurants and bars close by... Why would that look strange? And then NY answered about renting a car...... Nothing strange here.
"Yep your right, I see it was in a string on page 2 and I did not see it.Thought my computer was dying."
I was trying to reply to post #12. Hopefully the OP saw it.
cancelled our trip. i wouldnt go.
i heard a cruise ships people say they got the noro virus from the water in P.R. and the zika virus is terrible.
Get a clue. The water in PR is better than the water back home. In fact it is. Maynard is not in compliance to the EPA water standards. You better move quick....Edited: 4 years ago 
"Viral infections that you get on a cruise have nothing to do with the water, but with hygiene. Plus, a cruise does not collect water in PR, then reuse it.Zika is terrible? How so?Sorry you cancelled your trip out of misinformation."
New news out from NBC news 9 hours ago so let's say noon on 3/23.These are two reporters going around San Juan talking about Zika.I believe there are 3 videos of 2 minutes each.Plus the article.There is nothing new with the numbers but one video is shot in the CDC Dengue lab.Note this is not the CDC Zika lab as that is under clearance security only.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rico-health-w…
"There are several responses to your original post that sound like people in the travel business so beware. Not just because they're dim and rude, but because they don't know what they are talking about. A larger concern is the person from Puerto Rico who says to stay a way from the beach. I agree with her that there are dangerous places everyplace (Michigan) but why go to Puerto Rico to stay away from the beach?"
"Only one of the regulars commenting on this post is in the travel business, and that person regularly gives excellent advice. The person from PR mentioning not going to the beach gave incorrect info. Mosquitos breed in standing fresh water, ot on salty moving ocean water. So no reason not to go to the beach. Also, Deep Wood repellent is much stronger than needed for mosquitos. Those are used mostly for ticks. Plus the level of DEET in those is potentially dangerous."

"Hi Everyone, due to travel to San Juan in three weeks & honestly i am dreading it. Can someone give real advice of experiences of how bad it is out there. We have sought medical advice & are being told that should delay our trip if can."
"What do you mean how bad?Zika is a mild disease. If you are pregnant or trying to, stay home. Otherwise, I do not understand why you would be worried. Wear repellent if you must, but for dengue or chikunguya. Zika is a non-issue."
I know that some say Zika is a non-issue but that's not what the CDC and NIH are now saying. I wouldn't change my travel plans because of Zika but everyone should stay well informed. Zika virus 'scarier than initially thought - from CDCcnn.com/2016/…index.html
"The article talks about pregnant women and those planning to get pregnant (including partners) so nothing new.It mentions the number of cases in the continental US, which is the same as in all caribbean US territories. So the rate in the continental US is higher than in PR."
How is it there in June coming down the first week ? Are there more mosquito this time year ?
"No, not many more mosquitos"
It depends on the amount of rain we get.
