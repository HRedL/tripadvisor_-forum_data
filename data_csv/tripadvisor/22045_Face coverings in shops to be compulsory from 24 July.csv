Is this the worst government ever?
"Applies to all of England, not just London."
"Perhaps the Government should have made it masks on when the non essential shops reopened, not this way aroundMichael. The English border starts at Watford according to some"
Is this the worst government ever?———————————————————————Quite possibly. I’m pleased they have such a great grasp of the science that they know there’s no need this week but will be by the 24th. Genius. Only on Sunday it wasn’t necessary as we all had common sense and courtesy ( my old school motto). Things move quickly.
"And shops staff do not need to use the face mask? That's one of the most stupid guidelines I've ever heard.My view is, the face masks usage should be people's choice, not compulsory.Edited: 3:32 am, July 14, 2020 "
"If staff are behind a screen or isolated in some way I can understand why they wouldn't need a face covering. I would wxpect them to wear mask if walking the floor, stacking shelves etc. This has been my observation so far. Happy to wear something for the relatively short period of time I am in a shop."
This could make trying on lipstick interesting .....
"It's supposed to make people more confident about shopping. I'm afraid it will have the opposite effect on me. Shopping in the high street up to now has been a pleasurable experience - few people, little to no queues at the till. Indeed, I'll be walking into the city centre in an hour to pick up a few things. But that will be the last time, and I'll revert back to shopping online. Masks are a hindrance for people who wear glasses. I've tried different masks and techniques, but there is just no effective way to stop them steaming up when moving between cool and warm temperatures."
If I wear a mask I find it more likely that my glasses will steam up as opposed to when I use a scarf or similar covering.
"My wife and I are already wearing a face covering when shopping and have done for some time.Someone said that putting a twist in the elastic straps on face masks can help reduce misting glasses. Not tried it ourselves, anyone know if it works?"
"I’ve had no problem wearing a mask, even for long periods of time. Rinsing my glasses with shampoo prevents steaming up. I’ve had a virus (not the virus) and have been very wheezy for several weeks. Wearing a mask hasn’t made that worse. I experimented with several different kinds of mask: cotton, bamboo, synthetic etc until I found the sorts which I found most comfortable. Problem solved."
I’ve been wearing a cotton mask for various things for a couple of months now. I’m a lifelong glasses wearer but the misting isn’t too bad. I find it quite doable for shopping for a limited period. I never want to shop for more than a limited period anyway.
">> It's supposed to make people more confident about shopping. I'm afraid it will have the opposite effect on me.

But that will be the last time, and I'll revert back to shopping online. <<Totally agree that this won't have the intended impact - if someone is already very worried about the possibility of catching the virus then the site of town centres full of people wearing masks is unlikely to make them feel confident about going out, and those who aren't unduly concerned about it will see the mask-wearing as a hassle and choose to shop online instead. I'll wear a mask when I absolutely have to (I haven't been doing it up until now as I do my food shopping first thing in the morning when there's next to nobody in the supermarket), but for me this is a deterrent to going out and shopping on the high street, not an encouragement.I also can't get my head around rules that say customers must wear a mask or be fined, but shop staff don't need to - isn't the point supposed to be that if we all wear masks we're protecting each other? Why is it my responsibility to protect fellow customers and staff, but not the staff's responsibility to protect customers and each other...?There's also the obviously illogical position of making people wear face coverings in shops where they have little interaction or close contact with other people, but it's okay to sit in a pub a metre or so away from a table full of total strangers without anybody wearing a mask. There were always going to be contradictions and nuances as the lockdown restrictions were lifted, but it really feels like the government has bungled dealing with them at every turn."
""" it's okay to sit in a pub a metre or so away from a table full of total strangers without anybody wearing a mask.""I don't think it is meant to be like that, theoretically. In practice then....."
I know some people don’t like it but it’s just another thing we will all have to get used to in this ‘New normal’. A large chunk of the rest of Europe have had mandatory face coverings since the Spring in public places so belatedly (as always seems to be the case with this government) we are just falling in line with everyone else.
"Kernewes, Mr bestcornish is hearing impaired and also finds it difficult, so praise where it’s due. Peter Jones dept store in London were very helpful when we had to shop there recently. No fuss, no bother. I’m just about to write saying thank you. It’s worth telling staff if there’s a problem."
Maybe we should ask the other 120 countries where mask wearing is mandatory how they manage so well.

"Shop staff round me have been wearing face masks ever since they were allowed to re-open.I wonder if the price of masks will go up again? - there was something on TV this morning where some chap had worked out that the cost had gone up 1000%! Also, this will be manna from heaven for shoplifters - all CCTV systems rendered useless by Government diktat!"
>> I wonder if the price of masks will go up again? <<Almost certainly. The world is full of people ready to profit from a crisis. I'm opting for washable cotton masks - better for the environment and cheaper in the long run if I don't have to keep buying disposable ones.
"Our local Boots were selling masks for £30 for 50....did not buy it, not interested so not sure what kind they were.....might check later today"
I would encourage everyone to get a cotton washable re-usable one. Ultimately the disposal ones will probably end up doing more harm than good. Some people aren’t disposing of them properly. I’ve already seen countless numbers of them just lying on pavements.
B&M selling 25 for £8.99 disposable.5 reusable £8.99Anyone want gloves check the DIY stall. 120 Stanley for £3.99 but new stock will be £9.99. Looks the same as the more expensive
Is the virus going on holiday for the next ten days then?Tip for glasses wearers. Clean them with shaving foam to stop misting.Sympathy for the lip readers though. Pen and paper?
"I have masks given to me by my work and I have tried them.It takes me about 15min before they become unbearable and I have issues breathing due to my asthma. I will grin and bear it in the supermarket but forget about other shops, not worth the effort."
">>Our local Boots were selling masks for £30 for 50<<Wow....yes thats supply and demand for you. Our Tescos is selling 10 for £6.50.These suppliers are selling 1000 of them for £60 (once you put the VAT on) - though we pay a little less at work - so there is a definite middle man effecthttps:/…Edited: 7:39 am, July 14, 2020 "
Back in April M&S were selling 3 disposable masks for £3.I noticed last month that the price had gone down to 3 for £2.50. Think I'll have a look after I've finished work and see how much they are now. Place your bets!
"""If you cant wear a mask wear a face shield. I cant believe people are still making stupid selfish excuses.....""And it's this kind of attitude towards disabled people and people with physical and mental health conditions that means the High Street will be getting no trade from me while the masks rule is in place. Not everyone can wear a mask, and rude, ignorant and judgmental comments like this one make it extremely difficult for exempt people to go about their daily lives. We face verbal abuse on transport as it is, along with the Keyboard Warriors making statements like 'wearing a mask is an act of love, not wearing a mask is an act of hate' on social media. We will now face being stared and tutted at, and subjected to verbal abuse and harassment in the shops too. Lucky I enjoy online shopping.Edited: 8:22 am, July 14, 2020 "

"After only doing essential (food) shopping for months I am now going to have a blitz of retail therapy every day until 24/7.I see the social distancing seems to no longer apply so can't see the point of masks.It just seems ridiculous that you can go to the hairdresser, pub and swimming for example without wearing a mask but you are supposed to wear one while wandering around a shop.I have bought an ill fitting washable mask which I suppose I will have to keep in the car for the supermarket visits.Edited: 9:11 am, July 14, 2020 "
"""I see the social distancing seems to no longer apply so can't see the point of masks.""It is still supposed to apply and I can see the point of masks."
"Matt, in my local the supply of disposable face masks is rapidly dwindling but the price for 50 so far remains the same....for washable a pack of 3 is £15.I think we need to go to Prague soon, no face mask compulsory any more even not on public transport. the only exceptions are Ostrava/Karvina and that's because of the virus in the local mines."
"""If you cant wear a mask wear a face shield. I cant believe people are still making stupid selfish excuses.....I wish they made it compulsory to wear face coverings indoors since like, you know....march. I would defenetly feel more confortable if people took this seriously.""It was our wonderful, right on the ball Government who said wearing a mask was not necessary and offered no protection so don't blame people for following the Government's advice. Now for some reason they have changed their minds and blaming the scientists by say that the science has changed.To my mind the Government is trying to lay the blame for the infections to somebody else. So what better than those naughty members of the public nor wearing masks.""if people took this seriously"" yea right like the Government and its advisers are taking this seriously. Actually they are not the worst Government ever, that acolade goes to Chamberlain's Goverment. Then a toss up between David Cameron and the Brexit referendum and Boris Johnson and the virus. On the basis the DC wasn't responsible for the deaths of 45000 plus people BJ just wins it."
"""Sounds like a good thing to me if it helps to keep us all safer. ""Why wasn't it a good idea back in March?"
"""To my mind the Government is trying to lay the blame for the infections to somebody else.""This has been government policy from day one. The most recent example being the death in care homes attributed to the staff in care homes not following the correct procedures. Never forget : We are not all in this together."
"Oh dont get me wrong, the Goverment response to all of this has been a nightmare and they have blood on their hands. Its been ridiculous, nonsensical, with no scientific basis and totally infuriating.But I just cannot understand the people ignoring face masks on buses and trains, ignoring social distancing and complaining about glasses getting fogged as a reason not to wear a mask. Like surely some personal responsibility is also required here."
@Daymoth - I have read of proposals for a march to be staged against mandatory face coverings. That's some folks view of personal responsibility. Sadly.
"Great, second wave in 3, 2, 1....:("
"#33, It’s a personal choice for people to go to the pub or public swimming pool and most people who are at the greatest risk from contracting the virus and getting seriously ill will probably stay away from those places.The same cannot be said of Supermarkets where lots of vulnerable people still have to go to on a regular basis. By everyone wearing a mask in the supermarket it is reducing the risk of these vulnerable contracting the virus. It also makes those vulnerable people feel more comfortable going to the supermarket, some of whom won’t otherwise be leaving the house."
">>> Why wasn't it a good idea back in March? <<<Because there weren't even enough to protect essential workers, let alone the rest of us. Despite warnings that a pandemic was inevitable at some stage - and even when one became a reality - the government failed to plan or to act in a timely manner. Remember how the PPE advice to health workers at that time appeared to vary according to what was actually available?"
">>> I have read of proposals for a march to be staged against mandatory face coverings. That's some folks view of personal responsibility. <<<It would be ironic if, having marched, they were then stranded in Central London because the rail, tube and bus workers wouldn't let them on without masks!Of course, if mask wearing had been normalised before Dominic Cummimgs' lockdown trip to Durham there woi;d be less kickback against their use."
"I really dont get it. Do people really want others to die? Like independently of what stupidity the goverment says each week, I want to protect myself and others. I dont want a life long disability because of what an incompetent goverment said."
"""Do people really want others to die?""But, but......muh rites, there is no virus, the earth is flat and David Icke is right about 5GYou'll understand once you have had the microchip inserted along with the so-called vaccine."
">>Why wasn't it a good idea back in March?<<I think in March we were still thinking in terms of a mask protecting the wearer. And we didn't know as much about how the virus is transmitted as we do now. (This is in addition to the need to keep the N95 masks for medical workers, mentioned above.)Now we now that my mask protects you (in case I'm positive yet asymptomatic) and your mask protects me (for the same reason). I have chronic asthma and while wearing a mask isn't my favorite thing, I don't find it unbearable. (I took a train the other day from London to the Lake District so wore a paper mask under a cloth mask for 6 hours.)And if I smear washing-up liquid on my glasses and then wipe off, the fogging up is much less.I'd rather adjust to all of these inconveniences than get terribly sick (or worse). (And hear, hear, Daymoth!)"
"I’ve found a scarf offers more flexibility to cover my nose without misting my glasses than a mask. With a keffiyeh I can have 4-6 layers of thin cloth across my mouth, but just a couple over the tip of my nose - probably doesn’t protect me quite as well as a mask, but as I understand it the main thing for protecting others is covering the mouth. Plus, if I tie it under my chin, I’ve learned how to sort of burrow my way in and out of it without touching... With Reactolite glasses I do look a bit like a terrorist outside, though."
">> I really dont get it. Do people really want others to die? <<Perhaps a bit of perspective is in order here. Obviously people don't ""want others to die"" because they're not keen on wearing, or can't wear, a face mask. If you read the WHO guidance there is still a pretty significant degree of uncertainty about the benefits vs. challenges of wearing a mask, so it's very much not as straightforward as ""mask wearing = not getting Covid-19"". I'm sceptical for two reasons: the first is that transmission has been consistently falling for the last 3 months without mask-wearing in public places being mandated, and the second is that people who wear masks when they aren't used to it touch their faces constantly trying to position and readjust the mask, which to my mind rather defeats the object. There's also the risk that if masks aren't worn/disposed of correctly they can become vessels for spreading viruses.It seems to me as though this new position from the government is grounded not so much in public health, but in a desire to make people feel more confident to go out and do things that get the economy going again, like shopping. The government is torn between the desire to protect people by telling them not to mingle too much and the need for economic recovery; consequently it's fallen into a weird and inconsistent halfway house that nobody is really convinced or reassured by."
"Well infection and deaths have been going down because bars and non essential shops were closed,people have been avoiding public transport, many are working from home, and most people have been socially distancing since march.To reduce the need for social distancing and opening of indoors spaces you need additional measures or the infecction rates will go up again ( look at the USA).And while masks/face shields alone wont protect you and some people might use them wrongly,its clear that a widespread use reduces risks to everyone, wich could support the reopening of the economy ( look at east asia)."
So what will happen at our local petrol station which has a sign that you may be asked to remove masks along with motorcycle helmets?
Sounds as if you may be asked to remove your mask then.
>>Sounds as if you may be asked to remove your mask then.<<How can they do that which be in defiance of the law?
Common sense?It's what the government believes in.
"""It just seems ridiculous that you can go to the hairdresser, pub and swimming for example without wearing a mask but you are supposed to wear one while wandering around a shop.""I had to wear a mask when I went to the barbers last week. I also had to give them my name and phone number like you do at most of the responsible pubs. Back to disposable face masks at M&S that I mentioned in post #29. Well, they have moved the face masks and hand sanitiser from a display next to the baskets and trolleys (this was the Food Hall part) to a display next to the tills. But, surprise surprise, neither the face masks or hand sanitiser have price labels whereas orginally they did. Anyway, I advise everyone to just buy a face covering similar to one I bought online from Etsy back in April. It only cost £6 and is easy to wash. In fact, I think I'll buy a few more considering that we'll be wearing them for the foreseable future, and not only on public transport which is when I've been wearing mine.https://www.etsy.com/uk/market/face_mask"
"""I think we need to go to Prague soon, no face mask compulsory any more even not on public transport.""Fingers crossed my trip to Prague, Brno and Wroclaw can still take place in September. I can't wait to get away from this joke of a country! ;-)"
"+1 to Owl's post 49; truly some perspective is needed.When walking for exercise in the last four or five days the alternative mask wearing sightings have been more of chin and neck warmers than on the forehead, with the latter falling out of fashion. Masks pulled out of pockets or handbags and tugged on when entering a shop is still a popular pastime for many in my busy city. The idea that wearing a mask means physical distancing is no longer required remains hugely popular amongst those who are determined to miss the point.I have a cotton mask to be worn when travelling which I plan for a few weeks' time, but in the short term my choice will be to keep at least 2 metres from others and minimise time in the shops. As a side note, none of my friends working in clinical areas are wearing masks when away from work."
"What made me start wearing a mask?I was in a very small shop when a guy came in huffing and puffing. I left and on returning saw the spatter all over the perspex screenI was in a small shop when a woman wearing a mask gave a huge sneeze. Without the mask that would have covered the whole shelf of goods which would have had to be binned. In a supermarket you'd never have known that what you picked up was covered in spray.If you think that's not you tilt your phone, tablet or laptop to the light and look at the screen."
"'I was in a small shop when a woman wearing a mask gave a huge sneeze. Without the mask that would have covered the whole shelf of goods which would have had to be binned.'Did the mask-wearing woman make any effort to sneeze into her elbow? If not one wonders why the hell she didn't do so, quickly pulling down the mask before sneezing then mask up again."
"We were asked to wear a mask when we visited the hairdressers last Friday, no problem as been used to wearing a mask when out shopping for months now.I've noticed that mask wearing whilst shopping has dropped off considerably in my area over the past few weeks.Whatever the pros and cons, wearing a mask makes me feel a little bit safer when out.IMO the government were late to the party and haven't handled this at all well."
"I recommend using a snood as a face covering. They are comfortable and you can have them around your neck when you are not using them as face coverings. You can buy them from Amazon from companies such as Buff, which make nice ones."
And also bringing your glasses slightly forward overlapping the top of the mask stops the moisture hitting your glasses.
"#43 ""Because there weren't even enough to protect essential workers, let alone the rest of us. Despite warnings that a pandemic was inevitable at some stage ""And they knew from privious execises that they didn't have enough PPE. Anyway whilst we all guessed that was the real reason the reason the Government gave was that there was no scientific evidense for wearing masks."
"#38 ""The most recent example being the death in care homes attributed to the staff in care homes not following the correct procedures. ""Absolutely disgraceful what BJ."
"I want to know whose expected to enforce it, Boris said its not down to shop workers to enforce there is talk it will be enforced by the police but that would literally mean either police officers in every shop or driving around all day popping in and out of shops"
And still no publicity about how to wear a mask properly and how to dispose of it after use.The streets are going to be littered with masks and many will be contaminated and infected.The plastic ‘ disposable” gloves will also be discarded many ending upIn Rivers and the sea .
"If it helps the BBC news webpage has an article on face coverings, seehttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53395513"
"All about wearing masks and how to stop your glasses misting uphttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53395513If a mask is fitting well I've found making sure my specs are over the mask stops this. Cloth masks can have a tissue or coffee filter inserted which absorbs the moisture and that helps.Different types of mask fit better on different people. When you find a good design it's not difficult to wear one. Make it a funny one and it gets people smiling - and we want a bit more of that now :-)Edited: 8:06 am, July 15, 2020 "
"And apparantly it is perfectly safe not to wear a mask in an office https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53415030""Mr Hancock said coverings helped prevent spread during short interactions with strangers, but that social distancing and hand washing were more effective for contact with people over long periods of time.""That would be unless you coughed or sneezed in the office I guess."
Yes I have no idea what the logic about not wearing masks in the office is. If it mitigates the risk then why not?It all sounds like total pseudoscience at this point but would like to be proven wrong.
"If the government could point to real evidence from clinical trials about the effectiveness of mask wearing amongst the general population, rather than opinion, lab tests and data modeling, there would be less confusion and resistance. Instead, it's another contradictory seen-to-be-doing-something farce.Re earlier posts about glasses, the soapy water method doesn't work for me, shaving foam can damage coated lenses, and my glasses have too narrow depth to pull the mask up underneath them. I have better results with a homemade cotton mask with a stronger nose wire (pipe cleaner) which moulds closely around the nose and cheeks, although that makes it hot underneath. So the choice is steamy glasses but more comfortable to wear, or sweaty but I can see.Edited: 12:51 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"'I have no idea what the logic about not wearing masks in the office is. If it mitigates the risk then why not?' Because firm evidence for this is thin on the ground.The suggestion that aerosolised transfer of the virus may be a problem has been put forth, but lab-based studies for this are not the same as 'real life' experiences. Non medical masks should reduce droplet transmission, but if that mask becomes damp its efficacy will be reduced. Incorrect use of masks, not distancing and less frequent handwashing 'because I'm wearing a mask' may also reduce any potential benefits of having donned one in the first place.A mask is part of the infection control procedure but it's not the magic answer we've been waiting for. The environmental cost of discarded masks and gloves worn when not needed also needs to be addressed.'That would be unless you coughed or sneezed in the office I guess.' Coughing or sneezing should be done into a crooked elbow, but there's little of that seen. It does sound unpleasant but it's a damn sight better than loading up one's hand with all sorts of organisms."
I suspect people could if they wish wear face coverings in the office but currently it is not mandated.
">>A mask is part of the infection control procedure but it's not the magic answer we've been waiting for.<<Well exactly. Masks/shields, washing hands and phisical distancing are all risk reduction measures. So why not apply them all indoors unless not practicable is beyond me.How does the virus know if I see the same people at the office and not at the supermarket and therefore should behave differently?"
"""So why not apply them all indoors unless not practicable is beyond me.""There is nothing stopping you doing that should you wish."
>>There is nothing stopping you doing that should you wish.you know this has to be widespread to work properly right?
"In my office they have put plastic screens up around all the desks, the number of people allowed in the kitchen area has been reduced to 4 at a time (not sure how they came up with that figure), only 2 people are allowed in the lift at one time, and sinks and urinals (in the gents anyway) have been taped off to allow for social distancing (is socialising in office toilets common!?). But non of that stops someone from walking up to your desk and getting right in your face to ask a question or hand you a file, and it doesn't stop certain cliques from congregating around the photocopier to have a good old chinwag! And everyone in the office has been told that if they have any symptoms then they shouldn't come into work; which hasn't stopped several people who have hacking coughs from coming in anyway and insisting ""it's only my hayfever playing up!""."
"It strikes me that despite what the Government says and the easing of the lockdown, due to the fact that they are making in compulsary to wear a mask in shops then it must still be unsafe to venture out. So the simple answer is not to venture out and go shopping. I think that also need to be extended to attending the office. That must also be considered to be unsafe.That depression that is heading out way just go a whole lot larger."
"I thought the whole idea of wearing face coverings in shops was to make people feel safer about spending their money on the high Street as opposed to online, however I think whats more likely to happen is people decide on the spur of the moment things like 'oh I need milk at home and whereas before would pop into a shop to buy milk and end up with two carrier bags full of things they didn't realise they needed, now it'll be 'oh I need milk at home...i haven't got a face mask oh well and continue to walk byEdited: 3:56 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"""you know this has to be widespread to work properly right?""No. Does it"
"""I think that also need to be extended to attending the office. That must also be considered to be unsafe.""The company I work for takes up 2 floors of a 14 storey building. Half of the staff (in the company I work for) ended up working from home for the past 3 and a bit months, while several with medical conditions had no choice but to shield at home.The people shielding are obviously still at home. but those working from home are all now back in the office, by order of the management! Those of us who were left working in the office over the past 3 and a bit months were allowed to do staggered start and finish times, instead of the normal 9am-5pm, to allow for less bodies in the office all at one time. But now everyone is back in the office we have had to return to doing 9am-5pm, which means the full work force (except those who are still shielding) are now back working on the 2 floors of our office 9am-5pm.There must be another 12-15 companies spread out on the other 12 floors of the 14 storey building we are in, and most of those are still allowing their staff to work from home, because obvioulsy they don't think it's safe for all of their staff return to the office.And I've heard of lots of other businesses who have realised that allowing staff to work from home has worked so well through lockdown that they are going to continue allowing staff to work from home for the forseeable future. Because let's face it, who likes that horrible morning and evening rush hour commute, either by public transport or by car, with boring, relentless, ""Groundhog Day"", 9am-5pm Monday to Friday office hours. Well it seems that the company I work for thinks we all love it, and it seems they don't give a **** about this pandemic! In fact, at the start of lockdown, a certain Piers Morgan (who I'm not really a big fan of) was asking people to name and shame businesses that weren't sticking to lockdown rules, social distancing and more importantly, keepeing their staff safe.Well, someone in my office named and shamed our company. They thought they did it anonymously but were found out and...... got fired! Then two other people quit! This was back in March, and now the company I work for are acting as if lockdown and this whole pandemic don't exist and that things are back to normal!

">>What do you mean?

I cant understand why offices are being left out when they are classic infection petri dishes for the flu. <<Any responsible employer (and unfortunately this thread highlights that not all of them are) won't be operating its offices at full capacity anyway, and therefore having distance between employees and rigorous cleaning of desks and communal areas such as kitchens and toilets is going to be a vastly more effective way of preventing any virus spread than making staff sit there for 8 hours every day wearing masks. My office is currently running a skeleton staff only (I work for the NHS and only those directly involved in manning our Covid-19 response centre are working in the office at the moment) and when it does reopen to all staff it will operate at around 40% capacity to enable plenty of space between people and reduce bottlenecks in high traffic areas. If one of the rules for going back to the office is that I have to wear a mask for 8 hours every day, I shan't be going back in and will continue to work from home."
"That is very good #92. There is a farm in Herefordshire with 93 cases. Surely the point of compulsion, as we now see with shops, is to stop the spread by irresponsible individuals or companies.Otherwise what is the point. If, as the Government now ""seems"" be saying, in contravention of what they said earlier, that masks are required then surely they are required in all instances."

"Astolat, I've never been senior management (more senior iconoclast) and find corporate doublespeak nauseating. 'I grew more and more convinced that, more often than not, these unconsciously revealed precisely what the companies did NOT believe, but knew that they ought to' Quite agree.Outsourcing procurement of PPE is as baffling as was the outsourcing of catering and cleaning at my former workplace. That this is done with a claim to saving money often means no one has thought for a second about what would happen with any breakdown in the system or if extraordinary circumstances such as pandemic.If health care staff don't have enough disposable masks for their needs then the sight of people wearing them incorrectly and dropping them on pavements must be quite annoying."

"""... are staff encouraged to think for themselves or do what they're told?""Staff are basically encouraged to put up or shut up! I worked for many years in various public sector jobs and couldn't stand the red tape and bureaucracy, most of which was pointless. But at least in the public sector we had weekly team meetings, monthly 1 to 1's and you could approach your manager if you had any suggestions or problems. The place I'm at now has none of that, and neither did the bank I worked at for 6 months before quitting due to being treated like something you would flush down the toilet! Back to masks - on the train home today I saw a group of four lads, all in their late teens, waiting to get on my train. As we departed the conductor announced ""don't sit in the seats that are taped off and a reminder that face coverings are compulsory.""As I got off the train I noticed that the four lads were sat around a table which had 3 seats taped off, and only one of them had a face mask on.Come the 24th July do you really expect people like that, plus the thousands of others like them, to wear a face covering when they go inside a shop!?"

My cousin had a hospital visit today and an out-patient arrived and told the receptionist that she would not be wearing a mask as it was a waste of time. Receptionist told her that was fine. She would just cancel her appointment as none of the medical staff would be able to attend to her if she wasn't wearing a mask. She put a mask on.

"Because quite obviously reducing the supply of masks available to the NHS at the time they were most needed them would have been a great plan wouldn't it.............Don't forget its face coverings not specify masks and I'm sure if more input was put into the making of home made masks or even buying from the many UK companies that offered to make the masks rather than foreign companiesit would have been less of an issue, HOWEVER, the latest on the grapevine is people will be exempt from wearing a face covering in shops if it ""distresses them.....so basically the whole thing is just a bunch of meaningless words probably said in an attempt to distract us from other government issues"
"In addition to having had, for months, a state law that has mandated masks in indoor common areas, many shops here have also had their own strict ""no mask, no service"" rules. And people do get thrown out if they dare enter without one. But fortunately probably 99% of customers have masks. Same holds true for most office buildings and hotels in Manhattan. No mask, no enter."
How do you feel about a transparent visor as worn by hairdressers? This covers the face but does not stop you breathing easily or steam up glasses. Does that count as a mask?
"I don't know about in the UK, but in the US I believe those visors count as masks. However, I often see people wearing both masks AND visors. I also sometimes see people wearing two masks, or a mask and eye goggles (the virus sometimes enters through the eyes). People with the extra protection are often either vulnerable because of a medical condition or just very careful. Actually, anything that covers nose and mouth generally is accepted here, and there are many places on the internet (like on You tube) where you can find out how to make your own out of things like old tee shirts. I also see people tying things like bandannas and scarves around their faces. I recently had my hair cut for the first time in 4 months and my hairdresser told me she had a coffee filter under her mask (this is often recommended for extra protection). There is a woman in my building who I think places a fresh paper towel behind her mask every day."
"I visited The National Gallery yesterday. Their policy, now, is to encourage the wearing of facemasks but not to enforce it. Not sure if that will change when Covid19 returns from it's Summer recess on July 24th.Perhaps - July 23rd should be NATIONAL SHOP WITHOUT A MASK DAY!I cannot find any exemptions from mask wearing for the period of July 24th onwards ... say for people with severe breathing difficulties, I am one, and whether we will simply be denied access to all retail outlets, Museums, Galleries, Malls etc or will we face intense and intrusive interrogation at entrances. Anthony K"
"#109 Red, the exemptions are included here, and the requirement is “severe distress”. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/f…While I’m sure some people will try it on, there are many others who arguably would not qualify as “unable” to wear a mask under the disability exemption, but whose autism, OCD, phobias etc make it so difficult that they would just refuse to go out. Since maintaining socialisation is normally vital for these groups’ mental health, there does need to be some leeway."
Face masks are not THAT effective But it’s all about small margins isn’t it?If nobody where’s a mask then there is a greater chance of increasing the rate of infectionIf nearly all the population wears a mask when shopping or on public transport Then there is an increased chance of reducing the rate of infectionLet’s not face mask shame those who can’t wear one for good reasonIt’s not going to make THAT much difference if it’s only 1 or 3 % when you multiply it through
"In Scotland where the requirement was introduced earlier the numbers following to the rule seems to high. There are those, without exemptions, who will attempt to avoid wearing any face covering but they are a minority."
"""so basically the whole thing is just a bunch of meaningless words probably said in an attempt to distract us from other government issues""Precisely.

">> Sometimes you just have to put personal wants to one side. <<I think Anthony has already made clear that the impact of lockdown on his mental health has been significant - this is part of the problem of dealing with the pandemic and moving into our new reality, whatever that looks like. People's health is suffering severely as a result not of coronavirus, but of the reaction to it, the constraints on their lives and to some extent the fear of going out that the early lockdown messaging from the government promoted in order to get people to stick to the rules. It's very possible that, when this all shakes out (and we won't know for quite some time yet), more people will have died as a result of the measures taken to combat the spread of Covid-19 than died of the disease itself.That doesn't relate directly to the wearing of masks in shops, but is an important point that tends to be missed in the hysteria about Covid.I have to say I haven't noticed any significant increase in the number of people wearing masks in the supermarket since the government announced the change of policy on it. I'm venturing to Westfield in Stratford tomorrow for the first time since lockdown started, so it'll be interesting to see if the situation there is much different - I'm guessing it may well not be, and it will take the new rule becoming official for people to comply on the basis that it's not worth it not to.

They sell Face Sheilds on Amazon.........surprisingly cheap. Easy to clean so you only need the one.The staff in some shops here are wearing them all day quite comfortably so for a shopping trip or coffee out they should be ok. I like the idea of these. They'll certainly protect from the spray people give when they cough and you won't get it unknowingly on your face then touch itMight go for them later on when we get our town back from the non socially distanced visitors. Only problem I can see is if you want to carry them to the shops any distance.A cloth shoe bag could do the job.
"""They sell Face Sheilds on Amazon..""Costco has been selling them."
"Toopaz, would the shields protect from a more indirect exposure than a direct cough? There seems an awful lot of room for the virus particles to get under the shield. Is there any literature on the effectiveness of the shield versus a mask?"
"So you're demanding that people be forced to put their own health at risk?I'm not DEMANDING anything, I'm merely pointing out that Boris Johnsons plans that everyone wear a face covering in shops is simply not enforcable"
"Based on what I have read, there is growing evidence that (1) the greater and longer your exposure to virus droplets, the greater your chances of (a) getting sick and (b) possibly getting very very sick (e.g. an ER doc who has 3 COVID positive patients throw up in his face in the course of an afternoon has a greater chance of getting sick than I do if I happen to pass one of those patients while walking down the street) and (2) mounting research is showing that talking in an animated way over the course of at least 15 mins while in close contact with another person can spread the virus, possibly more than a sneeze, something a mask may help minimize. In searching for ""patient zero"" in US (never found) researchers identified at least 3 case clusters where many cases developed this way: a drug company corporate conference at a hotel in Boston, a 50th birthday party at a private home in a wealthy community in Fairfield County CT and a convention at a Hilton in midtown Manhattan. These all took place last winter in maybe Jan or Feb, before anyone was even thinking about masks, and resulted in the spread of multiple cases throughout the US. All three events also involved serving of alcohol, which sometimes ""loosens up"" people and encourages longer, more animated talking, and the longer an infected person talks in this way the more likely they are to infect others. So I get the impression it's not so much sneezes and coughs they're worried about now as talking in close proximity -- whether in a bar or restaurant, a workplace, on public transit, or at home.Edited: 12:47 am, July 18, 2020 "
"I think a related type of situation they are now concerned about is where someone is just breathing near you for a period of time -- for example, if you are sitting on a crowded train or bus and someone is standing in front of you or next to you, maybe with head down and reading, and that just continues for 20 or 30 minutes. If they have a mask on it should minimize the amount of their breath that hits you(and if you have a mask on too, that may further minimize effect of their fumes)."
"That makes sense QQ2 - viral load .There’s a notion that the amount of virus you “ take in” influences the severity of the effects of the disease.So be in close contact in say a nightclub or a sports stadium people singing out loud and shouting could cause more infection than say a few people sitting having a picnic in a park . FACE SHIELDS are being misused Face shields are predominately PPE used in industry and hospitals to protect the wearer from splashes of corrosive substances when handling chemicals or in hospital from highly infectious bodily fluids entering eyes, nose or mouth.In the U.K. they seem to be the standard for hairdressers which imho is totally useless and maybe harmful.The hairdresser wears a face shield which is open to fresh air.The hairdresser’s face is above the clients head.Whenever the hairdresser breathes out the droplets , invisible and microscopic, are collected on the inside face of the mask and can be directed outwards and downwards towards the client.The face visors are designed to protect the wearer from exterior contamination They are useless at stopping any infected droplets being spread from inside the face shield"
"Yes, Leuca, and I believe there have also been a number of clusters here involving choirs."

Anything obvious and you have to make an appointment to see a Doctor.Also will tell you not to smoke, drink less , eat more healthy and lose weight even though the nurse themselves might be overweight"
"""Annual reviews?"" - I have three monthly bloods taken, by a nurse, which determines everything my Doctor needs to know.Keep well allAnthony K"
"#174. On average an individual GP will have about a thousand patients who qualify for a free flu jab. For a practice with half a dozen GPs that's a considerable number of patients. My own practice advertises two afternoons, come any time. You arrive to what appears to be total chaos, but in fact there are four or five rooms where jabs are being given with a very slick team of three. One asks the questions, one updates the computer, one gives the jab. In and out in no time. I've never been there more than ten minutes.The fact that you just went home suggests that it's your own fault you didn't get a jab. It's possible your practice is less efficient than mine. But to blame the government??"
"#192 ""The fact that you just went home suggests that it's your own fault you didn't get a jab. ""I didn't blame anybody for not getting a jab. I didn't get flu that year anyway. You are correct in everything that you say but about the numbers of patients etc but what has that got to do with making an appointment then making it a free for all. You might just as well do all consultations on that basis if that was the case."
"#190 """"annual review"" is "" the medical "" offered by your GP surgery once you hit a certain age, possibly 60.""Can't be 60 or even 65. I have never been offered one. Never even heard about this tio ask to have one. Sounds a good idea though."
"I'm having my blood tests (HbA1c and thyroid) and blood pressure check this week, having had them delayed (they were supposed to be done in March). I might ask if I can get my flu jab there and then. Might as well if the nurse and I are already masked up.I think you only get ""annual reviews"" (or regular reviews) if you have an underlying health condition.Edited: 4:06 am, July 20, 2020 "
Just found this. Interesting that after 74 they don't bother. I assume that this is something new as it says 40 to 74 and you have one every 5 years not annual though.
"#193 Earlier you said that on trying to get a flu jab""Not content with wait of 3 or 4 hours I went home. I hope they are better organised when it comes to doing covid 19 vaccinations. On the basis of the Government's performance up to now I am not holding my breath.""I took that to mean that you thought that providing you with a timely flu jab was the Government's responsibility."
"If a viable Covid-19 vaccine does become available, I will queue as long as it takes. I will pack sandwiches and a thermos if I have to, although I hope it won't come to that."
"If you sign up and report regularly on the Imperial Zoe COVID app, you can join their register of people willing to take part in vaccine trials. Obviously, even if chosen, that means a small risk of side effects they hadn’t previously spotted, and only a 50/50 chance of getting the real vaccine, but still...https://covid.joinzoe.com/"
"'Interesting that after 74 they don't bother. I assume that this is something new as it says 40 to 74 and you have one every 5 years not annual though.' If this is in reference to an annual review or well person review, then after 74 or 75 goalposts do shift a bit.If someone has chronic conditions that need regular review they should continue to have follow up, but there is a fair bit of discussion about whether large scale screening is required in previously healthy people. Older persons may want the choice of how their care should proceed from their mid 70s or 80s as well, and I do think that those able to make an informed decision about what they'd like and what can be stopped should have their voices heard.'If a viable Covid-19 vaccine does become available, I will queue as long as it takes.' Not if but when. I too would queue for the vaccine."
"In terms of when and not if, due to my ""found"" conditions, when aged 61, and continuing poor health, my Doctor now takes a set of bloods every three months.The queue will be for the Flu vaccine, this Autumn, long before the queue for the Anti-Coronavirus vaccine begins to form.Keep well allAnthony K"
