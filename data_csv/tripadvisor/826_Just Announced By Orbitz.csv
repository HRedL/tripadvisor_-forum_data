"Stay away from Orbitz. I had to cancel a flight in April that I had book on Orbitz due to COVID-19. I called and rebooked the flight for mid-June, and received an itinerary confirming the new flights. When I tried to check-in for the new flight, the airline said that Orbitz had not properly ticketed the flight, so we had no reservation. After HOURS on the phone with Orbits Customer Service, I was told there was nothing the could do and they would simply re-issue my credit. That left us stuck with no flight the night before our vacation. This trip was to celebrate by son's graduation from High School . They had cancelled prom, sports and the graduation ceremony. I was not going to have his miss this trip to. At considerable expense, I bought last minute flights directly on Delta.Now all I want is my money back from Orbitz. I have no travel planned and don't need credit. I bought a service from them and they did not deliver. Do yourself a favor. Book directly with the airline - always!!"
"Mike M:>>the airline said that Orbitz had not properly ticketed the flight<<I don't disagree with the comment about booking direct vs booking through a third party. However, the airline can make the same type of ticketing mistake. I have previously missed flights because of an airline's ticketing mistake. I had booked direct through the airline's website. I had checked my reservation online the night before and the day of my trip and all appeared OK. However, once I reached the airport, I was not allowed to check in for the flight - there was a ticketing issue with the airline's website."
