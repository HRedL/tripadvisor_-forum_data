"A positive precautionary step maybe, but it seems a step back if anything. Certainly appears that any FCO advice allowing us back into Egypt is a long way off."
"Well it can't get any worse currently. Luxor has started reporting more cases and a climb of 8 so they say in Red Sea excluding Sinai.Honestly if people are still thinking they are returning to Egyot this year and as much as I need that to happen.I have read what the Uk Government said about Egypt and they have had discussion but here does no favours still by reporting inaccurate figures and no official system and that was the UK response...I will try to find it and if current logic is anything to go by with Spai and France off the list and Malta and some Careibean destinations then sadly anyone holding their breath should hold it until at least 2021.Tui confirmed all advance bookings for myself now cancelled up to and including 30th November.Easyjet flights returning in September? I find that very vary unlikely and if they did would be Sharm if i guessed..No I do not know but Port Ghalib is a ghost town, reefs are absolutely outstanding, dugongs have returned dolphins close to shore along with some sharks recently that even they seem relaxed.I have never seen the reefs and corals growing back so quickly.Even Coraya Bay that is usually like Blackpool is currently like a giant heated Aquarium."
