"Hello,I've read that there is at least 1 case of confirmed coronavirus in Zante. Is it true?"
Might be of interest . . https:/…hopefully dies down in Early May as experts predict.I will still visit in May if not restricted.
I’m feeling apprehensive about our up and coming 1st Greek Easter visit. Greek Easter Sunday falls in exactly 6 weeks time to the day on the 19th of April !!!
"I'd read from that that some people from Zakynthos have tested positive on returning to the Greek mainland and have probably been put into isolation there. It doesn't say that they've got back to the island before being diagnosed.Certainly it's a worry but I don't think there are many places on the planet you can go to escape it at the moment so unless we're told we can't go we'll be going.Edited: 8:48 am, March 08, 2020 "
DomPractically every country in Europe has at least one case now. How do you know you’re any less likely to catch it at home?
"I have four trips in & around Europe this starting next Sat 14th, IF the planes are flying I will be on them"
"As regard’s to my post above I’m apprehensive about our trip actually going ahead due to possible flight cancellations and not the threat of the corona virus itself. Sorry about any confusion incurred, I should have worded it more clearly."
"Appreciate your qualification Mondeo. My comments still stand and were meant as much for the OP, who must be concerned to have posted in the first place,I hope everyone can still get away on their holidays as planned."
I have been looking for reviews of Zante hospital but can't find anything recent is it still open and how good is it.
"It's a fairly new hospital Ann and from all I've heard the medical attention is pretty good. On the other side the personal care as in eating/drinking is not so great and left down to the family/friends of patients.Having said that a (local) friend of ours over there whose wife was pregnant last year went to the mainland for all appointments/delivery because he wasn't happy with the local facilities, apparently that's not uncommon.I think if you go with the attitude that you're worried about the medical care you're not going to have a great time so should maybe stay home. That's not directed at you personally Ann I just think if anyone is going to spend their days scared it kind of defeats the object of having a holiday.Edited: 2:03 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"we are due to visit Zante on 22nd May, fully intend to enjoy our weeks holiday. Hopefully it won't be cancelled by tour opertor or governments. I need to see some sun :)"
"Thank you guys.I asked because I wanted to go there in July, so now I am thinking about if I should cancel my trip. Anyway, I can cancel it until the middle of June, so I'll see it later. :)Hope the situation won't get much worser than how it is now."
"@VegasShowgirlWell, I'd go there by car. Visiting Zakynthos would be part of an individual car trip (not a tour with an agent!). So definately it has bigger danger, than staying at home and not really going out from the house. ;)"
I spoke to someone on the island and as of 10th March there is 4 known cases on the island.
"I've not heard anything about a case in Zakynthos, but found this:https:/…coronavirus-greeceI'm not due to go to zante until later this year, but that said, unless I'm told Greece is a no go zone, I'm definitely going."
"Loving the optimism on here, but I think we all have to be realistic. This pandemic could be affecting 50 to 60 % of the population of Europe by early summer, no one will be going anywhere unfortunately. Jet 2 cancelled all flights to Spain this morning and that is just the start. We are supposed to be in Alykes in June and Italy in September, but it’s now looking like a tent in the back garden."
"According to the Greek media there are now 190 confirmed cases and 3 deaths, one of them in Zante hospital. If it goes the same way as Italy then it will peak in May/June. Easyjet are allowing flight changes with no admin charge so I've swaped to a flight in late September."
Ive not heard anything but I'm flying there 1st week in May and I'm going unless they lock zante down
"Regarding the 'new' hospital on Zakynthos four years ago while on along holiday my wife developed double pneumonia and was treated there. Yes the food was a problem , the solution is to get your partner to bring in some thing. But the treatment was and is absolutely 1st class. Just do not forget your E.H.I.C. card, it is still valid in the E.U. and get a receipt for every thing and make a claim when you finally get home, It will be easy to extend your holiday till all is well ."

"Hi thereI have relatives there, yes 1 death and i think 4 or so cases, everything is closed, schools, shops, cafes etc. No accommodation open till 1 st April (i think). They are all in quarantine. No moving about allowed, even people walking on the beach were chased off by cops. Terrible for the tourist season... hopefully things improve by then :(... i would seriously not travel there in the next 3 months at least. they are so close to Italy...."
Correction: No seasonal accommodation open till 1st May. But probably not even then. But Zante's season probably does not normally start until May. Apart from this year.
its not about you catching it .its about any one in your hotel apartment.your be in your room for 14 days and pay for another flight home.
"It's not going to go away any time soon, so, I'd forget coming here until next year, if I were you!"

post 27we are booked for week before. looks like a change to later in year or even next year. Hope *local* businesses survive. Bad times for all.
"#27 Even if you make it with the flight, be prepared for self quarantine as soon as you reach Greece."
booked for 1st 2 weeks in July.fingers crossed things have clamed down by then.
"Dreamday when did you book? Not in recent days I hope. That's a bit risky isn't it? You'll not have any protection from any holiday insurance as a lost resort that's for sure.Or did you mean you'd booked a while ago and hope it all gets better quickly. Based on how this virus is impacting Italy, Iran, Spain etc. (and soon UK), July doesn't seem far enough away."
@DreamdayWe also booked for that time... I really hope everything will get better by then.
I honestly don’t think any one will be holidaying in Europe before at least September.
What a dilemma my husband and I are booked with Jet2 and are travelling to Zante at the end of this August we are hoping that it will die down by then but on the other hand it could be a lot worse? I was paying off our holiday in instalments but now I think I will leave payments to the last deadline in case of cancellation .Like other people have said if the airlines and government don't ban us then we will still be going
booked in DecemberGoing in JulyAll being well
I booked the hotel separately so only deposit paid balance on arrivalFlight with JET 2 So I would just delay things if JET 2 are not going by July.
zante is in lock down .250 euro fine if seen out side .
"We are booked to be in Alykes on 30th May with Jet 2. Now I know this is very unlikely to happen, yet Jet 2 have just taken the final payment of nearly £1K from my bank account. I am not working (self-employed) and my wife was finished from her job today. When should I book car parking ?"
Don't book parking - you won't be going to Zkynthos at the end of May unfortunately.
"Yeah I know that rjt. It was a somewhat tongue in cheek question to be honest. I suppose my main point was that Jet2 has taken my payment, in full, for a service that they are not going to provide. I’m sure we’ll get a refund, but the money would have been better in my account than theirs."
"Don't think you will be going, I believe Zakynthos gas been closed down, at least for April.I holiday there twice a year and my friend who owns the apartments said she has been told to cancel all Easter bookings.Sorry, but don't be put off from going later when all this is over as it is a beautiful island with extremely friendly people and great food."
One other point: if you can go you will have to self isolate for 14 days.
They are on lockdown.
"From the social media reports I’ve read of late Zakynthos is corona virus free now. There were 5 reported cases a while ago, these were within a group that had just returned from a trip to the Middle East. Sadly one elderly man in this group passed away but the other 4 made a full recovery. I see that the daily commuter flight to and back from Athens is still flying but overall at the moment the rest of Greece has a generally low number of cases."
"#48. Yes, Greece has done brilliantly in containing the C.V. The Greek government took some very tough decisions early on but the country is seeing the benefits now. They’ll not forfeit that in a hurry."
"With the start of the holiday season being delayed indefinitely, but hopefully starting sometime in the next few months, I wonder if the owners have given any thought to staying open later this year to try to recoup some of the lost money. Usually the season is over by the end of October but I'm sure if there were flights there then people would continue to go there into November. Usually the weather is still in the low 70s or high 60s then. I'm pretty sure I would go then but would anyone else?"
"#50. This question’s cropped up recently elsewhere. The consensus from those ‘in the know’ seems to be that November, whilst good last year, can be very unpredictable, rain being the main issue. Also, depending on where you are staying, the dark evenings can create problems too. We once had a late October holiday in north Corfu, stayed right opposite the beach. There was no lighting at all along the little road, it felt quite intimidating at times, let alone coping with the challenges thrown up by the uneven surface. Luckily, although we were staying on a b+b basis, the hotel also provided evening meals if you wanted them. Saved the day for us. I personally would never travel that late again."
Hi! Is your trip still on? We have a week booked in may and not sure if the lockdown will allow us to fly.
Rog. unlikely you’ll know for sure until travel restrictions beyond the end of April are known. It’s a wait and see situation but I personally hold out little hope of any travel until much later in the summer.
It is not only IF Zakynthos is clear & taking Holiday makers again its IF the airlines are flying from UK. Fingers crossed for everyone.
"This has been said by many recently and it will be said again: I cannot believe how selfish and stupid people are. The decision to travel to a country with much fewer cases, is Not just 'up to the individual or what you think is best'. Such thinking is PRECISELY why outbreaks happen in the first place. It is not just about whether the destination is a risk to You, but whether You are a risk to the natives of the destination. Britain has vastly more cases than Greece, so your decision to travel to Zakynthos must be based firstly on the risk You pose to Them. IF youve been isolated for the requisite time and continue to be, have taken all precautions and continue to, carefully monitor any development of symptoms - and have none, have made any reasonable medical contact, will continue to act as a responsible adult, and, if possible, have been tested and cleared, THEN you may consider what lesser risks the Zakynthians pose to you.Can't rationalise? Yes you bloody Can."
The Greek government acted fast in suppressing the spread of the corona virus that is why we have a very low infection rate. The prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis held a meeting with heads of the Greek tourism board and tourism companies. Here is a link explaining a little bit about what they discussed -https://news.gtp.gr/2020/04/09/greek-pm-sets-target-save-2020-tourism-amid-covid-19-crisis/?fbclid=IwAR0c06OZ6VqAga2JETjQeJr5wm2cD2FBVOwvBpR1RQQJ79pgUcOBOnz0q3cAlso if you wish to have updates about the situation in Greece I recommend following Dave's Travel Pages on Facebook he is an expat from the UK now living in Greece and he updates his page with the latest news on the corona virus.
"Or, if not on Facebook, you can look at the ‘sticky’ at the top of the main Greece forum page, which also gets regularly updated with the very latest information from the Greek government.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…Edited: 3:26 am, April 10, 2020 "
An update on what the Greek government are trying wanting to do to save the summer seasonhttps:/…
"#58. Interesting article, thanks for posting."
I think this is the most recent update regarding travel to Greece. It is a detailed article about who and what can come and go. It also states the number of cases that we currently have (as of yesterday) https:/…
Some positivity from our island. There was a piece on Dutch TV about Zakynthos. Below is the link and story about it. https:/…
"Very good post Wis EyeWe really need to consider what travel is sensible not just is the flight going?We are in lockdown in the UK and from this to in a matter of weeks maybe 14 visits to restaurants frequent bar visits being by a pool with other guests.Where have all the people you will be in contact with have come from?What have they brought with them?What about all the people who might have been there the weeks before you arrive, what did the leave in the bars etc and with waiters etc.Certainly their will always be a risk of taking infection with you and for quite some time a greater chance of picking it up while you are their.None of that has anything to do with the current situation in Greece/Zante right now.Millions of tourists change that dynamic."
"I suspect the Greek government will take all the above eventualities into account when deciding when it's safe to ""open up for business"" so it won't be down to individual choice by us tourists.On the numbers they seem to be handling things a hell of a lot better than the UK, Italy, Spain etc so I'll put my trust in them. If my flight flies I'll be on it, if it doesn't I'll understand."
"The island would love to be open for tourism as that makes up most of working population BUT with a population of around 40,000 opening the border way to soon could lead to devastating consequences.The reported cases in the UK is 16.506, that's almost half the population of the island add to that a hospital that can just about cope with tourists accidents it would be a disaster to open tourism any time soon even though people are struggling with money. It could even lose all of 2020 season.Wouldn't take much to start a major outbreak on the island that's without thousands of tourists arriving. In a season the island can reach nearly 200,000 tourist in total.Big decision wealth or health?I think its better to lose a season than to maybe close down the island for a few years if there was a major outbreak.Edited: 5:49 am, April 21, 2020 "
"Sorry i meant 16,506 deaths not cases, the cases are 124,743 so that's more than 3 times the population in cases alone."
"On another post i posted that total number of registered cases from countries who visit Zakynthos comes to 1,373,000, that's registered only.. Can you imagine if just 50 from that total came to the island staying in hotels over the island that hold 300+ tourists staying AI. It would spread so quickly.Terrible thought."
That is right twinkletoes the government have done an outstanding job so far in protecting its citizens so I believe they will make the right calls going forward. As Kevin said it would spread so quickly if things were rushed back to normal and all the good work would be undone. Safety first. Greece and Zakynthos will be ready when the world is.
"A follow up, here is a very detailed and up to date article about the cases and situation in Zakynthos and the Ionian islands https:/…"
"In all for Zakynthos 6 cases which is great they have been contained.To start tourism any time soon would ruin all the great work the local zakynthians have done. Lets keep Zakynthos clear of danger until the rest of the world is sorted.Edited: 1:16 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"I’m sure the Greek government will see to that Kevin. Staycation, should that be permitted here...eventually, is the way to go until everywhere is looking much, much healthier. Believe me, we’ve got our hands full trying to sort out our own domestic challenges right now without even thinking about inadvertently carrying the virus to an otherwise ‘clear’ environment like Zakynthos.Edited: 1:35 pm, April 21, 2020 "
The most recent update from today. Apparently after the recent tests we have no known cases of the virus on the island. https:/…
Katerina. We all hope the Island stays clear & the IF we are given the all clear to travel & the airlines start flying again we can all come over to visit again. Keep Well & Healthy everyone
I've got flights for August booked in November. I'm not super confident but pretty hopeful I'll be on that flight
"Thank you Joe, we can not wait to open our island again and welcome you all. Greece is ready when the world is until then stay safe. and lets hope so Mike you can make that flight."
"Booked zante with jet2 last October and paid in full,got email from jet2 to say my flights have changed to earlier times so I suppose I'm still going on 24th June just wondering how they're going to safe distancing on the plane and transfer coach."
They won't cancel any flights until the last hour if a cancellation is needed so just keep checking for updates. Read somewhere that travel seems very doubtful until at least mid July. I will try to find the article and post thread.
"Don’t want to usurp Kev here, but Isobel, you really need to be keeping an eye on this thread, which gets updated rapidly when new factual information is released by the Greek government.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…No matter what schedules are changed, flights just won’t happen unless the Greek government allow them to land. Jet2 will contact you much nearer your departure date regarding your holiday. Do be prepared for it not to go ahead though ☹️."
"Isobel WoW can’t believe that with almost 30,000 people losing their lives in UK your wondering how you’ll socially isolate on a plane to Zakynthos next month? And how they’ll manage the coach??? Keep Zante safe. Think you’ll be staying in the house in Uddingston!Edited: 5:28 pm, May 03, 2020 "
The reality is you can't social distance on a plane or coach. When your in a confined space with no movement and no natural ventilation anyone coughing is going to cause anxiety for some. Then the airplane hosts won't be able to give the usual service as they won't be social distancing.If you look at the facts can you really see us all jetting off anytime soon? I for one can't and it would be totally irresponsible of the companies if they did.Even Heathrow has said it would be totally impossible to social distance at airports with thousands roaming around. I guess as airports would be classed as places of mass gatherings these would be the last places on the list to reopen fully.
"Have to agree with oceanic-Kevin, it would be complete madness to allow people to start jetting off all over world for there holidays.No doubt there would be a second wave of the virus and I suspect it would be worse than the first.I have a holiday booked for the middle of July, I know it will be cancelled, but I wouldn’t go anyway."
"On the subject of social distancing, Gatwick has on average 126,000 passengers a day through its terminals.How would that amount of people be policed for social distancing?"
https:/…So its ok to be in touching distance? Ridiculous.
Hello.Were you able to go to Zakynthos finally? How is the situation there?Thank you and have a nice day !
"No flights going to the island.Edited: 4:23 am, May 06, 2020 "
Wizz air have announced that they will begin new routes from London Luton to Zakynthos starting the 1st of July 2020. Of course it does not mean that they are going ahead 100% because there are so many factors involved.Here is a link https:/…
"Hi Katerina, hope all is well on the island for you and your hotels will be seeing guests very soon."
"Hello Kevin, thanks a lot. We are preparing and ready to adapt to whatever situation finally comes our way. Wishing you all the best."
"Hello Katerina, hope you are all well and staying safe. Cant wait to come and stay once again at the Palace but fear that we will not be allowed this season.However.I live in hope."
"Agreed Kev, I’m in touch via e mail with some friends I met who live there, or who have homes on the island. As of yesterday they were informed not to expect incoming flights of holidaymakers this season. These are people on the east coast who moved out there and work in hotels as managers etc......I now have to make a decision, cancel September and lose deposit for us all, or pay in full next month for four of us for the two weeks.........I’m still trying to get my May trip sorted with TUI and it’s useless.......I’ve never seen so many negative comments on one company on this site......I don’t feel safe on a flight in September with this still around. Even more so with Charlie.......plus, it’s a lot of money for TUI to be holding until it’s all cleared up.....and being honest......I think they will cease trading before next year....sad times.......pity last year was the last for you but at least I got to see you in October....."
"SO, now with the new UK ""quarantine"" rules of people entering the UK from other countries will this mean that after a lovely weeks holiday in Greece, Spain, Italy etc you then have to self isolate for 14 days.I'm sure peoples companies who are working will love that, 3 weeks off for 7 days holiday.Just gets more absurd with every travel related article. Please let there be some sensible level headed news for the travel industry. God knows the people depending on tourism need it.Edited: 6:44 am, May 12, 2020 "
That’s exactly what it means Kev...sadly. Goodbye holidays. ☹️
Article released an hour ago.https:/…
"This will send a real shockwave across the news of tour operators, and a real dilemma for those who like me have paid a deposit, and being now asked to pay the rest. I either pay up and save the deposit, or refuse and hope I can recover the deposit using his comments as a starting point.With so much confusion created by poor management decisions I fear lots of people will lose out big time. Yes the sun is great, as is a holiday. But I now have to choose whether to lose £1000 deposit, or let TUI act as my ‘holiday bank’ for a further £4500....."
"The other side of the virus rules is the social distancing effect on pre-opening. Before any tourist can even step foot in a accommodation all the work has to done like before every season. Licences, Electricians, plumbers, fire inspections, health and safety inspections then you have food and beverage deliveries. With lockdown none of this could go ahead. Even if lockdown gets lifted there may be a few weeks before anything is ready. I think end of July beginning of August so perhaps could get half a season out of 2020 or even extend into November if possible. I've been on the island a few times in November and the weathers been really good but changeable. Could be an option."
"Just announced Greece will be releasing a list of countries who's tourists can visit the country and it's expected UK won't be on that list.I did say this may happen.Edited: 1:52 pm, May 20, 2020 "
Just seen this posted on Twitter an hour agohttps://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…
"This I think makes everything a bit more clear about when Greece will reopen and how it will work.https://www.ekathimerini.com/253248/article/…Edited: 9:18 pm, May 31, 2020 "
So as it stands holidays are a no go. As you will be tested and if negative you self isolate 7 days. If positive self isolate 14 days. I'm guessing the flights from UK to Athens are more for permanent residents or business.https:/…
"Thanks for sharing that Kevin.Edited: 4:52 am, June 01, 2020 "
Just watched our local news program where they said trying to get insurance cover for Covid 19 is going to be very difficult if not impossible. Looks like you're going to have to gamble on not contracting the virus if you want your holidays.
"Staysure are offering insurance that covers Covid-19, just taken out a policy for my partner. Also offering 15% off. Luckily I was offered a good deal on my annual policy so renewed early before this all kicked off so am also covered."

"Tedfred so sorry to hear that, Those of us who have bookings in the future are keeping everthing crossed that we will be able to get there, Myself Sept 19th. We all want to get back but it must be safe fore us to travel & safe for our friends in Zakynthos to welcome us back. Like you IF cancelled this year will be looking forward to getting back next year & maybe twice to make up for the missed trip. Might go twice anyway I love it there :-)"
My partner was in zante hospital 3 years ago as he was a type 1 diabetic but in kidney failure and they were amazing. Nursing staff weren’t friendly and it didn’t feel like a hospital when he got taken in I just was wandering round trying to find him as no one to help but care was amazing and result and tests back ASAP much quicker and much more in-depth than a trip to a&e here

"Hi All, we go away next week to Zante after travelling there for many years. I'm just wondering if the locals are looking forward to receiving tourists again or if there is some apprehension? I hope that restaurants etc are open as usual (well as normal as they can in this situation), as we are self catering. Any information would be great."
I know in the resort of Alykanas there are quite a few bars and restaurants open so I would think this would be the case all over the island.
What is the level of coronavirus in Zakinthos
#113. Ask google.
I'm sure someone on this forum will have some information Phil.

Did you go to Zante and how ‘normal’ was it? We go in 4 weeks.

"According to https://coronavirus.pineza.eu/ there are 5 confirmed casesI am in Zante right now on my honeymoon, here's what I've witnessed:I) incoming travellers at Zante airport appear to be selected randomly to be tested (it seems to just be a temp check, but they seemed to be set up with medical staff with additional apparatus, I can't say for certain that it's an actual test)II) masks are mandatory in shops, hotel receptions etc, but it's not being overly enforced for tourists in the areas we've visited which are Drosia, Navagio Beach, Tsivili, Gerakas - the locals appear to be wearing masks always though, from hotel staff to bar/resteraunt staff, cab drivers, and even locals on mopeds and in carsIII) sanitiser stations are abundantIV) buffet styles seem to be restricted to one member of staff who serves up requested dishes for hotel guests, or food is presented by waiters on request if a la carteV) atmosphere is still relaxed - we've enjoyed our stay despite the safety measures in place - it's not particularly tenseVI) bars and restaurants must now close between midnight and 7am, and other guests have told me that owners/operators of said venues have told guests they can't dance (or must be sat at their allocated table) for fear of being shut down and/or fined by the Hellenic policeVII) you must complete the online passenger locator form before arriving - i understand this is not just Zante, but across Greece as a wholeVIII) I'm unsure of the exact details, but service staff (not exclusively) are offered up to €600 not to go to work, so everywhere appears understaffed and the staff present are working longer hours - they're working very hard but they're tired and at least two hotel staff have told me they regret agreeing to work because it's the most stressful season they've ever workedI hope this helps, please feel free to add or correct as appropriate based on experience or updatesEdited: 6:37 pm, August 12, 2020 "
