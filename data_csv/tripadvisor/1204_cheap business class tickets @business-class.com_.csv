"Does anyone have experience with Business-class.com? They offer good deals on business class tickets but it seems for me to good to be true or suspicious. Also, I only find good reviews at trustpilot and it seems they are not in business for a long time. I sent an email to business-class and told them Im not sure about them, this is their response: Thank you so much for adressing your concern regarding the tickets. Let you inform you that Business-Class.com does not sell mileage tickets booked using third party points. All our tickets are revenue ones and I have already mentioned you will be able to accrue mileage points (which is not possible on mileage bookings). In order to make you feel more confident and comfortable, I can create a reservation free of charge and provide you with the booking code. You can call the airline directly or check the reservation online in order to make sure it’s not a mileage booking and it’s 100% legit. After you get the confirmation we can go ahead and proceed with issuance of the ticket if you’d like to. Any advice on this?"
"A recent thread should provide you with the answers. I find it interesting both this thread and the one I've linked refer to the website name in the same way by including the '@' symbol before the website name, not that I'm suspicious in anyway of either thread. ;-)https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i…"
"Either way it's a sneaky way to win people's trust by creating a reservation and give people the chance to call the airline. But if you dig deeper in it, why would an airline sell cheaper business class tickets to travel agencies like this..."
I would Almost call foul on the OP as this is like said above @ but then again it's the poster 2 post.Edited: 1 year ago 
"Yeah looks like pretty thinly veiled advertising... In general I think anytime anyone posts a url, or part of one, in a title it should just be flagged without response to get it deleted."
There is no cheap air fare fairy.

Use google flights to see your options for your dates and route but book with the airline. If your dates are flexible just the days before and after as you can sometimes save doing that.
"Footprints, you need to read all the threads about “cheap” tickets then consider booking direct with the relevant airline to be sure that the price you see is the price you pay and it includes everything you need."
"@Footprints401179Should you consider buying a business class tickt not directly from the airline, then please come back here and ask for feedback BEFORE you buy them.As a reminder, if something is too good (or too cheap) to be true, it mostly is."

Hi so did you buy the tickets? This is a real or fake site?

Is Business-class.com is genuine travel site as they offer more or less same price for any date of travel
Is Business-class.com genuine website for air line bookings?
"read this thread and the thread linked to in post 1 and decide whether you want to gamble. Note mileage brokers break quite a few rules, airlines technology getting smarter and people have had flights cancelled...you decide"
"Suryanarayana M...#16 & #17 a few questions for you in case you are thinking of handing over your money.1. Have you read their terms and conditions? 2. Do you understand the risks of purchasing from a 3rd party? 3. Are they operating out of the same country in which you live and reside so you understand the trading laws if you need to sue them? 4. If I say yes they are a reliable site, will you fee reassured enough to hand over your money?5. Do you believe there is a business class airfare fairy?"
"Great questions, there, John. Think carefully about this, Suryanarayana. I wouldn't go anywhere near them."
To sum up John (#19): There really is NO Business Class Fairy
"WEQueen... au contraire, there is a business class cheap fare fairy, but the fairy only appears if you really really believe! The reason many travellers are disappointed that they do not secure the cheap business class fares is simply because they don't believe in the fairy enough.Edited: 4:35 pm, October 11, 2019 "
Did anybody try Business-Class.com? Expedia and Priceline have them on their flight search page.
Wendy can you provide a link to Rxpedia showing this mob on their site?I find it hard to believe they’d be advertising a mileage broker to buy flights from
"#23 all these sites work the same. The buy airline miles from person A, then they gift those miles to person B allowing them to purchase deep discounts on business class seats. Its not illegal, but its agaisnt many airlines terms of service, and more then once they have noticed that so and so has a discounted business class seat based on miles they never earned and they cancel the ticket no refund. I would not risk it."
"Did you use Business-class.com? If so, were you satisfied? I just booked a flight from San Diego to London and the price was very reasonable. British Air reservations show on British Air website, so I think it worked."
"Well you will not know if it worked until you have completed your trip ! Of course it will show on the BA website but if the airline are suspicious then someone will ask you questions before board. These are along the lines of how do you know the donor of the miles , their full name and address etc, if you can't answer then you don't fly.If this is a return then this process could happen in London on the way back"
"I agree with #27. They are mileage brokers and the airlines have the right to cancel your ticket at any time. There have been threads here from people who showed up at the airport, only to find their tickets cancelled. Selling frequent flyer miles is against the rules of every airline's mileage program, and they have gotten very good at spotting fradulent tickets."
"Please share how you know that are mileage brokers? The company is actually Business Travel Group LLC in Deerfield Beach, Fl. I checked BBB and they have had one complaint in the last year and it was resolved. Florida “sellers of travel” have to register with the Florida Dept of Agriculture. I checked with them and they have had no complaints, about the company."
"Their ""trustpilot"" reviews are very funny. A huge number of '5' over the last few days, all from one-post-wonders, all naming the wonderful person that they dealt with."
"No airline sells ""discount"" first and business class tickets. Yes, I know who they are. Their address is a ""virtual office center."" They are selling you a ticket purchased with someone else's frequent flyer miles. You may chose to believe this or not.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…Edited: 5:10 pm, January 26, 2020 "
"Actually British Air Tours (which you can reach by calling British Air) sells British Air business class seats at a substantial discount compared with buying them from British Air. Of course you have to buy a package which includes either a rental car or a hotel and return flight I just bought a package for less than ½ of the cost of the business class tickets. So I am canceling my business-class.com reservations, which were slightly less than the British Air tour price. So if anyone who reads this every actually use business-class.com I would be interested in hearing if it worked."
But there is no airline called British Air.
"'So I am canceling my business-class.com reservations' You're welcome to do so, but at a guess you didn't read the terms and conditions - especially para 3a - when dealing with this useless operation https://www.business-class.com/termsIf I cancelled an award ticket with BA the carrier would put the Avios back in my account less a fee for that. Since this lot have charged you X for an award ticket then they can claim the carrier hasn't refunded them and therefore there won't be any credit due to you especially after paying two sets of fees for a cancellation."
"Thanks. I know that, but I can't remember if it Airways or Airline."
"I canceled them within the 24 hours allowed by law, so hopefully, I won't have a problem :-)"
"My email exchange with business-class.com just ended with an email from them to me which contained the following ""I would like to let you know that the option which I have sent you over they are reward tickets which will be booked with our company miles and you do not accumulate miles on this flight and you are not allowed to make any changes or contact airline by yourself."" So, all of you who said they are mileage brokers were correct! In spite of my business class fairy wished!"
"'I canceled them within the 24 hours allowed by law, so hopefully, I won't have a problem :-)' Nope. The cancellation within 24 hours applies only to bookings made directly with the airline.Did you read the terms and conditions? You won't get any money back and you'll pay both BA and the ticket flogger hefty fees to receive a credit that may be as useful as the gift card for Mervyn's you found last week."
"There is no law that requires a third party to refund you money for cancellations within 24 hours, and it appears business-class.com will not be refunding your money, per their terms and conditions.This is what their webpage says about cancellations and refunds:"" Changes, cancellation and refunds are permitted up to 72 hours from time of departure. However, there will be a minimum of $250 per person processing fee plus any applicable fees charged by the carrier/provider upon cancellation/exchange. Fees will vary depending on the providers terms and conditions. You will not receive a monetary refund when canceling. Instead, you will receive a credit (less any airline/hotel fees) towards a future ticket purchase on long haul international flights of equal or greater value, which will be valid for up to twelve (12) months from your original date of purchase.""Edited: 9:02 pm, January 26, 2020 "
"Sadly, this is another example of someone misunderstanding that US law. It just goes to show that the old adage about a little knowledge being a dangerous thing was exactly right."
"I did read the terms and conditions. Since it did not address the issue of canceling within 24 hours, I contacted business-class.com and have an email saying my money would be refunded if I canceled within 24 hours. After I canceled I received a text saying the money would be returned in 5 to 7 business days. Stay tuned for an update next week!"
"That's good, but it is something hey have decided to do themselves. They are not required to do so by law."
"I wouldn't expect a any refund, if at all. Credit that is impossible to use will be your refund.I hope you had insurance, but I struggle to see how they would pay.This has the hallmarks of an expensive lesson."
Just to complete my experience. The refund was posted to my credit card account in 2 days.
"I would like to get some insight from people that actually used it. Not personal opinion without real experience which it appears to be mostly on here.I have been dealing with some of these companies while some seem sketchy some seem pretty legit in terms of operations. If they were so sketchy why are they are around this long? Trust pilot has over 1000 verified reviewed that marks them positive.They are registered with the travel industry and BBB. If they are shady wouldn't they be out of business by now?I have been in communication with Business-class.com and BCconsolidator and not all of their itineraries are cheap. I received some quotes that were a lot more than Amex travel.I think the companies that keep pushing you and keep calling you, you should avoid. The two I mentioned seem to be patient since I have been going back and forth with them for at least a month trying to find the itinerary.they also let you use your frequent mileage account to accumulate points.I would be interested in people's comments that actually used the service in the past."
"Fair enough Danny, but how do you know that anyone saying that they have used this company have really used them? And that counts whether the comments are positive or negative. The former could be shills and the latter employees of a competitor!"
"'Trust pilot has over 1000 verified reviewed that marks them positive.' Given that Trustpilot's credibility is near zero that means nothing.'They are registered with the travel industry and BBB.' Registered with what 'travel industry'? That they are registered with the BBB means they are ... registered with the BBB, nothing more.'If they are shady wouldn't they be out of business by now?' They should be, but they operate under the 'it may never happen' fingers crossed umbrella which can work but equally may not.What they do is not illegal but contravenes the terms and conditions of carriers' frequent traveller programs. Carriers are addressing these issues thoroughly with more sophisticated software and auditors who are reported as determined as well as immune to 'I didn't know' comments after the fact.. You may use these companies if you wish, but know the risks inherent when doing so."
"Danny T #47... failing reports from happy or unhappy customers, you are going to have rely on reading their terms and conditions carefully and weighing up how much risk you are prepared to take.Who you spend your money with is your decision, whatever you decide, hope it works out for you."
"Lets say 65% of their customers are satisfied and file positive reports at Trustpilot. Is that good enough, Danny?"
"So in other words over 30% Of their customers are not happy. LOLAnd of course trust pilot is not exactly trustworthy. don’t assume some other guy has a secret sauce, the only secret sauce is a way to separate you from your cash without deliveringEdited: 8:27 pm, February 18, 2020 "
Looking at reviews on TrustPilot is exactly the same as reading people's experiences here. You have no idea if you can trust them or not.
"Just to update from someone that just used the service. I just purchased 2 Business Class tickets to Sardinia one for myself and my companion, I fly out LA and she flies out of ATL.I have been going back and forth with my agent for almost a month going through different itineraries and finally found one that I wanted. She was never pushy unlike Skylux travel that called me 12x in a day, but you can't email anyone back.She was super patient because of my skepticism and I pointed all of these ""negative"" opinions out. She provided all of their accreditation to do business in the US ASTA, ARC, IATA, etc. and I validated that all the licenses are valid. She even let me confirm my bookings before I was charged for the tickets. I made the purchase and they had a security check to make sure it was me that owned the card.I was able to select my seats with United and Lufthansa, the bookings all were confirmed the only thing I saw was it was a First Class Restricted (p) which means a discounted fare which translates if we miss the flight due to mechanical failure and you want to be put on the next flight you may have to sit coach but if you can wait for the next you can get your business or first class seat but they disclose all of that before you book. Tix are NON Refundable, so you need to stick to your itinery and any changes will cost you.So at of right now, I saw nothing that would indicate anything being off or sketchy about the service plus I already saw United adding my frequent flyers miles as well Lufthansa which indicates a revenue ticket if you can earn points.I probably saved $1000 on business class tickets from the published fares. I got the business class on Lufthansa and First on United for the price of a economy plus regular.I guess the next litmus test actually taking the trip in July.The trust pilot reviews are being asked for after you purchase the tickets online, so most review it right after they get the tickets but not trip.This is my personal experience with Business Class.com so far so good, nothing shady throughout the process, agent super nice and accommodating, I was able to confirm my reservation, pick my seats and have my status confirmed, I am earning points, I was able to add it to my apps (United, Lufthansa). I would think something would have been wrong by now."
"If you look at the reviews for American Airlines itself, you should ask yourself why would anyone fly American ever but people do it daily."
Reading Danny’s post it’s very apparent that he is buying a mileage ticket. The fact that she had to keep going thru itineraries means she was looking for mileage tickets that she could sell him. This is very risky. But he was told that and decided to book anyway because there’s a cheap airfare fairy
Danny T... thanks for the update I for one appreciate it and pleased to see someone doing their homework before spending their money.
"""I was able to select my seats with United and Lufthansa, the bookings all were confirmed the only thing I saw was it was a First Class Restricted (p) which means a discounted fare which translates ......

They're not award fares, they're standard fares and you can get these directly from the airlines. There's nothing special about needing a third party.In 2017 I got a PDX-SFO-LHR P fare for $2,500 and flew in lie flat on the 747 upper deck, and in 2018 for $2,008 with lie flat all aisle access real Polaris. Both were booked directly from united.com. And I just looked at business class fares for this May and (while they're more expensive) P fares to London are $3,400, while the next fare bucket up (Z) is $4,100, so an $800 saving (close to what you are ""seeing"", and I'm sure there'll be $1000 savings elsewhere over the higher fare buckets).So there's nothing special here about using this combo. The fact that these tickets aren't bartered award tickets doesn't rule out that they sell them elsewhere. You're getting no benefit here over booking directly with the airline and still potentially problems of dealing with a middleman. Others could get landed in doo doo if they end up with bartered FF award tickets.Edited: 5:15 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"This is false and again, I like to correct comments like these because people make their conclusions based of false information and opinions.this is a revenue tickets, NOTHING states milage. I am able to get my frequent flyer miles with Lufthansa and United. I checked both sites that confirmed my ticket. I can see the receipt that shows that it was paid for and labeled as ""Bulk"".She checked various itineries for me because of my requests. I wanted to connect with my GF on one of the layovers so that we could fly together. I fly out of LA and she flies out of ATL and we are meeting in Chicago and have the same itinery going forward. When we get back to the states in Chicago is when we go our separate ways back to LA and ATL.I was looking at the layover times, airlines, etc and I requested all of these revisions including checking different dates and ranges to see if I can get better deals. Some of the itineries were not cheap but cheaper than going to the Airlines.My take was that they are just like a Travel Agency, you tell them what you want and they go out and find you the options. She probably provided me with 15 or so different options until I found the one that I was happy with and I did my due diligence.If my status with the airlines states ""confirmed"" and ""ticketed"" and I can choose my seats, in addition add my frequent flyer account and already get milage calculated once the trip is done. Not sure how anyone can say it's an award or milage ticket.I am an experience traveler with lots of miles, I usually only fly Delta domestic and only fly the top 10 carriers internationally. I received prices from Amex travel for my trip from $3200 - $3500 but I was able to get those for $2700.Anyways, here is my point. I am an ACTUAL customer of this company, that just dealt with them the past 3 - 4 weeks. Just bought my tickets through them and was able to do everything the same as with an airline vs. everyone else on here that never used the service to have an educated opinion. I am a business owner myself and I see how spreading of false information and just off the cuff opinions without any experience can cost small business lots of money. But most of the comments here about this company have been false and none of it was true including reading the TOS.They offer refunds, they provide conflict resolution and they are very explicit of the do's and don't's. Not once was I told not to contact the airline, matter of fact they told me to contact the airline to confirm the tickets and reservation. There was never any hiding or instructing me to say something other than I bought my tickets.You don't have to use it, but the OP asked if this was a legitimate company and after my experience and interaction, it is. I don't think that all of their prices are too good to be true because half of the itinerary were not cheaper or similar as going to the airline or even Amex."
"""This is false and again, I like to correct comments like these because people make their conclusions based of false information and opinions.this is a revenue tickets, NOTHING states milage. ""====================That's exactly what I said! I said nothing false. P fares are revenue tickets. But you don't need any third party to get them You could have got those fares and tickets directly from the airline if you had tried checking. There was *no benefit* whatsoever in using this combo, as there were genuine revenue tickets available cheaply. That doesn't say they'll always provide legit revenue tickets; on routes where the P fares have sold out or are still pretty high they'll go the shonky mileage broker route, as the person in #37 confirmed."
"""I already saw United adding my frequent flyers miles as well Lufthansa which indicates a revenue ticket if you can earn points>It has been several years since I flew United, but every other airline I've flown will add the FF miles AFTER you have taken the flight, not when you book your ticket, so is United different now?Edited: 1:07 am, February 23, 2020 "
"""but every other airline I've flown will add the FF miles AFTER you have taken the flight""No.You give them your FF number before you fly (at booking or check-in). The miles get credited after the flight. You can also request a credit after a flight, but that will be a bit more complicated."
"Phil, I think we are in agreement. The FF number is added to the account at the time of booking or check-in, while the actual miles are posted after the flight. I took his statement in #54 to mean that he already saw the actual miles added to the account."
"No. I said that I can see what my flights will yield in points AFTER.I think it is delusional to debate with people that NEVER used the service and argue their opinion, that is the state of affairs we have entered.What is your qualifications to speak on this topic in the first place ""All assumptions, speculations and wrong information"".Again, I just purchased $6000 worth of tickets with the company for an upcoming trip. I am sharing my experience with the OP who asked if they are legitimate and wanted feedback on the process. Since NONE of you purchased or used the service, how can you provide any feedback?To the OP, I haven't seen anything fishy during my process and all itineraries were not ""cheaper"" or ""to good to be true"" it depends on the airline, where you are going, how many layovers and how long the layovers are. I saw the better prices are with long overnight layover and several changes some include airport changes and self check-in. I had them give me over 15 different options from Swiss, United, Delta, KLM, Alitalia, Iberia and some budget airlines.My process took almost a month. All of it was done via email even though my agent called and texted to follow up but nothing super aggressive unlike Skylux who blew me up 11x a day, with emails from a Herman that most likely doesn't exists, emails bounce back but they will call you 5x a day daily which turned me off.Also here is the copy / paste from my United account in regards to the my mileage earning for my upcoming trip which gives you exactly how much you will be getting once you COMPLETE your trip.-------------------MileagePlus EarningsFlight Award miles PQF PQPLAX - CAG 7,796 3 1,560CAG - LAX 7,796 3 1,560Total 15,592 6 3,120Award miles shown are the miles that can be earned for this flight.

"Thank you, USBusiness Traveler for that information."
"Well best of luck Danny T. I'm sure everything will be fine. According to their terms and conditions https://www.business-class.com/terms ""if your ticket is not honored for any reason, please contact your agent immediately"" and they'll sort it out for you within 24 hours or give you a refund. I guess sometimes the airlines don't ""honor"" the tickets they sell for whatever reason."
"Horrible, horrible people! Booked airfare for a BIG trip to South Africa for a photo safari. Because of the COVID-19 crisis, the trip was cancelled. When I contacted the for a refund, they told me $800 cancellation fee would have to be charged up front, then I would get a refund of $4,600. Called airlines, and the cancellation fee was TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. and would be deducted from my refund, which was, after the fee, $4,400. So these people wanted me to give them $800 ON TOP of the fare of $4,600, in order to get back $4,600. SERIOUSLY? I feel SO bad for the people who trust these folks. NEVER again for me!"
"Steph1953You appointed them as your agents and they can charge any fees they want that are set out in the terms and conditions you agreed - if the fee is not listed contact your credit card company, if it's in the t & c then it's tough luck."
"Not necessary....airlines were very unhappy about what had been told me and said it was a scam. Airlines refunded ALL but $200.....NEVER, NEVER, NEVER again. It it seems like too good of a deal, it probably is!"
"I booked with them and my reservation was on the airline's website per the booking I was given, so I would say there is not a problem with this vendor."
One question I have which someone might answer is: I will be receiving a voucher from Air Canada usable for one year due to cancellation. Would I be able to use that voucher on a Star Alliance partner to fly later?
FrankI suspect you have posted on the wrong thread but what you can do will depend on the terms of the voucher
"Here's my experience with Business-class.com as of May 2020:NOT a trust worthy company!!Booked a trip to Scotland via United Airlines for end of June. Business Class notified me in May that the flight is cancelled by United Airlines, but refuses to issue a full refund. They claim United Airlines is only willing to issue travel credit for 24 months and waive change flight fees/rebooking fees. United Airline's own policy is to issue full refund if the airline cancels a flight and US Department of Transportation also requires airlines to issue full refund when flight is cancelled; however, Business Class keeps claiming they simply follow airline policy and are not willing to issue refunds. As it turns out, Business Class is the company that is holding my money hostage and not willing to issue a refund. Have filed a dispute with my credit card company, but save yourself some trouble and stay away from Business-Class.com"
"**update as of 6/3/20**I disputed the charge with my credit card and received an email threat from Business-Class.com as follow:""We have, unfortunately, had a large increase in chargebacks these last few months and we have won every single one of them because we have the supporting documentation.Please understand that if you do not agree to settle this then you are risking losing the total amount that was charged as well we will no longer offer you the future credit for the next 2 years. This is not what we want. Every travel agency is dealing with this and most clients are understanding and accepting the credit."""
I would forward that to your bank
This should also go to the US Department of Transportation because they have specific directions regarding this.
"I think you find that DoT directions apply to airlines operating in or to the USA, but not to disreputable online ticket sellers."
DoT have no authority over third party ticket floggers.
You're incorrect. The dept. has everything to do with flights which originate in the USA or those international airlines which connect in the US. You can go to the US Dept. Transportation and pull this up.
"The DoY sets requirements for airlines, not for travel agencies based outside the USA."
"And the current leadership of federal departments is markedly anti-consumer, so don’t get your hopes up"
"I think you're wrong, Frank, because crappy outfits like this one don't operate any flights at all. They are not an airline."
"Business-Class.com is based out of Fort Lauderdale and my round trip tickets are for US to Scotland and back to US.. besides, their own web site has a refund policy if tickets were canceled (I made copy of that policy already). They basically are trying to bully their customers to finance their failing operations. They could give their customers choices to receive a voucher or a full refund, as a responsible business would do. My business and personal finance are being affected by Covid19 also, but I won't go around and hold my customers' money hostages. Honestly, I think they know they can't survive this downturn and they probably trying to hold on to as much cash as they could before going out of business."
"Interesting theory, boc, but this thread is well over a year old. They've just been a terrible company for a long time.Never ascribe to malice what can be chalked up to incompetence."
Just pull up the U.S. Dept. Transportation and you will see the regulations regarding flight from and to the US regardless of how the ticket was purchased. Makes no difference if you bought you ticket from an airline or travel agency. Just read it.
You keep saying this. Have you got a link that says that agencies count?
"'Please understand that if you do not agree to settle this then you are risking losing the total amount that was charged as well we will no longer offer you the future credit for the next 2 years.' Annoying but accurate. Since business-class.com flog tickets acquired with miles or points rather than revenue tickets, there won't be a refund from the carriers for cancelled bookings which is why bc-c offer a future credit.You haven't got a revenue ticket and as such there isn't anything for the carrier to refund. What you paid bc-c is their price for the ticket as they'd paid someone else for the miles or points used to make the booking.It's an iffy way to purchase tickets at best and in the current circumstances the downsides of using this type of ticket flogger are even greater than usual."
I just type in U.S. Dept. Transportation and then look for airline refunds due to COVID-19 virus. It's all there in black and white.
"OK so I did that and found https:/…refundsIs that what you mean?On that page it says :""The refund/reservation requirement for airlines does not apply to tickets booked through online travel agencies, travel agents, or other third-party agents.""Pretty plain to me!"
DoT...that’s for people who have booked directly with an airline. A dreadful third-party ticket flogging website is not an airline.
Let me see if I have the page and I will reference.
"#85...A lot of people are under the assumption that the mandate means full cash refunds for everyone and that is just not the case. This means US based airlines must cash refund all customers who bought their ticekts before the outbreak whos flights are canceled because of the outbreak. This does however not mean that airlines have to refund sketchy things like multiple one way tickets (except for the specific legs canceled) they don't have to accommodate you if you have multiple airlines booked, again only canceled flights...I could go on and on but, these low cost business class ticket websites get their prices by using other peoples flyer miles which totally violates the TOS of the airlines which in my understanding clears the airline of any legal requirement to refund a ticket. Its just another of the long long list of reasons to buy tickets directly from the airline."
"As already stated, this company is not subject to DOT regulations regarding refunds; they are a third party agent and not an airline. And, they purchased other people's frequent flyer miles and use those to book your ticket. This is against the rules of every airline's frequent flyer program and if the airline finds out this is how your ticket was obtained, it will be canceled.With these mileage tickets, if the flight is canceled, there isn't a refund to send to business-class.com. Often, when you book these tickets, the terms and conditions state that if the flight or tickets are canceled, you agree you have no recourse against the company.
