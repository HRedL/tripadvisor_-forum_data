"Hello, We are hopefully travelling to Havana for our Honeymoon on the 29th March, not sure whats going to happen when we get off the plane, How they are testing people coming in to the country, we don't want to travel all that way to be locked in a hospital for our entire holiday. Would appreciate anyone who has recently been and what they have experienced at the airportsThank you"
Both provincial and federal governments are making announcements today regarding international travel at 11:00 am and 1:00 pm respectively ......will have a better idea then if flights are even going.
You should cancel! The Canadian government has warned everyone to come home. You will have no medical insurance and no government repatriation. You will be in hospital if suspected of infection. Bring lots of cash and your medication for at least a month past your trip. You will be ordered to spend 14 days in self- isolation after your trip.
"Since you are from UK, it is reported that you face jail time if you refuse being tested when needed or refusing quarantine. I think many countries are taking serious measures in light of the serious global situation. There are reported at least 149 cases in Cuba. Things are changing minute by minute."

DON’T GO!"
I have been in Cuba for almost three months now and have changed my flight plans to go home early. STAy HOME. If you become ill whilst in Cuba you face horrendous health conditions in hospitals and huge costs.

"The Canadian Government has stated they will not bring Canadians home if they get stranded.Just imagine if you get to Cuba and then the flight attendants union on your carrier refuse to work anymore because of the virus risk. You will be stuck in Cuba for who knows how long. Plus when you enter Canada now, you will have to agree you will self-quarantine for 14 days or they will not process you."
"amy b:I assume that you are flying with Virgin Atlantic? It's quite possible that flights could well be cancelled before that date. Their website is of little use as it doesn't mention travel to Cuba and only to contact them if your flight is within the next 72 hours, which yours is not."
"Dear Marlene #3:Your statement is wrong.There are ONLY FOUR cases within Cuba already diagnosed positive; and none it is sick BTW. They are all evolving positively.Dear Candysita # 5:Really? Horrendous health conditions in hospitals?All those within quarantine and the ones already diagnosed positively reported yesterday on National TV they are being treated like they would not be treated in their own countries. It is obvious to me that your sources of information are a bit out of touch because precisely the facilities dedicated to deal with this new threat over here are the best ones available in the country.It is good to offer personal opinions without the need to inflate and create panic while trying to discredit my country’s prestige. Yes, it looks like you wil do a big favor to us if you go back home earlier than expected IMHO."

sorry Voy. many of us also have contacts through out cubaand we are hearing far more cases than cuba is reporting. even our own countries are not on top of things. carol e.
"Yes carol, it wouldn't take long for Cuba's health system to be overwhelmed, right now they are trying to protect their tourism and they are desperate for money. Spoke with a friend there and he said difficult to find any type medicine and even food"
All those within quarantine and the ones already diagnosed positively reported yesterday on National TV they are being treated like they would not be treated in their own countries. Voy really what do you expect them to say . Im sure your National TV is not biases at all to your government they just tell it like it is .
Dear Cubacarol:I have no reasons at all to disbelief what my country’s Public Health Organization reports on daily basis. I am not “hearing” “things” from my contacts although I know many “tings” are being “said”. It is a false assumption to give credit to any innuendos spread about our authorities hiding any information. That’s not a common practice over here (I mean in Cuba) especially when a matter for our National Security it is in the picture. For an island like ours this virus is a matter of serious National Security.But everybody is free to believe whatever….from whoever…..I guess…
Dear #12:You talked to a “friend” or a “fren”?Really no medicine or food in here?
"Things are changing rapidly. Any presumptive cases are considered as cases. In Canada we have been told to self-isolate for 14 days after trip. We have been advised to get home NOW or suffer consequences. We may even have to close our borders. Even snowbirds in Florida are coming home. Medical insurance will not cover treatment for virus. The Canadian government will not help repatriate our citizens. In my province, all schools and daycare centres, cinemas, theatres, casinos, libraries, many restaurants are closed. People 70 and over have been ordered to stay indoors. Yes, we started with 4 cases and now over 377. The majority are from people who travelled out of the country. Now we have been advised that it is spreading through the community. We are frightened. We see the latest from Italy. They ordinarily have world class response. They have had to make battle field decisions such as deciding whether to give a ventilator to a 75 year old a 20 year old. Silly me is afraid. How do resort workers social-distance or not get the virus and spread to their families when they are being paid to make tourists happy? This is not about national pride or confidence in one’s health system. Things are moving rapidly in a very bad direction."
"Six days ago our Prime Minster, a Vice-Prime Minster in charge of Health issue s nationwide and the Minister of Public Health spent two hours on TV explaining to our people on prime time TV our Plans; and I have seen and verified personally at the level of my own neighborhood, family and friends nationwide those plans being implemented. I did not “hear” them from a “friend”. I am witnessing them."
"Six days ago !!,Johnny C"
"In all countries of the world, patients are kept confidential. Nobody has been interviewed. The only mention is the age, sex, and source of being Infected, and condition. This follows international standards and internationally followed. All I can say is be very careful. With 4 cases during a pandemic, I would be extremely fearful and take care of my family, particularly the seniors."
"Post #17...PLEASE do not take offence from what I am going to say...If the rest of the ENTIRE world cannot get it right, WHY, do you think that CUBA is? As someone else just posted, that was 6 days ago! You personally do NOT have access to all the going on in your country (just as I don’t in mine). How can you possibly feel that you can be a representative of Cuba and what may or may not be going on in your hospitals or how tourists may or may not be handled in your health care system. You are absolutely correct though on one of your past quotes...the tourist should get out, and get out NOW. Your countries resources SHOULD be spent on your own citizens to keep them safe and healthy. All tourists have the option of being home and cared for in their own countries. They are being totally selfish right now putting any possible stress on your government and your healthcare system whether it be the best in the world of fragile due to lack of funds and supplies. Try not to feel that you are getting sucked in to be the person to defend your beautiful country. That’s my 2cents for what it is worth.Edited: 1:26 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Because this virus may spread before a person is symptomatic, it's likely there are quite a few more cases that have not been discovered yet. If you have an R0 of 2, then 1 case becomes 2 becomes 4 becomes 8 becomes 16, etc. Not long before you have a very high number, which is why social distancing is so important, even before a person is symptomatic."
"It's a no brainer at this point....I doubt you'll even find a plane. This is far from over...we all need to do our part right now...that is cancel. I know, we're all very disappointed and can't believe this is really happening right now...it's like a movie or it surely will be one :)"
"We arrived back from Varadero to Toronto on the 14th.We counted 41 passegers disembark from the WestJet flight from Calgary. That plane has ~ 300 seats which were full when we left Varadero for Toronto.. This means very few people arriving, and max # leaving.the resort we were at occupancy was down 30% and I think that number will continue to drop as fewer people travel.It will be quiet - the resorts will scale back staffing, services etc. to a bare minimum.If you go, take lotsa money, credit cards, medicines, hand santizer andf be perpared to stay longer then you expect,Canada is resticting flight from international locations to 5 airports.Things have not reached a peak yet.think really seriously and assess ALL risks before you go anywhere rigth now. - (medical insurance coverage, medical availabiltiy in Cuba, costs, longe term health complications, will you enjoy being there if things close down? I'd defer travel for now."

Just watch the news. Stay home for the best odds of a long marriage!
"Also should be concerned getting back,you might spread the virus without knowing it,,,,"
Re Posts 24 &25:That is a wonderful gesture by the Cuban Government.I've not seen any mention of it so far in the UK Media.
"why did the British cruise ship not go to Miami and dock? , trumpet won't let even his own citizen dock in US ports if they have the virus if he had it his way, no white people with the virus in the USA he said.Edited: 9:24 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Our glorious leader said today if you show any signs of the virus before you get on the plane you are not getting on it. No back to Canada for you.
"My take on this evolving situation.... obviously the problem of still traveling to Cuba and back is not yet as bad as what many are making it out to be, otherwise our government would not still be allowing Canadians to travel to Cuba and elsewhere in the Caribbean.It might get that way eventually, sure... but as of right now, it's still perfectly within everyone's right to book and go. Many will still think they know better, or are just downright too scared. But when you cut to the quick, it's still allowed... albeit with certain new protocols in place to be addressed both in Cuba and once back in Canada.To each their own. I'm still going on April 18th... if allowed. I realize that other's situations are different than mine too. It's a personal choice for everyone given their circumstances. But there's absolutely nothing selfish about still going if our government and Cuba's government are working in tandem to help keep us all safe while allowing us to continue traveling to the island and back. If anyone has a problem with that, direct your complaints to our government, and not me.Terry"
You will eventually talk yourself into going and thinking its the right thing to do . Just keep on talking . Johnny C
"People should start thinking about the over all situation as well as others. Here is an interesting article: https:/…1584350270_13897.html The most interesting part is this one: ""Por otra parte, quien ""maliciosamente propague o facilite la propagación de una enfermedad, incurre en sanción de privación de libertad de tres a ocho años"". Which essentially reads as ""On the other hand, whoever ""maliciously spreads or facilitates the spread of disease, incurs a punishment of deprivation of liberty for three to eight years""Now that everyone knows about the disease and travel restrictions and advisories, it could become interesting if you happen to be identified as patient 0 in a zone...Edited: 1:05 am, March 17, 2020 "
"This thread seems to have hit a peak in misinformation and misinterpretation. And what the Canadian government says or does is not relevant to the OP.But several of you are mis-stating or misinterpreting what your government is doing.Terry - how do you plan to get to Cuba ? (By the way - doesn’t your government still allow you to fly to Europe).Amy - certainly best not to travel if you have a fever. They have thermal scanners in the airport and check all arrivals.)Edited: 4:36 am, March 17, 2020 "
"beardo, at the moment, Sunwing and Air Transat are still both flying to Holguin... not my preferred destination, of course. WestJet is now out for my targeted April 18th departure date. I haven't booked yet and would much prefer Air Transat with their later in the day arrival and departure times. Not sure about flights out of Canada to Europe as my only focus is on Cuba.Terry"
You won't be flying anywhere Terry...time to face reality.
Anyone who ignores the general advice to avoid all non essential travel is a selfish moron.
Oh sure now you agree with me :)
"No worries... my travel to Cuba is essential.Lucky, when did the authorities put you in charge of suspending flights?Terry"
I have a commonsensical view of the near future Terry...we all know you wanna go....reality says you'll have to wait.

"A friend is currently stranded in Morocco, trying to get back to the UK. The British Ambassador tweeted this morning:“BA, Easyjet, TUI and Ryanair are flying in to Marrakesh and Agadir over the next three days. I had intended to send out the schedule. But the flight times keep changing and I did not want to mislead you. So the best thing is now contact your airline & try register with them.Seats will be allocated to those who hold return tickets with the airline. There are additional seats available on some flights.The flights will continue until Thursday. After midnight on Thursday, there will be no more flights.”*****All planes are to fly to Morocco with NO passengers. Flight crew must stay onboard while the departing passengers board. No exceptions.If anyone thinks that isn’t going to similar soon for Canadians coming back from overseas, they are in la-la land.Edited: 6:06 am, March 17, 2020 "
Yep!!!
"I would think anyone with ""essential"" travel to Cuba would be leaving now, and not planning on coming back any time soon, given the current situation. It's extremely unlikely, IMO, that flights will resume in April....."
"What is non-essential travel? Excerpt from a British article on the subject as follows... There is a grey area concerning the definition of non-essential travel.The British Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not lay out exactly what the phrase means.Instead, FCO says: ""whether travel is essential or not is your own decision. You may have urgent family or business commitments to attend to. Circumstances differ from person to person.""In its travel advice guidance, the FCO goes on to say only an individual can make the decision as to whether travel is essential.In other words, it is up to a person to determine whether travel is important enough to override travel advice.Terry"
"Enjoy your “essential” visit to Cuba Terry...Absolutely no one at this point really cares what you choose to do. We hope you are safe, enjoy yourself, and get back home (eventually), healthy."
Actually many of us care about selfish individuals flouting the essential travel advice. Hopefully most governments will make that more stringent because of those fools.
Why are people reporting these posts leave them up they have the same right as you do even if you don't agree with what they post .As for canceling a trip not a big deal for me anyway i would never put my family or any other person at risk .I would never forgive myself if something would happen because of a stupid vacation that i can always take later

"Thanks for that, gat0. Some just want to silence me, even though there's absolutely nothing wrong with what I have posted. Terry"
"@53: going to the beach and traveling for leisure is clearly non-essential travel. The grey areas would he more like checking on a secondary home, visiting a close relative, and some business related travel for example. Also there’s an interesting article in the Cuban papers about the law and possible consequences: https:/…1584350270_13897.htmlIt provides for possible penalties for those that would not collaborate with authorities and even this: “whoever maliciously spread or facilitate the spread of disease, incurs a punishment of deprivation of liberty for three to eight years.""Where I live someone who refuses to self isolate and spreads the disease around could also technically be sued for negligence at this point: with all the warnings and requests from governments it not like they are doing it unknowingly."
Amy b What do you think you will do? We are in a similar position but as it stands within the UK we will lose all our money if we don’t go. We need the Foreign Office either to say no travel or Cuba to not let people in!
"@54... Instead, FCO says: ""whether travel is essential or not is your own decision. You may have urgent family or business commitments to attend to. Circumstances differ from person to person.""That statement actually supports those who are recommending that trips to Cuba should be cancelled due to non-essential travel... as much as it also supports my personal decision to continue to travel to Cuba due to urgent family commitments, as I have. That certainly helps to bring clarity to that issue for those who have not cancelled their vacays yet, and for those others who already have too. In the end, my decision will likely be made for me with the cancellation of flights, so anyone's objection of my family visit will inevitably be moot.Terry"

"Terry, whatever you decide I suspect you will be in the country of your choice for a lot longer than a few months. I think all the short term cancellations/suspensions of flights/border closings/self-isolations etc. will probably be extended for more months than at present. Of course, I don't have a crystal ball but nothing I've been reading makes me think this will be over in a couple of months."
There are many foreigners now in quarantine in Cuba. Can you really entertain the thought of possibly getting quarantined there??
It’s been reported by others booked to travel that Virgin are now starting cancelling flights to Havana
"# 61 ..,It wouldn't surprise me if all international flights are starting to cancel.., sadly it seems that the world is starting to shut down.PVChick.., I wouldn't want to be quarantined in the US right now either."
"I really wish people would listen and do their part. This is way more serious than we think...people are dying! Governments around the world are reacting big time! Our Province of Ontario is in a state of public emergency as of yesterday...more closures, no large gatherings, reduced store hours, borders closed etc...this is what the World needs to be doing right now! Lets stay calm and smart and at home...it is panic time I'm afraid!"
"Lucky problem is many people don't listen and could not care less what the government says .My daughter in law is a nurse works in an emergency Hospital in Montreal they need to put Security at the door to control people coming in .They ask if for the sick to come alone and of course most of them come with other people which they will not let them in which is great .No visiting hours at the hospital well people try to visit anyways and to get in they try to say they are going for tests .Now at the door they have the Security guard they had to put somebody else who will take your name and see what king of exam they have for that day and of course most of them have none and get kicked out of the Hospital ,We tell our kids not to lie but it seems for parents its ok and it does not matter if you bring the virus into a Hospital no big deal for these creeps ."
