"Hi all, I will be travelling in a group of 4 from Malaysia to Perth in early of Sep this year. We had submitted our Visa application 2 months before and just got to know that one of our friend's application was rejected. They required additional information to be sent to them. So she had sent all the additional information and it has been said that the application has been refer to Australia High Commission. My question is, is there any method or way that i can call to follow up the status? Thank you."
"Hi, I am travelling to Perth this coming mid of September.I was recently rejected as well, however my friends of 4 got the green light.I am a small startup that began it's operations since April this year and, with small companies, earnings may not be so bright in the early days. Thus I had been administering a salary of RM 2,500 from my company. However, I had other streams of income eg projects, freelancing jobs and so on.I was rejected based on the reason that my salary ""is not attractive enough"" to make sure I return to Malaysia upon the expiry of my Visa, which I think is very unfair due to the fact that the company had recently started operating (about 3 months). And because the Home Affairs had requested to view statements of only 3 months.On my bank statements, it may show figures less than RM 10,000 but it was also due to the fact that :1) I've paid all my expenses for the trip (Accommodation, car rental, Insurance, Flight Tickets, all for 15 days worth of trip) 2) I've prepared a significant amount of AUD which I believe will be enough for the entire trip, I have also prepared a good amount of USD and MYR in cash just in case. 3) I've previously travelled to S.Korea, Taiwan and Thailand earlier this year, and someone had to pay for the trips and that guy is myself.The person who rejected my application had never considered :1) My assets (car)2) My investments (Forex, FD)3) My cash on handThe person who rejected the application should be questioned as the rejection resulted in a ""No further consideration"" for my application. This in my opinion is a serious misuse of authority as they had not provide means of appealing / rectify the situation.I will now proceed with the other Visa (Tourist Stream Class 600) with a fee of AUD 140 with VFSGlobal, hoping by providing a fuller detail on my background and show why I won't ""discard"" my properties and inheritance here just to go pluck fruits in Australia."
"Hi Luigi,Thank you for commenting, and yes I've gone through your previous post and the rest of the thread.I managed to save up a lot during 2017 as I could not travel due to a back problem. The previous job I had was a great one; I was greatly compensated due to achieving my sales target most of the time. It was because of passion (I love photography) and the temptation to start owning a business for myself that made me eventually leaving the company. I consider myself a frequent traveller as I would usually travel to 2 countries at least every year. However, back to the point, I understand that most of the illegal immigrants are probably Malaysians, but to reject my application like that and without providing grounds to appeal is like over the line. Since there was ""no further consideration"" for my ETA application, and after consulting with VFSGlobal and a friend from the embassy, I am guessing the best I could apply is the Tourism Stream Class 600 which will cost me 7 times what the ETA would.BTW Luigi, they've asked me to fill up a form 1419 and attach relevant documents before passing to VFSGlobal which they will submit to the Embassy. There is a section referring to ""Sponsors"" and I was hoping to include my parents to act as ""anchors"" to prove that I will be back before the visa expires.My question is, if you have the insight, are my parents considered as ""Sponsor""s? I've seen the definition listed in the Embassy website that they have to Australian. If the answer is No, is there a way to include my parents to prove that I will back in time.I would ask VFSGlobal but their operating hours are pretty short and they have since closed 4 hours ago. I would have to wait to call them on Monday but I've made an appointment to submit my Form 1419 by Monday 930am.Once again, many many thanks for commenting. It frustrates the hell out of me because I had been to Australia for at least 4 times in my short life."
"Thank you Luigi,Guess I have to include more documents to back my financial background then. From the previous threat, I’ve noticed many mentioned “ETA” being rejected at first but eventually got granted.Any idea if their “2nd application” was indeed ETA or a class 600 Tourist Visa?"
"Yes exactly, I was requested a set of documents ie bank statements, my small startup financial statements etcAnd was rejected after that.I am really hoping that my Class 600 Visa will get approved, I just don’t see what other logical excuses can they throw at me except the fact that I am the boss of my mini startup and thus, the low salary. But it doesn’t reflect my actual total income, like I mentioned I have freelancing jobs and projects as well and they do contribute to my financial health. I’ll proceed with the Form 1419 and attach the relevant documents, try to sweeten my way up to a Visa somehow.But seriously I think they have to review and amend their system for screenings especially Malaysians. The way they do it now is not fair. I don’t mind for them to collect a security bond from my family members / impose a heavier consequences on them but they have to open up the term “Sponsor” to be non-Australians as well. I would say currently this is a case of discrimination over Malaysians."
"I understand your frustration but life isn't always fair and sometimes others' actions muck it up for innocent parties.You can call it discrimination if you wish but as Luigi has stated, there is a reason why Malaysians are being heavily reviewed and having visas declined. You don't have to like it,but it's the right of any country to pick and choose who visits and who doesn't."
"It’s unfortunate for you, but any “discrimination” may be against countries whose residents’ Visa overstays is high.As has been noted in this & other threads, Malaysia is one of those countries. If your countrymen didn’t outstay their Visas so regularly, you may not be having your current difficulty. Just conjecture, of course."
"“But seriously I think they have to review and amend their system for screenings especially Malaysians. The way they do it now is not fair. I don’t mind for them to collect a security bond from my family members / impose a heavier consequences on them but they have to open up the term “Sponsor” to be non-Australians as well.”Actually, we don’t. Our country, our rules.Same as yours.And, by the way, with the greatest possible respect, why on earth would we amend our screening system “ especially for Malaysians”? Apart from apparently being top Visa overstayers, what’s so special about Malaysians that they should warrant amendment of our entry assessment?"
"Dear all, thank you for commenting and share on this.As to the high volume of overstayers, yes I agree, we have plenty of illegal immigrants here as well and we do not like it one bit. However, these immigrants are subjected to spot checks every now and then. And for employers who hire them, they will be slapped with high fines. But there should be no need of generalisation. There should be a well thought out process to assist the screening of eligible tourists. What makes us Malaysian special? I don’t feel one bit special or outstanding, I’m only pointing to the needless generalisation applied on random males (apparently from other threads as well) Should the tourists able to provide sufficient info on their “intent to return” upon expiry of visa, then rejected applications should be given avenues to appeal instead of an ultimatum."
"Cheap or free electronic visas will use modelling and auto decisioning to process an application. You were flagged up by that for manual processing. You provided more information which a human being looked up and they decided you were too high a risk to approve. That was based on the information you provided about you.Based on what you e posted, your nationality is a high risk of overstaying; your small income suggests a higher risk of working illegally or not being able to fully fund your trip and become a burden on the state. They probably also consider you as not having strong ties to return,I getbthat you don’t like it but a country has every right to determine how w,any and what type of visitors it wants and to set its screening criteria a accordingly. The only country any of us have a right of entry to is our own country, entry into any other country is a privilege not a right.No country is going to design a bespoke customised screening service that will suit what you want. You’re welcome to spend the fees on a visa 600 which will involve more manual asssessment but there is a good chance that will also be denied.It really is best to get permission to travel first before any travel arrangements are made."
"Bravo, Luigi!“You - as a group- need to follow our rules if you want to visit our country.”"
"Dear Luigi,Good morning, thank you for coming back on this.Well like I said, no need for generalisation. To handle the issue of overstaying, the government of Australia should look into their processes and determine the suitable steps to screen and ensure no such cases happen again, instead of slapping an ultimatum without proper investigation. There are GENUINE Travellers like myself as well. Right now it seems as though I am accused of a crime I did not / won't commit (with proven evidences if permitted) and convicted to a sentence without a TRIAL or APPEAL. Sounds fair?"
"Hi guys, just an update from me on this situation.My ETA got approved after my 2nd application with sufficient documentation, took me 13 working days including public holiday.So for Malaysians who are viewing this thread, just follow the steps listed in :https:/…20CommissionThere is also another forum (in Malay) that provided me very informative ideas and steps to get around with the situation, just PM me and I'll share with you there.Make sure to provide MORE THAN ENOUGH documents even if they do not require you to, documents to include : Assets (FD, Vehicles owned, Family business etc etc)And don't worry if you got rejected, apparently Malaysians are not the only ones, people from Canada and UK got rejected too :)Oh and if you got rejected the first time, there's no harm trying the second time. Ignore people who say the results will be the same regardless. Just provide more than enough info and documents and you should be alright.All the best and good luck!Edited: 2 years ago "

"Hello Joann L,I was face same issue. my ETA application also rejected by Australia Travel Authority the i flow the rejection email instruction and submit required documents. After that i wait few days but i did not received any response from Australia Travel Authority then i applied with this https://www.etasupport.com.my/ website. this website service was very good. they help me to complete application via online chat. they also have another website https://www.australiaeta.com.my/ but visa fee is high 25 RM where fist website fee is only 20 RM. after apply my visa i was received within 8 hours. i got released :)"
"Hi Toh Lay Koon..My husband visa was rejected as well and we are suppose to go next week. Didn't see its coming. We had submitted the supporting documents to Travel Authority last week but there is no response. Can i know that when your ETA application was rejected, you did submitted the supporting documents as requested and still did not received any response?Did you submit another application through https://www.etasupport.com.my/ website? If yes, i may want to try that. Any response from Australia Travel Authority after that? Thanks."
Post #28 is clearly an agent promoting their website; a first time poster digging up an old thread to tell how applying thru a certain non governmental website has helped them get a visa.
Hi Syikin.Im facing the same issue. More than a week now. Have u found any other way to follow up? Thanks
They can use their fg brain to create a system to properly assess not randomly reject Use their l brain

"When everyone thought it was the end of the road for me, I proved them all wrong.I got ETA approved within ~14 days after I submit my 2nd application via email to the Hi Comm, immediately a day after I got my 1st application rejected.Keep trying no matter the odds. But please do it before you book your flights / accommodations so to minimize any losses if your ETA got rejected.Just provide solid proof of your assets, commitments etc, things that will tell any person with 10 IQ that you will be back from this trip. Decent amount of savings in your bank, EPF statements, properties, vehicles, your family ties, FD, investments whatever you can include, just include in your submission.For those Malaysians who abused the ETA by overstaying, working illegally etc, I really hope you'll get karma, because you guys gave Malaysians some serious bad impressions among the Australians.I do hope the Australian government will impose stricter penalties on those who abuse.Once again good luck to all GENUINE Malaysian tourists, we love Australia as it's beautiful. peace"
"Hi, they reply exactly after 14 days? is that 14 working days or including weekend."
Hai..I read about your situation and may I know how it go with the visa?

"So back to the point, may i know how did you guys sorted out/manged to get your ETA tourist visa approved as recently my brother applied for my whole family and unfortunately only both my brothers had not been granted for the ETA tourist visa but the rest did. Would greatly appreciated to hear the suggestion/advice from you on how successful your visa been granted the end. They had booked the flight way earlier and do not wish to burn off as well.

Malaysia. Why?
"Well because Malaysians overstay their ETAs at a far higher rate than any other nationality that are eligible to apply for them. This means that their is far greater scrutiny of applications from Malaysians, especially those that fit the profile of those most likely to either overstay or breach visa conditions (by working).Might have to go down the visa 600 route although doesn’t sound like there is sufficient time for it to be processed before the planned travel date.This is why everyone including the Australian government, advises applying in advance before booking anything. If a visa isn’t granted, there is still time to try alternatives.."
"Hi X129DPalexl, I am helping my aunties to apply ETA to visit us, but the ETA has not approved yet. Can you share with me the step you took to get it approve ?Regards,Whye"
"Hi Luigi,Thanks for your quick response.

Is this the step that you are referring ? Or do you mind to give me the link again ?Regards,Kwok Whye"
"Hi Luigi, Need some advise. If the ETA get granted, it can be use anytime right? I am flying in 2 days times and still didn’t hear anything back yet. I guess i learnt a hard lesson by only realizing last week that malaysian been under tight check on eta now due to those irresponsible malaysian overstaying in Australia. Reading all the post, im afraid I wont recive any reply anytime soon.. so i will just cancel my flight and hopefully can schedule another date."
Thanks for reply Luigi. Mine only say ETA cannot be granted as more information required. I then submitted all the documents to the etakl email for application. Still not hear anything yet.
I submitted on 13 Jan. Dont think i will hear anything back today for flight tomorrow.
"I need help on this please ,my sons visa got rejected and I’ve emailed to them and I’ve waited for 2 weeks and still no reply , getting worried cos our planned travelling date is from 13/3 - 24/3 . After submitting I realise perhaps I should have attach more information as what you mentioned which I didn’t send that much details but more to informations about me , my planned trip and my details .. son is just 24 and just finished studies and only plan to work for his father after our trip to Melbourne so there’s no company’s leave form or salary statement . Wonder whether I should forward another email and attached more informations or just wait for their reply ?"
"Hi Luigi , Tq for responding , yes he did that but sending it via my email since I prefer all emails comes to me with regards to their visa application. He has submitted it on 14/1 and up till now no response from the authority. What worries me the auto reply email we got says something like :Thank you for your email to the Temporary Visa section of the Department of Home Affairs at the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.Due to the number of enquiries and visa applications received by our office, we will not be able to respond to your email if your enquiry is answered by our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) If your application for an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) was lodged online or through a travel agent and you received advice that your application could not proceed, please refer to our website for further instructions you must follow in order for us to assist you. If you do not follow the instructions or use out of date forms, we will not be able to assist or respond to you:https:/…ETA.htmlI’m just worried I fall under the category of “if you do not follow the instructions we will not be able to assist or respond to you” if has been 2 weeks now , I’m planning to send additional information like my Australian friend contact as a guarantor since we will be travelling together to Hobart which I hope will help. How long normally will I get the response and do u think it’s enough time since our travelling period is from 13-23/3 ?"
"Truly understand his condition being young and unemployed, honestly he is doing his own online business and making good profit and he has submitted his bank statement and all our planned trip in fact we have all bought our flight tickets to and fro (we didn’t submit the flight info) , been to so many countries and never had such problem with visa and since we will be Leaving in March I thought we can still make it on time. It’s kinda sad to be going without him and such a waste of money .... 14/1-28/1 = 14 days and I’m praying for some good news . The problem is here in Malaysia the embassy does not accept walk in for interview in suspicious cases on visa application , everything is online and you are left wondering what’s happening !!! Really sad"
"I feel it’s not fair for genuine traveller like us , at least the embassy should accept walk in appointment for such cases and from there they can judge whether to grant visa or otherwise NOT by randomly pick the suspected target just because he qualifies or falls under the suspected group. Moreover we will be going as a family and he’s not alone ..... the looking forward holiday in Australia turns out to be the worse ever experience in terms or unfair judgment without given a chance to explains. Even in courts there’s plaintiffs n defenders n judge to listen. I guess if the system is right such as interviews , they won’t be that many overstaying culprits who’s just lucky to get a visa ! Sad"
"Hi I’ve submitted an ETA application (via email with documents required) on the 13th of Jan, there is still no reply.. any idea how long more I should wait or if there is any chance that I will get it? I’m flying on the 12th of February and it really is very stressful. I understand that it’s my fault for not submitting earlier."
"Thank you for your reply. Malaysian passport.I followed all the instructions on the gov website and submitted the requested documents to the email address provided. The automated email response said that the eta application has been received and they will get back to me when they have reached a decision. The email said apply at least one month before travel so I was wondering if they keep to their timings well. I’ve sent the email on 13th Jan, 2020."
I’m concerned because the forum says around 2 weeks but for me It’s already been 21 days and I haven’t got a reply.
"Sorry but I’m travelling on 12th of February, 2020. I really don’t know what to do anymore, I’m really stressed because I don’t know if I will get it in time. Do you know if they are back from holidays now? Or how many submissions do they generally receive and will it even be possible for me to make my trip? The email mentioned “applications should be done a month in advance” , and I did just that and I’m really praying that I will be able to make it. Again, thanks for your reply."
"I understand the circumstance that leads to the checks on the ETA visa application. I’m just asking if they usually will keep to their stated time frame, or will it take longer than a month for me to receive a reply. Thanks again."
"yea because it’s well past the time frame (it’s been 21 days since I sent the email until now) and I still haven’t received a reply which is why I’m really worried.Could they have missed out my email? Thanks again for your reply. Sorry if I sound rude, I’m just really stressed about this."
"You are not alone Jolene. My husband’s ETA application was not granted as further information required. He sent supporting documents on January 10, 2020 (Friday). Received auto reply on January 13, 2020 (Monday) but still no decision until now."
May I know when is your trip? My flight is supposed to be next Wednesday and that’s why I’m really really stressed about it.We’ve paid a lot for the flight tickets and I really can’t afford to miss this trip. And the airline does not allow refunds / rescheduling without a very big price tag.
"Our flight will be on February 28, 2020. We are waiting anxiously. I thought our appeal were missed out or something but it seems like appeals sent during that period got delayed. If u don’t mind pls update here if u got your results"
"Thanks, seems like you still have some time. I’m not sure if I will be able to make the flight but I’m also really really praying that I will be able to get the email. Alright, let me know if you hear from them as well."
"I'm also waiting for my ETA decision where further information was sent on 14 January 2020. Just to share I remember reading on another tripadvisor thread that you could also try to apply for the subclass 600 visitor visa on the Aus Immi website, which costs AUD145 but potentially has a faster response time. There are more documents required there and some people hear back within 3 days. Worth a shot if you cannot delay your trip."
"I will share my experience with ETA. My husband and I submitted applications for ETA at the end of November. My husband got ETA about 3 hours after application in the meantime I was asked to submit addition information. After submission maybe 1 week later my application was refused. Then I searched all the information I could find and found out one post in tripadvisor saying that in case if you are from risk countries, you should submit all the documents even before they asked you. That's what I did. Few days later I submitted application for ETA again and immediately submitted documents which prove that I am not gonna stay in Australia and I have enough money: bank accounts extracts (my husbands' and mine), working contract, journey plan, declaration of my husband that he can support me (even I had enough money). And after 2 days I got my ETA. :)"
"I’ve sent email too on 14 Jan 2020 and up todate still no news , read a lot of write ups from other travellers stating the reason why it was rejected , the obvious reasons was 1) new passport 2) Not working .. my son falls under that and I feel it’s a slim chance for him getting the visa with the document I sent . My son just graduated last year and will be joining his father in our family business so I’m not going to wait for that 1 month only knowing it will be rejected. So now we proceeded with applying the subclass 600 , appt was this morning, submitted all documents, his bank statement with substantial amount , his ASB ,car registration ownership, his old passport pages with places he went to , Sponsor letter from me and my husband and even an invitation letter from our Australian friend we will be visiting. Submit it via VFS global and yeah we have bought all flight tickets and accomodation thinking we still have time for visa, been to many other countries but this is the first time we encounter with such problem. Now we just have to cross our fingers and hope for the best ... I’ve heard some cases even when you are granted visa chances of you being held back n deported will still be there .... I was like .. u must be kidding me ??!!! Is it true ??!!"
"Of course it’s true that you can still be denied entry when you hold a visa. That’s not specific to Australia but any country. If immigration agents believe that the reason for the visit is not tourism then they can cancel your visa. They don’t so that on a whim. There has to be a reason or evidence to make them suspect the person is intending to stay or work in Australia. If you’re genuine tourists with clear travel,plans and sufficient funds for your visit, they’re not going to deport you atbthe border."
Sure. Will do. Hope we all get replies soon
"Good luck Rosezul, I will most likely apply for 600 if I don't hear back soon. I was planning to do it online myself. Perhaps I can consider VFS too. Hope it all works out and keep us posted!"
"Hey Luigi, when you mentioned “compelling reasons to prove that he will come back to Malaysia”, does being a student at a local university count? I’ve included my offer letter stating my studies end in 2023 and also my uni results (to prove that I’m a genuine student)."
"Sorry what do you mean by carry some weight ? My English isn’t that good. And yes, i mentioned that I will be starting my 2nd year in March 2020."
"Can we apply for 2 different visas simultaneously? Let's say a person applies for an ETA visa first and while waiting for the appeal result, he applies for a subclass 600 visa. What will happen to the first application? Will it be cancelled? Are there any chances that one person gets 2 different visas at the same time? Just curious about how the visa system works."
"In the separate thread I read, someone applied for 600 after giving up on waiting for ETA appeal and received both approvals on the same day (coincidentally). The applicant was asked to withdraw one visa in the end. Personally, I think this should only be done when there's no other choice, the poor department already has a lot of work."
Have you got your reply yet? i have sent my documents on January 13 but still no reply until today. must be due to my newly renewed passport :(
"Hey. No I haven’t got any reply. Even if they rejected they should at least let us know. I’ve sent the email on 13th Jan as well. My flight is next week, will probably be unable to fly by then."

"But you have already applied and sent the document 1 month before your flight date, you should have received by then. Hope you able to get it before your flight, finger crossed. I also have applied and submitted the document on 13th January, we are on the same boat. Will keep this post updated if I receive any update/know any other way."
"Hi,So I have sent all the required informations to etakl on Jan 9. Its Feb 7 today (almost a month) and still no reply... I sent them a reminder email a few days ago, but other than the usual auto reply email.. still nothing from them. I know all i can do is wait, but i'm getting anxious day by day. Is it normal to take this long?"
"My sister ETA also got rejected on 4th Feb, she submitted further documents required on 5th Feb, her flight on 19th Feb. We still have no idea whether should change her flight date? Seems like more and more genuine Malaysian tourist facing this problem.Edited: 4:02 am, February 07, 2020 "
"Hi Luigi, do you know anyone that have received their eta after a month? (Those who have applied within January). Because everyone on this thread seems to haven’t received anything"
Hi again. Will it help if my husband email the immi supplementary documents such as our travel plans and flight tickets to other destinations that we already planned for this year. Will it give some weight to my husband’s application? Since it will show that he already has other travel commitments and it wouldn’t be possible for him to overstay in Australia. Is it ok to send multiple emails? Will it affect the first email the he sent?
"Hi all, I would like to describe my situation for the past half month that I apply for Australia Visa.I have applied the VISA but getting rejected from both agent and official website.I have sent the required info to the specific email address that mentioned in here: https:/…MoreInfoI have apply multiple application (more than 3), which only consist of 1 email per timeframe, and still not able to get processed, reason is my email message getting blocked or didn't include some specific document.Here is roughly my email content:1. I am currently using Gmail.2. I have download the email into my PC (extension .eml), it is not exceed 5MB.3. I have answered all the needed information based on above information page, and also include 8 files with all PDF format without ZIP them.4. I have make the email as simple as possible with no table structure in the content.My trip is schedule on end of April cross May this year.I wish someone correct me if I miss out anything that caused the email server blocked my message.I am also seeking advice on how to send a more proper email, any templates might help.Thank you for your help in advance."
"Hi Luigi, thank you for your prompt response.I used the Australian government ETA application website that you have provided to apply VISA, and they are asking for more information.I have tested to send to other people and they are able to receive the email with accessible attachment. I am not sure why the Australia Comission have issues when they receive my email and the attachments, either it is blocked, incorrect attachment format, asking rescan documents, or not receive the email.I have done the application multiple times as spoken, and get reviewed by others before I send, it seems like ok, so I wonder if anything I should avoid when submit new application?I am planning to visit Australia with my family members, and I never been Australia."
"Hey jounouchi, have you sent any email to etakl@dfat attaching all the required documents? And have you received a reply? (Other than the automated “we have received your application” reply from the bot)I’ve applied on 13th Jan, supposed to apply “at least a month before travel”, I did exactly that, but have not received any reply from them"
"Hi Jolene, yes, I have send the required documents (all PDF attachments) which mentioned in the website, never get any auto reply saying application received and processed for the last application.The only auto reply is I send an follow up email after two weeks, then they auto reply me.May I know if you receive auto reply from your end?If yes, can you please inbox me and share your templates? And also what kind of attachment did you include if possible.Thank you."
"Hi, Is anyone getting the ETA approval recently and can help to provide the date of sending the email application for more information ? @Luigi, Is there a number in Australia that I can call to follow up ?Regards,Kwok Whye"
"Hi Whye, can you please check inbox? Have some questions to ask you, thanks for helping."
Just to share: I called the VFS Malaysian number provided by Luigi (thanks Luigi) and was advised that the ETA further information applications will take a month to process now. They weren't able to explain why applications from 9/10 January are not yet responded to. As I sent mine on 14 January they told me to wait.
"omg really? I sent mine on 9 Jan, still haven't received a reply from them. Should I call them? >.<"
Derek I think you should try. Maybe your answer will be different since already more than a month.
When did u call them herngene? My husband tried to call them using the international number that Luigi provided and also local number stated in the VFS website but nobody answered both lines. Somebody told my husband that today is Australia's public holiday. Is it true?
Hi Junaina I called them this morning around 11am KL time. It was a voice automated answering machine for most parts and you have to select to speak to a human. My guess is they have insufficient manpower to answer the phone when your husband called.
"I applied on 24th December 2019 for ETA visa and cannot be approved as required more documents. Send the additional documents on 31st December 2019 and received acknowledgement auto-reply from them on 2nd January 2020. Since then, never heard any news from them regarding my application even thought more than a month already."
"oh my god, you applied on 31 dec also like that not even have to say about all of us submitted on January. does any one try to reapply on ETA and got different result ?"
Diyana can you try calling either the Malaysian VFS number + 6 03 2166 6550 or the Australian one Global Service Centre on +61 2 6196 0196 sent by Luigi?I am curious to know what they will say since your email has been so long.Whye I haven't tried reapplying but I am tempted...
"Meanwhile, I am trying to send application but it seems keep getting rejected by the email server as no auto acknowledgement email.May I know how long will it take for the automated email received after send the application?"
My fiance and I had recently applied ETA online. My fiance gotten the green light while mine had been rejected. I've sent all necessary documents and still awaiting for their reply. I've been to Australia twice for a holiday and both of the trip my visa got approved. This will be my 3rd time visiting but visa got rejected :'( Will update once I've received a reply from them.
Vfs refuses to help. I’ve tried calling and expressing my urgency but all they say is “it’s under the embassy and there’s nothing we can do” and they just ask me to wait wait wait so yea.
"Vin, when do you send all the documents ?"
I also called VFS and they told me the same thing too. Nothing they can do from their side.
"Same thing for me, i also emailed VFS but this is what they said:""Please note that Australian visa applications are processed by delegated officers of the Department of Home Affairs. VFS staffs do not provide immigration/documentation advice and do not process or decide visa applications.""Is there nothing we could do other than wait? I've been waiting patiently for the 14 working days, then 1 month, but now is just aimlessly waiting..."
"As of now, I can only think of 2 possible idea as following.- try to call their support center(+61 2 6196 0196 ) to ask about the status -> I tried to call this and managed to talk to them but because I am applying for my aunty. They refused to give me an update. - try apply ETA via the eta website again and see your luck. Not sure whether it will have the same status."
Hey whye may I ask the number that you are referring to is which support centre?
+61 is the area code for Australia2 is the area code for Sydney
it is global service centre. You need to call in australia office hour.
5th Feb. Only email I've gotten at the moment is an automated reply. Hopefully I'll get an answer by next week or so.
"Hi Luigi, I have a question. I have a current valid visa until 11th June. I'll be travelling to Australia in 17th June and my visa will already have expired. Is it okay if I apply for a new visa while my current visa is still valid? I've already applied for a new visa and it got rejected. So not sure if it's because of the current valid visa that I'm already holding."
No it’s not because of that Vin. I’ve always had a current visa when I apply for a new one. The new one cancels out the existing one.Mine have always been granted (not a Malaysian passport holder though). I don’t know if a rejected application also cancels a current one.
"Hi Luigi, only traveled there twice at the moment. First trip was with my family in 2016 and another one last year for a company trip. I would like to travel there this year with my fiance :("
"Thanks Luigi for your reply. Understood on that. I've already sent my additional docs to etakl@dfat.gov.au. If I do not hear from them, will I be able to try out on applying the subclass 600 visa? As I've heard there is a higher chance of getting a visa by attaching the necessary docs as well."
"I’ve tried calling +61261960196, the Australian home affairs global number, and they can’t help either. Because the eta is all handled by the Australian embassy in Malaysia. I’ve applied for the ETA a month before my flight, just like what they suggested on their website, one month waiting time. But in the end, I’m going to waste my flight ticket anyway. I understand the Malaysian overstaying problem but please try to understand that there are some of us who are genuine travellers too, and it would be nice if we could get fair treatment. Or at least keep to your own stated waiting times. But yea. Good luck to everyone else."
"I’ve called the Australian home affairs global number (+61261960196) and they can’t help either. Because eta are handled by local Australian embassies only. I’ve applied for the eta one month before my flight, (just like the advertised waiting time on their website) and in the end I’m still going to waste the money spent because I’m unable to get a visa. I understand the Malaysians overstaying problem but please understand that there are genuine travellers too and we deserve fair treatment. Or at least keep to the processing timings that you published. Good luck to everyone else."
"I’ve applied for the eta a month before my flight. (As advertised on the official Australia website), and I have not received any reply. It’s been a month. And I’m going to end up wasting the money spent on the ticket. I understand the Malaysians overstaying problem but you also have to understand that there are genuine travellers like us too. We deserve fair treatment, or at least keep to your own publicised processing time. Good luck to everyone else"
"Hello Everyone,I feel so sorry for those who are under pressure of getting ETA approved. It happened to me as well. I helped my mother, father and sister to apply for an ETA, only my sister ETA not approved. So I applied for 600 visa and lets see what happens next. I live in Melbourne for 10 years and even though I sponsor my family to come and visit me, I think in the end I will still get a NO from them. It is sad. Genuine travellers are not given ETA to travel Australia. Maybe we should go to NZ instead."
"I feel for you, James. That's why I advice people to get their ETA approved first before they buy ticket. Genuine travelers are not given ETA, how ridiculous."
"Hello, any news about your appeal? I think your flight is today right?"
it’s so unfair. They won’t respond to emails nor accept calls requesting status updates when they are the one who’s not adhering to their own processing times. And it’s people like us who need to suffer because of their incompetence.
"it’s people like us who will suffer because of their incompetence. we have no intention to overstay, yet they discriminate us without even giving us a chance."
"it’s unfair and it’s ridiculous. I understand the required checks by the government, I really do. But after we followed instructions and supplied all the documents, what’s their excuse for not adhering to their processing times? Their website clearly stated processing time is one month before intended flight, that’s what I did. But they refuse to give me an answer even till now."
"I understand the required checks by the government, I really do. But after we followed all instructions and submitted all the documents , what’s their excuse for not adhering to their own stated processing times?"
"Hi singsoon, are you asking me? Yes my flight is today and no I have not received any response even after sending reminder emails. At this point it’s already 32 days after I sent my eta application email. I’m going to miss my flight"
So what you’re suggesting to solve the overstaying problem is by denying access for other Malaysians into your country?? By not even allowing any of us to appeal and not responding to eta applications? Even after we have followed the instructions and waited the length of your processing time? How absurd.
"Hey Luigi, would you suggest the ones that have not heard back from their eta application to apply for subclass 600 visa? At this point I don't know if waiting is wiser or waiting precious time.Also, just on top of my head. I know that malaysian overstayers is a serious problem, but why don't they issue an interview for all visa applicant. (like applying for USA visa) The officer can ask and judge the person better than through an email."
Maybe try Visa 600? It is a bit expensive but at least you will get an answer within 20 days.
"Hi JustJames, when do you submit your email application and when is your flight ? do you try to apply ETA online again and see whether you will have different status ?"
"Hello Whye,No point to reapply for ETA because computer system has your ETA rejected in the past."
I just applied the subclass 600 visitor visa. Hope my extra RM400 can get a respond from them this time..
"Hi Derek,My sister got rejected on Friday last week. I did not submit more documents to appeal. Straight away I applied for 600. It is $145 and will be processed within 20 days but still no guarantee. The website allows you to upload all the documents you want to share with them. My sister's flight is on 26/05/2020. We will have a bit of time to change our travel plans and throw away the tickets we bought. If I get rejected again, then I will have to give up the tickets to Australia and buy a brand new ticket to New Zealand instead. I think its time to think about travel to other countries like New Zealand or Europe. I live in Melbourne for 10 years and if I cannot sponsor my own sister for a few days holidays here, then I will have nothing else to say about this country."
"Hi Singsoon, Do update us once your sister have gotten the green light!"
"hi singsoon2007,it seems for your sister that she still got time to work things out. My flight is on 26 Feb, I sent my docs on 9 Jan...but now i'm feeling like those who did things on last minute.. Maybe i should have just straight out apply for 600 visa. This ETA stuff has been sucking my time and energy.."
"Hello Vin, I don't expect anything from them. I am Australia Citizen and I don't expect anything. For sure I will update you guys."
"Hello Luigi, The plan was: My parents and my sister come to Sydney for a night on 27/05/2020. Then we fly to Christchurch on 28//05/2020 for a week holiday. After that we fly from Queenstown to Melbourne on 04/06/2020 for two nights. They will stay with me in Melbourne before next flight to KL on 06/06/2020.Basically they only need ETA for three nights instead of 12 months. Air tickets, hotels, car were booked 12 months ago. I have submitted a statutory declaration together with my passport copy and citizenship certificate, my employment letter in Melbourne, my sister bank statement. New plan (B) if rejected again: Buy a brand new ticket for my sister to fly direct from KL to Christchurch to meet me and my parents. At this stage, I pretty sure I will be going for plan B because there are so many people get rejected with their ETA application. My friends said to me there is hope but I don't think so."
"Hi Derek, Do you try to call GFS ?"
"Hello Derek, Yes, you are right that I still have a bit of time to get things organised but I don't think it is going to work. Your flight is the end of this month. Maybe you need to go Visa 600. I just give up and I rather to travel to other countries now."
"Dear Luigi,The question here is:1. We will have one night in Sydney 27/05/2020 and fly to Christchurch on 28/05/2020. For transit visa, it means we have to stay in the transit area in the airport for the whole night and cannot go out of the airport at all right? 2. When we fly back from Queenstown to Melbourne on 04/06/2020, my family will have two nights in Melbourne. So how transit visa going to work for them? Do you mind to elaborate a bit please."
"Hello Ruigi,I think my last choice will be a transit visa for 72 hours. 27/05/2020 at 1030AM arrive Sydney 28/05/2020 at 0730AM leave Sydney to NZ. (Less than 24 hours)04/06/2020 at 0530PM arrive Melbourne 06/06/2020 at 1050PM leave Melbourne (Less than 72 hours)My question is:1. Do I apply for transit visa twice? one for Sydney? And another one for Melbourne? Please advise. Thank you so much in advance."
"Hi everyone, sharing my experience here with my ETA application. Just got it granted today, flying off tomorrow. 6th Jan - applied for ETA online and got rejected8th Jan - submitted additional information to etakl for appeal, received automated reply5th Feb - sent a reminder email to etakl requesting for decision letter, received automated reply6th Feb - sent another reminder email, with additional documents to prove we have further commitments in Malaysia, received automated reply 10th Feb - called VFS, they said since it’s more than a month, they will send a reminder email to the embassy for us.11th Feb - called VFS asking for an update, they said there’s nothing they can do on their end. They will call us when they receive a reply from Australia embassy 12th Feb - called Australia’s Global Service centre, they weren’t helpful. Sent another email to etakl requesting for decision letter, did not receive an automated reply as per usual. However, 2 hours later, received an email requesting for details of family members in Malaysia. Replied to the email just before 4pm, got my ETA granted just after 5pm. When I called Australia Global Service, they claimed that the one month period claimed on the auto replied email is just a guide, there’s no exact duration given by them, unlike the Class 600 visa, where there is a statistic on their website. I told them it wasn’t fair for us, as it was mentioned on their automated reply to apply “at least a month before travel date”, but do not provide us with a reply after a month and we do not have sufficient time to apply for Class 600 visa. The lady just kept saying that the “one month” duration is just a guide, there’s no exact duration for it to process. Suggest to those people waiting for their ETA, unless you have ample time to waste with the Australian Department, it is probably a better idea to apply for the Class 600 visa. I understand the need for the Australian government to be stricter at young, single male and female at granting them visa, but I don’t think it’s fair for us, genuine visitors, to have this much trouble with the whole process. The least you could do is provide a duration and stick to it."
"Hi Babyeeyore, Can you show us your drafted message from your last email to etakl? Btw, have a safe trip! Good for you."
"Hey. I have managed to reschedule my flight to April. Since I am still waiting for them to respond to my ETA application, should I sent my newly flight confirmation tickets to them? But I don’t want to risk sending too many emails... btw I’ve previously sent my flight details (the one that I missed) in my application email."
"Hey Babyeeyore,On this part, how do you get VFS to send the email for you ? are you their customer?10th Feb - called VFS, they said since it’s more than a month, they will send a reminder email to the embassy for us."
"Hi Vin,Thanks for the well wishes! The email was as usual, stating that I am waiting for the decision letter, and asking if there are anything I can do/documents I can provide to hasten the process. I also express the purpose of the trip, which is to attend a close friend’s wedding, which will be held this weekend. Hope it helps."
"Hi Whye,No, I am not a customer of VFS. I have called them a few times prior to the one month period, and they said since it’s written on the email that it takes a month, they told me to wait. I called them again and said it’s been more than a month but I have yet to receive a reply for them, that’s when they said they will help investigate by sending an email over to the Australia Embassy. I did not receive a reply from them since then."
"Hey Diyana, thanks for sharing the good news. This gives us some hope.Hopefully we will get too.Hey Babyeeyore, thanks for reply too. You stated that you receive the approval on after 5pm. Is that malaysia time 5pm ?"
Thank you to Babyeeyore and Diyana for update. Glad it worked out and appreciate the detailed timeline shared here. I applied for 600 visa as well so hope I get one of my applications approved. Sharing positive vibes with everyone.
Hello HerngeneWhere is your flight?
"Luigi - Apparently yes. Just to share will all, the processing time really takes up to 1 month or more, in which my case is more. Maybe because of the peak season."
"hi guys I am a malasyian passport holder.been stalking this topic for close to 3weeks now. likewise i bought 2 tickets for wife and myself back in march 2019. since i have been and stayed around australia for many times in the past having family there. it has never crossed my mind that i would be rejected by online ETA submission but my wife was approved instanttly. so on 21st Jan i started the long process of doc submission and send about 7reminders about the status of which all replied with auto mailers , but yesterday received an official acknowledgement letter from Home Affairs Dept. it just said they have received my docs on 21st Jan and looking into my application. how long more do i got to wait from this juncture? its really nerve wrecking. count down timer to my flight is exactly 14days. i am also thinking of skipping stepping into australia however my tickets are with 2 carriers scoot and jetstar and last i checked they are not on flight code share so the airport system would check my bags till sydney and i got to check through immigration to get my backs and recheck in again to fly out of sydney to auckland. for this i definately need a Transit VISA. my advise to anyone who wants to visit australia . get your ETA / tourist VISA approved first before travel period.Edited: 5:33 am, February 13, 2020 "
"Hi jwcw,From what I know, most of them here gotten their reply after a month plus. It's no longer the usual 2 weeks (in most cases) anymore. If you applied in 21st January, I assumed you will then get a reply after 21st February or so. Are you still able to change the dates of your flight? Hoping you're able to get your Visa approved soon."
"Hi Sing Soon,My flight is Mid March, so i am also cutting it close especially if the 600 takes one month. It's good that this forum is now more active with sharings, we have ideas on how to follow up and alternative plans we can take.Since you have done the 600, I think you should be OK, and you have much more time."
"Hello jwcw,I totally agree with you. We must get our visa approved before we book air ticket and hotels. Mine situation is the same. My family will fly from KL to Sydney with AA on 27/05/2020, one night in Sydney. We will fly out Sydney with EK to Christchurch on 28/05/2020 for a week. Then we fly from Queenstown to Melbourne with NZ on 04/06/2020 for two nights. On 06/06/2020 they will fly back to KL with AA. I have applied for Subclass 600 and will wait for the outcome. If it is rejected again, then I will go for a transit visa. Let's see what is going to happen but I don't have any expectation. Worst case scenario is to buy a brand new ticket fly from KL/Changi to Christchurch. Good luck to all of us."
"Hello Herngene,My flight is on 26/05/2020 evening. I still have a bit of time. Worst case scenario is to spend more money to buy a new ticket."
"Thanks for the sharing everyone.Same case happened, applied my ETA through travel agent on 3rd January but get rejected. On 15th Jan, appealed by submitted all the additional documents to etakl and till now I didn't get any reply from them. Moreover, it is being highlighted that ""Please do not approach the High Commission in person""...I think what I can do now is to wait and wait. Nothing else."
"So I called VFS again, on friday. The lady I spoke to said she'll contact the embassy about my situation. Today I received my ETA respond...I got rejected.. I have mixed feelings right now, idk whether they reply to me is really because after VFS reminded them or just coincidence. However, it took them 40 days to tell me 'no'. I feel like I've wasted a lot of time here..I have also applied for subclass 600 tourist visa last Wednesday(when i gave up waiting), is there a way I can further strengthen this application? i dont even know if i can make it in time...really hopeless now...Edited: 12:59 am, February 17, 2020 "
"Hi Derek, Do they give any reason of rejection ? I was about to call VFS to help, but now I am not sure whether I should call. Regards,Kwok Whye"
"Luigi, well its not much of a choice for me rn. The trip is planned by my cousin in Australia, i'm going with a few of his friends. I've paid flight tickets and accommodations for Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. My return flight is a business class Singapore Airline...So yea, its a huge lost for me if i cant make it.."
"Hi Derek, What info did you provide them? Was the info given sufficient? What was the reason of the rejection? I am curious as well."
"Hello Derek, I feel for you. Regards."
"Hello Derek, How many days in Australia? I am waiting for outcome for 600 too."
"Good day to all,I have some good news to share. I applied for 600 after giving up on waiting for ETA further information appeal (sent 14 January 2020). I applied for 600 on 10 February, I got the approval today, 18 February 2020, for multiple entries, 3 months.I applied through the online Immi Account. I did not do any follow up, except that last night I attached further documents (final wedding invite) to show my friend's wedding dates.What I think helped in my case - a provided a lot of documents and a cover letter to explain my intention to visit (with reference to the supporting documents). When you upload attachments to Immi online, no matter what order you upload them they will re-arrange by file name alphabetical order. So the OCD tip (for people who want to be super organised) is to label your files with numbers or alphabetically . Anyway, my attached files were all over the place but I believe the file names and cover letter helped the officers with their review.I hope this helps for those of you wanting to consider 600. When I have time, I will write a feedback to Aus Immi about the ETA processing time, more people need to know that the processing time is now delayed and is uncertain."
"Hello Herngene, I am so happy for you. Pack you luggage and ready to go. Yay. I am still waiting for mine to get through. Let’s see. I think invitation letter is important. I thought 600 is for 12 months multi entries? Anyway, so happy for you. Have a lovely trip."
"Thanks for your well wishes. You guys are right, I read wrongly, my 600 is a one year visa, and i can come in for 3 months every time (multiple) within the one year.I hope everyone else has good news. One other thing I remember adding in my application for 600 is that I have a letter from my office confirming my work with them and confirming that they are aware that I will be in Aus from X to Y and that I will return to work on Z. So that could help towards proving intention to return to Malaysia. I also wrote that my family and boyfriend are here, my work and residence is here (basically my life is here) so I have no intention to stay in Aus beyond the stated period. Good luck to the rest of the applicants."
"Thanks for sharing all the good news. I wish will get some good news too but only leave 3 day to go before the flight. Too bad that even I submitted on 16 Jan, but still no news now."
"Hi herngene. Congrats on the good news! My husband did exactly as u mentioned. From providing employment details, financial statements, intention for visit, and even organizing the documents by number and creating a list for easier reference. The only thing my husband didn't do was applying for the subclass 600 visa. He called vfs a few times but they told him to wait. Sent emails requesting for status updates to etakl but only received auto replies. Documents were submitted on 10/01/2020 and it has been more than 30 days but still no reply from them. I guess they prioritize the subclass 600 visa more compared to the ETA visa."
"Hi sjl224, Don't worry, your husband is not alone. I am at the same path as your husb except mine was sent to them on 5th February. As of today, I've only sent one extra email regarding a status update and expanded my justification. I am giving it another month for the reply or else I will proceed to apply the subclass 600 instead. Do update us once your husband have gotten a reply!Edited: 4:04 am, February 18, 2020 "
"Hi sji224,When is your husband flight ?"
"Hi Vin, My sister also sent in on 5th Feb, seem at least take a month or more for them to reply their decision."
"Whye, our flight is on 28/02. I really hope we'll get the answer by this week and hopefully it's a positive one. Gosh. I didn't expect it would take this long. I guess it would be too late now to apply for the subclass 600 visa.Vin, will surely update here. I know how it feels.Edited: 4:27 am, February 18, 2020 "
"Hi Alex Grace, We can update each other here. Yeah usually will take a month plus plus. My email tab is always up waiting for their decision email."
"Hi sji224,Yes, I think it is too late to go for Visa 600. Hopefully you get it granted before departure."
"Hello Vin, If you have enough time, perhaps try Visa 600?"
"Hi Singsoon, Yes I have enough time to try the Visa 600 but still have time to wait for the ETA as well. I'm travelling around mid year but I just want to get this visa over and done with so that I can continue planning my itinerary. Hope to hear from your Visa 600 application."
"Hi, Is there anyone submitted the email application after 10 Jan and receive approval ? So far from this forum, we see people submitted on 8 and 9 Jan receive a response but no one after 10 Jan one has received any response."
"The statistics seem to show that you get a reply to the appeal around 38-40 calendar days after submitting further appeal and with follow up (through VFS and calling Aus). So by that measure, those submitting after 10 Jan should get a response by next week. If I hadn't gotten the 600 my original plan was to call and follow up frequently for the ETA response.Edited: 10:29 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"Dear Sjl224, I hope your husband succeeds to get the ETA appeal. Hope his follow up is successful."
"Hi Leon,The 600 can be applied via Malaysia agent VFS (with interview appointment) or online by registering with the online Immi Account. I did mine online. The official processing time is up to a month so you can count backwards and use that as a guide to decide when to start your Immi application."
"Hello Leon T,Subclass 600 is very easy to do it online because you can upload as many documents as you like up to 60 documents if I am not wrong. Once you have decided to go for 600, you need to get ready all the relevant documents, otherwise no point to go for 600. It is very expensive $145 (RM410) for a tourist visa. You can actually fly to Taipei and back to Kuala Lumpur with that money. So my advice is: please get ready all the documents before you apply for it. The more documents the better. Good thing is visa 600 processing time is up to one month. So at least you get an outcome in one months time. But still there is no guarantee you will get the visa even if you apply for 600. I wish you good luck."
Any one receive approval this few days ?
"Hi Whye, Nope, have not gotten any decision letter yet."
"Hi,Just want to update you guys here.I got my 600 visitor visa GRANTED today.I applied on 12 Feb, got it 20 Feb (today.)I have went through a hella emotional roller coaster this past week. So glad I made it in the end. Wish the rest of you good luck!To conclude, if you have time (2 months+) you may go ahead with appealing for ETA. If you dont have much time, I would really suggest you to just pay the extra RM400 and get that 600 visitor visa. They process faster and higher chances of approval."
"Hi, just want to update here.I’ve sent documents on 13th Jan, and today (20th feb) I have received my approved ETA.I’ve missed my flight which was scheduled on 12th Feb, but have since then managed to postpone my trip to April :)"
"Thanks for your update jolene,I submitted on 16 Jan but my aunty flight is tomorrow. I guess most likely will miss the flight too :( . Now I really regret didn't go for visa 600 previously. For those that you have less than 2 month before your travel date, it is better to go for visa 600 instead.Edited: 5:54 am, February 20, 2020 "
Good for you guys Jolene and Derek! Hope you guys have a safe trip!
Thank you for the well wishes everyone! I sincerely hope you all will receive an approved ETA soon as well
Hi everyone. Just wanna share that my husband's ETA application has been granted this morning. I hope that everyone here gets the result soon.
Wow congrats all!!! Enjoy your trips :)
Wow. Everyone is getting it APPROVED
"Hi all,Is there anyone of you that appealed or submitted the supporting document after 15th January 2020 but yet to receive any feedback or reply from them?"
"Hi, I submitted mine on 13 Jan and got approved last Friday. Hope you receive it around this few days."
"Hi Leon, it's good to hear that. Hope will get their reply by this week. :)"
"Dear all, Just letting you know my sister's subclass 600 was granted today at 12PM Malaysia time. I am so happy. I did not appeal for her ETA rejection. If you guys do not have enough time to appeal for ETA, please consider Subclass 600. Application was submitted on 11/02/2020 straight after ETA rejection. I just want to share with all of you what documents I have submitted to support my sister's application. Most important point here, my sister is NOT employed at all. 1. Airlines tickets (Must be return ticket not one way)2. Hotel bookings (Agoda or Booking.com)3. Car rental invoice 4. Statutory declaration from the person who is in Australia5. Cover letter to explain when, how, why this trip was organise6. Birth certificates to prove the relationship7. Trip itinerary to show all the daily activities that you will be doing in overseas8. A copy of old passport and new passport9. Passport and citizenship certificate copy to prove that my sister has close relative in Australia. 10. Travel history (photos of applicant in Australia in the past)11. Bank statement to show how much saving applicant has to cover for the expenses in Australia. 12. Invitation letter from relatives from Australia is important. I wish all of you good luck with your ETA/600 application. See ya."
Thanks for sharing your experience. Good luck enjoy.
"So happy for you SingSoon , Leon and everyone who got their approvals!As a post credit note, Aus Department of Home Affairs sent me a request for further information today, around 40- 41 days after my original ETA further appeal sent on 14 Jan 2020. They wanted me to complete a travel declaration that I have not been to China recently. Since I have gotten my 600, i will withdraw my ETA application . This is the first communication I have received from the authorities since 14 Jan."
"Hi Luigi,We will be heading to Sydney for company trip this 17-23 March. I made a mistake of assuming that we would not have an issue with getting the visas till 2 out of 8 of my staff have their ETA applications rejected. The reason provided was ""Your ETA cannot be processed. To be considered for an ETA you need to email more information to Australia’s Department of Home Affairs."" I am guessing both of them are mistakenly profiled as potential overstayers. And I am not sure if it would have made any difference but our ETA applications were submitted by the travel agent as individuals instead of group.Anyway, all the travel agent could advise was to follow the appeal procedure as stated here https:/…MoreInfoMy staff have submitted all their documents on the 7th Feb (appeal) to the email address (as stated on that web page) but have not heard back till now. They've received the automated acknowledgement mail but no news on their appeal results. Is there anything that we can do to get response soon considering that we are running out of time?Additionally, as an employer, are there any other documents that I can provide to prove their intent of return? So far, I've issued them letter of employment/declaration as well as salary statement. Thank you."
"Noted and thank you for the advice, Luigi"
"Hi everyone,Hope all is well. Anyone of you that submitted the supporting document after 5th Feb 2020 receive any feedback or reply yet?Thanks!"
"Hi Vin,I submitted on 15th Jan but till now there is no reply from them. Anyone have any idea how to follow up? As I apply through travel agent but there is no reference number given and they told me that nth that they can do and ask me to wait for the reply. The time frame given is more than it suppose to be. Is there anyone can help?"
"Hi Max, Oh no that's bad. Those sent on the 13th Jan had already received the reply. I will be applying for the subclass 600 by 16th this month if there is no reply."
"Exactly. It's been enough time for them to process but yet until today there is no respond from them. In my case, I have not commit any of the expenses yet while I try to get my ETA before anything else. But its been almost 45 days since I submitted. You should apply for subclass 600 instead as their processing time nowadays is longer and unpredictable."
No feedback/reply till now. Supporting documents were submitted on 7th Feb.
"Morning everyone. Just sharing with you, A friend of mine who lives in Bintulu (38 years old) applied for an ETA and got rejected yesterday afternoon. Luckily he has not bought air ticket in advance. His passport expiry is 2023. He has been to over 15 countries since 2018 like Europe, America, UK and Asia. I think it doesn’t matter where have you been in the past, you might still get a rejection. Personally I think they are targeting the age rather than anything else. Have a lovely day."
"Hi Everyone,Just a quick update on my sister's Visa. She got her Sub 600 visitor visa GRANTED today at 6.45am Malaysia time. Her ETA rejected on 4th Feb, Submitted supporting document on 5th Feb. She decided to try Subclass 600 on 20th Feb since ETA appeal have to wait more than a month. Just about 12 days she has received Sub 600 Granted notice. Good Luck Everyone!Edited: 10:41 pm, March 02, 2020 "
Thanks Luigi :)
"1 of 2 of my staff got her subclass 600 visa granted today, 5 March. Both applied on the 28th Feb. Hopefully, we will get a reply for the other staff soon.And no reply on their ETA appeal since 7 Feb 2020."
"Hi FarAway,Good to hear that. Seems like everyone is getting their subclass 600 granted but not an eta reply. Hmm. I guess we have to pay alot more for a quicker response."
"Hello Luigi, I agree with you. I believe they are swamped with appeals and additional documents. Everyday many people get rejected with ETA application. Visa 600 is a better option but it is expensive. No one willing to pay for that amount of money unless it is really urgent. For Malaysians, RM420 is a lot of money for a tourist visa. I have a feeling in the end ETA will be replaced by sub class 600. Regards."
"Thanks, Vin! -----Personally speaking, I have no issues with providing the supporting documents as long as we are given a chance to do so. I think it is a fair request to prevent overstayers.I am somewhat regretting my decision to assign a third party (travel agent) to handle the visa applications. They probably didn't do much to prove that we are genuine tourists + getting all this sorted out close to the departure date. Lesson learned :)"
"I submitted my online application (subclass 600) on 11th February but until now received no response. I saw that most of the people here who applied for the same visa got feedback within two weeks. I wonder what's wrong with my application. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to connect with the AU embassy in KL."
"AshiHave you check your account, sometimes they miss sending a confirmation it has be granted.As general rule the Embassies for Australia are not part of with Visa Issues.This is not really the purpose they are there for. People with certain passports have their application more closely investigated. Good Luck"
"I’ve submitted my Subclass 600 on 27 Feb. Still no reply. I’m flying 14 March, 4 days away. What kind of documentation did u submit by the way? Thanks"
"Post #276, I think you are ""Hoping to Fly on 14 March""I suggest check your immigration account, the Department will advise what they require to each case.Good Luck"
Tq Dee for the reply. But Ive applied through Vfs. Will there still be any account for me to login?
Then you need to ask VFS as they lodged the application on your behalfGood Luck
"Hi guys, may i know what is the minimum amount in our saving accounts which looks more""decent"" as the supporting document?? Some said rm5000 some said ASD5000 lol that's a huge difference"
It's been a month and 5 days after sending my additional docs and I've not gotten any reply for my ETA. :''( Anyone received anything yet? Is it partly due to the covid-19 issue as well?
"Hi VinI doubt that the Covid 19 would make much difference. This is because much of the approval work for these Visas is probably done in Canberra as far as I know., There is not one confirmed case here. Plus the work load is reduced due the reduce amount of people currently flying.I will admit that I only have rough Idea on how Visas are approved , it comes down to the Government approving some passport countries very quickly. A computer does this. Then there is manual processing, which a case officer would look at. Perhaps even they might need to ask a persons passport country from information or consult and data based to check information on the applicate.What I do know as I speak to the Australian Officer who is based at the Airport in Bangkok. They sometime check passengers who are flying out or get an alert warning. They take the persons passport then they call the office in Bangkok. Give the information and wait for confirmation. I also guess they are checking the Data base and might even make a call to Australia.So, you just have to wait and see if it is approved. Good Luck"
"CJ Why post 280.Most countries around the world will have a rule about funds . An example is Thailand a person has to show funds a VOA is 10,000 Baht . Australia is no different , except you have to show bank records. So a Visa is often for 3 months The cost of Living is quite high in Australia , a person how is getting 5000 AUD would be consider well below the average .Good Luck"
How long does it takes to get your approval? My friend has submit additional information on 20th Feb. Our flight is next week. My friend is considering to get 600 tourist visa. We running out time
Applied on 3rd FebSubmitted additional docs on 4th Feb (received automated email reply)Status now (11/3/2020): no reply
come on 5000 AUD ??seriously? i doubt how many malaysian will have such amount in their savings...can anyone roughly give me a figure for visa application?
"Yes , 5000 AUD is pocket money !!!.Good Luck"
may i know how long is the waiting period?
The wait period is as long as the Government takes to process the application.Good Luck
Even for tourist visa 600?
"Yes. The Government have some figures such as XX% are done in XX days the it goes on.The Government can do as they see fit, might take 5 mins or 5 years or not at all.Good Luck"
does anyone knows if we have to go to go down physically for any appointment for visa 600 ?
"Post # 292Yes they do a full medical check ,including a check that you are not crazy. Then they question you to see if you have been in contact with C 19 .They also check that you have manners , that include Please and Thank you. I suggest having a hair cut before the interview. Do wear your best under wear on the day.Good Luck"
"Hello everyone,I wonder if anyone here still goes ahead with your trip to Australia? Given that we are advised not to travel within these few months because of the virus. I have a trip to Sydney and NZ in the early of June. Some of my travel partners have cancelled the plan, they rather throw away the air ticket & accommodation. Let's share opinion here. Regards."
#294Yea I will be going to Brisbane in May if my visa is granted. Just a 6 days short getaway considering that Aus is not much affected by the virus outbreak. Hopefully the Govt will not impose travel ban on tourists.
"HI, i just wanna asked recently I renewed my passport and my visa from my old passport is still valid. I'm also travelling to Perth next week Sunday so i''m worried i might now have time to buy a new passport, so i was wondering can i bring both passport with me? Thank you"
"Tomorrow is the last day before my scheduled flight the day after. If it fails, I’m gonna be the first one who fail to obtain a visa using Subclass 600 17 days booking before my flight. It is so frustrating I’m not kidding."
"If you have a valid ETA and you’ve since got a new passport, you'll need a new ETA.Hope you font have a Malaysian passport as i cant dee you getting a new visa in time gor travel next week"
#hafizceroyWHATTT? REALLY??you just destroy my positive hope in getting the 600 visa....did you apply using the ImmiAccount or through other source?
Vfs global. Truly shocking. When’s your flight? When did u submit
"All travel into australia and new zealand is now slap with 14 days quarantine. Failure to comply is a fine ranging from AUD 5,000 to AUD 50,000 and very likely POSSIBLE future visa ban with your name for putting Australian in danger. So...... before you can go out and enjoy australia you will have to quarantine yourself in a hotel for 14 days. Only after 14 days you will be able to legally be allow into the community. To those that booked hotel in Australia, you can calculate how much it will cost to quarantine yourself for 14 days. Consider AUD 150/night hotel x 14 nights = AUD 2,100 roughly RM 5,560 (food not yet included) just to quarantine yourself.Edited: 7:28 pm, March 15, 2020 "
I think the best option is to cancel the trip. 1. Check with airlines to see if you could get a refund or credits for future use. 2. Check with hotels if you could get a refund. 3. Try not to organise any overseas holiday within next 6-8 months. Have a nice day.
#hafizceroy i am preparing all necessary documents to be submitted by this week....looking at the current situation it is safe to say let's forget about the trip for now Sigh
"Hi Luigi A, in reference to my post #303 sorry I may have violated thread rule. Remove if inappropriate ya. Thank youmy visa updateApplied on 3rd FebSubmitted additional docs on 4th Feb (received automated email reply)Status now (16/3/2020): no reply"
