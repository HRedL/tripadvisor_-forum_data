"Hallo,stay in koh phangan until October 2014 since I arrived here 2month ago people get sick with dengue fever all over the place und nobody seems to care about it -well I understand that this topic is not popular because of all the tourist business,but people traveling to here should know about it and be warned -it's really serious this year not only view cases.Nearly everybody at my place in sree thanu got it -people change und new ones got it-in hospital the doctors even talk about malaria cases-well no paranoia about dengue, but travelers should know it and take precaution...thank you"
"Dengue fever is all over Thailand, not just the island and responsible travellers usually already know about possible health risks before travelling.I doubt that no one cares about it, but there is nothing to do to prevent it."
"Yes, it's prevalent throughout SEA, many of the bungalow operators do spray, but really what can be done? You have to put the onus on the traveller to take the necessary precautions and not everybody makes themselves aware of the risks and takes preventative action - repellent day and night."
Can anyone verify that the number of Dengue cases has been higher this year?
"The cases have been so high,even the Thai people never experienced before -at my place 10 bungalow nearly everybody had dengue,even the owner and his fam.Since I am 7Weeks here now people came and went -90% got or had it. People who where in hospital talked about-doctors said 160-200 cases only in hospital....so how much really????At my place,arond 20 since I'm here - other places where sometimes nearly empty, because everybody sick...."
Yes even I heard about wide-spreading dengue in Thailand from one one of my uncle who had been there recently. Also I read about it and found that the measures taken by authorities are not sufficient enough to control it on massive scale. People should take necessary precautionary measures on there own. Same goes for travelers also.
Dengue cases are actually lower this year according to this article:thaivisa.com/forum/…
"Maybe in all of Thailand, but surely not in koh phangan-the last 5 years I'm here between march and November and before only very view people got sometimes dengue...well they came to spray, after everybody been already sick-the spraying honestly was a choke..The second time,they came when the Thai people got it and the spraying had ben well done..tourist you should leave your money here and then you should go,without complaining- why should somebody care??"
"The conditions described by snofia indicate an epidemic. So nobody on Phangan cares about an epidemic? Sorry, I find the extent of Dengue cases as claimed to be exaggerated. I hope I am right."
"Snofla, where exactly are you staying on KPG? What is the hostel/hotel called and where is it located?"
Yes where are you staying ? I'm always slightly suspicious of very new posters with scary topics
"Well,it is as it's without getting in to paranoia -people should know and take precautions if they coming here...or experience it for themselves ..not to much of a nice way I can tell you..it doesn't help to close the eyes andTry the ignore it,even the Thais are out of obvious reasons not really interested in making the fact known because short time tourism going somewhere else spending their money and don't want to worry about anything..."
"I'm staying in sreethanu beach,but also in chuloklam and other beaches are people getting it more and more..all I'm saying is take care for yourself and if you getting it,for fevers take paracetamol,no aspirin -naturally take one young papaya leave -only the leave and eat it...wish everyone a nice stay and good health..."
"Excellent, balanced post MrC."
"Yes, Dengue is everywhere. Best way to tackle it is to take precautions yourself. One more thing don't use repellents/drugs in excess as this lead to resistance in dengue causing mosquitoes. Be safe, be happy."
"One day they will invent Doctors and Travel Clinics.Without wishing to hijack this thread is there a thread on TA about Mosquito repellents and which ones people think work?My own experience was using the highly regarded Jaico 25% DEET applied with a rollerball in stripes and with a nice smell. Only thing is I still got bit! Maybe I would have got bitten more without but sometimes it matters to avoid getting bitten at all and this didnt achieve it! When I told someone they said these (all) repellents are like a garnish to the mosquito, just makes you taste even better!"
"""... is there a thread on TA about Mosquito repellents and which ones people think work?"" It is a regularly asked question particularly on the main Thailand, Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui forums. Just use the search function for something like ""Best insect repellents"" on those forums (the Phuket one is probably best then Thailand then Bangkok). The results will first come up by relevance to the term you have put in. To Resort by most recent just click on the drop down box at the right hand side and select date. If you use the main Thailand forums it will search all forums which is a good start.We usually take Boots Repel Tropical Strength either spray or wipes or Jungle Formula but because we stay for 5 months (and a full supply too heavy to pack) we buy locally in the super or mini mart or pharmacy Johnson's Off, Sketolene with or without Deet, both sprays and my wife who is VERY susceptible to bites and was recommended, started to use and found very effective a 50ml milky roll on called Jaico from the pharmacy at about 350 baht and which I've just found on Amazon for £7.78."
I've just returned from 7 days on the island. We hired a jeep for the whole time and travelled around heaps and met lots of people. Didn't hear one word about Dengue fever...
"MrCycling, not that I don't believe you, but where did you hear the 62 per 1000 people figure from?"
Hello there! Is there anyone who can tell me if there is increase in Dengue cases in Phuket this year. I am going to there in July for honeymoon with my wife. What is the possibility percentage of contracting it?
"Why ask about Dengue fever in Phuket on the Koh Phangan forum? Better posting the question there although you previously have done so. If there was a significant increase anywhere in Thailand you wouldn't need to ask, people would report it.Just do as you have previously been advised."
Would it be better to go repellent in London airport or in Koh Phangan. Travelling in August presume I can just get it in a 7 11 Thanks in advance
"Boots Repel Tropical strength is good and cheaper than local ones. But ""Off"" and Sketolene if avialablelocally in Phangan are very effective."
"You can't let Dengue put you off going, it's just been announced that 18 cases of Dengue have broken out here in Queensland recently."
!!!! and we are coming to Brisbane in February!!!! Looks like we'll need the Off there as well!
"Don't worry Arandora, it's in Far North Queensland, but it said on the radio that it is very unusual for so many outbreaks at this time of year - it has been very warm for the time of year here on the Gold Coast, should be much cooler by now. You will still need your OFF for pesky mosquitoes though that's for sure."
Thank you. I am new to trip advisor so bear with me. Thank you again.
No problem but your posts will probably remain unanswered if you post to the wrong forum. :-)
"We have just returned from a wonderful holiday in Koh Phangan. Unfortunately, both our children-aged 8 and 10 were extremely sick 4 days after we left. We were in Bangkok when they got sick and we thought it was flu- as both children had it, We stayed in our hotel and calmed the extremely high fever-41 degrees. As soon as we arrived home to Europe we went straight to the hospital as the children were so sick. They had their blood tested and have confirmed Dengue fever. They have been very unwell, I wouldn't let it put you off going to this wonderful island, but I would take extra care and be very aware that there is Dengue on the island. We didn't know that it was such a problem on Phangan before we went. Another child who we met when we were there also had confirmed Dengue. After 10 days the children are both getting better and are today fever free. Maybe we were just really unlucky."
I hope your children get well very soon.
"Dengue is all over the place. I've had it twice after going to Koh Lanta. It's unpleasant but it hasn't put me off going back to Thailand - even if you get it the risk of death is not that high, and frankly I think I'm more likely to die on the roads, or by drowning in the ocean, or from being electrocuted by the dodgy wiring. Especially the roads! Or I could die of a heart attack or whatever would have killed me at home, which is probably what kills the most tourists in Thailand. There are risks everywhere. I just make sure I've always got good travel insurance with unlimited medical cover."
"With due respect to Jean W you should not underestimate the seriousness of Dengue Fever and its potential fatal consequences, especially for children. See report from the World Health Organisation at www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/ Since there is no cure for it travel insurance, although essential, will not spare you and your loved ones from its consequences, so please heed the advice to take precautions."
