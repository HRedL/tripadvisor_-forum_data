We are supposed to leave for St Thomas this Fri morning and am considering canceling our vaca. Was just curious if many others are canceling or still planning to go?

My sentiments exactly!
We are set to leave this Sunday for a week and I’m actively watching the situation. I am concerned about travel and infrastructure issues not “catching” the coronavirus. The panic caused by the spread of the coronavirus is changing daily life in the US at a rapid pace.
"4 days ago, new CDC guidance: For people over 60 OR with health issues: ""The CDC guidance comes as two top infectious disease experts with ties to the federal government have advised people over 60 and those with underlying health problems to strongly consider avoiding activities that involve large crowds.Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the CDC, said these two groups should consider avoiding activities such as traveling by airplane, going to movie theaters, attending family events, shopping at crowded malls, and going to religious services.People in these two groups ""should strongly consider not doing these activities at this juncture,"" Schaffner said.""We are over 60. We cancelled our trip to STX yesterday. Supposed to have gone last week in March. Would not want to be quarantined for 14 days anywhere but home and if you travel anywhere using public transportation you are taking a risk. No amount of washing your hands will protect you from getting the virus from someone who has it if they should cough, sneeze.It is very contagious. We were able to re-book our accommodations and AA was very helpful in getting 95% of our airline ticket money back in the form of a voucher good for one year. Thought is that the situation is going to get worse before it gets better."
"I agree, everyone should understand their personal situation and modify their plans accordingly. I however would love to be stuck in STT and just have to work remotely :)"
"We are still planning to leave in 2 days but monitoring the situation closely, especially with Trump's decision to halt flights from the EU. There was a 1 day window given before taking effect so I'm hoping if we did need to cut our week short, we can do it. Tomorrow might bring a different decision but as of now, we are still going. None in our family of 4 are over 60 or immunosuppressed."
"I agree--will only cancel if my plane won't fly.Edited: 12:29 pm, March 12, 2020 "
We are scheduled to leave Boston one week from today. As of now we are coming. We needed to cancel in November 2017 due to hurricanes and finally got back last March but still felt the effects of hurricanes damage.sooo looking forward to this trip with things back in full swing such as ferry and restaurants praying we don’t need to cancel. Love our friends on Stt and hope our plans don’t fall thru!
Updates and closings from the Governor today:https:/…
We ended up canceling our trip. Too many unknowns for me to take my family a plane flight away froM our home and too many moving pieces with my business (remote working being a strong possibility whereas it wasn’t even a thought last Sunday).
"We cancelled our trip as well. This virus spreads when people travel. We aren't high risk, but don't want to cause unnecessary problems for people who are. Paradise can wait."
"Good on you, SN137! Wish more thought as you do."
We are due to land in STT in three weeks to spend a week in St John. We do not plan on canceling at this time. We have our fingers crossed that we will be able to fly and not get stranded on the way.
I'm still going
"We're scheduled for next week, and we will be cancelling. Not because we're particularly concerned about ourselves (mid-30s and healthy), but we don't want to be the ones responsible for spreading it to anyone else."
"We are scheduled to be in STT from 4/10/20-4/17/20. We haven't cancelled yet, but are keeping a close eye on the situation. We have until 3/27 at midnight to get a refund on our condo."
"If you can cancel. cancel. Things will not be back to normal in a few weeks on the mainland, let alone the islands."
I am in St. Thomas now but returning home today. Most everything is still open but it is pretty quiet. You probably not going to have live music and any large gatherings and no cruise ships are no longer coming. It’s actually nice to not have the crowds and the population is healthy.
"Wishing you a safe and uneventful trip back home, Bill. Sorry I didn't get to see you but next time ...!"
