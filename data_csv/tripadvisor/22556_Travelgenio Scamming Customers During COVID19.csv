"Anyone had any experience with Travelgenio lately?I booked two flights with them which were due to fly out on 06/04/20 and 10/04/20. First flight cost in excess of £844 and second flight around £734.For a while I have been requesting for a refund and I kept getting told that they have received my email and they will get back to me 72 hours before my flight.After nor hearing anything from Travelgenio I decided to contact them again yesterday (04/04/20) only to receive a disturbing email from them telling me I have a pay a fine of roughly €600 per person. The reason for this is aparantly because my flight is confirmed. However Airindia have announced on Twitter that they have cancelled all flights till 14th April. Also, when I check my booking on their website I can see that my outgoing flight is no longer there. Aswell as this, the government of India is not allowing any tourist to enter the country. Other agencies have seen the cancellations and are giving full refunds. And I'm making this up, my cousins and parents booked with Budget air, who emailed them informing them that due to flight cancellations they will refund the flight. So why is Travelgenio not doing the same???Travelgenio are clearly trying to pull a fast one on me and because of how short notice they have given me I.e my flight being due to fly tomorrow, is trying to push me to accept their fine. Absolutely disgusting!Someone please advise what the best thing to do is as I feel like I am being Royaly Scammed."
"Why not read the many, many other threads about Travelgenio? You can find lots of information in them.Travelgenio charges fees, not fines, which you agreed to pay when you purchased your ticket.Edited: 7:31 am, April 05, 2020 "
You are not being scammed but they are in meltdown trying to deal with thousands of cancellations etc like yours due to the virus - you appointed them as your agents and will now have to deal with the consequences of that decision.
"So why are other agencies giving a full refund because the flight IS cancelled? If a flight is cancelled and they are telling me that it's not,you dont think thats dodgy?"
"Re-reading, are you saying Travelgenio states your flight is not cancelled, but the airline says it is, thus TG is charging this ""fine?"" If your flight has actually been cancelled, you are due a full refund, minus any fees that TG is going to charge.Edited: 8:23 am, April 05, 2020 "
Hence why I tried to contact them time and time again in advance so I know what's going on. Every business is in a meltdown but they come up with strategies to overcome the issue. Not cut off thier phone lines and not reply to customers.
"Yes l, fees which apply in normal circumstances. The flight is cancelled, so they wouldve received a refund from the airliner."
"Yes. The airliner has cancelled the flight. Travelgenio are telling me it is not. I sent them a screenshot if the flight status too.Yet still, they are telling me i have to pay cancellation fees.Edited: 8:27 am, April 05, 2020 "
"Not all companies are coming up with a strategy to manage this issue - the ample threads on here about different agencies is illustrating this.Especially the companies that great-looking deals, like Travelgenio. There were threads and threads before this global pandemic started complaining about their poor customer service. Given how travel agents tend to not be considered essential businesses, it's hardly surprising they they continue to offer poor customer service."
"They may not have received a refund from the airline. A lot of airlines are not eager to refund and are pushing vouchers instead. I don't know what happened to yours, but I am sure the Travelgenio bot will be along soon to reassure you."
"Also, are you SURE that you did not instruct them (by saying that you wished to cancel ) BEFORE the date that airline cancelled the flight in its entirety ? In your original post you said "".. For a while I have been requesting for a refund and I kept getting told that they have received my email and they will get back to me 72 hours before my flight...."" That suggests to me that you may have jumped the gun and did that before Air India's announcement in which case TravelGenio probably submitted a cancellation request to them then which would mean that any subsequent decision to cancel the entire flight by the airline would be irrelevant to the cancellation request already submitted . If you said you wanted to cancel before AirIndia actually grounded the flights then the original terms of your ticket will apply and if they were non-refundable you would not get a full refund anyway Please explain in a way that is more specific about what happened on what date so we can understand what you appear to be saying. For example - in your original post you said "" ..when I check my booking on their website.."" but did not say WHOSE website - TGs or AirIndia 's so how are we supposed to understand properly what the situation is and sympathise or make suggestions ??HOWEVER, one thing is clear - you are not being ""fined"" because regardless of whether you (via TravelGenio) cancelled your tickets or the airline did, you entered into a contractual agreement with TravelGenio when you booked those flights to pay their admin fees for handling and cancellation or amendment fees - it will all be set out in their T&Cs which you would have agreed to when going through the booking process ! The fees being charged will be in addition to any amendment fees charged by the airline"
