"Hey everyone. My husband and I are going to be visiting Alaska in the summer of 2012 for 2 weeks. We both have always wanted to go and love hiking and camping. So I am starting to research and am feeling very overwhelmed. We have things we want to do (go up the Dalton Highway, see the northern lights, visiting as many national parks as possible, etc.). If we are spending 2 weeks in Alaska, where do you suggest we visit or maybe structure our trip?We plan to fly into Anchorage, rent a car, and go straight to REI to rent a tent and sleeping bags. Then just drive the state for two weeks. But having a car for 2 weeks can get pricey, especially if you go with a company that is ok with the Dalton Highway. So maybe trains for part of it?Any input and suggestions of things to research would be so wonderful! Thanks!"
"Hi, welcome to the forum.If you book the car 11 months in advance, you can get really great deals. Obviously, it couldn't be driven on Dalton, but you could rent one of the specially-equipped cars in Fairbanks from companies that do permit driving there. More info: http://wikitravel.org/en/Dalton_Highway . They run $200+ per day, which is likely more than you'll be paying for the other car for a week, so you won't feel so bad leaving the first car parked for a day or two.... Another other choice is to do the shuttle drive to Arctic Circle, but those are about $200 pp...how far were you wanting to drive?I would not suggest you rent a tent and sleeping bags. Take your own tent (you'll be familiar with it) and possibly sleeping bags and other equipment, or maybe buy the bags in Anchorage if you're short on room in your luggage.Trains give you NO flexibility. I'd stick with the car. If you want to do a train trip just for the experience, consider a day trip from Anchorage at the beginning of your vacation (Whittier glacier cruise, Spencer Glacier trip, etc.)There are several National Parks in Alaska: nps.gov/applications/parksearch/state.cfm… . The 3 that you can get to easily by car would be Kenai Fjords NP (Seward), Denali NP (near Healy) and Wrangell-St. Elias NP (near Valdez). Visiting those and hiking would easily take up the rest of your 2 weeks.Things to do near Seward: hike Harding Icefield (6 to 8 hrs), walk to the face of Exit Glacier, Kenai Fjords wildlife cruise, kayaking.At Denali: great place to hike. Maybe stay at Tek CG and get a Tek Pass which gives you unlimited rides on the shuttles (1 reserved trip, and the rest on a space-available basis). You also might want to stay a night or two at one of the other CGs such as Wonder Lake or Igloo.At Wrangell-St. Elias: Root Glacier hike, mill tour, all-day mine hike, etc. This is another place your rental vehicle *might* not allow, so check with the website for McCarthy Lodge for their help on rentals, or else park your ""cheap"" rental at Chitina and take the Kennicott shuttle into McCarthy and back out.BTW, don't count on seeing the Northern Lights. If you go to Alaska in late August/early September, you *might*. It doesn't get dark enough at night before then. However, be aware that some activities close down around the end of August, so take that into account when planning your route."
"You mention the Dalton Hwy (also referred to as the Haul Rd.). This can be a great drive/trip (wife & I did it in 2006 & it was a WOW - if you really love the outdoors!). If you do it, are you intending on going all of the way to Deadhorse/Prudhoe Bay or is your intention to just reach the Arctic Circle or some other idea? This would be an important decision as this could be a very significant part of the trip (time, price, preparation and very careful thinking)???This answer would definitely help the ""wisest"" of TA's posters give their best opinions.Good luck,Scottp.s. - my personal preference would be to have an automobile for the whole trip so to best control/maximize time doing exactly what I wanted to do (remember, in the summer it doesn't get dark; so you can really maximize your activity & sleep when you get home!)Edited: 9 years ago "
"Thanks for the input. First, We will be visiting from NC. So packing our own gear isn't really an option. I don't mind renting from REI because I work there so it won't cost much to rent gear.I checked into the train and you're right in that it is not very flexible. Plus with the prices, it make much more sense to just rent a car.I would love to do the whole Dalton HW, but it seems difficult once you get up to the oil fields and I don't know if my husband wants to go through all that. Driving the highway was something I really wanted to do. So I was debating going up as far as Coldfoot. I can get my national park stamp and do a little bit of hiking before turning around (probably spend the night). My husband really wants to see the glaciers and go to Denali. I also want to get up to Kotzebue since that is a central town for several of the national parks in the north.As far as the Northern Light are concerned, it is still possible to see them, correct? We are basing this off of an experience my husband had. He led a 3 week diving trip to Canada as a counselor a summer camp. He said he saw them quite often. Granted, it was always at 3am. But I would be will to do that to see it. Of course, we could be completely off as well.Thanks again for the help!"
"Not unless by summer you mean very late August or early September - it isn't really dark until the middle of August, so no northern lights. :)"
"“We are basing this off of an experience my husband had. He led a 3 week diving trip to Canada as a counselor a summer camp. He said he saw them quite often. Granted, it was always at 3am.”Right now we just go out of the Solar Minimum meaning that there is not much solar release to give us those fantastic light shows. Basically if you see the lights you just lucked out. From my little bit of experience living here in Fairbanks since 1992 I would say that your chances will be slim when visiting during the split days. Still can’t figure out why people want to drive the Haul Road all the way to Dead Horse. Once you descend from Atigun Pass it is like flatsville on the slope. If you go up there make sure you have some Cutters with you to get the mosquitoes off"
"""We will be visiting from NC. So packing our own gear isn't really an option.""Sure it is, lol. I take mine from Manitoba, fti takes his from Minnesota, etc. But up to you if you'd rather rent....and maybe get stuck with a tent you're not familiar with, and have to put it up for the first time in pouring rain, lol.Here is a great blog by one of our occasional posters about the drive on Haul Road (thanks, yescanada, for posting the link recently--I *finally* remembered to copy it!): susanstevenson.com/blog/…more-114 . It should give you a lot of info to help you make your decision."

I prefer to be familiar with my own gear, know how to assemble it quickly, know it is clean, etc. I can't imagine using a rental sleeping bag.As I said in another thread recently, in one piece of checked luggage I pack:4-person tent (that I only use for max three people)sleeping bagmat for under the sleeping bagtwo tarps (one for under and one for over the tent)small Coleman one-burner stove (and now also an even smaller isopropane burner)one frying panone potlarge stirring spoonmedium size sharp knifecoolerThat can all easily fit in one legal size checked piece of luggage weighing 50 pounds or less. I have packed it all in one separately piece, but for me it ends up being more efficient to put some of the camping stuff in each of my two checked pieces. Just easier to pack that way. I can throw various smaller things inside the cooler so that the cooler itself literally takes up no extra room, for example.Granted, with my status on Delta I don't pay for checked luggage, but even if someone pays, it costs $25-$50 for the second piece of luggage each way. I can't imagine paying under $100 for two weeks of renting camping equipment.I would try to have your dates nailed down as close to 11 months in advance as possible. Even if you end up paying a bit more for your flights, you will save hundreds of dollars on your car rental by booking early. Generally renting the car off-airport Monday 8am through Saturday noon will be cheaper than renting at the airport. Keep that in mind with your dates.I think that the loop including Seward (Kenai Fjords), Denali, Fairbanks, Dalton Highway, Wrangell/St. Elias NP will be a good one. In fact, you might consider an overnight to Lake Clark NP for bear viewing (figure $800/person or more for the overnight).If you are considering heading to national parks from Kotzebue, figure skipping one or more of the ""easier"" ones to get to or planning at least three weeks (or, as some people do, run yourself ragged, spend a night here and a night there and say you ""did"" the Alaska national parks!)."
"""I can't imagine using a rental sleeping bag.""Ya know, I don't want to freak anyone out, but that made me think of all the recent articles about the bed bug epidemic throughout North America...."
"Now that you mention it, yeah, we could bring our sleeping bags. The tent we have at home is rei. So I don't mind renting it b/c I already work on them.I am looking at doing a overnight tip up to Kotzebue or nome. Just to get a taste of it. I know I am going to have to come back again anyway. That loop sounds pretty good. I'll map it out and see what I come up with."

"I loved my Dalton Hwy/Prudhoe Bay experience. It's a tough one (even a little of it) and with so much of Alaska being amazing, I personally don't see racing through a tiny bit of it at the sacrifice of something else.Here's my ""standard"" post I use based on my experience on the road:This great drive is all about respect, care and caution.I would not consider it dangerous; but you must exercise care/caution because of the quality of the road. The road is a mixture of ""hard pack"", dirt, pavement (very little pavement & it was very poor quality), gravel & stone. Drivers need to count on flat tires & cracked/broken windshields - sort of plan for the worst & hope for the best. We did not damage our vehicle at all. This drive/road is all about respecting the road & the trucks that make a living on it.My wife and I drove the Dalton Hwy (aka Haul Rd) in June 2006. We did it with our front wheel drive Honda CR-V (2003). We were not in a rush (took a full week) and had a ""trip of a lifetime"" (lots of camping & hiking &, of course, a swim in the Arctic).I don't recall exactly; but I'm pretty sure (depending on road conditions) we spent about 2 or 3 hours driving at speeds of 5 to 10 mph (very slow), we spent about 3 or 4 hours at 25 to 30 mph and we spent the rest of the time on very hard pack dirt road that you could drive very fast on (60 mph +).This is a long drive and I feel one must love nature to tolerate it one way & really love nature to be tolerate it both ways. We (wife & I) LOVE nature & did this drive not just for the destination; but for everything along the way.I've listed some links below which you might find useful.Good luck,Scottfavorite link:alaskageographic.org/uploads/pdf/dalton-vg20…other useful links:…state.ak.us/stwdplng/…byways-dalton.shtmlfairbanks-alaska.com/dalton-highway.htmwww.bellsalaska.com/myalaska/daltonhw.htmlblm.gov/ak/…dalton_hwy.htmlhttp://www.alaskageographic.org/"
