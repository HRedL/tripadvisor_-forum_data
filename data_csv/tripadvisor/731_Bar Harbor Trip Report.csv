"Just got back from 2 nights in Bar Harbor. Great Trip!Stayed at the Bar Harbor Inn. Got a good rate on an Ocean View room with a private deck. The view made the stay. Don't think I would have paid for a Non-Ocean View room. Great location but the rooms where just so, so and the dining was overpriced. The Reading Room was sold out every night we were there. Should have booked it when we booked the room. Terrace Cafe food quality was just OK, but the view is perfect. ($280 for 4 people dinner). Free Cont. Breakfast was worth what you paid for it. Expected more from a first class Inn.Crowds around town were manageable and everyone was wearing masks.Drove loop road when we arrived on the first day. Sandy Beach and Thunder Hole were very crowded Parking was backed up a good 1/4 mile from the entrances. Otter Cliffs were much less crowded. we were able to park and walked along the coast. Very Pretty.Next morning picked up bikes from Acadia Bikes. They were great to work with. The bikes were in great shape and they gave us great directions for the carriage roads. We did the three pond loop from Jordan House parking lot. Took about two hours and the hills were not bad. Planned on Popovers and lunch at the Jordan House, but they were only doing take-out at a small window with a huge line and no tables to sit at. So we headed to Southwest Harbor to see the Light House and have Lobster Rolls at Beal's. Beal's was closed on Monday, so we went to Seafood Ketch which was perfect. Nice outside patio great lobster rolls. Bass Harbor Light is a little disappointing, because the famous shot isn't what you actually see. But it is a nice side trip. Stopped at Seawall Park on the way back and that was a very nice walk on the rocks along the shore. Dropped the bikes off, showered and headed to West Street Cafe for dinner. BEST MEAL of the trip.Tuesday we got up at 4am and went for the ""Sunrise"". Amazed at the number of people that were already there! Go early and bring some coffee and a snack, It Was BEAUTIFUL! We left Cadillac Mountain and drove the Loop Road again. This time there were NO CROWDS! Pulled right up to Sandy Beach and Thunder Hole. Really enjoyed having them to ourselves. Back to the Inn for breakfast and check out then off to North East Harbor and Sail Acadia for the 10am Sail on The Linda. An old wooden freedom sloop. Winds were light but the Captain was great and we saw Porpoises, a Light House and some beautiful ships and yachts. It was worth every penny and a relaxing way to spend the last day on MDI. One final word, I was very impressed with the way Maine is handling Covid. Everybody wore masks, everything was wiped down and we felt very safe."
"Nice trip report.The Bar Harbor Inn is our favorite lodging in Bar Harbor and we like ocean view rooms. Perhaps if you return do stay at the West Street Hotel with it's roof top pool. A nice boutique lodging that we would stay at again if the Bar Harbor Inn ocean view rooms were full..""Bass Harbor Light is a little disappointing, because the famous shot isn't what you actually see. "" Well, to see this view you need to scramble down to the edge of the water. Best to be there for sunset.Edited: 2:38 pm, August 13, 2020 "
How do you get down to the rocks below the Lighthouse? We tried but there was a No Trespassing sign.
"Here are the ""trail"" directions:https:/â€¦bassharborheadlight.phpPerhaps because of COVID-19 the NPS has closed off this area for now"
Almost no one was wearing masks at the park or in the town or anywhere when we were there...?
