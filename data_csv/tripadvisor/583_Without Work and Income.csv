Coronavirus and its related international travel restrictions is causing real pain to so many in Cambodia. Here is a very up to date overview as things stand today for those who are self-employed or in the informal economy.https:/…Best regards. Ian
"And yet the government stated only three days ago that employment was at 99.3 %. And this with countless TCF - Textile, Clothing and Footwear workers stood down or sacked and ditto for the many formerly employed in the tourism related industries.https:/…The Cambodian workers are not fooled but are certainly long suffering.Best regards. Ian"
"I am starting to get requests for ""Rice Money"" from friends in Cambodia who have become unemployed/laid off work and are yet to receive any Government assistance or assistance from their former employers.''These workers do not have ""savings"" as they live from fortnight payment to fortnight payment, when it is on time. And some are many weeks in arrears with wages due to them.Most are asking for assistance to buy a 50 Kg bag of reasonable quality rice at US$30.Best regards. Ian"
"Ian,Please advise, maybe PM, best way to make a contribution.Thanks Marcus"
"Both interesting articles. However curiously, the second article is dated 29th March 2019. The current situation is a real ""kick in the guts"" for those who borrowed several thousand dollars to buy a new LPG tuk tuk, which at any other time would have appeared to be a sound financial decision."
"Hello MarcusThis is not an organized thing. It is just that a number of Cambodians who know me well and have been laid off work indefinitely have sent me messages over social media or text messages asking if I could help them.In theory, the factory workers in most cases are technically ""suspended"", not sacked - because if ""sacked"" Cambodian Labour Law requires their former employer to pay them out all wages and overtime due to them as well as their ""Seniority Payments"" - are supposed to be getting a payment of US$70 per month comprising $30 from their former employer and $40 from the government. However, up to now, workers from the Jun Huong Factory at Chbar Ampov 2 and many other factories have not received any such payments.Then there are friends in the informal economy who work for daily wages that are out of work because all other jobs have dried up too.Previously, a Karong 50 Kg bag of cheap rice could be bought for $25 but now costs $30. Good rice starts at $1 per Kg and upwards now.So when I get these requests, I am able through a licenced Cambodian Money Transfer service in Cabramatta in Western Sydney that is part of the AUSTRAC System to counter money laundering etc, to send my friends US$30 which goes immediately from western Sydney to Phnom Penh where it is then transferred to WING, a very simple but highly secure money transfer service for those that do not have a bank account - which is circa 85% or a bit more of Cambodians but who do have a phone that can receive a text message to take their coded payment advice to any of the 5,500 Wing branches throughout Cambodia and get immediate full payment in cash. There are now several such systems in Cambodia but Wing was the original and still the best in my experience and is the service with the most outlets throughout every part of Cambodia. This means that they can have the $30 in hand in between 3 to 4 hours, often far less time, after me paying it in over the counter in western Sydney.Rice is the staple basic food for all Cambodians and a 50 Kg Karong/Sack of rice gives my friends food security if nothing else and lets them be a bit more relaxed about their situation.I can't help my regular tuk tuk driver who asked for help. Work was plentiful for him last year so he bought a 12 seater van using a bank loan - then along comes Covid-19 and he has no customers - and is now unable to service the loan. And he is far from being alone in this situation. Nor can he sell the van as there are now no buyers either!So you see Marcus, it's pretty much a one to one thing based on personal friendships past and present.Just one slight problem for me though, the Australian Dollar retail exchange rate is at near lows when it comes to transferring money overseas. But I will get it all back in goodwill many times over in the years to come. That's what friends are for.I hope that this explains things for you?Many of us on forum have Cambodian friends in need right now.Best regards. Ian"
Thanks for the response Ian. If anything else occurs please let me know.Marcus
"Hello MarcusYou and others may care to consider an organization that really does need ""Rice Money"" as it has a great number of young mouths to feed and others to assist - The CCF - Cambodian Children's Fund. I've spent some time with the CCF.Please see:https:/…Best regards. Ian"
"ABC's and Rice is another NGO helping provide food for people struggling in Siem Reap... also Cambodian Cocoon...cheers, baddles"
Thanks Ian & Baddles.For others CCF have a 'Justgiving' link on their website so can accept worldwide donations.
This confirms that the government has not made any payments so far to those out of work due to Covid-19https:/…Best regards. Ian
