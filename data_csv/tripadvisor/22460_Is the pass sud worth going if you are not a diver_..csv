What else is to do there?Thank you
"It is a nice scenic hour to hour and a half boat ride. Depends on how choppy lagoon is the day you go. You will have lunch. We were diving so not sure what else to do there. Your boat will be following the divers so you will be on the water all day, except for lunch."
Thank you! I am debating if I should stay at the Motu Aito paradise or not for 2 or 3 nights and be bored to death with nothing to do when you do not dive (what else can you do there to occupy your time?) or stay at the Hawaiki lodge for 3 nights. Apart cycling one day the 36 miles R/T what else can you do here also . They have excursions to both pass (north and South) Is it worth it with picnic ?
"We stayed at Havaiki in 2010, before affiliation with Pearl. It was great. Back then no a/c, very sauvage. We dove the whole time we were there so I have no personal experience with excursions there. We have never been bored no matter where we have been in FP. Lagoon is beautiful. Swim, snorkel during the day, get on the bikes. Take the canoe out. I am sure the excursions are worth it. Nice day on the water...you will be wiped out afterwards. When are you planning on going?"
July August or beginning of September depending how the coronavirus goes?
"Not to be a downer, but probably not going to happen this year. They cannot take a chance of letting tourists back in until a vaccine is deployed."
