I haven't been to London since the 90's but making a return trip. Didn't eat the beef back then but I would like to this time. Is the whole mad cow epidemic completely in the clear?
Be not afeared. The isle is full of noises ... but the mooing of mad cows is not one of them.
Yes. Safest anywhere on the planet because of all of that. And you can drink the water and we have electricity.
And we have banks and shops these days.
"If you mean BSE, or Bovine Spongiform Encpahlitis, then you need have no fears.British Beef is from carefully managed, tested and certified herds, and our inspection methods and standards are now probably the most stringent in the world, with every carcass being directly traceable to the farm where it was reared, the place where it was slaughtered, and the Food Standards Agency accreditation of safely follows it from farm to butcher, and then on to the place serving it.Bon Apetit!"
Unless it's really horse meat of course:)
"My God...not been to London since the 1890s...things are very different now...thanks to Marconi, Watt, Baird and of course London's Candle makers.EnjoyAnthony"
"The only mad cow in my corner of the UK is me....... , "" Moooondial""!"
Try Aberdeen Angus (yes that's a type of beef not a guy) it's totally delicious.Ironically the Mad Cow that isn't Mon happened in Europe but that's been kept quiet. Our food is now so regulated you won't get better anywhere.Currently eating sausages (red wine and garlic) from a Devon farm where they can tell you the name of the mum and dad (I stopped her there) and the butcher can tell you the name of the local farmer.
"Mooooondial can't be mad, - there is no madness in Kent.One can get mad out of joy at Madness concert in O2, and drive to Kent. It's my itinerary, though I don't owe copyright to it.Big question is: Are you going to cook for yourself? Or, you'll be staying in hotel/B&B?If first, you'll need recommendations on proper butcher, if second - on good steakhouse.We've had the pleasure of tasting Aberdeen Angus steaks on many occasions - splendid by all means. I've always thought, best steaks in Europe are in Wallonie ( Southern Belgium). British steaks can be just as revealing.Just to be fair: Black Welsh Beef was just as yummy. Maybe we're not such a meat specialists though.Yuri."
"Yes, you will be fine..."
"probably the safest place in the world to eat beef. I've sometimes bought beef or lamb direct from the farmer, best way to get your meat but second best is a farmers market. Personally I'm not a great fan of restaurant beef since I prefer my meat not to walk off the plate."
I love horse meat! Joe Beef and Liverpool House in Montreal serve the most excellent horse dishes.
"I have only eaten horse twice. Once in the old Yugoslavia when it was dished up as Spaghetti Bolognese and another time in rural France.Not something I will be trying again, thanks!"
"""Personally I'm not a great fan of restaurant beef since I prefer my meat not to walk off the plate.""That has me confused.Do you mean they can't cook out properly, ie it is to rare or that it is infested with so many other things that out is capable of walking off the plate unaided?(metaphorically speaking that is)"

Yuri there was a scandal a couple of years ago in the UK when some processed foods sold as beef were found to be horse.
"There is nothing wrong with horsemeat.It just goes against some peoples sensibilities.It is as good as beef, but it is not beef.This thread is about beef. Please can it get back on topic?As to ""restaurant beef"" being too rare, it should be served at least ""pink"" (traditionally) but any restaurant should serve it how YOU wish, if they are worth their salt....."

British beef is safer than American beef.
"<There is nothing wrong with horsemeat.It just goes against some peoples sensibilities.It is as good as beef, but it is not beef.>I agree. It's leaner then beef, had it a couple of times in Japan.....sushi restaurant of all places.Edited: 3 years ago "
"We've had the pleasure of tasting Aberdeen Angus steaks on many occasions - splendid by all means. =======Indeed, But don't go to the ""Angus Steakhouse"", which is an ultra low quality chain that plays on the name of the Aberdeen Angus cow. Aberdeen Angus beef good. Angus Steakhouse chain restaurants really bad!"
"In fairness (I was being sarcastic btw), the horsemeat scandal affected some of the supermarket chains who were selling products with lower grades of meat in pies/mince dishes, and regardless of the benefits of horsemeat, it was not advertised as such, which was the problem, not health. I don't think it affected restaurants selling steak/roast beef dishes if IIRC.There are many more good steak and beef restaurants now than in the 90's though I would avoid Angus and Steak and co (part of the same group)."
"I dont like my meat to be rare. For some meat this is dangerous because thorough cooking is necessary to kill off potential infection. As for cooking it the way the customer wants - chefs generally cook meat rare and either by design or from lack of practise make a hash of anything else. So I eat beef at home - and duck telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknew…Any chef who thinks well cooked meat has to be ""as tough as old boots"" hasnt learnt how to cook"
"""chefs generally cook meat rare and either by design or from lack of practise make a hash of anything else""I have to say I don't generally have that issue although many years ago I did have a huge argument in a restaurant when an allegedly rare steak arrived cremated. The chef, who eventually felt the need to come out of the kitchen to confront me, told me that because it was chargrilled there was no way it could be cooked rare.Paid for our starters and left.Worrying though that a chef didn't understand the basics."
I've just seen Dick Whittington and his cat.......................
">>I dont like my meat to be rare. For some meat this is dangerous because thorough cooking is necessary to kill off potential infection.<<There is nothing ""dangerous"" about rare beef, or a lot of other meats for that matter. A not-over cooked steak is far my succulent and delicious. Buying a nice quality piece of steak and then cremating it is sacrilege. You might as well have bought something from the Value range.Personally I always have my steak medium-rare. Very tasty."
"""There is nothing wrong with horsemeat"" maybe if it's specifically been bred for human consumption but in the case of the horsemeat scandal I suspect they were just doing the local vets a favour by disposing of any old mare that had seen it's day!However you like your beef / steak you should be asked when ordering. If not, and you don't want it rare and prefer it cooked through (each to their own but don't then complain it's chewy!) then make sure you check with the waiting staff and specify how you'd like it cooked. Duck and lamb will usually come pink in the middle unless you request otherwise."
I always have my Steak Tartare well done.
>>I always have my Steak Tartare well done.<<LOL! ;-)
"there is a considerable difference between just touching the pan and cremated, even if most chefs seem to be incapable of recognising that. I find raw beef tough and properly cooked beef - not burnt but cooked - more tender. Each to their own but I'm tired of chefs stating as a fact that raw meat is more tender because they cant cook."
"Wow I am the OP and this thread took a turn about well done vs rare beef. I love my steak medium rare and love tare tare. Too bad prion diseases aren't affected by how long you cook the meat, which was my original concern. As an American, you have to understand we were scared to death of mad cow outbreak in the 90's. It was a big news story, kind of like swine flu and Zika, but for a longer period of time. We were brainwashed to believe if we went to Great Britain and had some beef, are brains would shortly turn to mush. As you can imagine that kind of indoctrination as a younger lad can result in imprinted paranoi in our brains. However I will have the beef. I arrive on a Sunday and thinking of getting a Sunday roast of beef at Blacklocks."
"You say you were brainwashed. Why couldn't you question what you were told? Why do you believe rubbish about diseases in foreign places, eg BSE, Zika, Ebola, swine, avian, etc etc.Surely you must realise you get fed a lot a pap from the media, etc?"
"London is dangerous -you can't eat the beef, and look out for Jack the Ripper prowling in the famous London fog."
"IME, Rules has wonderful steaks (as well as delicious game and a great atmosphere).http://rules.co.uk/"
""" waiters who chase you out of restaurants if you don't tip ...""That's definitely NOT a myth.:-)"
well as an American omnivore you might prefer to be in Britain than America https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct…and as a tartare eater google Maillard effect as an explanation of why cooked meat can taste better
"In US and Canada, you are disqualified from giving blood if you spent 3 months or more in the U.K. Anytime from 1980 to 1996. Almost 200 people died from eating the infected beef and many more people may have it as its incubation period can be decades. The US has now just began talks of importing Irish and British beef after a 20 plus year ban. US has 2 kinds of populations and is mirrored by 2 food industries. One feeds the masses. The middle America. They buy the hormone injected cows fed with gmo corn and soy crap and don't give a damn about what they are eating. The much smaller coastal ""elite"" educated population eat only grass fed, pastured, small farm produced meat where they are as healthy and good tasting beef and milk as anywhere in the world. Of course this meat is much more expensive."
The USA also gets the odd case of BSE in cattle. If you were British and sensible you either stopped eating beef when the talk of BSE started - or you ate only beef bought from organic farms where you knew they didnt feed the cattle the sort of rubbish that caused most of the problem. So all British blood is not going to cause problems but if you need blood when here you can always ask if the donor was vegetarian. Although that is irrelevant to your chance of being infected by a tick that will cause you to have anaphylactic reactions to meat.
"I know lots of people would like to eat organically grown/farmed high welfare gmo free food, however we can't produce enough that way to feel the population.Somethings gotta give."
"Abso!ute!y no kidding, I was in a restaurant in France last year when an Englishman rejected his steak tartare because it was raw. He asked them to take it away and cook it. I can't imagine how it turned out."
"Just in case I now have you worried about needing blood when you are in the UK. - according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) there have been only four cases globally of infection by blood transfusion. Over-reaction to ban anyone from donating if they have been in the UK, whether they are omnivore or meat eater, vegetarian or vegan - judge for yourself in the light of those figures."
"I'm not sure the OP was worried about needing blood. I can't personally donate blood due to having spent 6 months in the UK in the early 90s. Out of curiosity, I checked France when the terror attacks happened, and there you can donate unless you were in the UK for over a year.Presumably if it were still a risk, the Red Cross would have extended the time frame which excludes you from donating blood. As that time frame ended in 1996 (for both the American and French Red Cross), I wouldn't be concerned now."
I lived in Britain and ate beef from 1980 to 1996 (and still do) and have been donating blood every 8 weeks until recently. Everybody seemed happy with that.
"You couldn't have in the US though. I guess it would be hard for the UK to ban everyone from the UK from donating blood. There are shorter time frames for other European countries. I think France only mentioned the UK.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/…arc5So for the OP coming from the US, he would only know about the US rules. I didn't know they were different until I thought about looking up the rules in France."
