"So, a little while ago, new guidelines announced. I think they still don't go far enough but inch by inch.....thank God for Dr. Fauci, he is our only hope.Here's the gist of it:""......all Americans including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible; avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people; avoid discretionary travel; and avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants and public food courts...."""
"Mahalo, Akamai NIck. I hope that Hawaii-bound tourists will PLEASE heed the directive about discretionary travel and postpone their trips here. This is no time o be ""vacationing"" in a place with limited health care and a supply chain that necessitates everything being shipped in. Seeing tourists hoarding TP at Costco has got a lot of residents on edge!"
