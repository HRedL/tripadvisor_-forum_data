"Me (14, female) and my older sister (21, female) are planning on going on a trip to Venice Beach in early/mid 2021 (probably late May-early June). How safe is this location for 2 younger women like us? I would never want anything bad to happen on our trip as our parents will not be attending with us (we live in Colorado). Are there a lot of problems with things like drugging, theft, or other incidents like that? Thank you!"
"There is an HI Hostel in Santa Monica that might be a good option for you both- nice location. They have some private rooms. You'll want to book way ahead to get those though.(Venice Beach is not where I would want my 14 year old to stay.)Edited: 8:28 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"There are lots of drugs in Venice along with homelessness. It is way worse due to SARS-COV-2.It's a crazy piece of the world that some can appreciate during normal times.Edited: 9:29 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"What's your purpose for visiting Venice Beach? It's OK during the day time. I assume you won't be going out drinking in the evenings, so day time visits should be OK. I would not stay in Venice Beach though."
"I presume they just want to stay there because they think it will be ""fun"" or ""hip"". Don't do it. There is really no reason to stay there, either, there are plenty of other places to stay."
"How 'street smart' are you? If a good-looking young man with his arm in a sling asked you to help him load something into his car, would you help? If you were chatting with some friendly people at a coffee shop, and they offered to show you both around town in their car, would you go? Would your sister go out on a date if someone asked her? Those are, sadly, all very dangerous things to do. (These aren't necessarily common occurrences, but they are frequently how predators snare their victims.)I agree with the others, stay elsewhere and maybe visit Venice for the day.Edited: 4:13 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"New TA member, first post. Wildly ridiculous situation. Why would the 14 year old be asking? What 14 year old would use the phrase “our parents will not be attending with us?” Bogus is spelled B O G U S. This has been happening a lot on this forum lately. Maybe a lot of kids are very, very bored."
Also be aware that this situation (young woman traveling with a slightly older woman) raises alarm bells for human trafficking. An alert airline employee will flag that one.
"Look at towns like Hermosa Beach, etc. instead. Its on west side too."
