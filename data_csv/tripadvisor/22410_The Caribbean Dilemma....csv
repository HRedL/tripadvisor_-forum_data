"UNREAL write up! Thank you for sharing. So many thoughts to take away from this article, but the one I feel most strongly about is the idea that islands can use the pandemic as a chance to pave a new path for their tourism business. Having visited the ABC islands for decades, including nearly annual visits to Aruba since 1991, the damage done to the environment is not subtle. Having visited the island recently after near zero tourism for 5 months, you can see how fast Mother Nature wants to return these islands to their previous natural splendors. Hopefully the local authorities plan their ""new normal"" in a way that accounts for an environmental recovery, even if the economic recovery does not take numbers back to previous highs."
"Wonderful!!! How do you feel about the long-term visa, like Barbados is doing, for people who can work remotely? I see that as a big win for the island - someone lives on the island, draws income from the home country, and spends the money on the island. It allows for more normal-income people to spend long periods of time on the island. And rather than staying in a resort or high rise, they would probably rent an apartment or small house and wander locally, rather than do tourist stuff."
