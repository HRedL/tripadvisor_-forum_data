"We had a trip booked next week to goFrom USA to Munich to Naples(spend a week in Amalfi Coast)Naples to Palermo(one week there)Palermo to Valletta, Malta Trip is non refundable flights and hotels. But, given the unfortunate Corona Virus situation in Italy, we want to skip Italy completely and instead do:USA to Munich(Costly fare. Use it). Then drop Munich to Naples. InsteadFrom Munich go to Seville Seville to Malaga and Malaga to Palermoand continue our planned trip(We will just lose the money for Amalfi coast part this way and still be able to utilize the Sicily and Malta tickets and then use the Malta to Munich to USA tickets also.Though I have Aliianz insurance, they will not cover Epidemic(Corono Virus). First, on above changed plan, any advice would be good.Main questions is:How do I go from Malaga to Palermo the easiest way; without touching any part of mainland Italy(Rome etc).?thanks,Badari"
"Ryanair flies from Madrid to Palermo.I'm not at all sure that you really need to upset your travel plans so significantly, based on the current situation."
"Malaga [our favorite restaurant La Bahia] to Palermo you have a real problem--Iberia with 2 stops taking 17 hours.You would need to fly from Munich to Sevilla non stop on Luftansa, then a 2 hour train ride to Malaga [or skip it]. Sevilla to Palermo it’s Vueling or Ryanair, 2 non stops per week; one-stops daily.See skyscanner.comEdited: 9:28 pm, February 24, 2020 "
Just to mention that Sicily is a region of Italy and defences against COVID-19 are confined to Northern Italy.https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…
"North Carolina has had 40 deaths from flu this winter, thats more than all of Europe from coronavirus.. There has been no case of corona virus south of Rome, (and only 1 in Rome) It seems a shame to change your holiday and miss out on Amalfi and the rest for such an insignificant threat. HOwever, you can fly direct Malaga to Palermo with Ryanair on Sunday, Monday Weds and Friday.Edited: 1:31 am, February 25, 2020 "
Thanks.
Ironically a first case of coronavirus has been registered in Palermo: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.corriere.it…
"People come and go in Europe: why do you think you will be safer in Palermo rather than in another Italian city?Things are changing very fast as well: the UK government this morning recommended to British tourists to self-quarantine if they were coming from places north of Pisa-Florence-Rimini and a couple of hours later the first cases of Coronavirus in Florence and Rimini were announced.If you are worried about catching the virus you should lock yourself inside your home in my opinion.Edited: 7:20 am, February 25, 2020 "
