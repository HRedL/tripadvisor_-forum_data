Anyone down there hear about Mark Zuckerberg's(of Facebook fame) sister Randi's plane ride from LA to MZT harrassment issue ? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017…
I heard about it but didn't realize her destination was Mazatlan!
Here is a quoted article from CNBCmazmessenger.com/2017/…
"Randi Zuckerberg was here in Mazatlan as a keynote speaker at a 2-day conference. Noroeste broadcast a portion of it live on Facebook! :-) Hopefully, she got to enjoy a bit of our local hospitality and great weather while she was here and that they treated her really well on her return flight."
