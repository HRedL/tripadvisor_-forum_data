"With all these posts on the Corona Virus, I thought we need a Resort Fee post. I haven't seen one recently. So here is the question, with a drop in demand, will resort fees start to decrease?"
"Don't see resort fees decreasing, but do see reduced advertised rates and other incentives once things cool down."
"I am not sure resort fees will drop but is really nice to have another fee thread, thankyou..."
They'll drop room rates ( they've already done this in many instances) before RFs. I can see them offering promotions that waive resort fees if/ when the demand continues to sink.
My money is on them instituting a Corona Virus Cleaning Fee...
"I agree that rates are and will continue to go down. They will try and keep the resort fees constant.But at some point, if it lasts long enough, you may see a hotel flinch. I expect they will waive fees before they lower them."
Coronavirus free resort fee might start. $72 plus taxes feels right.
A $19 Resort Fee would probably be appropriate considering current events.

If I worked for MGM and read this thread.I would reduce the hotel rates and introduce a deep hotel cleaning fee.
"They have yet to say anything about resort fees, but MGM Resorts just announced no parking fees!"
"I think that Resort Fees will soon include masks and gloves.The high-end resorts, will include logo bunny suits, and full face shields, with the resort’s logo in a hologram.Just a prediction.Hunt"
"Just like having a temporary ban on smoking, I can see resort fees waived temporarily until things get back to normal in 2021."
With only 50% of the strip and downtown casinos reopening before spring of 2021 it will be interesting to see if the open ones can draw in enough business.
Cosmopolitan has announced resort fee is going up to $45 in 2021!
"Treasure Island is accepting reservation for after May 26. Quoting resort fee of $39, then tax on resort fee of another $5.22."
It might decrease substantially to get people to come back.
Speaking of coming back...what happened to the OP of this thread?
"""Speaking of coming back...what happened to the OP of this thread?""Silly person. He is on vacation."
"Resort Fee thread! Yay. How about kids in Vegas? That one has really subsided after willie d left the forum. he was great, I loved bantering with him. lol"
I think MGM will go bust too And if they don't they will offload most of their properties and perhaps keep one of possibly two at most It can't happen soon enough
I agree John. Fire sale over at Mirage.
"All rooms should be free. Then tack on the resort fee, entertainment fee, cocktail fee, cleaning fee, security fee and comp fee"
resorts fees will stay.it is a way that nobody gets a free comped room
it is a way that nobody gets a free comped room - It might not be a free comped room up front but I'm sure there will be plenty who have gambled enough get any resort fees waived at check out.My understanding was that RFs were introduced to reduce the commission paid to the 3rd party booking sites like Expedia who only earn commission on the room rate.
"I think Las Vegas is the most appropriate place for resort fees, if there is such as a place at all. This whole idea of calculating how much your room actually cost through a round about calculation serves as a test to the math ability of the guests. If they cannot figure it out easily, they should be the most sought after guests on the casino floors. For one thing, they probably cannot count cards either.Edited: 7:10 am, May 22, 2020 "
Any place i've checked are still charging the same resort fees.
FYI - Sahara hotel waiving resort fees for up to four nights if booked by midnight May 25th. Some roooms are as low as $54 per night.
"MGM will not go bust...they already are. But, the Chinese will gladly loan them so more money."
placebets. I think you meant Dubai
I asked and the hotel dropped all of our resort fees. It doesn’t hurt to ask! We are going the end of June 2020.
They actaully gone up. Vegas are thief
"Heres an idea. Lets drastically reduce the services and amenities we offer our hotel guests, blame it all on Covid19 yet keep the resort fees that we charged for things we will no longer provide..."
"I think the only thing going down is the parking fee at some resorts where they stopped adding that on. Resort fees they claim also are for maid service and such, so don't expect those ""Resort Fees"" to ever change..."
“ Resort fees they claim also are for maid service and such”Nope.
"Resort fees obviously do not include cleaning your room if you are there for multible nights, your on own.."
"Maid Service - Depends on the place you are staying at OYO for example and other places do include Housekeeping as part of their Resort Fees:(https:/…las-vegas-resort-fees.html)Again, every place is different and includes different things, just depends on where you are staying..."
