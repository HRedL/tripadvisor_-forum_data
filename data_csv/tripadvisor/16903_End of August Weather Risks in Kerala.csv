"Hi there,I just wondered if anyone could give me tips on whether or not the end of August is a really bad time to go to Kerala due to Monsoon season. I am travelling and was hoping to get to Southern India at the end of August. Is this a really bad decision or could I still have a relatively good time there weather wise?! I need to be in Goa on 4th September and I really wanted to do Kerala first as I am coming in from Nepal.....Thank you for your helpHeidiheidi.budino@gmail.com"
Hi Normally end of august would be idle time to visit kerala infact tourist season starts from sepember. This year monsoon is not heavy in kerala it used to be..i recomend to stick on with the same dates
"I would advise you to note the epidemics that are doing round in Kerala. Most of these epidemics are around Kottayam, but better to take precautions whilst travelling. Any idea as to what places you will be visiting whilst in Kerala?"
As suggested by the other member. August is really the ideal time. The monsoon sets in by June and goes on till July. August it would be pleasant with ocassional showers. The entire Kerala is beautiful after rains. With greenary etc. So stick to your plans.There is no epidemic now as they have contained it.Regards.. SA
