Don't think we will be going this year! https:/…
I’m not sure if you’re reading something I’m not? Was there a suggestion that it’ll remain closed until the end of the year?
"Exactly Hyru. Some read too much into the here and now without remaining optimistic about tomorrow. Everything is in a state of flux. Further announcements by both the Cuban government AND the Canadian government are sure to come in due course. My money is still on September for reboot. Will the 14 day quarantine still be necessary for the Cuban mainland both arriving and returning?? Those details have yet to be divulged as well. But like the month of September, my money is on a lifting of that necessity as part of reopening for business. Never the less, I'm not targeting a return to Cuba until November, so I have some wiggle-room on much more prompt expectations.Terry"
I think (hope?) September is a good bet also. Surely Cuba is looking at their Jamaican neighbors who are open for business and haven’t seen a significant increase in cases the last couple months.
"The only thing we know right now is that Cuba will not open until Habana is in phase 3. Right now, Habana is far from being there. And Artemisa is far from complying with their phase 3 requirements. They have put Bauta in phase 1, opened an even in Mariel... What we also know is that not tourist will have to spend a 14 days quarantine once in Cuba. Either the borders are open and everyone go free (under the supervision of the medical team of the hotel or neighbourhood if they are in a casa) either the borders are closed and only residents can enter and have to undergo a 14 days quarantine.My opinion is that the borders will not open at the beginning of September."
Sept is 3 weeks away .Are you serious ?.Not gonna happen . Johnny C
Schools will open. Cases will surge. Restrictions will be reinstated.
"Well no one is covering the virus with travel insurance. Also if the Canadian government says you have to come home because there is a resurgence, airlines will not cover your cost home."
Thanks for the link. I read the link twice. Seems like common sense.
@buddies .. there are a couple offering covid coverage. The odd one always did depending when it was purchased but some now advertising it ... there has been a couple news articles.
"According to the Canadian Life and Health insurance Association director, now that covid is a known issue it will not be in the coverage on policies going forward. If your flight is cancelled due to pandemic or you contract it while abroad, none of these costs would be covered. If you are told to return to Canada by the government of Canada because the travel advisory level has been raised, it could result in additional costs to you. If you are travelling for recreation you probably won’t find any insurance that you could purchase."
@4 @5 Ditto September 1 is fantasy land.

"@buddies ... is that a recent statement? (Saw something similar on their page but it dates back to March). Nonetheless, there are a couple providers covering covid. Of course it’s a rapidly changing environment so always worth keeping up to date on it if you plan to purchase. I know some airlines, like TUI and someResorts like Grand Palladium have mentioned offering it too. As examples.Edited: 11:36 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"LASAddict yes it was put out on CTV about 2 weeks ago.Edited: 11:46 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"@buddies ... interesting as the 2-3 covering covid just announced it recently. Some of the other major players said they’d offer it once the travel advisory was lifted. I couldn’t find that direct statement on CLHIA’s website.Edited: 11:55 pm, August 06, 2020 "
@buddies .. can you paste the article? Thanks
Lol and by paste I mean post the link :)
Just for ref.... as this isn't a Canadian only forum... there are numerous option for COVID valid travel insurance available in the UK. Many tour operators now offer COVID cover with their insurance.I actually bought a COVID valid policy away back in April when I thought travel might open up sooner... bit of a waste but they did add 3 free months :)
@Gordon I’ve definitely heard about UKs options too and referenced one. I’ve tried to dig up this CTV article but can’t seem to find it. In my searches I found some more insurer specific articles re covering covid both now and some only after the advisory is lifted. Who knows ... i look forward to reading the article for more context.
"https://www.medipac.com/Early Bird Travel Insurance® is now available and includes coverage for COVID-19.*Apply NOW save a minimum of 5% up to 23%.COVID-19 Official Statement:We understand that our clients have concerns about medical insurance coverage for COVID-19.The following information is provided to assure you of how Exclusion 29 of the Medipac Policy applies to the Government of Canada Travel Advisory.The Government of Canada has issued a travel advisory for non-essential travel to all countries due to COVID-19. During the duration of this COVID-19 advisory, Medipac WILL NOT apply Exclusion 29 in the adjudication of claims; i.e. coverage for COVID-19 will be provided.Where the government warns against all travel (for any reason, including COVID-19) Exclusion 29 will apply. For example, travel on a cruise will not be covered as the government warns against all cruise ship travel.Pre-existing condition clauses and other policy terms and conditions will continue to apply."
Things aren’t going in the right direction with the virus for Cuba to allow a whole load of international travellers back in three weeks time in my opinion
"Since we all have time on our hands, here's a study conducted on the transmission of c19 on airplanes with and without the middle seat being occupied:https:/…2020.07.02.20143826v3We use recent data and research results to approximate the probability that an air traveler in coach will contract Covid-19 on a US domestic flight two hours long, both when all coach seats are full and when all but middle seats are full. The point estimates we reach based on data from late June 2020 are 1 in 4,300 for full flights and 1 in 7,700 when middle seats are kept empty."
LASAddict it was on the CTV facebook page. I took a photo of it and posted it on the Los Cactus facebook page when it came out but would have to go back two weeks on the CTV page and there are a lot of articles that they posted since then. Can’t post photos on here so you will have to scroll back to find it.
@buddies .. thanks! No big deal just was curious as it goes against what the actual suppliers themselves have been saying.
"Thanks H. I only read peer-reviewed articles;)So, the risk is almost double with the middle seat occupied. Substantial indeed. Note last sentence, also interesting,These death-risk levels are considerably higher than those associated with plane crashes but comparable to those arising from two hours of everyday activities during the pandemic."
https:/…Re air canada resuming flights.
Oceanblue:It was posted yesterday on this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147…
Thanks!
It says you will be sent to a hospital for treatment. I am going to assume that the Cuban govt isn’t going to pay for treatment for tourists. Does anyone have any info to the contrary? Would not want to be put up in a quarantine unit in Cuba for any amount of time.
"Not to offend anyone but if us Canadians (me) do our part and contain as much as possible, they should let us travel there. We (CDN) provide a ton of input in travel to them. As long as we are serious keeping it flat. Everyone should keep everyone safe. U.S. is another major problem. I want to travel .... safely.Edited: 11:52 pm, August 17, 2020 "
