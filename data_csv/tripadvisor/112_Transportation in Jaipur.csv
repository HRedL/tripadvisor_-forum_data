"Hi all,My friends and I have plan to visit India in next week. We're still discussing about transportation in Jaipur. We will be land by plane on 21 Mar 2020 around 6/7pm. We'll be staying in Tuk Tuk Hostel, if there's no change. We just have full day 22 Mar 2020 to explore Jaipur.So far our itineraries are:1. Nahargarh Fort (Sunrise)2. Amber Palace3. Amber Fort4. Stepwell*5. Jal Mahal6. Hawa Mahal7. City Palace (sightseeing)8. Jantar Mantar9. Albert Hall (Sunset)10. Sun Temple (Sunset)* *optionalHowever, I am looking at this option https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProducâ€¦ somehow it is just not enough, most of packages starts from 8am, to get sunrise at least 5am should start to Nahagarh Fort.We hope it won't exceed 1500Rs for transportation, since any admission will be paid by us and it's around 500Rs per person.Our train will be 2am on 23 Mar 2020. Any help/ideas are welcome."
Tuk tuk is good option.and if you hire car then book one day before you have a list many monument so do fastThanksRuralindiavacations
