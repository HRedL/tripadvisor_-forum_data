We are looking for a very nice place on the beach
"Sorry, it would help a lot if you give as a bit more informatione about time, season, how many person.And please and thank you would make it easier to answer."
"The Hotel del Coronado, of course, when it opens.https://hoteldel.com/coronavirus/"
"There are very few places to stay ""on the beach"" in San Diego and most are very expensive.Knowing your nightly budget, who is coming (aprx ages) and when would all be helpful."
How much are you wanting to spend and what time of year?
IThe Del is on the beach and us going through a remodel and will be shiney and new. Doesn't get better than that. I believe it's a give star property. Four star for sure
"Just FYI for anyone looking at the Del now: ""We are currently accepting reservations for stays at Beach Village at The Del beginning June 26, 2020, and for stays at Hotel del Coronado beginning July 19, 2020.""They had some delays in construction earlier on the pandemic and they are not planning to reopen the main hotel until they've completed work on the pool area."
