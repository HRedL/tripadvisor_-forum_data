Hi. My husband and I are due to arrive in Funchal on Friday 24th July and will be staying at Pestana Carlton. I’m looking forward to it but must admit also a bit nervous. I am aware everyone is tested when they arrive and I have filled in the questionnaire online. Would someone be able to explain the arrival process for me? Do we have to go straight to our hotel room and wait there until we get a negative result? We arrive at lunchtime so does that mean we won’t be able to go out to eat or buy food until the following day? Also what happens if one of us happened to test positive? Would we then be separated? Thanks.
Here's the official video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEKT2SfnXjM
"What that video doesn't tell you is what happens if one or both of you prove positive for Covid-19 after the airport test. As I understand it, health officials will be in contact and both of you may be taken to a government approved quarantine resort/hotel. I doubt that you will be separated because if one of you proves positive then the other person has been in very close contact and is a potential riskAs regards the up to 12 hours in the Pestana Carlton waiting for your results, I believe you can leave your room and use the hotel's bar and food facilities but you should not leave the hotel for shopping or other purposes.If anyone knows any different perhaps they will post here."
"The testing process has been put in place since the 1st of July and we have had dozens of international flights since then and everything seems to be going smoothly up to the moment. When you get to the airport there is a blue line (if you don´t have a test) and a green line (if tou have a test). There are some ""stweardesses"" that can guide you through the process if you need help.There is no quarantine in place while waiting for the test result, but people are asked to self isolate as possible while waiting for the result. You can still buy food obviously. The point of the test is if by chance your test is positive the authorities can trace the people who have had direct contact with yourself for more than just a few minutes. Hopefully in a 12h span it won´t be that many people.Regarding the case where one of you is positive for sure the other one will be asked to self isolate aswell since it is highly likely he will be infected too. I am pretty sure authorities will not ask couples to be kept apart against their will. While there were only domestic flights we have had cases of families with children where one was positive and they are were not split.Edited: 6:23 am, July 16, 2020 "
Does anyone know which hotel you are moved to if you test positive please? We are flying out on 3rd August and just wqnt to know all options before we travel. Thanks
Thank you so much for all your replies. I feel a bit more relaxed now.
Catherine may i ask what you are more relaxed about now? Just had confirmation today our Sept holiday with Tui has now been cancelled.That is a big relief to my wife & myself.Not the end of the world in the whole scheme of things & looking forward to 2021 visiting Madeirarob
We were booked to go to Madeira in September for my husband’s 70th birthday staying at the Pestana Grand We cancelled ourselves losing our deposit-I can’t imagine going on holiday and having a COVID test at the airport and then having to self isolate and also self isolate on our return - to me that’s just hassle and holidays are supposed to be hassle free I’m so glad we decided to cancel - the hotel isn’t even open yet. Hoping we might get there for Christmas Be interested to read how people going soon find the whole experience
"Re post # 7, just for information: the Pestana Grand is taking bookings from 5 August."
"I think my biggest fear was one of us testing positive and being separated - I’d sort of got that impression from reading something, can’t remember where though. You read a lot about people having covid without having any symptoms, therefore having no idea they are carrying the virus."
"That is good to know we can at least go out and get some food as I was unsure of that and wondered what we would do. We will just go to a supermarket and get a couple of bottles of wine and bits to eat, 12 hours is not long and we have a nice accommodation so will make the most of it until we hopefully get the all clear."
"Barbara: I'm not so sure it is the case that you can leave your accommodation to buy wine and food as said in post # 3. This is the official information from the Government of the Autonomous Region of Madeira as given in English on the official Visit Madeira website:""After performing the PCR test, passengers will proceed to their destination, where they must wait for the result, IN CONFINEMENT, and will be informed of the result within an estimated period of 12 hours.""Much as I said in my post #2.Edited: 4:10 pm, July 18, 2020 "
"Hi I was responding to post #3 from that I assume it means they do not expect you to arrive and not be able to eat or drink anything for up to 12 hours after you arrive? Maybe I have read it wrong but that was my take on it. “ There is no quarantine in place while waiting for the test result, but people are asked to self isolate as possible while waiting for the result. You can still buy food obviously. The point of the test is if by chance your test is positive the authorities can trace the people who have had direct contact with yourself for more than just a few minutes. Hopefully in a 12h span it won´t be that many people”"
Barbara: The point of my post was that what was said in post # 3 does not match what the Govt rules say so post # 3 cannot be taken as fact! I have given the facts.
"Ion, i would be surprised however that they expect you to arrive and have nothing to eat or drink for up to 12 hours after a long day at the airport and flying. I have emailed the embassy for clarification so will hopefully get a definitive answer to this from the horses moth so to speak."
"Barbara ..Just pack a sandwich snacks and anything else into your suitcase and follow the guidelines .It's not right trying to guess expectations. It's so easy to pack sandwiches, snacks and whatever.Play the game.Enjoy your holiday."
If you are staying in a hotel there will be food and drink on site so there's no need to leave the building.
We are staying in a villa so not applicable unfortunately!
"In actual fact, the question is not really what the rules say or someone's opinion about what you can do while waiting for the airport test results, it's to do with ""how can the rules be enforced?""I don't think they can be. You arrive, get tested and then while making your way eventually to your accommodation you can do what you like - go to a restaurant, shop in a super or mini market, whatever."
I agree with you but tend to stay in what the rules are if at all possible as only fair when a guest in someone else’s country and even at home as would not want to be responsible for passing it to a vulnerable person. Either way we will of course ensure we can eat and drink just at the villa not out until we get the results.
"Anyone seen that on the Daily Mail app.Mainly elderly people,wearing masks in blistering heat queuing up for sunloungers/parasols on Benidorm beach.Taking over a hour to get one.UnbelievableRob"
"#13 I am trying to give the best advice as I can. I understand that given the circumstances there will need to be a lot of common sense since the rules cannot predict every single scenario.For instance, I know that if I travel to Madeira to UK right now I will have to self isolate for 14 days. I tried to look for further official information and it states that I can take a public transport from the airport to my accomodation if I don't have alternative. It doesn't say nothing regarding food and basic ammenities, so I suspect that if I travel to UK right now I won't be able to buy a bottle of milk, some cookies or tooth brush and toilet paper, or whatever I need for the following 14 days. If I don't have anyone that can provide those ammenities to me so I can, based on the official government information, assume that I won't be able to buy any of those for 14 days."
"fnc_paulo: With regard to quarantine for 14 days after arrival in the Uk you are alllowed out to buy essential items if there is no one else who can do that for you.Edited: 8:27 am, July 19, 2020 "
"There has also been talk of a test at Heathrow if your happy to pay for it to avoid quarantine all being well of course. This will be my choice if it is happening despite the high cost.Edited: 7:42 am, July 20, 2020 "
When are you going Barbara?Would be interested to hear how all this testing malarky goes.
"We fly all being well on Sunday 09.10, I think someone has posted it already but yes if you know that would be very helpful thank you."
"I case anyone has plans to enjoy all the wonderful things Madeira has to offer in the coming weeks, this needs to be filled in before you go or the airline won’t let you fly. https://madeirasafe.com/#/login"
"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/air-bridg…The UK press is suggesting that Portugal will lose the requirement to isolate for 14 days coming back to UK shortly so this will make travel much easier. I am particularly interested to know so how many passengers on a plane will be asked to isolate if one on the plane tests positive on arrival in Funchal here in Jersey it is only the people that are sitting around the individual that are asked to isolate not the whole plane so any experience at all would be extremely useful as arriving with a negative test but having to isolate because a person you are sitting next to has tested positive on arrival would be particularly annoying.Edited: 4:20 am, July 24, 2020 "
"The protocol does not foresee that a whole plane is put in quarantine because of an infected passenger. If a passenger is infected, the health authority determines the degree of exposure of each of the remaining passengers, usually they are the passengers sitting right next (on the side and front and rear rows). These contacts are considered to be on ""active surveillance"" which is somewhat less restrictive than quarantine. This means they are contacted periodically to self-monitor any symptoms and advised to adopt social restriction measures. Madeira is ""open"" for international travel since the 1st of July, and 21'000 passengers disembarked in Madeira Airport since then of which 9 had a positive test. Following BA, today we have the 1st easyJet flight from Gatwick.Edited: 5:25 am, July 24, 2020 "
"#28 thank you for that, it helps show just how little a risk it is and will maybe help some of those who are nervous hopefully to see that the risk is very small indeed."
We are now sitting on our balcony waiting for the test results. The whole journey was very straightforward. The testing process at Funchal airport was extremely quick and efficient. They even give you a banana and bottle of water! When we arrived at our hotel our room was ready for us. We’ve been told we have to stay in our room until we get the test results. Hopefully we get them by dinner time!
Catherine that’s great to know and thank you for the update. We fly Sunday morning so reassuring to know it is as straight forward as we thought. I will keep everything crossed for you that you get your results quickly and they are negative. Enjoy your holiday and beautiful Madeira.
Thanks Barbara. Safe journey to you on Sunday. After filling in the online registration form I took a screenshot of the QR code. I just had to show that and we seemed to bypass a lot of people and went straight to the testing. Not sure if they hadn’t filled the form in beforehand or what.
"Oh thanks for that Catharine, weave filled it in but never occurred to me to to take a screen shot of the code so will do that right now. Let us know when you get your results if you get a minute take care"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53528490Rob
"Thanks for the info on procedures at the airport Catherine.The more information that is available, the easier it will be to make an informed decision."
Results took about 9 hours to come through. Both were negative. We were pretty sure we didn’t have anything but it’s still a relief when you get the result after all the reports of people having the virus with no symptoms. We ended up having something to eat in our room using room service but went out for a walk after the results came through. It is very very quiet. But we can now relax and enjoy the holiday. Really glad we came!
"Great result, enjoy rest of your holiday. Might be a bit busier tomorrow daytime and certainly warmer than here , it's raining in West Scotland ...Enjoy"
"Brilliant enjoy your holiday I’m sure the lovely weather, warm welcome and cheaper prices will make the little inconvenience worth it."
"Hi Catherine, thanks for the update and enjoy your holiday. We are due out on 17 August so helpful to have reassurance it can be navigated. Out of interest just wondered whether you flew Easyjet and how full the flight was?"
"Yes, we flew with EasyJet. The flight looked pretty full to me. I only noticed the odd empty seat."
"Good news on the test result, Catherine.You can now enjoy your holiday with that hurdle out of the way.On your flight, did you have someone sat on the third seat next to you?It does seem to make a mockery of all these 'social distancing' rules.I see that the UK government, in their infinite wisdom, have not agreed an air corridor with Portugal (death rate 1700) with the UK (death rate 45000+) Incredible. So it seems that you will have to fill in a bit of paper saying that you will isolate on your return. Our country is going mad, I think.Edited: 4:45 am, July 25, 2020 "
"HO: If you've been reading other threads and posts there is a theory going around that regional airbridges may be introduced as soon as Monday covering Madeira, the Algarve and The Azores. We'll wait and see."
Does anyone know whether the requirement to be tested at the airport stops if there’s an air bridge between UK and Maderia?
"Travelbear44 I think that if there is an air bridge between the UK and Madeira , you will not need to go into quarantine on your return to the UK but you would still need to be tested on arrival at Funchal Airport on your outward journey.If I have misunderstood the situation , I shall be happy to be corrected."
"The testing requirement at Madeira Airport is not dependent on air bridges. To Madeirean authorithies it does not matter where the passenger arrives from, whether he is a local, mainland portuguese, german, british, etc. Same rules apply to everyone, no ""air corridor"" scheme. The only people who are not subject to test are the ones travelling from/to Porto Santo. Anyone arriving to Porto Santo from everywhere else needs a test anyway."
"Thanks Jamieboy, my original thoughts were the same as yours but it’s all so confusing at the moment it’s hard to keep up!"
"Catherine: Were refreshments available on your Easyjet fight - eg, coffee, drinks, snacks, food?"
There was a limited service. Cold drinks and snacks were available but no hot drinks. I don’t know about hot food but I didn’t see anyone with anything like that.
"Thanks, Catherine. In fact since posting I went into the Easyjet website in some depth. It's cold drinks only (eg, Coke, lemonade, beer, wine) and just a very limited array of cold snacks.But it does say you can bring your own food and non-alcoholic drinks on board. My partner is Type 1 diabetic and as it's a very early flight she needs to eat something substantial for breakfast."
There’s lots of places open to get food and drink in the airport once you’ve gone through security to take on board with you. We just got the standard meal deal in Boots but lots of people were walking round with Pret bags.
"Post 42 - Yes BF, I have been reading other threads - in fact I posted information on the possibility of regional air bridges.However, according to this morning's news, that prospect has now gone, for the moment. No air bridge with Portugal or any part of it.Very strange decision, considering the death and infection rates in some of the countries that the UK does have air bridges with.Much like the decision that face masks are needed in shops, just as we appear to be getting on top of the virus.Barmy and illogical."
"Than, you Catherine again for the info that is really helpful as we will need to buy stuff in in case we can’t go out even for food as in a villa."
H0..This is one of the main reasons why Boris wants people to wear masks.A week ago Spain was promoting holidays & saying how good things are.Basically he wants to stop the second wave of Covid19https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53540691Rob
Relevance to Madeira ?
It can happen anywhere?People have a false sense of security.One day Portugal is “ out “ next “ in “. I like Madeiras handling of the situation but things can soon change.
My post # 54 was in reply to H0s last paragraph in his post#52.Covid19 has no relevance whatsoever to Madeira...
"Well we are here safe and sound enjoying a glass of wine on the terrace. Flight was good and very straight forward. BA game everyone a bag with water, crisps and biscuits in for free. Only downside was I have left my phone in the lounge on charge so will have to collect on 3rd. Test was very quick but not p,das ant I would have to say but all done and out to our waiting taxi in 20 minutes from landing. The guy we rented the villa from was very kind and said if we gave him a list he would get stuff in for us. So 4 bottles of red, water, French stick salami and cheese will keep us going until we get our results. Feeling very chilled and looking forward to getting results so we can get out and about."
Good to hear that all is well.Just imagining having a glass of wine on the terrace!!Enjoy the break.
"Sounds fantastic Barbara. Glad all is well, hope you receive your test results soon. Enjoy."
Glad all went well Barbara. Hope you enjoy your holiday.
We are all clear guys so our holiday starts now.
"Great News , and all before the Red Wine ran oot lol . Enjoy your holiday Barbara. .."
Good news Barbara. Have a great holiday.
"Thank you Catharine I’m sure we will, hope your enjoying your time as well. So happy to be here and the little I convenience was well worth it."
Hi Barbara did they give you any sense how many they would quarantine if one on the whole flight rested positive? In Jersey it is a few rows near the positive person but on other routes it is the whole plane. Any information would be super.
"Post # 66. You have already asked the question at your post # 27 and got the answer at post # 28. I very much doubt that Barbara can add anything meaningful because when you arrive you are very much in your own ""bubble"" (passport control, baggage reclaim, keen to get to your accommodation, etc) and enquiring about the broader picture would not be on your mind."
"Barbara - I am pleased to hear your good news. Have a lovely holiday.Bucksfizz, I quite agree with you; enquiring about the broader picture merely 'muddies the waters' so to speak."
Post#66Sorry they did not say anything about it and in fact they did not tell us to self isolate at all it is only because we knew we had to do it.
"Thank you Jamie, we just stocked up on provisions and are now chilling on the terrace before we head out for a walk and lunch. It’s a hard life lol It seems quite quiet here but that suits us, many places are open but not everywhere and as we like to sit outside other than to go to the loo or groceries no mask needed which is great."
Barbara thank you for taking the time to respond. Enjoy your holiday.
Bucks fizz Barbara kindly took the time to answer. Relevant up to date information is important as things are changing hour by hour.
"Hopetoretiresoon: Barbara did take the time to answer but did not add to the fount of information, as I predicted in my post. Secondly, the tourism situation may be changing hour by hour in Britain but not in Madeira!Edited: 7:59 am, July 27, 2020 "
"BF I only answered direct questions out of politeness , if not relevant to you then Please ignore."
Thanks for keeping us updated Barbara. Enjoy the rest of your stay.
Bf you sent a private message to say you will reply to any message you choose Too which I’s fine Of course but why not post that here and I never said you couldn’t do so so I sure what the problem is.
Post 75 thank you we will Rey for sure. .

Should say pleasure guys sorry!
"#73 the situation in U.K. is irrelevant as it wS expected we had to quarantine on return and not changed so not sure what the difference is? Or why what is happening in Spain etc matters, Enjoy everyone it is worth the effort"
"Hi Barbara, If your unable to socially distance in the street, are you required to wear a mask? If walking from the lido to Funchal or along the coast to Camara de Lobos have you noticed people wearing masks? Thanks."
You do not need to wear a mask outside
I believe I read today that masks will be compulsory outside for tomorrow .... can someone clarify please
If you read the easyjet post below you will see answer. Yes I believe
"Update on masks, from 1 August they must be worn in the streets."
My understanding from our hotel is that though reported in this mornings press the mask situation is still unofficial. Likely to be clarified later today but probably will apply from 1 August
Paper masks should be changed every four hours or sooner if damp. There is so much potential for spreading the virus with careless use.In a hot climate such as Madeira they will need frequent changing and careful disposal.

Could somebody translate post # 92 into readable and sensible English?
Buck still having a tantrum are we?
For the picky ones I will repost my earlier one as auto correct has clearly gone mad.. we are paying lip service to masks as no choice and although we brought quite a few masks we did not bring so many as to replace every 4 hours and are not so concerned that we would even consider doing so. The goal posts have moved so from 1st we need to wear them outside but not the end of the world but not what I would choose. So we will stay local for the last two days and wear to get to the restaurant or bar then remove them as will be sitting outside.
No people will not change them regularly but from what I saw today a lot of people are basically unhygienic.Lack of mask etiquette will cause the spread of the infection which is what was said months ago by Dr Sarah Jarvis and Dr Hilary Jones.As soon as a paper mask is damp it is more of a danger and I was reading that it should be changed four hourly.Useless taking it off and crumpling it in the hands for obvious reasons. Stuffing in bags or pockets the same.
I did wonder Barbara if you were enjoying a few drinks!!!
Thank you for your very informative posts Barbara. The majority of us really appreciate them. It would be great to hear your updates on the new rules around masks. Glad to hear you are having a great time.
I totally agree that Barbara’s post have been very helpfulThere seems to be a bit of a ‘clique’ mentality in certain quarters whereby ‘incomers’ comments aren’t welcome
"Shanied and travebear Thank you, yes it does seem that those who spend their life on here think that others have no right to an opinion. I do however have thick skin so won’t bother me I just think it sad as new people will not post as you risk ridicule. I will however for as long as wanted update those genuinely wanting advice while we are here if I can help. So any questions just ask and I will do my best. Have a great evening guys."
"I sincerely hope you will do that, Babs, and that you will not in future post on the public forum the content of a private message to you. As a community all trying to help each other we expect people to understand that private means private."
"Bucks I am not into games, if you have something to say post it Here don’t do it behind people’s backs. It is a help forum not a secret thing. I am not interested in that so please don’t message in private. If you are happy to say something you should be happy to share not for it to be a secret. Stand by what you say by being open."
"I seem to remember that you thanked me profusely when I gave you some advice privately on how to get the best out of these Forums. Remember that?Nighty, night"
"*As a community all trying to help each other we expect people to understand that private means private.*From what I can gather that private message was trying to put Barbara in her place - hence you not wanting it sharedWe all understand that people may agree to share info via DM at times but if you choose to take to DMs in order to say things that aren’t welcome or appreciated, you have to accept that people can choose to do with them what they like I can’t see how Barbara’s posts have been anything other than extremely helpful to those of us considering travelling in these strangest of timesThere’s absolutely no need for sarcastic comments or sly digs via DM"

"Not mask related, another point referenced by the vice-president today was that very soon travellers who make the PCR test at the origin with a cost will be compensated with a voucher of the same value to be used in the local economy (leisure, social and cultural activities) or via hotel room upgrades/extras of equivalent value.Edited: 6:47 pm, July 28, 2020 "
#105 Travelbear maybe the private message was just so other people wouldn't comment on it or something.. ...Chill Pill everyone . Hopefully mask free at end of November for my hols.
"Bang on, Alex S."
Alex to be honest it was Putting others down so don’t be fooled it could have Been you.
"Great that you are enjoying Madeira again Catherine and Barbara.I'd be grateful for advice on two things :1) Do you know what happens to people who arrive, get tested and are going on to isolate in their own property (NOT hotel or rented villa, etc)? More importantly, what happens if their result comes back positive?2) As you have travelled against FCO advice, I assume you have invalid insurance? Are you comfortable with that?"
Rufford we stayed in self catering and the guy we rented for got us some groceries in. It is not against FCO to go to Madeira or Azores only the mainland. Hope this helps
"More importantly, what happens if their result comes back positive? At VisitMadeira:""4. MonitoringAll passengers will be monitored through an APP (mobile application) ""Madeira Safe to Discover"" of the Regional Health Authority, of voluntary, but recommended use, or by telephone contact.5. Positive test result for COVID-19 diseaseMandatory confinement, if necessary compulsively, for a period of 14 days, in a health establishment, in the respective home or in an accommodation establishment, by decision of the competent health authorities:a) For patients with COVID-19 and those infected with SARS-CoV-2;b) For citizens for whom the health authority or other health professionals have determined active surveillance."" http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/useful-info/corona-virus-(covid-19)/information-to-visitors-(covid-19)"
"Post 113 yes it tells you everything on the Madeira safe website which states that if found to be positive you go to a hotel of their choice and at their expense for 14 days. “Passengers with positive tests, as well as their direct contacts, will be subject to confinement at a designated hotel. All costs (medical, accommodation and meals) will be paid by the Local Government.After 7 days, passengers will be subject to new tests. If negative, visitors can finish their holidays without additional restrictions“"
"Come on Barbera, you asked for restaurant recommendations - which ones did you visit?"
Who are you exactly? I explained where they where on the appropriate section not a different thread. If you want to know the names look it up.
You “ explained” where they were but couldn’t remember their names!After asking for advice and getting a lot of replies you can’t be bothered remembering.Some folk might question whether you are in/ have been in Funchal at all.
"I'm sure there will be a picture of the VILLA ( mmmmmmm) along with local newspaper appearing shortly . I tend to remember all the eating places , its the drinking ones i forget sometimes ."

TB that was my only reason for being here too as see no point being on it if not there or going. I use the site to check hotel reviews and ask the odd question. If you choose to go enjoy but for us it was a relief to get back and not have to wear a mask walking down the street.
"“see no point being on it if not there or going”I do. As a regular visitor to Madeira, I’m happy to “drop by” the TA forum most days to see if I can help with any questions - or to offer restaurant recommendations if anyone’s asking;-)I pick up plenty of useful recs and information here, I like to give a little back where I can.."
Thank you maudsters. I always appreciate help from those who have had experience of where I am thinking about visiting. There are far too many people on TA these days making sarcastic comments to people and just generally being rude. There is no need for it. Nice to see someone being pleasant!
Hi Lucy you can block people if you find them objectioable.If you click on their name and then click on Follow by the side of three dots you can then click block.I have only blocked one person as the language was offensive!.
Thanks tattyff. I didn't know that :)
"tattyff: Maudsters was talking about the open, public Forum. You cannot block people from posting on that, answering questions and giving advice - which is the whole point of the thing."
On the ball BF!Thank you.
+1 to post 141.
I don't want to get into a battle but post 140Not to have to wear a mask walking down the streetHaving just come back shouldn't they be isolating anyway and therefore not walking down the street at all!

Melanie Barbara did post that she was paying for a Covid test on return to the UK so maybe she is clear
"You still need to isolate Test or No Test . UK Government not making the rules up for people to break them . So getting a test soon as you return does not negate the need to isolate , if you do that you are breaking the Rules. Of course some folk know better and are above the law . Unbelievable"
"Beansprout yes she did say she was getting a test but as Alex points out even having a negative test on return still means you have to isolate...Edited: 3:26 pm, August 06, 2020 "
Oops I'm not reading the rules very well thanks for clarification Alex
No bother Beansprout. ..
"No worries Beansprout, there's a lot of info to get your head around and it keeps changing."
It’s a bit worrying if anyone is thinking the rules don’t apply to them or that they can pay their way out of isolating. Aberdeen is reaping the result of people thinking the rules didn’t apply to them and going on a pub crawl.My understanding is that more than one test is required at a space of a few days before anyone can be released from quarantine.I suppose that travelling by BA confers special protection even though it is Spanish owned.
"Kaimhill post # 156: ""even though it [British Airways] is Spanish owned"".Could you please provide the evidence for or source of that statement? I'm not saying you're wrong but when BA and Iberia merged to form IAG [International Airlines Group] BA shareholders got 55% of the shares in IAG and Iberia shareholders got 45%. Since that merger Qatar Airlines has bought 25.1% of IAG and is the largest individual shareholder."
"Why do you ask. IAG is registered in Madrid.Edited: 7:11 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Amazon Europe is registered in Luxembourg but that doesn't mean it's owned by the Luxembourgers. IAG is indeed registered in Madrid but similarly that doesn't mean it's owned by the Spaniards. IAG's operational headquarters are in the UK near Heathrow.So I ask again, on what information do you base your assertion that BA is Spanish owned?"

"Thanks Rob, will try and post some updates once there"
Hi. Our hotel is saying we have to stay in our room until test results but I see elsewhere that requirement is just to stay in hotel not room. What is everyone else’s experience? Thanks.
Stay in room was our information from staff at airport doing testing and hotel reception (porto mare). These are the madeira government rules not hotel rules. Hotel arranged room service.
"Bean sprout yes I am clear although I have still stayed home. Lovely weather and enjoying the garden, BBQ and chilling."
Melanie believe it or not we still had to get home from the airport which requires some walking. Would love to be able to teleport but as far as I am aware Heathrow does not offer that option.
"Landed around 7.45pm, flight probably about half full, masks on apart from when eating and drinking so had a couple of glasses of wine and went to sleep. You need to fill forms in here https://madeirasafe.com/#/login prior to travelling. On arrival if you haven't had a test they scan your QR code from the form you've filled in which is sent to you via text and you are then tested. Test took around a minute and while not enjoyable is just a few seconds of discomfort. Was at hotel an hour after landing. Negative results for myself and my wife arrived by Email at 5.30am.Been out to shops this morning, no issue for me personally wearing a mask when out and I think it will be the norm for a good while yet. Masks needed in indoor areas of hotel but not outside around pools etc.The mild inconvenience is worth it for us to have a nice relaxing week away."
"Hi John , bit of the track here , Not sure what airline you flew with , was it Jet2. ? I seen an Edinburgh - Funchal one yesterday diverted to Manchester, shortly after that a Manchester - Funchal .Did your plane ( if it was jet2 ) have a mix of passengers ? Just wondering if that's what jet2 doing now . Testing process seams doable for me anyway. Great you are sorted , enjoy your holiday. Anyone else know owt about Jet2 yesterday please feel free to help me out . Cheers Alex"
"Thanks for the update John N. Enjoy your holiday.Alex, see the thread Re; Glasgow Funchal. Some info about timings of Jet2 flight there."
Alex - Yesterday's Manchester and Edinburgh passengers were combined on the same aircraft (I assume this was because of low numbers of bookings from both airports.John - Glad your tests were negative. Have a nice holiday.
Sorry our posts crossed Calderglen ; we were obviously typing at the same time.
We returned to UK yesterday on Birmingham jet2 evening flight. Staff said ours was the first return flight that had not done combined stops. The flight home had 17 passengers and they arrived in madeira with 47.
"Ah my curiosity is satisfied. Thanks Clare , Jamieboy and Calderglen. Cheers Alex"
"Thanks for that info ClareJ - whilst they will be saving on their fuel costs , in the grand scheme of things it is not cost effective to be operating flights with so few passengers. Who know what the future holds ."
"Can understand why people are cancelling their trips to Madeira this Summer. We looked at tests before travelling but as over a weekend it would have cost a lot for a large family and wouldn’t have been guaranteed to have come back in time. Funchal airport badly designed so we weren’t allowed off Gatwick flight for half an hour as another flight boarding next to us, letting a TAP flight in after us to completely disembark so a large queue for us. Friendly people sorting testing but not well organised. When only here a week spending all of first day either travelling or isolated in hotel room not a good start to holiday. Room service for lunch and probably again for dinner as results not back."
"The earliest flight arrived from Gatwick today landed at 11.40 am. The authorithies advertise the test result can take up to 12 hrs so at the time you post and complaint you don't have a test result only 8 hours since you made the test. So, exactly what failed? Were you not aware of these time scales?"
"Ant ore you where just u lucky as we had no problems and disembarked, collected luggage and had test all in about 20 minutes. 30 minute wait in such pressing times doesn’t seem that terrible to be honest. And I assume you where aware how long it took for test results before you flew ?"
"I didn’t say anything had failed - just that I could understand why people were cancelling. We decided to still come as we love Madeira and wanted to support it but the reality is still a disappointment. Also wearing masks everywhere, despite fact that Covid not really here (thanks to good work of Government) will be offputting to many."
"As I said, not fault of testing regime that poor design of airport meant couldn’t disembark an international flight while another embarking, otherwise we probably would have been a lot quicker through process. Queueing was a bit disorganised in places but again as I said staff were great. My comment was that I understood why some would be put off coming."
"Also meant to say that the 30 minute wait was on plane before we were allowed off, then we were at back of long queue for testing after passport control and baggage collection."
Ant more I doubt many airports have been designed just in case the world has a pandemic. It is to be expected there could be delays and on the website is estimated about an hour to get through so....
"""Also wearing masks everywhere, despite fact that Covid not really here (thanks to good work of Government) will be offputting to many.""The new reality is that you cannot have the best of two worlds. You either have relaxed measures and have to face an increase in infections that may lead to further lockdowns and draconian measures or you have stricter preventive measures so people are safe keeping the virus away without the need of locking people in their homes. Each country/region will decide what it's best. Madeirean authorithies decided for the latter."
Fnc paulo Madeira has coped admirably. If people respect the rules and respect others then that can only be to your advantage and from the general chatter on TA this is what shows through in comparison to other destinations.
"Fnc they did this without the need for masks in the street that has just been a very late in the day development. Time will tell if tourist will be willing to do it or not In the long term. It was very quiet when we where there And from what I have read it still is. I guess they can’t have it both ways, tests, masks etc and visitors, let’s hope not too many places close for good because of of this awful virus."
"Barbara, most tourist destinations everywhere are quiet. The ones who are just a little less quiet are the ones where the spikes are getting out of hand now and where local lockdowns are ocurring or planned. Not lockdowns in Madeira at this point. We have to be smart and think ahead of the virus (it is a ""smart"" virus) otherwise if we take strictive measures when the virus is already in the community that most likely will be too late and even more strict measures will be taken.Edited: 9:35 am, August 18, 2020 "
Fnc I am not sure how you know that as my understanding is Turkey and Greece have failed pretty well. Yes I agree but that does not change the fact that inability to travel or lack of desire for various reasons will have huge consequences for Tourism in the countries that rely on it the most. It’s very sad but most just don’t seem to want to risk it when everything is so unsettled and measures in place can change at the drop of a hat.
"Barbara, some islands in Greece are now under new lockdown and curfew rules following an increase in cases. Now, I am not that familiar with Greek social and economical life but I am pretty sure there are people in those islands that work in other sectors of activities other than tourism, they also have schools, etc. Will they put everyone under lockdown again? Will they close schools due to the outbreak? And how can an hotel be open if its workers have to stay at home with their kids because schools are closed? I agree with your comment on tourism driven economies. However it should be noted that are more indirect consequences related to tourism that afect richest countries like the UK. About 90% of the air traffic is leisure based. So, with no tourism, airlines go bust. These airlines are usually based in the richest countries. If airlines go bust, they won't be buying new aircrafs. Aircraft manufacturers will go bust and these are usually based in richest countries like UK. A few hundreads of thousands of jobs. The tourism crisis is much wider than than the restaurant shutting down or the hotel closed for the season."

"Barbara I don't have people and I don't own people so I don't know what ""your people"" means.I have been in these forums for many years trying to help (mostly) british travellers so I won't even try to argue your rather offensive post."
Rob why are you compelled to interfere? I was on last day of quarantine so yea long days why does that bother you so?a guy who like to control springs to mind but of course you cannot control strangers no matter how hard you try. Maybe just try and but out if you can at all manage that.
Fnc no of course you don’t own people but I am fairly sure you consider yourself From Madeira not Portugal just as I am English not British.My comment was not meant to offend just to make a point so apologies if I upset you.
