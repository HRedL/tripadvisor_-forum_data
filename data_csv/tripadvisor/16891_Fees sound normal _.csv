"Guess there are many in a similar predicament....what extraordinary times we are in..Booked/paid 10 day group tour (well known travel/tour Operator, 2 travellers) mid May departure $6500.Received email offer from tour group:a) Re-book later in year (Sep/Oct/Nov dates give) $900 (non refundable) additional cost. OR,b) Cancel (estimated cancellation fee $2900). (Air content $2000 Land $900) 3 months+ refund time..Two things jump out at me:1. We have not cancelled anything yet, but given the Govt. travel BAN, if we don’t respondto their cancel cost email what would happen !! Lose everything even ? AND,2. In the event we Re-book ($900 payable now) and nothing changes then we aredown another $900 on top of our current proposed loss OR we end up on a tour at an additional cost of $900.We are leaning VERY heavily towards accepting their cancellation offer and sucking up the $2900 loss...Extraordinary times as I said, would not have been foreseen by the T/A so I don’t expect to get their services for $0 but the Airlines get up my nose with their cancel fees (despite no service).Anyone else have a similar decision to make or are we the only passengers on the plane !!. Would be very grateful to get comments."
"A friend has booked a European cruise that they are now afraid to take. They are absolutely sure they don't want to go. They are prepared to cancel at the last possible date. However, they are waiting to see if the cruise operator will cancel the cruise, in which case they will get a full refund."
Not Japan related.>> We are leaning VERY heavily towards accepting their cancellation offer and sucking upWhere's your travel insurance?
"Yes, Cruise Coys seem to be more flexible, just returned 3 weeks ago from one, and the talk on the boat and www site was full refund if a rebook was not acceptable."
"Pandemic/epidemic (actual or implied) exclusion in Insurance.Group tour booking so dealing direct with Airline etc not an option.Have another trip booked for August, think we’ll just suck this one up and cross fingers for August.Edited: 6:09 pm, March 27, 2020 "
