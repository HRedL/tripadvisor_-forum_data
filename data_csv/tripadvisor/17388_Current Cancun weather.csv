"We booked a week in Cancun starting this upcoming Saturday the 27th knowing it's hurricane season, but being optimistic. Now I'm looking at the weather and every day for the next 10 days has a thunderbolt as the symbol. Yikes!Does that tend to mean part of every day has rain or are we heading into a period with an especially bad forecast? Thanks!"
Sorry to break the news but take umbrellas. There will be torrential downpours sometimes lasting hours at a time.Just kidding. Check this webcam throughout the dayroyalresorts.com/the-royal-caribbean-webcam.â€¦
read it again and comprehend what percents mean and what words like scattered and isolated mean.
I went on the Royal's live webcam and people are in the pool - and not carrying umbrellas. :) Thanks so much. Can't wait to visit Cancun!
"My daughter has been at Now Jade all week and she said the weather has been great - no rain, although it was predicted. Now our big worry is Irene - she is flying home Saturday night to JFK right about when Irene is suppose to make her grand entrance to the New York area."
I am at the Royal now. No rain the past few days. Few passing clouds and very humid. Pools are too warm and the ocean is perfect. Not many people here.
"Here is another area hotel. Not sure where they are located.http://www.nowresorts.com/jade/webcam.htmlI used a special, high tech, proprietary image enhancing program to view their faces and evaluate their happy factor.What I found was amazing. 87.4% were unhappy with 37.2% very unhappy. This is leading edge data and subject to change but perhaps you should send me there instead. I can deal with unhappiness whereas it may make you frown. I also can protect against sunburn and enjoy the beautiful blue water.For full public disclosure, I offered to go in place of others during the swine flu debacle (thanks US CDC) and not a single person sent me in their place."
"We went during the swine flu epidemic and had a GREAT time. No lines, no waiting. It was almost creepy how quiet things were but we got lots of attention from hotel staff."
"Sounds good and thanks especially for the on-site replies. We're excited. We live in LA so we're used to weather perfection and find it fun to have thundershowers and actual weather when we're on vacation.We're staying at the Royal Sands and there'll be plenty to do even if it's a bit wet. Spa, gym, shopping. Our daughter is hoping to get to participate in the turtle program if our timing is right."
