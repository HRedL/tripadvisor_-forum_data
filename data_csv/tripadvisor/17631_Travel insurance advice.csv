Hi. I have a ten day trip booked to France beginning 25th May and wondered if anyone could advise on a good single trip policy that will cover me for cancellation and any other losses as a result of cancelling ? I have a reasonably mild health condition that hasn’t required treatment for over a year. I have trawled the internet but so many results and information........ most of it contradictory ! If anyone could offer some guidance I would be very grateful. Kind regards Rob
It is no use asking in the France forum unless you live there (which you appear to not do).You have to take out travel insurance in the country in which you are resident.
My family has used Allianz Travel Insurance for years with excellent service and I had a huge claim due to an emergency surgery before I left for 3 separate trips. Go on line and establish an account and then do queries about the type of policy that fits your needs. There may be limitations that I am unaware of due to your time of booking details and amount of coverage you desire. Good luck. Safe travels.
"Hello Robert,Trip cancellation & Travel insurance can be very confusing indeed!If I understand correctly you have a trip already booked and the possibility of a pre-existing condition.Your best coverage would be a primary coverage with pre-existing condition waiver...However, this would need to be purchased within a time frame (usually 21 days) from the time you secure your trip with a deposit (hence my question about trip being paid yet).Another policy to have would be one with ""Cancel For Any Reason""...but again, this benefit is time-sensitive.If the trip is deposited but not yet paid in full, you can still get a general trip cancellation & travel coverage -- excluding coverage for pre-existing condition.If the trip is paid in full, it shall be too late to purchase any coverage.A good place to browse coverages is insuremytrip.com and the one I personally use is travelinsured.com Hope this helps!Has the trip been paid yet?"
"If you book within usually 14 days of your first deposit on your trip many policies cover pre-existing conditions. What is not covered it anything related to the current pandemic. If you get Corona or are forced to quarantine or whatever, there is a clause in US policies and I assume others that means they cover none of that."
"If you are looking for trip cancellation coverage because you are concerned about the Coronavirus, you need to purchase a plan that includes Cancel For Any Reason since the travel warnings are now foreseen"
I would bet that even 'cancel for any reason' policies sold now in the middle of the epidemic will exclude corona related delays. Obviously check that out -- but usually you cannot insure for a disaster that is already unfolding.
"'cancel for any reason policies sold now in the middle of the epidemic will exclude corona related delays""This is not the case (so far) -- “Cancel For Any Reason” benefit includes fear of traveling due to coronavirus prior to departure. Some plans also include “Interruption for Any Reason” coverage which is available for use AFTER your departure date.https://francecruises.com/blog-detail/planni…"
"welcome,you need to contact the insurance company and be specific about your concerns.for what its worth, not sure where you live or how youve experienced life,...You dont want to pay for it but when you need it, you are glad you do. And then you dont know how good that insurance is UNTIL you file a claim.Also, you may want to contact your bank? or credit card company. Some of them offer limited? insurance just for using their card.As far as the Cancelling for anything, what ive read before is that you must have bought the insurance x many days/hours after you made your trip purchase or whatever. But you will need to read the individual polices that are out there.Also, you may one day decide to put a location in your profile. TA is a global community and you may figure out that what is done 1 way in 1 country is not necessarily so outside of that country.good luck"
