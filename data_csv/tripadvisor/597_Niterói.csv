Rio Municipality can not pay on time the salaries of the employees working in public institutions so this is why they need more money.Miki
Not sure what you want to know but I stayed in Niteroi last summe during the Olympics. It's a busy place but I felt safe. Most of the time I took a ferry to Rio. If you take a taxi from Rio be careful because some will charge you to go back across the bridge too.
"Not my cup of tea, but at least you can see the mountains of Rio from a different angle.It is easily accessible by ferry if you don't feel like going over the bridge where traffic can be a problem.It is a good starting point for visiting the Rio de Janeiro Lake District (Saquarema, Araruama, Cabo Frio), Santa Maria Madalena, and Búzios.Edited: 3 years ago "

"Niterói Contemporary Art Museum by Oscar Niemeyer:https://bit.ly/2T50SqI“It’s a building located in a wonderful site, which I liked very much. And that made the design process quite easy. It is a headland surrounded by the sea, and the building is located in its middle. The problem was to find out how to support it. (…) And then, the idea for Niteroi came to my mind naturally.
