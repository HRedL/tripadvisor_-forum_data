There is one case in Fuerteventura at the moment. A local person who visited north Italy at the end of February.
"We all know it's here, albeit in very small numbers, but I haven't noticed anyone panicking. Loo rolls available everywhere, nobody wearing masks, people greeting others the ""normal"" way..."
What is the general feeling amongst the ex-pats and locals alike out there ?.Obviously this could affect the numbers coming out there on hols the longer this dammed thing goes on
"There is still only one reported case here.However, the Canarian Government have closed all schools from today, and all after-school and sporting events have been stopped."
"Just to say that I don't think it was the Canaries govt that took action. Madrid made the decision for all of Spain.All the restsurants and bars in Corralejo are business as usual, AFAIK, although the rest of carnival events have been cancelled."
What controls in place at the airport currently?
"Madrid's schools and Universities were closed on Tuesday. It was the Canarian Government that closed schools with a decision at 3pm yesterday.The Saturday and Tuesday market has now been cancelled, and the Yelmo Cinema has also closed from today.All measures are a precaution."
Get a grip and fgs Sheila you posted a few weeks ago. You berated an OP for raising a question about travelling to the canaries and accused scaremongering. The situation has become intense everywhere now. Perhaps you should apologise to those people who asked a question from a respected advisor as yourself? Peter from Israel springs to mind. I'm sure he is still following and keeping a quiet and content feeling of just desserts. Alot of people on here had a go at him.
All people do is ask for information and advice from people like Sheila. I look forward to hearing what people like Sheila say as they have local knowledge. We all say the wrong thing from time to time but let's keep it polite so people dont feel like they can't ask for information
We are due to arrive on Wednesday. Is life still functioning as ‘ norma’ in Caleta de Fuste? TIA
Hi all.Just off the phone to jet2 (hour long hold wait).We are due to travel glasgow to fuerteventura sat 28/03. Advisor said current cancellations for jet2 spanish flights are the next 7 days. If outwith 7 days you would need to pay a charge to cancel. If within it you can get a full refund or change your holiday of course.He said as we are all aware situation is changing everyday (got vibe he was saying it will probably get extended which eould be no surprise).
"Sue, post12. The Spanish Government are currently announcing measures that will try to limit all movement of people from 8am on Monday 17 March. More details later."
"I should mention here that on 28th Feb I received a highly abusive private message from Louise H, which was reported to Trip Advisor.For info, if anyone cares, here's the text of my first response to Peter, the OP in the thread mentioned:""There is no general panic here, believe me. People are following the news and assessing the situation. I dare say some that are prone to panicking are doing just that - but then they would.It was a bit of a surprise to discover that Spain's very first case was in little old La Gomera, but it doesn't seem to have spread -- it was first reported quite some time ago, the patient himself is barely ill at all, and his friends have all tested normal although kept in quarantine. And the authorities are well aware of all the people the patient will have come across on the way here and are following up.""No telling the OP to get a grip and no berating him. Some later posts in that thread -- I can't remember who by -- were seriously crazy though."
"Sheila that's unfair and you know it wasnt a highly abusive DM.I said similar to the second post, and I asked if you were aware that at times you come across as nasty and caustic in your replies. I also said that you have a fabulous wealth of first hand knowledge that is very welcomed.Please dont post here that I was highly abusive. Did I use foul language? I also said the way you sometimes reply is abrupt, and that put me off posting anything."
"Louise, you don't have to swear to be abusive. Some bullies never swear but that doesn't mean that bullying isn't abusive."
"Sheila I am really not a bully. Nor wish to continue our disagreement here any further.i stand by what I said and I apologise if you think I'm a bully. But let's get this straight I said you (came across) nasty and abrupt(at times) and I thought you may not be aware it puts people off asking questions..Nothing highly abusive in that..and it was a private message. I can see you think I am wrong, I will accept it an move on."
"A State of Alarm has been declared in Spain. From 8am on Monday 16 March there will be a series of measures that limit freedom of movement.A Google Translation:In summary, people will only be able to circulate through public use roads individually in certain cases, and the opening to the public of bars, restaurants or sports venues is suspended.The Council of Ministers has approved a Royal Decree declaring the state of alarm for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19, whose main measures, applicable throughout Spain, limit freedom of movement.During the validity of the State of Alarm (fifteen days extendable), citizens may only circulate through public use routes ""individually"" for the following activities:Acquisition of food, pharmaceuticals and basic necessities; assistance to health centers or financial entities; go to work; return to habitual residence; take care of the elderly, minors, dependents, people with disabilities or especially vulnerable people.In addition, circulation is permitted only where necessary or in a situation of need or any other activity of an analogous nature duly justified.Private vehicles may circulate only to carry out the permitted activities.

"It now appears that the State of Alarm comes into effect at midnight tonight, as bars are being visited by the police and told to close."
"Is this just mainland Spain or is it Fuerteventura as well ? I’ve literally just stepped off the plane from Alicante and after a long delay jet2 sent out an empty plane to get us home. All of Valencia is in lockdown ie bars and restaurants closed by decree of law. We are due to fly to caleta on the first of April for a week I’m a little apprehensive after the ordeal of the last 24 hours. information is changing rapidly, seemingly by the hour so thanks for your help and professionalism on this."
"It is Fuerteventura as well. Only food shops, petrol stations and chemists are allowed to open. There is minimal movement on the road outside my house. Everyone is being told to stay at home."
"Hi Iam due to fly out on 18th, staying in Caleta, could someone tell me if all the bars and restaurants in the town are closed, Thank you."
"Yes, they are closed. They are not allowed to open.I can't imagine that you'll be flying here on the 18th."
we ar due to fly in on Tuesday 17th March are the hotels etc operating as normal foe All Inclusive? Our flight has not been cancelled yet but don`t want to come & have to stay in Hotel room?
"Goldwing - you will have to stay in your hotel if you manage to get here. Swimming pools are closed and the police have started fining people for being out in the street.I'm not allowed to leave my house except to go to a supermarket or chemist.No-one is allowed to walk out (except to walk a dog for a minimal walk, at a distance from others). The beaches are also a prohibited area."
"thanks for info hoping flight will be cancelled now to at least get a refund!enjoy the peace & quiet,hopefully be able to visit soon."
"Up to now Ryanair has not cancelled flights to the canaries, they are still bringing holidaymakers to the islands that are in lockdown."
I am due to fly in 4 weeks with ryanair.I think its a disgrace that ryanair are flying people out to basically sit in a hotel room.The airports should not allow these flights to land in their country
Ryanair are not cancelling flights to the canaries . No cancellation No refunds. Don’t give a toss about their customers The Canarian government should stop all inbound European flights to safeguard their residents ( and to stop Ryanair ripping off customers)
Day 2 of lockdown.There are now 6 active cases of the virus on Fuerteventura.
"Due to fly out 21st March , on the beach cancelled booking , Ryan air still not cancelled flights, why are they still going there knowing how bad the situation is , Pure greed with them ... good luck anyone trying to get a refund"
Just wondering if Caleta De Fusta is in Lockdown today as I'm due to travel there on the 26th?Thanks.
"My question re: RyanairIt's clear they are forcing customers to cancel to avoid refunds or re-book for later travel. If you re-book travel for a later date to a region that the FCO are currently advising against all but essential travel to, would that not invalidate any future insurance claim?"
"@Kevin LIt seems so. For at least 15 days and then, who knows?"
"All hyperthetical at the moment but IF this is still all going on at the end of May , which I am sure it will be , what would happen in these instances.If Ryanair cancel flights , and refunded us for them ,would I be able to get the cost of my accommodation back booked independently through Travel Republic? I didn't book with the free cancellation option.If Ryan don't cancel flights and we did turn up at the accommodation would you they have to feed and water us , as we are all inclusive , or would we just be stranded for the week in the room?Worrying times for a lot of us …..."
I do feel for you and all of those caught up in this awful situation TruthWolverhampton.The way that I understand it the hotel could still charge you if they were open for business even if your flights were cancelled and you were unable to get there. Under the circumstances one would hope that they would give you the option to rebook your dates or just cancel.I hope it all works out for you good luck.
"Unfortunately we had to cancel hotel but we have booked for September and keeping everything crossed we will be able to go .We moved our flights also (Easy Jet) ) which cost another £157, which was the difference in the flight cost only, as they didn’t charge to change the dates."
"Cheers Caleta !Gutted really as my Moms just got her cancer under control and we had booked her and my Dad to come out with us this time . Only booked there's a month ago , they need the break !"
"As said on here before , we are due to fly out on the 18th with Ryanair, my flight hasn’t been cancelled, but Ryanair have sent me an email saying that I could change my flight. I tried to do this but they would only give me the price of the flight , the cost of any seats and luggage they don’t refund. However when I tried to do this , Ryanair site wouldn’t allow me to continue . Tried this a few times and couldn’t change my flight. We have a house in Caleta but friends travelling with us have had a full refund from the Barcelo hotel that they booked. ......Ryanair well , showing their true colours. NO Cancellation NO refunds. PROFIT before customers wellbeing.Edited: 5:17 am, March 17, 2020 "
"We are in the Elba Sara and everything is locked down. We are due to return to UK on Saturday 21st but Jet2 aren't sure if we can leave sooner. The pool is shut, only allowed to walk to shop. We arrived on Friday 13th, one of the last flights that were allowed in, everything shut on Saturday night so we're having a ball :)Jet2 are saying there'll be no refunds which is really annoying but our health is good so that is the priority right now.Keep safe everyone!"
What would you want a refund for.
"If you have checked in online you cannot change your flights. You must phone customer care and wait for a reply, be patient, leave your phone on speaker and wait for answer. It took 2.5 hours for us to get an answer. Ask for your booking to be unchecked, this will allow you to change your flights. Hope this helps"

Unbelievable.
"Ryanair said in a statement today: “In response to the decision of the Spanish Government to “lock down” the entire country to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus, Ryanair Group Airlines (including Buzz and Lauda) has been forced to severely reduce flights to/from Spain, the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from 24:00 Sun 15 Mar until 24:00 Fri 20 Mar.“Customers that were already checked-in for their return flight may have experienced difficulties to change their booking. “Today we are unchecking all customers booked on flights exiting Spain from 21 Mar to 28 Mar and advising them to apply for a free move on an alternative date via our online service."
Burrs Ref 44.Why post such a comment?What is the point when people are stuck on the island in this awful situation.
"Because , Caleta , some people speak / type before they think mate !All stay safe and knuckle down , it will get worse before its gets better BUT it will get better ……."

"Are your government supporting local businesses, helping to pay wages ...etc.How will people survive if not"
"Things are being put in place to support people, but it will take time as most people here are employed in the tourist industry which is non existent now.There are currently 17 cases on the island now - 16 in isolation at home and 1 in hospital."
Love and best wishes to everyone on the island.Hopefully u can all get back to some sort of normality ASAP. Very worrying times
"Awfull times everywhere, fuerteventura is in the same boat as everybody else. I would love to think that we could get back to some normality but alas that is a long way off.I know people have been asking about pre booked holidays here as early as may, even if flights were operating what are you flying to?Fuerteventura and just like any other tourist destination will take years to recover.If you live here you will still have the weather and beautiful beaches but tourist infrastructure will not exist for a long time."
Are places likely to be open from sept 3rd 2020
"Like asking, what length is a piece of string? There is no cure for this killer regardless of whatever is said."
