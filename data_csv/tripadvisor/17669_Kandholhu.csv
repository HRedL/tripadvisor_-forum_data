"I scrapped my previous hotel plans/search and threw caution (and credit card) to the wind and booked Kandholhu! I'm so excited I can hardly contain myself.Any tips about the resort (rooms, excursions, etc)? Burmu, where are you!?Cheers,AG"
Hi AileronIn my opinion DL6 is the best bungalow nicely positioned for the sunset no near neighbours on one side. The excursions all take care of themselves as snorkelling picnics and sunset cruises are all free. The night fishing isn't but good fun. When are you going?RegardsDoug
"Hi Kent,Thanks for the reply. Regarding DL6, does that particular room have a close neighbor on the other side? We're heading out there in early June. Have you visited Kandholhu around that time, and if so, how was the weather?Cheers,AGEdited: 10 years ago "
Hi AGThere is a row of 6 and they all equidistant about 10 feet apart slightly staggered and 1& 6 have no neighbours on one side- 7&8 are the other side of the yoga pavilions but right opposite the 4 water bungalows there nothing wrong with any of them it's just a little more private and more beach at high tide.We had lemons and ice delivered each day at 4.30 to make our G&T's .We then took our chairs to the waters edge to drink them and watch the sunset much to the amusement of the other guests. We have only been late Jan/Early Feb the last two years.The coral is unbelievable within a couple of metres from the waters edge. The food is first rate which an excellent German chef I would suggest half board is the option to take. The resort has it's own Turkish style gulet for the excursions which are excellent. I take it you booked with a German agent which means you'll pay in Euros or Dollars it's worth signing up with UK Forex to get free transfer and a better exchange rate(absolutely terrible at the moment) than you'll get from your bank. Be prepared to be the only English on the island!RegardsDoug
"Hi Doug, I called you Kent in my last post and just realized my mistake... sorry :). Drinks at sunset by the water's edge sound fantastic. Just curious why everyone was so amused by it? I know the coral is supposed to be the best in the Maldives, but how is the fish life? Are the currents strong? We did book on half-board basis, but not w/ a German operator. The best quote we received was from an Irish TA. I am from North America and would've loved to pay in Dollars, but the quote was in Euros. I'll def. check out Forex on this side of the pond. Did you find the other guests friendly and social or did everyone just keep to themselves?Cheers,AG"
Hi AGSorry didn't realise you're not from UK. Presumably that was Escape2 you are with we found that e-two the German agent was cheaper and although last year they invoiced in Euros this year it was in US Dollars which would really have suited you. The fish life is wonderful the currents vary but really the wind is more of a factor in Jan/Feb the wind is on the restaurant/bar side of the island and the bungalows are windless this may change round in June as it's a different monsoon period. The main snorkelling area is from the main jetty back toward the service jetty although you can go right round the island and this is where it was fairly windy earlier in the year. Guest do keep mainly to themselves but when you do the yacht trips you meet people and they are friendly enough and fortunately speak English well (they have to the island works in English).We are Maldives regulars and this is the only island we have repeated and it's absolutely lovely and you can't help but be bowled over by it. When arrive make any special requests like our lemon and ice Jenny also likes smoked salmon for breakfast so that went on our list we changed the super duper coffee machine for a kettle as it's easier for tea but guess this won't be for you.When we arrived this year they had our previous list of wants already booked in for us.RegardsDoug
"HI Doug,I read that the best deals were coming from German operators, but much to my surprise the best offer I received was from Escape 2. It was a significantly lower offer than everyone else... Are the meals served buffet style everyday? Is there much variety on the food front? Are alcoholic beverages priced reasonably? It all sounds so fantastic. I've been researching the Maldives for so long, I can't believe I'm finally going. I have a feeling I'm about to develop an expensive habit LOL.Cheers,AG"
"Hi AGOnly breakfast is buffet style but includes full English cooked if required real bacon and sausages.. Dinner offers a choice of three starters plus soup, three main courses and various sweets. The only repeats in 14days were 1 fish barbeque and 1 meat barbeque per week. The food was definitely top class.There are three Phillipino girls that wait on table plus two very nice Maldivian lads whom we named Naughty Boy 1 and Naughty Boy 2- try asking them which is which and show them how their fame has spread internationally they'll be highly amused and no doubt remember who gave them their names. If the wind direction has changed you will be served a lot of evening meals on the beach by candlelight which is truly lovely. I'm sure you realise that by my writing all this just how much we loved the place and I'm sure you will also. If you want any more info please don't hesitate to askKind RegardsDoug"
Hi AGSorry forgot the alcohol query basically about normal expensive Maldives prices I think gin & tonic in the bar was about $8.50 but everything does get a 10% service charge.Buy your water from the bar plus if you have it with your meal take any spare back to your room as it's cheaper than using the mini bar which contains expensive named bottled water. Spirits from the mini bar seem to be the same price as from the bar hence our request for ice and lemon to make our own sunset drinks (the bar is on the sunrise side)RegardsDoug
"It's a great island, been there in may 2008. Great food (take half board, best plan in my opinion), nice people, beautiful reef (I made 3 trips to Maldives and never saw so many turtles & black tip sharks), but there is always something wrong: in my case, it was plastic. Some days I could see hundreds of floating plastics everywhere, I tried to pick them up but they were too many. It depends on the current. Some days you won't see one and the day after they're back. It's gonna be our main problem in this century, plastics are everywhere in the world. That's sad."
"HI Doug,Thanks again for being so helpful. The dinners sound fantastic. Hopefully, the winds will cooperate. Just curious how Naughty Boys 1 and 2 earned their titles :-). Ahh, the mini-bar. I was wondering why you only requested the lemons and ice, but didn't want to pry LOL.I'll post a comprehensive trip report when I return.Best,AG"
"Yellowsub,Did you encounter plastics around Khandholu? Yes, it is an epidemic that is harming the environment. Sadly, there's just not enough public education about the problem. It's a pervasive problem in the Caribbean and pacific, as well.-AG"
"In May the current is coming from the west (where the water bungalows are), and that's where I saw many plastics. Actually I exagerated in my other message because I saw a LOT of plastics only one day. But I could see at least two or three floating plastics everyday. It was outside the reef. If you like to swim far, go at the extreme side of the west reef , that's where all the food is (because of the current kicking in), so plenties of fishes. I saw the adult black tip sharks there (around 2 meters long although difficult to say under water), almost every day, I was a bit afraid the first time because they were three sharks around me but then you get used to them. Also they are not dangerous sharks for humans. I do snorkeling by the way.This is the best island of the three I have been to (other were Reethi beach & Helengili which was nice too). The food is so good, unlike Reethi & Helengili. It's heaven when you get out of the seaplane. I won't spoil it though so you'll have the surprise. Enjoy your holidays."
"I'm slightly surprised about what Yellowsub says as Kandholhu is the only island we've stayed on that we didn't see any rubbish washed up (I don't make a point of swimming outside the reef though). If it was just on one day perhaps there was an instance of a boat chucking overboard (which of course is not acceptable), rather than taking their rubbish home (which, incidentally, we have always done). It's sad that what's done elsewhere in the world can spoil paradise but until there was tourism in the islands I'm sure most of the local trash went ""over the side"" - it's just that there is much more 21st century rubbish even from the inhabited islands these days which they would not have had such easy access to in the days before tourism brought in money for bottled water and canned drinks. Visiting locally inhabited islands back in the 80s we were really shocked at the state of the water's edge - rattling with cans and other rubbish while the local men sat around smoking amidst it. I guess to them it was not paradise spoiled - it was just where their boats tied up. I think they're a lot wiser now about rubbish and their environment generally since what goes on at inhabited islands has a good chance of spoiling a tourist island that brings income which benefits the whole country. It was the impression I got anyway - certainly no-one was clearing up the mess. Staff on the tourist islands usually are round the island before breakfast collecting any flotsam and jetsam and sweeping up the fallen leaves so unless you are a dawn snorkeller like me it usually looks pristine (until the next high tide and hopefully guests pick up any odd washed up bottle encountered during a stroll and make sure it gets above high water line and gets collected so it doesn't keep coming back, or in a bin if there is one).One big help would be if people would not smoke on the beach and stick their dog-ends in the sand. That really upsets me, especially when you see a bird trying one out for food.It's still the cleanest and most beautiful place I know, though. You'll love it.And, AG, you are beginning a very expensive habit, especially from your neck of the woods! Enjoy.BTW we were in DL7 and it was lovely. View from room tripadvisor.co.uk/…18132683"
Hi AGThey got their names by larking about teasing the girls and squirting the cleaning liquid when they were cleaning up after breakfast we noticed and caught their eye and got a guilty grin and we gave them their names.There's a lot of criticism for the regime in the Maldives but their education system is first class and it's noticeable how well the younger locals speak English. RegardsDoug
Hi AGI forgot to tell there are now 7 turtles regularly on the island reef so they are not difficult to see even without going into the water as they are often surfacing by the main jettyRegardsDoug
"Hi AG -I am so glad and envious - really wish it was me going there again!It is the best island!!I would go for the bungalow 2, or where Nakatcha stayed - in D7 (or 8).The only difference is that the 7& 8 are a bit further away from 1 - 6.Also these (7 & 8 ) don't have outdoor bathrooms - if I remember correct.Nak - can you confirm? ;)So maybe that is important to you...?We stayed in #3, which was, at the time, too close to the #4. I think they now have increased the vegetation between the two.Hopefully there is still the two boats, used for excursions. They do different kinds of cruises almost every day, so just enjoy yourself.If it is run the same way, they will treat you absolutely wonderful.The staff was very charming when we were there, and the food was wonderful.My girlfriend even got some of the dessert recepies from the kitchen ;)Kandholhu is still my #1 island, followed by Mirihi and Athuruga.So - hope you will have a wonderful holiday, and start saving for the next one ;)Sorry it took so long to answer, but I have my hands full ;)best,;-b"
"Yup, confirmed, burmu, Indoor (but very nice, if smaller) bathroom in D7 (and probably D8) but larger bedroom and more private ""garden type"" area, set back from beach, with front door access from path rather than from beach. Directly in line with sunset.Hope you, I and S and well. Not long to go now eh! Are you getting excited?"
Hi BurmaThey only use the gulet now every other day for short and long snorkel trips and the sunset cruise. The dive boat is for diving (surprisingly) and they use a different for night fishing-might even be the dive boat now I come to think about itI wish I was back there again right now alsoRegardsDoug
"Nakatcha - Thanks for the pictures and room recommendation. I think I am going to put D7 on request. I know exactly what you mean about littering. I never understood why people trash the very place that draws them there. Doug - Thanks again for the all the helpful info. I will keep my eyes peeled for the turtles. Yellosub - Sounds like it would be quite a spectacle, but dunno if I'll venture outside of the reef.... 8-DBurmu - No probs. I guess I'll start dieting now so I don't exceed the weight restrictions on the return seaplane flight LOL.Cheers,AG"
"It's so easy to see turtles - you only have to sit at the end of the jetty and wait. They pop up for air about every 15 minutes and seem to like it round the jetty so every few minutes you see one break surface. Once you suss that out all you need to do is climb down the ladder with your snorkelling kit to get up close and personal. We watched one for ages from just a couple of feet away munching its breakfast. Magic! As far as food goes, they did a great veg curry and a divine passion fruit creme brulee. We were lucky enough to be there in late Feb, when all dinners were on the beach and the menu comes with one of those booklights to read it, and they have candles and flaming torches along the sand and it's lovely eating under the stars.I'm getting all nostalgic now ......"
"Nakatacha,Thanks for the tip about the turtles. Just curious about dinner attire. Are shorts and t-shirts suitable?  I'll probably be right there w/ you waxing nostalgic this time next year :). Are you going back anytime soon?Cheers,AG"
Hi AGShorts and T shirt absolutely fine- you won't need shoes.You've made us all nostalgic and we've only been back since mid February!!RegardsDoug
"We've never taken anything BUT shorts and t-shirts and wouldn't contemplate going there at all if any dressing up was required. Some people do but it wouldn't be a holiday for me if anything other than comfort in the heat was required. That means a t-shirt, shorts, and bare feet at all times not actually in the sea.Sadly we have had a rather disastrous time recently, AG, and can't go on holiday anywhere, let alone Kandholhu but if we were in a position to, that is no doubt where we would go. You will love it, I'm sure."
"That's what I figured....just wanted to make sure. Nakatcha, I'm sorry to hear of your troubles. I help things improve for you soon.Cheers,AGEdited: 10 years ago "
