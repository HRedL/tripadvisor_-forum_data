Now that Hawaii is opening to tourists with a negative test I am looking for helpContacted my Doc and she says that you have to be sick to get a cover test and they are not doing it for travel. Also results are not coming back that quicklyWe have been researching online and can't find any lab we can get a test without doc sending us. Have to have symptomAnyone live in this area having any better luck?Thanks

"Hawaii has been quite clear about travel restriction, and this Covid 19 testing option is new and will start on Aug. 1st. Alaska has been offered this option in lieu of quarantine for 1+ week now. Many are watching to see how that develops.Here in Spokane, testing sites are listed in County health district website. I got a rapid test done for medical reason last week by contacting a Providence Urgent care clinic (local Indigo clinic also offers testing), set up a virtual visit, then given an appt at a test site. The results came back in 15 minutes. I don't see why a test cannot be performed for traveling reason unless there's a shortage of testing kits. GL"
"A Google search shows that the city of Seattle is offering free testing at 2 drive-thru locations. It looks like you don't need to have symptoms, but you need to make an appointment. seattle.gov/mayor/covid-19/covid-19-testing There is also a link to King County page for more testing locations."
Thanks to all for suggestions. I did see the testing sites that are drive up but the days of the week don't work for our flights and the results according to my doc at the labs are taking 3-5 days so too long. The 7 2 hours is the issue so farNot sure if the rapid 15 minute test qualifies as Hawaii says it just be the PCR test. Gonna call ore labs today and see if anyone can meet this timeline. I know this is a new requirement. Our trip is Aug 5th so not far off
"I did read on the AK forum that someone from Seattle went up and was tested here before they left, but they ran into a snag. They were tested within 72 hours, but the results showed the time of the test as say being 9am when the test was done say at 2pm, so it showed that they were past the 72 hour requirement. Something about all of that days tests being listed as the same time. So maybe read the AK forum to the the details since I can't remember them enough to be more helpful."
"This is the thread that I was referring to. For Seattle specific, read post 102.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28923…"
"Canceled the trip after calling many labs and contacting my doc etc. Could not find anywhere guaranteeing the quick result. Also since we just hit a record for new cases yesterday many are not doing testing for travel reasons.Like most the rest the country we are not in a good place, running out of swabs and basic supplies to do testing.Very sad situation that did not need to be this way."
"Yup. Better to not travel regardless, though. I don’t think the new Hawaii policy will last very long if implemented at all."
"Agreed, Marie. Too many unknowns.~ Colleen"
Just not the time for leisure travel.
