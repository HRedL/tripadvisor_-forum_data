"PSA: Resort Fees EXCLUDE additional sales tax. AFAIU, *all* hotels will charge full 14.75% sales tax on-top of their advertised per night Resort Fee. So be aware. For example, the total would be... $35 per night – advertised Resort Fee +$5.16 per night – 14.75% sales tax = $40.16 per night TOTAL Resort Fee i.e. a nice $30+ extra for a weeks' stay that you’ve likely have not been made aware of at booking time! NYC hotels are becoming idiotic anyway. Get this, mine says the Resort Fee includes things that hotels have been designed to offer as their very raison d’etre as hotels, since forever: 'room maid service' (i.e. bed sheet changing) that nearly every hotel does under the normal room price! lol. Next they’ll start listing things like ""stairs"" or ""elevator"" or ""carpets"" as part of the crappy resort fee. NYC is becoming an utter nightmare to book hotels for, as endless ""additional’s"" are added continually and costs are not broken-down properly on most booking/hotel sites’ search results. Whoever makes these decisions about making tourists lives a misery when making bookings to visit their city, should be shot. I likely won't bother going to NYC again, as it's too stressful trying to account for ones budget, without continual ""extra 1, extra 2, extra 3, extra 4, extra 5, extra 6"" items that should be made clear AT THE TIME of search comparisons. Yes NYC has always been expensive and remains so (I live in London, and it's the same here, so nothing new to me, and I'm not talking about the cost), but the increase in underhanded half-hidden profit-making exercises, are a joke, and NYC is becoming just that.Edited: 1 year ago "

"Re: post 21Jimthing has pointed to the issue of taxes and fees.In NYC, hotel charges consist of 4 items (apart from refundable deposits less charges for damage or incidentals):1. Room rate (set by the hotel)2. Tax on room rate and occupancy (14.75% tax plus $3,50 city tax/fee nightly, both required by law)3. Resort fee (set by hotel and almost always, where applied, based on per room—not per person—per night) 4. Tax on resort fee (at the rate of 8.875% nightly—different from the room tax rate—required by law.Thus the total charge of a “resort fee” has both extra fee and tax-on-extra-fee components.Many resort fee hotels also may have items which carry unanticipated cost. (For example, a majority of Manhattan resort fee hotels—identified in LIST 2 here)—do NOT provide coffee machines as standard in the rooms, thereby involving inconvenience and additional expense for securing it, sometimes several times daily during the stay.)Jimthing expresses displeasure with resort fee properties. Anticipating this concern, contributors have identified 214 Manhattan hotels which do not charge them (LIST 2 here), offering visitors a range of choice.Edited: 1 year ago "

I stayed at the staypineapple in Midtown this week. Was charged $82 for a resort fee. Didn't think I could opt out of it. Not sure what it was for because there was no service of any kind as far as room service or any special amenities. I'm a bit confused after reading another thread about marriott's resort fees. Is the resort fee supposed to go towards something? I thought it was a cash grab
"We are sorry to learn of your disappointment.The hotel’s resort fee plus tax is quoted at $28.69 nightly per room.The amenities offered by the hotel are listed on the hotel’s site and (in a lengthy link) at https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/staypineapple-artful-hotel-new-york.html?aid=318615;label=New_English_EN_US_MD%3A_Maryland_23616227185-7JdiO3zgOSspg2DJKjRoogSM91939162825%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap1t1%3Aneg;sid=a2ca90437f1d960f516b912813c1f856;all_sr_blocks=396178019_177357072_2_0_0;checkin=2020-01-14;checkout=2020-01-15;dest_id=20088325;dest_type=city;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=1;highlighted_blocks=396178019_177357072_2_0_0;hpos=1;matching_block_id=396178019_177357072_2_0_0;no_rooms=1;ref_is_wl=1;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;srepoch=1575189882;srpvid=92ca3d7cd61d013e;type=total;ucfs=1&Slightly less than 50% of Manhattan hotels now charge mandatory resort fees.The fee is controversial. Hotels view them as covering amenities; more than a few guests view them (as you do) as a device for extra hotel profit, an obstacle to learning total hotel costs so guests can compare prices, and lacking consumer justification.An accurate comparison of prices includes price and amenities. A resort fee hotel which offers amenities you like may be a good total value; by comparison, one which charges the same rate, resort fee and taxes but does not offer amenities you want is not an attractive value.The resort fee and tax (usually itemized) are disclosed on a price quote prior to booking, so a careful review can help avoid surprises.

"There has been a major, positive development in third-party billing for resort fee (and non-resort fee) Manhattan hotels.For some time, Booking.com has displayed nightly room rate and amenities approximately side-by-side on the first page of each hotel listing--with notations on resort fees and taxes in lower pages.Now: booking.com lists room rate--but then the total tax and charges on the very next line, without having to scroll down. For those concerned with resort fees, this is useful. If the total charge is much more than 115% of the room rate, it is an indication there may be a resort or other fee--the amount and breakdown of which can be determined by scrolling down.Edited: 11:23 pm, December 01, 2019 "

We booked the Double Tree Times Square West via booking.com and paid in advance for a stay in February 2020. There was no mention of resort fee on booking and payment - the only additional charge I can see listed is a small city tax. Does this mean we're likely to get charged the resort fee on checkout?

No.The original policy was no fee, that was changed to yes fee, and recently changed back to no fee—now consistent with other NYC Doubletree no resort fee policy.Thus the original List 2 entry is correct, and the hotel’s reference in Posts 47 and 50 should be deleted.The totals are now 203/210 = 413.Thanks again.Edited: 8:39 am, January 29, 2020 "
LittleBiffOne thank you for responding so quickly. That sounds like good news although I am a bit confused as when I went digging for information on booking.com I have just found confirmation that the hotel does charge a resort fee $34.42 per night. I wonder if the booking.com information is out of date - do you know when this Doubletree reversed its resort fee policy (went back to no fee)?
"Booking.com now lists no resort fee. I called the hotel this morning; the response was no fee. I also asked about the date of the change(s), and the reservationist did not know.Why not write the hotel now and request no resort fee charge, given the change in policy. Point out that is the common policies were found on TripAdvisor, and you would be grateful for their graciousness. If they say no to a refund, write back and ask instead for a credit to hotel services, meals and amenities you will use.They may have a technical contract point, since you previously agreed to it. But wise customer relations would extend you the courtesy. (They give out chocolate chip cookies, right?)Bring the exchange of correspondence with you. If you’re not satisfied with the result, request to see the general manager for a moment when you arrive, soon after you check in, and explain the situation in your already-cordial tone.Please let us know what happens.

"Thank you so much for your help and especially for calling the hotel. I really appreciate the valuable service you are providing.My reservation details do not mention the resort fee at all (we booked in December 2019). I found the reference to resort fees in the booking.com 'Questions' box for this hotel, completely unrelated to my booking details. So maybe that particular information resource is out of date?As far as I am aware we have not been charged this fee and I am now fairly confident (thanks to you!) that there won't be a surprise fee on check in/ check out, just the incidental refundable deposit which I was aware of (but have not come across elsewhere in the world!)."

"The NH Hotel (a renovation of the former Jolly Madison Hotel), opening April 1, has a resort fee. The totals are 204/210=414.Edited: 12:04 am, February 16, 2020 "
"Ok, I must be the only confused person in the universe here because everyone else reading these posts seem to understand them. But I don't get what the 2 figures are with the total for each hotel. Is the first figure the stated room cost, the 2nd figure depicting all the taxes and fees and the final figure the sum of the first 2 figures? The 2nd figure always seems to be higher than the first figure so am I understanding correctly that the taxes and fees are always higher than the actual room cost?? If so, that is really ridiculous! I have traveled all over the world and never seen that. I actually rent out vacation rentals myself and have never seen that."
"cjv: Following a new or revised property policy, the figures in the each post are:The first figure is the total of licensed and inspected Manhattan hotels which then DO charge a resort fee and mandatory resort fee tax.The second figure is the number of Manhattan hotels which then do NOT charge resort fee and tax. The third figure is the total Manhattan hotels in the survey thus far (the first plus the second). Thus, none of these three figures represents the dollar amount of a fee or a tax. Over the next 24 months, approximately 50 hotels are tentatively scheduled to open in Manhattan (with some delays likely). We can expect all three figures to increase as the properties open and their rate policies are announced. A change in policy of an existing hotel, however, will adjust the first and second figures—usually to increase the first (resort fee) and decrease the second (no resort fee)—but not the third (the total, which remains constant at that point).Edited: 11:15 pm, February 23, 2020 "

Hotels are going to take a major hit and tourism is likely to be reduced for some time. They may find it necessary to reduce fees.
"Or, they may lower the upfront room rate to make the room appear to cost less, but keep the fee (or even raise it) to compensate for the lower upfront rate. Since the ""resort fee"" is a shady practice to begin with, I would expect the hotels that charge it now to keep charging it even if they lower their rates after the lockdown. The current loss of business is not going to make the shady hotels act more honestly. It is more likely to make them continue (or even add to) their shady practices to make up for lost profits. Watch for additional fees (staff sanitizing fee, anyone?) from the greedy."
"Does anyone know if there is a list of hotels that ARE open right now? Or is that something one determines by trial and error?Tonight I happened to walk by the hotel formerly known as the Beekman Tower, now after renovations an extended stay whose name I can't remember. Lights were on and I saw someone at the reception desk and assumed was still open. Can see how a place like that might appeal to someone here for crisis work -- not far from a number of hospitals, etc and UN. Though I guess I was still a bit surprised to see it open.Saw something in paper about a doctor who came down from somewhere in New England to help in critical care at Bellevue, where he trained many years ago.Called the Four Seasons, as had heard about their offer to house medical personnel. Hotel said sorry rooms could only be arranged thru AMA or some other medical association. NY Times followed up on this and was told details/processes were yet to be worked out, so actually nobody could stay there yet.Sounds as messed up as medical supply requisitioning. But that doc did find another place to stay -- perhaps the hospitals are helping sort this stuff out. I imagine there are other people who must come here for one reason or another and it got me thinking about what places are still open."
"QQ2: Yes.If you search the major aggregator sites—but check “Hotels Available Only”—the sort will likely be what you want (subject to delays of hotel reports to that site and subsequent changes). Using the list, make your choices—then call hotel off-site and on-property to confirm in uncertain times.Edited: 9:17 am, April 04, 2020 "
"I don't think most hotels call this a ""resort fee"" in NYC. They call it a service charge or facility fee.Kimpton Hotels have been doing this a very very long time, this isn't news. I think they've been doing it for many years.I think obsessing about this is weird, the bottom line is what matters, not whether there is a ""resort fee"" or not. It makes no sense to only pick hotels without ""resort fees"" if they charge $75 more a night anyway. I guess if this is really important to you to ""punish"" hotels who have it and refuse to stay there, sure, I can understand that point. But a lot of people just don't seem to understand basic math, that it's the total that matters. But this seems to be some kind of hobby to keep this list. Trying to only book hotels like that may be cutting off your nose to spite your face, as they say."
I heard the Stoller Report on the radio this morning and it was mentioned the current NYC hotel occupancy rate is 18%. Several are allowing medical people to stay free of charge.
"""I heard the Stoller Report on the radio this morning and it was mentioned the current NYC hotel occupancy rate is 18%.""Probably what they should be doing. As mentioned before this is kinda like having a war going on an invisible one."
"95. Fox notes: ""The current NYC hotel occupancy rate is 18%.

One hotel is The Four Seasons (uptown), whose site notes:""Given the finite number of accommodations and the immense demand and scale of the health crisis, we have partnered with select hospitals and medical associations, who will manage the reservations process directly with their staff and members. Four Seasons Hotel New York is unfortunately not able to take any reservations directly from individuals and we do apologize in advance.""With all adjusting to an understandable administrative step, the Four Seasons has begun and is housing such staff through the process.Edited: 8:28 pm, April 04, 2020 "

It is disappointing that the individual from Washington, DC failed to disclosure the litigation on resort fees brought by the DC Attorney General (local) there, who does not treat resort fees as a “hobby”.[One irony of that litigation is 100% of 8 Kimpton (mentioned in the post) DC l properties have resort fees but Kimpton is NOT a party—while none of the 30 Marriott family brand properties there has a resort fee, but Marriott IS a party. In Manhattan, some Marriott family brands have resort fees, but over 40 of Marriott family brand properties do not.]The post following this one will contain references concerning the DC litigation.3. The negativity of Post 92 is disheartening and unnecessary generally, but especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and what it means for NYC."

"So there us no misunderstanding about the feature of objectivity throughout the history of the thread, the subject was worth repeating in the introduction in Post 1 here, including a fair statement of both the “hotel” and the “consumer” perspective on resort fees:“Further discussion of resort fees is provided at https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763… An objective approach to the general subject of resort fees is described in Post 52 there, and at https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763…”Edited: 12:29 am, April 06, 2020 "

">>>With all adjusting to an understandable administrative step, the Four Seasons has begun and is housing such staff through the process<<<Indeed they have, and it’s actually much much more than what it appears on the surface. This is a piece of business brilliance and it has the fingerprints of the likes of Isadore Sharp and Christian Clerc all over it. It’s the Triple Crown of business decisions; the foresight, the strategy, and the bravery to act on it, ahead of other notable hotels. 1. Help the community and those who are in desperate need of support. Right off the bat, it’s a positive. 2. By ensuring they have local government support to offer ‘sole use’ accommodation services to emergency and medical staff, they can’t be seconded for use as a hospital or shelter for the homeless. Another positive. 3. It keeps their essential/core staff employed throughout this terrible circumstance. Another positive. 4. Almost zero negative association/connotation afterwards. It isn’t just exclusive to Four Seasons in NYC, there are several Four Seasons globally, who have made this decision."

"This may help avoid confusion between two hotels using the term ""Night"": one hotel DID (but no longer) use(s) the name, while the other one now DOES use the name. 1. Post 113 states: ""The Night Hotel is now the OYO Times Square. It continues the policy of a resort fee."" This is correct. The OYO address is 157 West 47th Street. (For clarification, the full former title was ""Night Times Square""--now not in use). The policy of resort fee continues as noted in Post 113.2. A second hotel has the current title of ""Night Hotel by SB at Times Square"", 132 West 45th Street. The former title was ""Night Hotel Theater District by SB Hotels, Times Square"".

"Ted T:Your comment is very helpful.As you noted, the New Yorker usually has a resort fee.For dates the hotel is available for now until at least December, the website that follows shows a resort fee:https:/…bookPerhaps the hotel made the adjustment separate from the online display, or a different website is involved. (It would be in their interest to reflect such change on line.)If you would like, please let us know if a different website is involved, if your initial booking contained the fee, or if the hotel explained the adjustment. The New Yorker is a large property, and so many visitors will appreciate what you may wish to add.Thank you.Edited: 10:12 am, June 27, 2020 "
"Gee, I hadn't heard the Omni Berkshire Place had closed for good. That's an old-time classic and am sorry to see it go. It was apparently designed by the same team that designed Grand Central Terminal and said to be where Rodgers & Hammerstein write ""Oklahoma."" Under the recent midtown rezoning plan it is eligible to be converted to office space, so wonder if they will do something like that with it.I was also interested to read that hotel occupancy rates in Manhattan have risen to the mid-40% range, quite an improvement to the 15% of early lockdown days.Edited: 2:19 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"The New Yorker doesn't have a facility fee if you book on their own website which is this (NOT the Wyndam website).https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/offers/They also cut the rate a lot, at least in early September when I checked (9/7, I think that's the holiday).It probably depends on the dates, that's all. They do show it on that website in August. They also don't show it on 10/26, for example. Maybe it's the early days in the week that are deals, it just varies.They don't call it a ""resort fee"", anyway, it's called a facility fee by most hotels in NY. I don't think hotels ever call it a resort fee when it isn't a resort, that doesn't really make sense."
"Christina: your point is very helpful:If we wish to possibly avoid facility fees and/or get the best availability and rate, it is good to go beyond an aggregator display—and check not just the chain brand family website, but the one for the specific property.Thank you.Edited: 5:58 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"In Post 142, Christina noted:""They don't call it a ""resort fee"", anyway, it's called a facility fee by most hotels in NY. I don't think hotels ever call it a resort fee when it isn't a resort, that doesn't really make sense.""Christina makes the point that if a hotel is not a resort, it does not make sense to call the fee a resort fee. (In addition, many visitors do not know that a majority of Manhattan ""resort fee"" hotels do not provide complimentary coffee service as standard in the rooms.) Christina is correct that not all hotels use the term ""resort fee"". Some examples are:Hotel, East 55th Street, ""residential fee""Hotel, West 41st Street, ""curation fee""Hotel, West 41st Street, ""resort fee""Hotel, East 32nd Street, ""service fee""Hotel, Greenwich Street, ""facilities fee""Hotel, West 40th Street, ""cleaning fee"" Whatever the term, it indicates a fee not required by law, which in NYC is taxed at a different and lower rate than the room rate.Care should be taken to determine whether a fee is per room or per person, per stay or per night, before tax or after tax, and that all terms are conspicuously disclosed. (As one example, at the WestHouse Hotel: what is the """"resident's fee"" for 2 parents and 2 children, ages 15 and 16 in 1 room, arriving Friday and departing Sunday (2 nights))?Edited: 9:12 pm, June 27, 2020 "
