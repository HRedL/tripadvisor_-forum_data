"Hi.I am flying to the Philippines soon via Bejing and then Singapore. Currently there is a travel ban on flights from China due to coronavirus and so i am looking to book some new flights. My insurance will not cover any cancellations due to epidemic, i am hoping to only have to book outbound flights in the hope that travel bans will be lifted in 4 months when i return. Does anyone know if AirChina automatically cancels your return flight if you do not board your outgoing flight? I have emailed them and tried calling but have not got very far.thanks"
"Yes, flights must be flown in order."
"You must fly the outbound to avoid the inbound being cancelled if it's all booked as a single, return ticket.Air China are offering full refunds at the moment, including for the return ticket. I think you either have to take the refund from Air China and then buy a new ticket with a different airline to get to the Philippines, and include the return when you do that, or cancel the whole trip.Unfortunately, prices are likely to be higher now. I can think of no way round that, unfortunately. Your insurer won't help because as far as they're concerned your destination is the Philippines and you are perfectly at liberty to fly there still. Which airline you chose to book and the route was up to you. It's just very unfortunate timing.SWT"
"Before you take matters into your own hands and buy new tickets, are you sure that Air China will not reroute you? They are part of Star Alliance so may be able to arrange flights with one of their alliance partners that would not involve you transiting China. And they will almost certainly offer this if they cancel flight(s) themselves. Call them.Edited: 10:27 am, February 14, 2020 "
OP has not stated that her current flights were actually cancelled. It appears that is not the case yet?
"Is your flight cancelled?According to their website:""Route from Mainland China to Singapore: Beijing-Singapore flights CA969 from February 11 to February 29, 2020 and Singapore-Beijing CA970 from February 12 to March 1, 2020 are canceled.""https://www.airchina.co.uk/GB/GB/info/news/â€¦"
"I am not familiar with UK trip insurance policies, and exclusions for cancellations that are ""epidemic"" related are not, in my experience, common in the US, but if I were you I would read those policy provisions very very carefully, call the insurance company, and, if necessary, talk with someone knowledgeable about this type of insurance, like a lawyer.In other words, does the exclusion preclude you from collecting if YOU get sick in an epidemic, does it preclude you from collecting if YOU don't get sick but an airline cancels your flight for reasons that may or may not be related to an epidemic, does it preclude you from collecting if you aren't sick and there isn't an epidemic now but there was one a month or so ago and people are still afraid to travel so airlines and cruise lines are still cancelling flights and cruises simply because of a big drop in business?"
