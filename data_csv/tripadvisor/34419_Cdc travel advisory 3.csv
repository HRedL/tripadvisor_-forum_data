"Hello, I just saw that the CDC put the Virgin Island under 3 avoid non necessary travel. Do you still plan to go? Is this changing your plans?"
"I could go into details about CDC's Level 3 assessment of specifically the US Virgin Islands but the overall world map and list of ""high"" and ""moderate"" countries puts it into easily readable perspective:https:/â€¦map-and-travel-notices.html"
"To the O.P. am I missing something here? The entire U.S. is under the same level 3 advisory to avoid unnecessary travel and unless you are going to a very small list of countries that really don't want to have visitors almost the entire world is under CDC level 3 advisory. Wear a mask, wash your hands, maintain social distancing - please.Edited: 5:55 am, August 11, 2020 "
