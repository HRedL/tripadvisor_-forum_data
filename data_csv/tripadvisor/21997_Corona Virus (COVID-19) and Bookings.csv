"Hi TripAdvisor -I can't see any information regarding bookings made through TripAdvisor, but it looks like Guatemala, where I have my month-long rental for April, is closing its borders to US citizens. Can you please advise? Best,David"

"I agree. TA is the last place I'd look for information at this time. Check your government's sites. Look at the government of your destination, and expect to not be going at all."
We are both over 70 and can we book at a latter date
"You’d need to contact whoever you’ve booked with, or at least intend to book with. You don’t book anything with Tripadvisor, all bookings through this website are made on other websites."
"Original question was regarding refunds for bookings that need to be canceled. I saw that actually TripAdvisor's company, FlipKey is the one to follow up with: https://helpcenter.flipkey.com/faq/view/Abou…Regarding peoples' opinions on how to handle the virus - well that matters where each individual gets their info, how susceptible they are to the virus, and their individual level of risk tolerance. If I were over 70 and still wanted to live, I'd probably rent a place in the country and start planting a garden."
"Hello, re COVID 19 - I booked a condo in Montreal for this week. I have advised the owner and reached out to discuss any reimbursement. I was advised to reach out to Trip Advisor.; tried calling in but could not reach a live body. What is Trip Advisor doing for people who need to cancel due to the crisis we are currently in. Crazy that I am getting the run around in times like this. I will reach out to the owner again but suspect that I will be told to reach out to Trip Advisor. Should I be cancel my booking online (not sure what to do and no one to ask. THanks"

"Evelyn ~Is your condo rental in Montréal legal? Many are not.The reason that the owner wants you to cancel the booking is that you will be charged the cancellation fee. If he cancels the booking he will be charged the cancellation fee. However, it is you who wishes to cancel the booking, so you will be the one who needs to cancel.You can open this link: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12…You can use the contact template linked in #2 to write to TA Staff.You can use the email address linked in #5. Make sure you include the vacation rental listing number so that TA know which property you are talking about.You can make your enquiry about a refund by either of those methods."
I have a booking in a holiday villa for September what happens if we have to cancel due to Covid-19 do we get our deposit back. Full payment is due by End of July but obviously don’t want to pay this if holiday won’t be going ahead
Who did you book through?
"If you as a guest cancel, you will pay a penalty. If the owner cancels they pay a penalty. They will want you to cancel and perhaps tell you to do so.However, if the virus does not allow them to host guests, if their country is behind closed borders for leisure/tourist travel, they will have to cancel it. As well, you need to read the Terms and Conditions of their cancellation policy.Here is the page for guest cancellations with Holiday Lettings. Flipkey will be very similar: https://help.holidaylettings.co.uk/articles/…and for owner cancellations: https:/…Canceling-a-bookingFinding the owner's cancellation policy: https://help.holidaylettings.co.uk/faq/view/…∞∞Flipkey's policy for a guest cancelling is on this page: https:/…Cancelling-a-bookingand if the owner cancels a booking: https:/…Edit-Cancel-booking"
