"Hi All, There seems to be a lot of angry posts over swine flu here of late. Lets take a step back. They way I see it, there a few things going on here:1. Individuals and families are legitimately concerned for their health.2. Governments and health officials want to make sure they respond quickly to this issue, and not be seen as ignoring a potentially dangerous issue.3. The media are hyping this story .... fear sells. However, once you get past the hype one gain a lot of the cold facts on this issue from a variety of sources. That is a powerful thing.4. There are small pockets of swine flu that are occurring over a wide geographic area. This in fact means with have met the geographical quotient of the pandemic definition. Now the question is are we at epidemic levels in any of the pockets. An epidemic is wide spread with many people getting sick. We are of course wide spread, but I don't think the numbers dictate ""many people"" yet. However it is entirally possible it will, in my opinion.This is just my two cents. If you would like to respond, please do so, but lets keep this thread calm.-Jay"
bump?
"I agree, I really want to go, but now my boyfriend doesn't want to for fear he'll get sick or we'll bring it home to the kids. We have the tamiflu, just in case we start to get symptoms, and hand sanitizer etc. I'm so dissapointed."

New 'swine flu' cases bring Canadian total to 34…msn.ctv.ca/abc/home/contentposting.aspx…(last night there were only at 19 - if we hit 38 numbers will have doubled in 24 hours....watching clock and reports)
8 people every month are killed by lightning strikes in the USA.8 people confirmed killed by swine flu worldwide out of a population of nearly 7 billion. That's about 1 in a billion.I'll take my chances.
"If you ask me it's just an over hype to sell Tami flu and to push the flu vaccine. But it's worthless due to the fact that there are so many strains. So fuggedaboudit, drink tequila. Your immune system will do fine. The odds are, you'll probably win the lottery before you get the swine flu."
"This is crazy,, there are people dying out there"
"I hear you. We want to go so bad, well I do and I think my husband is backing down. We just dont want to get down there and it be empty. We also dont want to have problems at the airports. But I to am so disappointed :("

Some may have fallen ill before the first Mexicans did.www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,518572,00.html"
"I know the cruise lines are concerned with the safety of their passengers, but I believe this whole thing has gone a little overboard. (no pun intended)I was looking forward to my beach break in Cozumel, and I found out yesterday that the port is being cancelled. This is even though no cases have been reported on the island.For me, this is just a small inconvenience, but I feel horrible for those of you who depend on the tourism industry.I will keep my fingers crossed that some sort of reason prevails.

Maybe its just me but it still seems like a very small amount of cases..But with all the scare it seems like it wont last long.
"Flu Fighters Warn Against Complacency, Seek Clues[SNIPPED...] MEXICO CITY — The leader of an international team helping Mexico face down the swine flu outbreak said it should soon learn whether the epidemic is really stabilizing in Mexico, but that many key questions about how the disease kills still need to be answered.Dr. Steve Waterman, the head of a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also warned against taking false comfort from the fact that only one person has died outside Mexico, saying more deaths are likely as the epidemic evolves.www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,518685,00.html "
"THanks for a calm post. Facts are important. However, the name calling in other posts do not help. I understand the uncertainty ! I am booked June 1 to Coz and am watching to see what happens. "
"The general feeling now seems to be that this does not have the earmarks of a truly deadly outbreak. First it seems that most of the cases that were suspected in Mexico have turned out to be just the regular old flu (now this may not be a good thing since you could defintiely die from the regular flu). But it is important to point out that when the confirmed cases double it is because they are getting around to testing old samples (which as stated have turned out to be 50% ""regular"" flu). There is the possibility that this strain could mutate (as happened in 1918) but restricting travel to Mexico at this point is entirely useless to stop this from happening. It is just as likely to mutate in the US or anywhere else where they've already got it. Yeah it sucks to get the flu but it is not ebola. I am going to talk to my dr on Monday and hopefully be sitting on the beach this time next week."

"Jay, I don't think we even needed yet another ""swine flu"" thread! You just added to all the rest.Lori, you left Tennessee out"
"I guess this thread has become an information sharing thread, which is a good thing. I hope this has been helpful. I am concerned that swine flu is spreading over the US, but at least it does not have a high mortality rate, yet.-Jay"
"Well lets keep this thread alive awhile longer, apparently tarabull needs something to keep reporting to...."
"I just returned last night and I am happy to report that my sister and I are flu free, so far. We took precautions while in Cancun by washing hands frequently and using a lot of hand sanitizer. We also avoided crowded place and didn't go downtown, etc. We had a wonderful time and I will be posting a full trip report shortly. The hotel (Cancun Palace) was empty!"
"I am not so much concerned I will get the flu from traveling to Mexico. What I am concerned about mostly is the headaches and the airlines, possibility of quarantine, etc. My friend returned from Mexico with her two friends last week when this all went down. When they landed in the US, they were on the plane with the CDC interviewing them and asking them all sorts of questions. Everyone on that plane could not leave until they were done and they have to register with the CDC. I am a nurse and my friend and her two friends are as well. The CDC told them they needed to call their employer and let them know of possible exposure. (yes there was someone on the plane that was having ""flu like"" symptoms and wearing a mask) My friend cannot work for 5 days and the other two for a week.As a RN, not only is it a bummer to have to take more time off and if you are per-diem paid, you do not get paid but you are also putting your patients that are already sick in jeopardy. That is something I cannot take the risk if there could be the slighest possiblity of getting exposed to the swine flu while traveling. How could I risk my career and the lifes of other people?I think there is a higher risk for healthcare workers going back to a care for patients. I work in critical care and also the surgical critical care....too much of a risk. They do not like us working when we have a cold in the surgical unit never mind the possible flu!"
"I heard the same thing from someone at UTMB -- the threat of quarrantine is far more serious right now than the threat of illness.For myself and my family, the threat is not quite so great, but it is one of the factors we are weighing. My wife's classes end this week (she has to turn in her grades on Thursday), so she can stay with kids if need be. I am not in a close-contact position, so I don't pose a huge threat to my coworkers.As it stands, we're still on for leaving this Sunday, but we're still waiting until Thursday to make a final decision."
"When we left yesterday, at CUN we had to complete a form about our health and then have our temperature taken. When we ""passed"" we were able to check in. The people said that they did have sick people come through...but we don't know what happened to them if they were stopped. There were only a couple of people on our flight wearing masks...and I hope that they weren't sick. When we got off the plane they just handed us a flyer from the CDC describing the symptoms and then we were on our way. None of the ""screening"" took too long...maybe an extra 10 minutes... but I also don't know if it helped."
All i can say from having it is that there is alot more people that have this then reported. Both me and my friend ended up with it and toughed it out for are last 2 nights in mexico because we just wanted to get home. When we arrived in Canada there were no precautions being done at the airport. We just walked straight in and threw customs and got are luggage. Then when home doctors say they want nothing to do with you unless you have breathing problems. If this is the case then where are they getting their numbers from?
"I honestly doubt that the tracking figures are meant to tell the public about the severity of the outbreak, though that is how they are reported to us.Those tracking figures, even with a limited population, give epidemioligists clues as to where the flu is on its life cycle. It is not critical to have exact figures -- the growth rate alone tells volumes. When it is possible to tell where along the curve the epidemic lies, it is possible to predict, with decent accuracy, as to how bad the outbreak will become. This, in turn, provides data with which to make decisions on vaccine production, etc.We are still very, very early in the data collection period, so I honestly wouldn't read all that much into the official figures yet, unless there is an alarming rate of death or serious hospitalization emerging."
"mike_in_tx, You make some great points. I am not sure how accurate we can predict the severity and spread growth of pandemics yet. The last pandemic we had (early 1900s?) waned off a lot during the summer, so much so they thought it had been beaten, to only come back the next winter to kill many thousands more. Viri mutate at a fast rate, and it is hard to predict how various human populations well respond as viri change.-Jay"
"vancity,If you were not diagnosed then you didn't have it! "
"Here's some food for thought...In the UK, the BBC news report total confirmed cases worldwide of ~1600However, many reports have confirmed that by the time the results of a case are confirmed, the person has made a full recovery or well on their way to a full recovery because it can take 5, 7, 10 days or sometimes longer for the labs to process.So, if ~1600 HAVE been infected, how many STILL have it?far less than ~1600 I suspect..."
"I'd think the opposite -- probably much more. The CDC and WHO aren't even trying to track every single incident that exists on the planet. They are simply relaying reported figures from people who have been specifically tested.This thing is going to get bigger. The thing is, so what? If/when the strain mutates into something worse, then we have something to worry about. until then, it's just a golden opportunity to track a virus as it comes into existence. Scientists have never had such an opportunity before."
"I wasnt diagnosed because no doctor wants to see you here if you just have ""signs"" of it. They just say stay inside and treat it like a normal flu. After talking to a Nurse she said i had it 100% so i am thinking there is probly thousands of people that are in the same situation. Just makes me think that the numbers they report on the news are much lower then what they actually are."
