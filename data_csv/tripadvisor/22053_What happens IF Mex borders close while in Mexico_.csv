I’m not looking for opinions on Covid19. But factual info of what could happen if they close down borders while we are here in Puerto Vallarta. I know Europe borders closing did not mean that US citizens could not come home. So trying to find the truth amongst so much going on. Tia
"So far there has been no serious discussion of keeping US citizens from returning home. Will you be able to find a flight? That's the question. All the airlines are cutting flights and, my crystal ball is fuzzy on this, if people aren't traveling to vacation destinations like PV I'd think flights might become fewer and fewer. The only real discussion about closing the border with Mexico seems to involve immediately returning migrants entering illegally or asylum seekers. The rationale is that keeping them penned up in detention facilities pending court proceedings is an invitation for mass Corona infections in those ""camps""."
"Do you mean Mexico closing its border? Or the US closing their border?What's is more likely to affect you is about flights and airports, assuming you will travel by air.Right now there are people from Canada at risk of being stuck in PV because of airlines cancelling their flights.I don't think people can give you ""factual info"" of what might happen in the future."
"Nothing has been published about it, so there are no facts to give. I feel secure in saying that Mexico is not going to keep you against your wishes. What if they closed the border, then had all these tourists who have ran out of money to stay somewhere? Not to mention they will have their hands full with providing healthcare for their citizens, so they aren't going want to add more people to their hospitals. These are not problems they want.  I feel pretty sure that's why they closed their border to Guatemala. So I wouldn't worry about being stuck there unless the US closes it's border with Mexico."
There was just an announcement that the US - Canada border is closing to non-essential travel. I am in Canada & not heard if the the US - Mexico border will but shut as well to non-essential travel. The statement said supply chain trade would not be affected but tourist & shopping trips would be stopped.
Here you go Kansas: https:/…
"I think the big question is.... will the airlines be running? Will they be ordered to stop for a few weeks.... They all could be halted at any point for a period of time. As things are evolving and changing by the minute, no one can predict the future. At the moment there are date / time limits on repatriation on some airlines. I would call your airline. It’s a good place to start. But even then- it’s only “up to the minute you call.” They can’t really predict what will happen either. It could all change the minute you hang up on your phone call."
"The border closures allow people to return home. Definitely the issue is how you would find a flight -I would worry about getting stranded. Right now, there are loads of people who are reportedly being stranded as airlines across EU, Europe, South America suspend flights for the coming weeks.Edited: 1:06 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"""Call your airline"" doesn't work very well right now. People are reporting 6 hours wait times, calls being dropped after being on the line for hours, etc. Some reported better luck using websites, twitter, etc.If you are not already in Vallarta, going there now for a vacation seems foolhardy. Not a direct ""opinion"" about covid, rather a reality check of the unpredictability of closures, cancellations, limitations in the future. Unless you are in a position you could stay for a month or two (which I would be willing to do if I could) you need to face the reality that you could be stuck or end up with limited or expensive options to return."
Mexico heath ministrie said it will not close the border.. Trump wants the border closed for people who cross illegally... My understanding they still will let us and permanent residents cross.

"“Call your airline” has worked perfectly for me. No wait. Might be dependent on what time of day you call or what airline you are calling. At any rate, I’d start with your airline. Call, email, whatever it takes to get the assurance you need (or not) in regarding traveling to Vallarta."
"What airline had no wait, Deana?"
"I called Delta today at 8am. Waited 20 min.. She stated that inbound flights are rinning at about 40% capicity, but outbound flights are full. She suspects that the number of inbound flights will be reduced later this week."
"Suze.... I only use Alaska Airlines and you know that answer, lol. I just don’t have very much of a wait. Longest was 3 minutes. Everyone has a different airline, they call at different times of day, it also depends on the volume of calls at the time you call - all of it. And yes, I’ve called a few times in the last couple of days and called just now and I got right in after a minute wait."
"No, I didn't know you only use Alaska Airline. How in the world would I know something like that? That's great you are having no problems reaching an airline. Can you at least understand that other people are having problems with this?I waited for 1/2 hour last week without reaching anyone but was able to cancel/credit my plane ticket for next week online instead.Edited: 5:11 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Better yet, back to the title of this thread. IF Mex borders close while you are in Mexico, you aren't going to get through to the airlines on the phone in a minute or two."
I wonder if Heather is in Puerto Vallarta now or still thinking about whether to go or not? We haven't heard back from her on this thread.

"We are in Nuevo Vallarta, and have been for six weeks, with a return flight to Canada scheduled for April 1. We are not trying to change our tickets and have hunkered down right where we are. We have already found a casita if we cannot fly home on the first. At the present time, we are fortunate to be in a single-family house in a small area. We are also fortunate to be able to stay here indefinitely with being retired and no dire need to return home. We felt it safer to just stay put and avoid the airport at this time."
"Yeah things are getting complicated - now even non-essential travel between the US and Canada is being restricted. First time I can remember that happening and I'm old - lol. I think you probably made a good decision - hard to say since I don't know your medical situation. I do know it's expensive and out-of-pocket in PV but the health care at home looks like it could get iffy, too. In any case, best move it probably to avoid airports and airplanes in any case. Settle in and try and enjoy the warm weather - it's rainy, windy and turning to snow in Denver - brrrr. I'm going to venture out for Safeway's first ""senior hours"" opening today - letting us old geezers get a shot early before the masses pick the stores clean. God bless them."
"Fred: That is very considerate of your Safeway!Karen: Given your flexibility, I think you made the right decision. For the first time in ages we did not have a spring flight back to Canada booked. We are very fortunate to have the option of not travelling."
"Our situation is strikingly similar to Karen's, as we are also from Sylvan Lake (Michigan, not Canada) and have been ""snow birding"" in the Riviera Nayarit (San Pancho, not Nuevo Vallarta) since mid-Jan. We were scheduled to leave on April 2 but have decided to cancel and remain in San Pancho, as the owner of our house said we could stay for as long as necessary. Other than a few restaurants closing, along with the children's community center and weekly farmers market, everything else seems the same here. Are we worried that things may worsen in PV, and by extension here in SP? And that we may be stuck here for who knows how long? For sure, but we are much more concerned about the exposure involved with a four hour plane ride and standing in lines at departing and arriving airports.Locally sourced food will continue to be available here and we have a beautiful, wide open beach to enjoy. Moreover, we have established a network of wonderful friends (locals and gringos) who take care of each other. Now that we have made our decision to stay, our stress level has gone down and we try to enjoy each and every day here in this very special little pueblo, while adhering to the basic rues of ""social distancing."" Did we make the right decision? Time will tell but it was done thoughtfully and in consultation with family and others. Everyone's situation is unique and I don't think a blanket ""You should go"" or ""You should stay"" edict from forum folks is appropriate or helpful."
"If your in mexico I think you can walk thru the san ysidro border to get home from Tijuana.. My friend just did that a few hours ago.. Because it was essential for him to go home .. But I dont know how much time people have to Cross I know walking across for us citizens is semi ok right now or maybe not... Have not talked to my other friend who is also down in Tijuana to see if he can Cross yet so one made it back around 9:30pm post.. Have not heard from my, other friend.. You might be able to walk across or drive across some borders.. But they might be taking temperature.."
"If you are looking to get to the US (possibly even Canada) and your airline suspends service, you can take a flight from PVR to the Mexican/US border via a Mexican airline and walk across the border. For example, PVR to Juarez (CJS), then walk across the border in to El Paso, TX. PVR to Tijuana (TIJ), then walk across the border to San Diego. PVR to Monterrey, (MTY) (via Mexico City) with a bus/cab to the border at Loredo, McAllen or Brownsville, Texas. And, while US and Canadian Airlines may suspend service to Puerto Vallarta, they may still be offering flight to US and Canadian cities out of Mexico City, (MEX) . Of course, this all assumes that the US and Canadian governments will not close the border to their own citizens."
"3 hours minnimum crossing from TJ by foot, probably longer with the surge of people crossing."
If I was in Tijuana I would wait in the long line if I am to able to Cross and get back to the united states. I just read on cnbc news that on Friday that Trump is going to have a restriction on crossing the border meaning he will have details on it later on Friday They say it might be similar to canada. So I'm guessing us citizens can still come in the states for now  but don't know how long that will be... Flights into the united states from mexico don't know how that's going to work
"There are two (2) entries in to the US in Tijuana. The first one is the traditional one that leads to San Ysidro. The other is the Cross Border Xpress Sky Bridge, from the airport. After your flight arrives, collect your bags and make your way to the Cross Border Xpress Sky Bridge. Have your documents ready. Go to the US immigration desk. You will walk across the bridge in to the US and arrive in the US near Otay Mesa. There will be plenty of taxis, shuttles and buses there as well as a passenger pick-up area.Edited: 9:47 am, March 20, 2020 "
Well in Tijuana there is those two entries you just said.. But there is also otay entry seperate from the cbx bridge and also pedwest which is a newer entry been open for a few years now.. But I don't know if they closed some and just have one or two open for the time being.. It's because I have not been there for about 2 weeks.
"Anyone who is considering staying in Mexico should also read and then think about the implications of the posts/threads about experiences with being very sick and needing critical care within the Mexican hospital system. In particular, they should consider the high costs in the multiple thousands of US dollars that people are expected to pay up front by credit card If they are hospitalized; as I understand what people are posting about the fine print in their travel insurance policies, it is difficult if not impossible to get insurance coverage for hospitalization costs associated with a pandemic.Edited: 10:14 am, March 20, 2020 "
Honduras has closed their borders and airports. All tourists are trapped for the foreseeable future. So have some countries in Europe. In order to try and control this virus drastic steps may happen.
The border is now closed in both directions to non essential travel.https:/…
Yes it's close but it is letting us citizens with the documents back in.. So if you don't have your passport you might be stuck
"Saw the OP on the Cabo forum, and yes it sounds like they travelled regardless. Disappointing."
really hope she writes a trip report-----would love to know it went
I wonder if they went to Cabo or PV... it was never clear. Heather posted on both forums as if she were going to each.
"A couple of Heathers’ posts were on the 16th, Cabo and PV. This one states she’s “leaving on “Saturday.” So I don’t think she goes until tomorrow. https:/…106062145(check history)Edited: 3:33 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Oh- well ok, wherever she is (Hi Heather), if you are reading this we hope you are safe. We haven’t heard from you in awhile, and as you can see there are many who care. —————————We have friends that are in Hawaii right now trying to get a red eye out tonight. They are a family of four and finally they realize the sense of urgency is now, and are cutting their vacation short.Edited: 3:58 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"My second friend just cross san ysidro border today with no issue showed his passport and crossed.. I don't know if they took his tempture or not.i mean Cross into the united statesEdited: 5:27 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"As long as your an American Citizen you’ll be allowed back in, that isn’t an issue at all. If your stuck somewhere in North or South America the State department will work to get you back in. Had a buddy decide to head to Cabo today and flight was empty, one other couple on the flight and that was it. Airport was empty in Cabo and he said about 10 of the villas out of 30 were occupied (Not a hotel, just villas). He’s lucky enough to have the resources that if he needs to get back and airlines are shut down that he can afford other means. Probably not the most ideal situation but wanted to get away from this madness."
"ABigB927 - Your buddy isn't getting away from anything; the virus is spreading in Mexico now and things are shutting down. Anybody who travels is being extremely foolish. Tourists are getting stranded in many countries and it could be weeks, if not months, before their governments are able to rescue them."
"My dad is 94 years ld & my brother issueig trough Stege IV i,iver & colon cancer - worst case scenario, will i be able to get back to the US for god forbid funeral(s)>"
"@poster50 if your a us citizen or, permanent resident. You may enter the us with the valid documents like passport"
"We Canadians, like the Americans, if you are a citizen or permanent resident of Canada, you will NOT be denied entry coming back from Mexico, Europe, or USA unless you show signs of Covid19."
"Hi Lopo amiga: (post 50).There are no gatherings allowed right now, even funerals. Anywhere in the world. If you believe in the afterlife, which I know you do, your loved ones will be lifted up to G_d as easily here as in New York.For sure, they will have our love and prayers."
"Lopo, the problem will be how do you get back. Most airlines have suspended flights from PV. Maybe you could get to Mexico City on one of the National carriers then get a flight? I will be looking into those kinds of flights soon as I will eventually have to go back to work. I am working from home for the next month for sure. All nonessential business has been shut down in NYC, so I think it may be hard to find a flight from PV."
"Post #53--wrong information. From the Diocese of Oakland:""The Diocese of Oakland is working with local funeral services and cemeteries to provide pastoral ministry to families, while also cooperating with public health officials to slow down the spread of coronavirus. Priests will continue to provide the Rite of Committal of the body at the cemetery, with no more than 10 individuals present. All CDC guidelines regarding social distancing and hygiene will be observed. A proper Funeral Mass may be celebrated at a later date in the parish church, after public health officials have lifted restrictions on public gatherings.""Across the Bay, in San Francisco, funeral homes are exempt from the shelter-in-place order, but social distancing must be maintained.Funeral services are exempt in the States of Illinois and Texas with social distancing either recommended or required.I could spend more time gathering facts proving that your statement is incorrect, but why bother? If you have any authorities evidencing that funeral services are not allowed, please post them."
"Someone above mentioned Lopo might be from New York State. Funerals were banned for a bit, but now immediate families can attend: https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/03…"
"By the time you include the priest and some folks to lower the coffin, the quota of 10 is pretty quickly breached. The person had crappy information about no funerals but in any case it’s obvious any funeral wouldn’t be all that normal. The original question I think was about getting home in the unfortunate event someone close passed, and that for the time being won’t be a major problem. However, It will likely change more this week."
"MAW0101,Here in the US coffins are lowered 99.9% of the time by cemetery employees, not family members. And those employees can remain at a safe distance from grieving family members before lowering the casket, after the family members have walked back to their cars. Anyway....¡Diviertanse!"
"In CT, Last Rites were given over the phone:https:/…index.html"
UK still allowing funerals at the moment.just for information no criticism on statements of none allowed anywhere.
