"Hi, Me and my husband are planning to visit Amsterdam for 2 nights in October, Saturday-Monday. It's the first city in our Amsterdam-Bruges-Paris holiday. We've never been to Amsterdam, and after research realised it's quite expensive hotel price wise. I have tried to look up something that's not too far away from the centre that's relatively cheap (<£100/night). Would like to keep as much spending money as possible rather than on a hotel. I've looked up Hotel2Stay and Lloyd Hotel, they both seem to have good reviews. Is there any other recommendations people have or who have stayed in these hotels? We'd be arriving by flight after noon on the Saturday, and was gonna leave at noon on the train to Bruges."
"Amsterdam is an expensive city for hotels, no question. You are also making matters worse by staying on a Saturday night which, given the number of weekend visitors from nearby countries, is by far the most expensive night of the week.Both the hotels you mention are a fair bit from the centre and we ALWAYS advise people to stay centrally.You do not give us your exact dates which we need to give you meaningful advice but if I put a random October weekend (13th to 15th) in I see a 4* 90% recommended hotel, probably the Hotel Vondel, in the Vondelpark area for 121 euro which would work out at 145 euro per night (120 pounds) after taxes and fees. That is what I would go for personally. The extra cost of the room would be more than made up for by the cost of transport and loss of time that staying in one of your suggested hotels would entail."
"Thanks for your reply! We have no choice on the days we stay due to the annual leave I had to take for my work and the flights etc, as I do realise weekend trips to the city are popular, but nothing I can do about that unfortunately. The dates are 6th-8th October. I will look up that hotel, thanks for the recommendation! I was also under the impression that no matter where I stayed in the city I would still need to use public transport a lot to see the sights as they see are spread out? So I thought i would be spending money on that anyway?"
Amsterdam is eminently walkable and the center is very compact. In our 4 visits we have not used a Tram or any public transport as we have preferred to walk. In a 2 day stay you should not be using transport unless you have an issue with walking. Enjoy your trip.Have you explored the Train option to come to Amsterdam from the UK?.
"It's far quicker to get the plane from Scotland, where we live, to Amsterdam than multiple trains down to and from London (I imagine). I'll need to look at more itineraries, I was under the impression from looking at a few attraction maps that you couldn't walk to them all. I'm obviously wrong so I'll need to go back and look at hotel areas now Lol Thanks for your reply."
Be careful with the Lloyd hotel. It has rooms that range from 1* to 5* Their cheapest rooms have no en suite and their next level up has an open bathroom and I mean really open. Location is decent but if you wan t a better room you are looking at well over your budget.Hotel2Stay is out at Sloterdijk station so you will need a train/bus/tram to get into town. Not a dealbreaker.Your budget is pretty small tbh so you will likely need to stay outside the centre. If you can up your budget ever so slightly to about £120 per night then The Ramada is a good deal https:/…https://www.conscioushotels.com/ Vondeplpark one has a double for about £115 pn - that is about the best deal I see.BTW my sister is taking the train from Stirling to Amsterdam in August but it does take about 9 hours.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Yeh I know about the Lloyd hotel rooms, the bookings I looked at definitely had an ensuite (I wouldn't book without one) and I'm not that bothered about the open ones (our honeymoon suite had virtually no privacy lol) However I think I've changed my mind from what everyone is saying, and will look at places closer to the centre now. Will up the budget since I'll be saving on transport costs. I live 15 mins outside of Stirling, there's no way I would take multiple trains taking 9 hours when I could drive half hour to Edinburgh and be on a plane! She must love the travel!"
"Yeah she is doing it for the trip. She loves trains. It is not that bad tbh. Stirling to Edinburgh then direct to Kings cross and then Eurostar direct to Amterdam. She has flown many times as have I, so just doing something different. She is flying back though.LOL I know where Alloa is. I'm from Stirling and my mum lives in Cambus Park in Tullibody ;-)The Conscious hotel I mentioned is pretty decent and only about a 10 minute tram ride from the Leidseplein/Museums but if you want to up your budget and I can help you get something closer then let me know.Edited: 2 years ago "
"HiI would look into bnbs, we've stayed in some lovely ones and tend to work out cheaper than hotels"
"Make sure you read our top question to the right of the Amsterdam forum on apt renting, Airbnb, etcThere is an epidemic of people,losing money thru very slick very well done scamsIf in doubt at all——ask here first is my advice"
"I don't do Airbnb, I just don't trust it, even though I know loads of people who have used it lol Maybe I'm slightly old fashioned for a 28 year old! Thanks for everyone's help, we ended up booking Hotel Vondel, upped the budget as recommended. Thank you!Edited: 2 years ago "
