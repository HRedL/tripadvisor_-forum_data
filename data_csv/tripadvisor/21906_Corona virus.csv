"Yes, quite correct,Greekadmirer. More to the point, why is TA allowing max to continue to post inaccurate and misleading information on these forums, in spite of this being flagged up several times already."
None of us know but it is disappointing it continues in my opinion.
Thank you Tripadvisor...
Might get taken down but the comment from Max was the virus did not exist in Greece..
"There will be plenty of people out there who are either planning to, or have already booked their travel arrangements for Greece this year. Some will be more relaxed about the situation, adopting a wait and see approach. Others will be more anxious and wondering if they should consider changing their plans or cancel existing bookings. So any 'advice' offered on these forums should be as accurate as possible, given the uncertainty of the developing situation. To make a statement like that was simply irresponsible."
"I'm betting cruise ship dockings on Santorini will be WAY down this year. If you can get there, it might be a good year to go."
Yiassas - Greece seems to be much more proactive than the British government. One of the 10 steps we are to take here if we feel ill is NOT to visit doctor or call 111. i I think there will be rise in 999 calls and visits to A & E. Think Greece might be safer than here - it is just getting there that is putting me off.
#12 Pretty shrewd! This idea I liked! Bravo!
"My vacation is booked April 26-May 5. So far haven't cancelled, travelling from Canada. Little nervous about going but so far Greece is on the low numbers for the virus *knock on wood*My one concern is our flight goes from Canada-Paris CDG-Munich-Santorini - which Munich and Paris are pretty big hotspots for the virus right now."
"I have flights booked for a holiday in Greece (island hopping) at the beginning of June. I work in the events industry and have just cancelled a major trade show in the UK due to coronavirus (so have researched the subject thoroughly). Governments can only guess and predict the spread and timescale of the virus and potentially it could be much worse worldwide by May/June. I have decided to book only things which have free cancellation (ie accommodation and car hire), but will leave the ferries until later as we can’t cancel. We paid for our flights on credit card last December - so should be covered for those if our travel insurance won’t."
Greece shuts all museums and ruins over coronavirus.
“ Greece shuts all museums and ruins over coronavirus.”You left out the part that they will be closed until March 30th. Of course that could change as coronavirus spreads.
"All malls, cafes, bars and food outlets are to close now too though supermarkets are to remain open. Food outlets offering home delivery service will be able to continue.AndTA, please let us get rid of those that spread ""fake news"" and inaccurate and misleading information. (max?)"
"I’ve tried reporting ‘max’ - or whatever he’s calling himself now - but TA really doesn’t want to know,Do DEs have any more influence with TA?"
"If you look at his profile you will see he's posting on TA France and TA Spain as well. No new posts since March 11th, though."
"On March 11th in the French TA max wrote: ""salut, j'irais, le problème du virus est inexistant en egypte.""On the same day it was reported there were 80 confirmed cases in Egypt, and one death."
"I have reported him too and I know several other DE's have aswell. But to no avail. However after I reported him when he was still ""lancelot"", his profile changed to ""max"". On the Italian TA he was DE for Greece before, now he's DE for Crete and Sicily.Unbelievable.Edited: 3:12 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Forget him..People appreciate those who help be it Destination Experts , Regular genuine forum posters and indeed posters who post not so often but with good genuine advice...Pretty clear Max or Lancelot does not fall into that category on the Greece forum we all love and support.And let’s not forget the serious issue of this post that Max had his post deleted by TAEdited: 3:38 pm, March 13, 2020 "
>>And let’s not forget the serious issue of this post that Max had his post deleted by TA<<The post is still there.
Nicksy it was taken down...Clearly he has powers none of us do to have it reinstated and utterly disgraceful of TA to reinstate such comments ..
I am posting this last comment prior to closing my TA account as a result of this disgraceful link...And now closing my TA account as I am told I have no access once I do..This link probably will get taken down I guess..A sad situation..
"I’m afraid TA really doesn’t want to know. It spouts all kinds of policy positions, but actually there’s more chance of this post being taken down (because it criticises TA) than a completely irresponsible one concerning the pandemic."
