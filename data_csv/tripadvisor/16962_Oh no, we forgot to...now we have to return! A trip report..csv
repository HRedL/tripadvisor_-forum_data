"We had an amazing 16 day holiday in France which included a brief four day tour through the Loire Valley. We started and finished our holiday in Paris and although we had 10 nights and 9 full days in Paris there was still so much we missed. I fell asleep last night thinking about all the places to see on my next holiday. Yes, Paris got under my skin. There is so much to love about the city and the people. Yes, we saw some of the various scams and some rather unpleasant individuals but for the most part we had excellent customer service (yes, really), and in some cases (many cases actually) encountered friendliness and goodwill! We found our days were filled with seeing one (or two at most) major sites and spending the rest of the time wandering around. We discovered really good ice cream on Ile Saint-Louis just across the bridge from Notre Dame. We discovered that while we couldn't order lunch at 3pm that we could order drinks so spent many moments enjoying wine and hot chocolate in the afternoons. We walked and walked and walked. My feet were fine but my knees ached constantly from the constant shifting on the uneven pavements. I brought my giant New Balance runners because they provide the most stability but even they didn't help so I ended up just wearing my black walking shoes or my little flats. Nothing could have prepared me for the knee pain. Still, I walked through the pain and managed to climb the Tower of Notre Dame, the Dome of Sacre Coeur and the stairs of the Eiffel Tower (up and down). It wasn't the stairs that was hurting me, it was the constant shifting. In the end, on our last full day, I ended up wearing my beautiful Mephisto sandals which have a bit of a heel and my knees felt no worse. So now when I see all those women walking in those gorgeous shoes I get it: everything hurts anyway so you might as well look good!We enjoyed some lovely meals and found the service unhurried but not too slow either. One evening my daughter and I ordered drinks and dinner and after 40 minutes we still hadn't received anything but we were happy chatting away and people watching. Suddenly the server came running over with our drinks apologizing profusely which surprised me as we hadn't been complaining. Still, it was more fun to relax with a drink. We loved the pace of dining.We enjoyed some great French food but also tried a few of types. We discovered a great little Vietnamese Pho restaurant in the Marais which was perfect on a showery evening. We also enjoyed a few meals at the various Italian restaurants. Most of our meals were take away sandwiches, salads, baguettes and fruit and yogurt from the various shops. We really enjoyed the variety of ready to eat food in the various shops. Many mornings we would pop into a boulangerie and buy a baguette to share in a park or square. We seemed to eat constantly but never that much at a time. What didn't we like? All the cigarette smoke (I am asthmatic) but we decided to just ignore it and I got used to it eventually. The crowds on the metro. Sometimes it was hard to get off at our station because people would start shoving in at the same time. We took the bus one day and found it very pleasant. Mostly we walked.What we loved? Almost everything. We spoke French as well as we could and used our best manners upon entering and leaving shops. We loved the musicians on the various bridges, the impromptu dancing here and there, and the absolute beauty of the architecture of Paris. I was also thrilled with the gardens and parks in Paris. I love the precision of the plantings. And the whimsy of seeing two tethered goats eating grass near the Louvre!We live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, famous for the beauty of its setting in nature, but Paris! Oh, my, I never dreamed that stones and bricks could be so lovely. Yes, I have fallen for Paris and we hope to return one day soon."
"We are returning to Paris for our second visit in September. I agree. It is a city that takes you by your heart and won't let go. We are so anxious to return. Do you remember the name of the ice cream place you enjoyed? What was your favourite tourist attraction?Hope you have a third trip planned for the not too distant future, Journeywizard!Edited: 7 years ago "
Beautiful thoughts of Paris! So true about the uneven sidewalks.....it didn't bother me as much but my husband has a bad hip and knee and it really slowed him down. Like you we didn't rush our trip even though it was our first so now we have our second trip to look forward too!
Wonderful report. Another victim of PPD. I fear it's going to become an epidemic.
"Oooooh, PPD, I've got it bad.Best ice cream: www.berthillon.fr/mag/fr/page-112620.htmFavourite tourist attraction: ummm, Paris. Trying to choose one favourite tourist attraction would be like trying to choose a favourite pair of shoes, or a favourite child, lol, but some of my favourites were:Saint-Chapelle, Musee D'Orsey, L'Organgerie, Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the Seine, all the bridges, and all the streets and squares near the river."
Thanks...both the ice cream spot and remarks about choosing a favourite attraction - duly noted! ;)
"Yep, I feel your pain about your knees. I took 2 different pairs of walking shoes that I switched out daily. My knees still complained, especially doing all the stairs in the metro. (I hate the chatelet station!) It's interesting you mentioned the cigarette smoke. Like you, I'm asthmatic, so the first time I got the drifting smoke I had that weird little cough. After a while, I didn't notice it. Oddly enough, I noticed it more while in NYC for 24 hours.I've just returned to work after spending 2 weeks in France - with 5 1/2 days in Paris. I've spent most of the day telling my co-workers about everything we did (or didn't get a chance to do). I've got PPD *bad* and there's nothing to be done for it but to go back. I'm thinking late March...Edited: 7 years ago "
