"So I currently have a UK Visit Visa and will be flying to the UK in December 2018 for 2 weeks. It's valid til June 17, 2019. I have plans though, to fly back to the UK around last week of June 2019, and my visa will already have expired.Can I apply for a new one while my current visa is still valid? What's the best thing to do in this situation? Thanks!"
"I don't see why you cannot apply for another Visa,but you cannot apply more than 3 months before your intended travel date.https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor-visaSo earliest you can apply is around end of March time"
"Yes, that's my target date to apply as well. In case it gets refused, will I still be able to use my current valid visa before its expiry, or is it automatically cancelled the moment I apply for a new one?"
Your present Visa is valid until the last day on the Visa. I see no reason for anyone to cancel your present Visa.Any new Visa will have seperate dates of validity on themOn your application form it will ask for information about Visas granted to UK and other areas so it will be seen that you have a current valid visa
"I don't know how the visas work in the UK, but are they, just like Schengen visas, single or multiple entries?"
I got a 6-month multiple visit visa. So I can visit as much as I want until it expires.
That is correct.
"I wouldn’t expect you to have a problem but, just to clarify.The policy with respect to “overlapping visas” is not specifically spelled out in the rules. The immigration policy for the UK (and I believe Schengen is the same) is that overlapping time periods for visas are not allowed, and that only one type of permission can be valid at any one time. That latter condition would apply if, for example, you had an unexpired visitor visa and then tried to apply for a student visa while it was still current (it would be cancelled if the student visa were to be granted).If you apply for new visa of the same type before the existing one has expired (there’s no reason why you can’t do this), then the validity dates cannot overlap. You cannot have two visitor visas which are both current. What would happen is that the issuing centre should curtail the expiry date of the first visa so that it ends before the second visa starts. That would be recorded in the database and an endorsement made to the face of your existing visa to change its end date. That would only happen if/when the second visa was granted, not automatically just because you made a new application. Otherwise, the existing visa continues to be valid until it naturally expires (even if the second visa was refused).In your case it should be straightforward as long as your personal circumstances haven’t materially changed and your travel pattern doesn’t show you’re trying to stay in the UK for more than 6 months (eg by a short exit and then re-entry) . The second application would not in itself compromise the validity of you existing visa unless a refusal arose from something serious such as criminal activity.Note that there is no process for extending a Visitor Visa beyond 6 months, so you are following the correct process. However, if you expect to visit the UK on multiple occasions over a longer period you could apply for a long-term Standard Visitor Visa (lasting two, five or ten years). It may prove more convenient, and perhaps slightly better value. A two year visitor visa would cost £350 for example (versus the usual £93 for 6 months). You could then come and go as you please during that period, but not stay longer than six months per year/visit"
R-in-SurreyThanks for that detailed info.Have been helping my family and friends for some time acquire visas now but have learned more from your postings.
"Hi, did you manage to apply for and receive your visa while the your 1st visa was valid?Planning to get my parents to visit later this year again. Thanks!"
"Hi! Yes, it was no problem. :)"
"Hi! Can you explain how it ended up working in he end? Did they curtail your life costing visa while issuing a new one? My current visa will end on November 25th, but I was planning to visit the UK November 5th to December 1st. I was wondering if the new visa would start after the current one (maybe a day later?) and would require me to leave the country before my old visa expires and reenter using the new one. God this is confusing"
Can I apply for renewal of my visa that has not expired
Post #12... it helps if you read the information already supplied.See the second para of post #7 and confirmation in post #10
Hi! What dates were stated in your visa? Does the date start when your previous valid visa ended? Thanks for the reply. It would really help me a lot.
"My visa is expiring on 20 November 2019,and l intend to visit UK in December 2019,can l apply for a new visa right now ei one month before expiry of previous visa"
Post #15Yes you can.
"Hi, I already have six month visitor visa, that expires by Jan 2020. I would like to apply for long term visitor visa now. I have been to UK nd returned lately. And I have been to UK 8 times before. So will I be able to apply now before the existing expires? Will it get refused or if it refuses will my existing visa gets effected??"
"RinPlease look through the previous posts and your question is answered.No one can tell you if it will be refused/accepted,that is down to UK Government"
">>>So will I be able to apply now before the existing expires?<<<Yes>>>Will it get refused?<<<It will be considered based on the information you supply and the justification for needing it. You say that you have visited on eight previous occasions, so you seem to have no difficulty meeting the general conditions. As long as you have respected your immigration permissions each time then it should also be seen that you do have a valid need. Providing the pattern of those visits does not raise a suspicion that you are spending so much time in the UK that you are making the UK your surrogate home then your application should be straightforward, but none of us can say whether you will be successful.>>>or if it refuses will my existing visa gets effected??>>>No, it shouldn't, providing a refusal doesn't arise from something serious such as a criminal record or a very dramatic change in your circumstances. Otherwise, your existing visa would naturally expire according to the original date... not cancelled just because you were not granted a long-term visitor visa.I trust that you know that (if granted) a long-term visitor visa will not allow you to stay for more than six months per visit. It's only long-term in the sense that the validity period means you don't have to make a new application each time you visit."
"hey can i please ask something? i am allowed to vist the Uk without a visa and stay for 6 months, so my question is, when this 6 months expires but i wanna stay longer in the UK what am i supposed to do? if you have any infomation considering this please enlighten me. TİA"
"Hi @ Bubbly GYou can't stay longer than 6 months as a visitor. That's the maximum per visit, it's inflexible and cannot be extended.You would have to leave the UK and then re-enter, seeking another 6 month period. Your leave to remain would be re-assessed when you arrived the second time. There is no specific time period you have to wait before seeking re-entry and no specific rule about how long you could spend in the UK during the year, but it's at the discretion of Immigration.They will just want to be satisfied that you aren't attempting to make the UK your surrogate home by making frequent/repeat visits... so you might expect to be questioned and it would be wise for you to have a good reason for leaving and re-entering after a very short period (and 'I wanna stay longer' is not in itself a valid reason). Re-entry is not guaranteed, but many people have no problem doing this... particularly when justified by some specific event or reason.The only other way you can be in the UK continuously for a period longer than 6 months is with a specific visa that justifies it (eg a student visa for a recognised course or a work visa for specific employment). There is no standard visitor visa that gives you more than the 6 month maximum.Edited: 4:14 am, November 13, 2019 "
"Thank you so much for such a detailed information, i really appreciate it."
"Hi R-in-Surrey,I am on a tier 5 currently and have already applied for a new tier 2 visa. The Tier 5 does not expire until January and they have granted me to activate the new tier 2 at the end of December. Can I still enter the UK on the tier 5 since it has not expired yet and then leave the country and re-enter during this activation period for the tier 2?Any clarification would be appreciated.Thank you!"
"Hi V.P.My understanding would be 'yes'.Your Tier 2 visa should have been granted as an 'Entry Permission' for future use (ie from the end of December). It isn't valid for entry purposes until that time and your existing Tier 5 visa continues to be valid for entry until the Tier 2 visa takes over.You can't have two visa types or entry permissions valid at any one time, so on the day when your Tier 2 visa is activated by entering the UK, your Tier 5 visa and any permissions associated with it will be cancelled (or will naturally expire at the end of January if you are out of the country at the time and haven't yet used your Tier 2 visa).Edited: 9:07 pm, December 01, 2019 "
"Hi R-in-Surrey,Thank you so much for the information! Just one more thing on this, I can leave to any other country and return during this entry permission period in order to activate this visa or will I need to return to my home country?Many thanks"
"Hi V.P.No, you don't have to go back to your home country. You only need to leave the UK and then return from a non-UK country. Ideally, you should also leave the UK 'Common Travel Area' (including Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands), otherwise there is a complication that you would need to seek out an Immigration Officer to ensure that you get an entry stamp to start the clock on your new visa."
"Hi Karla, I’m in the exact same position as you were. I hold a South African passport and currently have a valid 6 month tourist visa that expires on Feb 7 2020. I am currently in Tanzania and want to travel to the uk in March. Just wanting to find out if you applied for a new tourist visa while you still had the old one ? What was the result if you did ? Your input would be greatly appreciated!"
