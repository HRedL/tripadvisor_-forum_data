"Based on what my family there is telling me, the leaders of Mexico are not taking this serious.https:/…"
"Yes!! Everyone should/must take this Very seriously!! I work at VA hospital...we started taking it very seriously months ago as soon as it surfaced ...and really applying mandatory precautions, practices and locking Down our nursing home wing from outside visitors (except for hospice patients) a month ago already! Crazy how people are stilllllll considering flying and congregation areas ...please, stop being selfish..it continues to spread the virus...social distancing!! Wash your hands!! Wash them again and again!! The quicker people isolate and quarantine... the better chance ALL we have!"
"yup....this is from two days ago, on the delayed approach Mexico is taking, or more specifically what Obregon is saying and doing:https:/…Mexico, by contrast, has so far taken a “business as usual” attitude. People still crowd street markets picking through piles of fruit and vegetables. Cars and trucks continue to fill the streets and commuters throng subway trains, though the volume of traffic is noticeably lower.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his government have said a shutdown of the country would disproportionately hurt poor people and also be a psychological weight on all Mexicans. They say there is no reason to impose major restrictions before health officials deem them necessary – a moment they are expecting in late March, based on the virus’ pattern elsewhere and the Feb. 27 date of Mexico’s first confirmed case.The approach is worrying many experts.But it is the president’s personal attitude that has Mexicans puzzled. He continues to attend mass public rallies, shaking hands and kissing babies. Asked how he was protecting Mexico, López Obrador removed two religious amulets from his wallet and proudly showed them off.“The protective shield is the ‘Get thee behind me, Satan,’” López Obrador said, reading off the inscription on the amulet, “Stop, enemy, for the Heart of Jesus is with me.”López Obrador, often described as a leftist, is in fact a nationalist with deep religious feelings.:( Ai yi yi....."
"Ris, I agree. I'm deeply concerned with the ""pull the blankets over your head to hide from the monsters under the bed "" approach. While the Mexican government seems to be taking all the right actions, they are being undermined by the actions of AMLO...and a handful of state governors etc.Worrying indeed."
"Spoke to two of my dearest Mexican friends in Zihuatanejo last night. One manages a great hotel, the other a fishing captain.Places like Thompson and La casa que canta are Closed. Each of these friends had family working at these hotels. As one of hem put it "" I have never seen Zihua or Ixtapa look so lonely""Few people using public transportation..........water taxi's shut down as well as tourist fishing captains are shut down too. Commercial fisherman aren't selling much and the price of fresh caught fish is dropping like a lead balloon.Neither of them believe Semana Santa tourists will be showing up in large numbers this year. These two friends are educated people and are truly concerned for Mexico. Neither of them think their President is handling what soon will be epidemic in Mexico very well.Mexico's health care infrastructure is not equipped to handle a pandemic. I hope and pray that Mexico will do well during this crisis,"
