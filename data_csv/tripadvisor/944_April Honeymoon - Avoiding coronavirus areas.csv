"Hello peeps,I am planning on going for my honeymoon around April time. I will be travelling from India but I want to avoid areas where coronavirus has spread and where it will likely spread. I was thinking somewhere like Turkey, Egypt, Morocco? But I am not sure if these are honeymoon destinations."
"To address your second question, I should think any of Turkey, Egypt or Morocco would make a fine honeymoon destination. All have beach resorts. Turkey and Morocco also have mountains, all have fabulous historical monuments, interesting cities, culture, architecture and fine cuisine. By April, coronavirus might be worldwide or stamped out. I would guess it will not be stamped out."
"I would have thought the virus would be over by April.If you are travelling from India, then look at places like Bali, Singapore or Malaysia.If you live in the UK, then Morocco or Turkey would be convenient from the UK."
"@EdenYes its difficult to predict where it will spread. Officially there has been 0 known cases of Coronavirus but ive read an article from TheGuardian and others saying that the detection in Indonesia is not working. @CultureVultureIm thinking of Turkey. I have been Antalya before and I really liked it. However, it was difficult to find people who spoke english in quiet a few of the shops. What area would you recommend in Turkey?@PrestonGuildI live in UK but im getting married in India so will be travelling straight from India. I really hope the virus is bought under control because ideally I want to go Bali. It looks amazing."
"I was thinking of Antalya but if you have already been then perhaps one of the islands, like Rhodes, although it will be spring weather, not beach weather in April."
Have a look at olu deniz in turkey.it is a beautiful for a honeymoon. Went there myself :)
"As of today, there are 98 reported cases of the virus in Turkey.More to the point, airlines are cancelling flights, hotels and restaurants are shutting down. Strict ""shelter in place"" orders are being imposed by governments, often on short notice. If one were to become ill, would it be wise to be in a foreign country where you don't speak the language and the healthcare system might be completely overwhelmed?This is no time to be traveling anywhere. Since the OP was in early February, one hopes the decision, whatever it is, has been made."
