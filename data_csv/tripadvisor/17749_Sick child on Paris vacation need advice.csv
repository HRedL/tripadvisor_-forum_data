We are in Paris until Friday morning. It is New Year's Day and my 11 year old has fever and sore throat. I would like her to have a step test. Not sure where to go and how insurance works (Blue Cross). Any advice appreciated
Take your child to the nearest hosptal emergency unit.
"Go to the nearest pharmacie for assistance.Or, just phone SOS Medecins - 01.47.07.77.77 for a house call. They will come to you, for very reasonable rates. If not urgent, wait until after 7 or 8 AM, when rate is lower. And/or, if you can wait a day, you may avoid an extra charge for a holiday visit.You will be transferred to an English speaking operator and asked if you would prefer a doctor who speaks English.I had occasion to do this last trip and they were amazing.You will be provided with amount of charge, payable in cash. (So, you can visit the nearest ATM if necessary.)Do you have travel insurance? Do you know if Blue Cross covers you abroad?Regardless, just be SURE to request an itemized invoice, including the diagnosis to document your claim, as it will be nearly impossible to acquire once you've returned home.And, even if you aren't ""covered"", the charge will be incredibly reasonable.If you're not sure if you have coverage, it's really not an emergency (and many Blue Cross plans cover only true emergencies), so SOS may be the far more economical option, rather than going to a hospital emergency room.Whatever you do, don't bother with the American Hospital. Too distant, and more expensive."
"You will not be given a strep test. Period. French doctors simply do not run a panel when people come to their office -- mostly because doctors are not allowed to keep the tests in their offices. He might send you to a laboratory for strep, but probably not.This is not, by the way, a bashing of the French medical system -- just stating that it's different so you don't waste your time arguing for something that's not going to appear."
"I agree with Nurioopta. When you took out your travel medical insurance, there's a phone number to call if you've got an emergencyEdited: 7 years ago "
"Sunshine, do you know if drs in France treat strep with antibiotics (assuming they think it is strep)? I know antibiotic use is lower in Europe than in the US, but I don't know how they handle strep there. I know in the early 90s I saw a dr in the UK for a strep throat and he decided clinically that it was not strep (so didn't treat) but I didn't know what they did if they thought it was strep. The main reason they treat it here with antibiotics is not really for the strep but to prevent rheumatic fever.Unless they never treat strep there, I'd go with the SOS Medecins plan so a doctor can decide what to do."
Right now we are treating with Advil and will see if she can do some sightseeing with that. I did not take out the travel medical but will phone the SOS if I need it. Thank you for the great information.
"We have yet to have a diagnosis of strep since we've been here (and plenty of opportunity for such!)They will give oral antibiotics, never an injection, if they are convinced that it's not viral...if they think it's viral, you're not getting antibiotics!I also have yet to hear about rheumatic fever (or scarlet fever, which is what you get when strep runs unfettered)....even as the parent of school-age children.I've no complaints about any of the treatment we've received, by the way..."
"I called my pediatrician once from Canada, because I was concerned my son had strep. He told me testing for strep is really rather pointless and that a healthy child or adult will get over it in a couple of days with or without antibiotics. Now if it's an immune compromised individual, absolutely they need antibiotics. My pediatrician said use advil, a salt water gargle and lots of fluids and watch for any worsening of his condition. My kid had a very mild fever (99.5) and didn't feel terrible, if I remember correctly."
"In the meantime, go to the pharmacy. They are very helpful and have a lot of French homeneopathic medications that are very effective. I particularly like the Boiron ones which are available even in North America and I always travel with a few of them. Your nearest pharmacist will be a big help. They have a idler latitude when it comes to dispensing advice."
"No, they don't have an idler latitude -- French pharmacists receive more medical training than their North American counterparts, and are fully qualified and authorised to diagnose minor ailments, and to dispense some treatments.Differences in pharmaceutical laws mean that many medicines that are prescription-only in the US or Canada are also over-the-counter in France (and vice-versa).Pharmacists are a trusted sector of the medical industry in France."
"Didn't mean idler but wider, fault of an iPad while prone in bed, but was trying to say exactly the same thing you were, Sunshine. That they can give more advice on minor ailments and recommend things like cough and cold remedies, and my favourite sleeping pills!"
Okay....just wanted to clarify.
And everybody should know that pharmacists will bandage any minor injury free of charge.
"The amount of really great remedies that we bring back after every trip to France, thank's to those pharmacists are simply amazing. It takes years before such things like Voltarene make it this way."
Voltaren is available in the US -- but it's prescription-only there. (I know you're in Canada)
"My kids had chronic strep and because my Mom had had rheumantic fever as a kid, (and died at forty as a direct result) I take it very seriously. My kids' Paris pediatrician would give them strep tests from her office. SOS medecin would simply prescribe antibiotics once I'd shown their health records."
"My dd has had strep numerous times. She used to get treated for it with antibiotics,, now the new doctor says don't bother.. She seems to get well with the"" don't bother treatment"" just as fast as the antibiotics.. with less negative side effects too. Frankly i wonder if people jump to conclusions a bit with strep, sore throats DO hurt, and fevers are body fighting off an infection, so just having a sore throat and fever doesn't mean strep, she could just ""have a bug"".. I think waiting a day or two, taking it easy on those days, and giving her a fever reducer , and then a wait and see, is a good idea. If she still feels terrible or worse in a day or two, take her in.. good luck.. let us know what happens."
"Phread, you're right that Rheumatic Fever is a very rare, but very serious complication from strep. So if a family is going the route of not taking antibiotics - which my doctor does - it's important to watch vigilantly for any worsening of condition or fever and be prepared to bring your child in if they seem to be getting sicker. My doctor says he trusts me to be vigilant, but that there are families he prescribes antibiotics to just in case."
"I think the message is (as with any medical condition) that each case should be dealt with on an individual basis, there is no one size fits all. While in most cases strep is not a huge deal, although it is very painful, in phreads case there is a family history and should absolutely be treated differently."
"Note re: how insurance (Blue Cross) works.I phoned Blue Cross (when new coverage went into effect) and requested details on coverage when traveling outside the USA. I received a detailed letter with a phone number to acquire information about doctors and hospitals near wherever you are. That staff can make arrangements with certain hospitals with direct billing arrangements, otherwise you may be required to pay out of pocket and submit a claim form (enclosed) to be reimbursed.Our plan covers emergencies (defined as immediate care necessary to prevent death or permanent injury to your health) in-network benefits, and out-of-network benefits for care that is not an emergency, but is medically necessary (e.g. sore throat). (Not my example, theirs in the letter.) To file a claim, itemized bills are required that include description of service and other details.You can even choose to have Blue Cross pay the provider in the currency on the bill.The doctor from SOS Medecins provided me a detailed invoice (asked if I needed one). But, others have reported getting home and not having sufficient documentation to successfully process a claim and not being able to acquire it once home.The instructions for our Blue Cross plan are to request an international line to the US and dial 800-810-2583, but your plan could be different.If you do have travel insurance, it's important to know whether the health coverage is primary or secondary and what that means.I always purchase primary, because of the out-of-network co-insurance. So, my illness was covered by the travel insurance since total charges were less than my deductible/co-pay, etc.As mentioned, if you don't have coverage in place, the charges will be surprisingly reasonable.But, it's best not to go to the emergency room for an illness that is not an emergency."
"It is always, always acceptable to go to an emergency room in France if you need to, although to be fair, it takes a while to retrain your North American mind to do so. Hospitals in larger cities have a split system -- there's one emergency room for true life-or-limb emergencies; there's another ER for non-crucial emergencies like illnesses, broken bones, and other injuries that need proper medical attention (asthmatics having full-blown attacks go to the hospital to receive oxygen treatments, for example). They will route you the proper direction as soon as you arrive. They are beginning to add urgent-care centres, but these are still fairly rare, even in the Paris region.Always ask for a ""feuille du soins"" (pronounced ""feoy du swan"") -- this will net you the brown-and-white detailed billing sheet that you'll need.Edited: 7 years ago "
last time I went to a doctor in Paris the charge was less than the co-pay on my US insurance.
..just a comment in case someone ever has to deal with a very seriusly ill child in Paris. Necker Hospital is the pediatric hospital in Paris for children who have pre-existing complex medical problems or a new very serious illness.
"Another post to say that for minor injuries, pains and aches etc. the pharmacists are where one should go in the first place..at least during the day (there are pharmacies open at night in Paris but they aren't always close to where one stays).  A hotel or even a store employee would know the location of the nearest one..though in Paris they are more numerous than Starbucks in North America. On our last vacation in France my buddy walked right in a glass partition..luckily a pharmacy was next door...he had the beginning of a bruise on the forehead already so the pharmacist checked him carefully etc. My mom was an assistant pharmacist. Besides mixing powders and herbs as per doctors' prescriptions, she could check blood pressure, give first aid, injections etc. The pharmacy she worked for goes back to the 1870s and is still around...When she moved to a village to become co-administrator of a long term care facility she was grandfathered (grandmothered?) as a nurse as no nurse was willing to move to that village in the boonies...she ended up being the unofficial nurse and midwife for all the neighbours, along with being the local telephone operator at all hours (no one else in the hamlet had a phone, not even the local aristocrat...)Those were the good old days...when the local doctor sent you to see the local witch or sorcerer if he couldn't do anything for your strange pains and aches..Now that village has streets with NAMES! like rue de la Gare (rail station), rue de l'Eglise (church)...as if it wasn't bleeding obvious where both of them were, in such a small place.....there is a mini-museum and the village as an internet site!"
"Update: As every parent knows, you never know when your child wakes up in the middle of the night burning up where the week will take you. Especially without a thermometer, which I will remember to pack in the future. Luckily, the fever and throat and stomach symptoms resolved within 2 days and did not slow us down much. Thank you again for the advice and I am looking forward to a future trip sans 3 kids to really see Paris."
"Thank you so much for the update famlip, glad to hear everything turned out ok, and that you still managed to enjoy Paris."
Glad to know it all ended up ok.
"Just so everyone knows, a doctor's house call to your hotel room or apartment costs 33 euros (52€ on Sundays and around 70 € at night), so even if your foreign health insurance doesn't cover it, there is no reason to worry about cost when your health is at stake. Regular prescription drugs are also cheap so even if you were to see a doctor, have a couple of tests done and need to buy meds at the pharmacy it would be difficult for the total bill to be more than a 2-digit figure. The cost of medical exams is a tiny fraction of what it would be in the US (for instance an MRI or cat scan costs about 150 € including the doctor's fee)."
"150 euros vs the few thousand dollars here? all of this just makes me whimper at our for profit health care systemin the U.S. ....sorry, someone offended (who thinks we have the ""best"" health care system in the world) can now delete this post...."
"Agree, MomCat. As the Paul Hipp song goes, ""We're Number 37."" France is Number 1."
"< It is New Year's Day and my 11 year old has fever and sore throat ... Luckily, the fever and throat and stomach symptoms resolved within 2 days and did not slow us down much >The Belgian press is reporting today that winter influenza is expected to reach epidemic level in Belgium in the next few days. There is already an influenza epidemic in the Netherlands and France, and Belgium is ""under assault"" from both sides.Symptoms: feverishness, sore throat, cough, aching muscles and joints, lassitude, loss of appetite ... affecting in particular children between the ages of 5 and 14.From your description, it sounds as if your daughter may have been a victim."
"I'm hoping against hope that the fact that it hit ""epidemic"" status over the Christmas holidays means that fewer people will be contagious by the time we all go back to work and school.Even I think I'm wearing my rose-colored glasses, though."
"33 Euros for a housecall - amazing. My copay for a doctor's visit in the doctor's office is $25 (that's after insurance has paid their 80% share) - and I have ""excellent"" insurance by American standards."
"Just to add to what VintageBabe said, Necker is the hospital to bring kids for any reason. I once had to bring a kid there for an infected toe. The other ERs in the city usually have their fair share of crazies, but Necker only treats minors, so it is not only adapted for treating kids, but feels safer."
