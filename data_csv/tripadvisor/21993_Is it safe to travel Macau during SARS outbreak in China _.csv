Is it safe to travel Macau during SARS outbreak in China ?
Since china has the biggest population on earth and they are doing business everywhere The only safe place is antartica
"It's not SARS. It's Coronavirus.As of now, Coronavirus does not have the same high mortality rate as SARS, and it's not certain whether it is transmitted person to person yet.Edited: 1:16 pm, January 22, 2020 "
"Not SARS, but a new and related coronavirus. (SARS is also caused by a coronavirus, just to clarify the above post). So far the Chinese have understandably resisted the name ""Wuhan virus"" but for our purposes until a catchier name is invented, that's what I'm calling it. Macau has just announced its first confirmed case of Wuhan virus. Whether that is enough to dissuade you from going, up to you. Nobody can guarantee your ""safety"" and everything is relative. If your trip is not in the near future, wait to make a decision.Edited: 1:24 pm, January 22, 2020 "
"And to correct #3, it is CONFIRMED that this new ""Wuhan virus"" coronavirus CAN BE TRANSMITTED PERSON TO PERSON. Similar to the SARS coronavirus, though so far doesn't seem to be as virulent.Edited: 1:26 pm, January 22, 2020 "
yes person to person spread...no question.
"But let's put it into perspective. There have been some 200 cases in a city of 10 million (0.00002 %), and that city is 2 hours by air away from Macau."
"#7: Again, the risk of actually catching the illness is relatively small, if you play the odds. But the risk of governmental measures to contain the spread of disease, including quarantine, transport shutdowns, closure of public entertainment places, etc. is relatively high. Measures that can disrupt an traveler's enjoyment of a place, possibly even travel arrangements. Macau is a separate governmental entity from the mainland and like Hong Kong, will assess and address the situation in its own way. I am not familiar with the proclivities of Macau government thinking, so will leave speculation on possible future actions to those on the forum who deal with/in Macau regularly."
"It is understandable to be worried. In Macau there are major tourist attraction areas where tourists pack in very tightly, shoulder-to-shoulder at times, particularly in the Senado Square to Ruins of St. Paul's area, Rua do Cunha (Taipa Village) and Venetian Canal Shoppes to name a few places. The vast majority of tourist in Macau are from the mainland and travel in groups. Ferry terminals, border crossings and public bus transportation are other places where you can plan on spending a lot of time in jam packed areas. If this is concerning to you, bring face-masks with you and use them accordingly."
Iâ€™m due to go there on March 11. Should I cancel my flight? Will airline honor the change free?
for @10...why ask here...call your airline. Things are changing minute to minute ...I think most will offer refunds or changes or help travelers who prefer not to take the risk.
"From the Cultural Affairs Bureau website:""In response to the current outbreak of the new coronavirus, all cultural venues of the Cultural Affairs Bureau will be closed from 25 January, and all public libraries will be closed from 2pm on 24 January. The reopening date of the cultural venues will be announced in due course."" https://www.icm.gov.mo/enSo not sure if this answers OP's original question, but I'd also note that as of today, my Eva Airlines flight scheduled for next week from TPE to MFM is still on, and there are no travel advisories regarding Macau on the Eva website.If this changes(the closure of cultural venues) or is incorrect, please advise as I had planned on visiting Macau this weekend; thanks.Edited: 4:58 pm, January 26, 2020 "
"It is not incorrect, hrtraveler. The Macau authorities have cancelled all Chinese New Year activity, some museums as well as sponsored cultural activities immediately and indefinitely at this time. They are placing serious measures on entry into Macau going forward from residents of Hubei in mainland China or those who have been to the province in the past two weeks, need a doctor's certificate so they can enter Macau. The authorities are also keeping schools shut until 10 Feb (Hong Kong is doing the same until 17 Feb). A lot is happening fast in regard to the the new Wuhan coronavirus, the spread globally is concerning. Until there are genuine signs of containment, I don't believe there will be any changes to the above."
