I can’t believe anyone is actually asking, but they must be since articles have appeared about that subject. If it sounds like fun to be with thousands of strangers in a multi-story building that you can’t leave, with masks and social distancing, a cabin redolent with germicidal spray, no live shows, meal buffets, spa treatments, or dances with mysterious strangers, and wondering if it’s OK to touch this railing or that tabletop, a cruise might be just the thing for you.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-w… -- This optimistic article, written in May, speculated that cruising could start reappearing in June.

"It's a mad, mad, mad world out there.Revenge travel. Hmmmm. Interesting article. I guess that would be along the lines of... ""Take THAT, Coronavirus! I'm getting on a plane despite you!""."
Or maybe Dare travel. There may be an underground pot and bounty somewhere for contestants to claim prizes. Secret Youtube channel. ;)

"Someone out there had to be writing about Covid19 travel. It's not going away anytime soon in the USA, especially California. Someone with the right mindset could grab a few dollars. Before and after history tour."
I thought I’d add this tool to help travelers. It assesses the chance someone will have Covid around you depending the county and number of people. So if you think 30 other people will be at the outdoor restaurant you’re going to put in 30. If 200 people are in the Costco put in 200. Obviously it’s not foolproof as it’s based on averages which can change moment to moment. https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/…
"According to some immunologists, plane travel is pretty safe. Personally I don't trust that the airlines clean their filters as often as they say they do. https:/…flying-in-the-age-of-covid-19"
"I have no idea how often they maintain the air filters. Even in the VERY best of times, sitting in rows of cramped seats, in almost full-body shoulder-to-ankle contact with a stranger on one or BOTH sides, is a nightmare. Bad enough that people are sealed up together in that container with common cold or flu viruses.For the foreseeable future, if I can't get to a place by car, bicycle, foot, or Amtrak with a sleeping cabin or guaranteed safe radius, it isn't a place I need to go."
