"Maybe best to have one topic that serves as the catch-all for closures/cancellations of sites/events. The Museum of Flight is closed as of Wednesday, March 11. (As an aside, this points up my concern about my upcoming trip to New Orleans, where the WWII Museum is a top priority.)~ Colleen"
"I was wondering about your NO trip, Colleen.I want so badly to go to a museum exhibit on Pompeii  in SF for my birthday, but if I fly out of Bellingham, I probably connect in SEA. That could be a problem if the “social distance” thing escalates."
I just saw that the Woodland Park Zoo will be closed through the end of the month.

"If I were you, Marie, I'd book a nonstop from PAE to SFO regardless of current events. Although at present, I wouldn't plan a trip from scratch; just too many unknown variables. Whether SEA is even operating when our trip is scheduled is anyone's guess. :-(~ Colleen"
Boeing Factory Tours are suspended through March 26.~ Colleen
Thanks Delrock. That's been the best link I've seen so far for such info.
"All flights from the European Union to the US are also suspended for 30 days.Edited: 10:15 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"""Tom Douglas will close 12 of his 13 restaurants. The 13th, Dahlia Bakery, will stay open because it has a contract with Hotel Andra, across the street. Tom Douglas, one of Seattle's most well known chefs, will temporarily close all his 12 restaurants effective Sunday, his spokesperson said Wednesday evening.""Edited: 10:52 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"except flights from the UK, which is just odd.That’s a huge move on Tom Douglas’ part. Not surprising, though, as I was just reading about restaurant closures in Vegas."
"The UK is no longer part of the European union. But apparently the ban doesn't apply to US citizens and permanent residents. Trump made a deceiving announcement.Edited: 1:15 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Reportedly, people coming back in will be subject to quarantine. It’s not so easy figuring out what is going on.I know the UK is no longer EU—but the UK has actual cases, right? And you can drive/bus/train from the EU to the UK easily enough. So leaving uk out doesn’t make much sense to me."
"Not that if affects visitors, but so many school districts are closing. Some for 2 weeks, and some for 6 weeks. Our district announced last night a 6 week closure."
"""Our district announced last night a 6 week closure.""Crazy. ~ Colleen"
Well I am all for it.
"""So leaving uk out doesn’t make much sense to me.""Agreed, Marie, but inconsistency & illogic are a common theme as far as this goes.~ Colleen"
"The UK isn't part of the Schengen area, so it makes some sense from that perspective."
This thread is very helpful. It would be helpful if you could include a link to the organization's web site with their 'official' announcement or to a news agency.

"Now all k-12 schools, public and private, in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties are to be closed until April 24th"
"Some more closures include Seattle Art Museum, Seattle Aquarium, Museum of History & Industry, and MoPOP. I'm not going to worry about cutting & pasting links to the announcements, since they're easily accessed.~ ColleenEdited: 7:57 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Tourist related on national scale:WDW, Smithsonians, follow DL in shutting down.Locally: Pacific Science Center. Don’t think they’ve been listed yet. All public libraries, community centers now closedAlso, if you have theater or ballet tickets, doublecheck, because a whole bunch of places are postponing/cancelling."
"Biscuit Bitch locations closed or in process of closing by Sunday.No visits to state prisons (probably does not impact tourists but hey, it’s interesting)UW med postpones elective procedures.Metro transit fares required but no fare checking (although why you’d announce that is a mystery.)https:/…1"
"And finally, space needle closed."
"I think we're officially talking to ourselves. That is to say:a Seattle-specific tourist visit is likely not A Thing just now, unfortunately. I'm not on board with how this is being handled ~ but no one's asking me. So.~ Colleen"
I wish they would make tests available to everyone who shows any symptoms instead of sending them home. Numbers should be updated as well and not kept from the public.
There aren't enough tests Anna L. Don't you read/listen to the news?
"The Makah Tribe is closing a few things on the peninsula including the Shi Shi trail, the Cape Flattery trail and the 3rd beach trail. For the full details check their website www.makah.com"
"You probably know already, Colleen, but the public library is closing starting Monday. They’re open limited hours today and tomorrow.I understand why, but darn:("
"Thanks, Marie, I did see that. Six weeks! We went to the library here (Lynden) earlier today and it was absolutely jam-packed. Oh, the irony...~ Colleen"
"""Gov. Inslee to order Washington restaurants and bars to close""https:/…"
"I wish we could pin this latest announcement. It is very important for people to see, just in case anyone was still contemplating a visit. And even for locals, to check what the latest closures that will effect them are. Thank you."
"Just in case anyone is still thinking of heading over to the peninsula, all visitors centers for ONP are closed and the road to Hurricane Ridge is closed. Also, the Quileute Reservation is closed to tourists/visitors."
"I’m glad the park closed those areas—not because I think it’s bad to be in the park, but because some of the hiking groups I sometimes join keep planning hiking trips with people going in carpools. Unless one drives a bus, passengers aren’t able to stay 6 feet apart and they’re in the car together for 5-6 hours. I wish Seattle would go as far as closing Greenlake—it’s been mobbed the last two afternoons now that nice weather is here."
"I've heard that about Greenlake, and Cal Anderson here on the Hill. Not exactly the idea to crowd into a sunny public park, however tempting that might be this time of year."
"Agreed, PJHistor & suze. These restrictions really need to be an all-or-nothing deal.~ Colleen"
