Sorry to ask about chikungunya but couldn't find any recent posts - maybe that is a good sign? We'll be on St. John in mid-June and have our fingers crossed that the virus is mostly gone. Any related mosquito info/advice would be much appreciated. Thanks TA folks!
"The epidemic is long gone but it doesn't mean that the virus isn't here just as Dengue is. Deet-containing insect repellents have always been and continue to be on the visitor's ""bring list"" next to the sunscreen."
"Thank you, STTResident. That is reassuring. Looking forward to visiting St. John again. :-)"
It's been months since I've heard of any new cases. I think it's safe to say the epidemic has passed.
