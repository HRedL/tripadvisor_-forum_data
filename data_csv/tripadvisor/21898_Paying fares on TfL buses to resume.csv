"From tomorrow, 23rd May, passengers will need to touch in/pay on the buses, but for the time being on only on those buses with single door entry/exit and the new Routemaster routes.Others will be introduced later, so on buses travelling along the same road will depend on which bus you get on to determine if you pay or not.https:/…uk-england-london-52769099"

Useful - tks
This is the right thing to do at this stage - partly because of the revenue implications and partly because it will discourage some people from using them and they have been quite busy recently.
Thanks for the info Elmersend nothing on the news about it so without you I wouldn't have known
"Received an email with the list of bus routes where you have to touch in as listed below. Oddly the X26 isn't mentioned and I am sure they used single door double decker buses on the route at least prior to buses being free to travel on.Single door routes:124, 138, 146, 162, 192, 233, 273, 315, 318, 322, 336, 352, 354, 356, 367, 377, 379, 383, 385, 394, 404, 424, 434, 462, 463, 464, 481, 631, B13, B14, E5, E10, E11, G1, H2, H3, H20, H26, K1, K4, K5, R1, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R10, S3, S4, U9, W4, W5 and W12New Routemaster bus routes where customers should touch in at the middle door:3, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 21, 24, 27, 38, 59, 67, 68, 73, 76, 87, 137, 148, 149, 159, 211, 253, 254, 415, 453, EL1, EL2 and EL3Single-decker routes where customers should touch in using the middle door for boarding:507 and 521"
Is the X26 not a long wheel base single decker?
"Darren, it was up to a few years ago, think it is now Go Ahead who took over the route and added double decker with luggage racks on the lower deck.Hope this link works https:/…"
Shows you how long it is since I took the X26!
"It's a coincidence, but this afternoon I watched a You Tube video where Geoff Marshall and a mate rode the X26 as part of a £1.50 Hopper fare journey from Orpington to Heathrow. It was definitely a double decker that they rod, and it had extra luggage racks on the lower deck :-)"
Many thanks for posting.
"Not sure about TfL buses but as a guide to the number of passengers allowed on buses I hope this is helpful Double deckers 20 passengers Single deckers 11 passengers Once this level is reached the bus driver might drive past bus stops and sign on the bus might read “ BUS FULL”Don’t blame the driverEdited: 3:40 am, May 24, 2020 "

"Some of the aged have survived the cull. We can still travel, unencumbered, outside of peak hours, on our freedom passes.Anthony K"
"Thereare also bus capacity changesTo further ensure the safety of customers and bus drivers, new limits to the number of customers on board at any one time will be introduced:Double-decker buses with multiple doors will have a capacity of 20 people. Drivers will have the discretion to allow up to 25 passengers, if households are travelling together Single-decker buses will have a capacity of between 6 and 10 people. Drivers will have the discretion to allow up to 7 or up to 14 passengers if households are travelling together, depending on the size of the bus.TfL also say to further ensure the safety of everyone, new limits to the number of customers on board at any one time will be introduced. Please continue to make use of all available space, including the upper deck. You may need to wait for the next bus if the bus you are attempting to board has reached its safe capacity. We ask you to be considerate of our staff and follow their instructions. Wherever possible please avoid the busy times, 05.45 – 8.15 and 16.00 – 17.30."
"There is a further update for those of us London residents who are holders of the 60+ Oyster cards and Freedom Passes in an email received today, I quote from it,From Monday 15 June, we are making temporary changes to the 60+ London Oyster card and the Older Person’s Freedom Pass during morning peak hours. These changes are being introduced following TfL’s funding agreement with Government which required temporary restrictions for customers with these concession cards.  Passengers with a 60+ Oyster card, Older Person’s Freedom Pass, or English National Concessionary Scheme pass will not be able to use these cards before 09:00 on weekday mornings. This is to enable social distancing on the public transport network and help control the spread of coronavirus. Your card will continue to be valid at all other times on weekdays and all day on weekends and Bank Holidays. Disabled Freedom Pass holders are not affected by these changes and can continue to use their card at all times.The email isn't clear in some points but presume it is referring to TfL services and any restrictions on National Rail services are still in place until 9.30am on weekdays. Also remember your face coverings from the same day."
"ElmersEnd, Because queries come up on the forum from domestic and overseas visitors, do you have details about the proposed removal of concessions for young persons? TfL say they will be halting free travel for children, what about the 14 day half fare YVD for 11-15s and the under 11s free travel with an adult, what about zip oyster for under 16s and under 18s ? Any details will be useful information for travellers and visitors using TfL services."
"Hi Adam,Sorry,no haven't seen any details on changes to child fares as of yet, but Sadiq Khan said TfL were asking the government to look at it again, this was posted last week.https:/…uk-england-london-52835881"
"Am I right in thinking that on Public Transport, there will be exemption from mask wearing for those with breathing difficulties?Anthony K"
This from the Mayor of London’s website https:/…who-shouldnt-wear-face-coveringI don’t know about rules elsewhere.
"Children, disabled people and people with breathing disabilities should be exempt:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52927089"

"Had an email updating the details about the temporary restrictions when using Freedom Passes and 60+ Oyster cards for London residents. One thing to note is the extending of the morning peak times starting at 04.30am instead of 06.30am (wonder if that is an error) also being able to use the passes from 09.00am instead of 09.30am. No mention of travelling on the National Rail services so presume this information is for TfL services only, remember your face coverings when travelling, it reads'Transport for London (TfL) has set out details of the temporary changes affecting users of the Older Person’s Freedom Pass in London as part of the response to the pandemic. From Monday 15 June older persons Freedom Pass will not be accepted in the morning peak (between 04:30 and 09:00).Please remember the following before planning a journey:• Changes are in accordance with the funding and finance agreement between TfL and Government and will help conserve space on public transport for people who have to use it to return to work• Older Person’s Freedom Pass and 60+ card remain valid after 09:00 on weekdays and at all times at weekends• Disabled Freedom Pass holders are unaffected and will still be able to travel at all times using their pass• All passengers are reminded to only use public transport if absolutely essential and maintain two metres social distancing wherever possibleThe temporary changes, to take effect from Monday 15 June, are being introduced as part of the recent funding and finance agreement with Government.They will mean that all passengers with an Older Person’s Freedom Pass will not be able to use those passes during morning peak hours in order to help support social distancing on the public transport network and help control the Covid-19 virus.Passengers with a Disabled Person’s Freedom Pass are unaffected and will, as usual, still be able to travel at all times using their Pass if they have to use public transport for their journey.From Monday 15 June, changes to the ticketing system will mean Freedom Passes are automatically set not to be valid during the morning peak period (04:30 to 09:00) Monday to Friday. They will continue to be valid at all other times on weekdays and all day on weekends and Bank Holidays.Passengers are being advised, where possible, not to travel immediately after 09:00 to help reduce potential crowding on buses and trains where effective capacity has been hugely reduced as a result of the requirement to observe two-metres social distancing wherever possible.For more information and to see an updated Freedom Pass map, you can go to the Freedom Pass website, which will be updated when this temporary measure is due to end:'https:/…freedom-passThere is a page on the TfL website that gives information about walking between statons athttps://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/?cid=email_FINAL_TFL347_Walking_and_Cycling_Update-List+of+walking+steps+between+stations"
"Probably one of the last updates on bus travel, received an email saying,'All London buses are now taking payments after enhanced safety measures were installed across the fleet to protect drivers and customers from coronavirus.  Customers are now required to touch in with Oyster, contactless or concessionary cards on all buses, entering through the front doors on most buses as we return to traditional front-door boarding.  Temporary bus capacity limits have now been increased in line with the Government's latest social distancing guidance. Double-decker buses now carry up to 30 passengers, while single-deckers can carry either 11 or 14 passengers depending on their size. Signs on buses clearly mark these new passenger limits, and bus drivers can allow more passengers on board if they are travelling in household groups.  A huge range of cleaning and hygiene measures have been introduced across the transport network to make it cleaner than ever before. This includes all regular 'touch point' areas such as poles and doors, being wiped down with strong disinfectant every day, and the use of additional hospital grade cleaning substances.  When using public transport we ask that you follow these simple tips to help keep everyone safe: Travel at quieter times, and avoid travelling during the peak times of 05:45-08:15 and 16:00-17:30 Wear a face covering. It is mandatory to wear one that covers your nose and mouth for the duration of your journey, including stations, unless you are exempt. The police and TfL’s enforcement officers if necessary will refuse entry, ask people to leave, issue fines or prosecute if you do not comply Wash or sanitise your hands at the beginning and at the end of your journey and carry hand sanitiser with you, if you can. We have sanitiser points available across the network Follow the social distancing signage and guidance in place, keeping your distance from other customers when you travel wherever possible Stay alert to the latest Government advice on how to stay safe as restrictions on travel are gradually eased On buses, please sit next to the window and open windows to improve ventilation.'Hope this is helpful, roll on the Twirlys :-)Edited: 3:38 am, July 14, 2020 "
A couple of months ago Adam-Chance asked if there was any news on the child fares.Today the BBC news webpage has some news that it will change at the end of October. But we will have to wait for the detail to be announced as it only mentions free travel for those aged 11-17 however that isn't across the board. See https:/…uk-england-london-53694922
