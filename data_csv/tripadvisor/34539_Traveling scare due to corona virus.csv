I have travel plans for phuket/krabi/phi in March..just wanted to understand if it's safe to travel?
"no....with 22,500 per day dying in india, it's doubtful you'll make it to or out of the airport at mumbai alive.enjoy what little time you have left with your loved ones now.......while you can"
"So you will take the advice off strangers on a Travel Forum on this ? What does your Government say ??My advice is that you should definitely stay at home.Edited: 9:29 am, February 05, 2020 "
I was in Krabi 3 days back and currently in phi phi. Situations is normal and didn't see any impact till now. I would suggest to wait 2 weeks and then take call according to the situation that time. Predicting and anticipating things now does not make sense since your travel dates are in March.
We are random unqualified strangers offering travel tips on the internet. Why would you listen to advice about whether it’s safe to travel from us? None of us have the first clue about the dangers that this pandemic poses and whether it’s safe for you to travel. Would you really base your travel decisions as a result of a random stranger on the internet saying your trip is safe or unsafe? Consult official travel advisories issued by home country and the Thai Ministry of Health and speak with a doctor if you’re concerned. Good luck.
"So if we follow the advice given here, all questions are useless since the answer is given by a stranger on the internet. So all forums are useless!"
"Basically useless, unless you follow the person's replies, and have agreed with them in the past on same thoughts of other issues.Expats, as myself, and at least 4 others, here permanently or more than a few months of the year, may or may not be a good, better source of info.And post count of the person replying, means nothing, along with that DE thingy as I've read some piss poor advice from them.I usually don't answer specific queries, of places I haven't been to in over 5 or 10 years, and that actually a lot. Many places I've only passed through lately, so wouldn't be comprehensive info.Then there are the 'vested interest' replies, which will tell you it's all unicorns & rainbows. This is way to obvious on the Ko Samui and Chiang Mai forums, where the fact are bent, to flat out lies.Then other replies, I've read, they obviously haven't a clue what they are talking about and simply repeating something they heard or read. Or generalize a whole issue, with possible limited experience. Recent 'floating market' thread was an example, stating none in Bangkok, when there are plenty, though authenticity along with morphing to canal market is debatable.You have the trolls, at least 3, or, maybe 1 working overtime. And I wonder if they have a vested interest in Bali or Nam, and nothing is good here. Favorite false topic of the past ... no street food, and now, the virus.When I state something, and i suspect someone, who may or may not have a vested interest is going to debate it, I'll usually find a source, site, news-blip and post it along with the info.OP of the query can decide for themselves. Most queries can be answered by Google / searching, or simply researching.There is no stupid question, but plenty of lazy questions that could have been answered quicker and better with a net search.Safety is you own responsibility. Due diligence on your part is needed.An example of that is a Jellyfish (box) query recently, and the 'vested interest' crowd chimed in and said 'no worries' and 2 stings in the last 8 or 10 year. When the Gov't itself admitted (rare) that they've had 8 in the last year. That type of mis-information will get people killed.Be Safe, Better Research = Safer / better holiday experience.ENJOY"
I don’t think anyone has a clue apart the people in China who know the real situation. Asking what the situation will be like in a month is pretty useless. I would see how things developed then act accordingly.
"And on topic, the virus........you have a better chance of getting hit and or dying by lightning, than catching the virus at this point.At least the virus, if concerned, can take precautions. Lightning can be a bit unpredictable.What's more concerning than the virus, is the last one to get it here, was a taxi driver, and already had TB................now that's scary. Though he may pay for that little poor judgement, as if TB isn't enough of a health issue at his age. The virus added on may make him #1 to crap out here.The much bigger issue than how he got the virus, is why or how, was he driving a taxi.Edited: 8:19 pm, February 05, 2020 "

"""with 22,500 per day dying in india""OMG I was thinking of switching future holidays to India to be safe. I had better start a ""Is it safe to travel to India"" on the Indian TA site. That is 8,215,500 a year!!!!"

The first few replies to this post are terrible. This is a forum open for discussion and if this is the topic the poster wants to discuss so be it. It’s a public forum. Why ridicule?? If you don’t want to respond and give an opinion then don’t. How many posts I read that start by saying ‘sorry to ask’. People are actually sorry to come on trip advisor to ask questions.

"Hi Rachna, We are planning travelling to Phuket from Mumba on 14th feb.Can you help with some pointers? We are really Indecisive. Looking for some pointers for situation at airport and all. Please suggest."
Most of the deaths are in China...I’d say the biggest problem is airports and confined spaces..Once you get there you should be fine if you take sensible precautions.We live in Chiang Mai which (used to) host a lot of Chinese tourists..We avoid congested places and wear masks when out in public spaces.Wash hands frequently. Open spaces and beaches ..it’s pretty hard to see how you could be infected..
"Finally POST 1 has been removedThanks to whoever was responsible, hopefully POST 37 helpedHappy Travels"
"Good post Not Me. My family is going to Phuket for couple of weeks in March . We will take all the precautions etc..What I want to know (and I realize it may change) , is if anything has changed in terms of Tours (cancelled) , night markets or shopping centres . Fantasea (god forbid! ) Splash Water Park shut down . Anything that will impact my kids experiencing Phuket. We will be in Mai Khao and Patong . General mood of the place... I assume very little given the tourist Baht down given Chinese not visiting - so probably more enjoyable in rat race of Patong."
"Hi Bella. Everything is business as usual. I don't know of anything that has closed due to the virus. Just less people about, and very few Chinese.Have fun,Mark.Phuket Sail Tours."
"# 41 ... CptMark summed it up pretty good, since there (I'm obviously not) and always found to be a good source of current info. Wouldn't expect much to change within the next month.If anything, less tourist, and for us, that would be a good thing, that rat-race thingy. Though not so good for the vendors catering to. Still high season though, so wouldn't think anything closing shop early, as a bit counter productive."
"Thx cpnmark, I too am planning to be there early March, and wanted to be sure tours to ko phi phi, similian islands etc were all still operating."
"I'm in Phuket now, after starting in Bangkok then going to Khao Lak. Everything is still going on, afaik, although it's my first time on the island. I had to go to tbe hospital for a blood condition medication and they've set up a separate entrance for Chinese people. Lots of people are wearing masks in public, maybe 10-20%, but other than that and a lack of bus loads of Chinese tourists, it's all good. I actually live in China, left on the 16th and can't go back yet. Not sure what to do."
If you think coronavirus isnt in phuket then your an idiot. Follow governments advice avoid all thailand.
"Is it safe for 25 feb for phuket travell ?Edited: 10:45 pm, February 11, 2020 "
There is no Coronovirus detected in INDIA barring in Karela x 3 who tested negative for the Virus. The outbreak has killed 1000 ppl in CHINA with 42K people affected in CHINA. Please don't circulate wrong information. You seem to have lost your mind.

"is anyone currently in Phuket Thailand, is business as usual there or is there a health scare?"
"As above, Wonderlust. Business as usual. Just less people about.Mark."
A little off topic but I'm in Ranong / Koh Payam at the moment and it could not be any more 'business as usual'..........
"I was unconcerned until we got an email at work yesterday saying we need to tell our manager if we are travelling to Thailand, I work for the NHS. I’m due to go in 7 weeks, now I’m being realistic and having a plan b holiday in mind. I’ll only not go if the government tells me I can’t. Or I catch Coronavirus here in the UK...."
Surely the NHS is not that incompetent? There is zero factual basis to advise against travel to Thailand.
"@melchett we are going in 7 weeks aswell and will only cancel if we are told we can’t go travel there.  Why did they need you to tell them for, if you don’t mind me asking, just I heard that Thailand is on quarantine on return to uk, but not sure how true that is. As so many rumours flying around is making everything worse. That is my main concern to be honest.Edited: 4:08 am, February 13, 2020 "

@7Craig7x I’m not sure what you are implying with your comment about the NHS (which employs 1.5 million people in the UK) being incompetent but it is slightly goading. Can I remind you that TripAdvisor is not a battleground. For your information: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/n… As a senior chemotherapy nurse I’m guessing they want to reduce the risk of me coming home with a tan and killing half of my patients..
"This is my response for you about TB in Thailand. In fact, the real question is ""How aware is the general public in Thailand about diseases and ways of mitigate them"", which I am afraid will cast a shadow on the answer if it is wise to go there. This is simply because people who are not aware will not seek medical care until is too late and by that time you have a blown in infection cases in large numbers.And now the TB:""Thailand is one of the 30 countries identified by WHO as having the highest tuberculosis (TB) burden. The estimated incidence in 2015 was 172 per 100,000 and estimated mortality, including those dying of TB as a result of HIV infection, was 20 per 100,000"""
"#53How about if you bring the covid19 back to your home country and someone will start dying because u think you can trick a virus? People are funny, you are challenging your NHS but swallowing the Thai govt explanations about so few cases......who in fact don't care about you and it seems they wont care about those who will perish in case the infection will become wide in their country."
Sam I Am - which government agency is advising against travel to Thailand on the basis of coronavirus transmission risk?
If you can’t be helpful to someone regarding their query or things that’s causing them tension .. thn the least you can do is leave them alone and not be nasty by going after their race ..Good day to you and get well soon .:-)
"They have had 33 cases, 12 of with have been sent home already, the rest are recovering in hospital. Thailand is a big country and has a population of 70 million people, so I'm not particularly worried at this stage. I' be more concerned if I was in Bangkok. I'm going in May unless there is a total travel ban to Thailand.Edited: 7:48 am, February 15, 2020 "
Of course it's not safe right now coronavirus is spreading in thailand and they dont have the resources availible like china to even contemplate tracking it successfully also I doubt your travel insurance would cover you for a trip to a country which is known to have the virus active I would check this with your insurer in any case before you go also as there are still chinese visiting places like phuket by land across the border I would seriously reconsider.
https:/…thailand uk is mate there not daft all but essential travel advised
"Clearly you dont watch the news or keep updated. you want to visit thailand a country that refuses to block its border to china, and you believe the figures coming from thailand that theres only 33 cases lol I wouldnt risk it if I was you. No true numbers will show up for a month as they try to claw in enough money to survive the damaging tourist impact that's already started. They wont advertise the true numbers until the government really has too.but the fact 30 per cent of the tourism is chinese and there still allowing them in expect it's too sweep through Thailand like a plague. And good luck remeber to take extra cash to pay for you daily overstay fee whilst quarantined in a sub standard medical facility."
"Sam I am I would suggest you actually read an article before posting a link, the UK gov is advising against all but essential travel to 3 southern provinces in Thailand due to terrorism risks, nothing to do with the virus at all. And you travel insurance will not cover any cancellation costs until the advice is not to travel due to the virus."
How was your trip . I am there next week
How is it in phuket? Is it so far safe from corona?
Its fine ever since they mandated hazmat suits. Gets quite hot though but the good news is you dont need any sunscreen nor mosquito repellent
Im going on march...r u?

"Simple.If you’re scared of the virus, don’t go. Stay in your country. I was once like you but after some convincing from a good friend of mine, I’ll just go ahead with my plans this April. My country has a lot of infections rate and I’m supposed to be scared that I’ll get infected in Phuket? BS. I’m considered working frontline, handling passengers. That can affect me more than going Phuket.If you’re scared, stay home. I don’t even want to waste on money because I’ve paid my hotel and flight since Dec. It’s my hard earned money. I deserved this."
"For me, if wasn't retired, though would holiday in Thailand anyway, but......... I don't the scare would be 'infection', common sense should help avoid that.But having a major schedule or policy change while here, could definitely be an issue.If non refundable, then yes, I would go, being a CC. But.....if you were a CC, and reason being you 'job' isn't a good top paying one, if an oops and you didn't show up for a couple weeks, would your job still be there.If infected and quarantined for 2-3-4 weeks, at your cost.That would be a major concern with many.Would your employer hold your position, are you well liked, or could your employer hold you position, and is you position easily replaceable. Just a thought.Edited: 8:32 pm, March 07, 2020 "
