"Why cant i get a steak, ribs or barb-b-q feast in england like so many joints in the states. Where we ;live its Â£2 for a coke and no free refills,,,,,,,, rip off comes to mind..........Ok, i can get a decent steak but you know what i mean dont you?????"
That's why we have an obesity epidemic here.
"yeah, if you have no control and want to take that option every night,"
Totally agree AhHah.
"We have a fantastic place just opened here in Belfast called Bub-A-Que. it does BBQ platters and sandwiches - pulled pork, strip steak, brisket, ribs, chicken.......! It even does fresh lemonade and coke in jars, a bit like Hoop Dee Doo and the theming is great! We go there if we need a fix"
ever in londons try bodeans smokehouse near tower hill. that's gives American steak and barbecue restaurants a run for there money.
