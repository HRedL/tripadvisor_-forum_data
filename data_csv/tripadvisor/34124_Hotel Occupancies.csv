"Greetings, We're scheduled to travel to Aruba next week for 7 days. We are considering canceling because it looks like the resort areas are going to be deserted. Does anyone have any information (outside with the hotels are claiming) on the upcoming occupancy rates and the current level of expected tourism?Thanks!"
"I would think as long as you’re getting service and things are open, i would be thrilled to have the hotel to myself. It won’t be like usual but I am sure you won’t be the only one in the hotel. Which hotel?"
"Our timeshare resort is expecting 10-20% occupancy. They ask owners to confirm usage of their units so I trust their guidance.As CarolIm said - WE ARE THRILLED to be going to the island with no crowds. Is there a better place on earth to socially distance then Eagle Beach for two weeks? As long as I can get a bucket of balashis on ice, a nice chunk of Ghouda cheese, some of those fancy dutch crackers and a lounge chair under a chickee I could care less how many people are in the hotel!"
Problem is nobody knows nothing until Aruba opens up to US travelers. I'm guessing the occupancy rates are likely going to be much different than now and even the hotels have no idea.
Thanks so much for the response. Marriott:)
That's awesome! Now we just need negative SAR-CoV-2 tests. Thanks!
Thanks!
"During our timeshare annual meeting a few weeks ago, we were told to expect about 20% occupancy when flights begin arriving from USA. Perfect - will be like the old days. Do yourself a favor - don't cancel your trip unless you are ill. You will get to select your spot on the beach without a crowd. You will be pleasantly surprised and will totally enjoy the beautiful island of Aruba and its wonderful people. One Happy Island."
I have spoken with a few friends and their expectations are between 10-15 percent...you will have the entire island to yourselves if that is true.
"It will be like the good old days. The island to yourself. No fighting for chairs or palapas, reservations to restaurants, waiting in line at Dunkin, etc. Enjoy, might never happen again!!"
"@Kat - exactly why were are jumping through hoops and taking our chances. High risk, High reward."
Johnny....True!!!!
Hello I am currently en route to Aruba. We just took off from Atlanta and will be on the island in 3 hours. I booked the Surf Club so we will be seeing soon how empty it will be. I will be there for the next 15 days..
"Spartanguy....please post details about the Surf Club!!! We are set to arrive late September, but are still nervous about the hoops we might have to go through. Have a good trip."
Thank you!! Ok I’ll update you soon
...and how was your trip and how was it at AUA airport. What sort of documentation did you have to produce at the airport and was it a hassle? We have reservations at the Ocean Club late November early December and still have misgivings about going unless things change drastically by then. We've stayed at the OC and the Stellaris annually for more than 20 years.
Trip went smooth... about a hour in the airport and the PCR test in the airport. Considering it’s the second day open to US it was pretty easy. Negative results came back at 5am and now we are free!!! It was not a hassle at all...Worth it 100% in my opinion!
"I am scheduled to travel August 19th. Will the hotels still be booking to 50% capacity then? Seems like the only reason to continue with my plans to travel there, in my opinion. The thought of less crowded beaches is appealing to me.Edited: 7:37 am, July 12, 2020 "
"@Tada - I do not believe the hotels are limiting capacity. I think capacity is being determined more by tourists willingness to fly/travel and the cost/risk associated with airplane travel. If the current protocols Aruba has in place keep the island a covid free zone, you can bet your bottom dollar people will be returning. Watch these boards for trip reports as well as official sites posting Aruba testing and case numbers. My guess is, you have maybe a 2-3 month window to take advantage of the island as it used to be in the early 2000s. Unless of course someone slips through screening and causes chaos."
While the hotels may be open I wonder how many of the fantastic variety of restaurants will be open after all this down time.I am sure even if open it just wont be the same.
"I was told the hotel occupancy of the Hilton will be much less then normal, because they have only opened the Aruba-tower (Bonaire and Curacao-tower remain closed). I hope we have plenty of space at the beach and in the pools next week. I want to keep social distanced from all the people, especially from them who come from countries where corona is still not under control. I don't care if it won't be the same with restaurants closed. Actually I hope it won't be the same, for normally it is so busy at times at the restaurants. I remember during the crisis in 2009 people here on the forum complained ' the place was dead"" . Although I felt so sorry for the local business, I loved it that is wasn't so full with all tourists."
I hope it will still be less busy when my trip is planned for late August.
"I understand people saying that they hope it will not be too busy. I however, hope that it does start to get busier and that at the same time, the island can keep the virus under control. Stores and restaurants closing, locals losing hotel jobs, the taxis having no fares, nobody at the water sports, and on and on will only hurt Aruba and thus hurt those of us that love to visit and vacation there. Crime will go up as a result of people being unemployed. Storefronts will be empty. These are not things, that at least I, want to see on the island that I love."
