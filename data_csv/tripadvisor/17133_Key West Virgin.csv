"I'm planning a birthday trip for my boyfriend. My thoughts are fly into Miami for 9:30am Aug 6th, take the drive to Key West, still looking for hotel options in Key West, then drive back to Miami Aug 10th with a departure flight home at 9:30pm. Neither of us have been there but he has expressed an interest to see the Keys. I would love to hear recommendations, suggestions, etc. I am a total newbie!Best place for a car rental? What would be considered the hip/trendy area?Edited: 3 years ago "
Car rental - there are several options there at MIA. Also look at costs/time differences that may or may not work better for you in and out of FLL. (They have rental cars at that airport too) Also check to see if you are better off doing two one way rentals. Unless you want to see more of the Keys than just KW - keep the car or ditch it for a few days. (Sometimes you are better off keeping it price wise).Look for a place in Old Town for you first time to KW. Hip and trendy? That's not really KW. But Old Town area will have you within walking distance of a lot.
"when I hear ""hip and trendy"" , I think south beach .. not the keys"
For a first time trip you might want to think about doing the drive down to Key West but flying out of Key West for the home trip. You would want to stay n the oldtown section of Key West. Budget depending is where you would like to stay. For a resort type place I would suggest the Pier House. For a B&B I would suggest the Curry Mansion Inn. You would not be disappointed in either location.
"I've done the trip a few times from Miami and FLL, and had good rental car experiences with both Budget and Alamo. I feel both are reasonably priced and their toll policies are clear and also fairly priced compared to some of the cheaper rental companies."
"For a ""hip and trendy"" place to stay that is in a great location in Old Town, check out The Saint Hotel."
"""hip and trendy""...... I hope this epidemic slows down in KW..... keep it a quirky, t shirt and flip flop spot!"
"I would suggest you get to booking your accommodations. Stay in Old Town, since it is very walkable. The Keys are very laid back and go with the flow. I am not sure about ""hip and trendy""."
Yes. If you haven't already booked. Get on it. That's a busy week in the Keys and Key West.
Flight and rental car booked. Thoughts on The Perry to stay?
"Its not in Key West but on Stock Island. You asked where to stay IN Key West and everyone that answered your question said Old Town.Did you look at The Saint? If you like the look of The Perry its getting closer to that. KW is more of the tropical vibe vs stark and ""clean' looking (not talking about dirt clean)Edited: 3 years ago "
"The Perry is nice, BUT almost 6 miles from Old Town and walkable action. Keep looking in Old Town."
"I would not even consider staying at The Perry for the first visit - not convenient at all. You want to be in old town where you can easily walk to restaurants and bars. I would never consider any part of Key West to be hip and trendy, but Stock Island is even further from that. I'd say look at The Saint, The Marker and Hyatt Centric and you might find the vibe close to what you're looking for."
"The reason we like KW so much is that it's not hip and trendy. At least not to us. It's laid back and has a vibe that is often imitated but can't duplicated. Plenty of destinations have hip and trendy spots. But, so far, that's not what KW is about. Embrace it for what it is and what it has to offer."
"As a first timer I would recommend staying as close to Duval St. as is affordable to you . It will be money well spent . Walking to dinner and nightlife is fun and you never know what you may encounter . Hip and trendy is not KW style . Laid back and easy is more like it . But I assume you mean the most popular places . That would be the Mallory square area and the Southern Most area . Personally I prefer the Mallory end as the bight is very close and most of the nightlife is close . The southern most area has better beach access , but still not Miami by any means . Driving down from Miami or FLL. is fun and stopping for lunch and sights is always a good time . We had a perfectly good experience with Alamo . Pick up and drop off at the airport , very convenient . Once at KW you won't need the car much . Many hotels do not include parking so check . And hurry to book , the best deals will already be gone but you will probably still get a room . Just going to pay more for it .Edited: 3 years ago "
"We just made the road trip - stayed at the Coconut Palm just past Key Largo, sunset dinner at Lorelei - great live music, very laid back. Stayed at H2O Suites in Key West - love this place. Very friendly, modern, posh. Free drinks and appetizer at their very cool rooftop pool. Dinner at Little Pearl - great snapper. Key lime pie at Old Town Bakery!"
