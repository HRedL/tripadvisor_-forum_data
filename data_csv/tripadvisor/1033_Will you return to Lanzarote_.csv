"Apologies to all; however, methinks questions regarding our fav island will be on indefinite hold. Perhaps you may be thinking of not returning or cannot wait for this worldwide virus to get to Lanzarote. We know there were problems and extra costs for many managing to get home over the last few days albeit on a scheduled flight or a hurried booking. What are your thoughts on how the island and the Canaries as a whole will survive, or not, a non-tourist era? My heart goes out to all hard working residents and non-citizens reliant on tourism; those that have made Lanzarote their home, brought up children based on income from tourism. We have been going to Matagorda since 2001 and have made friends with ex-Irish, ex-UK and ex-mainland Spanish pats whose livelihood is dependent on tourism. They too are now stuck there without from family and friends...it wouldn't surprise me if most non-resident workers that managed to leave, will not return.It is a worrisome period for those living there...I truly believe Lanzarote will bounce back. If a little matter of eruptions from 1730 to 1736 hadn't killed the island, then surely it will survive Covid-19.Believe.Pat"
"We will be back as soon as we can. Hopefully July, maybe August"
"Lanzarote , like all other holiday destinations will bounce back in time. Graham"
"Definitely will return , I usually go late in the year ( Oct - Dec ) or January to April , with a bit of luck might get to Lanza late this year , though I understand Xmas bookings are high"
This is an emotive subject and Lanzarote is NOT the only place in the world that is affected by this virus it is worldwide and alot of smaller tourist places will be more affected than Lanzarote so no need to be pedantic. As a result of this crisis everyone will have different criteria for their holiday and life will have to go on as well as holidays.
Already booked Xmas & New Year
"Bosspat, I pray that Lanzarote bounces back from this dreadful situation and believe that there are many, many people who consider the island their second home so will be back just as soon as possible. I have had to cancel a holiday there this spring but booked to go later this year and again, early next year for the Winter. (Easyjet have released their flights early at a bargain price from Manchester and Liverpool). My thoughts are with the people of Lanzarote and hope they an manage until this is all over."
"We will definitely return and having visited regularly in recent years we would like to contribute to helping local people rebuild their businesses.However I think there might be longer term impacts which may delay any ""bounce back"" for all holiday resorts.The loss of income people are facing at the moment might reduce their ability to holiday abroad and when holiday resorts reopen they will need to think carefully about pricing.I hope Lanzarote does bounce back and I hope we can once again enjoy its hospitality..Colin"
"yes I have no doubt that we will all return, once tha all clear is given, whenever that will be.Some nasty comments on some facebook pages been made recently though and some might not be as keen to return"
"I think most of the unpleasant comments have been attributable at least in part to the enormous stress that everyone is under. Everything is going to have to start afresh after this is over so let's wipe the slate clean, eh?Although it's obviously been in the back of my mind, it's only just dawned on me that my own week's holiday over on Lanzarote in late May is in tourist accommodation, so that's now definitely not going to happen even if we can get there. I've been so busy getting the facts to others that I hadn't thought of the personal implications :) .I really hope local business owners, hotels and airlines can survive this. We'll have to wait and see what the government(s) can do to help. Fortunately, our local and national ones are just beginning to make some encouraging noises. Not many small businesses or individuals can go for three months or more without any income at all, particularly if they still have outgoings like tax, rent, mortgages, etc.One thing's for sure: you'll all be very welcome as soon as the Canary Islands are back open for business!"
"If they don’t want to come to Lanza , sod them , they can always go to Magaluff"
We should be there the end of July although I would be amazed if that happens!Luckily we have already booked for next year so will look forward to that one.Nothing will stop me coming back as we love the place and have lost count of how many times we have been now!
We already had Sept booked before our trip this week was cancelled.Booked yesterday for Feb next year too Happy HolidaysDanny
"As someone who is lucky enough to spend 3 months or so in Lanzarote each year I don’t think that currently anyone can say more than they intend to return if circumstances permit. I see many people booking flights for Xmas and extolling how cheap they are and acting as if Xmas in Lanzarote is a certainty.The British government has only just started imposing restrictions on the British public and these are intended to slow down the spread and push the peak into the summer. By autumn we may be in the position China is where they considering looking at lifting some travel restrictions. Problem is if you do this then cases flare up again and you have to reimpose the restrictions.Way out is a vaccine but this is at least 12 months away, 68 million doses just for this country.So we could have travel restrictions till later in year, these could be lifted and then reimposed with the risk of being stranded again. Also travel insurance covering this risk will be very difficult to obtain. So to book for December even next March and assume that you will certainly be able to go is a little optimistic, ant this moment in time who knows. As British visitors make up 40+% and this flow could be disrupted for over a year I hope the Lanzarote I enjoy is still thereI don’t think I am being overly pessimistic, I have just looked at the British governments statements and their plans for dealing with the virus and returning to normal depends very much, not just developing a vaccine, but manufacturing enough doses, and then ensuring everybody gets a dose. Dare say some will object to being vaccinated"
"Oh yes, we will definitely be back and visiting and supporting the local businesses, bars and restaurants.We usually come to stay in a villa twice a year in January and in March and already have bookings for next year - including flights out in January with EasyJet - which we do hope we will be able to keep.We will do our best to get you back in business, Lanzarote,a s soon as we can."
"Yes, as soon as we can. Hope everyone over there stays safe and manages to get through this."
"We were due to go to Lanzarote in May and September and we have accepted that is not going to happen. We have had four weeks timeshare at Las Calas, Puerto Del Carmen for twenty years and whilst our maintenance money will be lost this year we are just happy to keep all of our friends there employed. We will certainly return as soon as we are able to."
"i will always go back to lanzarote as i love the place, i have a week booked in October this year, but to be honest i cant see me going then, or even early next year, i normally go march and october, i think this crisis will take longer to get over than some people think it will."
"Yes booked for our usual january holiday,"
"We've been going for just under 30 years, if we get through this I'm sure we'll be back. If I still have a pension pot that is. :)"
"Feeling your pain Rkingphoto, stopped looking at my S&S ISA value earlier in the week after it fell in value by 30% in under 7 days. I've a wee bit to go to retirement but a total disaster for anyone 12 months or less away from that milestone."
We‘ve booked for June and were planning for September. I really hope we get there at some point this year.I do really feel for everybody impacted by the virus but Lanzarote is our special place so I’m more concerned about it and praying it bounces back
"I will certainly return sometime in the future , subject to what happens in my work and social life in the coming months.Uncertain and worrying timesStay safeCheers"
Definitely -as soon as we can. We have flight booked for September.
Yes -well have flights booked for September .
"I've just had my apartment booking for 17th April cancelled by the owners and money returned. A relief really, as it was non-refundable as we'd booked our flights already so no having to go through insurance now.We will certainly return. I'm generally over every 6-8 weeks and will miss my friends, most of whom work in bars, restaurants or leisure venues.I feel terrible for businesses not just in Lanzarote but all over the world. However this global shutdown is required to keep people safe.We'll make sure we return and bring some of the money we've saved from not being able to pop out for dinner and drinks during the closures in the UK. The rest of the cash will be going into UK hospitality outlets when they reopen.Stay safe everyone x"
I think our booked July visit is a no go.Hope the Island like all other who depends on tourism.makes a good recovery.I will certainly return.We have travelled for years but we are newbies tolanzaroti and instantly fell in love with it.
"As soon as we are allowed too, we will be back. The same applies to, Italy, Madeira,and Ibiza."
"It's great to see many of us remain optimistic. We are due the end of September but will be emailing complex owners today to check on their policy updates due to the virus.Although this forum relates to PDC (Lanzarote), our thoughts are with all resorts, islands and countries totally reliant on tourism. If you do have 'holiday' pals on the island, let them know you are thinking of them."
"Without doubt we will return. Really hoping to get there in September. Everywhere around the world will be affected, not just Lanzarote. When this is all over, we'll all be out spending money again. Hope people avoid AI."
"Playa blanca is our special place and we (fingers crossed) will be back at some point. Hubby is in the 'at risk' group having suffered a heart attack last April, so the main thing is to just get through this safely x"
"We hope life returns to normal for everyone ASAP. I am sure we will visit again, tbh we won’t book until Covid-19 is over, as it’s likely airlines will go bust, and just the general economic uncertainty that the virus has caused. It will be interesting to see how China recovers and whether there is a resurgence of Covid-19 when people start to mix again. Hoping & praying that won’t be the case. Keep safe."
We will definitely return but just don’t know when. We were excited when the winter flights were revealed two weeks ago and we were awaiting confirmation of accommodation before booking. We were hoping that we could work in three weeks because of how the Christmas hols would work. How our lives have changed so abruptly and with so much uncertainty ahead. We need to stay safe and remain positive and look forward to our next visit whenever that will be.
"We will definitely be back. We originally were hoping to book for June, but very much doubt it. September maybe - no still very much doubt it. So hoping for New Year."
Had our hol cancelled in April. Can't wait to return later in the year or in the new year. Our favourite place
Yes we will return we are due there the 7th of may but cant see it happening
"we will return ASAP, keep going lanz people , WE WILL BE BACK"
"Yes we will return when it is safe to do so. Our holiday this year has been cancelled due to this deadly virus. I have had an email from Jet2 holidays saying that sadly they have had to cancel our up and coming holiday and will be in touch soon. I hope that everyone stays safe and well and once this virus has run it's course and all borders are open we can all get back to booking future holidays back to a place we all love ..Edited: 7:34 am, March 26, 2020 "
"We'll be back, whenever tourism recommences and whenever Spain decides to let the UK back in. That may be quite some time unfortunately. The money we save will go in our ""relocation"" pot, the thought of which will keep me going through the toughest times."
"For us, not for a while, our plan is to see a bit more of the uk in the campervan for the next few yearsEdited: 11:25 am, March 26, 2020 "
"The people on this forum absolutely love Lanzarote. They are concerned for the people and businesses that they know and love. We appreciate that all holiday destinations are affected, but this is the island we love"
"We will be back, it’s been our family’s favourite holiday destination for years, in fact we should be there right now. I just wonder how many airlines will be left standing after this outbreak."
"I hopefully and pray I will return back in January 2021. After spending winter on the lovely Island this year. I immediately booked again lovely owner but as we confirmed she requires a Airline booking to secure. Now that is my stumbling box, saw Easy Jet flights at £29 , but will they still be around, looking at press after owner has just taken a divi of £63m a gamble for anyone. Hopefully she has my trust and will honour my booking as for 6 weeks so not cheap. I sincerely hope we are all in a position to holiday again here and return as without us Brits this lovely Island could be in serious financial problems."
Who put that ridiculous 'Layover Lounge' thread on our beloved PDC forum?Get rid of it!
"Yes, I’ve already booked for Christmas but the flights are the most expensive ever. Does anyone think Aer Lingus and Ryanair might reduce their Dublin flights?"
"We always spend Nov and Dec there, hopefully this year too."
"We were due out on 23rd April 2020 but Jet2 cancelled the flight two weeks ago. We have rebooked our accommodation (Santa Rosa, Costa Teguise) for 15th April 2021 and will be rebooking the flights as soon as we can. Looking forward to it."
"We are booked for May, August and October, not looking likely but we will return to the island we love, we have bought a holiday apartment in PDC but not stayed in it yet, so when we do go it will be extra special. Stay safe everyone."
"We are booked to travel there in July and for Christmas. We will definitely be returning to our favourite holiday destination,We had returned on the 14th March the day the Lockdown started there. We had a fab week there and hope that everything will get back to some kind of normality for the people there in a few weeks."
"I can't personally see travel to various countries being allowed for a long time until this virus is clear world wide. We are hoping to go New Year (originally planned to book for June and Sept) but not booked anything yet as would rather wait and see what happens. What about the airlines, there could be a few who don't survive this."
Yes we will return spring next year. We have just moved our booking to next May. Can't wait
"Yes really hoping flights are going by September .It weird that although Lanzarote is ruled by Spain ,it could be a totally isolated place. And given its built on tourism they won't want to keep it shut longer than they need."
"This is interesting reading, the cost to the industry is staggering but they think full tourism 3 months after the lockdown lifted so maybe July might be ok, seems ambitious but they will be tourists back desperately.lanzarotebusinessassociation.com/2020/…"
"As long as it is safe for the people of Lanzarote to allow overseas visitors to return then I will be there.I have only had 2 holidays there and they were both last year. At easter and a late deal in August.We always went to Tenerife but my friend had been to Lanzarote and persuaded me to go self-catering in Matagorda. Well I was hooked, such a lovely place, so relaxing and when you get the breeze you can walk for miles along the promenade.Yes, I will be back."
"hi , we are booked to travel mid September , staying at Matagorda , Las Gaviotas, this will be our 7th visit to Matgorda, THERE,S NO PLACE LIKE IT"
"We usually go to Tenerife but booked to come to Lanzarote for September as had heard so many people say how nice it was, can’t see September being likely so will still come for a visit maybe next year."
"Still hoping for our late Sept/early October visit and yes Matagorda since 2001. I really hope if and when we return, our usual haunts are back in business. We will be in contact with a few of them over the next couple of months for updates."
"Will we return to our favourite island, favourite place - er..that's a YESJust hope all our friends stay safe and financially ok"
"Yes we will.Just hope that the restaurants will survive as will never do half board or all inclusive.Edited: 4:32 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"cannot wait to return to our favourite island, hoping for new year. but whenever it is it will be great to be back. i have emailed javier the manager of the maribel apartments wishing him his family and all the staff our best wishes and to stay safe"
For sure I will be back to Lanzarote maybe not this year but you never know! Stay safe everyone.
"Lost our week in March, but really hoping we will be ok for our Sept weekHappy HolidaysDanny"
"We were in PDC in February- so glad we managed to get that break in before all this! Wishing everyone well, and really look forward to the day we can all travel again. Stay safe x"
"Regarding returning, I ,truly hope that when people book, they will consider local traders and go self catering. It would greatly boost restaurant/bars economy and resist them increasing prices."
"Surely you are also supporting the local economy if staying at an hotel? You are supporting bar staff, kitchen staff, pool staff, admin and management as well as all the local suppliers of food, drink and other goods.In addition when you go out you will also be supporting local shops, bars and restaurants.Anyone investing in their money in a holiday in Lanzarote will be contributingWe can all play our part which I think is what we all want just don't think you can assume one type of holiday is the best way to do it"
"I agree with Patrick , the local economy, shops, bears , restaurants etc are going to need people to support them consistently, the A/I establishments are convenient for a lot of holidaymakers but this is going to take a huge effort for all local traders to start up again, when that time comes, they are basically starting from scratch , looking to rebuild their businesses again . For this to happen they need to be fully supported by tourists, hopefully everyone gets behind them and they can slowly build things up to what we know it can be , and things can return to normal and the local economy starts to thrive once again."
I'm not a fan of telling others how to spend their money.“You pays your money and you takes your choice.”
"I think Lanzarote will be grateful for any tourist trade it can get, self catering or all inclusive. I imagine quite a lot of people will be short of money when this is over.Lets not forget that a lot of bars, restaurants and local businesses at home in Britain, will need our support too."
"Absolutely davenjacqui. That’s exactly what I’ll be doing, supporting my local businesses, restaurants and bars here before I even think about getting on a flight to Lanzarote."
"First chance we get is to book a few days here in Galway, Killarney or Wexford when this is finally over. Matagorda already booked for Sept/Oct. At home is priority...I did not say go straight to Lanzarote to save their economy!"
Nobody said you did Bosspat3 lovely places mentioned there. Hope you enjoy when you finally get the chance to go.
"Mine was in no way intended as a criticism of your post, Bosspat. I'm sorry if it sounded that way. Can't wait to get back to Lanzarote, where I'll contribute what I can to the economy of my favourite holiday destination."
"Lol...because of various forms of lockdowns hopefully we will all have enough cash to spread around...well now that we (wife) are official OAPs, we are merely buying food and no other luxuries . Miss our grandchildren thoughKeep safe all"
"We were due to return in July,unfortunately it will be a lot later than expected.Just have to wait and see how everything pans out.Take care eveyone."
"Something to cheer you all up.At this very moment as I compose this...it is raining in Los Pocillos area...alas it won't last.Edited: 6:15 am, April 16, 2020 "
"Definitely, but when , according to Grant Shapps our depressing transport minister not this summer, so wont be sat in the sports bar in the square watching my beloved United or having to walk past the kiosk as there once again is no seats left, or sat in the bagatela waiting for Daniel to serve us a lovely cold pint of lager, but as someone once said "" I'll be back"" fingers crossed January ......Stay safe"

"The Spanish government's exit strategy does not see tourism as being viable until at least December although I have seen an article that claimed that the island government were petitioning Congress to be treated as a special case, as their remoteness allows strict border controls.http://www.canarianweekly.com/?p=53653"
"Just a thought , would the pandemic affect the Transition of leaving EU As would mess up travel arrangements , need for visa’s etc"
"Think not. The UK government have already said it will not lead to any attempt to delay the end of the transition period, which is enshrined in law."
"Can they do that , they won’t have much time , particularly as they cant come up with face masks etc"
One of my favorite places and hope to return in Oct but one thing to bear in mind is that travel insurance (direct Line certainly) won't now cover you for illness related to the virus. So how expensive would it be if you caught it on holiday and ended up in hospital. Maybe free treatment but maybe £500 a day who knows.
"Also you might need after care once you are out of hospital and someone needs to pay for that.No doubt some will risk it, expecting someone else will foot the billEdited: 3:37 am, April 22, 2020 "
"good points LifeGoesOn , plus the EHIC cards might not be usable on 1st of January 2021"
"I am not aware that catching a virus whilst on hols is not covered by travel insurance. Learn something new each day I suppose. I mean why travel if you are sick anyway.Now...real news: the Canarian government have submitted 'to Madrid ideas' relating to easing restrictions to permit local tourism on a gradual basis. More news about that will arrive from Madrid by Monday. So, hope for the islands' economy.Keep safe"
"Yeah Patrick, I read that positive news on Miguel s weekly update yesterday too , let’s hope that in 2/3 months maybe things can change gradually and Lockdown is relaxed allowing tourism to open up again & who knows fingers crossed we might find ourselves back on the island before the year is up ."
Hi Bosspat . Just read Lluis Serra Majem of the regional governments scientific committee . Makes an interesting point . “ Would Madrid be in lockdown if the Canaries had 2000 cases and they had 10 “ .Fair point don’t you think ?
I agree dodgydjWoking. It would be too risky chancing a return until Ireland declare travelling s open again to safe countries. I certainly won't be booking flights although have put deposit down for bungalow in Sept/October
"“I am not aware that catching a virus whilst on hols is not covered by travel insurance.“Pat, the problem is the word “pandemic “ - the instant it was declared a pandemic, loads of people’s travel insurance became null and void. Lots of policies exclude pandemics as a matter of course. But most people wouldn’t have known that before. And you can bet that the companies that didn’t exclude pandemics before will do so on any new policies- or will have an additional “Coronavirus premium” in the same way that airline failure and travel disruption (like volcanoes) mysteriously started appearing as additional premium in recent years."
"dodgy, post 89 really good point."
"My current policy covers me for cancellation if I get C19 and can't travel, it covers for medical costs while away and returning home if medically necessary. When the policy is up for renewal in February I'm 100% sure a new policy won't be covering those. It also covers FCO advisories."
"For those like me who miss PDC this guy is posting some excellent video updates from lockdown in Puerto Del Carmen, see link below....https:/…videos"
"Hi LeyLand10, which company is your insurance with, please? Thx"
"Devastated that we will not be returning in July as planned.Although the Area is deserted because of lockdownit brought back lovely memories of our stay.Hopefully it will not be to long before we return to a a place our family loves.Roll on next year,trying to remain positive."
"Insurance policies will cover Covid 19 claims on holidays booked prior to March 17th, and that includes medical expenses if the virus is contracted whilst on holidayCurrently, looking at all the policies I have checked including my own, ( Nat west) any holiday booked after this date will not be covered and this also means you will not be covered for medical expenses. If you move an existing holiday and it’s for the same duration etc and the original was booked before 17th March then in most cases the cover will continue.Early days yet and things may change.However if we lose the EHIC card in January when leaving the EU and the insurance companies stick to this current policy into next year, then in would be a brave or foolhardy person who travels to Lanzarote without insurance, if you were unfortunate to contract Covid 19 then the treatment could well cost you your houseAs I said earlier let’s wait and see, many of us would love to return, Lanzarote May open and invite us, but that does not mean it may be possible"
Hum...I have made enquiries to my fav complex about March.
I have Sept (50/50) and Feb bookedHappy HolidaysDanny
We are booked for Christmas and hope it will be okay as we have cancelled Gran Canaria for beginning of October.We need our PDC fix!
A light at the end of the tunnel - or an oncoming train?https://tinyurl.com/ybzu2p28
I paid my deposit for Christmas today!
"I booked flights with Aer Lingus for 19 December at lunchtime.This is good news for the Irish market, here in Ireland we are progressing well com ing out of lockdown in the first phase.Edited: 11:23 am, May 08, 2020 "
We will be back. I truly hope everyone is ok. I'd be so sad if I heard people who had businesses have had to come back to the UK. Lanzarote your in my thoughts
Lost the April and June visits Hoping the July break will happen. Probably tooooooooo optimistic.Lets see what the latest lockdown news reveals in 20 mins.  Also any return obviously depends on Spanish government as well as ours.  Well at least it looks like we will get the gardens centres open. More bl**dy queuing l o l .
ArthurJYou have been missing about 10 days so I was getting worried.Good to see you back
"Just a note: Yesterday I was privileged to join a charity event online for Emerlan, Lanzarote rescue service. 38 of the island's acts performed live via vid link. They raised to date 0ver €43k. It is not too late to donate. Merely join Lanzarote musicians unite facebook page. you can still see the amazing vids on the page.There is hope...stay safe"
"We will be back as soon as it is safe to travel. Have been going at least 3-4 times a year for the last 5 years, it’s second home to us even though we do not own a home out there. I need that place for my sanity. Peurto del Carmen - Tisalaya apartments holds a piece of my heart. Cannot wait to return to see Felipe and the rest of the staff there."
"I am hoping to get back next January ,Lanzarote has been my winter sun break for quite a number of years now but this year I was in Prague in January though did have a trip to Tennerife in November last year. Sorry to say I will not be going back there ,just to much of a concrete jungle for me and I much prefer the more open areas of Lanzarote and the lack of the numerous high rise.There is a group of us older folk hoping to make the trip in January if things are open up by then but will make no bookings till we are a bit more sure."
Was due to revisit 1st June for a week. Was originally taking my Mum and Auntie as they needed a break from looking after my Nan. Unfortunately Nan passed away a couple of weeks ago due to this virus so this week in June would have been a much needed break but hey ho it isn't to be.Our Villa owner has been amazing and has allowed me to move it to June next year but i've booked two weeks instead of just the original one week. Just been onto Ryanair and they have moved the flights at no cost so I'm pleased with that.Only 388 sleeps to go :)
"Hi Phil . So sorry to hear about your nan . What a lovely gesture to take Mum and Auntie for a break . Irrelevant in the circumstances i know but pleased you had no problems rescheduling . Hoping your visit will come around quickly for you and your family , you certainly deserve it . Best wishes and take care ."
"We lost our Easter trip to Rhodes and we have rebooked June in Lanzarote for June 2021.We had a holiday to Costa Teguise booked for August. I know it is unlikely to have taken place but we took the decision to cancel rather than pay the balance this week. Lost the deposit of £400 with Tui but feel it was the right decision because in the event we could have gone, we didn’t want to, sadly.We also have a booking for Playa Blanca in October. We will have to consider the prevailing conditions in July when we have to pay the rest of that holiday.All very depressing as I love my holidays and having something to look forward to and to plan for keeps me going. Still, there’s much worse things than losing a holiday at the present time."
Thanks dodgydjWoking. As I said i'm counting myself lucky that I have no issues rebooking the villa or flights when I know so many are desperate for a refund or still uncertain about their booking.I'm hoping that the local pubs and restaurants on the island get up and running again with the 'New Normal' what ever that may be and survive these tough times. So many great independently run places that I can't wait to get back to when we do arrive back in June 2021
"MrsKris, I would be quietly optimistic about your Playa Blanca trip in October."
"easyJet to resume flights on ""a small number of routes"" from 15th Junehttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52751791Edited: 3:24 am, May 21, 2020 "
We had a Jet2 package to PDC in September booked through Hays Travel with the balance due to be paid next month. My wife is a bit worried about going this year so we contacted Hays to see if we could postpone it. They have played a blinder and got it rebooked for next April with an extra day for the same money and no amendment fee.
"Excellent news Blueboy . Nice to hear a positive story and good for you for giving the company a mention here , rock on next year eh ? ✈️"
Hays and Jet2 are playing a blinder. Luckily we always try and book via Jet2 and they have moved our June holiday. Unless something changes they have got our loyalty now
"apparently Heathrow Airport have run out of money , hope it doesn't affect anyone , im sure there will be a bailout , think its the busiest airport in the UK"
#114 Mrs Kris Did you contact Tui to see if you could rescedule for next year? Bit late now but you could ask about your next holiday rather than loosing your deposit.
"Lanzarote moves to ""Phase Two"" on Mondayhttps://tinyurl.com/y92fwqnl"
"sparkybill, we probably jumped the gun a bit as yesterday Tui announced that any holiday up to the end of August could be amended without charge. Galling to say the least as we could have rescheduled and saved the deposit but c’est la vie!"
"Good on TUi, we contacted Jet 2 asking for similar,they informed us any costs would be incurred by us.We have travelled with Jet2 for many years and have always rated them.I can appreciate they are a business at the same time shocked at their reply."
"Had a text from Jet2 yesterday to confirm what we already really knew - our holiday on 25th of June has been cancelled, and we will be getting an email shortly with our options. Think we are just going to move it to next year(depending on cost) sad as we were looking forward to our stay at Lava Beach. Just have to get our Lanzarote fix via the webcams until then.Hopefully the island will recover and everyone's favourite bars & resturants will be there waiting for when usBrits are allowed to travel :)Stay safe everyone"
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announces that international tourism will re-start in July 2020.Lanzarote expects to complete the de-escalation from lockdown by 22nd June.https://tinyurl.com/ydgwsxdq
"Encouraging news. Spain has reported a zero death toll from CV19 for the first time since the outbreak began and, stupid air traveller aside, Lanzarote has recorded no new cases in more than a month. Also, no one else travelling on the aircraft has tested positive (but the incubation period may not yet be passed) which should reassure people that you do not sit in a ""biological soup"" of recycled air when flying."
Good point Malc.
"True, if nobody catches it during a two and a half hour flight by the side of an active Covid sufferer, that should help to put people's minds at rest a bit."
Think it’s an excellent point to make as many people appear to worry more about the traveling than their holiday destination with regards to virus . Sure i read somewhere that modern aircraft today have a complete cabin air turnaround in approx 3 mins dispelling the urban myths
"Until I retired last year, I had worked for a company that specialised in aircraft interiors maintenance and although we didn’t do very much of the mechanical side, you do pick things up. If you are interested, the interior airflow of a modern aircraft would be one of the cleanest outside of a laboratory.In flight, air is bled off from the compressors in the engines – not air that has passed through the turbines. Basic physics will tell you this air is very hot, so it then gets chilled and sent into the cabin above your heads. The air is extracted at floor level, so you sit in a curtain of air flowing from head to toe. Under the floor, half the air is jettisoned from the aircraft and the remainder is passed through medical grade HEPA filters, mixed with air from the chillers and sent off round again – the whole process takes two to three minutes. You will hear passengers complaining of sore throats and dry eyes, but that is down to a lack of humidity in the cabin air; the air sourced at 40,000ft is dry and the continuous dumping and filtering drops the moisture content even more. The only way to increase humidity is to add water but water is very heavy, which means it is expensive to carry - lack of moisture in the air is also why aeroplanes don’t tend to go rusty, so there is a benefit.....Nothing is foolproof but as with everyday life, you are far more likely to pick up CV by touching a contaminated surface such as an overhead locker or the meal tray. Aircraft will be cleaned between flights and surfaces sterilised, but I will be taking hand sanitiser if I get to fly anywhere this year."
Malc Bthanks for a very informative post.Hopefully I can check this out agin on July 12th (always the optimist lol).
Yes superb info Malc.
"I have to say I’m really concerned about Lanzarote. Following the collapse of Thomas Cook and the Ryanair withdrawal of flights and closure of its Island base (from January 2020) visitor numbers were significantly down for the first 2 months of this year before Covid 19. This reduction in supply is driving up the price of available flights further compounding the problem. German tourism is also on the decline. An island that relies on tourism 365 days of the year is going to lose a significant amount of small businesses which will damage the holiday experience. Lanzarote needs speedy, radical financial assistance to increase the supply of tourists at a competitive price or face years of stagnation."
Already booked for next year.
"@ Honestger -- I don't know the basis for your gloom and doom report, but it doesn't seem to be borne out by the figures from the tourist office: https://turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/def…Okay, all the islands peaked in 2017 with a fantastic year, but it doesn't seem to me as though 2019 was a disaster. Obviously Covid-19 has been rather more than a hiccup, but of course the regional and national authorities are both well aware of the need for support. In fact, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura have been singled out as cases of special need. All sorts of schemes are in the pipeline at both levels of government.As for the private sector, I believe Ryanair's cutbacks pre-pandemic were only ever meant to be temporary and both TUI and Jet2 were stepping in to increase their supply. There are already a couple of new airlines arriving from European countries (or were, again pre-pandemic).I just got back from a 5-day holiday on Lanzarote and I found the atmosphere among business owners to be mainly very upbeat and optimistic. Of course, some will close. And they can't expect a lot from July and August -- in fact just 8% of the normal tourist numbers are expected then :( . But the government is keeping its furlough-type support in place until end September at least. I think we'll find that most of the totally legal businesses whose owners want to continue will manage to remain open.One thing that will help massively is a measure that they really do seem serious about bringing in now: linking the obligatory monthly social contributions payable by the self-employed (i.e. most business owners, entertainers, freelancers, tradesmen, craftsmen...) to what they actually earn. At the moment, every established autónomo pays at least €300 monthly, even if they earn less than that. That in part explains why so many people work illegally at the moment.I wouldn't say I'm particularly optimistic as there are clearly hard times ahead, but I am hopeful and I do still have confidence in the authorities here (más o menos, anyway)."
"@SheilaW34. Thank you for your post and the information you provided. I’m sorry my post came across as ‘doom and gloom’. As a regular visitor (was due there 29/6/20), it was meant to point out my genuine concern. There is little doubt that the collapse of Thomas Cook and Ryanair reductions were set to have a significant effect on the supply of tourists in 2020. Jet 2 and Tui are expensive in comparison and competition will be fierce (from all over the World) for the smaller numbers travelling this year and next. It will be fascinating to see what happens. Spain and the EU are not famed for speedy interventions and the island needs capital now. In reality, State Aid is required to subsidise flights but other countries will understandably object. It also contravenes EU rules."
"Hi Sheila , hope you enjoyed your mini holiday ! Agree bar and restaurant owners are generally quite optimistic about the future . Wasn’t aware the “ furlough “ scheme was in place until September which might mean places opening up slower than i had imagined . Also VERY interesting about autonomo payments , about time too ! Ridiculously expensive to employ someone here without being a little creative , if you get my drift ! Would like to sell handmade crafts / paintings just to bring in a little income but the social payments make this impossible to do legally , which i want to be . I live here so should contribute but not more than i earn !"
