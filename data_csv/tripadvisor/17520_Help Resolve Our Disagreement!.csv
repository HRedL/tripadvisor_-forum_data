"We've seen a $145 rt flight from Phila. to Tampa, and we're going to book it. This is for a trip checking in late the night of Wed. Jan. 29, and checking out Mon. Feb.2nd. So it's a 4+ day vacation, with the goal being relaxation, hopefully with a waterfront room with a balcony or front area that allows for lots of just sitting and gazing, and reading/writing with a view. One of us thinks we shouldn't book lodging ahead, and that way we can play the weather; and if it's not going to make a difference as to whether we can lie out on beach or even perhaps swim, then we can go somewhere closer to Tampa such as Anna Maria, and have less driving than heading a little further south such as Sanibel or Marco Islands. This line of thought includes maybe even getting a good last minute deal. The other of us thinks we need to book ahead somewhere or we're risking not getting a waterfront view at all and that's an important part of this vacation. We agreed to post about this both here and Fodors and see what people say, so those of you with experience about these things and about Florida lodging, which do you vote for?!"
From Philly to Tampa is a long way to travel without hotel reservations.
"Sanibel and Marco are likely to be jammed. Despite the raging flu epidemic, this is looking like the busiest winter in years, thanks in part to low gas prices. I would check for room availabilities now."
It's a great plan as long as you enjoy weighing the pros and cons of a low-rent fleabag hotel or sleeping on a parkbench.I live here and wouldn't dream of traveling in high season without a reservation (and I at least have the option of driving home to my own bed if I had to)
"It's a great plan. Why wouldn't you want to spend a great deal of your vacation time driving around an unfamiliar area looking for a hotel you know nothing about based on the weather--which could change in the next hour?Seriously, everyone makes reservations on-line now. It is very busy in Florida--there was a recent thread in the Sanibel forum about the bridge taking 45 minutes to cross. Things that are last minute are not going to be the best choice of rooms. You will probably get something less than desirable, or pay over the top prices. The middle ground--good rooms at a good price--are booked ahead.If it were me, I would book something before I booked the flight. Book something you can cancel, reading all the T & Cs, and then look to see if you can find something better.For your dates, only about 1/4 of Anna Marie hotels are still available, and you will likely pay much more than your plane tickets."
"Dont be silly, make a reservation.As for the gulf coast and weather, this time of year the weather will be the same. Sure further south might be a few degF warmer, but any rain coming will hit both. Only difference is the further north you are the faster you will get it (and the faster it will go)."
"You can cancel hotels with 24 hours notice, so theres no risk in booking. You will have an accurate weather report 24 hours ahead (usually, lol). Your real weather concern should be about snow or ice affecting your flights at that time of year"
"I'd book a hotel now that you can cancel. As your trip approaches, check the weather, decide where you'd like to be, then, check availability of hotels in that location. If there are a couple places you like with good availability, I'd be willing to wing it."
"I guess you got your answer LOL. By the way, I agree with the other posters. Not booking something this time of the year would be rather silly."
"You can cancel hotels with 24 hours notice, so theres no risk in booking________________________________Not all hotels, not all rates. Some of the cheaper rates will be nonrefundable. Read the T & Cs before you book. Last hotel I booked had to be canceled not 24 hours, but 4 days in advance."
"Thanks, everyone, for helping me convince my husband - some outside voices were needed!"
