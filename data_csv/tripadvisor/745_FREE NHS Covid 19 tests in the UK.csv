"I am posting this as new Topic because it is SO important to those travelling from the UKIt has already been posted in the Topic on 'Covid 19 test before leaving the UK ' but may be 'buried' there Since I booked my two tests ( without telling a white lie) a month ago ... the website booking process has changed ...and a key part of it only in the past few days There is now a lot more information requested ... this seems to be to assist NHS Track and TraceThe key point however is that you can now click on the dot that says you have NO symptoms and still continue on to book a testPreviously ( I tested this just a few days ago ) you were allowed to go no further had to exit the site I have just tested this 3 times and it worked on all 3 attempts I did this just before 12 noon and I had the choice of 8 centre between 5 and 14 miles away from my home. Others on this Forum have also done the same i could have booked an appointment for between 12:00 and 12:30 ...so I could possibly have done this outside the test centre and then walked straight in !!!!Most test centres seem to be open until 20:00My nearest centre in Slough had over 1500 slots available over the next 5 days The much bigger centre LHR ( the one I used in June ) today had over 18500 slots over the next 5 day !!!When I went ...and others have reported the same my results were Emailed and texted back to me in about 28 hours ...test time around 16:00Not sure how this would work if on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday ...mine were Monday and Wednesday There is what looks like a central phone number( 0300 303 2713) ...so maybe they can advise I am not sure why this aspect of booking a free test has changed .... but maybe this is the way the Government / NHS is starting community testing with making a big fuss about it If this is the case ...AT LAST !!! - this is the way to get on top of this virusI do not do Facebook ...but maybe there is someone here who does !!!"
"Yes I noticed this a couple of days ago that you could do that which is great. My only worry now is that we fly on a Sunday depart UK 11.20 and arrive in Barbados at 15.05 local time which will be 20.05 UK time. Even if I book the last slot on the Thurs night the sample is going to be taken before 8pm, so too early, and I think first thing on Fri morning would be too late to get the results. I'm hoping things have changed prior to end of Sept when we go. Even if it went back to 72 hours prior to departure would help, that would be mean we could book a test for 11.30 on Thurs, would stand more chance of getting the results in time."
"Thank you, Here is hoping we have the same availability in the north for such a quick turn around"
"Hi MDP, really uesful information, I think your assumptions are correct. My nearest is Reading, Royal Berks Hospital, I may do a test run next week ahead of my travel date in August. Good news that the turn around on tests is swift too - and better than Private - I expect the NHS has the priority in the labs ?"
Denise ... .... the NHS laboratories MAY have more extended hours than the ones used by the private testers .... maybe call that number ????
I work in a school and over the past few weeks there have been a couple of children and a staff member who needed tests and coincidentally were all on a Friday. All went to drive in centres and were emailed the test results by Saturday night so it does seem possible to get results over the weekend. Thankfully all were negative despite having a temperature and/or sore throat.Donna
Lesley ... I have just used the post code of a friend in Oldham ... 6 sites available .... as from 13:00 .... plus one with 13000+ slots in ManchesterJoe ...you can do a dummy application - with out actually having to book
Donna ....Thanks for that - so very useful to know Seems as though they do a mass Email / test in the evening !!Back then 'essential' workers could get a free test without symptoms
"#1 Denise - I have looked at the Requirements for Entry in Barbados booklet and it is clear.""To be considered for process fast-tracking upon arrival, persons with a negative COVID-19 PCR test result taken within 72 hours prior to travel, are encouraged to travel with proof of these results.""In the BTMI Health and Safety Commercial Travel and Visitor Arrivals document the paragraph is:Persons travelling to Barbados are strongly encouragedto take a COVID-19 PCR Test from an accredited orcertified facility/laboratory. Relevant accreditingbodies and standards include: ISO:15189, CAP, UKAS orequivalent. Tests should be done within 72 hours priorto travel to Barbados. Test results should be submittedelectronically and travellers should also bring a copy oftest results with them. Submitted tests must be validatedby the Ministry of Health and Wellness in Barbados. Testresults will not be validated unless they bear the name ofthe traveller.It also says that filling the ED form should take place at least 24 hours prior to travel and this must mean that the arrival time is not when either the 24 hours or 72 hours stops, but the departure time."
FlyingJohn not sure if this is where you posted from but yes I keep checking this:https:/…covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020Apparently it has changed a couple of times since it was first published.Will see what develops over the few weeks as more and more tourists start arriving.
I got it from this folder on Dropbox which is linked to by the GIS site:https:/…
"Many thanks for this information. Very helpful.So just to clarify, what is currently the maximum number of hours (before your flight's UK departure time) that you have to have the test in the UK ?"
Thanks I will keep an eye on both.
It reads as 72 max to me.
"Bajan BAt the moment it says 72 hours prior to arrival. So I understand it to mean, for example, my flight is due to land at 20.05 UK time (15.05 local time) on a Sun so I will need to have the test no earlier than Thurs 20.05.So from departure time you will need to reduce the 72 hours by the length of the flight."
Has this changed - I was sure it was 72 hours prior to departure ? People on the Saturday BA flight were tested at 11.30am on the Wednesday and were permitted entry on Saturday on arrival
"https:/…covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020Number 6 on this. I could be wrong, but I think someone said on an earlier post on one of the topics on here, that it has changed. Originally saying from departure to now saying from arrival."
"Mdp... great post. Hopefully it’ll clarify a few things for some. Testing is a big part of winning this battle and the more people are aware of his easy it is to do this in the UK, the better. I’m hoping the Barbados government make it clear that all visitors will need proof on arrival, if you give people the option of being tested on arrival, some will take that offer up at the expense of responsible travellers who will then have to quarantine if someone tests positive."
"Very useful info mdp. I have been one poster bothered about what you have to say to get a free test in the UK, and find this reassuring. I know someone who has to do it for next weekend so will report back..."
"Sorry to repeat myself on different posts but just wanted to put it out there that there appears to be two sets of ""rules"" on the 72 hours.On https:/…covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020It states on the list of protocols (dated 16 July 2020)""Persons from medium risk countries will require a Covid 19 PCR test 72 hours prior to arrival in Barbados""BUTOn here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/enuf88c41cpfxgy/AADbRrv_yE46vCKtCHh7a5xTa?dl=0&preview=BARBADOS+TRAVEL+PROTOCOLS.pdfIt states""To be considered for process fast tracking upon arrival, persons with a negative Covid 19 PCR test result, taken within 72 hours prior to travel, are encouraged to travel with proof of these results""So I wonder which one is correct!!Hopefully it will become clear once the new protocols are released."
"This has also just been released by the FCO :Updated UK government advice : If you arrive in Barbados without a negative test for COVID-19, that meets Barbados’ entry requirements you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival. You will need to quarantine until the test results are provided. This can take a maximum of 48 hours.Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be placed in isolation until they have recovered.You may also be required to quarantine at any stage of your stay if the Barbados authorities deem that you have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual.Full details can be found on the Visit Barbados website. You should read the requirements before departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice."
"Also this has just been posted Communication received from British Airways 22nd July 2020 - It’s now mandatory that you take a PCR Covid-19 test when arriving into Barbados. Customers who’ve tested negative for Covid-19 before departure, won’t need to take the test on arrival.PCR Covid-19 tests aren’t currently available through the NHS for travel purposes, however there are a number of medical providers which offer home testing through accredited laboratories. We recommend using a company that provides test results through a secure online portal, with an email link allowing you to show proof of your test results. Before you depart, you will also need to complete a Health Declaration Form online. If you arrive at check-in without submitting this form, you won’t be able to board your flight."
"""""""PCR Covid-19 tests aren’t currently available through the NHS for travel purposes,""""""Strictly true I suppose if you included the word travel purposes ...but equally BA could be unaware of the actual situation regarding free test without symptoms"
"I agree with Sunflower, Post 17 : that the Barbados Govt should insist on all passengers having the test and results before they depart, other wise you could catch the virus from some infected person sitting near you on the plane or if not, in any case have to stay in isolation etc if an infected fellow passenger tests positive in Barbados."
"Beachandsea .....I posted about having a negative test before flying a few days ago ..... before it was apparent that you could get a free NHS test without declaring symptomsWhilst we do need confirmation and more absolute evidence that the test results from the NHS are back with you in 24 - 48 hours ...even over a weekend ...... it does make it easier to get your test results in time The ultimate solution is of course a reliable accurate rapid test that is done and processed in say less than 30 mins. The technology to do this is available in the UK and Canada ...and may be countries but the authorities seem reluctant to introduce it Another lost opportunity to build up our test data One of the issues about any testing is the infections period .... .nhs.uk gives the following info ... days from when symptoms started:Days 1 to 4 Book a drive-through or walk-through test at a test site or order a home test kit.Order the kit by 3pm on day 4 to make sure you can do the test in the first 5 days.Day 5 Book a test at a test site. It's too late to order a home test kit.Day 6 onwards It's too late for a test.However, many of the 'experts' are saying that you could be infectious from day 4 - 11Difficult !!!!"
"Can anyone comment on how long it has taken them to get their results back? I have just called the contact centre and it said it can take up to 72 hours to receive results back but results are still generated over the weekendI will (hopefully) be flying to Barbados on a Saturday morning arriving around 3pm, I am just trying to figure out when would be the best time to take the test to still be within the 72 hour window required for Immigration and to actually receive my results to confirm that I have a negative test on the pre arrival form that needs to be completed at lease 24 hours before travel."
"From what I have read recently, I would be aiming to have it between 3 and 6pm on the Wednesday afternoon if I were you. Hopefully you should get tests back on Friday morning if you're one of the lucky ones."
"Thank you very much Clare B. Would this be valid on arrival as the plane is set to land at 3pm which is 8pm UK time on Saturday, so surely this will be outside of the 72hours? or am I overthinking it by factoring in the time difference?"
"Hi #25 and #26 - you may be right, but we are 5 hours ahead of Barbados in the UK, so you really want an 8pm test or a really early one on Thursday. This regulation is not at all well thought through in terms of what is possible. As mpd says it is all really very difficult to justify any particular timing in terms of infection, but this timing asked for by Barbados only works for people who live West of the Atlantic and most of them are the very people not wanted in the country right now,The real question is ""did everyone on the last 2 BA flights have tests taken 72 hours before the flight left or 72 hours before it landed?"" I have a feeling that if only 69 out of 220 on flight 1 had no test then it was before the flight left. Does anyone know? What about Tuesday's? Do we have any stas on that?"
"I agree, that it would be 8pm, but there are slots at many sites that are 7.30pm - 8pm."
"I think you are overworrying...I think as long as it is 72 hours before ""barbados time"", they will be OK with that."
"A family member had a test yesterday and received the results back today, so it can be swift. Also re the 72 hours - we have a guest on the Tuesday flight that did the test at 11.00am Saturday - 72 hours prior to departure on the Tuesday - however the PDF stated 00.00 as the time - which was more than 72 hours prior to departure - this was no problem for Barbados immigration - main thing is to have a negative test before you fly"
Thank you so much everyone
"Beautiful Tee ..... and any others trying to work this out I don't think anything is guaranteed in the world of Covid testing !!!!There is however some increasing factual evidence that the NHS test is frequently returned in just over 24 hours. Now know of about 26 people ...on this forum and amongst my own contacts that have had the test and only 4 of them have reported more than next day ...it seems they send out the results in the evening of the next day Importantly, it also seems that the NHS report back over the weekend. I only know 2 people who were tested over the weekend ...one on a Friday afternoon - back Saturday evening and one Saturday morning - result back Monday morning ...but on his own admission he had his phone off for all of Sunday !!!! I would suggest the NHS are quoting 72 hours as a safety net ....and certainly in the early days (before the military got involved) there were plenty of reports of 72 hours +If I was going to Barbados I would personally work on 48 hours - knowing that you have a fall back of being tested at GAEdited: 2:32 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"If I was going to Barbados I would personally work on 48 hours - knowing that you have a fall back of being tested at GATo be clear, if you were traveling on the Saturday BA Flight at 11.00, you would get advise getting the test on the Wednesday at 11.30am ish ? but allow 48 hours for the NHS result ?"
"Joe ..... not yet worked out the implications of or an exact timetable for the '72 hours before ... which has to take in flight time and a time difference and any flight delays !!!!Is it still within 72 hours of ARRIVAL ???? ...if so you have to work back from that ...adjusting for time differences and flight time !!!If so ...you have to take the schedules arrival time and then work back 72 hours from that and then adjust for the 5 hours time difference11:00 on a Wednesday MAY mean that the 72 hours may have been exceeded by the time you arrive at GAPersonally I would go for 11:00 Thursday or maybe very late on the WednesdayGood Luck !!!Edited: 7:54 am, July 24, 2020 "
"Thank you for your input mdp963I have decided to test at 8am on Thursday with hopes I would have results before take off on Saturday and in worst case scenario I can get tested again at GA.Edited: 8:05 am, July 24, 2020 "
"deleted(answered my own question)Edited: 9:06 am, July 24, 2020 "
"Hi MDP - I was under the impression it was 72 hours prior to departure, I had better double check. This week, we have guests that were Tested Saturday and arrived Tuesday - they paid for the test, but the fact is was dated outside the 72 hours of departure, but immigration had no issue. I would prefer not to take the chance, the idea of a test on the Thursday morning, would have ne nervous relying on it coming back Friday, I think the wednesday evening option gives more lea way. Perhaps there is lea way with immigration, assuming you have the 'recent' negative"
Beautiful Tee ....Glad to have been of help .... 08:00 on Thursday would seem a good bet to me . Hopefully results by Friday evening ...or maybe even as you arrive at GAFor anyone interested ....I have had a look at these time scales .... you can ignore the flight time ... it is just the UK time compared with Barbados The BA flights are both due to arrive at BGI at 15:05 ... which is actually 20.05 in the UK So... IF it is ARRIVAL time at BGI then for Saturday arrivals.......24 hours is 20.05 Friday48 hours is 20:05 Thursday 72 hours is 20:05 Wednesday If arrival is on the Tuesday ....24 hours is 20:05 Monday48 hours is 20:05 Sunday72 hours is 20:05 Saturday All a bit in convenient really as the last slot in most test stations is 19:30>20:00 and the results MOSTLY seem to arrive in the evening around 20:00 !!!Particularly tricky if the flight is for any reason late ... but it could help if you test on a Thursday and you result could arrive whilst you are in the air Is there decent WiFi or 4G in the terminal ????...and lets hope they don't change the rules to make it more difficult from the UK
Joe ... I have not waded through the 100s of posts on whether it is arrival time at BGI or departure time from LGW !!!I thought the Protocol had changed to be arrival time but I may be wrong If it is departure from UK it makes it easier to work out !!!
"Can I ask about Insurance on this thread, as for me these are linked. Have any would-be travellers been able to access insurance that will cover them for either COVID or COVID related issues? In my mind, everyone would test negative, but given were are a group of 6, I wonder what would happen if in fact anyone was positive? Of course we would never travel ill, but if you got a positive result right before you were booked to go is there any insurance back up? This could forfeit a great deal of money to accommodation, which in fairness would need to be paid because it would be short notice. The numbers here are low, but I am too faint of heart to travel without insurance coverage...."
"Thanks for the info above. We are travelling imminently. We paid for a test on Weds and got a result on Thurs for a flight on Sat (tomorrow). That put us exactly on the 72 hr limit. With Tropical Storm Gonzalo our flight has been delayed by 22hrs. The delay notification email from British Airways says ""We understand the Health Declaration Form .....will remain valid"". I assume this means that they will resepct tests that would have been in date, since its practically impossible to get re-tested now and the plane is full, so they woyld have to do ~250 test on arrival otherwise. The posts above suggests Barbados Immigration are reasonably pragmatic so I am hoping this is indeed correct.On a seperate point, there is very little on our results certificate about the accreditation status of the lab that did our tests (even though they assure me it is is UKAS certified to ISO15189) . Does anyone have any experience of immigration asking for specific credentials? Thanks in advance.Edited: 3:12 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"Mdp, thanks for the info. Greatly appreciate all the work you’ve done researching. I just tried it and it seemed straightforward enough. We’re not due to travel until the end of October and things could change but I’ll keep reading the forum for all the good posts that are so helpful."
"Does any one know please, if there could be a complication traveling to Barbados in August from the UK, when we have also travelled to Sicily earlier in the month ? I am assuming this should not be an issue, as Italy is also counted as a Medium Risk Country along with the UK by the Barbados Government..."
"Mike W .... do you have the name /details of the laboratory that processed the test .... you could then Google it to check their status I would think that the vast majority if not all will be ISO rated ... it would be difficult for them to operate without itNo reports on this Forum that I have seen about being asked to prove the accreditation of the testGood Luck ,...when you eventually get there please let us know how you get on !!!"
Thanks for the insurance input-- it sounds as I fear that we may be out of luck for a bit of time yet. The world simply needs this vaccine for so many important reasons...
"Visit Barbados website now says 72 hours before departure..... much easier to work out !!!Edited: 7:53 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Thanks to everyone for the great advice. I have a question, as the NHS test is an email and text message and not an actual “certificate” is that accepted? Do you simply show the email?"
Amete ...last update I recollect was that you need to have a printout ...which you can do from the Email...but ...it does not show date of test ...just the result When you book a test online ...you also get an Email which does have date & time and a bar code ..so I would take a printout of that But also check other topics where there are reports of the actual process at Grantly Adams...and it could all change again !!!
"Hi, MIKE W just wondered how you got on with your NHS COVID-19 certificate? Was it enough to get into Barbados?Thanks in advanceEdited: 2:00 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"I flew out yesterday with an NHS test, I took the original booking with date time and QR code, a receipt which has a barcode on it and the result. The authorities were very happy with these papers and I think they are familiar with an NHS test rather than a private clinic test.Through the airport with all checks in about 15 minutes! Had all print outs in hand."
Ruth B ..... yes ... many thanks for posting about your success with the printed NHS paperwork Reassuring to know that it all worked as predicted .... a number of forum members have been asking if it would work that way
HI. I am getting my NHS COVID test today. I fly out on Thursday at 11am. Do you get provided with an email confirmation in addition to a text/ I'm just concerned that a text result wont satisfy immigration :)Thanks for any assistance.
"Spencer - see above comments - NHS is the best test and the authorities are familiar with this - you get an email with the result, but make sure you print this also along with the original email that confirms your appointment - as the email with the result does not give the date on which the test was taken. You will be fine. My suggestion is that you also print the declaration documentation that you upload your result to and keep everything together in a folder so that you can show this to immigration easily. We fly Saturday and will I am about to book the NHS tests for Wednesday 11.30am..."
"Spencer ...As above in #52 ....Ruth B did not actually state that she took a printout of the Email advising the result ...but that is what you should do ..the wording on the EMail is exactly the same as the text ......along with the other documents that Ruth mentioned ......especially the original booking EmailJoe's advice to put everything in a single folder on your phone or tablet is a good suggestionObvious ...but double check the Email you give them !!!Edited: 5:33 am, August 10, 2020 "
Hi MDP - Now I am booking the test I have a question ! NHS says that you will receive the result by email or text. The second question is do you have a mobile phone - I wonder if you click yes and give the number they will only send the text and not an email.Is the text enough ?I would prefer an email to print.Thanks
"OK, so I answered my own question re the mobile number, you need one in order to book a test.The big issue I have is the testing capacity for the centres near by - it is very limited, even Heathrow. Moreover the only option I am given are for today, no tests slots available for either tomorrow or Wednesday. I need the test for Wednesday, flight is Saturday.I am assuming that the try to use the daily capacity on the earlier appointments, i.e same day, but can any one confirm please ?"
Joe ...not sure how they allocate the days and slots ...but yes the availability at LHR has dropped dramatically ..very odd .......now less than 1500 over next 5 days ......when I have looked previously it has been 15000+ !!!Might be worth a look tomorrow and see if they release slots on a same day basis ...??? it would make some sense as anyone with symptoms would want a test ASAP ...???My previous two tests (as with others that I know ) have come back next day in the evening ...so you could risk Thursday Good LuckThe other thing I have noticed previously is that the walk in and mobile sites do change from day to day ...so a new one may appear for Wednesday
"Joe, I think you;ll find that testing for next day (up to around 1pm) can be booked after 9pm the night before.Afternoon slots then become available sometime on the same day to which you want to book.I do not think you can book days in advance anymore (stand to be corrected lol)In plain terms... if you want to book up to 1pm on Wednesday then go online after 9pm Tuesday.If you want to book after 1pm on Wednesday just go online sometime Wednesday morning.Hope this helps and good luck!"
gary b ....Thanks for that useful to know ...someone else told me something similar.....she used the words 'same'day' but as I have not tested it ..I did not want to quote it as fact
Hi Gary - thats really helpful thanks - I checked the system around an hour ago and they have now released the slots for tuesday morning as you suggestedI will check tomorow and book the test for the Wednesday...
"When I declared that I didn't have symptoms on the website, I was only given the option of a home test. Am I missing something or have they changed the system?"
"JPalmer, that is strange, unless they are ramping down the centres, I booked our tests for a place in Fleet, Hampshire a couple of hours ago, seems to be a mobile testing facility. Perhaps they have changed the protocols - I filled in the forms on Monday and kept the page open as it would not allow me to book for Wednesday"
Thanks for letting me know DiscerningJoe! I tried again this evening and managed to find some. It seems like it depends on the time of day that the appointments are made available.
"The website is frequently broken as well showing no appointments, to the point I thought our local drive in had closed down. We got tested today for Saturday flight. Hope the results come in early tommorow."
"This was recently posted by Sjr 76 in the Topic .....Re: Covid 19 Test at the airport """"""I had a Covid test last week, not for travel purposes. A family member (Child) went down with a high temperature and a sore throat (Which turned out to be tonsillitis). The whole family who didn’t have any symptoms, went for Covid tests which were negative. I was able to book a test at the drive through within the hour and results promptly came back 26 hours later for all of us. On the options there didn’t seem to be a situation that applied to us (been in contact with somebody with symptoms, but not having any myself). Therefore we all ended up ticking the OTHER box and no other questions were asked. The drive though that we used was pretty quiet and there are literally thousands of tests available in my area which is Kent. I am not sure if that would be the same in areas where infection is a problem. I didn’t have to lie to anybody why I was there, nobody asked. I would have a problem using the NHS for the purpose of travel if they were busy or short of tests, but right now, at least in the South East you are literally giving them something to do. You can do a mock booking to see how busy they are in your area, I think that most people would get the same result that I did, the time of my choice within hours. They say that the result comes back within 48 to 72 hours when in reality I know of 3 other sets of people in different locations that had the test and all were back within 28 hours.""""""Edited: 5:21 am, August 17, 2020 "
"Hi Guys,Does anyone know for certain that results from the UK Government Test will be accepted upon arrival at Barbados?Thanks,WHN"
"Hi James - for sure they will - we went through no problems on saturday - just make sure you print everything - including the appointment email as it has the date. Our results were back within 22 hours of testing. Amazingly the family next to us on the plane had not taken the tests prior and went for a test on arrival - so easy to do the test, not sure why anyone would risk this"
"James .....Yes ...but there is no ' UK Government Test ' ...it is either NHS (free) or a private test ...within 72 hours of departure You need to read up on how you get a 'free' test on the NHSRead #68 and previous posts in this topic and in other topics on tests before getting on the plane ...it is all here in various topics .... You need to be aware of exactly what you need ... if no proof of a negative test from the UK ...you could end up being tested in Barbados ...and that could mean quarantine ... many many reports on this Forum of the NHS Test being accepted ... but you must take a printout of your booking and the test result Start here https:/…covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020...and read all of the pages !!!Edited: 6:53 am, August 17, 2020 "
Thanks both. I've had a precautionary test before so am familiar with the NHS system. Just wanted to check that it met Barbados requirements. Look forward to arriving in 2 weeks... hopefully not as wet as London!
"Hi All. Brilliant resource of information - I'm so glad the NHS checks are recognised by the Bajan government on arrival. We were about to book a 2 week trip, then realised the complications and was not going to bother... But now this thread has given me the confidence to book the trip armed with an NHS test. Does anybody know if the NHS drive through test centres are open 7 days a week?"
"Just thinking out loud but if the NHS results don't show the test date, and you have a separate email showing the appointment date and time, who checks that the test results are from that date? Why can't you do a test say 3 weeks before the flight and then make an appointment nearer the flight date and just provide them as a ""matching pair""? Or am I missing something? I know it is't in the spirit of the regulations but who knows/checks?"
The results email has a date on it
"Joe that's so reassuring to read. Thank you for sharing. Was the flight and Grantley Adams busy? Been to Barbados many times, but really not sure what to expect this time!"
Keith A ...Yes they are open 7 days a week and results processed over a weekend I would recommend the big centre at LHR ...a bit further than some but loads of slots (check each day after 21:00) and easy to find and get to
"Hi all. How did you all fill in the pre-travel online form for Barbados if you haven't received your PCR test results yet from the NHS? For the question: do you have a negative PCR test, do you say ""no""? And then just show it at the airport once you get the results ?"
"Also interested in understanding how people have done this. My assumption was that I would arrive in Barbados with a negative result, needing to upload to the portal beforehand shortens the timelines!"
"answer to #76 - Hi Keith, sorry for the delay, i could not access the forum from my mobile in Barbados for some reason, on the laptop now. The plane was fully booked, which I think is a good thing and I will come on to why. Grantley Adams was well organised and the processes were efficent, it was quiet, as the Virgin flight that would normally arrive at a similar time, of course, was not flying on a Saturday. I think we were the only flight, once we got through immigration, we paid a porter to retrieve the luggage and went straight through customs, no queues at all. With regards to flights, this island is economically devasted by the government reaction to the virus, they need visitors to come in and spend money, it is extremely quiet, businesses that are open are only hoping to break even and are only opening shortened hours, so they dont pay wages for staff that are not active. The people we have spoken to are very worried for their futures. We are having a nice visit, but it is sad to witness.I would encourage anyone that loves Barbados to not be put of by the unknown and come and safely enjoy the island, respectively adearing to the protocols - mask / 1 metre and washing your hands. From the UK the test is a no brainer and easy with the NHS, both in terms of access and the turnaround on results.The travel was easier than normal in some ways as Gatwick was quiet for check in etcThe entry to Barbados was seemless, particularly if you follow my earlier suggestion to print everything off re the test and the online portal.Once here Barbados is as welcoming as ever and its great to be here.I believe its like everything else, once you have done it once, its not the unknown and you wonder why you even procrastinated !I hope this helps you and others make your mind up to book the flights!"
383KM and James A ...Not actually done it myself but a friend has .... you put it in as a negative test and then take all the printed proof you can muster......as surely you will not travel if it happens to be positive !!!
"So just to confirm because I can’t get a straight answer from British airways or the nhs, are Barbados immigration accepting nhs COVID tests as an entry requirement?"
"Discerning Joe, great to hear your report. I really worry about friends in Barbados so totally understand your feedback regarding economic worries. Have a great time. I just wish the negative covid test was made mandatory before flying, that way we wouldn't have to worry about possible quarantine because of a positive test a few rows away. Until that worry is taken out of the equation I still believe a lot of us won't run the risk sadly."
Graham T ... This question has now been asked numerous times ... the answer remains the same ...Yes!!!Check the Barbados Entry Protocols and take the Emails with both your your NHS booking date + time and your result in a printed format
Joe .....Likewise ... thanks for that summary of your trip to and through GA ......and confirming the printed NHS test information worked as expectedWhen you say the flight was 'fully booked' ..do you mean that every seat was occupied - no social distancing ???Hope the remainder of your visit goes as well
"Lily246. The latest protocols dated 03 August, page 6 section 1V state the test should be done within 72 hours prior to arrival in Barbados. This makes it an extremely small window given flight duration as well as the possibility of flight delays. I am hoping there will be flexibility if your flight is delayed. Most of us would prefer the clock to be stopped at departure time not arrival in Barbados."
"ISOBEL GYou are correctly quoting from the 'full' download version of the Protocols. However there are some contradictory statements about the before arrival / departure issue ..as follows ...UK - FCO and BARBADOS TODAY - Published 3rd August 2020""""""To be considered for process fast-tracking upon arrival, persons are advised to take a COVID-19 PCR test from an accredited facility 72 hours prior to travel. Persons from countries within the “Bubble” are not required to take a test prior to, or on arrival in Barbados""""""VISIT BARBADOS WEBSITE _ SUMMARY OF PROTOCOLS Page 3 /13""""""The Government of Barbados advises that all travellers present a COVID-19 negative test result on arrival that meets their entry requirements whenever possible. You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. The test should be a COVID-19 PCR antigen test, undertaken at an accredited laboratory no more than 72 hours in advance of your flight’s departure. All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result""""""There have been other references to the change from 'arrival to 'departure' ..which I do not have the time to trace at present !!! There are also references to it in one of the many Covid topics on this ForumI thought all references to arrival had been changed - but obviously not !!!AFAIK ...most if not all UK passengers are using the 'before departure' timescale and there are no reports of any problems at Immigration at GA"
ISOBEL G ......also slightly confused as to why your comments are addressed to Lily 246 ....????She has not posted on the Forum since 6th August and not in this topic She did start a topic about the arrival / departure confusion - but this was on 25th July A lot of confusion has passed under the bridge since then !!!
That's really helpful - thanks. Hoping to get out there on 22nd Sep.
Hi everyone. Are the NHS home testing kit results acceptable at Barbados? The reason I ask is that the government appear to be significantly winding down the drive-in centres. My nearest is now 40 miles away whereas there were two within 10 miles a month ago. I'd really appreciate advice from anyone in UK who has travelled with home test results. Thank you!
Home tests are not accepted in Barbados
Spencer r ...two things to consider.... are you looking at test availability after 21.00 ...it seems as though that is when they release new times and locations .... home test kits are more unreliable and produce more 'inconclusive' results than those administered by medically trained staff
"bajangold ....... on what basis are you stating that ...""""""Home tests are not accepted in Barbados""""""I believe you are wrong ...nowhere have I seen that NGS home test results are not acceptable It is the laboratory that produces the test result that has to be accredited ,.... not the test kit.... but see #92"
"mdp. The following statement is current :Only the COVID-19 PCR test, taken at an accredited or certified facility/laboratory will be accepted. Relevant accrediting bodies and standards include ISO:15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent"
"Has anyone actually tried to go with a home test as proof? Leaving from Scotland and aside from the NHS test in person, there doesn't seem to be any 'fit-for-fly' COVID testing available here..."
"Hi GKeys - I was wondering the same thing regarding Scottish testing. My understanding is that we are currently being reminded on a daily basis to only book a test if showing symptoms. Apropos of this, is it fair to assume that if I were intending to fly next week (which I'm not) and resident in Scotland I would have no other option than to pay for a private test - is that your understanding also ?Luckily we are not travelling until July 2021.CheersAndyEdited: 5:26 am, today "
"Andy....Not sure, but I think there is someone from Scotland on this Forum who has used the free NHS systemOnly way to be sure is to try it and see what happens !!!!...AND ...of course by July 2021 - everything could be totally different !!!!"
"bajuangold ...I am aware of that statement from the Protocols and I was one of the first to post on the need for ISO 15189 as the UK standardAs far as I know it only refers to the accreditation given to the laboratory analysing the test sample I am not aware of anything in the Barbados Protocols that specifically prohibits a homer test....and not to the location of the test ...which in the UK can be done in a whole variety of ways - otherwise every doctor's surgery and private clinic would have to be accredited I have checked with two GPs and a private clinic doctor - they all confirm that their surgeries are not ISO 15189 ratedThe bigger issues with home tests are * the accuracy of the swab when self administered * proof of the date of the test to satisfy the 72 hour rule * was it actually 'you' that gave the sampleNot done a home test so unsure as to how ( if at all ) they date the test and confirm the person's detailsEdited: 6:45 am, today "
Gkeys ....Have you actually tried the NHS website ...after 21:00..????
