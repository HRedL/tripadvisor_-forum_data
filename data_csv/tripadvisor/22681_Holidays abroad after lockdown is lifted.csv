"It's all guess work at this stage and maybe they will try that at first.The lack of insurance for Covid will be the biggest problem.Though I think a few will go unawares and suffer the consequences till it shows to be a real problem.Borders being closed in some countries for some length has already been established.So I think the article addresses the wrong problem ie the facts we know already.It's almost work of fiction.Personally when the risk is lower I think locally a lot will get back to a sort of normal but hopefully with better distancing. But people will need their lives back, subtly altered maybe, but I also think that will take some time to establish."
"Not much fussed about overseas after my travels I,m pretty content with just kicking back around Australia  A campsite-a cold drink-a campfire with dinner cooking  That will complete me"
You are very lucky to live in such a huge very diverse country
"As Toopaz says, "" a work of fiction""I agree it is too early to decide what will actually happen. Sometimes the BBC would be better to stick to fact. Same with insurance, what is the chance of you getting Covid 19 or having a stroke Let us not forget that even with an inoculation there is always the chance of something new coming along to make us illI am sure that different airlines will come up with new ideas but if not practical they will scare off customers travelling abroad at all"
"Following on from my post I remember some expert saying in 1977 that long hot dry summers in the UK were here to stay and Spaniards would holiday here because Spain would be too hot in the summer. Also water shortages would be the norm as no rain.Tomorrows world showed "" a compact disc"" which would always play, even scratchedSometimes the future is better left to Mystic Meg"
"I've been wondering if going forward, travel insurance will become compulsory rather than adviseable. Either governments could insist on it or airlines or package providers? Will we be seeing an extra line or two on our booking forms ...insurer - policy number?Considering it is mandatory to have car insurance, house insurance if you have a mortgage, public liability insurance for many professions & events, festivals etc."
I thought travel insurance was compulsory. I thought that when booking with say Tui there was a tick box to say you had your own and was a condition that some insurance was required
"Ashtonian that used to be the case. You couldn't book a holiday unless you had bought travel insurance.But that vanished at some point. When I've mentioned it while booking it's 'oh we don't need to know that'I spent that long hot summer camping in Italy where it rained most of the time!I can go back further and remember when it was broadcast to 'duck and cover' because a nuclear bomb might go off. I lived my teens under threat of global destruction and no future at all. There's still a bunker for the council to be save in, on Exmoor."
"No trips abroad here. Local weekend trips by car only , need to spend my money in my region to help local small businesses."
"Won't be going anywhere for a long while. I think insurance is going to be very costly, I will be supporting local business."
The issue is rather that the insurances will not cover the coronavirus.
Exactly.
"{I thought travel insurance was compulsory.}No, it isn't. At least not across the board in all circumstances. I've never bought it myself and I've been plenty of places outside the US (Europe, Mexico, Caribbean)."
You do read some horror stories about people who have not had or not had adequate travel insurance
You could start buying your travel insurance from none other than TripAdvisor!
Uh... don't think so -lol!!!!!
"Oh boy, the threads on the support forum about TA travel insurance, customer service, after sales etc are going to be fun. Maybe fun is not the correct word but I hit a profanity filter"
"The only person who ever read the conditions of an insurance policy are the person who wrote it and the person who needed to make a claim. I'll bet insurance policy 'not covered' exclusions will be even tighter in the future what with the pandemic, fires and floods etc of this last year!"
"Insurance works if you have many people paying but few claiming.There are ways to minimize your risk. No more trips to exotic locals to do dangerous things that look like fun. Obviously if you're going to some place like the US with high health costs health insurance is important. But if you're traveling around Europe you might find insurance that provides medical flight home more important than general health care.Edited: 2:00 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Well of course inside the EU we have automatic medical coverage in any country, we don't need another insurance."
"""Well of course inside the EU we have automatic medical coverage in any country, we don't need another insurance""However, travel insurance covers much more than medical billsPlus the EHIC card does not cover every eventualityhttps:/…so it is always best IMHO to have travel insurance as well even for medical treatment"
PierreI agree with flip flop man and I am surprised at your lack of knowledge.Let us say that you go to the Canary islands and fall down stairs breaking bones in your back and have to wear a rigid corset.You cannot fly home on a scheduled flight as you cannot sit in an airline seat as you have to lay down at all timesSo you need hospital repatriation in a special plane costing mega bucks. Your EU membership will not get you home
Ambulance flights are 5-6 figures. I sure don't have that kind of loose change in my pocket so I buy insurance.
"I find that there is often confusion around the term ""travel insurance"" on the forums. Some are referring to trip cancellation and trip interruption coverage, some mean out of country medical insurance (including repatriation usually ) and yet others mean a comprehensive insurance package covering all of the above.Hubby and I would never travel out of country or indeed to other Canadian provinces without purchasing good medical insurance, but we may or may not buy insurance to cover financial loss of the holiday depending on how we book. We will normally try to book hotels that have a generous cancellation/refund policy and most of the airlines that we tend to use offer credit good for 1 year in the event of cancellation so in that situation we ""self insure"" for what we would be out of pocket, ie airline cancellation fees.Edited: 4:06 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Lots of people travel in Europe without insurance. Anyway I travelled all around the world during 2 years in 1983 1984 without any insurance at all, no credit card either, and all the other backpackers did exactly the same then.Edited: 4:13 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Judyper post #24 Certainly in the UK and I believe much of Europe and Australia ""travel insurance"" means what you are calling "" a comprehensive insurance package covering all of the above."" i.e. if i purchase travel insurance it covers, cancellations, medical expenses, loss of luggage,a small amount of lost cash, lost valuables etc. And no other policies are offered, I dare say I could find just medical cover or just cancellation cover but they are not common and will not be shown if you just search ""travel insurance"". This why I think we see many people from north America saying ""I never bother with travel insurance"" because they already have medical insurance which in a lot of cases covers them world wide, and medical is the most important part of the policy."
My insurance company gives the choice of either the complete package or complete package minus luggage. I choose the latter because luggage is already covered in my home insurance policy.
"I cannot wait until we can travel again. We had a three week trip booked, leaving Aus on Christmas night. We were visiting France, Spain and Portugal and catching up with our London based daughter.I haven't cancelled the flight yet, as I am hoping that the airline (Qatar) does it for me. All the hotels are fully cancellable so I will wait and see. I do fully expect that this trip will be cancelled though.I certainly hope that at worst, by the end of 2021, we will be able to take the trip and if there is a chance of doing it earlier, we will.As others have said though, the biggest issue is travel insurance which I would never travel without. Hopefully some companies will cover Covid-19 down the track, albeit with a large premium. The other issue is the 14 day quarantines that are currently required. We could manage one coming home, but not one on arrival in Europe.We have to see how it all pans out in the next few months.While Australia has lots of places to visit, they tend to work out more expensive than going to Europe anyway and they are often hot places and I hate hot weather. Plus we aren't getting younger, so would rather get our long distance travel done sooner and leave local trips to our older age."
"""This why I think we see many people from north America saying ""I never bother with travel insurance"" because they already have medical insurance which in a lot of cases covers them world wide, and medical is the most important part of the policy.""Mick C that's a very good point ! I didn't think about that aspect but yes, many credit card companies in NA give travel insurance coverage as a perk and also many companies include worldwide medical coverage as a part of their employee benefits packages. Hubby and I had great coverage through both of our jobs but now that we are retired we have to just suck up the premiums for the medical.Any holidays we may take, once we are allowed to travel, will almost certainly be within Canada and whilst it is a beautiful country without doubt, it is certainly expensive to stay in decent hotels and we are a bit past the camping stage d/t creaky bones etc :). Oh well, we are just grateful to be fairly healthy still and hopeful we can get a few more holidays abroad in at some point."
"I haven’t paid travel insurance for 12 years as my credit card has that included but it terminates at 80 yrs old so as 80 it’s doneAnd over 70,s The premiums are high So I’ll have on top of normal stuff travel insurance if I go abroad"
"5lbarrycMany people say "" I have travel insurance through having a bank account with X bank""I always ask what does it cover and they normally look blank and say I assume everything.Paying medical bills & loss of luggage is fine but its value shows when it covers those rare things like getting you home by a special flight.I always say check the T&C. But also check every renewal as I thought I had a payout recently but found the T&C had changed since I first took out my annual policy"
"I would never travel without medical travel insurance. I was debating a few years ago, do we really need this...the answer is yes. About four years ago in Mexico, second day in, husband got very sick, along with others. Went to the hospital for 5 days, you didn't even get admitted until you paid $1500, up front, the hospital bill which was quite high was covered by our insurance.....don't leave home without it....you never know when you'll need it.Edited: 5:34 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"For me depends the kind of trip, the distance from home, and the overall costs. When I'm in good health, going to Hawaii or Mexico for a 2 week beach vacation, with overall costs well under $2000, I am comfortable without it.If I were planning a round-the-world or an expensive safari or something, I'd think a bit more about it."
#32 It has y all the features of any quality travel insurance— I compared it with 3 other travel insurance policies When I was 60 and my mum 90 (2001) a month Asia travel insurance for me was $100 but mum $350 so we bought a family policy for $400 Ok I went up to $100 but mum came down $150 I’ve had yrs of travel insurance parcipitation
"For a number of years, I have bought annual multitrip travel insurance. It suits us for our travel style, family holidays, solo & couples city breaks & solo multi city trips. It also covers us for holidays & weekend hotel breaks here in Ireland. One bonus for us is that we are covered from renewal date on so, if we have to cancel a holiday through illness or anything else covered in the t&cs, we have peace of mind. When the total premium is spread against all of our trips over a normal year it is, for us, money well spent.Edited: 5:58 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"Our hospital bill was over $8000, and you couldn't leave the hospital until they had a guarantee of payment. Some were in the hospital longer and one family had a bill of over $25000. No I would never travel without it..even for a cheaper vacation."
"I won't travel without Medical Insurance, I had an incident in the US and needed 5 stitches it would have cost me $1600 US. Nope won't leave Canada without it."
The trip to Antarctica was reliant on your travel insurance having emergency evacuation and my insurance had unlimited But it was pointed out by tour manager that something bad ment ship would turn and head back. Two day sailing to Ushuaia I wonder how a critical one would be handled. A rescue helicopter praps
"@51barryc. We too have our travel insurance through our Commonwealth Bank credit card.I could not be happier with their service. Last October, hubby lost his iPhone in Germany. We attempted to claim, but due to a variety of issues, such as lack of documentation with it being a prepaid phone, and the fact that it wasn't reported to the police, as we were on a rivercruise that was about to leave, we have been unable to.The insurance company has bent over backwards to try and help us, suggesting many different alternatives to the documentation we cannot access.I see no reason to pay more than I need to with that sort of service.It is a shame though that it stops at 80, although luckily I don't need to worry about that for a while. It is a problem though if we needed to return home due to our parents having sicknesses or something."
djhl. In the time I’ve had the credit card with travel insurance included I have had 13 overseas trips ( the policy only works for overseas travel and you must spend at least $500 Aud) So I’m so so far in front.
"Yes 51barryc, I think we have had at least that many too and saved a fortune.I was just so impressed with the effort the insurance co has put in to helping me, I have never experienced that with any other insurance.We are also covered for domestic flight insurance too with our policy."
"Actually i have just received a registered letter from my insurance company that they will not renew my annual travel assistance/insurance contract, although it runs till January 2021 and I've been a customer for 15 years.So is a question mark whether such insurances will still be sold in the future."
Pierre has highlighted something that I think might have been overlooked by us all.There is nothing to stop an Insurance company pulling out of offering Travel Insurance completely.Then what do we do?
"Pierre, you said earlier20 of 44 ·Well of course inside the EU we have automatic medical coverage in any country, we don't need another insurance.But your last post, imo, implies that you actually do have travel/medical insurance/ assistance?"
"Yes, I never wrote I have no insurance now (but well when I was younger). I mostly travel outside the EU.And yes I'm ready to travel even if my insurance does not cover the virus.Edited: 9:10 am, May 05, 2020 "
