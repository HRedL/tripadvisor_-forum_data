I'm happy to hear this news.
"10pm news last night reported that the Alderman of the Ward where the South Side Irish Parade would be held (the 19th Ward?) ""expected"" that parade to be cancelled also."
Southside is cancelled too - https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-c…
No surprise here. Even though it is outdoors best to limit large gatherings of people for now.B.
Northwest side cancelled as well.
Virus hit downtown - https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
Dyeing of the Chicago River is cancelled as well.
New York City just cancelled their parade as well.
