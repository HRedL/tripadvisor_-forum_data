Our plans to get to Crete late September have taken a knock with the latest warnings on different media reports. My husband says wait until next year but I am still hopeful.https:/…
https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
Surely it shouldn't have come as a surprise.More cases = potential (and that's all it is at the moment) action by UK government.
"its obvious it'll happen but they'll still be loads of people complaining of lack of warning come next week - been in news the last few weeks now, same croatia and turkey"
"Even if FCO advise against we are still going. Its safer in crete than me going to work in burnley and Blackburn every day. Im working from home 2 weeks before we go, having a test 2 days before we fly."
is it a package holiday or separate? package holidays are automatically cancelled if fco advise against (though not cancelled just for quarantine).if its separate then you can still go but if its a package you wont have the choice. my mainland spain package was cancelled within two hours of fco advice and the email stated it had to be cancelled under abta
Sorry to hear that. Ive booked separately flights and hotel so we can still go. The only reason I wouldnt go is if greece announce theyre closing borders.
"Eximius: safer for whom? You get tested 2 days before you come & sit near somebody who has the virus on the aircraft. Not safer for me, as I live in Greece."
"Shocked that EU has allowed U.K. citizens to travel at all. UK should have been placed on the same list as the US - a country that totally mishandled the pandemic and the response, now letting its infected citizens travel freely throughout EU!"
Have you sorted out / considered the insurance implications EximiusAstrum?
"@Bolero At the start this is very true. Right now it is one of the lowest rates in Europe. It is currently 11.4 per 100,000 over the last 7 days. This is very low."
But 21.2 over a period of 14 dayshttps:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea
“Have you sorted out / considered the insurance implications EximiusAstrum?Indeed. Most travel insurance policies exclude any trip against FCO advice.
11.4 is not true -you can't simply half the 14 day figure that's not how data works! its calculated on new daily cases and averaged over either the 7 days or the 14 days. so results of the past 7 days will not be much different to 14 days if cases were steady over the last two weeks. However given the recent cases the 7 day average will be much higher than the last 14 days due to the overall recent cases being higher than they were a week or two ago.
https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea@Martha X you are right.Most cases are domestic. Tourists are not much to blame for the rise in these numbers.
"UK 14 day total is 18.1 per 100,000 so 11.4 over 7 days is higher. Still true the UK has one of the lowest rates in Europe right now. Ridiculous to compare with the US whose president denied the existence of the virus for weeks. No denying the UK government made some big mistakes initially but they took it seriously and got it under control unlike the US."
"@Martha X. It is correct, do the calculation. That is the exact figure for the total of the 7 days per 100,000.Edited: 10:20 am, August 16, 2020 "
"Jackie B : but Greece citizens are always going in and out of the country and someone visiting from a ''safe'' country like New Zealand still pose a risk. All we can do is practise good hygiene, wear a mask in close quarters and practise social distancing. Stop blaming tourists. Cases rises mostly within locals because they think they are safer together."

That will be curtains for holidays then as Greece total will be sky high
Oh phew that's not so bad then.... I was a tad worried.
by international standards Greece's numbers are good...however they want to keep them like that and so whatever they decide will be the way it goes. I think they see a bad trend and want to head it off...wish our governments in US would do that.
"@ AHLDNOn another thread you posted that:""News reports this morning are no more countries going on the red list until September at least.""Do you have a link to this please."
"Hi @Paula CIt was discussed afterwards and the Telegraph link also references it. The review is on Thursday and so ministers are discussing it now.Edited: 11:30 am, August 16, 2020 "
"OK.""Boris Johnson is being urged not to add any more countries to the quarantine list in order to save what is left of the summer holidays"".So it's not a done deal that no more countries will be added to the 'red list' (or removed from the ""Exempt countries and territories list"").Thanks"
Que sera sera
"Don't forget that the 7 and 14 day figures are cumulative, so totals. If you have the same number of cases every day for 2 weeks, the 7 day figure will be exactly half the 14 day figure. Currently the Greece 7 day figure is approx. 13.5"
24 new cases in Crete today from the total of 217 in Greece.
"But that is still very low compared with our daily infection rate of nearly a 1000. As long as Greece remains around 13 cases per 100,000 then things should be ok. That rate is our current figure and is what the government uses. Crete is a large island and the cases will be spread out. Some of our cities have a comparable rate in a smaller area. I am sure that the local authorities are doing what they can to control the outbreak. What is happening is hardly on the scale of France or Spain. But our government probably won't consider this as they seem incapable of logical thought."
When we in Finland compare this us being a small country with just 11 cases today that to in the whole of Finland and Crete alone having 24 today looks horrible. Next week they will review the situation for travel to Europe and our schools have started so lets see. Personally I think all holidays will go ahead. Greece has done what it can to prevent the virus. Their last resort is to close all borders BUT they wont because the tourists are not bring the corona its Greeks spreading it now.
"are you sure that's right steve? i heard the government look at a 7 day figure and by that they mean that they look to see if countries have had 7 consecutive days of the (14 day rolling average) being over 20. Thats how it reads online as all the news sites are quoting the 14 day figures when they refer to quarantine lists etc and to be fair they haven't been wrong if you've been following them like i have -they predicted many of the quarantines so far?. Many news sites say they are referring to that EU website which shows 14 day average but they want it to see it as over 20 on 7 days runningwhat you're saying wouldn't make sense as many of the countries closed when their levels reached 20 on the 14 day resultEdited: 1:35 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"for example france 14 day average isn't over 40 yet but has restrictions as its been above 20 for over a week and portugal is only 26 and hasn't changed much from that and is still not exemptEdited: 1:40 pm, August 16, 2020 "

Although I have an insurance through my bank never had to use it when travelling in Europe, I’ve just used EHIC. The only thing not covered will be repatriation.

@panditjidenmark love that they quote the criteria and then do the calculation wrong. Sort of like saying the speed limit is 70mph but they were close to the limit because they were doing 70mp2h. Typical sensationalist headline.
"Yep, as I said looking at the whole of Europe Greece is very much ok. If I could go I would go now. We were to fly last Friday to Chania but the airline cancelled. Hoping to travel in the coming weeks"
"25 cases as of 16.08 (one was in Lassithi as well, plus 14 in Chania, 10 in Heraklion and 1 in Rethymno). Still 14-day average is 55 cases for population of about 634000 people, e.g 8.7 infected per 100000."
I think the Government will be reluctant to quarantine until kids and teachers are back in school. Unless Greece surges significantly my guess is they will be cautious until September.
"lils greece will be considered as entire country due to movement within.France has areas with no infections at all (as did spain) but restrictions will be applied country wide as they were for spain and the islands.Greece has population of almost 11 million so cases currently are on par with UK as its 6 x smaller and our cases average 6 times higher - but greece are rising a lot and their peak rate has been this week,not months ago like UKEdited: 4:08 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"@41, yes that's absolutely correct, and in answer to yor question a few hours ago, yes I'm sure my calcs were correct. To summarise and make things simple, we could say that for every 10 million population, a figure of 300 per day will trigger the 20/100000 7 day total, as long as of course the 300 a day lasts for 7 days. So by the same calcs, the UK itself would need about 2100 a day (2100x7, pop about 70M) to reach its own 'target'."
thanks Steve - yes makes senseJust odd with Portugal isn't it? wander whats going on there?
"Similar to Greece but better 121 cases today and yesterday was 198https:/…Edited: 5:41 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"Yes but Portugal isn’t exempt for uk dispite lower than 20 cases per 100,000"
"I think the concern for Portugal may be it's proximity to Spain and how easy it is to get across the two borders. One could for instance fly into the Algarve, holiday in Spain and then fly back."
"""Suggestions that Greece and Turkey might be added to the red list have been rejected by travel industry experts.

"The numbers in Greece are still low, there will be the odd spike because there is more people movement. Numbers are low and stable in the U.K. , the Government announced 6 in 100,000 people last week as a average...however, the hospitals are now virtually empty of COVID patients. People are obviously contracting the virus but the overwhelming majority are not even ill. The focus should really be on hospital admissions as a result of COVID. There is a suggestion that the strength of the virus is not comparable to what was seen a few months ago, this has recently been confirmed by medical and scientific experts in Northern Italy., people are still falling Ill but not to the extent that was seen previously and Doctors now have more knowledge in respect of how to treat the symptoms more effectively. Glass half full, I think Greece will be ok."
Lol. This week will be the worst in Greece should settle from next week.
"Finland decides on Greece tomorrow. They see the 14 day figures which should not be more than 8 per 100,000. Tight."
The effects of the Panagia festival will not be apparent for 10 to 14 days. So figures may go higher 2 weeks from now.
"panditijidenmark, are you sure about that figure? Greece's 14 day figure is about 20 per 100000, and nearly all European countries are higher than 8. One of the few exceptions being Finland of course!"
The festival wasn't celebrated in Crete UnaW.
"Do you mean not this year, or that Crete doesn't join in? It is normally, accompanied by fireworks and celebrations, and all-night partying. As I know from personal experience..."
Yes steve_p53 I am sure I live here but we have many Finns in Greece now with 6 weekly flights so they may postpone their decision. Our borders are totally closed. We dont even allow the Swedish to come in.On sunday we had a flight from Skopje with 156 people onboard 46 tested positive. Now they are banning that route from end this week. The schools are open here already. Return flights from Helsinki to Rhodes costs € 60 flight on 19.08. Prices have crashed.Anyway people are already told to avoid travel if possible.
"Seen the telegraph saying that Greece are safe for now as the rate is 13.8 per 100,000. Hope it continues as we are off to koutouloufari in 3 weeks and praying we get lol. Can’t be stuck in the UK for 2 weeks when I should be in Greece. Keeping everything crossed."
"Re 57. Only yesterday, that same online newspaper was singling out Greece with Croatia as being in danger of being added to the quarantine list.Perhaps the reaction by the Greek Travel Industry to misleading information, statistics and headlines by the british media, is already have a positive effect?"
"We are due to fly to Crete on 15/09 from Edinburgh and were beginning to look for alternatives. Italy in particular has a significantly lower rate.However, the steadying of the Greek increases has given us some hope. As an NHS nurse I can’t risk having to quarantine on my return at what will be the beginning of flu season."
"We are due to fly on 16/09 and are monitoring rates closely. With four weeks to go, the numbers could easily go either way. It is heading towards the end of the main holiday season for families and younger groups with travellers likely to be older and possibly more careful.My opinion is that it has a good chance of rates reducing and we will be able to fly.Also, with four weeks to go, I would watch the trends for a couple of weeks and then change if you are uncomfortable about the figures for Greece. You will also have a good idea of other country rates. There will be plenty of holidays available should you choose an alternative.I hope you make Crete as that means we should be there as well."
The problem we have is that the cut off for changing our flights is 14 days before we fly ( EasyJet ) so we have to make a decision two weeks before we go. If the rate rises after the cut off and there is a risk of quarantine being introduced then we will not go and will have to forfeit the cost of the flights. We can just roll the holiday over to next year at the moment.If we decide to go to Italy instead we will book the day before we fly and will know their numbers per 100000 for that week so make an informed decision. I hope we can get to Greece but Italy would do as it’s going to be a very long winter.
"I'm due to fly on 2/9 and feeling a bit more optimistic today after the decrease in rate yesterday. Too early to be sure, but for the 7-day average to hit 20 per 100,000 we would need to see sustained rates above 300 per day. Yesterday was 147.As the previous poster says, it's at the end of the holidays for Greek locals and a lot of other places too, so if we can avoid a big spike this week I think we should be safe - keeping everything crossed at the moment. I too am desperate to get to Greece."
"Is there a specific day of the week that the FCO reviews their green list or can they make an announcement any day?Due to fly on 29/8 but have to cancel one of my hotels by 24/8 or lose the amount paid, already too late for the other.If I have to cancel, I’m giving up on any overseas trips this year and will head to the Lake District instead!"
I think they review on a Friday and implement any restrictions over the weekend. This weeks update will probably be the last before your cancellation deadline.
They’ve been doing the announcements on Friday / Saturday so far. I think they do a weekly review.
Hi! Do you know if flights from Stockholm are operating ? I have flights from chq to Stockholm for next week . Thanks !
Thanks.Its berve wracking and detracts from the excitement of getting away for sure. However i do realise that I'm very fortunate to even be in a position to go on holiday when so many have lost so much
https:/…
"Due to go to Crete on the 29th and would usually have travel insurance, parking and have bought all my holiday stuff by now, but it's so weird this year I'm holding off everything and plan to have a last-minute scramble if holiday does go ahead. I might be clutching at straws a bit here but England saw a bit of an increase after pubs and restaurants pretty much completed the reopening process but infection rates seem to have held steady recently, hovering around 1000 a day (which considering a 60000000 population is well below 20 per 100k). I think we might be seeing the same in Greece and it'll hopefully now hover around the same sort of numbers - or better still, drop back down. Fingers crossed."
What time do Greece's daily figures usually get released?
"18:30-19:00 Greek time, daily reports are posted on the EODY website"
https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18941…
250 cases today7 day average now 20.39 per 100k which is over threshold :(
surely thats wrong. its around 15. going on what all the stat guys on here are saying
"worldometers figures, average of 218 per day over last 7 dayshopefully figures some others have quoted are the ones being usedEdited: 1:23 pm, August 18, 2020 "
"yes that shows it as 210 as today hasn't been included in the rolling average , that figure is pretty much on 20 I think"
"250 + 147 + 217 + 226+ 251 + 204 + 235 = 15301530 / 104.17= 14.68 if worldometer population of 10,417,000 is used. Others use pop 10,700,000 as the figure"
good stuff :)
"We are also booked to fly with easy jet to Athens on the 19th September.We have decided not to go as we feel it's just too risky in case Greece is added to the list while we are away. We can't afford to isolate when we come home. We are thinking we will just swap out flights to next September, but holding out to see if the flights are cancelled ( it seems very quiet when I check online) A refund would be preferable but if not we fully plan to go next year anyway. I was very hopeful that we could go, but it just seems there are too many potential problems. I know it may all be fine, but we just feel for us, it's the best thing to do.Good luck for those still planning to travel in the next few weeks. I hope all goes well and you have a wonderful holiday."
As I understand it Delboys figures are correct.
"Delboy, you have given me hope. Due to fly out 19th Sept."
"Britain's finest (joke) trashy MSM are saying Greece and Croatia are next on the list. I just wish they would stop scaremongering. They are quoting figures from the European CDC, well created a rough line chart. I am going to try and download the data file and see what the true figures are"
"dew1nter,The true figures are those quoted by DelboyAylesbury and others who can see and follow the actual trends on the worldometers website. Hopefully, those people still planning to travel to Greece in the days and weeks ahead, will base their decisions on accurate data like that, not on the sensationalist and exaggerated 'news' stories that can be so readily found in the media at present."
Figures from post 78 from Delboy are correct as per the download from European CDC. but they use average pop of 100000. I just wish they would all use the same pop
Yes salamander2018 that is why I pointed out they were scaremongering. I work in the data environment and know how easy it is for MSM to manipulate the data to show what they want I downloaded the raw data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the data should be the same over the numerous trackers that people are looking at.
https:/…Telegraph says Greece likely to stay off the quarantine list with cases currently at 14.7 per 100k. Just need numbers to hold steady or drop back down and all's good. Fingers crossed.
"This pandemic is causing enough concern without media sources misrepresenting data and scaremongering.I’m grateful to those on this thread posting accurate calculations so I can make my own risk assessment.As far as I’m concerned the only data source that will cause me to cancel is the FCO site saying no non essential, travel. Until that happens or indeed if that happens, time will tell.At the moment I personally am only concerned with an FCO advisory change before my travel date. I can manage if things change and I have to self isolate on return. I appreciate others may not be in the same position."
"You know what they say if you torture data enough it will confess anything. Unfortunately, the british press seem to enjoy twisting every figure. Lies, damned lies and statistics. Whilst im all for acurate representation so people can weigh up the risks this scaremongering is having such an impact on the travel industry in the most challenging times."
"U.K. press disgracing themselves and misinforming people, what next? Night follows day? Honestly, don’t even take any notice and don’t let it cause undue worry.This whole ‘20 cases per 100k’ threshold thing has been picked and ran with unfortunately, it seems Greece are in a similar position to the U.K. at the minute with numbers generally stable and numbers actually getting very ill with the virus are at an all time low."
"I read the 14 day number being used to show Greece was above the 20/100k in 3 different UK newspapers. They're failing at basic fact checking and causing panic, it's so poor."
"It is sadly true that the media, in the UK, and probably elsewhere is only interested in the sensational these days because they need to 'views' in order to satisfy their advertisers. Headlines along the lines of ""Covid19 figures up slightly in Greece"" doesn't do that.Stats can be used to prove anything. An increase from one case to five cases is a 500% increase, but only 4 more cases. An increase from 1000 to 2000 is only a 100% increase, but 1000 more cases. Is a 500% or 100% increase more worrying in that example?Edited: 10:53 am, August 19, 2020 "

They gave instructions not issued press releases without prior information and consultation with the health districts .However, for a month now since the order was given, absolutely no relevant information has been provided to the residents and visitors, neither by the Ministry of Health, nor by EODY "", it is mentioned in a relevant letter to the political leadership of the Ministry of Health from the Bureau of OENGE.He continues: "" Who is served by the unauthorized concealment tactic, which endangers public health, especially vulnerable groups, if not the major economic interests operating in the tourism sector? After all, this is not the first time that confirmed cases have been hidden.There are dozens of complaints from unions for concealment - silence and refusal to inform employees of large workers who have confirmed cases, resulting in endangering their health.Otherwise, the government has the audacity to point the finger at the people and the youth and to close the ""individual responsibility"" in all cases. OENGE will continue to highlight the acute problems in the field of health and to demand protection measures for the health of the people and for the real shielding of the public health system. We will continue to do what our conscience dictates and the Code of Medical Ethics, which in Article 16 stipulates that “the doctor has the obligation to draw the attention of the community to which he belongs, to matters relating to public health and improving the quality of medical services ”.We will not become accomplices in the crime against the health of the people.

"Thank you Andonis. That is extremely interesting, and very troubling, but not surprising. It has been clear all along that ""the economy"" has won the battle against public health. It's too bad that the powers that be (and not just in Greece) haven't understood that the two are interdependent and inseparable."
"I don’t really know what that has to do with money over public health though, so far a very low % of cases are due to tourism, Most cases are centred around Athens and Thessonaniki (I believe the other day someone said 75% of new cases are there) It’s about balance, we’ve seen the same everywhere that opens up to more movement will naturally have some case clusters and small increases. We’ve seen how Spain’s numbers got out of control because their central government made big mistakes in allowing totally unregulated travel between hotspots and Spanish islands, Mallorca for example has seen cases blow up because of spanish mainland tourists.Edited: 11:58 am, August 19, 2020 "

"Thank you all. Never been to Crete before. We have 4 nights in Chania; 1 in Askifou; 3 in Chora Sfakion; 1 in Loutro; 3 in Sougia (particularly looking forward to that!) and 2 in Agia Marina. I've travelled a lot but am so excited about this trip,"
As a Jock I think I'll start selling popcorn haha :-))witchhazel4 here's a few photos of Sougia and a tune to keep you in the mood and have a fantastic trip :-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBFz4gP7dnc
UK 18.5/100k; Greece 14.9/100k. The difference is negligible and the rise in Greece is in non-tourist areas. How about you worry about your own situation and wind your neck in.
Thanks Jock :-) Love your trip reports BTW
Here's another witchhazel and whilst you won't quite do the whole journey will do a fair chunk of it and it really is an amazing journey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjBHgxpfp50
@witchhazel4 UK 7 day rolling average per 100k is 10.5
@AHLDN well that makes even more of a nonsense of what he's spouting then.
You are welcome and thanks :-) Popcorn anyone for a very good price haha (just trying to lighten the thread up a little :-) but if I can make money at the same time then it's a bonus...….Popcorn Popcorn get your Popcorn here :-)).One last tune and slideshow witchhazel and this time Loutro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZFfcr8LxA&t

"Dragon. do you 'get' that? If yes, fair play, if not, maybe keep stumm..."
I think the my answer was clear. You'll figure it out & evaluate yourself.br
"witchhazel4....I noticed that you haven’t visited Crete before, having been to many of the Islands I think Crete is the best, it’s diversity and tradition still remains and it gets under your skin, my favourite place. My wife has also worked on the front line of the pandemic in the hospital and is now dead on her feet and physically/ mentally exhausted, if ever she needs a holiday it is now. We are due to arrive in 3 weeks time and just want to sit at a sea front taverna with a glass of wine, stare out to sea and think ‘what the hell have we just been through’. Fingers crossed we get there. Enjoy your holiday and ignore the doom and gloomers."
Thanks to you both . You should be fine
"Reed Rover I second that, you sum up my thoughts exactly right now. Hope you have the relaxing break you need."
It's a sad story but 2021 will surely be better. https:/…early-end-to-the-tourist-season
"Hi all, Just a quick one - we were due to go to Torremolinos in 2 weeks but are looking at changing this to Greece (unsure on which resort). I know this question has been asked before but:1) Can you forsee Greece going on the ""naughty"" list within the next 2 weeks? What is the threshold for this? I've heard 20 cases per 100,000? 2) I understand there is a 12am curfew at the minute - does this apply to Hotels too and more specifically self-serve bars? 3) Would you consider Greece a safe place to travel at this moment in time? Thanks all :)Edited: 5:50 am, August 24, 2020 "
"Sorry Lewis H, but nobody has a reliable crystal ball, so any reply is a pure guess."
"These are questions you can only ""answer"" yourself. I feel it's unlikely the UK will seek to quarantine Britons returning from Greece. Regardless of this, you need to consider two things in the event that a quarantine is implemented...1. are you willing to cut your holiday short, change flights and rush back to avoid quarantine2. If not, are you willing to quarantine for 14 days on your return.These are questions only you can answer, and need to be considered before you commit to going.Me, I'm flying to Crete on Friday morning. Que sera sera, whatever will be will be, the future's not ours to see, que sera sera ;)Edited: 6:48 am, August 24, 2020 "
"Hi LewisThe UK advice is issued on Thursday, implemented on Saturdays. So for travel on 2nd September, I will look for changes on fco website on 27th. If you wait til then you will know if they will allow you to travel to Greece without self isolation on your return.Even if that advice changes while you are abroad, your insurance will cover you as you were allowed to travel at the time of your flight. Read the fco travel pages for detailed advice on what is expected. Apply for the Passenger Locator Form for Greece and UK once your flight and accommodation have been booked. Hope your travels go to plan.Edited: 6:55 am, August 24, 2020 "
"@142 LewisH - The rate for the red list does appear to come in at 20/100000. This is based on a 7 day rolling average, Greece is currently around 15. To hit 20+ they would need to have an average just over 300 for a 7 day period. Numbers have increased recently, especially yesterday when there were 283. Prior to that there were only a couple around 250. The next few days appear critical.The 12 o’clock curfew is still in place. Not sure what you mean about a ‘self serve’ bar. If you A/I then they have had to tighten their service in line with local rules. Best ask the hotel directly what their current policy is.Is it safe to go? Many reviews have said people feel safer there than at home. We are due to go in 3 weeks and will go and feel safer, if we are allowed."
Are you Confident about going
"Hi, Yeah we are going two weeks tomorrow so hoping the numbers don’t get any worse. If we have to quarantine when I come back I’ll probably not go. But keeping everything crossed. Let’s hope the numbers drop down a bit today."
We gonna week Friday . To be honest it’s not an issue if it kicks in when we are there . Have a good time!!
"@ephraimbacupYes. If the UKGov advice given on Thursday the 27th changes, I'll not go.I'm due to return Thursday 3rd so if the advice changes, I'm heading home that day anyway.Edited: 7:39 am, August 24, 2020 "
"I’m watching the daily numbers very closely as I’m flying out on 29/8. If they stay under 300 the next few days, I think I will be able to fly out.I’d prefer not to have to self isolate on return but I can do it and not impact my work. I’d have to rearrange a lunch out with a friend and skip my daily walks. I won’t travel against FCO advice though. So can’t breathe easily until Friday.I feel safe enough going to Crete. Cases there are lower than some places on the mainland. I don’t go to nightclubs at all. I’ll avoid crowded places and wear a mask. I can be fairly solitary at times and will be happy with nice walks, feeling the warmth of the sun and the waves on my feet, enjoying the scenery and eating at local tavernas."
"I think I’ve developed an allergy to the word “scaremongering”. I used to hear this so many times in late Feb and early March when everyone was saying “we only have 200-300 cases, we’ll be ok, it’s just scaremongering”. After you work frontline in the NHS and see patients plus family dying due to covid and go through some drama that some of us went through then maybe you’ll have a different view. It’s not “doom an gloom”. We now know more about this that we knew 6 months ago. People are posting some numbers and statistics in here to help other make an informed decision. Nobody is trying to scare anyone. But the virus is still there. Due to go to Crete next week myself and I am absolutely desperate for a nice holiday. I will go if the numbers remain low as I know that I would probably be safer in there than in UK. What I probably can’t afford to do is to isolate 14 days on return. So that’s why all these “part-time scientists/statisticians” (as someone is calling them in here) are very useful for some of us."
"155 cases today which keeps the rate under 15. Shouldn’t go on the red list this week, unless numbers rocket over the next three days."
The official figure is 170 but still better . 7 on Crete.
"Where do you get your figures from Worldometers is still showing 155 , and no deaths"
"It is 155.The figure comes out and then it seems to be routinely ""adjusted"" on a daily basis. The 170 was the pre-adhusted figure. 155 is the number that matters."
"This is the official website of the GREEK government :https://eody.gov.gr/0824_briefing_covid19/.  It is the correct/official one and the Greek newspapers. None report 155 only worldmeters does.One can adjust it to 100. Lol. Personally I think the cases are much more than what Greece reports.https://www.ekathimerini.com/256176/article/…https://www.iefimerida.gr/ellada/o-hartis-to…Edited: 2:57 pm, August 24, 2020 "
