"We're going to the Grand Papagayo next Feb., including a trip to the ""Cloud Forest"".The World Health Org. says that this area is experiencing an epidemic of dengue fever at the moment. Has anybody had any problems recently. Is it a seasonal problem?"
"www.mdtravelhealth.com Costa Rica will have all health info...there is Dengue risk in you area outbreaks in CR sporadically duringwet season no epidemic very rare in tourists who take appropriate biting insect precautions and use DEET orwww.cutteradvanced.com..Relax have fun,"
"Costa Rica has experienced a sharp increase this year in the number of dengue cases. It has been a bad year for mosquitoes, in general, but I think that things are easing up a bit. It is a seasonal problem. In February, you shouldn't have a problem since it will be the ""Dry"" season and so much fewer mosquitoes. I was recently on the Pacific Coast in a small town known to have dengue and not only did I not see any mosquitoes, I didn't get bit. Foolishly, I left my insect repellent at home and was planning on buying more when I realized that I hadn't seen or heard or felt any mosquitoes. Of course, if you visit the cloud forest, it is more likely you will experience more mosquitoes. You can bring insect repellent or buy it here. The key is to use it faithfully. Keep checking the news about dengue because by that time, it might all be over."
I will said that for feb...is not going to be a huge issue... please come and enjoy our country as much as we do!roadadvisor
"I got Dengue last year in July. It took me a quite a few years of living here to get it, though."
