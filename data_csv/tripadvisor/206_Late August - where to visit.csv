"Four of us driving from Dallas. We’ve never been to CO. Don’t know where we could travel (city/town) for hiking, white water rafting, zip lining & other outdoor adventures while still social distancing. Ideas?"
"Look at Buena vista/salida or Glenwood springs...august is late for rafting but if there is any to be done they will have it..whether we can do those things remains to be scene, but those are probably your best bets.Edited: 9:44 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"As noted, Glenwood Springs is a great option.Have fun and stay safe."
"Colorado has a great tourism dept. that has an interactive website with helpful itinerary ideas, info on areas that match your interests and also the latest covid-19 updates. Check it out at https://www.colorado.com/Also check out the covid-19 section - https:/…colorado-travel-covid-19 Who can tell what late Aug. will be like so imho don't make any non-refundable reservations just in case."
