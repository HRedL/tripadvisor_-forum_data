"Having read all the negative reviews and the scary bed bug mentions on tripadvisor (not to mention the NBC special on the bed bugs at this hotel) I am a bit apprehensive about my stay in October. I booked the hotel on priceline so I cannot cancel my two rooms (which I got for $210/night each room, not cheap but decent for the week I wanted).Has anyone heard anything about the current status of the bed bugs? I believe the NBC special was back in 2006, but there are still mentions on Tripadvisor as late as June 22nd, 2008! Would a disgruntled tourist make something like that up?"
"""Would a disgruntled tourist make something like that up?""I don't know, but I don't think you have a choice unless you're prepared to walk away from a lot of money. The best advice I can give is to write to the manager about your concerns in detail. You can also try PM'ing the person who claimed there were bedbugs to find out if he/she remember what room they were in."
"According to the reviews on this site the bed bugs are still a problem, as well as other issues."
"I would not take any mention of bedbugs lightly in light of NYC's epidemic. Check bedbugger.com and the bedbug registry for additional information on your hotel, if it's listed.  I think it's obvious which reviews are written by disgruntled tourists-- things like ""OmG tHe Food was so badd I got food poisning evry nite."" (note bad spelling, horrible typing, and untrue assertion).Like previous poster said, call the manager and ask. If you MUST stay at a bedbug infested hotel, take every and all precautions not to spread them back to where you live. There is an epidemic in Canada as well (mostly I have heard about Toronto) but I wouldn't take any chances. "
I'm doing a contiki tour in November and the hotel we stay at (The Marrakech) also has terrible reviews on Trip about bedbugs. Was just curious as to how you can minimise the nastiness of the situation- prevent yourself from getting bitten and taking them home with you. Should I bring my own sheets/sleeping bag? Is there any kind of insect repellent to deter them?
"Bringing your own sheets or sleeping bag won't help. Neither will store-bought insecticides. Bring a flashlight and do a thorough inspection of the mattress, headboard area, nightstands, couches, etc. Check the walls for bedbug waste. If you see any signs, go to the front desk and demand another room--be sure to tell them why. Also bedbugs leave an odor (sweet, similar to raspberries). It's interesting--all insects leave distinctive odors. I was surprised to find that roaches leave an odor. I used to smell it everytime I entered my apartment building years ago. At the time I didn't know what it was I was smelling. So don't discount using your sense of smell, too, when looking for bedbug infestations."
The Marrakech is an illegal hotel- get a new one. 
good god. what do you mean its illegal?
"If it is an illegal hotel, basically it means that the owners converted the building into a hotel without getting proper permits. Most likely it was an SRO building and the owners discovered that if they pushed the residents out and rented to tourists, they could make more money. If Alice sees this, she can explain it in more detail..."
Alice has posted about this before. It was an SRO and the landlord is trying to push people out according to her prior post.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k1994666â€¦
