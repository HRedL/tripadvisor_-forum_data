"There a separate thread on Official Updates which I agree should now be for that, but the challenge is the lack of official information available, specifically on which Travelers will need to quarantine. This is further exacerbated by the vagaries of an Official Decree by Moscow, which just relates to Moscow, but information for the Decree is dated the 5th of March, directly references the obvious countries at that point in time, but used the inclusion of ""as well as other states disadvantaged by the spread of new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV)"" An unofficial statement via a KLM Letter was (as via a TA Member) ""Because of the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the Russian authorities have imposed new entry rules for passengers travelling to Russia.All passengers arriving in Moscow traveling from one of the following countries are required to self-quarantine for 14 days: China, Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, USA, UK and Norway.""Having been down the rabbit hole and back again trying to find a definitive position for Russia on all their official sites, where one directs to WHO for a definitive list, but doesn't, it would appear that the speed at which the situation is changing, ""as well as other states disadvantaged"" seems fair.So, by the numbers, whilst China and South Korea are listed, they are demonstrating significant progress in halting the spread as acknowledged by the WHO, with China showing an increase of 0% for the last 24 hours, and 0.5% for the last 7 days, South Korea is 2.8% and 31% for the last 7 days, Hong Kong 3.1% and 23.8%, Singapore 4.8% and 59.8%, and Japan at 7.5% and 91.4%.The numbers from those exposed early show that mandated lock down, extensive testing, and ramping up the medical response has been successful in containing the spread. Those following behind Asia, Iran and even Italy are seeing some success, Iran 10.7% and 189%, Italy 17.5% and 291%.These figures seem alarming, but when in context of the later European nations, Spain 27.6% for the last 24 hours and 1015% for the last 7 days, France 20.7% and 580%, Germany 28.4% and 405%, Switzerland 24.9% and 635%, Norway 21.4% and 799%, Sweden 27.2% and 631%, Denmark 23.7% and 3270% (yes only 20 cases 7 days ago and now 674), the US 24% and 721% and the UK 22.7% and 408%.So by the numbers, Europe has exploded in cases in the last 7 days, and if the KLM notification is anything to go by with the specific inclusion being expanded to Switzerland, USA, UK and Norway, one would expect Sweden and Denmark to follow and potentially Austria at 32% and 780%, The Netherlands 18% and 649%, and Belgium 21.3% and 698%.Asia appears to be coming out of it. with China looking to impose travel restrictions from Europe so the virus isn't re-introduced, but Europe and North America appear to be on the upward trend, the concern for the US is lack of testing as seen in South Korea, whether their Health Services can be up-scaled as seen in China with the rapid building of two hospitals, or whether the country will accept the level of internal travel restrictions and quarantine shown by China, Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.Russia has jumped to 34 cases and will be conscious of what is happening in Europe and the closing of borders by the US and India."
"The US has now hit 2,500 cases with 55 deaths, Switzerland 1,375 and the UK 1,140.Denmark, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and New Zealand have all closed their borders joining Israel, Saudi Arabia and India. The US has just added the UK and Ireland to its travel ban.IATA for Russia states bans for China, Iran, Hong Kong, Macao and enforces self isolation for China (People's Rep.), France, Germany, Korea (Rep.) and Spain.With the US now at 2,500 cases just behind France and Germany on about 4,500 cases each, some form of restriction on US travelers would seem imminent."
">>...some form of restriction on US travelers would seem imminent.<<Yes, and Canada's advice is now quite direct: 'Canadians abroad should get back home while it's still possible, says Champagne'https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-câ€¦------------------Keep in mind that 80% of those who become infected have mild disease and recover. The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.---------------------28% of Japanese are aged 65 and over.22% of Italians are aged 65 and over.16% of Americans are aged 65 and over."
"Travelers should also consider not only the risk of being quarantined in the country they are traveling to, but being quarantined on their return. The recent border closings of New Zealand, Denmark, Ukraine and the Czech Republic means that citizens currently abroad face a 14 day self isolation period on their return.The New Zealand cricket touring Australia immediately cancelled their tour and booked urgent flights home to beat the midnight Sunday border closure."
"> Travelers should also consider not only the risk of being quarantined in the country they are traveling to, but being quarantined on their return.---what has happened to me: I came back home to Norway from Sankt-Peterburg wednesday, went to work, next day norwegian government declared that people who had been outside the Nordic zone (DK-NO-SE-FI-IS) had to 14-ine. How did that work, since there's no law enforcement? my employer told me I must not come back to work, so I am now on 14-days paid holiday.the fun is that when I was in SPb, russians were considering the idea of 14-ine for, among others, travelers from Norwaythe other fun point is that the regulation of the norwegian government is silly: all the Nordics are inside the Schengen zone, which, because unregulated travels since all this started, where all being mutually contaminated. So in fact I was statistically safer in Sankt-Peterburg than in Helsinki.Russia is closing its border with Poland and Norway just now, which is quite late in fact. They should had regulated much earlier the flights to/from Schengen. That's where the infection went to Moskow.The lesson from all this is that Schengen zone ie. the EU Commission bears a big responsability, that there was no internal coordination among Schengen members, and that there is still none.Practically, for travel to Russia, it means there's a mess if you have to transit through a yuropan hub, which becomes more and more difficult. Countries do unilateral stuff on their sides without working it with neighbouring countries, etc."
"With the number of nations introducing travel bans and enforced self-isolation, the reality is that it is going to make international travel totally impractical as you could quite easily need to self isolate for 28 days!If you can be bothered, or get caught out having to self isolate in the country you are traveling to, do your 14 days and continue your travels, you could quite easily face another 14 day self isolation on your return home.So the reality of it is, international travel is on the verge of coming to a halt. Even if you fly to a destination for which there is no restriction for your country, on return to one of the growing list of countries with blanket bans, you will face 14 days.Add to that the ever decreasing number of flights, cancellations, and countries that carriers are flying to, even getting home may be a challenge."
"Latest figures are not good reading doing a quick comparison on the increase since last Friday (13-03-2020)The US has doubled to 3,535 up 105%Spain 7,843 up 149%Switzerland 2,217 up 155%Germany 5,813 up 112%France 5,423 up 88.53%Italy 24,747 up 63.75%UK 1,391 up 136%Austria 860 up 138%Belgium 886 up 122%Denmark 864 up 28%Netherlands 1,052 up 85%Sweden 1,040 up 51.38%Norway 1,254 up 57%Iran 13,938 up 38.34%Saudi Arabia 118 up 162%Israel 213 up 95%Australia 300 up 92%The latest update shows some slowing for hot spots Italy and Iran, although total cases high, %age movement lower than others.It also shows the US numbers doubling, so whilst jumping into action in recent days, demonstrates the risk of waiting, something the UK should take into consideration.Denmark, Norway and Sweden have seen much smaller movements, but Germany, Switzerland and Spain show much greater %age movements with Spain now acting, possibly something other European nations may need to consider.The last two of Saudi Arabia and Israel were a surprise as both were early to close borders, and with Australia up 92% to 300 also potentially debunking opinion that the Virus will dissipate in the warming months of April for the northern hemisphere."
"With all the numbers growing exponentially and countries closing their borders daily, the question of 'Should I travel' is now a mute point, as the decision is no longer yours.But their is something else the numbers are telling us, something already suspected by many, and that in some nations, the number who have contracted COVID-19 may be a lot higher than reported.Two nations which have had the virus for some time and a significant number cases, both South Korea and Germany, are showing low mortality rates, South Korea at 0.91% and Germany at 0.23%, and of no surprise, both have had extensive and robust testing programs, which may suggest they've identified a much greater number of those infected.There are also other factors that come into play, the average age of the population, where Japan has a mortality rate of 3.26% and also one of the oldest populations in the world, but also the quality and access to adequate healthcare which may contribute to Iran's high mortality rate of 5.7%.Italy is an anomaly, with a mortality rate of 7.71%, possibly with the virus starting in older, more regional areas, but also that the spread is so great keeping up with testing is impossible.This could also be a contributing factor to the US mortality rate coming down to 1.84% as the reported cases closes in on 5,000, in that the suspicion that the spread was worse than thought was true.This should be of great concern to the UK with a mortality rate of 3.56%, double that of the US, and if Germany (0.23%) , Switzerland (0.81%) and Norway (0.22%) are anything to go by, it would suggest the number of case in the UK is much higher than that being reported."
"For Russia the outlook is a bit grimmer with cases jumping to 147, up from 114 yesterday and from just 34 on the 13/03/2020, and 4 on the 6/03/2020, but is still yet to record a fatality.Latest figures show that the increased testing for the US is catching up to the more probable number of cases.Whilst cases have jumped to an alarming 8,304, the mortality rate is coming down, now 1.60%, and compared to South Korea with the most rigorous testing with a mortality rate of 1.00% and Diamond Princess where all passengers were tested at 0.98%.The Diamond Princess figures may be skewed with the high average age of the passengers, and there are the results of Germany with 12,300 cases a mortality rate of just 0.23%.Irrespective, the concern is Italy with a rate of 8.34% which suggests a much greater spread than cases reported and the UK with 2,626 and a rate of 3.96%.The simple message to all travelers at the moment is get home while you can and avoid all non-essential travel."
