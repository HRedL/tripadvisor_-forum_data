Can locals comment on current status in PV? Gracias
"From my walk today. People in my hood wearing masks up from 10% to about 15%. On Olas Otlas and the board walk behind it, down from 50% wearing masks to approximately 40%. Quite a few tourists in town."
>>>Safety protocols include shoe sanitizing mats<<<I don't understand what this is meant to accomplish. I haven't heard that shoes are a major transmission route of the virus.
"From WHO regarding shoes:""FACT: The likelihood of shoes spreading COVID-19 is very lowThe likelihood of COVID-19 being spread on shoes and infecting individuals is very low. As a precautionary measure, particularly in homes where infants and small children crawl or play on floors, consider leaving your shoes at the entrance of your home. This will help prevent contact with dirt or any waste that could be carried on the soles of shoes.""Very low risk, but certainly that risk increases as hundreds (or more) people enter a store daily. Glad you appreciate the steps that businesses are taking (or are being required to take) to minimize risks of spreading the virus. As mandated by whatever government agency. Are there any other protocols you'd like to poo-poo? Or ignore?I, for one, would be hesitant to patronize any business that ignores government mandates regard sanitation. If they're ignoring one, how many others are they ignoring?Edited: 10:35 pm, August 10, 2020 "

Alunelu. Thanks Karen Ill take your obviously very sound avisé on board. Obviously you are correct. Stay safe. Wear a mask.
"I would not think a mask is worthless when outside. For one thing...people sneeze. For another...people cough. And on sidewalks you have to walk really close sometimes. Also, it just shows that you kinda know what is going on. It sets a good example."
"Sometimes people who are out walking are actually going somewhere. Like to a grocery store. Or the bank. Or OXXO. Or the Mercado. Maybe they've got their mask in their pocket or purse. Maybe not.Here's a revealing quote cut from an MND article that speaks volumes:""Although she comes in close contact with a lot of people during her workday, she doesn’t wear a mask. “I do not believe in masks,” she said. “I do not use gel. I do not believe in the pandemic.”Although she knows about the high number of viral cases in San Gregorio, she remains steadfastly unconcerned. “A lot of people die every day,” she said."""
"High risk , low risk, medium risk, who cares I do not want the virus at all. Totally incorrect that wearing a mask outside is useless. Also the mask works both ways protects you to some degree and others. I have no intention of walking outside as someone passes me and I have no mask on nor do they and they sneeze, that equals high risk. Shoes are basic dirt and grime and yes germ carriers long before Covid. Why do you think in surgery they wear shoe covers. Mask use with 100% compliance could bring the spread of this beast way down. Essentially this is all basic science and the WHO and the CDC have changed their stance so many times, I use my own common sense and knowledge not rely on changing of the guard every other day."
Just a FYI on the popular neck gaiters https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wel…

"Vallarta Daily is not a reliable information source.In my observation, when I occasionally venture out to the market, about 10% without masks !"
"Alunelu, it is wrong for you to tell people on this travel forum that they don't need masks outside. Masks are mandated in PV, even outside unless people are eating or drinking. I'm a firm believer in them even outside if you're within a few feet of other people. The sidewalks are tight in PV and you pass a lot of people when walking, not simply 1 or 2 people in 5 minutes like walking in a typical suburban neighborhood in the US. Something to consider which was sent to us by a Doctor in our family...and it makes sense. https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/07/418181/one…"
"Thank you Kansas. We hiked up to the cross today . Hard to do without a mask on but we managed. . We both wear masks when we go outside our complex. We both Hate wearing masks but we do b/c it’s the right thing to do . It’s not all about us. Next bit of advice I get may be you don’t have to wash your hands. Off topic. For Kansas & Iyam. We had lunch and margs at Daiquiri Dicks yesterday. Finally had the Asian salud everyone raves about. Yum. Chased that with a few Margs and said “cheers to you two”. Service was great and all protocols followed . We are going to try do that every Monday during low season as lots of room between tables and open air. Salud. Stay safe, wash your hands and wear a freaking Mask.Edited: 1:39 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"Thanks Kevin and to Inge! We missed our time in PV in June so much. Glad you enjoyed those salads. We usually order the small salads for lunch because they are as big as a large dinner salad. Don't know how they're sizing them now, but that's been our experience. Enjoy."
"You are there and know how all of the sidewalks are in town? The sidewalk in front of Los Muertos Beach restaurant isn't deserted. What about somebody reading old threads in High Season? You don't need to answer, those are rhetorical questions.""my advice wasn't for 3 year olds that barely can read.""You are very abrasive and insulting. I doubt many people here are appreciating your brand of communication.Edited: 3:27 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"Kansas you are right! Very abrasive to say the least. Cannot believe how he/she treats some posters.Edited: 5:15 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"Sometimes people read between the lines and get it right ... sometimes people read between the lines and get it wrong ... If I may ... I understood exactly what Alunelu was saying ... I am outside every day, usually just in the back yard ... I don't wear a mask ... walking to the store I can wait a few moments for someone to pass safely by or walk on the road a bit to give them space ... got my re-usable/washable mask in my shirt pocket to don as soon as I get to the building .... the other day, we went to a farmer's market ... an outdoor event ... we both put on masks, even though people seemed to giving everyone else required space, we are both older and the chances of straying into anothers bubble was present ... better safe than sorry ... instead of assuming what a person ""meant"", might I suggest that you ask for further clarification, possibly mentioning what your interpretation of the post ... In the past there have been negative comments that have been directed at me ... whether misinterpretation was the cause or if the cork has left the second bottle is of no concern ... I will defend what I have posted and even apologize if I was not clear in the post, leading people to come to a wrong conclusion ... better to ask than get into a war of words"

"skyseulb, I didn't misunderstand her or his post. I get it, I don't wear a mask in my backyard either and if in PV I would pull it down while going for a walk if nobody was on the street. The point is, masks are mandatory in PV. We can't dash off things like telling people they don't need a mask when outside in PV. Alunelu my skin is thick, been on this forum for a long time. And after 32 years going to PV, I know people too. They're wearing masks, so I doubt our friends will be getting together lol."
"Kansas, thanks for the refreshing post!"
Yes Yaz that's it! She's a bully.
"Went to 5D in the morning, birria, juice etc stands packed (working class locals before work), no customers wearing masks. Navigating the crowded uneven sidewalks, maybe 10% wearing masks. I mostly walked the cobblestone streets to maintain distance. All the small hardware, grocery tiendas, etc have the signs to wear masks to enter but inside very few wear them. Busses full, standing shoulder to shoulder in aisles, half at best wearing masks."
#27 She also advocates to travel when infected with Covid.

"Please do not take the following as an endorsement of anything that Alunelu has posted ... But I do know the feelings of being attacked here on this forum, so I can at least empathizeCase in point : ... last year I had doubts as to whether the promised drinking water would be available and came on here to ask where the best spot to pick up a full Garrafon would be ... One of the first responses was from ""Funky"", where he informed all that he had warned me away from this place ... a host of problems, the only one that worried me was that drinking water would not be delivered as promised .... I'm not new to this area of Mexico, even have some friends in the area that not only checked out this place but gave me a contact of a friend of theirs that had recently stayted at that particular place After the post from Funky along came a host of so-called experts lambasting me for not heeding ""Funky""s"" warnings and some were down right nastyI came on the next day and set the record straight .... the verbal abuse stopped but not one of these people came back to apologize for jumping to a wrong conclusaion based on little evidenceNot one of these so called experts answered the question eitherI did not come back to call anyone names or belittle them ... not worth the effort ... The end result for me was that some who post here ceased to be credible in my eyes So even though I don't agree with Alunelu calling anyone a ""Karen"" or any other name, I do understand her frustration and refuse to condemn her publicly ... that's one reason to send a PM if it mattered to me that much, I guess"
"#24. So you watch a couple of webcams and know a few people and say that you know it’s not crowded and not necessary to wear a mask outside. I live here. Is it busy like high season, obviously not. But I dodge people daily on sidewalks and in the markets and elsewhere. There is lots of times where I can’t social distance outdoors so I wear a mask. Telling people not to is irresponsible. Plus it’s mandated here. I am not going to be one of these people that tell people not to come here. Lord knows we need it. And I think people can visit here safely by being smart. But if you do come, respect the mandates and respect the people of Vallarta and their rules while you are here."
I think Karen supports tRump. Enough said.
Extremely well said Lover of Mexico. So glad I know you. Never posts but when she does....... To whomever she is talking to.......You my friend Do Not Live Here . You probably Never will. Stay home.

"kevin and inge---i will be jealous every monday---broke my heart about june. it is mending slowly and i'm looking forward to when i can visit again---december or june---although december doesn't look promising.now for the mask subject. here's where i get ugly.i had to deal with the birdbrains whackin and hackin and getting me sick on the plane in the past until i started wearing masks so i could keep those ""only care about me peeps' and their rights"" germs out. I had to cancel 3 weeks in june, a week in bermuda, and a week in savannah this summer. I resigned from my job as a hpe teacher and cut our living salary in half. i know it's all about me---just telling my story.but if i have to lose my summer next year because of the pendejos who want to prolong this because they are beyond selfish........"
"38 - Iyam - it is not ugly at all. What is ugly are those who don’t give a damn about anyone else, and probably don’t have any loss of income. I wish they would go and colonize somewhere so the rest of us can get on with doing what we can to stop the spread. Yesterday’s news brings hope to the horizon."
