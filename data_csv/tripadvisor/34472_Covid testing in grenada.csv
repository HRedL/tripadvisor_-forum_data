What does the rapid test on arrival consist of and how long does it take?
i just been checking this out again as things seem to be changing but if you come from a low risk area then you wont need the PCR at the MBIA unless you are positive on the rapid
"HI there, has there been an update whether SAMS now provides PCR certified testing by now? Thank you!"
"For people leaving Grenada, I'm told they have to pay $150 US for the test. However they heard it would be no cost after tomorrow. Does anyone have any information about that? Or is there a site I can get the information from?"
"thats what i thought until i followed the link on the ministry of health web page, the advice changed and countries are no longer named but to qualify as low risk there has to be less than 20 infections in 100000 of the population and the uk is now 13.5 which puts us into the green low risk grade. Please have a look and advise if i'm wrong as i'm finding it very hard to get advice. thanks"
this is the link to the Grenada governments latest advice https://covid19.gov.gd/ on there you will find this further link to the data used to rank countries green yellow or red. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control - https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea could someone ccheck it out and let us know
"Could you direct me to the current list please as ive written to the ministry, the high commission in the uk and pure grenada, none reply except the commission who direct me to the web sites i've already checked. when i go i will take precautions as if coming from a medium risk country but as far as i can see the government is relying on the link on their web site. it would be really helpful to know there to find the list so that i can check every now and again so that i can book rooms. thanks"
sorry i wont bother you again
"Hi. I realise it's early days yet with Covid 19, and things can change overnight. As seen with UK wanting people returning from Aruba, Turks and Caicos, France and more needing to isolate for 14 days this week. My questions 1. You mention health form and downloading app. I found the form, but where is the app?2. At present UK tourists will have to take rapid test on arrival in Grenada, isolate for 2 days if negative at a prebooked, paid and approved accommodation - see puregrenada.com for list.Question, the hotel I looked at required a minimum of 3 days stay!What are you allowed to do in this quarantine accommodation?Purgrenada.Com is useful source of info, impossible to get replies from BA or the UK high commission."
"From what i can see there is no app yet. i too have booked 3 days at an hotel just to be on the safe side. we are hoping to travel on to Carriacou but cant get much advice on this. using the information that is supplied by the Grenada authorities, the UK is now low risk but do the Grenadian authorities see it that way. i'm afraid in the words of the song, there are more questions than answers"
"Have a listen to this press conference, it may shed some more light https:/…"
"Thanks Dennis, that's a great link.So if I understand it, countries that are low risk but still aren't actually acknowledged as low risk have to get a PCR test before coming, then get a rapid test, then get another PCR test and do a mandatory government stay. Then with 3 negative tests they will have to wear a tracking watch for the remainder of their quarantine. In understand cautious but for me that is excessive. I'd love to come if and when we get classified as low risk"
"Hi J_RYes confusing isn't it, here's what i plan to do; i am travelling back from the UK, when Grenada started to open its borders the UK was denoted as medium risk by the grenadian authorities, it then bought out further advice using the EU/Uk notification system which put the uk in the low risk category and using the same system the UK has now gone back to medium risk because the notification system says there are more than 20 cases per 100,000 so i am planning to book as if the UK will stay moderate risk. I have booked my flight and i have also booked an approved hotel for 3 days (the quarantine for medium countries is i believe 10 days, I will get a PCR test a few days before i leave and if this is clear i will travel and on arrival at the airport they will do a temperature test and another PCR within 48 hours, i have applied for home quarantine so if the PCR test is negative i will travel up to carriacou where i will complete the rest of the 10 days quarantine. I have written this out because it is how i understand things. here is the link to the current advice, keep checking as its apt to change https:/…Entering_Grenada.pdf also remember to fill in the forms at https:/…all the best"
"do you have any more info on this geofencing watch as i cant find any info, is it bought or rented is it fixed on like a criminals tag, will someone come to carriacou to remove it, also i refer to quarantine as that is what the application for ""home Quarantine"" refers to which is different to the ""limited movement"" that you refer to which is for those going to an approved facility I, hopefully will be going to my own empty home if they allow me to.all the best"
"It's all a bit confusing. There was a post on here that suggested a 10 day quarantine period, and in the video link above the guy from Grenada MOH said so as well.However, there's no website/flow chart to confirm that. MOH entry requirements still shows 48 hours if negative, in approved accommodation for UK arrivals. We are suppose to be coming for a 10 day holiday in December - which will be a complete waste of time if it's 10 days in quarantine ( although the location may be super though!)The only hope is if the UK becomes a low risk? Otherwise it only leaves the Cancellation option..Edited: 10:56 am, August 20, 2020 "
"if i read it right you will be able to come if the uk is medium risk and if you pass the tests you will be allowed limited movement, it may be a good idea to drop an email to the hotel you fancy an as long as its on the list they may be able to tell you what limited movement means then you will be able to make an informed choice."
"as Jimmy Cliff said ""the more i find out, the less i know"""
"Thanks for all the info Bob and Dennis. I realise Grenada is a small island which appealed to us when booking our holiday, and I understand the need to avoid any outbreaks of covid 19.However, having said that this doesn't look like a relaxing holiday! But a total waste of money, plus covid test expenses and wrist security geofencing device expenses. Also having police on quarantine accommodation!! I am leaning towards postponement or cancelling altogether. This will be very disappointing because it was suppose to celebrate a special birthday.Unless things change, unfortunately I can't see that happening in a positive way.Edited: 5:22 am, August 21, 2020 "
"Yes i understand where you are coming from, hopefully we will see you there another time. stay safe"

"Thats great news about Canada, Bob!Thanks so much for all the helpful information you post here."
"Thanks Bob What you are saying is as much as i suspected i e its down to the usual unwritten rules. anyway we will do all the right things, tests , forms, hotels , permissions etc and hope for the best and if nothing changes here in the uk the worst that can happen is 10 days at True Blue and then on to carriacou and having stayed there a good few times, no hardship.many thanks"
