"Hi,I am tempted by cheap rates on this hotel which I think will open on the 1st March.There aren´t really much details on the web, does anyone have any insights?Ideally we are looking for a hotel with easy access to restaurants/street food in the evening. Would this location be ok?Also, what daytime activiities will be in the area if we get bored of lazing by the pool?ThanksSarah"
"I am glad you posted Sarah, just checked out the website and it looks promising. Do you know whereabouts exactly it is? We were going to stay at the Melati in Chong Mon but it's a tad out of the way. Akaryn would be perfect if it were in walking distance to the main area of Chong Mon!Keep us updated if you do stay there, I would love to see some traveller pics."
"Stephfennel,I don´t know its exactly location but I have emailed the hotel for further details and also asked for some more pictures. I will let you know when they respond.I don´t really know much about Chong Mon, I found this hotel by chance when using the ´Small Luxury Hotels of the World´website as we have stayed at hotels on that website before and have always been impressed. Hence I have been focused on finding the right hotel as opposed to the location.Is Chong Mon good for local thai restaurants? We are looking for some night life, but nothing too loud and crazy'?Thanks"
"I have not been to Samui yet but from what I have been told it seems to be a great area. A fair range of local restaurants, massages etc, and one of the better beaches on the island (nice sand). Do a quick forum search on Chong Mon to see what opinions come up. We are not going until June/July so would love to see the reviews when they start coming in as you can never tell from the websites."
"Dear Stephanie and Sarah,Warmest greetings from Akaryn Resort and Spa Koh Samui. Thank you for the above questions.Please let me introduce myself as Paul Counihan, Director of Sales and Marketing for AHMS Hotels. If you wish to recieve any further information or If I can assist in anyway please do not hesitate to contact me personally at paul@ahmshotels.comFor maps / directions / what to do just send me a question email and happy to assist with dialogue and send you information that is up to date at all times.Best regards from SamuiPaul"
"Hi Were travelling to Koh Samui next month, and have been trying to find a nice hotel. I have just check out the web site for the Akaryn Resort and Spa Koh Samui and it does look very nice. I think it’s a definite possibility that we will be booking to staying there. I will post on our return to let you know what it was likeCheers h"
Enjoy your trip Hells10. Looking forward to seeing your reviews on it!
"We usually stay at Poppies or the Centara but would also be interested on any info for this hotel, especially the location."
"Looks good! I've got a reservation elsewhere for June but I'm thinking of changing to here.I recently read a magazing article and Kelly Rowland was saying that the sister property on Phuket, The Aleenta, was amazing!! If it's good enough for an international superstar, it's good enough for me!!!"
"Hi Paul, not entirely sure why youdidn't answer the location question that people seem to be interested in. Surely answering it here rather then requesting people email you individually, would benefit the TA community and your resort (unless the location is a secret?)From what I can tell, it looks like this property is located at Hanuman bay which is between Choeng Mon Beach (to the north) and Chaweng Beach (to the south). I'm guessing this property is somewhat isolated and that guests would likely need motorised transport in order to enjoy a greater variety of outside restaurants, bars and activities but I could be wrong.Perhaps Paul can confirm for everyone's benefit?Cheers.Edited: 8 years ago "
I got emailed a map from Paul. The map isn't very detailed but it appears to be the beach I've marked on the google map below:maps.google.co.uk/maps…It does look rather remote - not really with walking distance of anywhere - the main road is over 500m from the resort.I'd be interetsted to see the bar/restaurant menus and the prices.
"Judging from the map you'd be very dependent on your own/resort transport to go anywhere.Granted the resort looks good, no doubt fully self contained and expensive, as hotel service prices on Samui invariably are, and if you like a 1 location break, a good choice but a good location for shopping, nightlife etc, it isn't."
"Ahh thanks, that location explains why I couldn't find the hotel despite searching for 3 days.That location isn't in the middle of nowhere, but there is next to nothing within walking distance. You either get your own transport or you walk up to the main road and try to catch a Songthaew to Chaweng. Which is a 10 minute drive down the road."
"Firstly, thanks for highlighting this new hotel to me. After reading this thread I had a look and today booked a stay there for April. I admit I was very much attracted by the promo rates! :-). Having said that boutique hotel is what we are looking for and all my contact with the hotel re questions have been answered promptly and thoroughly. We are only staying 3 nights so not investing our whole holiday in an unknown property. Quite looking forward to it now!Thanks again."
"Dear All,Many thanks for all of your emails to me and we are delighted to assist.To assist guests fully understand where the location is we added an Aerial Photo of the resort and the area to our website as well as a map and more details timings how long it takes to reach other destinations on the island.Please visit the following link http://www.akaryn.com/location/We have also confirmed we shall be offering a shuttle to Chaweng 3 x times each day in the morning, afternoon, sunset time and late evening for guests who want to shop and dine outside and give guests more freedom to explore. We have set a small charge of THB 75 per person for this service. We looked at what other resorts are charging and this is very competitive indeed when you consider other resorts charges as well as the taxi fairs on the island. Please if you have any other questions no matter how small please let me know on paul@ahmshotels.comThank you and wish you all a pleasant week and hopefully see you in Samui soon.Best regardsPaul"
HiEither this hotel is fully booked thoughout March or they have delayed the opening as I cannot make a booking until 25th March. With is a shame as it does look very nice.
Well done Paul and all the best with the opening.I think the Akaryn would make an excellent retreat for those looking to escape the crowds. I will certainly consider spending a few nights at this resort on my next Samui vacation. Looking forward to reading the first lot of reviews.Cheers.
hells10 - maybe there is a glitch with their online booking? I put the dates in on their website and it came back with availability from the 16th March?! Not sure what is going on there?Steph
"Hi AllIf the level of service at this Hotel is as high quality as their customer service before even booking, then you will be very impressed with a stay here. Due to the corresponds from Paul, I’m in the process of changing my travel itinerary to include a stay at this Hotel.I will look forward to posting a very pleasing report on our return.H"
"Hi ,Any TA localite in Samui who can get us a good feedback ? Maybe post a few photos too ? regds"
Hi We are planning to travel to samui in early april and are thinking of staying here. A friend of mine stayed at their sister property Aleenta in Phuket and said that it was absolutely fabulous. Hope this is as good.
"Should be open now! has any one been?  I only want to hear the fabulous stories! Not the disasters! We will be staying there in a months time, So hoping all the opening gitters are bedded down by thenCheers"
"hi all not heard about anyone staying there as yet, we get there on the 23rd march. I will post on how wonderful it is, anything you want to know ie food/drink prices just ask away. they have wfi so I should able to answer any questions once we get there! only 8 days till we leave chilly and wet UK for Bangkok! happy holibobs to everyone h"
"Hi ozmouse ,hells10,We are also going to be there by end of April.. /early May ..Hope to hear from you guys since u are gonna be there early ... If they manage the hotel like they did with my bookings and queries then it's gonna be superb all the way..looking forward to some of the local TA members going there and posting some reviews and pics.regdsHarri"
"Ok... confirmed... 3 rooms booked in next 2 months! As stated earlier, I booked after hearing about this place on the boards, and after my email correspondence for booking. I agree hari, i can only hope the attention my bookings/queries attracted extend to my stay and all will be fine. We leave end of march for BKK and are spending a week in Samui at a private villa with friends. We then move to Akaryn for only 3 days at the end of the holiday. So we are not really gambling with a whole holiday, and are willing to take the chance on some great rates for an ocean front villa. The other resort in Phuket is a well run property, so have no problem commting ourselves here. I had issues with the pictures provided on webpage not showing any shade/umbrellas on villa decks. I am assured it can be /not be an issue/arranged. Hells is the first guinea pig, and i will report in on the ground while im there. Do you think it can be that bad in paradise??"
"Looks really nice from the pics and the staff member who emailed me really was helpful however I am turned off by the fact that only their best rooms have a bath in it!! I am not willing to spend an extra $60 per night AUD for a bath (granted they are much bigger rooms)I know I know, I sound crazy. It has a pool but having a bath is on my favorite things to do on holidays and for that reason I have chosen against it. Such a shame really as I think it's going to be fabulous.I am still suprised that they would build a brand spankin new resort and not put bathtubs in the bathrooms. Seems like a strange corner to cut really. Wouldn't have cost them much. I really can't stand a bathroom with bath :("
I emailed them on Sunday and yesterday but have yet to get a response. Hmmm I thought that they reply pretty quickly. How quickly do they reply?I wonder if they have opened. Can't seem to find much info on that. Suppose to open on the 1st of March. Anyone know if they provide complimentary water sports - kayak and stuff?
Maybe not everyone cares about laying in a bath on vacation? I'm sure they would have put them in all the rooms if there was actually a demand.
"Great! They have replied my email. Aparently, they are not offically opened. Hmm. The official date is 26 March 2012. Hmmm But Hells10 reservation is for 23 March. I guess thats the soft opening? Steph - The photos that they had sent to me has a free standing bathtub in the room. Looks pretty good. That's the photo for the pool villas. I am not sure if the pool suites has a bathtub though.However, the pool villas seem to not have a seaview.They mentioned that they have sea kayaks and a house reef."
now I'm concerned! I don't mind solitude or no bath but I'm not sure about staying in an unopened hotel! I think another email to confirm if there open or not is in order as the 26th is 3 days after we suppose to arrive! I do hope this is wrong as we leave in a few days and I thought everything was planned and organised!
"fresh-prince - well that's pretty obvious, if we all wanted the same thing out of a holiday all resorts would be identical hey?Rooms without bathtubs are pretty rare in 5 star resorts, I am still not convinced it's due to a perceived lack of demand"
"Ettius you are right, the pool villas are right at the back of the resort in the gardens. Another strange move, I would have thought that they would have put their most expensive rooms closer to the ocean.If you go to the location page, there is a resort map on it (I think that's where they are).I am not by any means trying to bag this place out, it does look stunning, just making a few observations that in my mind seem odd."
"Hells10,Dont be too stress out. They must be operational to take your business. Maybe they gave me the wrong dates. Hmm. Let me know if they reply you.Steph - I wonder why they put their pool villas behind as well. Maybe it is on a little hill? We will have to wait for someone to go to find out why. The resort does look beautiful though, My friend has been to Aleenta at phuket and she told me that it is really nice. So.... I am hoping that this turn out well!"
"Again a immediate response from the Akaryn! Yahoo full steam ahead for our holiday.Thank you for your email.We have to inform you that we are planning to do soft opening during that period which operation side will be running but not 100% completely yet. However, our guests can enjoy the experience with no effect on their stay in any way.For any enquires or anything else we can do for you, please do not hesitate to let me know. Best Regards,Beau"
"Hells,... Find out what's going on! They should keep you informed... And I'm sure they will. Isn't the sales mgr following this thread? he can jump in and pass on some news and pics!! :-)As for the bathtub debate.... Does not bother me in the least, but I understand other peoples min requirements for a holiday! For me direct access to the beach is a big priority for me. And I think dinky little plunge pools a waste of space. So while I love the look of the villa large pools, we are staying in a beachfront suite with plunge pool. That is why we booked.What I find weird is this modern trend of hotel bathrooms with glass walls, no walls, and in the case of akayrn, bathtubs in the middle of the bedroom? Don't understand that. To create that luxury and not wrap it in a cone of privacy and solitude does not make sense to me. ( unless that is not what you are using the bath for Steph!? Wink wink....)21 days till we are in bkk!"
"I'm looking forward to your review hells10!If you give the resort a good review, I may cancel my reservation elsewhere and book here :) I'm really interested in the prices of food and drink in the resort. A private beach BBQ is 2500 per person!"
"ozmouse you are a cheeky one ;) I honestly don't mind the open bathrooms, I am very comfortable with hubby but I do understand that some people are shy.We are staying at the Hansar too and their bathtubs are in the centre of the room too. I love the idea :)"
portex where is the beach bbq for 2500 that sounds quite expense for a burger on the beach!!! hoping our stay goes well! we only booked for 3 nights with the option of staying for 12 nights if we like it! hoping to give good reports back! roll on next week! I'm like a little kid waiting for Christmas!
"Don't understand PortexIts a new resort and everything will be pristine and clean, the service ought to be immaculate, and Hells10 has already part reviewed""I will post on how wonderful it is"" and it really must be!So if you want to be treated like a VIP, nows the time to book.Heaven help the resort if it recieves any bad reviews on/shortly after opening!"
I emailed asking for the restaurant menus and all they sent me was the menu for a private BBQ on the beach. It's a bit fancier than just a burger but still pretty expensive!!If the resort is as good as the sister properties then it must be pretty good!!
"HI Hells, I am looking forward to seeing the pics you post. All the best."

"Ozmouse ,I agree with your views on totally on opening out the rooms/bathrooms and then trying to wrap a air of solitude/privacy .. My concern was more on the plunge pool looking quite open in the pics on the website ..a plunge pool is a good place to skin dip and also maybe some ""wink wink"" ..And if you are gonna let that be open to all for people walking by then ,it is just loses that touch..or one has to be a sorta flasher type which I am not and .. whomsoever takes the pics pls send some snaps of the plunge pool from all angles ..regdsHarri"
"will do harri I'lll be on my way this time next week! so I promise loads of photos of the pools will be taken! hopefully not of people doing ""wink wink"" in them!!! cheers h"
Thanks hells10 and wish you a very wonderful and peaceful holiday..
"DOH! good point harri! i think your right... not much privacy on the decks of the suites. Plus the disadvantage of not having mature landscaping around the property. Ok lets hope we are the only ones there... because im going to be getting my kit off for my 'private' pool! Im on holidays! And best wishes to hells for a great holiday! hope the weather is hot, the beer cold and the food cheap! cheers"
"Hello, I had reservations with this hotel made well in advance for their grand opening dates which was scheduled for March 1, 2012. Just ONE day before our departure (and only 15 days before their Grand Opening), we receive an email from the hotel manager stating that they won't be opening their hotel on the scheduled date after all. They offered to help find a replacement hotel, and went on and on about the ""connections"" they'll use to accommodate us elsewhere. Yet - we never heard back from them in regard to this. My husband and I had to scram in Koh Samui for accommodations. Thank God we found some good ones. The other issue I had with them was in regard to the lack of information they offer via their website. They have very little *actual* pictures (not ""theoretical pics) of their rooms and little to no information on the rooms themselves. When we reserved their room, we opted for their largest and priciest accommodation which was their Pool Villa. We figured this would offer the best amenities. Later, and after many emails sent, we finally get a response to inform us that these Villas are ""stand-alone"" but do not offer any Sea Views. The only rooms to do so are the Pool Sea Views (or whatever they're called) which we thought was bizarre. Why place your priciest and largest accommodation without ocean views is beyond me! They promise to email you everything, and all, and they make it sound all nice and pretty. While it does look promising, I would simply recommend that you don't set your expectations too high. Still, we would've liked to have ""opened up"" a new hotel. To this day, we have not received a response to our previous email. Similarly, I do think they should offer some sort of future discount to those of us whose accommodations were cancelled. As far as Koh Samui - the beaches are very nice, but also very crowded. I just returned yesterday, and I'm glad that we decided to spend only 3 nights in Koh Samui and the rest of our vacation in quieter islands."
"The fact that you want to ""wink-wink"" in the pool is just repulsive. Keep it in while outside 4 walls, is a motto I think we could all benefit from. One of the things I absolutely HATED while in Thailand these past few weeks were all those women who thought it was completely appropriate to bathe topless. At public beaches, and at public facilities at the hotels, like the hotel pools. Ladies - if you're not at a topless/nude facility - keep your damn top on. NO ONE wants to see your saggy boobs. NO ONE, except for you (apparently), wants to see your beautiful boobs. Have some respect - if not for yourself, for OTHERS who are ALSO paying for the hotel amenities you are so abrasive on being topless at. I appreciate you wanting to keep your ""wink-wink"" discreet. But I would ask that if the pools are not discreet, that you think twice for the courtesy of others."
"Oh my my ..I believe lupitandre had a long haul flight back to LA ..and maybe back to the hustle and bustle of LA after a island trip is enough to make one all the more grumpy...dont worry Lupitandre ..we will all be very neat and proper and make sure that our GF's wear full cover swimsuit jumpers and we will act and behave and be prim and proper like the STEPFORD community ( remember the movie )..As they say "" One man's food is another man's poison ""..Ozmouse ,hells10 ..seems the damn recession has taken a toll on people's thinking in good ole star's and stripes country.. In times square in New york there is a guy who parades around in a cowboy hat and a underwear only and he is a local attraction ..Talk of The Pot calling the Kettle Black...regdsHarri"
harriI can't wait to be in my underpants and cowboy hat! wishing everyone happy holidays and lots of wink wink! cheers h!
"Don't know where Lupitandre has been staying but in all the years I've been to KS I've seen little of the 'bare flesh fraternity' in any public places. Of course there's been the odd visitor who chooses to ignore locals and (I believe) the law.Methinks she won't return, her loss."
I am now very worried! all emails to and from this hotel has been thought my work computer! as were leaving for Bangkok in a couple of days if they email me to say there not open I will not get the message! help with somewhere else to stay just in case is needed! poop poop and more poop! hotel in Bangkok I booked has been burnt down! wings are cracking on the A380! and the hotel in koh samui ain't open! and there was I thinking in 48hrs i'd be having a bit of wink wink! whilst wondering around in me pants and cow boy hat! cheers h
"I am sure thinks will be fine when you get there hells10. There are plenty more hotels in Bangkok and I am sure Akaryn will be ready and waiting for you.As for the cracks on the A380, you might want to pack a roll of duct tape ;)"
"Mansfiled topc,I completely agree..Have been all across phuket,krabi and even forgettable places like pattaya ..have seen most of the tourists adhering to a dress code which is like any other beach locations across the world..Hells10, Akaryn has posted some nice pictures on their facebook site enough to make me drool and think of going commando ...seems to be real secluded location from what one of my friends told me ..He believes what they say is right ..It's close like 5-7 minutes to chaweng by road yet sortoff cutoff..Stephfennel, Believe u are going there in June ..Am sure it will be real fine then..I believe this hotel chain group is quite good ..their top honcho, one lady, is a director in 'the small luxury hotels of the world'..see the link below traveltrends.biz/ttn555-anchalika-kijkanakor…Harri"
I was walking on Chaweng last week and it was boob central. Particularly in the north. A real epidemic. I think one person does it and the lemmings follow. Wish they wouldn't. Am driving past today - will see if I can spot the Akaryn for you and suss if open.Edited: 8 years ago 
"Harrikris, yep we are off to KS for 12 nights in June/July but we ended up deciding not to stay at the Akaryn, as it was just a bit over our preferred budget for this trip. We are staying at the Melati for 6 nights and the Hansar for 6 nights, before popping over to the Shangri la in Bangkok for 3 nights. So can't wait!!"
fleetcatdid you suss out the Akaryn? hope your having a great time cheers h
Wasn't obvious from the road. Will need to read the website and get some directions!
thanks for trying to find it fleetcatlet us know if you have any luck?cheers and have a wonderful time h
"Back to the drawing board!Akaryn have just cancelled our reservation, due to a delay in opening!Opening date is now 26th March"
Oh no hells10!! You are really not having any luck are you?!What are you plans now? Any alternative ideas? What about the Tongsai?
"Dear All,Thank you for all of your posts. I have returned back from an overseas visit to Europe to the resort this morning and met with our contractors who are completing the public areas of the resort. It is with great sadness that we are delaying our grand opening until 26 March 2012. We could open but we are not satisfied that the public areas are completed to a standard where our guests will not be inconvenienced in anyway. This is not a financial decision but we have taken it to protect our long term reputation on the island and in Thailand. I am going to personally assist Hell10 for the time she was due to stay with us to ensure she is well looked after on the island. Hopefully she will be able to come and visit us from the 26 March with our compliments also as a further gesture of goodwill.We did have a photoshoot of our main Pools and completed Pool Villas last week and they are now on our site. Please do not hesitate to contact me at paul@ahmshotels.com if I can be of any further help or answer any more questions.Kindest regards to allPaul"
"I have never in all the years of travelling had such amazing customer service as I have had dealing with this hotel.Outstanding service from the start, with continues updates into where we stand.Looking forward to our later than planned stay at the New Akaryn on the 26th March.Paul my sincere thanks for everything you have done to help us."
This won't be much help but I found the hotel today. It is down a single lane opposite the 7/11 on the road between Choeng Mon and Chaweng for anybody here wanting to have a peek. There were so many cars that I couldn't stop to have a proper look as I was in a hurry and there was literally no parking. The entrance - which is all I saw - is still a complete building site and the land to the rear is still very much a work in progress. However I've seen this before and it is amazing how quickly things come together. I'm off on holiday tomorrow so won't be able to get back before it opens. Looking forward to testing the restaurant (s?) on my return.
"Well did'nt you guys get up to lots of news over the weekend while i was looking the other way! Hells... Interesting to hear your response with regards to hotel not being open. Great to hear they are looking after to you, and satisfied with the outcome.And lots of hotels in BKK to choose from, so that should not be an issue as well. Might be able to take advantage of last minute rates at this stage! As for the A380... Good luck! i have never been on one due to exploding engine on qantas last year. Good old work horse of the skies 747 for us again this year.cheers"
"Finally 24hrs before we leave for Bangkok all accommodation is now sorted, with loads of help from the Akaryn. Steph the Akaryn were fantastic, were staying in the sister hotel for 3 nights and then moving to the Akaryn for their opening.Fleetcat Thank you for going to take a look for us, I have seen how quick they turn what looks like a building into a little palace.Ozmouse thanks for reminding me about the engine blowing up (lol) forgot about that one. Happy Hoilbobs to everyone"
"Great news! Looking forward to hearing your reviews and perhaps a few pics on our return.Have a fabulous trip. I am more than a little jealous, I still have 16 weeks to go"
"hells10,really great to hear about the wonderful service you got from Akaryn..I've interacted with paul also while booking and found him to be really helpful and to the point ..And it is this sort of customer service which builts itself into a hotel's image .. All the best for the opening Paul...and have a super duper holiday and give us the complete info hells10..."
"I actually love being from LA, and for your info - there are some very nice quaint areas around me. Not everything is ""hustle and bustle"" as portrayed in the films. Although if I want that, I can have it too. If you haven't toured or visited the area, or California in general- perhaps you should leave those obvious stereotypes to yourself. I was simply expressing an opinion, which I believe I'm entitled to do so - just like you just publicly shared you wanted to have intercourse in a deck pool - I publicly shared for you to be courteous of others if it wasn't so private. I believe I am entitled to that opinion, just as you were entitled to yours. In no way does that make me ""grumpy"", in the same way that wanting to have intercourse in a pool that may or may not fully private makes you ""filthy"". However - I chose to refrain from criticizing you. I simply made a kind request. You, on the other hand - not only chose to make assumptions as to the type of person that I am, but also criticized me for being from where I'm from which is just childish. I love my city, and I love my country. Leave it alone - don't go there. I'm not Timesquare Cowboy's mother, nor is he related to me. I'm also not from New York. Am I to criticize you based on strangers that are making fools of themselves in your country? I never asked for you to keep your GF in a ""jumper"". And stating so was again - childish. You could've taken my opinion the same I took yours, commented on it in a DECENT way and moved on. But no - you attacked a complete stranger - and why? Oh, yes, because she asked for some courtesy from others in a land where public nudity is illegal. Why that petition brought across your childish criticism on my persona, my country, and city is completely beyond me.Edited: 8 years ago "
The response above was for Harrikris . I apologize for any confusion this may have caused to others.
I'm 100% sure this thread was started and been covered over a new hotel opening! which has been a great help to people that are going there or planning to go there! people on this thread have had a right giggle over the last few weeks regarding wink wink and cow boy hats!!! there is no need to join into the tread if a bit of humor offends you! happy hollibobs
"The response below is for Lupitandre. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused to others .One point which I have seen in the TA forums irrespective of country, religion is the liberal dose of humour which is the one thing which keeps it going . It is evident in this thread also if you read it through ..it started from ozmouse on the 'bath' thought which Stephnell to her credit never found it offensive and then we all took that up ..Somewhere in between you stepped in and took on me with a sprinkling of words like ""repulsive "" ..and then addressing ladies at large with words like 'saggy boobs'. worse is the fact that you used capital words which is equivalent to shouting in mail etiquette.. And after all this you mention in your current mail that you made a kind request . worse you follow it up with again calling me 'filthy' ..And as far as you calling me childish..thank you ...there is a bit of a child in all of us ..but in this world of hate and anger ,please please do not try and deprive us of some bit of humor and fun..In TA there is no country or religion or politics , there is only this fanatical ""Love for Travel"" which binds us all.. If you don't like it ,please do not come to this thread ..Nobody steps out of line in TA forums as there are very clear rules and offensive posts are taken off promptly by moderators . leave us to our fun and games and playful potshots at each other ..have a nice day ..regdsHarri"
Just organised our stay at Akaryn for late September for our family to celebrate some major milestones. Just waiting on confirmation back. So far my dealings with reservation staff has been great. Working for one of the largest serviced apartment groups in Australia it is very impressive to receive such a high level of service. It instils fantastic expectations for our stay ahead.Can't wait to report on Akaryn after our stay. I'm sure it is going to be amazing.
stef i'll be able to let you know how great it is in a couple of days! after the madness of Bangkok and pattaya can't wait for bit of relax!
Cant wait to read your review. Enjoy
just arrived at samui! to stay at the sister resort as Akaryn not open till 26th! not sure if I'm very impressed with our room! going to reception in the morning to see if we can up grade! not sure if we just been spoilt by the previous hotels we stayed in or I'm being fussy! :(
That's not good! I thought they'd have given you at least a two category upgrade for the inconvenience!!I've went ahead and booked Sala Samui instead of Akaryn. Akayrn is too much of an unknown to justify spending £125 a night on it! Sala was only £96 a night!
portex it is really nice but not what we were hoping for! we have stayed in some fantastic hotels in the last few days so I'm probably just expecting to much! we just left a huge suite into a match box! for more money! I can't unpack as there's nowhere to put anything :( I think a move is on the cards! on a lighter note I'm sat outside listening to the waves with a cold beer at 2.30 am and its really hot! cheers h
Can I ask where are you staying now hells10? Always good to get feedback on a place.
stephwere in akyra chura samui until the Akaryn opens! its in a great location and really nice place. I think I just got used to having loads of space and its really tiny in the room. I'm just being to fussy! cheers h
hi guysWe just packed up to go to Akaryn! only to unpack again :( still not ready! spoken to Paul and he's again been great! I will look forward to the first reviews from the first guests when it finally opens :)
"OH OH!! From what i remember... im the next cab off the rank here. We are not going to be there till April 8th though, so should be enough time....BUT that is easter weekend, so i suspect that will be a busy weekend/week for hoteliers with incoming visitors, so do not want to contemplate finding accom then (not to mention songkran following weekend). hmmmm.... what to do...."
"hells10 - you must be very kind hearted, I know many who would by now be more than a little upset :) or perhaps even fuming ""We just packed up to go to Akaryn! only to unpack again :( still not ready""This can't be making your holiday that much fun can it.......(?)"
"Oh no, that's terrible. Hope you are getting that upgrade at your current resort! Fingers crossed that it all works out ok."
"What a bummer hells10 - at least they are looking after you i hope. Have you had a chance to even see the resort? Maybe you should inform them, time permitting, that you would still like to see the resort. They may be able to organise a tour for you to have a bit of a look around.Ozmouse - Hopefullt there won't be any further delays and it will be open for your intended stay.Our booking is still 6 months off so I assume that it should definately be open by then."
ozmouseI really wouldn't worry if they cannot take you in they will not see you on the streets! so no need to bring a tent! Paul has sorted us out with somewhere else to stay free of charge :) so all good! I'll have to wait a whole 12 months before I can't see how nice it is! but looking forward to others guests reviews in the mean time! cheers h
"hells10, admire your cheerful attitude and Paul should really give you a real round of freebies..and I believe paul would cause I have also found Paul to be quite nice .. Waiting to hear ur first posts coming in...Ozmouse ..I dont think u need to worry cause these hotel chaps are something when it comes to changing the look and services overnight.had the occassion to see a hotel once 2 weeks before opening and I cancelled the booking..Post 2 week's thought I'd pay a visit to see the hotel and maybe pride myself on my good sense ..Got a shock when i saw the place all decked up and fine and other guests raving ..Seems they gave a free happy hour and food for the first full week ..U can imagine my agony..regdsHarri"
Monicaits too nice here and I'm enjoying myself too much to get upset about a hic up! :)!steph still in little room they want £44 to upgrade and as were out most of the time it seemed silly to pay extra! I am in paradise :) hope everyone's hollibob's is a great as ours has been so farcheers h
So very glad to hear you are still having a wonderful holiday and you haven;t let all these dramas ruin it.I am super jealous! 13 weeks until we get there. So can't wait!!
stephwe started our holiday in Bangkok where we were upgraded the 7 roomed royal suites! then in pattaya hotel double booked us so ended up in a huge private condo on the beach! suns out the beers cold and the sea's warm! so having a great time! cheers h
"Contacted hotel for an update.... Response below. We proceeding as Neal. Will be nice end to our holiday. Leave in 36 hours for BKK!!!!""Please allow me to confirm that all of the resort is operating 100% from the 2nd April 2012. We have guests in house at the moment as part of our soft opening until 1st April while we test all of our operations teams and equipment which is very exciting! This is our 4th resort opening and our very first 5 star on Koh Samui and the resort is stunning.""Cheers"
ozmousetake loads of photos for us please! have a great time cheers h
"Interesting that they say they have guests in house at present as part of their ""soft opening"". If this is the case why is Hells10 not there? Why send them to Akryn instead?Hopefully all is in place for your reservation.Enjoy your holiday. Can't wait for the reviews to start rolling in"
"hi peepsWe were supposed to be leaving samui today, due to a my partner coming down with an illness it looks like we will be staying here longer than we planned too! I will try and find the Akaryn tomorrow and have a snoop around to see what's it like! cheers h"
"hells 10 ,that's so nice of you ..."
Bad form to send an email to a guest saying there are guests in house yet hells10 is not? Are they lying?! Does not look good for them when it comes out on TA. I wonder if Paul will chime in to explain this?
Hi GuysWe were to be there on 6th April but we have cancelled our trip as hells10 has not got his room. We dont want any such surprises so have started booking elsewhere. This is not good for a hotel to start taking reservations and then delay like this. I am highly dissappointed about this. After all you dont expect this from a SLH hotel.
ckbhai sorry to hear that you have had to change your travel plans because of our little bit of bad luck! I'm sure that they would have looked after you if they weren't ready in time for your visit! were still in samui at mo due to my partner being to poorly to fly so were staying in a shed down the road due to extra flight costs till next week! lol have a look at the amari palm reef! I had a noses about in there today and its lovely! ps peeps never found Akaryn but will have another go tomorrow! cheers h
SLH.com now says that bookings are not being taken for stays before 15 April
I know they have been advertising to get people from the triathalon to stay there so I assume they will definately open by then. It is on aroung 23rd or 25th April.
I've booked with slh a month ago for April 18. is it possible that wouldn't accept my order.?
"I too have booked via Agoda.com for the 18th - 27th and have not heard that it has been cancelled. Payment has been taken also, so happy to report back when we get there.This is a special holiday for us, so i really do hope everything is going to planMatt"
"hi matdon't want to worry you, but we were checking out of another hotel to move to Akaryn when I was told that it wasn't open! this is after numerous emails from the hotel to say that it was open and ready for us! I did try and find it when we were on koh samui but had no luck! I would do what I wish I would have done and checked out an alternative place to stay just in case! cheers h and have a great time"
"Hi Hells10,Thanks for that, i will certainly take a look.The money has been taken from my account by agoda, and usually this is once the hotel has confirmed the booking.I've emailed them directly on their site, so hopefully i will get some clarification as to what the situation is.Certainly not a good start!!Kind Regards, Matt"
"Dear All,Good morning from AKARYN Resort and Spa.Sorry if I have been a bit quiet of late! We did welcome guests from the 26 March. The guests inhouse from the 26 March - 01 April were guests I had talked to at length and we limited this to 6 rooms per night. We did open on the 02 April. Currently we have 24 Residences occupied this evening with 47 guests in total. We are completing 8 of our Pool Villas to the rear of the resort that is having minimal effects on guests enjoyment. Pleased to confirm the reason we are open for sale from the 14 April is that we have a large group in house from the 11- 14 April and we are 100% fully booked. Our first real test as a new hotel but promises to be good fun! I had good correspondance with HELLS10 for the past few weeks and I took the decision to allow her to stay on at our sister property The Akyra Chura Samui for and additonal 2 nights with our compliments as she has been so understanding. Needless to say I do regret not inviting her for a glass of fizz down at our beach while she was here so I could have used her to do some online Public Relations for me certainly on this Trip Advisor!! The offer certainly stands for your next visit HELLS10 and please stay in touch! If I can assist in any further way please contact me at paul@ahmshotels.com and I am happy to help! Best regards to allPaul CounihanDirector of Sales and Marketing AKARYN Resort and Spa / AHMS Hotels Thailand"

"Good morning folks! Reporting in from the akayrn room 122Arrived yesterday, after 5 night stay in private villa with larger group. Parked here now for 3 days rest before returning to BKK for songkran. Where does one start...Pics here. Hope this works for everyone http://tinyurl.com/72qryrxApologies for quantity over quality, but I'm on holidays, and it is easier for me to snap and dump with out editing and tagging without taking so much time.Basically, hotel is operational but still being completed. At the back of the resort where reception is, alot of work still being completed on villas. As you progress thru the property to beach front, it is completely landscaped and construction completed!We are in sea view room, second row from beach, and can not hear any construction noise.Our room is beautifully furnished with all luxury mod cons. Combo of luxury silk with polished concrete. Above average amenities like soaps lotions towels glassware, slippers, sandals, eye masks, pyjamas, robes, yoga mats, umbrellas. Quirky things like no bottle opener, 3 varieties of tea, but only 1 bag each/ no milk, phone not programmed for one touch dialling all can be improved. tv mounted on wall obscured by bed post is interesting. Might say lack of storage has been noted. Cubboard not long enough to hang pants without folding. But not everything is operational:3 story building in pics is spa and is not complete. Scheduled completion we were told was today. Not gonna happen. Reduced spa treatments menu (massage and pedicures) being offered in one of the suites.Yesterday was first day for restaurant lunch menu at the edge restaurant. All day dining. Only restaurant open. Thai food only at night. Not sure when other restaurants are opening. Have eaten lunch, dinner, and breakfast. Few issues at lunch, but overall food is excellent and not outrageously priced for resort. Gym only 2 pieces of equipment in atm, No air con.Newspapers not avail today. Cooking classes not available till next week.But let's not paint poor picture here. It is definately a project successfully moving forward. Staff are bending over backwards to accommodate requests. Some requests due to start up issues, or training issues with new staff. We have direct access to Diego, F&B mgr and Isobel, guest services manager, for any issues or requests. So that is all for now. Will post further room pics etc later. Beach is calling"
Hi OzmouseGlad to read your update and thanks for taken the time out of your holiday to post. We don't arrive at Akaryn until September so hopefully all will be operational then. Hope you are enjoying your time on the beach
"Thanks ozmouse Glad to here your having a good time and only some minor issues, I must admit now I've seen your photo's I'm even more gutted we never made it there! 354 days and counting, have a fabulous trip cheers h"
thanks ozmouse ...lovely photos ..I think covers most of the questions all of us asked ..thanks a ton for taking time off and posting which is a real boon for all of us ... have a real nice relaxing holiday ..regdsHarri
Thanks ozmousePics are very good and clear. Thank you very much.. please upload more
Can anyone comment on the beach. Is it as small and rocky as it looks on the photo's? Are there enough loungers for all? Don't want to fight for space on our honeymoon.
"I was thinking the same when I seen the pictures of the bech, looks a it rocky. Going there with teenagers so hoping that the beach is ok for swimming"
I would really appreciate comments on the beach too - does not look great and i am supposed to be staying for my honeymoon.
"Good afternoon. Booked a room in the middle of May. But the beach photos very disappointing, not at all like the picture of the brochure and photo on the hotel site. Can it be so awful? In correspondence with an employee of the hotel, he argued that the beach is sandy, and the photo except rocks and debris, I saw nothing. Maybe someone else has been recently, please share the information."
"I can't see how the photos would lie? If they looked amazing then I would think they might have been photoshopped etc but if they are guest pics, then I would say that's what it looks like"
"Just back from Akaryn, here is a life report. The hotel is amazing but it is still under renovation. For those who are interested in going to swim in the beach, I'm sorry to disappoint u. The photos didn't lie, it is rocky and absolutely not suitable to swim."
"Very sad to hear that, was looking forward to the beach, sort of defeats the purpose of staying right on the beach. Now deciding whether to continue with our booking or looking elsewhere! Last time in Samui stayed down near Coral cove and the beach was great. I know they have a pool but was really looking forward to swimming in the beach."
"If you are looking to swim on the beach I am afraid the beach is not the best as it is very rocky as other have written. We stayed at the hotel over Easter whilst you can swim in the water, there are a lot of rocks around. Some people did swim, in the water however I did not personally feel totally comfortable given the amount of rocks. If you are looking in particular for a beach to swim you may be better looking at another beach side resort, if you want a beautiful view, by the beach and are happy to wade about in the water it is probably ok."
Thanks for the reply regarding the beach. May just wait a bit longer before making a decision based on further reviews. Hopefully there will be more reviews in the ner future.
"I've just check into the resort tonight n been here for 4 hours. I'm already feeling disappointed and regretting chosing here over InterContinental. I'm not judging the location and environment for now but only on the service - unattentive and unresponsive. For example no toothbrush in the bathroom so I thought it would be provide upon request- I understand. So i called room service but I've called 3 times n no one ever picked up the phone; then I called duty manager n luckily someone finally picked up after my 2nd try. She didn't seem to understand me on the phone, so she came over, she did n said would come back to give me what I asked for, but she vanished n never returned; Also Staff dont seem to be proficient in English i doubt if they understand what I need. Hotel biz is all about customer service and this place is not meeting international standard and does not have what it takes to become one if this service quality persists. Lastly I cant believe they don't provide shavers, not even upon request!"
Hi VoiceofchanStarting to question my booking now. What is around the resort? is their anything outside like a 7/11 or any restuarants or is it totally isolated. Is it easy to get tuk tuks or will they need to be organized by reception staff due to location? Is the resort finished yet and have they been clearing the beach as stated.
"Hi stefwano, The beach is still very rocky, u can't really call it a 'beach' at all. Rocks everywhere u won't want to get into the water. It's pretty isolated here so have to rely on the shuttle or taxi, but to be fair I think this comment applies to many resorts on this island (e.g. W hotel I visited today, awesome view). The resort is about 90% done, I guess only little fixes left!?!? When I returned to my room tonight, a note from the hotel manager was there on my bed apologizing for inconvenience caused and has been trying to reach me but in vain. I appreciate the prompt action from the management n see what happens next :)"
"Hello all! Sorry about being missing in action... just hit the ground running upon return from holidays. So yes the Akaryn has opened and I was there in early april during soft opening/tail end of construction phase.As reported above, i have similar experiences with service and opinion on the beach.I believe service issues will not be an issue going forward, and indeed this is what might set the Akaryn out from the rest of the pack. The beach however is an issue that cant go away. Yes the beach was disappointing for me. And yes it is private and secluded with no other hotels on it. And yes they are trying to make it better, by moving rocks and cleaning up the flotsam and jetsam that gets washed up. But if you are looking for a long beach of white soft sand that you can walk on, or that you can run in the water or do leisurely swimming, this is not the beach for you. Especially when you look at the other options available on Samui. On the other hand, if you want a private beach without vendors, this is the beach for you!Posted other comments & pictures heretripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1179396-d25492…(Apologies for pictures posted in haphazard order by software - i had them in a order)Any further questions?"
"Stef,It is isolated on its own beach with a long drive from main road <1km long. At the end of the drive is a 7-11, ATM, and a strip of shops. A couple massage shops, and a couple of restaurants. Nothing of note however. We walked to choeng mon beach approx 2kms, bigger village and great beach! but in thai heat this is not for the faint hearted. songtheow would be the go.We also were going to walk at night, but were dissuaded by staff, due to security concerns!?!? they organized us comp transport to next resort for dinner. We also walked to road and hopped on songtheow into chaweng, 10 min drive, sorry cant remember cost."
"Continuing my review, the manager, Tor, contacted me again the next day. He was sincere and apologetic and basically offered anything he/ the hotel could to rectify the situation. I was gratified by the prompt response and by the fact that the management listens and tries to improve. Overall speaking, I had a pleasant stay despite hiccups in the beginning and would like to thank Tor here for his great hospitality during the rest of my stay."
"Thats a hell of an about turn between #132 'The beach is still very rocky, u can't really call it a 'beach' at all. Rocks everywhere u won't want to get into the water'.and #135'I had a pleasant stay'"
Sorry I should have made it clearer...I meant in terms of service only.
"I had a pleasant stay for 4 nights last week and truly appreciated the helpful staff Mai and the others in offering me the best pool suite and the constant water replacement to my plunge pool after the rain !Loved the breakfast most which cannot be missed, especially enjoying it facing the sea !Loved the soft couches too, always being hijacked by guests from morning till dawm :-PYeah, beach is rocky and is not comparable to those soft sandy ones but the overall tranquillity, service and amenities of the room together with their room rates. that's really a good find !"
"Stayed for 7 nights. Impressions ambiguous. A very small area, the rooms are almost right next to each other and may take several years until the plants planted take root and grow large enough to cover the numbers from each other. Rooms are spacious and equipped with everything you need. Breakfast is very good. The biggest disappointment is the beach, it is not there. We believe advertising booklets and answer e-mail from the hotel staff that you can swim in the sea without any problems, but it is not. I tried to go gently into the water and ripped his leg, all in the bottom of sharp rocks. Most will not go there."
"Dear All,Thank you for your continued comments on your visit to AKARYN Resort and Spa. We have now completed our 2nd month of opening and in the month of may welcomed over 520 guests to the resorts from across the world. We are delighted with the feedback we have recieved and our team are continuing to work very hard to ensure guests have a fantastic stay with us. With regards to the most recent reviews we have invited those who did stay in April and May back to us who were not completely satisfied with the resort as we are confident with the daily improvements we have made we offer an excellent escape on Koh Samui and Thailand. The month of June is going to be another wonderful month for us as we complete further planting to ensure our Residences are private. We have noted comments on our beach very seriously both positve and negative. Many guests have commented on the excellent quality, privacy and snorkelling from our beach. Some guests have commented that it is not like Chaweng Beach for Swimming or that in front of the resort there are rocks directly there. There is ample space for swimming along our beach and we are making further plans to enhance this experience even more. Versus Chaweng Beach we offer 400 metres of seclusion versus with only 52 Bedrooms on our beach versus 10,000 rooms that are located on Chaweng Beach itself. I am delighted to help personally should any of our guests have any further questions or if I can assist in any way prior to your arrival at AKARYN Resort and Spa.
