"Just spotted this and thought i would share for those interested what things are like out there at the moment. Town - https://youtu.be/XwFxtrBjjR4Beach - https://youtu.be/zWUxWnxR1bUEdited: 10:01 am, August 09, 2020 "
.Her videos are always great!.
"In three weeks the Spanish holidays will be over, Torremolinos is already quiet, more than 40 % of businesses have closed and won’t reopen, in September it will be deserted, it’s so sad, and it’ll be permanent, it’s not going to miraculously return next year, and unlike turista I live here so can tell it how it is"
Every business I know in Torremolinos is open. A tough summer but they’re all ticking over. Have you a link to a reliable (i.e. not the EWN or Olive Press) source of this 40% nonsense you’re posting?
"I totally enjoyed watching these two videos! Not able to travel there yet (US no-travel mandate, US not allowed in, flights canceled), it warmed my heart to see the center, La Carihuela (my favorite area and where I stay when there), and passeo walks. As expected, heard mostly Spanish language but glad people are there no matter where from. Maybe next year for me..."
"La Carihuela looking more like May than August, but all the businesses are open and at least it’s quite lively!"
Great video's thanks for posting..x
"I enjoyed the vids thanks. Brought back some nice memories. I'm more optimistic than Posada. I obviously can''t see into the future but I hope things will improve for everywhere, not just Spain."
Brilliant video..I really miss Torre.
"Watching the video from plaza del Remo to the Melia, brought back happy memories of a walk I have done 1000's of times.As NSG remarks good to see the majority of outlets open and some of my watering holes quite busy for 10pm, which is early to eat out in mid summer.I still hold out faint hopes for our October visit."
I'm supposed to be going in September from the UK - still want to go but the government advice is not to travel - however my flight has not been cancelled. I think I can also get insurance against covid so wondering if anyone else is doing this or is it just me being mental?
"If you’re not in one of the vulnerable groups then the balance of risk is probably in your favour. It’s important though to be aware that across Spain the number of cases is rising quite rapidly (over 3,000 new ones yesterday) and that whilst Andalucía is currently one of the least-affected regions this could change. Unless you buy specific ‘danger regions’ insurance it’s very unlikely you’d be covered whilst UK FCO advice regarding Spain remains ‘necessary travel only’."
"The overall Spanish positive figures at the moment are 90 per 100,000, compared with 17 per 100,000 in the U.K.on this basis unlikely the 14 day isolation on return will be removed in the near futures."

"MT: Were all counting figures differently, the U.K. figures include deaths after 28days from positive.We should maybe look at hospital admissions, although our positive cases locally second highest in the U.K., measured last 3 weeks, we have had no Covid hospital admissions this month and thankfully no Covid deaths for two months.What all the figures show is location does not matter, once you let large groups in close contact the virus will spread."
