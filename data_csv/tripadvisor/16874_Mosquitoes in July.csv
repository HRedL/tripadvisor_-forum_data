"Hi,How bad are the mosquitoes in Chiang Mai in early July? We are traveling with a pregnant family member, and are especially worried about chikungunya and dengue. Is it pretty common, or will we be okay with a mosquito repellant spray? We read about the increase in cases of chikungunya in Thailand in general, and were starting to get concerned. Thanks in advance!"
"More of them lately as rains increase. Not huge swarms or anything too alarming, just noticing them more lately in the evenings. DEET-based repellent spray helps quite a bit and is readily available. Often comes down to the individual person, as some taste better than others. Also they are attracted to dark/black clothes and hair. Sitting with a strong blowing fan also keeps them away. It's the female Aedes Aegypti (zebra striped) mosquito you want to avoid, which are active mornings as well as evenings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti"
Loads of mosquitoes throughout the year. Take the usual precautions.
There are some around but nothing to be too concerned about so long as you wear a repellant and perhaps cover up a bit. Considering the rain lately I have less at my place than 6 weeks ago.

"Yikes. We wouldn’t be too worried except that we have a pregnant family member, and it would be nice to not have her contract dengue or something that could harm the fetus. We might have her sit this one out if it seems like the situation is getting worse.. better safe than sorry."
"That would be up to the person to deicide . All travel has some risk.While , I do not want to sway a person one way or the other, often media reports need checking.Yes the facts are clear, there is more cases this year.You also need to look passed the ""Headline"" and understand the facts. For example if cases are up by 100% on last year. Is it also 100% more Tourist and what is the total number.2 of my partners cousins where admitted to Hospital , with Dengue about 3 years ago. There are rice farmers from the north, so stomping around in Rice Fields. They live in the Normal open air Thai Housing you see in Rural Thailand . Yes they do cover up , probably use little if any spray.I agree there is risk...you just need to understand what it is .Chok Dee"
"This seems to be the news every year, all I can say I am yet to come across anyone personally that had had dengue fever. If you spend most of your time around the city and nearby areas, take the usual precautions you are unlikely to contract anything. As I stated previously and contrary to some earlier posts I have less mosquito's at my place now than a month ago."
