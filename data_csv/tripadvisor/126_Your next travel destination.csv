I don't know why I couldn't think what that was....well I shake my head.....I feel like I'm losing it...lol.
"The Post Office, i need stamps. Badly."
Beer store !
Tee hee Lori. Walt Disney World.That's My bad. No really. A little narccassistic/narccsasisttik/narssasystick/narcississtic/self involved of me. KIK.
"#2 Lori, you were going to the kitchen to make a cup of tea.Remember now?The kettles boiled, well, rather the contents of it have."
Egypt of course!

"Nef, checked the Sharm forum? Your input may be valuable."
"Will head back to Rome (I'm currently in US) as soon as I can. Was supposed to go for several weeks at the end of April, that's probably not going to happen ....I also want to book a cruise out of Copenhagen to a few of the other Scandinavian countries with 2 days in St. Petersburg, for my 50th birthday, late summer .... we will see if that happens."

I will drive straight to Ottawa. I wish to thank them personalty for there actions in this difficult times.I was planning a mooning ceremony.
"A mooning ceremony. HahahaEngland, of course, attempt number four.Just eating for virgin Atlantic to cancel our flights so we can get a full refund on the Doomed May trip."
"Living apart from my family, I feel like I cannot wait for travel restrictions to be lifted so that I can go back to Greece and re-connect with people in a non-virtual manner. My planned trip for July still stands and I am hopeful it won't be cancelled, although like everything else it is up in the air (unfortunately only metaphorically)."
"Well, just had to cancel 8 flights, and not sure if this one will happen, either: trip to Blackberry Farm, via TYS airport, for wife’s birthday in late May, plus our 7th time doing their Hospice du Rhône wine event.As we have to connect somewhere, to fly UA, I was excited to fly PHX-ORD-TYS, and return, and get the new CRJ-550 between ORD-TYS-ORD in FC. New plane, with enhanced FC for a Regional Jet. The way things are looking, my maiden voyage on the CRJ-550, might not be until later?Hope that things settle, and that trip is still on?Hunt"
"I can't wait for my parents to be able to visit us again (Germany to the US) once it's safe.As far as personal travel, Peru is still on top of that list."
My friends and I had already planned (and paid for) a trip to LA in August. I’m crossing my fingers that all of this ends sooner than later so that we can enjoy some nice weather.

"There sure are a lot of optimists here.Optimistically I hope to be in Tanzania next February, but I think that may not be likely.This thing is just getting going. China has just shut its borders and things are crazy in the US."
"I have a trip to Nova Scotia planned in September. Maybe it will be ok, maybe not. If not, then next year :)."
"Not sure this situation will be over before the end of the year, but I’m DYING to work down my bucket list. My trip to Albania got cut short, so I’m most likely going to finish that one and possibly combine it with North Macedonia. If it turns out that it’s more convenient to do group travel then it’s gonna be Georgia (the country)."
Key West in June if back up running.
"Isla Mujeres in Quintana Roo MX. We were supposed to go in April, but..... Rebooked for end of June, beginning of July. Hoping we’re good to go by then ! Also, airfare is ridiculously low now, so in my opinion, book now. If it’s not doable, you’ll always have the credit!"
"Our Alaska cruise in May will be cancelled, will try again next year. Still hoping for a Michigan - Quebec - Boston road trip in October."
"We're booked for Akumal, MX at the end of June. Logically, I know it probably not going to happen, but I just haven't been able to bring myself to cancel yet."
Provence in July if I'm very lucky and Cordoba in September.Suspect they’ll be cancelled along with the other 3 trips this year.Going to have a stack of hotel and airline credits to use up!
"The Canary Islands for me, just 4 hours on a plane from Speke airport, on a cold winter morning and land into glorious sunshine, with the temperature in the 70s"
HiWe have just had to cancel one 21 night trip to the Dominican RepublicWe are lucky enough or now perhaps unlucky enough to have another two trip already booked. One 21 night trip to Mexico in June / July and another 12 night trip to Dominican Republic booked for October
Going to Rome... Rome around ourgate at the top of ourgarden.
Going back to Virgin Gorda - we were supposed to be on Virgin Gorda in April but we're stick in Toronto looking at Youtube videos - maybe in May.
"Since our cruise and extended Northern Ireland travels had to be canceled, we are starting to plan a FALL Yosemite trip."
"I was supposed to go to Myrtle Beach, SC and The Great Smoky Mountain National Park in April.Hoping to go in late May or June if I can."
Depends when it is over and if I'm still alive.All trips this year have been cancelled.Trump says it will be over in 2 weeks.
"We have booked Costa Rica 4/24...will cancel. Have a 10/4 trip to Australia/New Zealand...good chance will have to cancel. Have a Rhine River Cruise scheduled 10/3/2021...that one MIGHT still be a go.We (like so many others) had a rough 2018 and 2019. 2020 was supposed to be our travel year. We booked 6 trips-1 has happened, for which I am grateful.Every day is a waiting game to see what cancels, and how it ends up being resolved."
"The Michigan U.P. Hopefully in mid June. I have a cabin on a lake rented for most of a week. It's the only real vacation I have planned this year. Lots of hiking, waterfalls, lighthouses, and stuff. I'm holding out hope that it's pretty calmed down by then.It'll be about 3 more years until I can ramp up my travels a bit. I want to get back to Orlando and do the Star Wars area at WDW. I also want to see Yellowstone/Grand Tetons NPs and take an Alaskan Cruise."
Try to visit local restaurants that will be struggling financially after this virus is over and contained.Then back to couples negril early 2021
"We had three great trips in 2019, ending January 2020. Peru, Scotland, and Argentina/Uruguay/Brazil/Chile. Nothing planned next, but would love to do another road trip, featuring Georgia, Azerbaijan, Romania, and/or Bulgaria."
"Luckily I didn't have anything planned, so no cancelling, regrets etc. I feel very sorry for those of you who had to cancel indeed, especially those embarking on long intercontinental journeys which needed deep research and quite a financial investment.Actually looking backwards I consider myself lucky enough to have been in Florence for a weekend break in early February. Given the fact we don't know when we'll be able to travel again, this past escapade now seems like a luxury treat to me.Anyways I'm already thinking about a trip to Morocco, a country which intrigues me a lot. Rabat, Meknes, Fes and Marrakech, a great classic.Hope to finalize the planning process as soon as these unfortunate events will be over."
Hopefully we can still make it to Society Islands in September for a Wind star cruise.
Germany (my go to destination) in September I hope.
Costco!!! Then my hairdresser...
My last holiday (late Feb) - cancelled. Next holiday (end of April) - cancelled. Next upcoming pending holiday (June) - my guess 66% chance cancellation. Don't even want to speculate beyond that.
Hopefully a volunteer work trip to build a school in Burkina Faso.

"AGREED - support the locals! Then we're heading to Yellowstone/Grand Tetons in September... thankfully we just finished 2 weeks in Panama right before everything started exploding, so thankful!"
First back to my favorite restaurants around town!Then Amsterdam in SeptemberAnd Laos & Thailand in NovemberFingers crossed!
"We're planning to visit Granada - then Gibralter, and then Tangiers. We were hoping for September but think we might have to postpone a few months. We visited Morocco last year, but never got to Tangier. We're looking forward to this trip and I'm just beginning to plan it."
Amsterdam. Planned on going next week but postponed until further notice. Never get tired of the place.

"Next trip will be back to NE to visit family.Next vacation will probably be a flight out to SF and about 2 wks visiting Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, Lassen Peak, Crater Lake, maybe Mt St Helens, then down the Oregon and CA coast back to SF."
"I've paid Delta for flights from Glasgow to JFK early June and hope things might have settled down by then, but doubt it and will probably be issued with a voucher for another flight. Glad we didn't book a hotel in Manhattan and hear of cases where booking sites are slow responding to customers who've had holidays cancelled."
"To Bangkok Thailand and Ubud,Bali.. this is our trip that we already cancelledbut we would like to book this one again when this is over.we were taking our daught, with us, who is a registered nurse and is sooo disappointed that it's cancelled. But, she I needed here now. Bangkok and Bali will still be there when it's over."
"First and foremost a good long trip to the mall! And a walk along the river (why is the river closed?)Then, on to Boracay, Philippines. Only one island away (7 hour bus ride). Too easy, and been there numerous times. But it is one of the top beaches in the world. But I sure miss the old annual week in Kissimee..."
"We would love to go to northen Italy since we canceled our trip for this May, but right now we have a flight booked for October to go to Switzerland. Since we will probably have to use it within a year, we will go to Switzerland once all this in under control and keep Italy on our list."
My friend and I have booked for Sorrento in August so hopefully we will he able to go. Then back to Egypt.
"Italy, I have been planning this trip for a year."
"My next travel destination will be in my own country, the only area where we'll be allowed to travel for a while.Then possibly the European Union will open if the different countries can agree on anything, which is not clear right now."
We are supposed to be going to Mexico in June but my wife just received a letter telling her to stay in for 12 weeks which takes us past that date. Our life is on hold.
Scotland. Did Ireland in 18. Not Scotland with our wonderful guide Sean Patrick O'Rourke. May or 2021.

"Had Sorrento booked for beginning of June, obviously not happening. NYC booked for last week in August...who knows? Nerja in October again who knows.All the places we love Italy, Spain and NYC are having such a horrific time just hope it slows down soon."
"It was supposed to be North Bengal, India in April but that got cancelled. I have a trip planned in June to Manipur, India so don't know about that."
"Well, this June we had planned on renting a yacht with friends and doing a gastro-wine sail around the Croatian islands for my wife's 60th. Cancel that. Plan B was to do an extended road trip around the Gaspe, Nova Scotia (we are on East Coast).Cancel that. Plan C, pushing things into future....Now we are going to try a 10 day West Coast Wine road trip from Portland to SFran in early Nov. Things hopefully will be ""normal"" whatever that will be.Next year Tanzania, we love safari. Cheers, be well."
"My trip to Romania and Bulgaria in May has already been cancelled. I'd also booked a trip to Cambodia for November, but seriously doubting that will go ahead either :("
Y do you think. If we are in until nov. The COVID-19 virus won’t have killed us we would’ve killed me each other. HA HA. Or we will die from being morbidly obese because we can’t get out to do much.
"If the infection doesn't calm down we won't be going to Puerto Vallarta in June. And if it doesn't calm down enough in the fall, I'm thinking that a good thing to do that is relatively safe, (as long as it's completely sanitized) is to rent an RV as a way to travel. We've had some wonderful RV trips in the past...3 weeks in Colorado was one of the most relaxing trips we've ever taken in our lives. You're ""at home"" in an RV, you have to get groceries just like at home, and you have to get gasoline. So the only difference I can see is that the shower houses at the campgrounds might be a bad idea. However it's all soap and water in there. But, RV's do have their own showers, so there's always that.Edited: 8:30 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"None booked, but I have itineraries planned, hoping/dreaming/praying:July, Alaska - Denali, Katmai, Kenai Fjords National ParksAug. British Isles, Brugge/Brussels, AmsterdamNov. Galapagos Cruise"
"I'm looking forward to a trip to Budapest, Vienna and Prague in late Nov/early Dec to visit the Christmas markets :)Stay safe everyone ... Pray that life will go back to normal very soon."
Nothing exotic and I'm not betting on travel in 2020 at all... but I would love to simply have my old annual schedule back on the calendar! A trip in May/June then again in Oct/Nov. Puerto Vallarta or Honolulu.
Can't wait to return to my happy place.......Croatia ❤️
"We have four weeks booked touring around South Africa in mid August. Tour operators are only looking to reschedule tours that commence up to the end of May so we'll wait for a few months and see what happens. Worst case scenario we will be able to change our flights and accommodation already booked to anytime in 2021 from what I have been advised, so far. Although SARS did not affect as may people, we had a holiday booked in Vietnam in 2003. We decided we were going regardless and flew out a week after they were declared SARS free."
"Disneyland Paris. We live in Belgium and are completely hooked on it, we've had annual passes since 2012. We were actually there during the outbreak in France on March 13th. It was really weird having walked around in the parks on Friday and waking up on Saturday to what seemed to be an and of the world movie we got stuck in. Suddenly the parks had closed already without prior warning and everybody had to get out ASAP.Didn't feel like Disney magic at all, it bummed us out so hard we're really looking forward to a new trip to get that sense of magic back. Other one would be Salou, Spain for us. We've been going there twice a year since 2010, yet had decided we would skip 2020 because we're building a house and well, we can't complain about our income but aren't THAT rich that we can do as we please. ;-) After months of ""we're not ging, we're going to save up for our house"" we saw that prices for October 2020 really were ridiculously cheap and we were at the verge of caving and booking when corona hit Europe. Meanwhile we've booked a fully cancel-able pay at arrival hotel just in case we can make it, but we're not booking flights or anything we can't just cancel without loss until we know what the situation will be like by then.I'm crossing my fingers we can make it but I'm trying not to hope for it to much seeing as I assume it'll have to be 2021. I'm an optimistic person and I'm sure we'll beat this nasty virus over time but I think you also need to be realistic and realize we won't be on the beach sipping cocktails by next month, as much as we would all no doubt like to be."
"I can’t disagree with Audrey Hepburn. Paris is always a good idea. :)Edited: 4:27 am, March 29, 2020 "

"Probably mentioned this already...the one we missed in April, Angsana Cayo Santa Maria resort in Cuba....whenever that will be."
"It will be a small day trip I think something I can do in under 4 hours. Probably drive to the beach below Queen Street, hang out for half an hour. Pick up some take out from The Goof if it is open. Grab a cone at St. Clair's yup that would be an amazing day."
Italy. I already have my tickets to italy in October
"We had to cancel our trip to France (March), Italy (May) and Croatia (June). At this point, we expect to head to Seattle for cooler weather in July and to Santa Fe for the opera in August, but the opera board may cancel the season. Greenland is on our schedule for September, but I am not counting on that happening."
"Well, the Santa Fe Opera will not be one of our upcoming destinations. The 2020 season was officially cancelled yesterday."

"I've cancelled three trips so far, fingers crossed for Portugal in September.However, I do have a caravan parked outside the house, if our lockdown continues much longer, I've decided I'm having a weekend away 'sur l'allée de garage' ......deckchairs and all! :-))"
Have already cancelled a couple of trips. Next trip due is Thailand in August and hoping to be able to move the flights to Christmas/ early January. Am hoping to travel within Ireland towards end of summer
