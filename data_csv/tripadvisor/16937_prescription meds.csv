I need to take my prescription meds into costa rica for my personal use. With all the news articles lately about the Opioid Epidemics I am not sure if I will be allowed to take them from Canada to US and US to Liberia
"As long as the meds are sealed and if you have a Dr prescription not a problem,,,that will be from USA to LIR...no idea from Canada to USA...Here at LIR even with out Dr prescrption...but it will help! Just in case!!Roadadvsiro 100% costa rican indian / NativeTravel ProfeSional"
"My family travels from Canada to Costa Rica via the U.S. regularly, and have never encountered a problem with our prescription meds, which at times have included opiates. If they are in their original containers, and your name is on them, you should have no problems."
"Thanks, I wasn't sure because of the Opiate epidemic here in N. America."
"Thank you, McEdmonton.I have never used a computer to talk to anyone until this.Thank you. It actually is helpful, go figure!"
