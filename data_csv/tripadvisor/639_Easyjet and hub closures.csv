"Over the past 6 months I have had three cancellations for Easyjet flights to Palma. Instead of a refund I opted to change dates to end of year and for holidays in 2021. I normally fly from my local airport - Southend - or Stansted for winter visits. I was aware that Easyjet were looking at closing a number of hubs in UK but they had indicted that flights would continue. However, they have announced today that Stansted, Southend and Newcastle will close as hubs and flights from those airports will end on 1st September.There are alternative airports - Gatwick and Luton but Southend is such a joy to fly from compared to other London airports. It won't stop us coming to Mallorca - now we will have to face the joys of the M25 motorway for the first part of the journeyEdited: 12:29 pm, August 17, 2020 "
That had been talked about as they had to make cuts. A shame for local people employed there and at other regionals facing the same.https:/…3fampAre you not still in PdeP luckjon?
"No. Finally returned a couple of weeks ago and can't wait to get back, but travel insurance restrictions mean it will be sometime before we can make it."
"This is sad to hear as you say this will mean jobs for local people gone which is most important. Do you not feel that the demand for these, should mean a return to close to ""normal"", would see Easyjet return to these airports, flights any way? Perhaps they had their eye on this move any way and covid19 has allowed them to go that way earlier."
"Southend is also our airport of choice being very close to home and also much easier to get through than Stansted & Gatwick.Our September flight to Majorca is showing that it is possible to obtain a refund, But we were due to go to Croatia this month on a cruise and transferred our booking to next year, we booked with a company but they use Easyjet flights, on Saturday we paid an additional premium to fly Dubrovnik to Southend, it is disappointing in that it was only two days later the announcement was made.Also sad for Southend airport owners, the airport has been doing so well since it was brought out by Stobart, I know two people that work there whom I assume will be made redundant along with many others in the country."
@luckjon three are companies out there which will cover you even against FCO travel recommendations; e.g. Battleface Insurance.
#5; thanks but I have tried numerous options but being over 65 excludes Covid-19 cover. I am currently researching a story in yesterday's MDB that the Balearic government provides guaranteed travel assistance coverage for Covid-19 patients (similar to the scheme operating in Canary Islands) but it is difficult to find out more at the moment.https:/…private-clinics-covid-majorca.html
#6. Luckjohn. Also read it but thought two things it was MDB and possibly lost in translation but interested to hear eventually from other sources.
I have emailed editor of MDB asking for source and details of this story.I think it is important to know if this is correct as there are forum users who would love to visit Mallorca over the next few months but will not do so unless they have adequate insurance.
"I see Easyjet this morning started a marketing campaign for their flights in Sep and Oct are they privy to information that the quarantine may be lifted, are they only offering ban free countries or is it just wishful thinking on their behalf??"
"Stedoc. The airlines need the cash flow so keep tempting you to book , cancel then offer to to change or accept a voucher. Doubt if I’ll be flying until next year and still have ‘vouchers’ from 3 airlines. One is only €19 so not with effort pursuing so will just wait until things ever settle."
"Hi, @luckjohn did you find anything from MDB about the insurance ? Thanks!Edited: 4:31 am, August 20, 2020 "
"#11. No - they have not responded, although as CalviaDon suggested something may have been lost in translation. A response on another forum suggested that it was simply the Balearic Health Authority scheme which guarantees Covid-19 treatment for any visitors to the islands. I don't know for sure but it sounds plausible.Elsewhere on this forum there have been a few mentions of Staysure Travel Insurance. In the last few days they have added European FCO Travel Advice extension cover which ""does what it says on the tin"". If you already have insurance with Staysure this extension only costs £11 or you can get a quote for a single trip or whole year.Edited: 11:40 am, August 20, 2020 "
