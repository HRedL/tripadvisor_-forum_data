"As BillUK32 mentioned, the forum thread compiled by contributor minxbaby is a good source to follow up on the current status in Singapore. Other than that precautions have been taken by locals and authorities and it is safe to visit public places. Just remember to take common precautions like using hand sanitisers and washing your hands regularly.

"Aditi ... just a couple of comments regarding your posts.""...we will be visiting all public places with high rate of spread of infection""There actually is not a 'high rate of spread of infection.'Also,"" my kids like other kids that age are not gonna listen or wear a mask.""By all accounts from health care professionals, wearing a mask is not a preventative measure.Of course, your concern for the health of your children is understandable.

"I think it is misleading to say things like ""There actually is not a 'high rate of spread of infection.""I think the Government is the best judge of whether the rate if infection is high enough to call it DORSCON ORANGE. Once this is lowered, then the risk will be officially reduced. This is the only view with authority to say either way. If you are looking just at the official number of cases then this alone is insufficient as a measure to determine as there may be unreported people in self quarantine at home who are infected but don't know it, and their immune system is fighting it.Estimating the Unreported Number of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Cases...https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/2/388""The biggest breakdown yet of novel coronavirus cases suggests that 80% are mild.

"@ Prasanth, the link you have posted can be found in the pinned post at the top of the forum so there is no need to drag up old posts."
If I say “dont worry” than I will be bombarded... one of my relative caught the virus without knowing... thought was a common flu.. no fever. Was contacted by Govn staff (contact tracing) to do a swipe test... result positive and was warded... the next day was negative and so was the following day ... after that discharge... So the majority of the cases will be mild and feel like a normal flu ... what most sporean is afraid is the quarantine whether at home or at the hospital.. it disrupt ones daily life... if at home a bit better but you cant even go out to buy food... Even if you dont come to spore... you change your destination to another country.. can one guarantee that country will be free of Covid19 at that point of time... can you be sure those in the same flight with you are not infected
