"Found out yesterday our July 12, 2020 flight had been cancelled by Southwest. Threw a wrench into all our plans. Having to cancel our condo reservations now.Getting a refund"
"SW flights to Cozumel are cancelled until at least Aug. 11th.Edited: 12:00 pm, April 25, 2020 "
And Southwest CEO is saying they really may have to size down if the Corona problem does not pass soon.
"I am certainly not advocating travelingBut it seems like if any airline is strapped (they all are) then Cozumel would easily be one of the first service lines to go. United does not have daily flights or did not during the off season, SW only started and both have the option of flying into Cancun. I personally really prefer direct, and now more so as that limits the number of people exposures if you don’t have to take the ferry or a cab or a bus to Playa. But it seems understandable to me that Coz would be one of the first routes to go. My thoughts."
"I agree and friends at the airline where I worked, say the same. Cozumel will be among the last to have service restored and likely a very low priority with Southwest since a relatively new service."
"Why don't you fly into Cancun. As long as the ferry is running and the ADO bus or transfer services are, getting to Cozumel is easy."
The Cancun route works well if more flights are added before July as well as the airport buses and ferries who are not operating frequently now.
CO PilotCancun is not an option for us
"Yeah if possible I would fly into Cancun if possible, and make your way to Cozumel. Just curious are you not able to get a flight to Cancun instead?"
Curious about that also but know some just do not want to use the Cancun option. I use it but it is not for everyone
They can do as they wish but all things being equal and you have two choices:1) You can fly into Cancun to reach your hotel on Cozumel and have a great trip....or 2) Not go because there is not a flight into Cozumel..I would pick one.
"That's a no-brainerEdited: 9:04 am, April 27, 2020 "
"""That's a no-brainer""It is to me as well but I do not know their circumstances.I just wanted them to know of the option. If it does not work for them for some reason, that is their choice."
"Copilot really? I think he's well aware of what the options are. Maybe you shd have ended your ""contribution"" at I don't know their circumstances. Just a thought."

"I'm just wondering why anybody would go to Coz when everything is closed? Makes no sense at all. And we have been there MANY times. my dos cenrtavos. samEdited: 3:25 pm, April 27, 2020 "
Rex is talking about July. Things may be/should/probably be open by then.
"""Things may be/should/probably be open by then.""The longer things stayed closed the worse things will be for people in Cozumel, Cancun, Dallas, New York, Mayberry, etc.The unneeded closings in the name of safety was wrong."
"We all have our opinion , CP . And yours is well known on this topic. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, the officials did not ask us."
Blanket shutdowns are stupid and economic killers in normal economically diverse areas. In an area like Cancun to Tulum and surrounding areas heavily dependent upon tourism it is even worse.
"Well.. Scientist, epidemiologist, virus experts all disagree with your statements.Whom shall we believe, I think I will trust science on this one...Thanks anyway!"
"""Well.. Scientist, epidemiologist, virus experts all disagree with your statements.""Having lots of supposed experts who are all wrong does not make them right."
"So scientists, epidemiologists, and virologists are all ill-informed, but we should trust the point of view of an armchair conspiracy theorist on TripAdvisor instead? I think you’ve been under water too long.Edited: 8:32 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"Agree, Beyond. That Colorada mountain air must do strange things to a person. May be a DE here but definitely no expert on this topic."
"Sorry CO, I just lost a whole lot of respect for your posts on this forum.I hear a good shot of Lysol helps too!Edited: 9:49 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"Yes, agree that CO is sounding quite foolish. This virus is certainly a learning experience and enlightening in many ways."
"I have to say that I too would be tempted to travel come July, but only if Mexico is officially welcoming tourists at that time to its various destinations. (So I do not think CO_Pilot was that far off). However if Mexico is not yet open to tourism by then, then I guess it is off to the family beach house in New England. Stay safe and healthy everyone.¡Diviertanse!"
My trip isn't until end of August through the first two weeks of September. I'm keeping everything as is until its much closer. I fly into Cancun and out of Cozumel with AA. Hopefully every thing will be ok. But I'm flexible with airlines so will keep the condo reservations until july when everything is due. I don't want to rush cancelling everything then find out next month that it's not going to last as long as projected. This thing is changing every week it seems. I'm taking the sit back and watch approach. I can't imagine missing my yearly trip to my favorite place.
"""I have to say that I too would be tempted to travel come July, but only if Mexico is officially welcoming tourists at that time to its various destinations.""Yes, LSG. Please do let us know when it is safe for us to go to Cozumel without your judgement LOL.Last weekend we pushed our trip out from early May into late June.It's a pretty fluid situation, requiring us all to make our own decisions based on our own information."
"The bag drag would be extra tricky with only two ferries a day running. I wouldn't plan THAT trip right now.I hope you're able to reschedule at some point, Rex. As for the lockdowns...they're working. My uncle lives in LTC and has Covid-19. He normally spends every weekend in his own house, with his various offspring caring for him. If he'd been allowed out and about, he'd have spread it near and far. Short term pain, this too shall pass, etc."
"I'm with ya CO .. The media has people so terrified they cant think. The "" Science"" community ?? They cant agree WTH is going on . The hysteria and closing entire economies is doing more harm than good . In my area of Ky there has been less than 50 cases in a 5 county area. With have entire counties where there are zero cases. But the freak out mode goes on like the energizer bunny. Its like no one ever dies from Cancer , car wrecks , suicide , Type A influenza etc etc. Carry on ."
Coronavirus kills more people daily than cancer. Coronavirus kills more people daily that auto wrecksCoronavirus kills more people daily than suicideWe have treatment for many cancers. We have safety guidelines for traffic. We have suicide Hotlines and medications. We do not have treatment for coronavirus.
Normally I try and avoid all the debate on the political and scientific issues relating to this virus. But after reading Co-Pilot's posts I have to wonder if he truly believes all he says about the scientific experts being wrong or if he's just trying to stir the pot. Maybe he does believe it or maybe he just has issues with people who know more than he does. Who knows. But it might explained why he's a co-pilot and not the captain of the airliner. He seems to want to rebel against authority at every chance he can get.
"""Coronavirus kills more people daily than cancer. Coronavirus kills more people daily that auto wrecksCoronavirus kills more people daily than suicideWe have treatment for many cancers.

"""But it might explained why he's a co-pilot and not the captain of the airliner. He seems to want to rebel against authority at every chance he can get.""CO...as in Colorado.I am not rebelling. I am right in my views that a risk-based strategy would save vulnerable people and not destroy economies.Look at your area Joan. Look at the suffering that comes from the nuclear option (close down everything).Watch how many businesses will never reopen."
"""Yet Corona still hasn't killed half as many worldwide as H1N1 which the world didn't shut down for""Exactemente!Many of us still have fresh in our memories that during Swine '09 the CDC was absolutely clueless. Cozumel was relatively safe yet was painted with the same paranoia brush as the rest of Mexico. For that reason my company told me that if we went to Cozumel I would have to self-quarantine for 7 days upon my return. I was fine with that and we had a great trip. (The company backed off that demand one day before our departure, based on CDC guidelines.)"
Glad I checked in here today to learn Covid kills more people than cancer per day . Really reliable info. There were 627K breast cancer victims in 2018 . Just breast. So please stop with the misinformation its bad enough. Currently 213K worldwide for Covid .
"The WHO -- World health Organization stated Jan 23rd they didnt think it could be transmitted from human to human. And you folks tell people to "" trust those smarter than you"" . The medical community badly , horribly missed the model on death rate and best ways to slow this virus without crippling and totally destroying entire economies , causing terrible things to happen to people who were at really low risk from the virus anyway. The "" fix"" has been worse than the issue."
"Meanwhile....yes Rex, many Southwest flights have been cancelled."
Give your head a shake. No one is going to catch breast cancer sitting next to an inflicted woman on an airplane.
Johns Hopkins has total deaths at 215000 today world wide since the pandemic startedUS at 57000 https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.htmlH1N1 killed 12469 in the US. Worldwide somewhere between 150000 and 500000 estimates vary in the first yearSo coronavirus has killed more people in the US than H1N1 did. Your argument is inaccurate. And we still don’t have enough testing.
"Perhaps when you know two people who have died from this, as I do, you will adjust your thinking."
I am sorry Denver to Cozumel. Very sad.
Poor Rex. I'm sorry. You'll get there this summer I bet.
"""I am not rebelling. I am right in my views that a risk-based strategy would save vulnerable people and not destroy economies.""That's your opinion. And you're more than entitled to it. But it doesn't make you right or mean you know more than the experts in this field."
"Agree, Joan. Everyone can express their opinion here but does not necessarily mean it is correct. Like believing everything posted on Facebook.I tend to put more faith in what real experts say, no Trip Advisor experts."
"Well said Joan. People have a right to their opinion, unless it puts another person's life at risk."
"Then the "" other "" person should stay inside and not force their fears on people who dont feel that way. The viral response has been so entirely overblown and so unequally applied it angers people . Me included . I want sensible securities . I truly do , No huge crowds , No nursing home visitors and many other sensible precautions , But good lord the lady Gov in Michigan went nuts .. you couldnt buy paint , you couldnt fish ALONE from a motorized boat , you couldnt visit your 2nd property that you owned... but you still attend church ?? Its the non sense stuff that really gets me ."
You betrayed your bias with “lady Gov in Michigan.” Thanks for clearing that up.
Good point. Lady Governor!
Manitou. We live in a resort community on Lake Erie. I respect the gov of Michigan for shutting down fishing and boats. I look out my window and see hundreds of boats with many fisherman on them. Social distance ing not so much. Mostly out of state which is restricted but peeps ignore it. Bottom line. I respect that gov be and ours for their efforts.
"History is a great teacher. In a few years we can all look back and see what the risk/reward was. I know what I believe the lesson will be. I am in the minority in my belief, however my 63 year old beliefs are usually in the minority. Btw, the media always has their agenda. Only history has the facts."
"On getting to Cozumel, there is always an option. Just get there."

"And Colo Doug . I won't condescend , I'll just provide the information : https:/…"
Most people know The Who stated on Jan 23rd that Covid 19 could not be transferred from human to human .. I could link it if it makes you feel better .
"in case you don't want to click on the link from an MD that studied at Mayo Clinic ---- Fantastic News! The coronavirus pandemic is not as scary as we thought.In the last 2 weeks, surveillance data has shown that the Covid 19 virus is much more widespread than testing had been able to show, because of the limited testing previously available. As a medical doctor, I’ve been anxiously waiting for these results of antibody testing. The surveillance statistics from this shows the real numbers of people who have been infected with Covid 19. Two of the most recent surveys were reported in the Wall Street Journal’s interview (April 25, 2020) with Dr. John Ioannidis, professor at Stanford’s school of Medicine. He’s a well regarded expert in statistics, biomedical data, prevention research and health research and policy. The surveillance testing showed that in a random population in the Stanford area, the infection rate was between 50 to 85 times the number of previously confirmed cases. This data has been confirmed by surveillance studies in high incidence areas in New York recently.This is great because it demonstrates that the Covid 19 fatality rate is between .12 to .2%. This is far less than the initial reports of a fatality rate of 2 to 4 %. Also, of the fatalities, only 1% of the deaths involve people under the age of 65. Therefore the fatality rate for Covid 19 is .0012 to .002% for people under the age of 65. This rate is the same of most seasonal flu illnesses every year. This is the key statistic that all public health decisions are being based on."
I'm looking forward to everyones responses .
"""Also, of the fatalities, only 1% of the deaths involve people under the age of 65."" Meaning what?And to compare this to the seasonal flu, well, one would have to be blind and deaf, to do that."
Tell it to the Mayo Clinic trained MD I guess . Its what the newer numbers actually show .
"Who cares what a pediatrician who trained in the mid 80s thinks? He had no published articles in Pubmed, which would be required for promotion in an academic institute. He works in private practice and is not smart enough to know the other factor to look at on pandemics is the rate of spread. Rate of spread is very important and we are over one. You are pointing us to blogs and acting like it’s research. I am glad to see most people on this forum realize you are clueless. I am sure you will have to respond to get the last word in. I have to go finish my 35th pubmed manuscript. I don’t have time for you."

Looks like the far right hijacked this thread.
Manitou. Disrespectful and out of line. Someone please shut this down before it goes even lower. Way off topic.
"Not sure how this all got into a flight cancellation topic, but here's my 2 cents (stealing this from sam maybe?)Get the call from the doctor saying that your dad is covid-19 positive probably from the nursing home he's been in. His vitals are good, he's requiring a little oxygen, eating a little. Things look good right? Get the call today that they (Doctors and nurses) can't wake him up. They did oral therapy(brushing his teeth etc) and pulled 3 of his pills out of his mouth. He won't wake up! Pulled a few strings and was able to get into the hospital to see him. After suiting up, I have EVEN MORE RESPECT for the doctors and nurses that wear this all day. Low and be hold, I get to my dad's room and he was awake! The GOOD LORD answers many prayers, you just have to ask. The nurse informed me that he had been trying all day to wake my dad up. It was only when the wound care nurse came in to treat his bottom that he woke up. That should tell you how bad his bottom is thanks to the nursing home (thanks PC Healthcare, gotta give them a shout out). He was very tired and couldn't talk much. I was grateful I brought an ultrasound picture of his soon to be great grand baby. He was able to say it's a boy and he's been saying that since Christmas. Unless things change overnight, he will be put on hospice tomorrow and I will lose him in a few days. SO FOR ALL YOU UNBELIEVERS OF THIS DEADLY VIRUS, THIS S**T IS REAL! Heed the warning of your local government or you may be next. Thanks for reading"
Bless you Vicki my thoughts are with you and your family
"Sorry Vicki and hope your dad pulls thru , the threat to those above age 65 is really high ."
"Very sorry to hear about your dad's condition, Vicki.Prayers for you, Dad and family."
"Thoughts and prayers are with you Vicki. Lost my Mom last fall, glad she went on her terms and not Covid-19's.Whiskers"
"Thanks for all of your kind words and prayers. I haven't been able to make my yearly trip to Cozumel since 2018, due to my dad's health. The one thing that I always said was that when he was gone, I would be able to return with a free mind for MUCH longer than 2 weeks. Not sorry to say that I'd much rather keep my dad than return to the island, for a few reasons!"
"1. A new study of thousands of hospitalized coronavirus patients in the New York City area, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, has found that nearly all of them had at least one major chronic health condition, and most — 88 percent — had at least two.Though earlier research has shown chronic conditions like obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are common risk factors for severe Covid-19, the ubiquity of serious medical conditions in these patients was striking: Only 6 percent of them had no underlying health conditions.Source: https:/…coronavirus-patients-risk.html2. In Quintana Roo, 84% of deaths from COVID-19 are associated with diabetes , 74% of fatalities had hypertension and 47%, obesity , state health secretary Alejandra revealed in a video this afternoon Aguirre Crespo.Source: https:/…1064397453.

Could you reschedule to fly into Cancun instead? https://www.southwest.com/Coronavirus/…It says they are resuming June 7 to Cancun and June 28th to Cozumel.
SWA is not resuming flights to Cozumel until Aug 11. Our reservation to Coz for July 7 has been cancelled by them.
"I fly into Cancun and out of Cozumel on different airlines almost every year. I shop for cheapest, earliest, shortest flights I can get, So sometimes it's a one way with different airlines. When we started flying into Cancun I started booking a few days at Akumal, Tulum, Valladolid, and other places on the mainland. Now we do a week, this year Puerto morelos then go over to Cozumel for 10 days. It breaks up the bag drag and has opened up so many new places and wonderful people for us. It's not as hard as I thought before I did it the first time. Go out the airport door head to the ADO buses and on our way in comfort."
"Don't quite understand why the ""bag drag"" is such a big deal. Wife and I are old(er). Haven't had a problem doing that. SWA into Coz involves a layover in HOU of 5 hrs on down flight and 5+ on return. Frontier is non-stop to CUN of less than 3 hrs from STL. Hour comfortable bus ride.to Playa del Carmen. Downhill to ferry. Just don't see the problem."
Lots of people just don't like it. I use United and it gives me a short layover in Houston. I don't want to add 3 or 4 hours onto my travel time. I've done it but it's not my first choice. It'd be OK if I was staying longer than a week. I also really dislike how early I've gotta start back to Cancun on the return trip. And I don't like the Cancun airport.
"Flying into Cozumel or Cancun always involves a layover for us; we don’t have any direct flight options to either airport unless we want to drive 3.5 hours to another airport to begin our journey. Since we already will have a layover, we’d much rather fly into Cozumel and skip the additional time required to do the bus/ferry from Cancun. So some of the comments are comparing apples to oranges since direct flights are being compared to layovers. The good thing is we all have options and can make a decision based on price/times/layovers or whatever, and we are all happily ending up on lovely Cozumel!"
If one had mobility issues or medical needs then direct would be preferable. We all have our preferences.
"'Don't quite understand why the ""bag drag"" is such a big deal.'well, then you have been lucky on the weather. We had the pleasure of taking the ferry from PDC to CZM one night and my Queen of All Things used up every barf bag in our row. I will never be able to get her back on that boat, no matter the savings on airfare. Sam"
"Knock on wood, but I have been lucky not getting seasick on the rides we've taken, but wife religiously takes her Bonine to alleviate that issue for her. Ounce of prevention sort of thing. To each their own."
It doesn't happen often but have you seen some of the norte videos of the ferries? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zftEV7Bse9w
Co Pilot --Thank you for providing more facts on the Covid scare. I just got back from a trip to Detroit to see my son and nail some walleye in the river .
