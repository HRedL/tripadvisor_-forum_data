"I was reading some of the threads on the PV forums today and made a few observations. First of all, there is a great amount of back and forth rhetoric based on personal opinions, attitudes, and a myriad of emotions such as frustration, impatience, and anger. Well now, opinions are just that, and everyone has one, and they vary. Okay, but facts are facts. The one overriding fact that came through loud and clear on the PV forums is that no one wanted to address the elephant in the room. So let's see if we can shine a light on that subject.....The world is about to bear witness to the effects of a highly contagious and deadly pathogen unleashed in a poverty stricken third world nation in Latin America. On May 28th, the Mexico Daily News published a report out of MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One of their scientists came up with a projection based on current data and algorithms for epidemics. The program delivered a best case, worst case, and a probable case outcome for September 1 of this year. The probable outcome gives a number of 136,000 deaths by September 1st. Another scary number was that over 2 million people in Mexico are now infected with the virus, and one in every six will be infected by the end of summer. The worst case scenario is too horrendous to contemplate. The daily number of deaths and total cases in Mexico is beginning to skyrocket, and prevention is the only defense people have until a vaccine or a viral drug is created. The system will become overwhelmed. In the year 2010, the History Channel aired a docu/drama entitled After Armageddon, in which a number of Phd's discussed the effects a deadly pathogen/virus would have on society. It was considered a ""worst case scenario"", but very informative given the current state of our world. Mexico needs to contain this threat right now. And that is the only fact that matters, otherwise, everything else will become academic."
"""Mexico needs to contain this threat right now. And that is the only fact that matters, otherwise, everything else will become academic.""They tried lockdown, and that didn't work out so well. What exactly did you have in mind?"
yandoblu -Good answer and great question!!Perhaps OP has a vaccine in his/her back pocket!

"""...highly contagious and deadly pathogen...""Please cite your sources.The CDC reports a .004 case fatality rate."
Mexico is NOT a third word country.We will all removed 2020.
"JoLeen: your frequent posts are (mostly) helpful; however, a brief spell-check prior to posting would make them more intelligible. What are you attempting to say?"
To add to Joleen2's post # 5 - Mexico is also not in Latin America. It is considered the 3rd of 3 major countries on the North American Continent.
"I would just like to say that Mexico is about a month behind Canada of when the virus hit. A month ago, we weren’t so good either, but on Friday, Alberta is moving to phase 2 reopening. Our curve is flat. So let’s give Mexico another month or so to gets things under control before we even talk about flocking back there."
"to the OP ...Mexico doesn't have the best numbers , but it doesn't have a crisis...you're totally wrong...please check your facts before posting ...you're exactly like the ones you're complaining about in the first part of your long useless post...136,000 deaths ?....delusional..."

"statistics posted today in the Vallarta Opina; 120,102 cases and 14,053 deaths in Mexico. While those numbers are not great, they are a far cry from other countries. Mexico may not be doing the best job but balancing getting people to work and feeding their families is critical for the health of the economy too. Hotels are scheduled to begin reopening on 15 June at 30% occupancy in Nayarit. Mexico is not Canada or US and their plan must work for their people, so it might not look the same as what is going on in your town.Please come visit when you feel comfortable. We will be here to welcome you."
"It takes more than a typo to trigger me; although, I must admit that multiple misspellings and grammatical errors that render a thought incomprehensible are a bit annoying. I meant no disrespect towards JoLeen. For all I know, English is not her primary language (based on most of her posts, this may be the case). I simply asked for clarification. Anyone paying attention to the science knows that this virus is about as deadly (or less than) as seasonal influenza."
"tim...FYI...i'm a doctor...i don't need to pay attention...i know that this virus is not the same as the seasonal influenza...but i don't expect you to understand that...for you, many things seem to be incomprehensible...even a small misspelling, which in the days of fast tipping and autocorrection, is totally normal..."
"I never said Covid-19 is the same as seasonal influenza. If you are in fact a physician, you know as well as I that the CFR of Covid-19 is significantly less than that of seasonal influenza. Also, if you're able to, please attempt to decipher JoLeen's previous post; that's all I'm asking for."
"""this virus is about as deadly (or less than) as seasonal influenza""...what does this mean ?"
"salty...the question wasn't addressed to you...i was asking tim... maybe now he understands...but spikes occurred not since they lifted travel, because that is still not recommended, but since they lifted lockdowns...so this is community infections, not travel related...you seem to misunderstand the worldwide situation...exactly like the OP ..."
"It means that Covid-19, at worst, is as deadly as seasonal influenza and, at best (likely, given what we now know about there CFR of each), less deadly than seasonal influenza. You claim to be a ""doctor"" yet are unable to comprehend not-so-complex statements. PhD or MD?Still looking for clarification on JoLeen's most recent post on this thread..."
"I’m not a doctor, but common sense tells me this is much deadlier than the seasonal flu. US had over 114,000 deaths in 3 months. That’s deadlier, AND that’s with lock downs and distancing in place. If the world hadn’t done that, the death toll would be much higher."
tim...please understand...you're WRONG ! ...i'm an MD but you don't have to be a doctor to see how deadly this virus is...as for joleen...let it go...
I never said it's not deadly.
tim...you said it's as or less deadly than the yearly seasonal influenza...please stop...you sound like your president...
"salty...testing has nothing to do with the deaths...judging by those REAL numbers , mexico could have maybe have 50% more cases in the worst case scenario, but they have two things going for them...the virus has started spreading much later and they don't have the virus denial and indiscipline that has been going on in the states...as poor as they are in some places, the mask wearing is more widespread ...and please stop with the travel restrictions lifted...they weren't lifted ..."
"""you sound like your president...""Now we know your reason is based on emotion and politics, not science. No wonder you're so hard to get along with."
"Hey! Hey! Hey! We all are intelligent people! We all have our thoughts and many are very good! Some are good ! And some we get sideways on. What do you say that we get off the politics ( which most find differences on) , off the potential name calling and focus on the forum and Nuevo Vallarta. How about some of the intellect that I have seen on this thread trying to compute when you might think that the resorts, etc will be back at perhaps 60%"
"tim...it's based on you changing your tune every post...not politics...actually i would vote republican if i would be in us, but the guy changes his speech as it suits him and lies like no other...for sure i don't want to get along with this kind of person..."
"salty...opening hotels at 30% capacity with measures in place is more responsible than opening the beaches in texas or california or florida...now that was totally wrong...as for the testing, being a doctor, i'm not going to be persuaded by someone who doesn't really understand...you don't really need testing to count number of beds available in a hospital or number of deaths ...as of now most of the mexican states except for a couple of them have it well under control..."
Calmjohn...i think they will go to the next phase in a few weeks after the numbers from the 1st phase come in...just on time for schools to go back in...this way they won't have to deal with a lot of people cramming in the hotels...
"Alunelu - #30 I think that is a well thought out and good answer. Personally, I think you are very correct. That reason or timing had not entered my mind. It makes good sense. In basic words the travelers will to a large degree police or at least hamper their own travel reducing the number of people who can travel.On another note--has anyone noticed Keejs J threw out this topic and never posted once on this thread."
Hard to notice anything with you people bickering back and forth like children.
sunlover...thanks god for your adult mind...wow!
You're welcome.
"salty...i guess we'll see...but the fact that the mexican government has more level headed people in charge makes me quite sure that they won't be even close to what you and others say...as for staying healthy...you and the ones in the neighboring states should pay more attention than most mexicans, especially the ones in bahia de banderas region...Edited: 6:59 pm, June 10, 2020 "
I still wonder what happened to Keegs J. who started this thread.
looks like OP likes long posts...monologues... https:/…10
"The only problem with the ""reported"" numbers is that MX is far under reporting. They are only reporting cases in public hospitals not in private hospitals."
The medical experts who are knowledgeable about this and other communicable diseases say it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.
