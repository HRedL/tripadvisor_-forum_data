"Anyone else receiving ""please re-think your vacation"" messages....from BeSafe...asking you to go to the cancunvacationawareness site?These are tragic stories and similar ones hold true anywhere even near home sometimes...Are these messages meant to inform or scare people?I personally have been to Aruba twice (once before and once after the Natalee Holloway dissapearance) and I have seen similar posts meant to frighten people....but I felt safer in Aruba walking around in ally ways at night (not alone of course - I wouldn't do that in my own hometown) than in any other place I've visited (including many US cities) Ever been to DC, Memphis or New Orleans? I have and all can be great and dangerous...People have to protect themselves and make good decisions and stop trying to scare people from leaving their neighborhoods! This is why I can't talk my sister-in-laws into travelling!just my thoughts - don't thrash me for it too bad!"
"I haven't.And not that I would necessarily encourage this, because of what this woman has suffered through, but you might consider letting TA know.She only has negative things to say about Cancun, and while my heart goes out to her for her loss, I think she's directing her anger/grief at the wrong parties."
"Well, that's just it I thought about reporting it but I wondered if it was a problem or not?! Their message to me was simply reconsider your vacation and the website link...nothing too pushy but I don't like seeing these ""warnings"" here or on the Aruba site when (although tragic) these things can happen just as easily down the road from where we live than on vacation.... "
"Well I haven't gotten that message but I did go to the site just to check it out. It is all very sad and tragic but like you said, a lot of those things can happen anywhere. The two things that did bother me though were the open pool drains that claimed the lives of at least 2 children (how in the world were these drains allowed to be open???) and also the way the Mexican medical staff reacted to trained bystanders attempting to help (since no one at the resorts were). In one case, the man helping was a cardiologist in the US and also an emergency room nurse. Both were told to stop working on the child/young man because they were clearly dead already. Now as a parent, that would greatly upset me!If anything, going to this site did give me some ideas for our trip tomorrow--like I will probably not leave my kids at the kids club water park if the staff is not trained in CPR. And I will not allow my 11 or 9 year old to wander the resort by themselves (the one boy died when he was by himself and slipped and fell into the hot tub, hit his head and drowned ).It makes me sad that this site is attempting to blame Cancun for these deaths but I do look at it like if it can save even one life by making parents a little more aware than it's worth it. BUT, I don't think they should be ""stalking"" people on Trip Advisor."
I think I received the message because I had posted questions about Oasis resorts and her son died while staying at one of their locations....must not be an epidemic of warnings then...Have a great trip Nicole
