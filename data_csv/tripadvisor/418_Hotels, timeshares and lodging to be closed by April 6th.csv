"The governor of BCS has ordered that all guests must be out of these facilities by April 5th so they may be closed April 6th. (Cabo Mil News, Tribuna Digital, BCS Noticias)"
"The federales shut down the beaches in Loreto last night and they are actually starting to search gringo vehicles at the military checkpoints on Mex 1. I don't think its primarily about sending the gringos home, but more about trying to shut down the Semana Santa crowds before they start pouring in."
"Per Pueblo Bonitoâ€™s Instagram page, all PB resorts including those in Mazatlan will be closed until April 30."
Good for them!
"Kudos to the Govenor of Baja Sur for having the balls to close all hotels, timeshares and lodging, especially before the onslaught of tourists from Mexicos mainland. Also, to the hotels and timeshares who closed before they were mandated to do so. To all the rest that made excuses about why they were staying open shame on you. This should now because of no peopleple coming close the restaurants and bars. Hopefully the government will be forthcoming in the actual active cases and not hide it because of their precious tourist dollars."
"Unfortunately I think its inevitable that the COVID-19 will cause the Mexican resorts to remain closed thru May, and perhaps thru June as well. The opening is more based on when the tourists feel safe to leave their homes to travel. With luck that will happen sooner rather than later."
"Hi, Rocky.I have the feeling you're right.Scheduled for May 22 - 29 at Casa Dorada. Spoke with a Guest Services friend there yesterday.She suggested I wait until May 1 to consider moving the week to later in the year.Will be interested to see how they are able to balance and accommodate all the timeshare ""weeks"" moved to October and November with existing reservations for that time.Cheers."
"cmasia..........Yes the weeks available will be in short supply everywhere. Even if you bank your week, to redeem it later will be problematic too. Many will do the same, and our choices will be in very limited or unavailable."
"Rocky,How about a COVID-19 special assessment fee for timeshares? They got to get your money somehow!"
"Craig....That certainly is a very good possibility ! For Timeshare Owners not aware.....Special assessment fees can and have been charged for unplanned events that happen which cause a financial need. That dollar amount is passed to on all the Timeshare ""Owners"". If the Owners don't pay they do not have access to their weeks.Another reason why buying a Timeshare is such a Great Idea. : }Edited: 8:57 pm, April 02, 2020 "
