We are travelling to the city for 4 days this summer before we go to Yosemite. I have not been there in 20 years and this is first time travelling with kids. Are there any areas we should avoid due to safety? We are staying at the Parc 55 Hilton
Which areas are you going to ? That will help us help you. You have to be streetsmart as in any city and you will see homeless in the union square area but they are generally harmless so do not stare at them. To the left of union square around jones and Geary is the Tenderloin which is not an area to go at night nor is the civic center area again at night But neither is a tourist attraction. Other than that do check our neighborhoods enjoy sf. Be vary as in any city but not paranoid
"How old are the kids? And yes, some info on your planned itinerary while in the city would help. If your kids are under, oh perhaps, 10, then staying downtown might not be the most convenient to the things you want to see. If they're under 8, you have car seat requirements if using a vehicle of any sort (rental car, taxi, uber etc.)."
"If you have a rental car, do not leave anything of value inside. I have family that didn't get that warning in October and all of their luggage and possessions were stolen during their first few hours in SF."
This a popular topic here lately.

Thank you Elaine H. You've been a member since 2015 and this is your first post. Congrats and welcome to TA forums Might you be related to the poster from Pacifica -- Googling is popular these days -- why notEdited: 2 years ago 
I'm not sure one should need a specific warning to not leave all their valuables in a rental car in ANY city. I've helped people whose backpacks were stolen from their rental car in rural France and seen the 'sparkly pavement' from car after car broken into in Rome.
"To tell you the truth in North Carolina, I really never worry that much about leaving stuff in my car in any of our cities. I mean, I wouldn’t park my car in a sketchy neighborhood with a roll of hundred dollar bills on the dash but I leave bags and other items in my car all the time in all our cities. I do lock my car but we don’t seem to have the problem with breaking windows and snatching stuff here that you do there. Thieves will go through unlocked cars at night but it sounds like it’s a lot worse there."
"Hello Delaney,First of all, Welcome to San Francisco. The Parc 55 hotel is right on the 100 percent walkscore. The location is on Cyril Magnin Street and Eddy. Funny I stayed there 25 years ago and did not realized it now part of the Hilton Hotel. Used to be self independence hotel I guess Hilton hotel bought off Parc 55. I ate at the Thai restaurant and their food have real thai food very good restaurant. To go to the cable car just one block and it will be on your left side. You may want to plan your trip earlier because there usually a very long line to get on the cable car. I would recommend starting your day early in the morning to get in line to ride the cable. There two cable car line starting Powell and Market. One goes to Hyde and Beach which is closer to the Fisherman Wharf walking distance to pier 39. The other line is Taylor and Bay Street which is kinda on the border of Italy town and Marina which is little longer to walk to the fisherman's wharf. to learn more about the guideline of riding cable car here is the web site. There two ways to pay for fares is to use the mobile apps which I never done before the other way is the clipper card is an all transit loadable fare on the card to make it easier to purchases fares. You will need to get clipper card for each person and you can get those at any walgreen stores. The only downside is that it $3.00 to buy clipper card and $5.00 minium to load the fares. The mobile app may let you let you buy ticket at once for you, your husband and your kids with the quanity of ticket on one creid card or paypal. if you have question free free to post here."

"We have recently seen the ""sparkly pavement"" in the parking lot of a state park in rural Wisconsin, north of the Dells. Just goes to show - your car can be broken in to anywhere, any time, and if you leave valuables in plain sight it is more likely. Keep your street smarts as you should when out and about. Don't be flashy with money or valuables. If something seems sketchy or makes you uncomfortable, move on."
"SF does need a special warning. Yes, break ins can happen anywhere, but in SF, it's an epidemic. Some places are just like that. It's not about not leaving valuables in the car, it's about not leaving anything in the car."
"As I am planning our trip late this summer I really appreciate the heads up on the car smash-n-grabs. I will be more vigilant about not leaving anything in the car. Do you think it would be better to just leave the car empty and unlocked or is that a bad idea and inviting someone to steal the car?As I mentioned we do have problems with thieves getting into unlocked cars, usually under the cover of darkness. I had that happen once (somebody getting into my unlocked car at night) about 10-15 years ago when I had a cassette adapter for an iPod in my old VW. For some reason when the thief went to steal the iPod he didn't unplug the cord from the cassette adapter, he just cut it, rendering the cassette adapter useless. Wouldn't have taken any longer to unplug, but I guess he had his knife/boxcutter/whatever and was ready to slice. That was the only damage and it was an old iPod and I learned my lesson about locking my car doors. I wonder if thieves in SF are so used to smash-n-grab that they don't even try door handles?"
"I'd leave the car locked with nothing visible. If left unlocked, I'd would worry about someone trying to steal the car."
"My car hasn't been broken into in 10 years, either. I feel like these breathless stories about crime exaggerate things--just like every snowstorm is ""stormaggedon"" on every evening newscast if you live someplace where it snows. Sensationalizing is a lazy, easy way to get attention if you're a news writer.Crime has gone up some recently and it is a problem that I hope our politicians and Californians take seriously and don't give a pass to as some recent laws seem to to be doing more of. The ""Three Strikes"" laws didn't work and cost a fortune to jail everyone, so something in between those and making it so property crime a misdemeanor in many circumstances is probably warranted.Will your car get broken into if you leave anything in it? Probably not, but it might. Taking precautions is about being sensible considering the local conditions and not being naive about it, but also not exaggerating or sensationalizing the chances that it will happen. If you know it's a possibility then you can act sensibly for the possibility.The homeless are another issue and most are not particularly a safety issue. They can live here without freezing to death in the winter and some other wonderful cities where they come from can't be bothered to take care of their own so give them bus tickets and ship them here so . . . yeah . . . thanks for that.I suspect it won't be solved until there is a better solution nationally and I don't see that happening anytime soon.Don't hold your breath about it being fixed tomorrow. And where will you move when you're homeless?Anyway . . . come and enjoy. It's still an interesting and beautiful city despite problems in some areas which I think have been exaggerated to some degree. No reason to worry unnecessarily since you'll probably have a good time and enjoy yourself just like most other people who have visited have had."
"Here is a report saying car break ins are down 17%..https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/San-Francisco-auto-break-ins-down-17-percent-as-12826910.phpI know people say this is an ""epidemic"" but I don't know anyone who has had a window smashed in years. The only one I recall is a co-worker who left a case visible that looked like a laptop (it held a folded blanket)."
"The odds of having your car broken into are pretty low, but it doesn't hurt to know how to avoid making yourself a target. When I drive into SF, I'm more worried about getting a parking ticket than having my car broken into.Edited: 2 years ago "
">>it sounds like it’s a lot worse there.<<Yes, it may be more likely in SF, but since I follow the same precautions everywhere, it really doesn't matter in terms of what I do.I wouldn't be comfortable leaving the car unlocked, but I have heard of people who do (putting up a sign -- ""no valuables, car unlocked""). I seem to remember something about your insurance not covering you if the car isn't locked and it's stolen, but that may be an urban legend."
Chances are your car will be fine but it is a PITA if it happens to you. My car has not been hit in SF. I visit often. But family who live in SF have had break ins to their cars in the last 10 years in the Portola and Richmond neighborhoods. These are not fancy cars either.
"San Fran has turned into a cesspool. I don't even drive there anymore, and since their public transportation is little more than homeless camps on wheels, I don't use that either, which means I rarely go to DR. WIN WIN"
