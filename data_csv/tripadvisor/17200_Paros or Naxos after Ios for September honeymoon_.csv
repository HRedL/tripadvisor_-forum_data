"We're doing a 11-day honeymoon starting with two nights in Santorini (simply because it had a really cheap/easy flight from NYC where we live -- we're a bit worried about how crowded/touristy it's supposed to be, so that's why we are not spending long). We'll decompress at a luxury cave hotel there and then move along. We are then planning to spend Thurs September 17 to Sat Sept 21 in Ios at the Hide Out Suites in Mylopotas. We plan to do some hiking, check out churches, enjoy a boat tour, and take in whatever nightlife is still going at that point.We are ending the trip with a night or two in Athens, so it makes sense to do Paros or Naxos next as they have airports. I'm having a hard time deciding between the two, as people seem to be very fond of both. I figured the Ios forum could offer a neutral recommendation about which would pair best with our itinerary and timeframe. Other relevant bits: we're both 30 years old and relatively active (we enjoy a bit of laying on the beach, but not more than a half day) -- we're looking for a mix of nightlife, outdoor activities, history, local culture, and good food. As it's our honeymoon, budget is less of a big concern.Edited: 8:35 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Bravo, we are delighted!And now, do you have any specific question or you just wanted to brag about journey that will be difficult to accomplish before 2021. ?"
Don't book anything yet - nobody knows how long we're all on lockdown. Fine planning of course.
"Yeah, I’m being optimistic obviously and trying to distract myself from the mounting catastrophe around us by doing some planning while stuck in our tiny studio apartment. But thanks for being kind of a jerk about it poster #1!"
"I think you should plan this even if it slips to 2021. But it might be later this year. I take it the shut down in New York is like California? Although it's the same most places in the world now. My brother tells me they are expecting a lot of fatalities in CA. We will here in the UK. The very optimistic figure is 20k but it could be 250k or higher :-(I cannot comment on any parts of your trip apart from Athens. It is great and being in or near Plaka is a must. We did one night in late January before coming back for 3 more nights in February after going to the Peloponnese. We scratched the surface in Athens and will be back.On the Sunday when we got back to Athens (1st Feb) it was so busy. I cannot imagine it so quiet now.Happy planning. And maybe your plans can happen in 2020.Edited: 10:22 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Yeah, in New York we’re on full lockdown and the hospitals are starting to overload. It’s really scary and sad. Thanks for the Athens tip, and hope you are safe and well in the UK!Edited: 11:08 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"At the moment not even Greeks are allowed to travel to the islands unless they are permanent residents of that island. This seems to be keeping most islands free of the virus at the moment, but that could change when visitors are allowed again. Few islands have medical facilities that can cope with an epidemic. I will be staying at home this year."
"Yeah, it makes sense. I wouldn't travel during an epidemic -- it's my hope that in six months the situation will be better."
"With regard to your original question and fervently hoping things have improved by September, either island would be fine. I have visited both many times and they have nice towns, good beaches and interesting interiors. Naxos is larger so consequently has a bit more in the way of interior and the highest mountain in the Cyclades. The way I would approach it is to check which is easier to get to from Ios on the day you wish to travel and then which has the best/cheapest/most convenient flight back to Athens. Theoretically, both islands should still have regular daily connections with Ios in late September. A good source of ferry information is www.gtp.gr.Once you are able to work out the logistics, then the exciting bit of finding somewhere to stay can begin. As has already been mentioned, this year may be a write off but a lot of the fun in a holiday is the planning. Finally, many congratulations on your marriage, I hope you are able to enjoy your honeymoon in Greece"
"Thanks, Richard! That's a really helpful answer -- if both islands are great, it makes sense to go with whichever one has the most convenient transportation. I had asked originally because I couldn't tell if there was a big difference relative to Ios, but sounds like I can't go wrong either way (assuming of course that we're even able to have a wedding or honeymoon).Hope everybody is safe and we'll get through this soon!Edited: 8:30 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Either Paros or Naxos would be a good choice. Naxos has a larger interior with more traditional mountain villages, and Paros has more seaside villages around the entire perimeter of the island. Most tourist infrastructure of Naxos is in the southwest corner around Naxos town. I stay on Antiparos, which is a small island separated from Paros by a one mile strait with frequent local ferries between the two. Paros and Naxos both have small airports with service to Athens by turboprops. Paros has a longer runway, so is able to handle larger aircraft."
"Have you thought about using the ferry as an option rather than plane. It is a little longer but it's much more relaxing.Also last summer I got the ferry from Paros to Naxos for just 11 euros. Naxos is Ios was 32 euros. Paros and Naxos will be nice and peaceful after Santorini and definitely have the best beaches and Ios is your place for nighlife, but still offers great beaches too.I've just done a new post on my blog on my favourite beaches and Naxos and Paros come up in this. https:/… I hope you manage to go this year!"
