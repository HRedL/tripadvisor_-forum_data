"Polar related, forgive me that it is not explicitly Antarctic related. I see that Trudeau has banned all ships in the canadian arctic, regardless of size, for the whole summer season.https:/…https:/…1_4852002.htmlWith this, and the mandatory self quarantine for air travelers arriving in Argentina from some countries, these are unique times we are living in for sure."
Wow. I hope this doesn’t spread to the European Arctic. I’m still crossing my fingers that our August Arctic trip can some how still happen.
Me too ShazDwn (Greenland/Iceland in August) but I'm getting less hopeful by the day. But if a missed vacation is the only consequence of the epidemic for me I will consider myself lucky. Stay safe everyone.
Thanks for sharing. It sounds like they won't allow ships carrying more than 500 people to dock. Maybe they will allow the smaller expedition ships …

Shaz and Soph - me too. We have a Russian arctic trip in July. We can have our own little support group here ☺️
With large cruise ships stopping operations for 30-50 days I hope we do enough to slow it down. Fingers crossed smaller companies are able to survive those tough months - the question will be when travel restrictions („travel ban“) will be lifted. China is still in place even with less then 30 new cases per day.Personal I can‘t see any long time travel planning going ahead for 2020 - but hope that I‘m wrong
"A different source:""No cruise ships will be allowed to make any stops in the Canadian Arctic either for the entire season “given the limited public health capacity in Canada’s Northern communities,” Transport Canada added in a press release.""https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/federal…"
"Posted this in the cancellatons thread, but reposting here:THis is quark's updated policy.https:/…book-with-confidenceThey state that All arctic departures beginning May 1 are on schedule, which confuses me a bit given the canada ban."
I'm very sorry ShazDwn. Which company was it?
Oh no shaz. Are you going to postpone for the next year?
"Soph it was Aurora Expeditions. I totally understand the decision and they have offered to move our booking to 2021 or 2022 at no cost or to provide a credit for our deposit so I am ok with that. The world will still be there to see when all this is overEdited: 7:44 am, March 25, 2020 "
