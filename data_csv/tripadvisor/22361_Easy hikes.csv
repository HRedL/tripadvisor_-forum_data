"Emerald Lake is one of the shortest in the area. According to my hiking guide, McLeod Lake and TJ Lake are also short options although the descriptions indicate some steep bits. As I said on your other thread, the Little Lakes Basin is one of the ""hidden"" treasures of the Eastern Sierra."
"You can't get to Devil's Postpile this summer, they aren't running the shuttle."
"England79Would you mind giving us a brief outline of your trip?I think you are doing a loop from LA up along the eastern Sierras to Carmel.If you let us know how you are allocating time, we might be able to provide the best use of your time. You are also going to be very close to Yosemite, but you haven’t mentioned it as part of your trip, so I wonder what route you were planning to cross the Sierras"
"Leaving San Diego.. 2 nights in Lone Pine...2 nights in Mammoth...3 nights in Sonora, 3 nights in Pacific Grove,2 nights in Monterey, 1 night in Cambria, 1 night in Santa BarbaraThese are our thoughts. My husband is 85yrs is active, but walking a marathon may not work. We love scenic, drives, pretty towns, stopping for coffee etc.Thank you so much for your help"
"Thanks for the info.We’re you planning on staying in Sonora to visit Yosemite.? I ask because it’s more than 2 hours drive each way from Sonora to Yosemite Valley where most of the Yosemite sights are.I really, really, really think you should try to switch those 3 Sonora nights to Yosemite National Park."
We were thinking of going to Yosemite from Mammoth as the hotels in Yosemite are pretty expensive for our budget
"Mammoth is not the best place to stay to visit Yosemite National Park. Yosemite is a very large park and technically the park boundary may be only 45 minutes from Mammoth, but the classic and must-do parts of Yosemite are on the west side of the park, about a 3 hour drive each way from Mammoth, not 45 minute drive.There is plenty to do and see in the eastern Sierras from Mammoth, but it’s not at all a good base to visit the Yosemite Valley Floor sights.If you go to the Yosemite park section on TripAdvisor, there are some articles about where to stay on all sorts of budgets. You can do much much better than staying in Sonora. Please post a question on the Yosemite branch and mention you will be visiting in mid-September for very helpful information."
Thank youI will do that
"Convict Lake, just south of Mammoth Lakes is a beautiful Lake to hike around. You can park at one end and hike part way or all the way (about 3 miles) around it. Maybe enjoy that area in the drive from Lone Pine."
Please stay home and wear a mask. Coronavirus is real.
@spapIf you had actually read England79’s posts you would see these nice people are planning a trip for 3 months from now.It is not helpful to spam travel boards with your rude posts
"Thank you for your kind words.If there is any doubt about putting anyone at risk when September arrives, we will certainly cancel our trip. Just being hopeful"
