"As far as I know, everyone has to apply to leave at the moment, and then some people are granted exemption to leave. You can't just arrive at the airport and hope to get on a flight."
"You will need to apply for an exemption, it may not be a quick process even if you’re a genuine resident of another country. You’re an Australian citizen, that automatically makes you a resident in terms of these restrictions, whether or not you actually usually reside here."
"Thanks to All The confusing part is below in the link posted by Luigi .You are exempt if you are: ordinarily resident in a country other than Australiaan airline, maritime crew or associated safety workera New Zealand citizen holding a Special Category (subclass 444) visaengaged in the day-to-day conduct of outbound freightassociated with essential work at Australian offshore facilitiestravelling on official government business, including members of the Australian Defence Force.You are considered ordinarily resident in a country other than Australia if international movement records show that you’ve spent more time outside Australia than inside for the last 12 to 24 months. You do not need to carry a paper record of your movements with you. If required, Australian Border Force officers at airports can check your movement records in Departmental systems.If you have not spent more time outside Australia than inside for the last 12 to 24 months, but still consider yourself to be ordinarily resident in another country, you can submit a request for a travel exemption."
What you put on your immigration arrival form might be relevant too. Overall sounds like applying for an exemption would be safest.
">> The confusing part is below in the link posted by Luigi .You are exempt if you are:ordinarily resident in a country other than Australia <<What this means is that when you prove you are a resident of another country (with evidence of your job, your property ownership or lease of accomodation etc) you will be granted an exemption and then permitted to leave. If you just show up at the airport you won’t be getting on a plane."
"I don't understand why one needs permission to leave! Enter, yes, but what consequences are there for a departing citizen? Is it because then they might return, bringing the virus with them?"
"I think it’s because Australian citizens have the right to return still, so they’re wanting to reduce the chance of people popping back and forth constantly."
"Ah, yes. But those wanting to go home like the OP could be exempt if they can prove 'home' is no longer Australia...."
"""But those wanting to go home like the OP could be exempt if they can prove 'home' is no longer Australia....""Yes, but it might be difficult to prove that home is no longer Australia when you came back in middle of a pandemic presumably claiming that Australia is home.Bigozzi, just curious, why did you come back in May when Australia is no longer home?"
"My Sister in law, Australian citizen, resident of the UK, recently returned from Australia to the UK.I'm not entirely sure what the process was but as she was able to illustrate UK residence it was quite straightforward. She returned in late July."
"My sister got an exemption approved couple weeks ago.She was desperate to go to Croatia, as she does every year for 5 months. Apparently, she had to pay $3000 non-refundable deposit. That changed her mind and she is happy to wait until she doesn't have to pay a non-refundable deposit.Edited: 5:52 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"It may be media beat up but there have been numerous reports of people making multiple trips back and forth and using the quarantine facilities each time. Now it’s pay your own way and the cap on returning numbers they may start being more lenient on the people wanting to leave, as coming back is now much harder and not so much a drain on the government."
"To make it even less drain on the government (taxpayer) and discourage people going overseas, they should charge a true cost of quarantine, not just $3000."
"A few media stories around this weekend on coming back to Australia and permission to leave the country. Border Force says they have granted 23,000 residents permission to leave out of total 92,000 applications.https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-re…"
Another story here suggesting applicants have been receiving automatic denials:https:/…
"Luigi I believe a special plane was put on for a load of Kiwis to be returned to NZ. In that case, as they all had been in Her Majesty's Accommodation for quite a while, their exemptions were granted quickly, probably with the provision that they never darken our shores again."
