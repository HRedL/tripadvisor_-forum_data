"I will be driving from miami to Gatlinburn, what is the situation in Tennesse with the Coronavirus? still safe to do that trip on two weeks?"
I think you will be fine. As far as I know there is only one case in TN. Just do what you do now to protect yourself. Wash your hands often. Cover your mouth if you cough or sneeze.I wouldn't cancel unless it just got real bad.
"Rented a cabin from American Patriot Getaways for April 4 for 5 days. Did not get insurance. With out Ins they say no refund, no exceptions. I would think The coronavirus would be an exception."
"I just returned this evening from a weekend stay with my family. No one there is losing their minds over it. Just use common sense and wash your hands often, We had a great trip with many thousands of other people and are going back on the 28th for another weekend trip."
"Here are the recently published CDC advisory on travel, and especial”y air travel: https:/…travel-in-the-us.htmlHunt"
"We have the same problem. Rented a cabin for March 22nd -28th and no refund if we don't show up. Kind of playing it by ear for now.Edited: 11:52 am, March 16, 2020 "
"it's safe. you'll be driving in a car to a cabin. it's the best social distancing vacation out there. also, there are no cases in Gatlinburg or Sevier County at present. The closest case is 2 hours away."
"There is now a case in Sevier county. I would stay as far as possible from the tourist areas.Edited: 10:53 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"As of today, there are 9 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sevier County. There are significantly more in some of the surrounding counties. There is a state order to stay at home and the mayors of Gatlinburg, Sevierville and Pigeon Forge have written a commentary to vacation rentals to cease advertising their properties as a means of safe social distancing. Keep in mind, an estimated of up to 25% persons infected are not symptomatic and CDC estimates that the virus can remain in the air for up to 3 hours. It is your decision whether you come here, but keep in mind that you will potentially interact with someone that has come here from a hotbed and if you do contract the virus, you might take it back to your community."
Tennessee is tightening their restrictions and the state should do that.Why travel at this time and take a chance of getting sick or making someone sick.I think you would be more comfortable at home.
Tennessee’s virus cases are rising rapidly as of 7-13-2020
