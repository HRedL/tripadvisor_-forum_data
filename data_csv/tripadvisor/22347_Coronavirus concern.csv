"Anyone traveling to DR concern about Coronavirus? We are traveling there in a week with small kids and wondering if we should postpone our plans. So far, no cases are reported but it’s getting a bit uneasy to travel overseas with this thing around. Anyone else in the same boat?"
"""Anyone else in the same boat?""Kinda, sorta. I'm scheduled for travel to the DR in a few months and will be travelling to another destination in about six weeks.I'm monitoring the situation, of course, but at this point, there is absolutely nothing that would make me cancel my travel plans to the DR or elsewhere in the Caribbean. YMMV. A colleague of my husband's recently cancelled, at VERY significant expense, an extended trip to Europe that was planned for May. Both my husband and I think this guy is nuts/paranoid but that's really not fair as this sort of thing comes down to (1) a person's own personal risk tolerance and (2) that person's own perception of the risk. The fact that *I* think the risk is minimal - at least, not significantly greater than staying at home - is not relevant. Good luck with whatever you decide."
There have been zero cases in the Dominican Republic or even in the Caribbean so far. The only countries with any cases are the US and Canada in North America so I would not be concerned about this if you have recent travel plans.
wildcat... there have been at least 2 identified cases coming out of Cuba and Jamaica (Caribbean) :-)
"As of this morning, the CDC has reported 53 potential cases of Coronavirus in the US. They also reported 175,000 cases of influenza so far this season with 15,000 active cases right now. As mentioned before, neither the CDC or World Health Organization has reported any cases in the Caribbean or Mexico. Not sure getting the Coronavirus is something I’d be worrying about here or in the DR."
"Zero cases in the DR, many in Canada. Time to move."
We are traveling March 3 to the 12th. At this time we have absolutely no concerns. That being said-if you feel sick please stay home and see a Dr.!
"debinatore You are incorrect there have been zero cases in The Dominican Republic, and none in either Jamaica or Cuba. There was someone tested in Jamaica and the test came back negative."
agree with # 7 No cases in Jamaica at all!!! false information
"Actually, our trip is booked for October. Thus far, there are no DX'ed cases of Corona Virus, but who knows what the future holds...Cruise ships will be anchoring off of Marina Cap Cana and its travelers will be tendered to Marina Cap Cana by boat.Amber Cove, near Puerta Plata, I believe, will welcome visitors soon. Interestingly, Carnival Corp owns it. Carnival Corp owns that lovely floating petry dish disaster docked outside of Japapn.We booked a trip to MX when the Swine Flu was a whisper. When our time came, we threw caution to the wind and continued on with our plans.We are older, wiser and have weaker immune systems. We are keeping a close eye on this fast-spreading virus. I am hoping I don't have to use our trip/travel insurance in our combined 50+ yeas of travel.Let's all keep our fingers crossed and pray to our God of choice."
"Wildcat, I NEVER said there were any cases in the Dominican Republic AND I never said there were cases IN Cuba or Jamaica !!!! As for the latter, I meant to say 2 Canadian returning from Cuba and Jamaica were tested for the virus."
"This Coronavirus is being spread so quickly. It is a huge concern for travelers. I am very concerned with it. We are arriving this weekend in the D.R. We are not going to cancel our trip due to this virus, but we are going to be as vigilant as we can. My family will wipe down the airplane trays, seat belts & arm rests with disinfecting wipes. Also, using hand sanitizer before eating or drinking anything, both on the plane or while in the resort."
"I wish everyone would do that, no matter of coronavirus or not... people leave their nasty germs every where."
"^^^^@ Debinatore - I wish this too. Just the other day, a poster (possibly on a different forum) mentioned that their 18 month old had a cold but they would be travelling the following day anyway. Ugh.On the other hand, travel isn't cheap and even ""cancel-for-any-reason"" insurance leaves you out of pocket (the insurance premium isn't refunded), so I can certainly understand not wanting to cancel under such circumstances."
"Yes, I read that too,,, baby had a cold and travelling to PUJ the next day and wanted the VIP service... I restrained myself from commenting on her post :-)"

"@ Deb...Re Germs....Been using my OCD bag for years, even in my own country...ok, even when I dine out in my city. ; )"
@ PFP... me too :-) I don't care how much anyone stares at me... I just offer them some wipes LOL
"Deb...So, I am not the only one who gets the stares. lol"
"I haven't noticed any stares, but nor do I care. I have been making my family use hand sanitizer at all restaurants that we go to for years. They used to roll their eyes at me, but now they are starting to understand why I do it. Once we get seated and look at the menu, out comes the hand sanitzer. The menus are not wiped down after each guest, so who knows what germs are lurking on them. Same goes for the airplane. Wipe everything down!"
I’m leaving in October don’t think I’m worried about is the airport in New York City so I will wear a mask to the airport and after I get on the plane I take it off and will be a great trip for two weeks.
These posts are making me feel that l live recklessly when it comes to germs. I use the sanitizer at the resort restaurants but I believe using it all the time reduces your resistance to germs. Maybe I’m just lucky that I rarely get ill.
"I wipe down my seating area on the plane as I know they don't clean them in between flights, people are pigs, pick their nose, flick their boogers, change babies on the seats and trays.... yadda, yadda, yadda"
"I found a disinfectant spray that can be sprayed on surfaces and it lasts 24 hrs. It won't help those of us who are germ proactive on an airplane, but it can be packed in checked luggage to do your room. It is called Microban. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200…This version is newer. There is some serious price gouging going on. Many sites are also sold out. I managed to purchase 2 spray cans from a Medical Supply company. Also, masks are not effective. The most effective is N95 Mask and it expensiveHope this helps fellow germ phobes."
Bravo! The DR will not allow a cruise ship to dock: https:/…That is a step in the right direction.
The President of DR has ordered emergency provisions for prevention. YES THIS ARTICLE IS IN ENGLISHhttps:/…
1 person now has it. Just heard today. We are due to go there next week but now thinking of cancelling as don't want to end up spending our holiday in quarantine.
AlisonNo one in Punta Cana has the coronavirus the Italian tourist was staying at the Viva Wyndham Dominicus Beach hotel in Bayhibe.Where are you staying ?Angie.
"I am traveling to Punta Cana the last week of March. I don't fall into high risk group (age or pre-existing conditions) and I doing my best washing hands and sanitizing my office desk and door handles - taking common sense preventive actions.I am concerned picking up the virus on the plane though - with the air re-circulation etc. I got terrible flu in December flying from EU. The biggest fears I have for this trip are - not getting appropriate treatment in DR and that i might get into quarantine either in DR or on my arrival to Boston.I am taking my work with me in case if I am stuck in paradise. I am a bit upset though by the fact that travel insurance doesn't have coverage for the pandemic...And I am also p-sed at my travel agency that has NO information or guidance on their website on what they and I can do to minimize the risk and financial loss, In the world that you cannot find a corner where you don't hear about the virus this silence is quite strange. And probably irresponsible. It's too bad when some of us have to chose between the money and wellbeing. Money money money money ... my favorite scene in the Cabaret with Liza Minnelli."
My son and I are going in May - I saw this website posted by property owners there - https:/…

I am also a property owner here and a business owner...I do not direct to my website for updates. I would suggest you simply follow www.dominicantoday.com. Or DR1.com ....for up to date info.

"there has been 1 Italian tourist who is quarantined at a military hospital. He was never in Punta Cana and didn't fly into the airport in Punta Cana but traveled to another area of the DR. Agreed Evtcolon, despite this thread title no one in Punta Cana has tested positive for the coronavirus only 1 person in the DR has who was in another area of the DR.They also tested 2 French tourist but both test came back negative for the coronavirus. They have also tested all of the Italian man's family who traveled with him and they also have come back negative for the virus as well. Here is the link.https:/…"
"We just got back from the trip to Punta Cana with young children. I started this thread where we weren’t even sure few hours before the trip and were in dilemma if we should make a trip or not. We finally decided to make a trip considering that there were no reports having anyone infected in DR let alone punta Cana. We prepared ourselves with disinfected wipes, hand sanitizer, minimum hand luggage so that we can manage to sanitize kids and ourselves as much as possible. I’m glad we did the trip as planned. We came across number of families with small kids and resort we stayed at very high occupancy rate from USA and Canadian tourists mainly. Obviously, everyone who were there had a risk tolerance to our level where they decided to make a trip as well. Overall, we didn’t see people panicked at the airport in US or at punta Cana. Things seemed quite normal with very few of them having masks on. Everyone has different risk tolerance and personal situation to calculate after this threat but we are glad that we made this trip and didn’t cancel because of corona virus threat"
It's so nice when people take the time to come back to threads they started and give us an update.Glad you enjoyed your trip!
"Hello, no cases reported in Punta Cana."
Really looking forward to our 21 night trip in a few weeks time as we now have 116 confirmed cases here in the UK

Just don't drink Mexican beer
The reason they were in Ukraine was for quarantine. The Ukraine government was helping out the Dominican government when they started taking out their people from China. They are heading back to DR because they tested negative and are good to go back..
I am monitoring the situation closely to make sure my trip to the DR is still able to be done safely. I am still looking forward to my trip and hoping the airline does not cancel on me because of the virus. My limo service has sent me a message of upcoming changes in service so I think they are taking the right precaution that we all can at this point.
'Really looking forward to our 21 night trip in a few weeks time as we now have 116 confirmed cases here in the UK'No. You have 209. You have doubled in a day and a half.

"Rjharrison86: that is a decision you are the one to make. Everyone has his own tolerance level and personal situation. I am retired and have been travelling for over thirty years booked to leave in two weeks to DR. I feel safer staying home and that what I most likely will do. I will loose big amount because insurance company will not make a payout in this situation. But that is the price I am willing to pay for my comfort. At home I can stay put, limit my contacts take control of my situation to a large extend. I can only imagine what it is like if I am at the resort sitting in a dinning room with hundreds of people, coming from everywhere touching all the utensils that everybody is touching, talking to others while standing 3 feet apart. First question: where are you from, if from one of those infected counteries, the conversation will be too short, then I go to my room drench myself with hand sanitizer, perhaps take a hot shower just in case. Each sneeze is watched carefully by everyone. My imagination could run further to what could happen if I am forced to stay in my own room, stay in a HOSPITAL IN DR, OR IN MI LITERARY QUARANTINE. On the other hand people who are there now are reporting that they are enjoying their vacation very much and there are no issues that make them worried. There are two other threads on tripadvisor that you can read thru them and make your mind. All the best on whatever decision you make and I hope my response doesn't scare you from going if that is your decision. I am only venting my personal feeling and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The other two threads are:https:/…105915619https:/…105930564"
"#55. Thanks a lot. Have their location been disclosed? Santo Domingo, Punta Cana or anywhere else?If 2 of them are hiding (based on #56), they now can be anywhere in the island I guess."
debinatore Please post a link to the article that details these 3 latest people. I can not find anything on them.
It’s at 7 now and 1 recovered so total is 6 active
What is at 7. There are only 2 confirmed cases of COVID19 and both were from the same resort in another area of the DR both from the same resort one was an Italian tourist the other a elderly Canadian.

"As I understand it - 2 confirmed cases and 5 in quarantine. This from Dominican Today website: Santo Domingo.- The 21st Century Medical Center revealed Mon. that the five health professionals who had contact with the woman from Villa Riva (NW) who tested positive for the coronavirus are in quarantine.Spokeswoman Dr. Isabel Ramirez said that those people are in their homes without presenting symptoms of the virus thus far.She added that Oraida Herrera Díaz was in isolation because she arrived at the health center with flu-like symptoms that had epidemiological links of the coronavirus, “so the Public Health Ministry proceeded to test her for the coronavirus.”"

It is not really even 6 active cases its only 1 case if 1 has recovered. These 5 health care workers are being quarantined because they had contact with the person who had it when they provided medical attention not because they actually tested positive for the virus themselves.

I am due to travel from UK on 16th April … feeling somewhat apprehensive to say the least.
"I am due to go on the 23rd to RIU Republica, Punta Cana for a week. Not sure what to do now, debating if I should cancel or not. If cancel will I be able to postpone to latter date or get some of my money back. I am traveling with SUNWING from Montreal."
Unless you purchased cancel for any reason insurance at the time of your booking. You will either be going or lose your money.
"Sunwing is offering nothing at the moment unless you purchased the No Worry Cancel for Any Reason insurance.PS. Sunwing has not dropped their prices one single penny since the start of this, they have raised them."
"I'm traveling to La Romana on Thursday for a 5 night trip with my 16 year old daughter. I wasn't that nervous until someone mentioned to me that the hotel we are staying at (Casa De Campo) could have a lot of international guests staying there and that started to make me worry. Now I'm wondering if Italians could be leaving their country and escaping to the Caribbean, rather than quarantining...but I'm sure this is my imagination running wild."
I believe they have stopped all flights from Italy to Dominican since they first diagnosed the case of an Italian man
"Just my experience cancelling my trip to Punta Cana. I am not encouraging you to cancel your trip. Everybody has different levels of tolerance. I booked my all-inclusive package through Costco Canada. I cancelled my trip 6 days before the due date. I was only charged $15/person for the flight. I got full refund of the hotel. We have 4 people. So, I was charged $60. The refund went back to my account the next day of my call. I am pretty satisfied with their service.I heard a lot of travel companies allow you to keep the credit if you cancel this time. I am not sure if this is correct or not."
Your imagination is running wild. Casa de Campo is more of a long term residential area than a short term vacation location. It is made up primarily of Dominican and South American families with some other internationals as well.
"We are travelling from Gatwick next month on the 15th, mine and my partners first holiday together! Just remember in the UK everything is ATOL protected, I am mildly worried as you are but to be honest it’s a case of what will be will be, out of any of our control.I’m not someone who lives in fear though, so I plan to travel unless cancelled by the tour operator."
24andyxzLike you we are from the UK and will be travelling out on the 9th April and have no intentions of cancelling unless we are forced toLots of things can and will happen in the next few weeks
"This is correct. We were scheduled to leave from Michigan to Punta Cana on April 1st, 2020 for a week (wife, 2 children and I). I was offered the possibility to cancel the trip for a full credit, that I can use until 12/31/2020 to any destination. We decided to cancel...Edited: 2:15 pm, March 10, 2020 "
We’re in the same situation. Leaving Monday on the 16th and debating to cancel with Sunwing or not!I asked one of their agents yesterday if there were any people cancelling and they said all was normal but I think they are told to say this.
Yes same here! Leaving Monday on 16th out of YEG.Debating on what to do!
Carl no one can really tell you what to do but there are still no reported cases in Punta Cana.
"We are scheduled to leave on April 17th for 10 days. We are planning on going unless things take a drastic turn for the worse, either here in TO or in PC. What a shame for travellers as well as the resort destinations."
Vlynson you are correct the DR is not allowing more flights from Italy at this time based on what I saw as well.
"Just my personal opinion but I don’t see why anyone would cancel right now, if the situation gets a lot worse then yes but as there is no issues in PC right now it seems a bit OTT to cancel a trip leaving in a few days.You’re probably safer in PC right now than most places in the world.Edited: 6:17 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"traveling_wildcat123,Is there a website or somewhere that I can check what countries DR is not letting in? Thank you :)"
"24andyxz: How much do you trust the official figures coming out of some countries. Example Egypt with population of over 100 Million reporting 59 cases. while Italy just across the Mediterranean and population of about 60 million reporting 10,149. Perhaps many existing cases are undetected all over and every where?"
We got 2 more people who tested positive for the Corona virus in Quebec .One that just came back from a vacation in DR and another one they just said was in the Caribbean and Miami .
Where did you see this Gat0? Update as of an hour ago had no confirmation as to where new cases were infected.https:/…covid-wed-update-1.5493439
"This one notes: ""..The latest cases involve one individual who returned from the Caribbean and Miami and another who returned from the Dominican Republic.""https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/…but of course, where in Dominican, we won't know."
Thanks for the update Enis.
"I would be very doubtful about the Egypt cases. We had a museum in Houston sponsor a trip and 17 people from Houston went on a Nile River cruise and 12 came back with the coronavirus so Egypt probably has higher numbers than that we now have 14 cases and nearly all of the Texas cases are tied to this Egyptian cruise.As far as Punta Cana they have zero cases still and resorts are being vigilant.Edited: 11:51 am, March 11, 2020 "
"If that Montrealer diagnosed (recently travelled to the DR) is confirmed as infected while in the DR, guess would be that he likely was in same location as those infected here otherwise if from another location then that would not be good news. Still possibility that he wasn't infected in the DR even if he travelled here. Of note, the traveller returning from the DR is at home in self-isolation."
AL_0427 I have not seen a comprehensive list on places they are not allowing flights from obviously they have denied cruise ships from docking if they had sick passengers. Chinese tourist are not being allowed in the country and they cancelled all flights from Italy so the country is being vigilant in trying to limit the spread of the virus to their country and tourism industry. Anyone who appears sick or is running a high temperature is being stopped at the airport as well for possible quarantine.Slyguy I know that the Canadian was also staying at the Viva resort in Bayahibe with where the French guy was quarantined again this was not in Punta Cana.
"Thanks TW, was looking to see where he had been. Good news (in a sense) I guess. Now let's see if others will have returned home from there without any symptoms initially but having been infected.Edited: 12:21 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"here is some food for thought :Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabledwhere is the media hysteria on these numbers"
"Sly, I think I'm reading that news link the same as you? They didn't say two NEW cases, I think they were saying one of the older cases was from the D.R. and I'm thinking that's the Viva resort in La Romana?The news just now said 2 more cases but one had travelled and the other was community spread (that part isn't good).Still selfishly keeping fingers crossed for Sask and MB"
"At this point, my wife, kids, and I are assuming that universal exposure to the corona virus is a fait accompli. Doesn’t matter if you’re home or in the DR.My wife and daughter are still going end of this week. Might leave a day early, in fact."
"Deb not sure but did sound like the laest (2 new cases include the one that returned from the DR). Have not seen where it says that he was at the same resort as the other cases as pointed out in 99 though.""Two more cases in QuebecQuebec’s Health Ministry confirmed late Tuesday that two more cases of COVID-19 have been detected in the province, bringing the total number of cases identified thus far to seven.The latest cases involve one individual who returned from the Caribbean and Miami and another who returned from the Dominican Republic"""
"I am planning to book my trip from Washington DC to Santo Domingo for April 10-13 (Semana Santa weekend). Not sure if I should postpone this trip due to Coronavirus concern! Any thoughts?Edited: 4:14 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Any thoughts? I would just research, read what you can, listen to the experts (not people on facebook or tripadvisor) and use your own risk factor to make your decision.Me, I am keeping my fingers crossed that my upcoming trip won't be cancelled.I am more concerned with americans bringing it into other countries as they seem to be having a growing number of affected persons :-(I wish the airports would at least be using that non-invasive head thermometer on people."
First case in Ottawa. Someone who travelled to Florida. More case here than PC now.
What questions are being asked at the airport upon arrival?
as far as people here have reported.... none :-(
Wasn'y it Austria?
Folks likely won't self declare on arrival anywhere so asking questions do not help unless you are arriving from a flagged location.
"Sorry, I mean wasn't the first case in Ottawa someone who had returned from Austria?"
Heard from Florida this afternoon. Looking for confirmation.
My apologies. Heard Florida on the radio. It is Austria. https:/…56793c0b-ad0a-4316-a0c5-003b257c310d
"yes,.. Me too I am more concerned with Americans bringing it into other countries, especially from what I heard today from the news. It appear that The US gouv a little slow on this; together with their health system I think this could become very dangerous. I am going to adult only resort on the 23rd for a week and there will be a lot of American there."
Wr are leaving Sunday March 15 th anyone there now? How is it?
"As my work is flexible I’m wondering about potentially bringing my trip to DR forward, we are due to go in mid April which here in the UK is predicted to be a ‘peak’ of the virus.We are travelling with TUI who I’m pretty sure will not cancel unless they are physically forced too by the government because financially it would absolutely cripple them I would imagine. I’m not really a worrier but having looked forward to this holiday for so long I’m beginning to become a little twitchy I can’t lie."
how was your trip to DR? I'm departing on Mar 24 and want to get some insight into what it's like down there with the Coronavirus concern? I don't want to go away on vacation and not have a good time.. ;-)
"24andy... same here, Sunwing, like most others will fly til the gov't says they can't. travelagent... wait, just typed out your name and it says you're a travel agent LOL... do you not have any clients there right now? Most of the facebook pages say everyone's having a good time and no virus concerns."
Can you let us know if you have any issues getting back into the US or what they are doing once you get back here? We are supposed to leave on Monday and concern is getting back in!
"You go ahead mate. Us Brits are generally resilient (despite over reaction, hoarding and emptying supermarkets etc.). A fair bit of over reaction I'd say...We are going on the 10th April and will NEVER consider cancelling or altering our plans ourselves.Stiff upper lip - 2 world wars and a World Cup etc."
"Yes there have been confirmed cases in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The US has a lot of cases. In Nova Scotia today we have no cases, but it was just announced that any public servants travelling internationally must self isolate for 14 days."
"<< “ We are going on the 10th April and will NEVER consider cancelling or altering our plans ourselves.” >>So, over the course of the next four weeks, you will not continue to monitor the situation to ensure that your decision is sound?That’s not resilient. That’s irrational.Edited: 10:20 am, March 13, 2020 "
Here is possibly some good news on fighting this virus.https://ca.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-covid1…
Just want to update. My trip with sunwing can be re-book. They will give us voucher which can be used for 1 year since the voucher being issued.

"We are currently staying at the Melia resort in Punta Cana.The only thing that has changed since we have been here is that hand sanitizer is available at the entrance to each restaurant. Nobody is panicking, the weather is wonderful and life goes on.People are talking about flights home etc but until a travel advisory is put into place there’s not much you can do. Our major concern has been what restaurant to eat in tonight...."
peter...such a great attitude.
"<< “ Also, carry antibacterial wipes (if you can find any), antibacterial gel, ” >>Just keep in mind when looking for these things that “antibacterial” isn’t the same as “anti-viral.”You need to make sure whatever you’re getting/using is effective against against coronavirus... not just bacteria."
<< “I did read that DR did allow 30 Chinese folks into DR...” >>Would be great if people posted links when making statements like this. Lots of people claim “they heard” or “just read” stuff that just isn’t true.

<< “ Those who are interested in the detail may follow this link:” >>Yes. With corona and everything going on in the world... people are interested in the details about some things stolen from your luggage .SMH
"RJP-MJ: The issue is not the stolen items as such but the risk tourists are exposed to if in a secured area of the airport and all the security cameras, someone open your locked luggage take whatever he wishes and walk away with it. That person and whoever cover up for him is capable of doing much more harm. Perhaps using you as a mule for drug trafficking. Try to convence your custom officer in your own that you are innocent. This also about anexample of trusting the authority reporting cases of Corona virus."
discover12 happens in canadian airports also https:/…you need to come to terms you dont know where it happened
"northern-ale-2001: Thanks for the link. Completely different situation, one from cargo area, likely cargo airplanes. not to minimize the seriousness, the other one is in the secure area where passenger luggage is loaded to airplanes that carry thousands of passengers. Cannot imagine the harm if that thieve and those covering up for him are compromised by terrorist organization. As far as where it happened logic tells me that very very very unlikely this can happen at Ottawa airport unloading hundreds of suitcases in the half an hour or so, while passengers are anxiously waiting for their luggage."
google it there is many cases in toronto and yes that of items being directly taken from personal luggageagain you need to come to terms that you dont know for certain where items went missing
"Can we PLEASE not rehash the whole luggage theft issue again here? Go back to that thread if you want to go ""off topic"" of this thread.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g147293-i28-k13249…"
"People lose/have luggage stolen all over world airports, to say don’t trust the DR because of that is downright strange quite honestly.Back OT, We are due to fly in on the 15th of April from London but we have the option of moving the booking till the last week of this month as I’m almost certain now given the way things are moving here in the UK that either DR will ban flights from the UK as they have Italy or UK could close borders"
24andyxz: Sorry this will be my last posting commenting on this subject. Sadly we are in an ara of normalizing dishonesty and mistrust.
"We are due to fly from uk with tui on 8th of april.. but tui updated info, saying all holidays to D.R are cancelled until 29th march and then will be looked at again. If we can travel we will still be going."
It’s difficult to see them opening back up to European flights when the situation is only going to get worse in the next weeks.
"Shazzer,The Dominican Government reported last night (Saturday 14th) that it suspended flights to and from Europe, South Korea and China, starting at 6:00 am on Monday for a month, due to the expansion of the coronavirus.That takes the date at present up until April 13th. that is without possible extensions.Angie."
"The issue is not getting the virus from places that don’t have any reported cases, it’s protecting the countries that don’t have any cases. St Maarten is closing incoming flights effective this Tuesday. I can see where it would be important for the countries that don’t have any cases to stay that way."
"<< ""I can see where it would be important for the countries that don’t have any cases to stay that way."" >>Hopefully they are not putting all their eggs in the ""expecting to stay that way"" basket. But rather they should have the objective of trying to delay and slow the inevitable uptake of the virus. For any country to expect to completely keep it at bay is a fool's errand at this point, and putting hopes solely against that, rather than a more realistic approach, is crazy."
WHY the heck are NO BRITS reporting the fact that ALL flights from the UK to Dom. Rep. are OFF and until further notice?It very simples peeps AND considerate!
"KLB... they are???? THere's just so many corona threads you just have to wade through them for the information.. Angie has been doing a great job trying to keep the Brits informed... plus, you can go to their websites or check your emails for updates."
"Restrictions on UK Flights is from the DR I believe. Agree Deb, so may threads now..."
"SlyFlights are suspended from the UK for 1 month, airlines and tour operators are currently reimbursing and refunding passengers their holiday and flight payments back onto their payment cards or they can rearrange their holidays to another date in the future. Angie."
"Thanks Angie. As per other thread, Canada set to impose more restrictions today. For those still intent on travelling, best to start looking into your options for cancelling or re-booking at a later date."
Many thanks indeed. You is correct too.
Great info. Angelina. Very grateful to you and really appreciate your excellent and unbiased input. Many thanks.The Dom.Rep. kid!
Domincan Republic all flights in and out cancelled due.to virus.
Sorry to say. But all flights to the domican repulica cancelled due to the virus.
Hi the dominican republic has cancelled all flights in and out due to the virus.
"OK David....Here I sit, not 2 miles from the airport, with pretty reliable sources within the system. As of the time that you have posted this, there is no word of ""all flights"" being canceled. Just those from Europe and the UK.Will this change? Yes, possibly. But at this time, you are spouting erroneous information...a dangerous and confusing thing to do.In respect, please edit your posts or have them removed, as they are not factual and are misleading."
"David B I'm sure you mean well... but please, we implore you to either post the link or at the very least copy the text here."
"I find that in the last few days, many of our UK friends (especially newbies) forget that this is a GLOBAL website. When they say ""ALL FLIGHTS"" they really mean ""ALL UK Flights.Funny... even most Americans aren't that self-absorbed. (Well... maybe Texans.)Their hearts are in the right place. Just wish their brains were as well.Edited: 10:56 am, March 16, 2020 "
"I wasn't able to log on during my trip so I can't remember which threads I was on - but we just got back yesterday from a 10 day trip to punta cana...All was well at the resort, we were extra diligent with sanitizing (i brought clorox wipes and a surface spray (the one that kills germs for 24 hours) and we tried to stay away from others as much as possible but you do end up in close proximity at the buffets....While we were gone - I got word that schools and both our jobs will be remote until at least the end of march...we were flying into Chicago on Sunday night and due to the horrific conditions at ohare on saturday night I was stressed out all sunday about being jammed into a 6 hour customs line with people from all over the world, in close proximity..... with 2 tired toddlers.luckily there was zero line - either at punta cana or at ohare when we arrived.no health checks of any kind, just a question of what other countries we visited in the last 30 days...we are back now and while I'm glad we went - it wasn't really a restful vacation... constant lookout for wiping stuff down, eyeballing my kids to try to keep their hands off of their faces and watching to see what surfaces they touched etc etc... every sneeze, cough, and person was suspect. It's just not a fun way to live but with elderly relatives and this thing popping up all over - it's hard to not worry. We are going to self quarantine for the most part - well everything's closed anyway - but we're staying away from all family/friends/public places apart from groceries for the next 2 weeks... at least... we'll see what the future holds.the best time was sitting on the breezy sunny beach far away from others - feeling pretty safe only at that point..."
The best of luck Gosia 4. Hope all is bug free.KLB.
"Gosia4: Very happy to hear that the vacation was fine, welcome back, hope all will be fine from here.All the bestEdited: 1:21 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Well it’s going to be easy now for those that are sitting on the fence. All Canadian Air operators are shutting down all flights south. Starting tomorrow planes will be dead heading south and bringing back their passengers before all operations south are shut down till mid April or they’ll see what happens then. Could be till end of summer!
Plus Dominican Republic to adopt more anti-crisis measures.Will await the see what president Danilo Medina has to say.https:/…Angie.
"Hi , my husband and I are supposed to be flying in to PC on Sunday the 22nd , any thoughts on that, is any resorts shut down yet? Restaurants?"
"I supposed to be flying there on March 21st from dc but we think we will cancel :( few resorts are closed, it might get worse any minute. I don’t want to find out on my second day that US is closing borders and have to rush to the airport to find any planeEdited: 3:41 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"<< ""my husband and I are supposed to be flying in to PC on Sunday the 22nd , any thoughts on that,"" >>Meaning... you're still on the fence about going?Assuming your cable TV and internet service is working, I won't jump on the bandwagon about curtailing virus spread, protecting yourself, protecting others, etc. That's apparently not working for a great many people. So be it.Instead, I'll appeal to baser instincts: You should cancel your trip now if you can. Why? Because -- forgetting that your trip will probably be cancelled by the governments of one or more countries -- your trip is going to suck. Really, really suck.Restaurants will be closed. Services will be curtailed. Wings/buildings at some resorts will be shuttered. Other resorts will be closed entirely with guests being moved/consolidated to sister properties. (Probably a property you looked at, but decided not to stay at.) Wherever you end up, the place will be a ghost town. You won't be able to buy/bring enough wipes to wipe down everything you're gonna touch. And, ultimately, you're going to spend every waking hour of your trip checking the internet for updates and worried the whole time about whether you'll be able to get home, and how, and when.That's not a vacation that I can see anyone being ""on the fence"" over.PS: for some context, my wife and daughter are on a flight home from the DR as I type this. They left Punta Cana this morning... returning earlier than planned. When they flew down last week things sort of seemed to be an “Oh, that’s an ‘Italy’ problem” curiosity thing to us. That changed quickly... seemingly between the time their flight boarded in Newark and the time it landed in the Caribbean.Less than one week ago we were on the fence about whether they should go or cancel. Since that time the world went from ""Ah... what the heck!"" to ""Yo... what the f**k!""Can't wait to see what NEXT week brings!"
"Stacy, Natalia: I cancelled my trip to DR that is leaving next week. I didn't cancel that decision would have been made for me. Our government is closing down all international flights except US. I posted this link on another forum and I am posting here so you see the seriousness that one infected tourist could cause among the hundreds of vacationers. This is a simulation of how the corona virus spreads.https:/…"
We are from Chicago as well and supposed to leave this Saturday. I feel like I will feel much safer there than here!! Ugh!! I have my Clorox wipes ready to go!! Can’t decide!!
"<< ""Can’t decide!!"" >>For the life of me, I can't imagine how this can be true.Please read my post #167Edited: 4:14 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Check the cheapcarribean.com website, they have listed all the resorts that are closing and I’m sure there will be more soon :( also, one terminal is already closed. I’m very sad but have decided not toGo. I don’t want to be in situation that they are placing me in a different hotel or the airport is closing and I have to leave immediately. Vacation would be full of stress :("
Trouble is TEX - YOU ain't got NO life!
"Planned to leave on March 21, but realized with the help of some of you that even if I had no problem getting there and out safely I’ll have no peace during my vacation. Constantly checking COVID-19 updates and counts, airlines cancellations, and worrying about the personal hygiene of ppl surrounding me or handling my food etc. will not help me to relax. And thanks to someone else in this chat I was able to see that several resorts in Bahia Principe were closed and the tourists were moved to the resort I booked. So, yesterday after one hour staying on hold I canceled my trip. Sad but there are worst things to live through. So thank you!"
"Just read this today, While some companies are taking advantage of the situation, that is what Sunwing is doing:Sunwing is offering available seats on its repatriation flights from southern destinations to stranded Canadians, free of charge – including for non-Sunwing customers, the company announced on Thursday (March 19th) “We understand a lot of Canadians are still stranded outside the country and struggling to get home,” said Stephen Hunter, CEO of Sunwing Travel Group. “That’s why we want to open up any extra capacity we have. It’s the Canadian thing to do.”"
