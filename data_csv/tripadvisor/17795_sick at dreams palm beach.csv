just back last night from a 4 day stay at dreams palm beach and lots of guests are sick
Could you qualify...LOTS...?????? How many is LOTS???1000?Just wondering!
"Hi Rush,Was just there myself this past week and didn't find that at all. Found good to great food and even dined with some of the guests that I met there a few times and they along with me were enjoying what was being served.Happy Travels!bb/mt"
is lots -2 or 200? I think anytime you travel to places unfamiliar someone will get sick. so a couple is ok but a whole resort full would be worriesome
"I always wonder how anybody actually knows that ""lots"" are sick?"
"The OP has given us nothing to go on yet. Don't be deterred from booking and don't be worried if you're traveling shortly. This thread is like a dive bomb where venom was planted without back story. Until he/she comes back with something viable to go on like symptoms, a bit of a story or an idea on the true number of sick, keep rushrush's comment in doubt. It's not to say that it wasn't indeed entirely true, but we have nothing to go on. When I've read this kind of very general comment before, there tends to be little consistency when they do provide more information. Like they know that ""lots of people were sick because nobody was at the pool all week"", yet 2 sentences later a problem with the hotel was that everywhere was so crowded.I'll wait for more.Kaki"
"I always wonder how many are alcohol induced sickness, not food related"
"I know everyone is always quick to jump on people who complain of food poisoning from a hotel. I do have to say, that of my many trips to the Caribbean and Mexico, I only got sick once. No one else in my family got sick. And I definately heard chatter around the pool about other people having sick family members who couldn't come out of the room that day. It wasn't an issue of too much sun, and it wasn't an issue of too much alcohol. It certainly made me never want to return to that resort, just as I'd not want to return to a restaurant in the states where I got sick, which has also happened only once. So, it's certainly possible. No reason to panic, of course, but no reason to dismiss it either."
thom1063......................Exactly................well said. Many drink and eat their fill during a short stay and with the sun and differant food thus the sickness.This is not to say some resorts at some time have problems and this may well have happened. But I still say a lot of these complaints are for the reasons stated.
"I have no issues with someone returning and saying they or companion were sick and give details as to how they were sick. But to say some, or I heard people were sick with out details is hogwash. Rather people stick to facts that are helpful for the rest of us."
"as BobNH says ""Many drink and eat their fill during a short stay and with the sun and different food thus the sickness.""I agree, but those that say that they never saw anyone sick or were never sick has no creedence, were you looking ? and even if the op has no back story,do they need to produce medical evidence.Basically every post is either one of two things...heresasy or yoursayithI do not like second hand information but when I saw six people last Thursday evening spewing their guts out in the airport departure area, I had to ask where they were and what their problem was....that is where I got the story of 38 of 42 hospitalized at a resort and another lady told me she was at, well you know where......and had been sick for 2 daysWhen 38 of 42 are treated for Giardiasis then there is a problem;Do travellers want to hear about it or do they want all the glossy skewed reports, we had a good time at what was a lower star resort (IMHO) than was advertised, nobody in our group was sick, one member broke her arm due to carelessness by her and the tram driver, should I diss the resort NO, should I run down the resort because I saw 2 rats NO but it was reported.I have been to PUJ 28 times and there is no resort that is perfect and glossy as many reports and reviews indicate, it just does not happen. A crystaline palace doesnt exist!mi dos peso's"
The great thing about TA is that we can all share our experiences.I shared mine and others theirs and then its up to the readers to read through and find what speaks to them.I guess its don't discount ALL negative or ALL positive posts get what you can that helps you.Happy Travels ALL!bb/mt
"so many guest are sick that they started walking around with hand cleaner and distribute it to everybody on the resort, they actually created a job out of it. Hector was telling me all this"
I did see the hand cleanser being offered at the restuarants and thought that was a nice touch.They even have it where I work in a major building in Baltimore at all the entrances in a little machine for those who want to use it.I even have it at my desk too.Seems that everyone is more aware now of how germs can spread from contact. I carry it with me all the time now. They have some lovely fragranced ones that I bought at Bath and Body Works in small bottles to gift while I was traveling and away to airline personal and resorts both as they come in contact with so many during their day.Happy Travels!bb/mt
thanks alot....you could have just got hector fired. do you NOT realize that the resorts management teams frequently READ these forums..\ps..i do not know hector nor do visit dreams resorts..just sayin..naming an employee was totally uncalled forlynn
by the way...in my restaurant..i have hand sanitizer by the front door..cash register...and in each washroom. it is called PREVENTATIVE MEDICINEoff soapbox now..sorry all
"when employees talk to you about a sickness problem, i think it is somewhat a little true"
It is True or it isn't Kindest regards ~ Leigh
"I believe the OP. I've run across a bad situation myself in the past. When I said something in the forum I was ganged up on by regulars to the area that refused to acknowledge there was a serious problem at the resort. I was told I was too fussy about the food, drank too much blah blah blah. I wish that were the only problem. There were over 30 out of a 100 people all ill at the same time. It was a nightmare for everyone including the poor medical staff. I have learned my lesson to read trip reports carefully. The odd report of illness I discount but when I read several accounts from one particular hotel in a short period of time I take notice. I don't care if it is 2 star or 5 star. This type of thing CAN happen and I sure won't belittle someone who has worthwhile information and no vested interest in the status quo."
"Well, I don't know about the OP's situation, and the situation at the hotel right now, but I will tell you what happened to me in December.I was at Dreams PB in december; it was my second experience at an AI. Before that I have travelled to Mexico in other types of accomodations, inlcuding, living with a family for a month. During my stay at Dreams PB, myself, and hubby were both stomach sick for the first time ever on a trip south. I did the probiotic yogourt before I left, didn't drink too much, or eat too much, and was careful with the sun (I am very fair skinned). I wouldn't want to blame it on the food, but considering that it happened a few days in the trip, and that it didn't get better until we were back home, I really don't know what else it could be. On the other hand, I don't think starting topics like this helps solve the problem in any way. Maybe mentionning in the review you had tummy problems would have been enough?Also, I think you should post your own experience (you and those close to you), rather than report what somenone told you... either you were sick, or you were not, what happened to other people isn't really first hand experience (thus should not necessarily be reported). Just my 2 cents... :)"
"I just read this post after the ""Tell the truth and go"" and had to chuckle a bit.."
let me clarify my response to the OP. First. I AM NOT SAYING that you are lying...my MAIN beef with the post is that you NAMED a resort worker..who's much needed job you MAY have put in jeapordy. Yes illness happens. I do not believe that the mere presence of antibacterial gel washes PROVES the resort has an issue. we have been to several that have practiced this preventative measure..and in fact I also practice it in my restaurant. I am NOT saying that the post is a lie...just a very careless post. ..one that could cause an innocent person to lose his job.sigh.Lynn.off her soap box..cause i have to finish packing for my next trip to PC
"My concern is not the reality of the issue of illness, but the vagueness of the term ""lots"".Lots of people visit Punta Cana. How many is lots????The problem with the original post is the vagueness. Perhaps a better worded observation would lead to a more understanding audience.Aside from the illnesses observed...or in this case...mentioned by a staff member...how was your mini vacation? Better than your stay in Varadero???CheersPCMike"
"I don't know why everyone is so upset with this posting. I personally am glad that they made mention to this. They didn't say don't go there, they just made a comment. The truth is, they do have poor sanitation there and I'm sure they are not very knowledgable about food handling, cross contamination and food borne illnesses. I always carry a prescription of Cipro with me whenever I go out of the country. It seems like there were also a few postings of people getting sick earlier in Jan at the Dreams Punta Cana resort. It only takes one not to wash their hands after visiting the bathroom."
I'm sorry to say that this post is worthless without providing more information.# of people sick?What does sick mean?Information verified from someone other than a worker you named that could now be unemployed?
"I think this thread is kinda goofy...lol.""I do not like second hand information but when I saw six people last Thursday evening spewing their guts out in the airport departure area, I had to ask where they were and what their problem was....that is where I got the story of 38 of 42 hospitalized at a resort and another lady told me she was at, well you know where......and had been sick for 2 days""They were actually spewing in the departure area, how rude....lmao. So, what was the name of the resort and was it very recent?Thanks Wud,Cheers, Debbie"
Girl-what are u doing up - you should be getting packed for your voyage to Punta Cana :)
"LOL, that's why I'm up.... I'm so far behind and soooo much to pack... YIKES.Cheers, Debbie"
"If they are passing out hand sanitizer to guests, it sounds like they suspect it to be a viral thing that is being passed around....something that can happen anywhere. It's also something that eventually runs it's courseYet, there will be the flood of posts from people who are planning to go there and will panic. There will also be the flood of responses from those who will always say it was due to overindulgence on the part of guests. There is always the two extreme responses to these types of posts without any middle ground. I would think that if it's true that a large number of people are experiencing the same symptoms at the same time, there could very well be some virus. So, it shouldn't be automatcally dismissed, nor should it be a source of panic.I am in the third week of an illness that was going through my office. Four people had bad cold like symptoms, sore throats, lung congestion, etc that lingers for weeks. I wouldn't quite my job and go work someplace else beliveing it couldn't happen elsewhere nor would I expect my co-workers who did not catch it to say ""you guys did something to bring it on yourselves.""Yes, a lot of people overindulge at resorts and blame their illness on the resort. The act of traveling, eating different foods and the abundence of free alcohol is the most likely cause when one or two people report illness. But it's not outside the realm of possibility that a guest brings along a stomach virus or other type of virus and passes it to others."
"Our group will be going in 3 weeks. I'll think about this, but I won't really worry about it. Kind of heard the same thing in 08 when we went to Ocean Blue. Came back full, but not sick."
hlywood your a pessimiste
"we are going there in a few days...is it bad enough in your opinion to change last minute to another resort or is it like Mexico and be vigilant.Joe, Toronto"
"I am also going in a few days, do we cancel and go somewhere else? or just stick it out and see?? I am very nervous actually!!!"
"If you've booked a package I'm afraid you're stuck going this place. I don't blame anyone being nervous. I would be too. This property has a problem, a big problem. It doesn't sound food borne. I'd be more inclined to think it is something like norovirus going around and around but who knows? I'm just guessing. Something IS making people sick and it isn't only one or two folks either. I've been watching the reviews. Even those who rate the property highly are mentioning sickness. All you can do at this point is be very vigilant. Carry your own hand sanitizer everywhere with you and use it frequently."
Thanks for the update. It is really appreciated. Hope you had a good time.We are leaving today and will be as vigilant as possible. I thought that I only had to worry about this stuff in Mexico.Joe and Samuela
"I think that the OP may have a valid point...three of the five most recent reviews state that one or both travellers in their parties also were ill, and they all seemed to be there at the same time.I am in no way blaming the resort, because these things happen. In fact, I just put a hold on rooms for Spring Break...hoping to convince my husband over the weekend that we need to go away!!"
When we get back on Saturday Feb.20th we will post something with regards to the Dreams Palm Beach.Joe
"Voyagers4,We might pass at the airport. We arrive on the 20th. Hope all goes well for you on your trip. Stay healthy.Micool"
"Joe,My Husband and I are going the first week in March, and are staying at the Dreams in Punta Cana .Can you please let me know how your trip went and if anyone gets sick .Thanks Annette"
I am also going the first week in March and am concerned about getting sick.Please let me know how your stay is and if anyone gets ill.atesta NY
"Yes there has been sickness at the resort, tourist in the village have been saying so.From what I reads only 2 peoples never get andy problems at thse resort, and theys always going there many time.from the beach in cabeza"
If only there were a poster on these forums who had connections at the resort would find out what was really going on and post their findings. That would be AMazingly helpful.

"Simply washing hands properly with soap & water before eating will be as effective (if not more so) than using alcohol gels. They are best used when there is no available wash-room.Also be aware that alcohol based gels can be very toxic in young children, so again should be avoided 'routinely'. Norwalk/Noro-virus is indeed extremely infectious, mainly person to person but if I was booked to visit a resort where they had this, I wouldn't change my plans but would simply increase hand washing, especially before eating."
"One of the sister properties of my favorite resort in Jamaica had an outbreak of norovirus last year. As soon as it was discovered, they promptly closed the resort for several weeks to avoid further spread and to disinfect, and re-booked incoming guests for one of their other properties or gave them vouchers for later dates. It was a brief inconvenience for a few, and certainly a major revenue loss for them, but it protected a lot more people and preserved their reputation as a resort chain that cares about its guests' welfare. They acknowledged the problem clearly on their website and made information clearly available for travel agents. I don't know what is truly going on at Dreams, but if they are really dealing with a similar situation, the way this other hotel handled would serve as a good model."
"For anyone going in the next week or two could you please post your experience as we are headed there in March and I am becoming incresingly nervous.Also, does anyone know if the resort has been made aware of what is being said? I sent an email asking about the illness but have yet to receive a response. I don't know if they will acknowledge this for fear of losing business."

"That's too bad. If I was going there soon, I would want all the information I could get."
TA should be about sharing information good and bad - what happened to get the truth then go
I agree with sharing info but the other thread became more about being a personal attack. That has no position in a travel forum.
Sorry to hear that - that must have happened after I read itTA could however have just deleted out those posts
"Thanks, hope you have a good trip and of course illness free. Looking forward to heaing about the trip."
"I do agree Flip. Individual messages often get deleted. Cannot see why the sharing of observations would be a problem, be them good or bad. Could it be that a few from this board are making certain that they are pressing the inappropiate button...enough so to have the post deleted?I guess we will never know.The issue at hand is not an unusual occurance during the winter months...regardless of destination or resort. At times everyone (without conclusive evidence) jumps on the worst case scenerio bandwagon, which unfortunately is not really fair to the resort or it's employees, who work hard to minimize any health issues...be it a round of the flu...brought down by those evil tourists from the north or any other possible occurance.I know that Dreams runs a tight ship and they have a health and safety manager on hand daily to watch for abnormal occurances of illness...whatever the cause. This can be said also for the vast majority of resorts in the area.You might find it odd that it is me....defending the resort....but, what we are hearing is speculation and suspisions. Whatever is going on at the resort, the management team...all of them would be taking proactive actions at this time to irradicate the situation...whatever that might beCheersPCMike"
"I think there's a place for this discussion on Trip Advisor. Hopefully others do too. Something as scary and potentially as serious as this deserves open discussion.Quick question, does anyone recall a property they've stayed at handing out hand sanitizer all over the resort?"
Riu's did it a few years back in Puerto Plata.CheersPCMike
Thanks PCMike. So it's not unprecedented. Why did the Riu's do it? Preventive measure or was there a problem at the resort?
"I travelled to Mexio(Cancun) from Jan 23-30 of this year. There was a stomache flu bug going around at the resort I stayed in. My friend, another friend's son & my daughter contracted it. Only lasted 24 hrs but it was severe. After talking to others on the resort we discovered many travellers & family members either had it or were just getting over it. I realized that on the way to Mexico one bathroom was being used exclusively for one ill traveller. So it was quite obvious to me that the one person had spread it on the plane therefore I'm not surprised to hear about this case. Planes are a breeding ground for germs. Remeber to bring sanitizers with you as I learned my lesson well during this trip....Ps we had a great time aside from the sickness"
"Come hell or high water, I'm still gonna have fun. One more week till paradise,, or parasites,, whichever. I'm havin fun.MIcool."
"PC Mike,Even though I did not book a trip with you, I would so much love to meet you and maybe toss down a cold one. We will be at the dreaded Dreams Palm Beach from Feb 20 to the 27th. Is there a possibility that we could hook up for a few minutes and have a cool one and talk for a few? That would be fantastic. Looking forward from hearing from you.Thanks, MIcool"
"The latest review is more of the same, this time from a two year Trip Advisor member with 3 reviews. In spite of her friend, friend's husband and her husband getting sick she did say she enjoyed her vacation and hoped to go back some day."
Hi STColbert.. here's some info on the Riu's from the north coast that you asked about. dailymail.co.uk/news/article-394601/Holiday-… At the time it made quite a news story in England.
Thank you elsiemon. Did they ever figure out the cause of the illness? Did the Riu close down for sanitizing?I wonder why the current stance both on their own Facebook Fan Page and Trip Advisor seems to be ignore/deny there's a problem? Seems like a few comforting words would help those soon to travel there.
"I do tend to agree with you on the Facebook statement. I have only recently started to use Facebook as I wanted to find out information on the new Secrets Resorts in Jamaica and I fully agree that their own personnel seem quite selective in the posts they answerIn addition as by definition they are ""fan pages"" the fans are normally very upbeat"
"Strange indeed flipflop_man. The latest returnee paints an even grimmer picture on the Fan page. ""We just came home early this morning. There is a rampant illness there, fast becoming an epidemic if not already so""You can read the rest here.http://www.facebook.com/DreamsPalmBeach"
"I have heard back from Dreams Palm Beach and wanted to share with you their response to my concerns. ""Throughout this time of year, seasonal flu and infections (such as gastroenteritis, norovirus, traveler’s diarrhea and other stomach ailments) are common in the United States, Canada and other countries. Dream Palm Beach takes the safety and security of its guests as its highest priority. We have in place numerous measures to reduce the spread of illness including stringent protocols for cleaning and disinfecting all areas, regular inspections by independent laboratories to ensure food quality and safety, numerous training programs on safety and hygiene, onsite medical staff, just to name a few of our procedures.""They also shared that for the past 2 days there have been illness free.I hope this is of some help to those of you who are having concerns.Happy Travels!bb/mt"
"Thanks for the info bb,We arrive on Saturday and I've been keeping an eye on this situation. We were going regardless, but this does give one hope that maybe with a little luck, the week will turn out fine and illness free, minus the self induced version, ie too much Presidente. 6 more days!!MICool"
"That statement seems to be causing a small mutiny on the Dreams Facebook page since it seems contradictory to what people just back today are reporting. ""We just came home early this morning. There is a rampant illness there, fast becoming an epidemic if not already so. We only met one couple there who did not get sick. Personally, I got sick after the first day and was sick for 4 days. There were people contracting it the day of departure and one poor child was throwing up walking to the plane."""
"If you look at the day on Facebook, that post is from Friday.. I hope they are illness free and looking to hear from those headed there this week as I am going next month."
"Let's hope it's better for you come your trip Dee0304 but the post I'm speaking of was from 12:41pm yesterday. It's hidden under a question by Warren Robinson. Also since then another Fan has posted. This is what she wrote as of 7 hours ago.""To any one who is wondering, there is for sure still a flu outbreak at Dreams. My boyfriend is vacationing there with his children. He arrived on Thurs. and all 3 kids have been ill. He managed to avoid it till this morning when he got it. He has been vomiting all day."" Through all this Dreams management has remained silent both on Trip Advisor and on it's own fanpage, well except for the statement a few posts above. Seems like the part of being illness free for two days was premature at best, at worst an outright lie by Dreams."
"Sickness like this can happen at any resort, even a high end 5+ star property. It's how the situation is handled that I look for. I'm not convinced Dreams is prepared to do the right thing and suffer financial consequences right in the middle of high season. Time will tell."
"I think the fact that Dreams isn't even admitting there's a problem speaks volumes.Even more curious is that the response from Dreams given through baltobabe seems suspiciously similar to a response to a review given by management of Club Med on January 27th in the review section. ""Your wellness is important to us. During this time of year, seasonal flu and infections (such as gastroenteritis, norovirus, travelers diarrhea and other stomach ailments) are common in the United States and other countries.Club Med takes the safety and security of its guests as its highest priority.

A reputable travel agent I spoke to today actually mentioned it to me when I was looking at another hotel.She stated 14 people had been struck down.
"Since so many post are being posted from Facebook here is the latest from someone who sounds like they are knowledgeable instead on posting just the one post over and over..  Laura Gagas Temke To all who are hearing about the ""illness"". I was there exactly 3 weeks ago, and none of our friends or family were seriously ill. A few (including myself) had some GI issues which were mostly self induced, and a few had drank the water in the hotel rooms which you are not supposed to do. I work as a health inspector i...n the United States and I do have to admit I saw very many positive sanitation measures and good food handling practices. My advice would be to be careful, take extra measures while using public restrooms and facilities. Practice excellent hand washing, and watch what and how much you eat and drink. If you have more concerns about this or if there is wide spread illness, the Center for Disease Control has more information on the website. Also, you can always talk with your local doctor prior to going.

"I don't think anyone is questioning that Dreams is a quality resort. What is in question is they seem to be ignoring at least publicly that they have an illness problem at the resort. It's leaving people who will soon be traveling there in a quandary. By the way, how do you feel about them plagiarizing almost verbatim the reply from Club Med back in January? Seems a little disingenuous don't you think?"
But us there hard evidence that they actually HAVE a major problem? You will always have a certain level of ilness at any Ai tropical resort because of the combination of over eating/drinking/Sun/local water.
"I guess that would be if you're inclined to believe the original poster of this topic, who by the way appears to have been a little more accurate than some originally thought, the four recent or current travelers to Dreams Palm Beach posting on it's own Facebook Fan page or the multiple recent trip reports here on Trip Advisor that speak of widespread illness. And if you think about it isn't it odd that they commented that there have been no illnesses for the last 2 days, (even though this has been contested by someone currently ill at the resort) ? They're not denying there was a problem only stating it's all better now. And seriously, if a resort is using a reassurance letter stolen from Club Med as their own can they really be trusted?"
Im worried about this sickness thing at the resort. Ive not been away for a few years and treated ourselves to a 2 week break in the lovely DR and now its tainted with sickness reviews. Do we go and chance it ?? I dont know what else we can do....
"It's now been two weeks since i posted this topic, at the beginning people did not want to believe what i saw, but what i said was very true, another bunch of buddies just came back sunday morning from a gotravelsouth 4 1/2 star wildcard that landed them at dreams palm beach and illness is still very much there and management knows very well about the problem.Some people land in hospital for iv treatment, dehydration i guess from all that vomiting and whathever, plus on the plane back from Punta cana (flairair) on sunday morning people from that hotel were very very sick vomiting and doing it in their pants on the plane. some of my buddies were also sick for about 24 hours but they all say the same thing the resort is great as for food service and cleannest everything was excellent."
"Glad I'm not on the plane coming home with these folks. I wonder how many are getting ill after they return home after being near these poor people. Gosh my heart goes out to those suffering. What I don't like is it appears the resort knows full well there is a big problem and no doubt they are doing what they can to stop it. What does disturb me is an obvious cover up and denial to the outside world. I absolutely refuse to believe that so many guests at this particular hotel all decided to over indulge at the same time and place and those who claim such nonsense are not doing any good for guests or even the hotel itself. I was also a health care professional for 32 years, being in the field of microbiology. I know how these viruses spread. They are fighting an uphill battle. All I can say is good luck to Dreams which are a good, decent hotel chain with high standards without a doubt."
I did not stay here but returned on Saturday and spoke to 6 guests at the hotel at the airport and they said that each of them got sick for a day or 2.
There were two more reviews posted overnight speaking of widespread illness. It's a shame the only words heard from the resort on this were not even their own. Not very nice of them jeopardizing baltobabe's good name by having her post information both here and on facebook that was written by Club Med and posted in response to a review of Club Med weeks ago. The continued silence and level of deceit being shown Dreams is disturbing.
"It would seem according to reviewers that Dreams is going all out to stop this problem. Just wish they'd be honest.Check out reviews for Natura Park which is next property to the north of Dreams. Sounds like the same deal. The difference is management at Dreams are trying to do something and care about their guests, the same doesn't appear to be the case at Natura."
"hey marg..i am home :-(have to comment on Natura Park...as that is where we stayed again. Yes some were sick (my greg included) but the resort WERE being vigilant. They were testing the food temps constantly, sending water and light food to rooms of people not feeling well..giving late checkouts for free for those people with late flights but not feeling well...so yes they were taking care of the guests...but heard several people moaning about it..so i asked a couple of them if they had alerted management that they were also sick...guess what. NOPE.Now that being said. i can tell you that unless security on the beach improves, this illness will spread through all of the resorts on that stretch...why? because there were several people with no wristbands (dreams is the only resort on this stretch without bands) and also some grand oasis bands eating at the beach buffet, and the snack bar. There was a group from the oasis that spent a full day lounging with guests from natura..and YUP they went to the beach hut for burgers. Not one staff member from Natura (THAT I SAW) turned them away. Greg talked to one guy in the pool, who was staying at dreams. His excuse? too many sick over there. sigh.,cheersLynn"
"I agree with you to a certain extent margadagio, they do seem to be taking care of their guests once they get to there. The problem I see is they aren't informing guests there that there's a potential problem and giving them the choice to stick with Dreams and take taking the chance, a good chance it seems of getting ill or to find another resort to stay at. I think I'd like to know ahead of time the risks involved, if any of staying at a particular resort."
"Thanks for the info, Lynn. Nice to know the resort is taking care of guests. The reviews suggest otherwise and unfortunately that's what folks read.I agree there are big problems. Whatever it is spreads like wildfire. I'm thinking only a matter of time before even Catalonia could be affected. It will only take one or two guests going for a beach stroll to spread the virus. These hotel managers must be having a fit right now. I don't envy them."
"i am going to write a review also of natura, but i believe that first i have to have my previous review removed?anyway you are right marg..the last few reviews of natura sound alot like the reviews of DPB don't they? It will be interesting to see if the oasis soon starts getting the same reviews. Hopefully not too many people will walk all the way to the Cat...for their sake. whatever this illness is, i do not believe it is necessarily food bourne. Reason being, i ate almost the exact same stuff as greg, i had NO alcohol all trip, and greg maybe had 3-4 on resort alcoholic bevies all week..plus a few beers off resort with the guys.. much less than normal lolThis morning i was reading an article of norwalk virus and guess what? Sounds about right for greg's symptoms. He was lucky, only one full day down, but man was that a bad day. He never left bed except to enter the bathroom. Lynn"
"Lynn, I guessed way back in this thread they were possibly dealing with a norovirus (Norwalk). The problem is this thing is unbelievably contagious if indeed this is the situation. You are lucky that you haven't got ill yet."
"I live in Northern Virginia and the 24 hour flu has been going through my neighborhood. The kids are just back to school today after being snowed in for the last week and a half and I expect that it will REALLY intensify/spread with all that close contact. It's probably the same thing that has been carried to the resorts and spreads like mad. My sister in law lives in Massachussetts and she and her husband just got over it. Sounds like it just a matter of time before it gets to your town too. Personally, I think that topics like this are helpful to get to the bottom of issues when people discuss them rationally and don't attack the OP just because they brought up something that they don't want to hear. I've been to PC 6 times and I love it...even though it's not alway perfect. I always check with this forum for a month or so before going to find out the good and bad that's going on.Cindy"
The Noro(Norwalk Virus) is not a flu it is caused by unsanitary handling of food and spread by not washing your hands after going to the bath room. There is not a shot you can get to prevent the spread of this virus.I'm not an expert just a woman who does'nt want her vacation ruined by illness.
"here is a page on norwalk type viruses, and as you will see written here, there is no preventative shot to ward it off. If someone has the virus and goes to a resort,,doesn't practice good hygiene...well...next thing you know ..the ten people behind the infected person have just touched the serving utensils ect that the infected person touched....that pizza? those fries? did you use a knife and fork...doubt it. Did your fingers touch your mouth?? likely,,,,,,and so it spreadsinfo here…mtsinai.on.ca/faq/norwalkfaq.shtmloff to work nowto save for our next vacation to PC lolcheers allLynn"
hope for them this all stops soon
Two new trip reports mentioning the illness at Dreams came in overnight. Natura Park seems just as bad. At what point do the resorts acknowledge there's a problem and take the proper measures to eradicate it?

"STColbert,I understand your and other people concern and I do appreciate that.My question to you today is this...have you personally reached out to either of these resorts and made an effort to communicate with them? And if so what have been the results of your communication.I think perhaps your tireless efforts on this thread might be put to better use by trying to help in that way.Rather than coming on this forum and spreading fear and stirring the pot and making accusations you could be pro active and get in touch with the resorts that you are questioning and then share your results with us here.Just a thought,,,all the best and Happy Travels to those going soon!bb/mt"
"Baltobabe,You still rock!!! Joanne x"
"* DITTO ~ This is a travel forum where vacationers come aboard to GET info and be provided sources in which to gather additional info, if need be. BB provided information AND a contact quite a few days ago for any traveler who needed to speak to the resort directly and yet there is still a demand from STColbert for a response from cyber strangers. STColbert , are you headed to the resort anytime soon? If so, please follow the advice given to you by a reliable source, who attempts to help again...~ You are beating a dead horse at this point and are being disruptive and trying to stir panic amongst future travelers.

We look forward to your passionate and active participation on the board in the future.PeaceLea"
"I hope folks going to this resort do write and ask what is going on. I'd love to know the replies.Dreams should pull a ""RIU"" and get rid of the mess. Just look at the reviews. One right after another. Check out the review by MikaOttawa. This is a repeat guest. How many more like him? You can bet he'll be looking elsewhere his next vacation. No one here is spreading fear and stirring the pot. A bad situation exists. They are writing the truth as are the multiple returning guests from the affected resorts. Folks SHOULD be informed so they can take adequate precautions on their vacations. I find it absolutely disgusting that some people still insinuate there is no problem except for an over indulging guest. The OP was given a rough time when they told the truth. I believed the person at the time. It happened to me with a resort that eventually had to temporarily shut down but at the time I was blasted by ""friends"" of the area. Tour operators are protecting their bottom line, not the paying customer. People respect honesty and clarity. Somebody from Dreams should go on that Facebook page and spill the beans. Tell folks what measures they have in place to overcome the problem and tell the truth about the status of numbers ill. baltobabe, no one should be expecting you to be giving info. I believe it is up to management at Dreams themselves to be proactive in communication. It isn't up to you or any other paying guest and it is wrong to specifically ask that."
Good morning baltobabe. My post is sticking to the facts. I stated there are more reports of illness being reported and there are. Nothing more. This IS an important topic and one that shouldn't be buried.I'm sure there's not one of us who hasn't posted something they've regretted. I have. I am trying to leave personalities out of this which admittedly I failed to do before. Maybe you can see it in your heart to do the same?

Thank you margadagio.
you guys are right. there is no chance a 3rd world country hotel would lie about something going on at their hotel. they would say 'ya alot are sick but dont worry come on down'. sometimes you just have to wonder who these freaks are that say these silly comments. if reviews say people are getting sick- then people are getting sick. the hotel will not tell the truth my god people
Heres the latest …wordpress.com/2010/…
Theyhave replied to my email asking what is going on. They are saying some clients have been affected by seasonal flu ( stomach flu ).
Looks like they haven't ignored the situation and are taking proper measures to insure safety.
Kudos to Dreams for their quick response. Hopefully this fixes the problem. Safe and happy travels to all heading there soon.
"Personally, I'm sick of this post.Happens at every resort every year.Take precautions and enjoy your visit or stay at home."
"Hello All,I have attempted to contact the resort through e-mails both directly to the resort and to AM Resorts (who manage all the Dreams) and the only response I received was from AM saying they forwarded my email to the resort directly and I still have not received a response.I then called the resort yesterday and was told by the staff everything is perfect there, no one is sick. I explained that a statement had been published and he still stated I would be home upon arrival and everyone is perfect there.I am a returning guest there so I know that the resort is clean and it appears that they are attempting to rectify the situation but I am still concerned as I am travelling there in a few weeks and the most recent reviews are people are still sick."
read the info at Dreams and I m sure you ll feel better :)
I hope for your sake Dee it all works out. We'll see but I think the jury is still out on whether the actions taken by Dreams are going to do squat to eradicate this problem. Keep a close eye on the reviews and see how they shake out. You have every right to be skeptical of employees towing the company line. We now know that a statement posted here on Sunday that they had been illness free for two days appears to be disinformation.Edited: 10 years ago 
And sadly 17 reviews as of this posting have mentioned becoming ill in their trip reports in the 5 days since the resort declared themselves illness free for 2 days.
"Maybe this is wishful thinking, but do you think the reports have crossed paths with the hotels statement of being free from new illness in last 2 days ?? By the time people return and then log onto TA to update it may look illness is still going when it may be slowing down over at the hotel with new cases.I really hope this clears up soon :("
"I hope it's gone by tomorrow, as that is the day we arrive. Some of the latest reviews don't give a real shining hope all is well.As in football , when it's 4th and long, you punt.MICool"
"Wishing those who are going down to the resorts that seem to be having this issue the very best travels!Please be pro active in your travels, take along your own hand sanatizer ( I love the ones from Bath and Body) Use them all the time! When you eat at any resorts buffet be watchful of serving yourself, someone earlier posted about taking your own utensils from the table and serving from the buffet that way. I would suggest taking small packs of handi wipes or something similiar and wiping down your utensils just as an added precaution.Also I use a product call AirBorne when I travel on the plane, it might be a good thing to take a daily dose of this too in the morning. Its a tablet that fizzes in a glass of water and has diffent flavors.ALL of the resorts are being vigilent and the travelers going down should be also.I wish you all a MOST WONDERFUL Vacation no matter which resort you are going to! Safe and HAPPY TRAVELS ALL!bb/mt"
"Thanks bb,Even tho there seems to be a cloud of doubt hanging over the resorts, I stillcan't wait to arrive and have some fun.We will soon see. Maybe I can do a few live at Dreams while I'm there.Rob"
Rob that would be AWESOME if you could share with a LIVE FROM!Travel safe and have FUN in the SUN! bb/mt
Another suggestion. Be careful on your flight down and back. I'm not sure how well the airlines are cleaning these planes between flights. Might be a good idea to pack a few wipes and small amount of hand sanitizer in your carry on. Guests need to be proactive towards their own health. The hotel can't do everything.
"Just got back from Dreams Palm Beach yesterday and I can assure you, no amount of hand sanitizer is going to protect you from whatever is going around. People are vomiting in the corridors and they can't clean it up fast enough. Management is blaming the victim on this one, saying that Americans are bringing the sickness from home, it's not something at the hotel. Everyone we met had experienced the sickness, and it was awful, both ends. Management is ignoring the problem. You can see my review for more details but the doctor onsite said she hadn't slept for days because of the number of sick travelers.I didn't see the statement on Feb. 14 saying they were illness-free, but we arrived on Feb. 14 and I can assure you, it's rampant still. We cut our vacation short because it was so awful.As I said in my review, don't go here now. The place needs to be shut down and bleached. And thanks to the person who started this post, wish I'd read it before I left."
"Wow, Janesports! Your post, alone, should be enough to make people change their travel plans. There is no way I'd go there right now! Best of luck to those of you who have no choice.Kris"
I agree with Daisy. Sorry to here about your experience Janesports. See post #67 in this thread for the illness free posting..
"So sorry, Janesports. I too previously have been saying the place should be shut down and deep cleaned. Management implied it is under control. I said before this is NOT something that will go away easily. They shut down cruise ships. They'll have to do the same thing at Dreams. The company is doing long term damage to their reputation by refusing to do the right thing.Unfortunately many guests cannot change their travel plans without losing all their money. They are locked in by the tour operators. Unless the hotel shuts their doors, guests are stuck."
"Thanks.I really believe if you have young children or a medical condition that going there right now is unsafe. As for the blame the victim stuff, that it's due to overindulging, I'll just say that my 7-year-old and I hadn't been drinking any alcohol prior to becoming violently ill."
If its Norovirus ( sound very much like it with the winter season) then Alcohol based hand sanitizer does not kill Norovirus.Its good old soap that needed & lots of it.The A UK health site has some good advise.Good hand washing with soap and water is the key to preventing norovirus from spreading. Alcohol handgel does not kill norovirus. Staff should clean their hands before and after touching any patient but it is particularly important that they wash their hands with soap and water after tending to a norovirus patient to prevent it spreading to other patients via their hands. Visitors should wash their hands with soap and water after visiting a ward which has norovirus and they should not interact with other patients other than the person they’ve come to visit. Staff and visitors should wash their hands before handling food and after visiting the toilet.www.royalfree.nhs.uk/default.aspx…Edited: 10 years ago 
As you say - most people cannot cghange their destination now as its too late. The hotel should admit the problem and shut down for a deep cleanse. This will save their reputation and save everyone from worry who don't want to enter a place full of illness.Its terrible !!Edited: 10 years ago 
any other travellers experiencing problems with resorts in the area close to Dreams and Natura.
"We were supposed to arrive at Dreams Palm Beach tomorrow for a week. We just cancelled and are losing money but it is not worth the threat of illness, not getting what you payed for, and the fear of touching anything or breathing in germs. Dreams wasn't much help, they give you all the standard answers. Apple vacations wouldn't help with a transfer either. No help anywhere! Very frustrating. I have medical issues and an illness like this could put me down and out for the week and maybe into the hospital. Just can't risk it, but you would think Dreams or Apple would be more accomodating! We are sure that Dreams is a lovely and clean resort but their reputation is now being ruined at least short term. These illnesses are normal and do happen every year, so why can't some type of emergency plan be set up?Best of luck to all but you have to do what is right for your situation."
"Cubfans, I am so glad to hear that you are putting your health first. Dreams is not owning up to the severity of the problem. I am sorry you will lost money but believe me you are saving yourself a great deal of discomfort."
I just posted this on facebook but as I'm reading I see a lot of people who are from the UK and Canada who are posting that they were getting sick just wondering if those from the US are having the same issues. I am going on March 6th and can't change plans now.
"Holly,Saw you also posted on Facebook. I am from New York, and your country of origin did not insulate you from illness. We met other Americans who had been ill, as well as a British family with five children who were all sick for several days.Transfer to another hotel. You will have peace of mind during your travels."
"Thanks Janesport,I wish I could. I will take a chance and hopefully I will be one of the lucky ones. I have been reading that the same thing is happening at Moon Palace and Natura Eco.Thanks,"
"Sorry your first post had to deal with something like this. Unfortunately this illness is non-discriminatory when it comes to nationality. I've seen in the reviews people from Chicago, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Wisconsin coming down with whatever is running rampant at Dreams within the past week."
I've heard about Natura but Moon Palace? That's a new one and would NOT be good news if true considering it's distance from Dreams. Can I ask where you came across that information? Was it just an isolated instance of someone being sick as is the case at pretty much any resort or was it a resort wide issue?
"There was a person who posted on the Dreams Palm Beach Punta Cana Facebook page (www.facebook.com/DreamsPalmBeach…) who mentioned an episode of this illness at Moon Palace:""Its not just this resort. My mother and the company she works for just had their annual conference at Moon Palace in Punta Cana and 17 people got sick. Must be something in the water/food this year. Bring some Tamiflu!"""
I have read reviews where dozens of people reported they were ill. And only a percentage post reviews. Our trip was just the opposite and I can't wait to go back.
"OK, thanks Janesorts. I didn't recall seeing any mention on Trip Advisor of illness at Moon Palace."
Thanks I feel much better after reading your post but I still put a call into my doctor for some Tamiflu.
"atesta--if there is a virus going through whatever resort, Tamiflu is not going to help you."
I just read that Barcelo Dominican Republic has been having issues as well. I think I will just think positive and go for broke!! DR here we come!!!
Google Norovirus ( sometimes know as Norwalk or Winter vomiting disease/ cruise ship virus)Tamiflu is for Influenzavirus not NorovirusAlso Alcohol handgel does not kill norovirus.Enhanced cleaning using bleach-containing products is needed to eradicate norovirus from the environment.Norovirus can go airborne when in a confined area.Also think of raw sewage going into the sea & you can see how rapidly a large outbreak can take place.Edited: 10 years ago 
"I am not sure that this malady is limited to Dreams Palm Beach. If I were traveling to Punta Cana tomorrow I would read the most recent reviews here of any hotel I planned to visit. I will say that knowing what I know now, I would have cancelled my visit to Dreams Palm Beach and considered it a wash. Watching my daughter throw up repeatedly was worse than any financial hit I'd have taken."
"When all is said and done, Dreams needs to shut down for a short while. Given the number of ill guests and the fact it doesn't seem to be slowing at all, the company really needs to do the right thing. They need to close so that their clients aren't facing having to make a decision to go and potentially get ill or face cancelling and losing not only their vacation but thousands it costs to go there too. Most people save all year for their trips and I feel really bad for everyone in this situation. Gawd, what a decision.I also put blame on the tour operators. Their reps on the ground know full well what is happening. As far as I'm concerned the TO's should cease selling this package until the problem is sorted out completely. Sunquest, Signature, Sunwing, Air Canada all have flights to DPB leaving this Sunday through Tuesday. What the bloomin' H are they thinking? I guess the almighty dollar trumps everyone's wellness."
"MICOOLIf you can, let us know what is going on there. I hope that you have a safe and healthy trip and have nothing but good things to report. Look forward to hearing from you soon! Enjoy and have a cold one for us! :)"
someones posted on the facebook page that 2 members of their family were ill for 48 hours and they had to fly home early...It doesnt look like things are easing up over there.
I am very sorry for everyone who is ill while on vacation!! I have been there done that....We have also recently gone through a situation where we needed to make a change to our itinerary. We lucked out and the airline worked with us.However if Air Jamaica would not have refunded our airfare we had purchased Cancel Anytime/Medical Trip Insurance. This is a small investment that protects you in cases like this. We do not purchase the insurance offered through the tour operator.We go through a web site called Squaremouth.com they compare hundreds of policies with varying prices. Once again we all need to be PROACTIVE!!! Yes it would be nice for resorts to allow us to change in times like this. However we all need to look out for ourselves and not rely on people/companies who only have their own interests at heart in times like this.I will keep everyone in my thoughts.
"It's a shame that even while this illness appeared to be getting worse there were people praising Dreams for the measures taken to fix the problem. It now appears those measures are more window dressing than anything else. I also can't help but think the empty reassurances of some posters here have contributed to some people not changing their plans and will currently or soon to be vacationing at what appears to be a toxic resort. Lea, do you still think me keeping this topic going was a disservice to Trip Advisor members and that I was just stirring the pot? It's obviously an unpopular stance to take on Trip Advisor but I felt it was necessary. I've noticed you are now calling for drastic measures and the resort to be shut down. Go figure.I hope all the people currently heading there somehow avoid this illness and manage to have the times of their lives. I hope MICools positive attitude and the special attention I'm sure he'll be receiving as a potential ""Live From"" poster will ensure a successful trip.Edited: 10 years ago "
"STColbert - why do you assume MICool will receive ""special treatment"" if he gets the chance to post anything while he is on vacation? Many people post ""live from"" threads, or ""I'm here right now"" threads from the resorts they are visiting and do not recieve ""special treatment"". If this illness outbreak is still going on at Dreams Palm Beach while he is there, and if DPB is not doing what they can/should in the opinions of their past/current/future guests (and I don't recall reading that you have been any of those), I would think the last thing that Dreams would want is someone posting ""live"", and rewarding that with ""special treatment"".This is an important thread so that ACTUAL returning guests can relay their experiences, good or bad, sick or not, for the benefit of those who have plans to vacation here. It is also important for ACTUAL currernt guests to be able to relay any personal experiences they are having, as far as any interaction/contact/discussions (good or bad) they may have with the Dreams management team."
"Yes, many people do post live from threads, but not usually from a spot currently under the scrutiny of Dreams. In such a case I think it would be naive to think that management wouldn't do their utmost to ensure a higher profile traveler who may be posting live from posts has a few little extras to make that trip special. Obviously since he seems like a genuine and sincere young man this wouldn't stop MICool from posting what he sees but it couldn't hurt. I could be wrong or just a little cynical. Maybe someone like vienemo can offer their thoughts on whether it would be unusual for someone to receive a little extra attention in such a scenario??"
"We just returned from Dreams Palm Beach last night, we cut our trip short from 8 days to 3 days. We arrived on tues.. and we became very ill on thurs. morning with diarrhea with stomach cramps,chills,vomiting. We realized by friday morning we werent gettin better,so we in our best intrest we decided to see if we could book a flight back lucky for us the flight still had opening left. We dont know whats going on at this place but its nothing to ignore as we werent the only ones with illnesses. There other couples also leaving there vacation early do to illness why we were checking out on friday. We talked to 2 of them and it seemed like they had the same symtoms. They stated to us that the medical place at the resort liked like a er room on thursday with all the people in there. My wife seeked medical attention this morning as her symtoms are still very bad, they diaginosed her with Viral Gastroenteritis, a very contagious virus, The doctor stated she could have got it from eating food or drinking liquids that contaminated, touching surfaces or objects that are contaminated or its airborne in certain areas. This is the first for us on a trip to the DR as we been there 4 times already and never had any problems and will continue to go back.Edited: 10 years ago "
Yes it's the same virus that is common on cruise ships and nothing to do with the food. It could have even originated from someone coming of a cruise ship which is a popular combination for Uk tourists.
"We were told that most travel agents and tour operators don't read trip advisor because they think it is just a bunch of competitors stirring up lies. Heard this from several agents. They say they wait until they hear a direct notice from the resort, CDC, or tour operators (Apple, Fun jet, etc...). So don't expect Mike or anyone's post to have total impact."
"I notified my travel agent, the wholesaler and the U.S. consulate in the D.R. When you return from your trip, please do the same. I want the information out so that people can make an informed choice about whether to risk their health. If you are traveling with someone with a health condition, someone with diabetes for example, this is more than just a temporary setback. If it would be painful to you to see a child get so violently ill, take care of your health and avoid this place until the sickness is gone.Some travelers get a mild version, but we didn't had scheduled a 5 day trip so the time we were sick was the majority of our holiday. We returned Thursday and my family is still sick.Dreams has posted something about the steps it is taking to combat the sickness, which is an admission that something is making many people very sick. Notice the hotel is not telling you what the illness is, how many are getting it, what percentage go to the hospital, etc."
Janesports-We cancelled. Our travel agent and Apple Vacations could care less. They could not find an alternate hotel in Punta Cana or another Dreams hotel anywhere in Mx or Carribbean when we told them why we were cancelling. We booked with another travel agent to go to Puerto Vallarta in a week. Hopefully no illness there but it caused a lot of hassle for us and our complaints fell on deaf ears.
"Janesport wrote.... ""I notified my travel agent, the wholesaler and the U.S. consulate in the D.R. When you return from your trip, please do the same. I want the information out so that people can make an informed choice about whether to risk their health.""I think this is probably the best advice and should indeed be done.Cheers, Debbie"
"Tour operators sayno illness has been reported so can't do anything. It's changed now, either you go and risk being crippled with illness or loose all your money if you cancel. Horrendous"
We were fortunate to have purchased travel insurance. Only losing $340 per couple. Won't leave home without it from now on!
Is this sickness only at the Dreams resort??? Or is it all over PuntaCana??We leave in 17 more days and are staying at The Melia....What do we do??
"Just got back from Dreams Palm Beach in Punta Cana and had a GREAT time. We hate to say it but we had a ""sickness"" casualty..my wife. I fly for a major airline and have been around the world with the kids since they were born and never saw tourists drop like flies like I did at this resort.  I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. We used bottled water for EVERYTHING !! We had the kids wash their brushes and rinse with the bottled h2o. We like to drink but never over did it and got average sun per day..too busy participating in all the activities..yet my wife starting vomiting and had diarrhea. She had a fever and was in bed for the entire day on our 4th day into our stay. Everything that she took (like gravol or immodium pills etc..) she vomited. Finally I took her at 5 pm to the doctor on site at resort and she put my wife on "" IV "" and gave her the anti-nausea and pain killer drip.Wish I did this in the early a.m. She slept for 12 straight hours and woke up on the 5th day and we went snorkling with the sharks and stingrays. Wife just said that there is a needle that you can take that prevents vomiting and diarrhea.She just saw an ad forthis. Should ask your doctor about it. Still no cause for this sickness and kids did not ger sick...just be vigilant.Resort was great and got to know lots of staff well. Jhonny the beach bartender was fantastic...tipped him a dollar or two a day and he always took care of me(made my Rum and coke a little stronger without asking) and made my wife his ""specialty"" drinks without knowing what was in them...just that they were very good says my wife!! Staff was FANTASTIC !!My kids (boy 15/girl 12) had the time of their lives. Hooked up with kids from all over the U.S. and Canada and had a group of 17 that hung around on the trampolene in the ocean and at ""Corezones"" teen club til midnight every night. That's it for now and have a great time."
"I stayed at the resort next door and i ended up in the hospital due to gastro illness. my white blood cell count was over 3000. while in there, there were others with the same problem from other resorts for the same thing. i talked to a woman and her daughter that stayed at this resort and they told me there were about 400 people that got sick. whether this is true i can't say. what i do know is the staff at the hospital were very busy dealing with this problem and it didn't seem to be isolated to one resort. anyone going to D.R. would be very wise to get health insurance just in case."
i stayed at another resort last week and ended up in hospital due to gastro illness. my white blood cell count was over 3000. there were other people in hospital from other resorts as well. i talk to one person who stayed at this resort and she said there were approx 400 sick there. whether true i don't know. what i do know is it wasn't resort isolated. if you go have fun but health insurance is a must
"The last two posts sound made up, I think they are trying to fuel the fire."
"One person's post and you dismiss the issue?! The other 158 weren't doing it for you?If you doubt the veracity of Vancouver's account, email me and I can provide with you with plenty of other evidence. Or perhaps I am not real either!"
"The Dreams Facebook page is getting filled with folks returning and telling their first hand experiences. Oh yeah, this is really happening. Don't dare to dismiss those who have had their vacations ruined."
"Get a life dude, I realize there is something happening at Dreams, but that doesn't mean there aren't fake posts trying to fuel the fire. Wake up."
"Lets keep this in perspective - here's some insight...-4 of 10 (40%) of my fellow co-workers have been off in the last 2 weeks due to a virus - yet people (including me) don't think twice about going to work.-There has been a viral outbreak at my daughters daycare where they had to send home 6 kids (due to virus) & completely disinfect the entire place before allowing them back - I saw a posting few days ago at our community centre that there currently is an outbreak of H1N1 in our community- -I am scheduled to go to Melia Caribe RS in a week- What do I say -- GET ME THE HE** OUTTA HERE- I respect the people who may choose not to go on vacation - that is their choice!- My choice however is quite different .... There are risks of getting sick everywhere ... Should I stop using the shopping carts at grocery stores, stop going to ATM machines, & stop using public transit - cause we sure know they don't disinfect the place after each stop... Or how about medical workers - should they stop going to work in fear that they might get sick?- I have been a long time watcher of the PC forum & just had to reply on this one... I appreciated all your feedback & you have enlightened me on many PC topics...- For me - I've accessed the risk & deem it no greater that the status in my community - Punta Cana here I come with my BUBBA in hand - Woooooohooooo!."
"It is true, you can get sick anywhere in the world.We are leaving in 17 days to enjoy our vacation at The Melia.Yes, I'am a little concerned about this virus going around, However, we have been looking forward to this trip since September and we can not predict the future, so we are going to take our chances and go.Positive thinking is what we are doing.Bring on the sun, sand and sea....Cheers!!Happy and healthy travel to all!!!"
The facebook page looks like a war zone this morning. More and more people coming out with tales of illness. Several soon to be guests are anxiously awaiting some comment from Dreams. So far nothing. People seem to be losing their patience with the lack of official information.
I see folks are now down to begging the resort to shut down. I hope everyone is letting their consulates know as well as travel agents and tour operators. I think pressure should come from other hotels in PC too. The problems at Dreams and Natura is affecting the reputation of all Punta Cana. My daughter's friend was about to book a vacation there but after hearing about sickness in PC she is headed to another country.
Might not be a bad idea for someone to tip off a travel or investigative reporter for your local newspaper. Maybe some bad press outside of the relatively small world of Trip Advisor and 2000 plus fans on facebook would encourage them to speak up.
"VancouverSkee,If your white blood cell count was ""over 3000"" you were at the lower end of normal for a woman. Men normally have higher WBC counts. Here is a quote from an article on WebMD:""The white blood cell count shows the number of white blood cells in a sample of blood. A normal white blood cell count is between 4,500 and 11,000 cells per cubic millimeter (4.5 and 11.0 x 109 cells per liter).""

We cancelled a week at DPB and are now rebooked for next week to go to Puerto Vallarta. Don't want to take the chance.
"Travel investigator at local newspaper? What is the saying about glass houses? My city has flue or a flue like sickness running all over. Many people are sick. People are still going to work, school, shopping etc. Under the conditions that you want the resort to shut down then I would have to think that Philadelphia would have to shut down also. Countries should check their people before leaving their country. Airlines should not let any person showing any sypmtoms on their planes, either going or coming from Punta Cana or any location worldwide if you want to stop sickness but that will not happen. I bet in my neighborhood that 20 percent of my neighbors are sick. I understand that the resort has sickness but if they have put precautions in place who are you to keep demanding that they shut down? If the resort is wrong then how wrong are the people who got sick, got on a plane, infected the passengers on the plane then had it spread back home. Take precautions and yes, you may get sick but I can get just as sick going to work right now. To discredit a resort on Trip Advisor is ridiculous because you do not have all the info. It is easy to criticize on the internet! Sorry to those who got sick but the odds of getting sick without travel right now are pretty good also.And in this area right now the sickness comes with a lot of vomiting, head aches etc. and is lasting a few days."
"While I believe you are correct that you can sick anywhere and that you can't blame all the world's woes on one resort, Trip Advisor was intended to provide information to the general public to make informed vacation decisions. These are supposed to be reviews based on both opinions and first hand accounts/visits to the resorts and hotels. Over the years that I have used Trip Advisor (and we do travel alot), I have learned that alot of the opinions have to be taken with a grain of salt, ie differences in food choices, alcohol consumption, cultures, etc... But if people are reporting first hand accounts of serious illness, then it is not ""bashing"" but field reporting!"
"I agree with Cubfans. I don't know what is meant by ""not having all the info,"" but all any of us can do is give a first-hand report of what we experienced so that other travelers can make a more informed choice about where to spend their vacation dollars. Clearly, people like me who have just returned from Dreams Palm Beach witnessed what we thought was an extraordinary situation and want to share that news. This wasn't the usual travel tummy upset by any stretch. If illness is not a concern to someone, it seems like there's no point in reading this thread."
"Thanks to any/all info. that is posted here on TA...this is what it's for! As well, I do take them with a grain of salt and then try to make our best informed decision for our travel plans. Also have to agree that anyone can get sick anywhere these days but you can't stop the life cycle! You just have to take extra precautions to hopefully decrease the chance of getting sick yourselves. Wash hand frequently, eat well, take extra vitamins to boost your immune system if you want/have to. That's what I do! Apparently the Norwalk virus is also right in our hometown....AT OUR LOCAL HOSPITAL, to be precise! And it's currently on 'Quarantine Status' whereby no visitors are allowed in to visit patients, etc. If you have to go there for an outpatient apt. and/or any emergency that comes in, a mask has to be worn. So the hospital is taking serious precautions to try not to let it spread outside and I, of course, will NOT be going to the hospital for ANY reason under my control! However, the workers still have to go to work!! Last fall when our town and much of Newfoundland and other parts of Canada were going through the H1N1 viral outbreaks, we also had 2 co-workers that ended up getting it through school and were at work for a brief period ""before"" they showed any symptoms. But we cleaned throughly and disinfected things to be very careful but remained open.....the rest of us still had to work! And this was BEFORE we had our chance to get our shots!! Boy, did I ever wash my hands frequently during that period....and still do, even at home!! Some people were washing very frequently and then using the sanitizer so often, that they're hands were dried out and sore!! That won't kill some viruses anyways.....simply washing is the best! So this is what we'll do on our vacation in PC this upcoming trip....AT the Dreams Palm Beach Resort! No, we're NOT canceling our trip, but will be cautious and vigilant in our personal hygiene while there!"
"Here is the latest from someone posting on Facebook, it sounds like the situation has improved.Ingrid Piat Just got home this morning from a week at Dreams Palm Beach. I had an amazing time, and I was not sick at all. :) The place was packed. Tons of guests everywhere having a great time and doing activities. It is unfortunate that some people are sick, but don't think for a second that it is a hotel full of people lying around barfing. Quite the opposite is true.6 hours ago · Comment · Like · Reporthttp://www.facebook.com/DreamsPalmBeach"
I hope for everyone soon to travel that's true. I'm just not sure if we can assume things are getting better based on one report. If I'm ill I'm staying in my room not far from the toilet and not out in public.
"Here's a situation that I encountered while using the Internet in the so-called ""preferred"" clubhouse: two couples were vacationing together and one lady was saying her husband had been quite ill all day. The other women with her was worried because they had found that the surface of her tongue had turned brown since they arrived at Dreams Palm Beach, and that woman's husband, too had been sick. I saw the woman's tongue myself and it had not been this way before they arrived. The nice guy at the front desk said she should definitely see a doctor; he had not encountered her tongue issue in the past. Evidently they also had found mold or something in the room because one lady was telling the other ""don't worry, they'll disinfect the whole room top to bottom."" So they were all in the midst of a nightmare. Between this sort of stuff and the, frankly, mediocre food, I'm not ever going back."
"On a question of ""how many is many"": we had seven people in our group and five got sick (two had to take shots). I personally spoke to a lady from Ohio, who had 17 people in her group - 16 got sick."
"kuku,,while i am not dismissing the illness you have described (my husband was violently ill for 24 hrs just over a week ago at natura park..next to dreams) I will tell you that if you take pepto tablets (not liquid) your tounge CAN turn brownish black. ick. but its true..happened to me a couple of years ago. since then i only use liquid pepto...lol. I was using a pepto tab as a preventative each morning.never again.ick ick ickCheersLynn"
"gregnlynn is right. Sure sounds like a case of ""pepto tongue"" to me."
"hI Did you hear about any sickness at the Oasis Grand, which is right next to Dreams ? Only a fence between the two of them. Thanks"
Hi Where did you stay ? The Oasis Grand is the closet to Dreams.
Seriously worried about this sickness as I am pregnant and we are travelling with a 4 year old....however I know it´s too late to change or cancel the holiday....any ideas on what we can take to help prevent the sickness?? (I am preggers though so can´t really take meds)
You can take Acidophiles while preggers can't you? A RN posted somewhere that it may help
"I responded on your other post as well. Your fear is dehydration should you get this thing. I got it last week there, and couldn't eat or drink for 2 days. You would need to go to the hospital for a saline drip if you got it for the sake of your pregnancy, which isn't how you want to spend your vacation.Book elsewhere, this thing is virulent and hits a huge segment of those who arrive, from what I witnessed before cutting my trip short last Thursday."
Many thanks x
"Just curious--if this illness is viral, have the staff become sick also? I don't remember reading about any sick staff members in this (very long) thread."
I'd imagine that's because staff members aren't supposed to post here -- their employer would be cool with the chambermaid confirming that half the staff got it! The problem is that DPB hasn't been forthright about what's going on there.
"I guess you can get sick anywhere, check link.travel.ca.msn.com/canadianpress-article.aspx…"
I just read that it sounds like the same thing that just happened on the Carnival cruise out 1800 passengers 350+ are sick.
"the resort seems to be updating on their facebook page. http://www.facebook.com/DreamsPalmBeach and they have also updated their original statement of their open letter.They really do seem to be doing all they can, which can only be a good sign :)"
"Coughcandy - I don't know if you can access your link if you're not a registered Facebook user. If you are not a member of Facebook, here is what was said on their Facebook fan page:An Update on the ResortShare Today at 2:13pmAt Dreams Palm Beach Punta Cana, we place the safety and security of our guests as our highest priority. This philosophy is more than mere words. As reports of illness at the resort were recorded, we immediately intensified cleaning, sanitation and disinfecting protocols from our already stringent standards. This past weekend, we invited the Ministry of Health and independent health and safety inspectors to evaluate conditions at Dreams Palm Beach Punta Cana. We are pleased to inform you that these independent inspectors gave the resort a clean bill of health in all areas. More importantly, no new cases of illness have been reported in three days. All strict sanitation protocols, as previously outlined here: http://tinyurl.com/yfv4b7w, will remain in place.We will continue to closely monitor the health and safety of Dreams Palm Beach Punta Cana guests and thank you for your ongoing support. Any questions or concerns should be directed to info.drepb@dreamsresorts.com. This information was also posted on their blogspot:…wordpress.com/2010/…"
"I posted the cruise ship link around 7:30 this morning. It can and does happen anywhere. I picked up Giardia, an intestinal parasite, while in Punta Cana a couple years ago. Sick for 3 months after being home. 60% of our group of 30 were ill at that resort. Many others were sick also.Take precautions, carry wipes, hand gel, use toilet liners if available, line seats with TP if not, use TP to flush, use papertowel to open bathroom door, use napkins to handle utensils in buffet lines etc.I use ALL of the above precautions now when I travel AND at home. My DH was home last week with a nasty cold. I have NOT gotten it!!! I wash my hands at least 20 times a day & always have a tube of B&B antibacterial lotion by my desk/chair.Please try to enjoy your vacations!!"
"We just got back from Dreams PB. I got sick for 24 hours, but none of my other 3 companions got sick. I'm pretty sure my sickness was due to over indulgence and over activity as the only symptoms I had were lack of appetite, weakness and diarrhea every 2-3 hours. No vomiting or fever.It was interesting to read that DPB reported the health inspector dropped by because I think we saw them at the buffet looking around during lunch one day. From that day on, they placed the serving spoons for most of the hot items on the other side of the counter so that you could not serve yourself which I thought was a good precaution. They also provided everyone with bottled water instead of serving filtered water from a jug.We had a great time at the resort despite the scary reports of sickness we read. The resort certainly was not filled with sick people vomiting all over the place and, had we not read about it earlier, we wouldn't have known there were so many people ill. We were a bit more cautious than we probably should have been as we only swam in the ocean (not the pool) and we were careful not to brush our teeth or drink from the faucets. We did eat (and enjoy!) everything at the buffet and all the restaurants including seafood, cheese, deli meat and fruit.We would definitely go back again."
"wilsnip,Glad to hear a normal post about the overall resort . Not discounting that some people got sick and are upset but the virus is everywhere right now. At least Dreams is taking precautions to stop any spread of sickness. I would have no problem going there but would be cautious just like I would traveling anywhere right now."
"Thanx wilsnip, great post to put our minds at rest....Dreams here we come!"
"Wilsnip!Thanks for posting! Sounds like things are back on track!Raff, enjoy your vacation and please come back and tell us all about it!Happy Travels!bb/mt"
"I'm here. It's ok.Been here since saturday, and one person in our group of ten reported sick.Have not seen any clue of widespread illness.This place rocks.MICool"
"Hey Rob!So nice to ""read you""...Thanks for popping on to report in!Now go and continue to enjoy your vacation!Happy Travels,bb/mt"
"""Not discounting that some people got sick and are upset but the virus is everywhere right now.""Really???? can you tell me what other resorts have issues at present?Aside from the resort right next door....none. Best not make blanket statements that paint an inaccurate picture.CheersPCMike"
"No Mike, If you look at the seasonal flu stats around the would right now the flue is picking up and becoming a very bad flu season. The virus is everywhere if you do you checking. I didn't say other resorts, I said everywhere. Best to have an accurate picture!"
"Still here. Still alive. yes a few in our group have been ill. One day, belly ache, poopy, little vomit. Next day pretty good.For me I have been great. (other than self induced injury) If you are coming soon, come on down and I wish you the best. Mention Roberto from Michigan and you will make instant friends with the staff.Adios Roberto"
"BB....I agree with you, but the issue running around (hopefully passed now) is a bit more severe than the everyday northern flu. This has been isolated to the resort and it's neighbour and I guess what I am saying is that on a forum specific to a destination, your general statement can be taken as on that refers to Punta Cana...not the world.This is not the first nor the last resort that will have to deal with a major health issue...as long as humans are human. Unfortunately....for big companies that seem to have all the right answers and promotion when times are good...they become non existant when things go bad...along with their flag wavers.Unfortunately when a resort has a high exposure level through guest support and social networking pages, when the s hits the fan, they have to be as active...if not more active than when things are good. What I found interesting is that AMresorts has (or had) an official representative who participated regularly on all AMresorts forum postings....but as an official spokesperson...seemed to have all but vanished when the heat was on. Go figure!I really hope that for the sake of the people visiting...not the owners and rabid supporters, that the illness issue is behind them. Thanks BBG for clarifying your blanket statement.CheersPCMike"
"Thanks for the postings Mike!It is nice to see someone trying to keep this impartial and true to the facts.We are a party of 11 (unfortunately you were all booked up for a tour...) that are booked for DPB on March 6th. We are trying to get Westjet Vacations to book us elsewhere but are running into the wait and see game.I have emailed DPC to see if they will rebook us there and I have emailed the Canadian Embassy in Punta Cana to see if they are aware of an issue at DPB and what they are doing about it.We are so looking forward to doing our first trip with the kids to a tropical area and I am utterly dissapointed so far that I have been watching the reports go downhill. I hope that we can get this resolved and spend our week in paradise without wearing a mask and gloves the entire time.IF the reports are true, I feel that it would be irresponsible as a parent to knowingly bring our 2 kids and a 6 month old infant to a resort that has such documented issues.I am trying anything in my power to resolve this and any other input and information is greatly apprecatied!Cheers,fun4allCanada"
"Wow, just back from a week in Jamaica 'sandals dunns' and what a difference in hotel atmosphere, nobody is on the panic like dreams, it's now been a month that people are sick at dreams and the hotel is still open for business as usual, the hotel doctor is getting very rich at 200 dollars a pop. Change hotels even change countries."
"Rush, I agree! Illness can happen anywhere, however it is all about how this resort has handeled the problem."
"Back from Dreams PBTen people went. Three got sick. One probably the ""virus"". The others not so sure. My wife and myself never got sick. Never andy ""bathroom"" issues...(poopie). We did take acidypholus pills.Heard of a few cases of the sickness, but did not see or hear of a mass epidemic while on our stay..This is a beautiful resort with the best staff I've encountered.Rob"
"fun4allCanada,Did you manage to get a booking elsewhere? I too am in the same boat. Will be at Natura on Mar 5 with my 2 year old. I have saved all year for thsi trip and can't afford to cancel. At the same time, like you mentioned, it would be irresponsible to knowingly take my 2 year old there."
"hi sweet november. I was at natura three weeks ago and my husband did get sick for one full day. I on the other hand was absolutely fine. Later today my husband will be finding out if he has next week off work. If he does we will be leaving on either friday or saturday to return to the area. We budget our travels so that we can take off frequently like this..so we stick to the best deals we can get...that being said..we will probably see you at Natura Park! It is a great little resort, and I am looking forward to it for the forth time in the last 13 months!CheersLynn (not so patiently waiting for hubbies call from work!)"
"This doesn't seem to be going away. The latest on facebook is from a woman who returned today and states. ""I want to be clear that the resort is awesome! and they are doing EVERYTHING that they can do to stop the spread of this!...... but it is VERY MUCH STILL THERE AND IT IS NOT DECREASING!!!! dont be fooled by people who say it is. ....... we were optomistic at first......then you hear of the sick ones..... they are bed ridden for a day or two if lucky...... but then they venture out to get some fresh air and sun...... and they contaminate the areas.... Dreams continues to say that there have been no new cases since February 20th and that they will have another statement this afternoon."
"Hi Sweet_november21,I am sooooooo glad to say that my faith in Westjet vacations has been restored and we are going to Dreams Punta Cana now!!I am sure that DPB is doing all they can and it sounds like they are on the right track but I am not willing to take the risk.I have been in contact with the DPB by email and they have been very helpful with all my questions. Still not enough to make me feel that the grass is not greener on the other side!As others have posted, be vigilant with your tour operator and they will change your hotel.Cheers and I can't wait to get to DR on Saturday!!!!!"
*fun4allcanada*Which email address did you contact DPB on...they aren't replying to any emails I send?
"We arrived home saturday the 27th from Dreams. If there were a mass disease down there, we did not see it. One in our group of ten got sick, and two others under the weather, but that probably because of too much drinky, drinky.Some are so worried about getting sick, it's almost a certainty you will because you almost expect to get sick the minute you arrive.I suggest to go elsewhere for peace of mind, but you will miss out on a great resort and staff. I was also worried, but came back in good health.Michigan"
"Just interested to see how your trip went after this ""sickness"" threat.We are leaving on the 9th of March"
"We are leaving on the 9th, was there any mention of this sickness issue?"
"Gregnlynn,I am off tomorrow. Taking my chances. Hope your husband gets the time off and see you there. Cheers"
"hubby got the time off, but we ended up getting the barcelo as sell off were only showing 5 day package for Natura Park for our dates..so we booked...next morning sell off had the 7 day package available again for Natura. Oh well. Don't know if I am disappointed that I will not be somewhere that I know so well..or excited to try another resort that we have not tried yet. Have a great trip sweet november, and tell Bruno in the main buffet that Lynn, Diane and Linda from Canada say hello (oh and Lynn's husband Greg too lol)cheers and off to finish packing!Lynn"
"sickness seems to be coming to a slow down at dreams, last few reviews seem to be getting very encouraging."
