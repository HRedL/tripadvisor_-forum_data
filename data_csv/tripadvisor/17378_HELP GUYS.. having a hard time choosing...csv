"I was ready to have a room reserved for me and my husband on this hotel but then i just got emails from the other hotels that got my interest and now i dont know which one to pick..beachcomber resort - not beachfront and no seaview for the room left on the dates of our arrival (we're in the groundfloor) and the package doesnt include roundtrip transfers to caticlanhey! jude hotel - not beachfront and no seaview but they got a room with a terrace for us, the package includes roundtrip transfers to and from caticlanvictory beach divers - beachfront and has a seaview room for us and i really liked their rooms but their package doesnt include roundtrip transfers to caticlanall of these are of the same price but i dont know which one to choose.. somebody please help.. thanks in advance for the replies.. :)"
"if your prob is just the transfers, you can go by yourself from caticlan airport to your hotel. tricycle from caticlan airport is 40peso good for 4 persons, then the government fees at the jetty port 70pesos, boat 20pesos to boracay, tricycle is 70pesos. thats one way...then you can choose the hotel you feel good about."
"If your only consideration is the transfers, don't worry. Getting to the island is really simple and you don't need special transfers. When you exit the airport terminal you'll be pretty much shepherded into a trike and onto the banca boat so there is no chance you will make a mistake.Go with the nicest hotel. Beachfront makes a huge difference. Jude hotel is quite nice and reasonably priced but it's not in a nice area, round the back of the mall. Its noisy and crowded."
"Thanks guys..Yeah, Hey jude hotel gave me a good deal, but problem is, all their room has 2 double beds. I want a room with one queen or king-size bed.. I also heard that there are no boat stations anymore and all boats are brought to CACBAN BEACH (im not sure if thats right)..Another choice is Jony's beach resort.. argh really confused.."
i've tried jony's rooms are clean and staff are great. you won't be disappointed. good luck 
"In order not to get confused, stick to what you have chosen. In July, the waves along the White Beach are physically powerful and the wind is strong as well. You will be lucky to be wading on the WBeach, or staring directly to the sea from the WBeach."
Thanks guys..Im down to 2 choices..Jony's beach resort and Victory Beach Divers
"Hi! Did you know that Jony's is right next door to Beachcomber? They are both just right across the road from the beach. Just cross the small strip road, and the beach is right there!I checked both of them before we decided to stay at Beachcomber last April.I liked Beachcomber better than Jony's 'cuz they are newer(a couple years old), with a pool, rooftop view, their own beach lounges right on the beach, and a cozy Beachcomber Spa(beachfront) right across their hotel.Also,they owned Beachcomber Bar just half a block away(across Andok's fast food).All their ground floor rooms have a porch with lounge chairs and a table. Also, they have 10 breakfast choices(5-Filipino, 3-American and 2-Continental). Their staff are just amazing!We really enjoyed our stay there!"
It's true that all boats now arrive at Cagban jetty port as opposed to boat stations 1-3. From there you have to take a trike or multicab to your hotel. In bad weather Tambisaan port is sometimes used. 
"Hi chiqbonez,for your transfers from Caticlan to Boracay, to be safe..the estimated cost from the jetty to your hotel will be not more than 600 pesos. This include the tricycle transfer from Caticlan airport to Jetty (which is only 3 mins away if u walk, environmental fees, boat fees and tricycle to your hotel (50 pesos per trip)."
Not more than P200 per person!
"Fellow posters,..when arriving at the airport...Unless you are infirm or hooked to oxygen save yourself some money and walk to the pier.First its better for your health.Second its better for your pocketbook.If you dont ...once you get to the pier you will undoubtably wonder to yourself""why did I take a cab..its such a short distance?""Rob"
"""Yeah, Hey jude hotel gave me a good deal, but problem is, all their room has 2 double beds. I want a room with one queen or king-size bed.. ""Ask them if they can replace the 2-double bed with one of your choice. They normally give in to your request. Let it not be a problem"
"I was disappointed with Beachcomber hotel.. My husband was emailing them and asking about infos about the hotel and other stuffs, but then they stopped replying and my husband took 3 emails more until he decided to give up on beachcomber, but then i tried to email them and to our surprise, they replied. I just wondered, do they choose their customers? My husband was very polite when he emailed them, i dont know what went wrong.As for Hey judes, I already asked them if they can replace the 2 double beds with one king/queen-size beds but told me that they cant and every room has 2 double beds they cant do anything about it.Rob, yeah walking is good for health but since I am pregnant, although walking is good for pregnant women, I prefer to just have a ride to the port coz I hate it when I sweat a lot, and it doesnt really look good when I do.. Lol"
It's not pleasant to walk from airport to jetty port in the hot sun carrying heavy luggage. Who's too tight to pay P30 for a trike?
"Don’t worry about sweating. All mammals sweat. You don’t look good while sweating? No problem, all those who come to Boracay agrees to sweat one way or another.(its becoming an epidemic)"
"Hi,chigbonez!Just wondering, when Beachcomber stopped answering your husband's email, was it during and after the typhoon?My sister who's booked at their hotel for Aug. did'nt get a reply for a week. She just got an email recently and found out that their reservation office is being handled in Kalibo where they have their other Beachcomber Hotel. As you know, Kalibo was badly hit by the typhoon and they did'nt have any electricity there(not sure whether it's backed now). Anyway, their reservation office just relocated on Boracay, and that explained for the delayed of not answering my sister's emails right away, so it might be the same case as your husband."
"my husband sent the 3 last emails to beachcomber after the typhoon, and almost all the hotels we emailed, mailed us back already.. before he sent the 3rd last email, i first emailed them using my own address and they replied.. and my husband never got a reply from them.. i dont know.. maybe because my husband refused to take their honeymoon suite room which they are offering us and hubby asked about the room infos about the lower class rooms instead..we didnt have any problems contacting jony's and victory resort.. we get replies after 20 minutes and with complete details.. another hotel emailed me, milflores resort.. but i guess we'll end up staying at jony's.. :)"
"Hi chigbonez,Maybe because Beachcomber were the only one whose office is in Kalibo(which were flooded during the storm)thus explained not answering their emails sooner. Did your husband got a reply right away when he first sent emails before the typhoon? When I was doing inquiries last time I went to Boracay(Apr.), they were the first hotel that replied. My sister have the same good experience with them, that's why she decided to stay at Beachcomber next month(also due to my glowing recommendation..hehe).I believe that Jony's, Victory Resort, etc., their reservation office are in Boracay, which explains their quick replies after the typhoon since they were not affected that much(unlike Beachcomber which is in Kalibo).Anyway, hope you find a place that will make you happy and cater to your needs.Try ""ARIEL'S HOUSE""(across Club Paraw and next to Cocomangas in Sta.1 and walking distance from Jony's & Beachcomber) for their good afternoon happy hours and relaxing enclosed huge air conditioned restaurant and bar. It's the most relaxing place we've ever been....so comfy big lounge sofas and good house soft music(reminds you of home). Also loved their appetizers-""chicken lollipop and mozzarella sticks"". They also have good fruit shakes and imported brewed coffee. We were there every afternoon just lazing around and just ordering some of their yummy appetizers, coffee and shakes(always stayed there for hours and at one time, just dozed off due to their calm and soothing atmosphere).Enjoy Boracay! =)"
"By the way, one good thing about ARIEL'S HOUSE, they don't rush you after a bite or two. You can even just order a cup of coffee, read their newspaper or watch their big screen TV and stay there for hours just sitting in one of their big sofas....or you can even wander out into their nice swimming pool/garden area(their hotel is located right there-Boracay Beach Club) and have your drink in one of their gazebo. It's really like a home away from home....that's why they called it Ariel's House(after the owner, a real nice ""teddy bear""...hehehe...we met him and just fell in love with him! Real nice and down to earth guy). The place is open from morning till dawn! It's also a family owned hotel and restaurant/bar. Take care and have fun!!!!"
"regarding beachcomber, they are already sending replies after the typhoon, which i proved when i emailed them using my own email add.. they just dont like to email back to my husband i dont know why.. until now, hubby havent received the reply from beachcomber yet while i already asked a ton of questions and they happily mailed me back..Hmmm Ariel's house,a really must-try resto i guess.. :D i'd surely visit them and try their appetizers and coffee (i love coffee).. :D"
"Boragaia,Its not about being tight or loose.No need to worry... I can well afford the thirty pesos. Of course for some people a few hundred feet will seem like a mile.....especially in the hot tropical sun...but of course if you are lucky you will always find a cold refreshment and someone to carry your bags....I will rephrase my post...for all of you with 4-6 bags for a week long trip to Boracay hire a trike...for all of you who do not like to sweat/even a trickle...hire a trike...for all of you who dont mind a short three to four minute walk...walk...dont worry you will line up anyway at the pier anyway..ie (you will meet the trike people there)..as for our pregnant poster...my dear of course you should take a trike...in your condition...if you should choose to do so...ehghads....I didnt realize how passionate people were about trikes and how one could be characterized as cheap by suggesting a short healthy walk...yet I stand by my comment that it really is a short distance for a trike ride...(regardless the fee/amount)I will surrender and declare peace now...lolRob"
"Rob,I dont know how to translate in proper English idiom but ""the more you feed an amber, the more it crackle"".Peace, man!"
Amen.............case closed!
