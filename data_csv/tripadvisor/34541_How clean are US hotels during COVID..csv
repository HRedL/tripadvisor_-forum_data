"I read here about hotels and motels in the US using ""enhanced"" cleaning during COVID. So road trippers should be less worried staying at hotels along the way. However, this Inside Edition report says otherwise. Sure, the sample size is small, and only for NYC, but still worrisome.https://www.insideedition.com/investigation-…"
"I read the article - 3 hotel rooms in one city out of the millions of rooms in the US. Please - that is very spotty. Last year I spent over 10 weeks in hotel rooms. The cleaners have a lot of work to do with limited time and limited resources. I always wipe down things myself. Like the remote, and some of the bathroom. Never assume glass dishes are clean and always toss the bedspread off asap. And never use the coffeemaker. Common sense will always go a long way."
Inside edition has a tad credibility issue in its reporting bias.National chains have reputations to hold too. Same with hotels near national parks. No name or low level brands likrly have more issues.
"I cannot access the linked article owing to geographic region license limitations. However, if it's the one I am thinking about where they tested sheets with UV visible markers, then it's been doing the rounds for a week or so. Whether it's true or not, I don't know. Whether it's truly representative of most individual properties, I don't know.Brand can mandate enhanced cleaning all they like - and advertise this fact - but at the end of the day it's up to each properties own management and the actual staff who do the cleaning, and human nature, at the end of the day. I've always had my suspicions about many hotel chains' cleaning standards but I don't dwell on these things. If I did, I might never leave my front door ......SWT"
"That's one of the reasons we prefer travelling with RV. I clean it after take-over, and than all the following dirt is from our selfes. ::))"
"What are the chances the Inside Edition got the same hotel room after checking out? And in 3 hotels. I can believe there are some hotels that are unclean and agree about the bedspread, I doubt they wash those after every guest. However I have always seen maids stripping beds in every hotel I have stayed in. I agree with doing some of your own sanitizing of the remote, wiping door knobs, faucets, etc. Because even tho the maids wipe things down I am not sure how clean their wiping cloth might be from room to room. I NEVER drink out of the glasses. Only paper cups that are sealed or I bring my own bottle water. Reise, we like to RV too but its not always practical in larger cities and some mountain areas. Especially for those who have never done it. But if social distance is what you want then campgrounds give you that opportunity and it is your own germs you are living with."
"""""Reise, we like to RV too but its not always practical in larger cities """"""Oh yes, I know. Therefore we never visit big cities, only your breathtaking nature. But unfortunately Covid makes it impossible for us for the next month."
"Beate....Covid should make it impossible for all of us here until we get it under control. I have never cancelled a road trip until this year. It's the safe and responsible thing to. Three months ago the EU and the US were at 27K daily cases. Now the EU is well below 3K and we are more than double at 55K! It's really flaring up all over the South. Our ""leader"" is saying we just have to live with it. We will for a time, then we will die with it. We have lost respect with the world and I'm angry. I look forward to the time when you, SWT, and others can comfortably visit here again. It makes me proud that you enjoy it here. Sometime I hope to again as well."
"That's why we come to sites like this - and hope that we can sift through the BS added by the individual businesses to ""puff"" their merchandise to find some accuracy that aids our decision making.Hotel rooms are rarely totally clean, and the comments above, even in the best of times, are truly valid about personal protection through spot cleaning. 20/20 did a segment years ago about hotel cleaning using hidden cameras watching housekeepers that was an eye-opener for many people. Best the traveling public can do is choose the best rated places and CYA with everything else.Ref. RVs - if a recent internet article is anywhere near correct, RV sales increased 10000% this year because of Covid. True, motorhomes are not very user-friendly around urban areas which is why most of us tow little cars on dollies behind to be used for sightseeing. Its not a lifestyle for everyone, however.Bottom line - use good common sense choosing hotel rooms and CYA always best you can."
"We actually ventured out to an airbnb about a month ago to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was about 2 1/2 hours away. The owner said to bring our own PILLOWS, which we did. Think about it: your face against a surface for hours with a thin single layer of fabric between you & pillow. YIKES! We also brought our own bedding. And Clorox wipes. And washed dishes before using them. Flung open the windows & sliding doors upon arrival. After my obsessive flurry of activity, I was fine. Enjoyed lakefront airbnb & takeout food & hiking for a couple days & are OK a month later. That was early June... sadly, things are worse now.On another note: I was a chambermaid one summer at a Holiday Inn as a teenager a hundred years ago. What a horrible job! And people can be pigs... be kind to cleaning people & leave a tip!"
People who have reported travel on the road trip forum have found Hilton brand hotels to be acceptable. At least this was the case back in April and May when snowbirds were heading north after winter in Florida.
"I cannot wait to buy a $80,000 used 5th wheel when we get back to the USA in a few years when all the ""hurry buy an RV"" people buy them on 30 year loans, realize that 30 years is a long time to pay off an RV, realize they owe more than its work and then end up getting them repo'd when they no longer want to make the payments. Then we scoop up a used one for $25,000 :)Edited: 11:41 am, July 07, 2020 "
"I'd assume every surface is contaminated and everyone you encounter is contagious and act accordingly. I'm a lot of fun at parties.  Really.  Bring your wipes, gloves and masks.  Bring your own pillows, dishes and utensils.  Get a first floor room to avoid stairs and elevators - choose a low rise hotel so there's no chance of a high floor room.  In our experience Hilton properties have been the cleanest but you never know when a housekeeper may have missed something.  Many Hilton properties (and probably some other brands) have an app where you can select your room and check in online, then use your phone as your hotel entrance/room key.  You can go in one of the side doors and avoid lobby traffic.Edited: 1:42 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"And, don't expect a breakfast buffet at any hotel. I know some are giving a breakfast bag in lieu of the beloved breakfast bar, but that's about it. I don't think breakfast buffets will be back for a long time."
"@martijewel...My sister used to live in Shallotte. One Thanksgiving about mid-meal, my BIL got up, went to the kitchen, got some Windex, and proceeded to wipe down the glass topped dining table. Never did like the guy."
"Eric, I am definitely more fun than your BIL.  I do not usually assume everything is contaminated and everyone is contagious!  Just these days...I still refuse to pronounce it sha-LOTE but I have adopted the local pronunciation of Whiteville as WAT-vul.It is hurricane season. The locals are so sweet. When you ask if they plan to evacuate they say Namaste."
"This is really just an advertisement from Hilton, but it explains the things they say they are doing to deal with Covid. https:/…"
"""How clean are US hotels during COVID?"" It varies. I can't believe that a sudden drop in business that threatens insolvency is going to make hoteliers spend more money on cleaning. Well run, profitable hotels may clean their facilities even better than in the past. Unfortunately, not all hotels are well run and profitable. Hotels that were dirty before the pandemic are probably still dirty. I still see complaints of dirty rooms and resaurants in my local Tripadvisor reviews. The good new is that surface contact is apparently not the way COVID-19 is spread. From the CDC: ""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads."" https:/…how-covid-spreads.html"
"I wouldn't say surface contact is not the way the virus is spread, but rather that it is not the main way.  I do believe the main way is contact with an infected person.Local restaurants are shutting down for deep cleaning after a customer or employee tests positive.  Our library says they are decontaminating books.  Nearby a woman who had been isolating except for a trip to a drugstore was informed by an epidemiologist that she was infected by a credit terminal stylus pen when she picked up her prescription.  I think in a scenario where an infected person sneezes or coughs on a surface, or touches a surface right after touching their nose or mouth (or eyes?), then another person touches that same surface and then touches their own nose, mouth or eyes, the risk of infection is high, but the two occurrences would probably need to be close together in time.I've wondered if the surface decontamination measures are overkill, more for public relations,  but I'm on the side of better safe than sorry.  So much is still unknown and unproven about this thing.I would hit the George Dickel but I'm afraid to go to the liquor store."
"Hot off the press... airplanes these days are cleaner and have better air filtration than your house.So go ahead and rent that filthy RV that little Johnny got carsick all over, and Mom left baby Marie’s dirty diaper under the front seat."
"marti @ 19 ""Our library says they are decontaminating books."" The library here has books in ""quarantine"" for 3 days after they are returned. That's a little concerning about the stylus pen."
"Moral of the stylus pen story: wash you hands after your trip to the pharmacy and don't touch your face until you have washed your hands.Eric, at least with the RV scenario you are familiar the likely provenance of Johnny and Marie's germs. Can't say that about that person next to you (or one seat away), across the aisle from you or behind you. Personally I am sticking to my own vehicle for a while.Edited: 8:22 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"I have a friend who used to work for a hotel. Now, when he and his family travel, he and his wife make the kids wait outside the hotel room while they clean it. He always puts the TV remote in a baggy (He said you don't want to know why).I honestly don't trust large hotels saying their cleaning standards have changed due to COVID. The maids still probably only have so much time per room for cleaning. Unless they're actually adhering to that 50% capacity rule and not renting the same room out on consecutive nights, I'll pass on traveling right now."
"I just stayed at a hotel last night that is a major player. I saw the maintenance man wear a mask, under his chin. not on his face. Saw the housekeeping cart and it didn't appear to have anything special on it - same old cleaning dusters that they probably used in the last room and the room before that. When I got home everything that is washable is in the laundry. Had to use the elevator - top floor. Too many stairs. Not happy with sharing the buttons with who knows who. The remote probably much cleaner than those buttons. : ("
