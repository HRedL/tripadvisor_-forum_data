we have a holiday booked in fuerteventura on the first day the flights start .june 17th what are the chances of any restaurants being open or will it be cancelled as we are unable to eat out ?
"Which airline thinks that flights here will start on June 17th?There's very little chance of that given that we are still in a strict lockdown here. The Canarian President wants a gradual relaxing of controls - he thinks that inter-island flights will be allowed first, the possibly flights from Spain in July and then international flights later.As soon as the flights come in there will be restaurants open but I don't think that some restaurants/bars that were here before will ever re-open."
"Andy, sorry to tell you this but your holiday in June won’t be happening. I also have a trip booked for 17th June but I’d be willing to bet a lot of money that it won’t happen. Lots of articles are pointing towards Spanish hotels reopening for domestic travel first (ie other Spaniards ) in June or July, and international travel from September or October. Even then, whether the Spanish choose to let Brits in, and whether our own government choose to let us out by then, is another matter."
"Those dates were only ever ""place holders"" and also a carrot to get folk to hand over their cash. They will be put back again nearer the time."
"Hello andy , as you will be aware the whole travel outlook does not look good.But however unlikely it looks today that tourists will be visiting there are 7 weeks before you go. Just over 6 weeks ago planes were still flying to spain full of holidaymakers, a lot has happened since then and a lot can happen before you travel, no one though can definitively say what the landscape will be moving forward.Atb steve"
"First of all lets hope the powers that be have the right precautionary measures in place before things veer towards something like normality. We have written off our July trip but will book for October as soon as there is an all clear, one trip we have booked however is 2 weeks in Barbados at the end of January (flexible), gotta be optimistic. :)"
"Hi Andyrobbo, I think tommoScotland is bang on the money with his earlier post, Argentina's government have stopped their airline's selling flights uptill 1st September because they're taking people's money without knowing if the flight will happen?...on a personal note we're waiting for a flight refund for boxing day, last year(Thomas Cook)..on chargeback (Halifax)..submitted 23rd Sept...and our Ryanair flights (should have flown Sunday)...refund requested 2 weeks ago?...I'll probably have to claim them back down the line when the adverts start coming out about being missold a ""flight "" like it did with ppi and endowments!..it's like them reselling an ""out of stock item"" not knowing when it's going to be delivered!...luckily we've only booked Nov's flights, which we did earlier in the year (can't see that happening)...on a lighter note would it help if we all held our breath as we walked past one another!...keep safe x"
"A lot of pessimism here.We went away on 1st March and the China virus was a somewhat distant thing as far as the UK was concerned.It was only mid March when things started to get serious in the UK and 23 March when 'lockdown' (that isn't really lockdown) started.An awful lot has happened in 6 weeks, so an awful lot can happen in another 6 weeks - especially now that we are over the hump and many countries are already easing restrictions.Economies will largely drive this and most countries cannot go on with restrictions and people not working for much longer."
"H0lidaymaker101-absolutely correct. The economy will drive the reopening of tourist locations as many locations & islands depend so much on tourism & the longer travel is restricted,the more smaller businesses such as bars,cafes etc will cease to trade.If that were to happen then these location hotspots would simply cease to appeal to many & people would simply go elsewhere.In short-money talks & places will reopen sooner rather than later but obviously when the risk is deemed minimal."
Australia have just reopened their beaches and Coronavirus cases have increased again.
"At #9, australia opened their beaches today, how can that at this stage be the factor in any increase ( if thats true) that could be reported ? incubation takes longer than that, did they test all the people before and after they visited?Edited: 6:14 am, April 28, 2020 "
"Hello mick, @alwayslookontebrightYou sure thats the right @ for you mate ?☺.Atb steve"
Regarding OP we were in Fuerteventura last two years ago and found those in our hotel on B&B were struggling in finding places to eat in the evening. A local told me many bars and restaurants had closed down as lots of hotels were now all Inclusive. So you perhaps you need to advise your resort.
"63joe-where did you stay? This apparent lack of bars & restaurants would not be applicable to Corralejo or even Caleta De Fuste. Obviously things could change soon given this health issue & it's effects on future business survival.We expect changes certainly in regards to Corralejo but still there would be more than enough bars,cafes,restaurants & shops there."
"For a dose of realism it's probably wise to read some of the comments under the Topic ""More hope than expect"". Digger is spot on (as usual) - how can an island which has managed to virtually avoid the virus to date realistically throw its doors open to countries with run away death and infection rates? It wouldn't just finish of businesses, it might finish off a large percentage of the population on an island with very limited emergency health facilities. We have lost two holidays already this year due to CV, I realistically expect our Greece trip in September to be under threat and even maybe our Fuerteventura trip in November. Whilst these places may be open by then, the mute point will be what state will the health of the UK be in at that time? We live in hope!"
"At#15 mainland spain has had/has itself runaway death and infection rates,so are they not just as at risk from visitors from national epicentres too like madrid or barcelona not just foreigners?Atb steveEdited: 12:28 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"benisteve….without doubt parts of Spain have had horrific figures and whilst death and infection rates are falling, they are still stubbornly high, so imho it would appear unlikely that travel from the mainland to the islands would recommence in the near future. I get regular updates from my daughter living in Ibiza and they have been advised by the local authorities to forget about a summer season this year which is having / will have a significant effect on theirs and other islander's businesses. I really hope I'm seriously wrong but I fear that travel and tourism is dead in the water for most of the remainder of this year."
"At earliest I can't see the UK back in Spain and canaries until at least November, I could wish for September has I have a holiday to Fuerteventura booked for then but realistically I think it'll be yet another of our holidays cancelled this year. If it isn't even 2020, well unless areas are desperate for UK holiday makers, who knows because once we brexit they can make up their rules to suit and we have no recourse"
