We may all need to be a little more vigilant with mosquito repellent. They are showing an increase in Guillain Barre syndrome in Puerto Rico (where they consider Zika to be epidemic). Just an FYI......may not be connected.
Autan available on Isla is an excellent skeeta repellent. Main issue is to remember to purchase it & use it early AM & evenings. :)
