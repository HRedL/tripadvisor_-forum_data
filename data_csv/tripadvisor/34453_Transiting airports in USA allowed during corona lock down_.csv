"Would any fellow travellers be aware of the Transit rules for the USA during the current corona crisis? Appreciate USA is closed to all travellers but what if just flying through?I'm coming from London, looking to transit through Newark ONLY, may be a 1 night stop over, before flying on to the Bahamas.It's impossible to get direct flights at the moment. Any help would be appreciated! :)"
"There is no such thing as ""transit"" or ""just flying"" through the USA. All incoming passengers go through US immigration. Thus they are essentially entering the country.So at this time you won't be allowed to board your flight."
"You will need to clear USCBP and go through security to get to your next flight. The US does not have a direct transfer option. You may want to read this.https:/…from-other-countries.htmlThe other option is to fly into Mexico and transit there.Edited: 4:01 pm, July 03, 2020 "
Until such time as the USA changes it's restrictions you wont be getting on a flight to the USA from the UK unless you are in of the exempt groups which is unlikely
"As the others have said, there's no real transiting the US. You have to completely enter the country, which means that you either need an ESTA or a Visa. If you're currently subject to the travel ban and you try to attempt to the US, if you have an ESTA it will be cancelled:https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/faq""Any traveler with a valid ESTA who is subject to the Proclamation and who attempts to travel the United States in violation of the Proclamation will have their ESTA canceled."""
With rising Covid cases I don't know why you would want to transit in the US!
If the US is closed to then I'm afraid that's that. It's probably better not to travel at this time in any case.
You'll need to find another routing that avoids the US.
"I'm surprised you can't get direct flights from London. But if that is the case, try transiting via a European airport where you can stay airside."
I'm surprised you can't get direct flights from London. - A quick check on Google flights for some random dates could not find any direct flights from London or any of the main European hubs.All options were at least 1 stop with a connection in either the USA or Canada - both of these are not an option at this point in time due to the current entry restrictions
"You might be able to get a flight through Toronto, although I am not certain if Air Canada has any flights to the Bahamas these days."
"You might be able to get a flight through Toronto - That's not an option given the current entry restrictions as per the UK Gov website""The Canadian authorities are now barring entry to Canada, including at its border with the US, to most foreign nationals, including British nationals.""https:/…entry-requirementsThis information could change at a future date"
"Thanks all! This was super helpful.With ALOT of effort, managed to avoid the US. Going over via Madrid coming back via Toronto.Transit through Canada is possible as Canada has a ""sterile transit"" process, i.e. as long as waiting in the transit area only and not passing through to Canada it is allowed:https:/…travel-restrictions.htmlSadly, USA does not have sterile transit, and direct flights from UK have not yet resumed :( Still, we got there in the end!"
"That's good to hear. Persistence has paid off for you! I didn't think of Madrid as a possibility for Barbados, I usually think of Madrid in connection with South America, so I've learned something there."
"Oh, I didn't realise. And I typed Barbados instead of Bahamas. I'm not having a good day :-("
"HiMay i ask who your direct flights to Cancun are with, and from which airport."
"Darren, when were you wanting to travel?"
We were no longer able to find direct flights from London to Cancun for dates we wanted - had with BA but was cancelled. Now having to go via Spain and Mex City with Aeromexico.Some airlines are recommending flights though so might depend when you want to go :)
"We are due to fly on the 10th September with BA.Our flight has not yet been cancelled, but is very unlikely to go ahead.I would have been willing to fly to Madrid then direct to Cancun but i don't think this is a option."
"Darren: it sounds to me like you have a different question likely worthy of a new thread.The more detailed your topic and discussion, the better we can help,you"
