Latest ban came from the mayor today 7/24. Too many illegal non compliant venues according to her. Who knows how long this will last.
Begins 6am 7/25/2020.
I saw this coming. Here’s the story. https://www.wwltv.com/mobile/article/news/he…
"LOL gotta love it! I can order and be served food from a window, but asking for that bloody mary is gonna get me dat WuHu Flu!Also, the state is letting people into the bars to play joker poker because they are losing that tax. I asked my bar owner friend if we can go in early to play our normal foursome on the golf machine and she] said ok."
This seems crazy. What's the difference from going to a liquor store? As long as you show your id what is the issue?
There were large gatherings outside the bars or in their courtyards without respect to social distancing and very few masking.
The issue is that people were gathering in crowds outside of bars on Bourbon St and elsewhere -no social distancing and many without masks. It is really sad that this will negatively effect small neighborhood bars where this wasn’t a problem.
Correct.. thanks Mac.
"I was watching the Cat's Meow camera on EarthCam the other day and there were about 50 people outside across from it. They had drinks, their own music and were line dancing. Not social distancing and very few masks.Edited: 5:44 pm, July 29, 2020 "
The crowd might have been on Saturday that you saw. There were places still selling alcohol to go on Saturday even after the ban went into effect that morning at 6am. Saturday night was very busy with lots of big gatherings in the streets but from Sunday on everyone was enforcing the new rules and I didn’t see any crowds anywhere from Sunday on.
There have been crowds every weekend since the bars were opened. It was really bad 4th of July weekend.
"""They had drinks, their own music and were line dancing. Not social distancing and very few masks.""Can't drink with a mask on.:))"
Depends on how often you gulp. ;-)~ Colleen
"LOL guys  i'd like them to enforce groups apart if they get drinks to go. no courtyards. No secret back room courtyard (looking at you '92 Decatur house). lol it should be no difference between people sitting at a table eating or some people standing around drinking.But as I said, I cannot get a drink to go with my po boy or chicken if I wished and that is just insipid.Edited: 11:31 pm, July 30, 2020 "
