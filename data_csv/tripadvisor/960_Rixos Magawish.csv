"Does anyone know when the new hotel ""Rixos Premium Magawish"" will be open or are the still constructing????"
Thanks for your information
"ClintG1 - if you do get any information on the new Rixos opening would you post it here? I'd really lijke to check it out. Maybe during Ramadan 2021 (covid permitting) Before the lockdown I think it was due to open in late September... so depending on how long the workers weren't working.... I can't possibly seeing it opening before Christmas, and that's probably highly optimistic."
"thanks Clint. we usually stay in Rixos Sharm, staying in Rixos Seagate in Sharm for 3 weeks.... but I heard the beach at Hurghada where the new Rixos will be is supposed to be very nice. That's the one thing I miss in Sharm... it's a few 100 metres knee deep till the reef, then it's like walking off the edge of a cliff into 25m deep. Not so struck on that, haha. Is the beach up that way as nice as they say?"
"no it's not the Makadi Bay one I was thinking of going to, it was the Magawish one.... and I heard the beach there (Magawish) is very nice. it's been 24 years since I have been in Hurghada so have no idea where these places are... maybe I should start by looking at maps, it has probably changed quite a bit (haha - probably won't recognise it) Thanks anyway Clint, much appreciated."
