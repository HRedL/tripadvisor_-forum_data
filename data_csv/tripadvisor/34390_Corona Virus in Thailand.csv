"Dear Travelers,I will be traveling to Thailand tomorrow but heard that, corona virus also spread out there. Does anyone knows anything about it? This would be great if anyone helps me to know the recent updatesRegards Tawseef"
"No, we're all idiots"
Look at previous threads on this topic.
where?
On this forum....where do you think?
couldnt find. some have being removed by tripadvisor
The replies are still there......
NO those were remoed. checked several times. I guess this post also will be removed soon. What is the point of removing. this is a travel forum where we ccould ask questions
"Removed...why ?2 thoughts, first being, for profit site an tourist industry, so don't want to scare the baht away.Other thought, removed thinking people have more intelligence than to ask repetitive, stupid health issues questions on a travel forum.Considering your replies.......refer to reason # 1."
Stay home.

"The coronavirus doesn't have a vaccine and slowly develop unlike SAR bench marked at higher bar as rapidly develop as a lethal weapon. I am not a medical expert or have background but I did many research and homework done and continue to do so as my traveling is ahead in second week of Feb to Vietnam and Thailand; I am nervous as anyone is but the good news is that is preventable;try to stay the side of healthiness such stick with cooked foods, minimize street foods, drinks plenty of water/juices, wash your hands often, stay away from sick/coughing ppl. Bottom line is stay healthy and keep boosting your immune systems that is the best medicine. A key difference between the flu and the Wuhan coronavirus, however, is that the former has a vaccine. Simply having the choice about whether or not to receive a flu shot can give people an illusion of control. The last not least, i would avoid traveling with kids and/or 65’s as considered vulnerable. And pack some medicines for fevers, coughs, nose masks, hand sanitizers.....Again, I am not a med expert,... do consult with your physician before any travelings. Good luck and safe travels!"
"Apologies for the rude comments in here.Anyway, I wouldnt worry as long as you dont eat any Chinese people :-) You would have more chances of getting hit by a Motor bike, car og get electrocuted by falling power wires than getting Corona.Enjoy your stay !"

"I have a hard time taking any of these viruses serious.SARS infected 8000+ and < 800 deaths That's less than 3 weeks tally on Thai road, this year, a slow year.MERS infected < 2500 and 850+ deathsCorona (2019-nCoV) .... 1300+ infected and all of 56+ deaths so far.Mosquitoes killed 1 million last year.Suicides, shy of 800,000 every year, one every 40 seconds. At least 5 people died while I typed this reply, at their own hand. More by mozzy bites..Corona..........PLEASE, don't make me laugh."
"Yes but if you're confident you're not about to kill yourself you can strike suicide off your list of concerns and not worry about being one of those 800,000 so that point is completely irrelevant. Why even mention that as a potential threat?"
ain’t nothing to laugh about being sick or died by any causes.... please have a decent human dignity.
HiMore tourist commit suicide than you realize in Thailand. Many come here with dreams and fantasy than when they lose all their money. they end it. It is as real as threat as any virus.
"Wow, harsh replies. A valid concern worth answering. It is a new virus and can have devastating effects on the elderly and immune compromised. Having said that the Flu virus kills more people every year. Use precautions and common sense, yes, by all means. Also contact a health centre for more advanced solid knowledge."
"Just chuckling at the hysteria and concern people are showing. Catching this, and any flu type virus is the least of any concern for myself, disease wise. Chance of getting infected, minimal. chance of dying from it.........well, better chance of being hit by lightning, or bit by a snake and dying.About 20 threads started already, and surely 20 more to come.Goes beyond silly. Borderline hypochondriac behavior.Really shows the total ignorance and lack of intelligence of people."
Hithe immune compromised are those that take antibiotics like candy use antibacterial products and demand a sterile world.. for those who have bought into western medicine it is a real and valid threat.. When this is over there will be another threat in a year or so when that is over another until maybe one day. we screw up and make a disease that does wipe out the total population. Until then I can't be bothered by minor threats like this one
"Out of curiosity...........holly crap:""About 30 people die of snake bites in Thailand while 7,000 get bit""""According to the National Lightning Safety Institute, 171 people have died after being struck by lightning in Thailand.

"Some facts about the coronavirus in Thailand:8 infected 7 patients are Chinese and 1 is ThaiAll of the Chinese patients flew here from WuhanThe Thai woman had been to Wuhan.4 Chinese and 1 Thai have now been discharged3 Chinese are still in hospitalNone of them were presumably infected in Thailand. Even if they were, with 800000 visitors to Thailand per week a visitor‘s chance of getting infected would be 0.0000001%. It’s more likely that you would be struck by lightning."

I'd be more concerned about the air.....555
I am in Surat Thani. Hardly anybody is wearing a mask.
How's the general atmosphere there guys? People seem to worry?
In short nobody gives a ****.I say the virus they say what virus.

Maybe the OP (Tawseef Karim) will have the decency to return with an update since he must be in Thailand now.
Now 14 cases reported in Thailand!
Ya. The latest 6 cases are all Chinese and 5 of them are from the same family. Seriously these are the high risk groups

#58Aren’t you supposed to have arrived in Thailand today ?Good luck....
"To put it in perspective, as a Yank, 5 cases of Corona in the MSM headline news..........and yet, this is basically ignoredhttps:/…preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm"
The virus was started from Chinese people eating snakes
HiPost #61 5555555 and you wonder why no one takes you seriously what a buffoonIt actually started by Chinese tourists getting a taxi from departures not arrival at BBK per your instructions.
"you sure it wasn't the bat soup......555Aliens or Big Pharm created.....be scared, be very scared."
https://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/easy/18…
"In China, the reported number is 7000 infected. Some experts say 100,000 are infected. Looking at the overseas number, it is definitely possible"
very funny
"Most likely your own handphone device is with bacteria attached, more filthier than a toilet seat if you are not cleaning it on daily basic. That should be more alarming than Coronavirus."
"We just got back from Bangkok-Singapore and Bali. Just practice good hygiene. Wash your hands often, don’t touch your eyes/face and enjoy yourself."
"Now that you are there, what is going on? I am to leave in 36 hours to Bangkok and Phuket. Wondering what someone there thinks, not just USA media info. THanks."
Business as usual. Just a lot of folk wearing very cheap masks which probably do very little to combat either the virus or the bad air.Now in Chiang Mai and Google tells me AQI 170 !!
Well that sucks.....Be Safe
Cheers Loki....and AQI in PKK? I will be there for a few days in March.

How was your experience? Is it safe to go?
Bkk. No good. My Thai wife says. Mi Di. No good. BKK. International airport. No go. Ding dong.
What does your other wife say?
#93....surely a typo - should read ‘ting tong’
We're saved!
We were in Bangkok for 4 days last week. We were a little apprehensive about going but we are so glad we did. Just practice basic hygiene routines. We didn't wear masks but used alcohol gel to clean our hands regularly and everytime we got on the BTS and in taxis etc. Just try not to touch your face without cleaning your hands first. Go enjoy Bangkok it's an incredible city we were sad to leave.
