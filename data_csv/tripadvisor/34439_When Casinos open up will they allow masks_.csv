I'm sure most of you know the casinos don't allow anything covering your face. Even on Halloween they don't allow masks. Casinos like to see who are entering for safety and security. How will they change and deal with it?
I’d never go to a casino wearing a mask even if it’s allowed.
Should have been more specific. Meant surgical or N95 masks.
"In Macau the casino customers must wear masks and have their temperatures taken before they enter. Eyes will still be visible with masks, unlike with Halloween masks that normally cover eyes."
"Depends when they reopen, they probably will not reopen until a vaccine has been approved, they are not essential,"
"they probably will not reopen until a vaccine has been approved, they are not essential - If the criteria for a non essential business to reopen is that a vaccine has been approved then I suspect the USA will be in economic meltdown before casinos reopen.There is always a balance to be made between the health of the individual and the economic health of the nation."
"If they have to wait for a vaccine, they won’t be open anymore."
I wouldn’t be surprised if trump opens the flood gates May 1. This won’t be vaccine related but economy and election related.
Well it would be nice if a vaccine was not too far off.
They will have no choice but to allow masks if they reopen anytime soon...
"""Well it would be nice if a vaccine was not too far off.""A Vaccine at the earliest might be ready in 12 to 18 months and that would be rushing it. Vaccines normally take significantly longer than this to bring to market."
"IMHO, I think face mask wearing will be insisted on.The value to nose and mouth covering, is to reduce the transmission of the virus from exhalation, whether it be coughing or sneezing, and there's mention also that moist breath can transmit the virus.Surgical-type face masks seem as effective as N95 masks for protecting against the virus in public.Spain has recently relaxed its lockdown, and face masks are being handed out at subway stations.Considering how vulnerable dealers are to coughing, sneezing from players at their table, anything that can limit their exposure to this will be beneficial.Face masks may also reduce the separation requirement for social distancing."
Now is the time for some industrious person to invent a see-through mask.
"I'm with KC, not going to wear a mask in Vegas. Fact is they don't work unless used properly and it makes zero sense to be forced to use one in a place you can eat, drink, smoke, whereby you have to remove it. Let's not forget security concerns and the simple fact they make it much harder for people to breathe which will be hell to wear in 110 degrees temperature and utterly stupid at the pool.My goodness, it is getting ridiculous. The CDC didn't recommend them last month ""because science"", now they do, ""because science"" all the while the WHO doesn't, "" because science"". It's gotten so ridiculous that some random scientist says we need to be worried about virus spray from ocean waves or virus on the soles of shoes. Look Chicken Littles, if you are so scared of the world, stay home. Stay home as long as you want, just don't force the rest of us to exist in your personal hell. The cigarette smoke wasn't worrysome, neither is what alcohol does to your liver, the flu, outbreaks of legionnaires disease in the hotels, MERS, STDs from your nigtly entertainment, and Heaven knows what else doesn't bother you, but a simple variation on a virus we've known about for years that kills as a percentage a miniscule part of the population is the worst thing in the world. If walking around Vegas like normal is too scary, perhaps try Disneyland, let the risk takers have their fun."

"Some people have little patience, and that can be understandable. I think in some cases, it depends on what kind of home you have. If you have a lot of space, it is much easier to persevere during this pandemic. A workout room, home studio for guitar, a home theater, all certainly help. Many people are so anxious to go back to a Vegas that might be disappointing when it is at much less than full strength."

"@DTCIf that is true, and the CDC, which has been around for decades hadn't figured that out then we are all totally bleeped because that is gross incompetence. They can do a study, the CDC can do one, the WHO, the NFL, the CIA can, I can put one together even. They could all be different. Basically every single major expert study on this virus, that medias and governments have used, has been dead wrong. If anything it has tracked far far closer to what I have been saying all along. My mistake was slightly under estimating projected deaths, though when you add in ones from Nov-Feb that weren't counted, and subtract the wrongly added dead by C-19 complications that were added, it about works itself out. I also grossly underestimated people's reaction to this. I apparently I had far too much faith in humanity. I won't make that mistake again."
"So when those who pound their chests and say they won’t wear a mask in Vegas, get there, and are required to wear one, what will you do ?... go home? Stomp your feet and say it is your right to not wear one? .....You would not be able to food shop here, as it is required you wear a mask..lEdited: 11:44 am, April 14, 2020 "
"I think it's important to differentiate between Halloween-type masks that cover your whole face, and surgical masks that cover your mouth and nose. I can see surgical masks being allowed, but full face masks not allowed."
MN has a stay-at-home-order in which you have to comply.
"Before casinos were closed I noticed a few people wearing masks at South Point during my last visit. They were the blue medical looking masks, not home made or burglar looking. The casino was simply allowing it."

"I went to a casino in the state of Indiana, the last week of February 2020. There were some folks wearing masks. If masks will be required, it is my hope that folks will not be allowed to wear them at the casino cage. Employees should be allowed to wear masks."
"People are in their personal hell right now. Two of my wife's friends haven't left their apartment in a month. They refuse to even use the laundry room because they are afraid of contamination.

"And respectfully there are men and women right now stuck at home who have exhausted their savings, lost their jobs and have no hope. There are men and women who turned back to the bottle or needle because life being confined was too difficult. Finally, there are human beings who simply couldn't take it anymore and who put a gun to their head or took their lives in another way. Every death is tragic period, whether it is the op's friends, someone sick from the virus or someone who merely dies of old age. However, if a person wishes to avoid the virus all they have to do is stay inside, which is clearly what many people want. You can choose to stay home, you aren't being forced outside. Others are being effectively forced to be indoors or forced to don masks which are uncomfortable and have at best a negligible benefit. People make a concious choice to go out in a busy, dangerous world every day. Today or tomorrow is no different."
"Here’s my opinion that no one cares about. What makes everyone an expert here? Watching CNN? When I go to Vegas very soon, probably for July, I will wear a mask if required or if I feel like it. As far as face coverings I SAW all the all the time Asian people with surgical masks playing slots. Also middle eastern women. Just remember Vegas’ decisions will money motivated like it should be. Also, I saw black jack dealers wearing surgical masks before. Chicken Little posts all the time here under so many different names."

"From my perspective, it is you who are being selfish. Perspective is everything.Ironically the same goes for politics or even what personal tastes in the drinks we like or games we play. I feel you are just as wrong as you feel I am."
"Is a hellish situation one is experiencing ever anything but 'personal' to them?If some people are finding that having to stay home for a few weeks is really comparable to dying a horrible suffocating death then they clearly have other ongoing issues in their lives, which staying at home may be bringing to the surface or exacerbating but probably isn't the underlying cause of their 'hell'."

Vaccines - they have said 12-18 months for 3 months. Shouldn't it now be 9-15 months?
"Look would I like to be sitting at Cheesecake Factory on their patio here in beautiful Denver weather right now?? Of course, I would. However, I'm staying home like a good girl. I do go out for groceries etc and I do wear an N95 mask.We are planning to go to Vegas in Sept. If it's required to wear a mask then I will because at least I won't be stuck at home. I'll be in VEGAS"
"One cannot say, unless you experience something personally, you'll never truly know. I hope I never have to. What I can say is that I see people turning down a dark path. This is like the 2016 election all over again. Only difference is now people hate each other over whether or not they want to stay home or believe this or that about a virus. People are afraid of each other almost for just existing or being in their space. That is terrifying. While this issue does transcend politcs, more often than not the ""home"" side is on the left, while the right is on the ""out"" side. That's interesting to me. For the record, I don't hate you or even dislike you. I strongly disagree with you on this issue at least. I just want what I think is best for the world, which inclides me. I'm sure you do too."
"Not sure who #49 is addressed to, but no hate from me either. Differing viewpoints/arguments on a very unusual and emotive subject (and that's alright) but yes we all essentially want the same outcome, and as soon as possible."
If people go back and read post #26 you can see that the “personal hell” comparisons were between people in quarantine. There was not a comparison with anybody with Covid. Attaching worst case Covid situations to that comment is unfair.
"The sky is falling, the sky is falling with Covid 19 droplets. You’ll be ok chicken little you good an umbrella and a mask. No I stepped in it it’s all over my shoes. Chicken Little, you won’t die, just wash your hands. But CNN said? Chicken little shut up and take your Xanax."

"I have not bothered to read the entire thread, so I might be repeating what someone else has already stated.Long before the St. Pat's Day closure of the casinos and other businesses in Nevada, a small number of people were wearing medical masks in casinos. Mostly Asians. With no pressure from the casinos. I had been seeing this for several months. Especially at Gold Coast."
"""If you practice social distancing and wash your hands, you will 100% NOT get this virus.""The above statement is not accurate. Reason is that when out in public, most of us eventually touch physical objects (door handles, chairs, money etc). Unless you immediately wash your hands for 20 seconds every single time you touch something, you cannot 100% guarantee you will not be exposed to the virus."
"I wish I could take the credit, but CNN stole the story from me. I am no better I stole it from someone else on this thread."

Life is full of risks we must mitigate what is reasonably possible and get on with it. I am not saying today or tomorrow but maybe the day after that."

KT and DTC. Thanks. I would consider both of them my friends but we weren't close. What hurts me is thinking what their families are going through now.

With respect to social distancing how far apart? Seems like 6 feet is good most of the time but not all the time. Many new studies are showing that. Aerosol transmission from speaking and breathing seems like it can travel much more than 6 feet.

Funny when you refute what someone posts with facts they say it's nit picking. Why? it's there own words. Science isn't hard.
