"If wearing a mask in Vegas while out in public is 'strongly recommended', will you wear one? Why or why not?"
"Nope. Not outside, not inside. Won't go in anyplace in Vegas that requires one. I'm willing to drive 100 miles round-trip to buy groceries in the next county over for just that reason. Only put it on when I absolutely need something local urgently and the store insists. If it's my favorite Mexican restaurant they don't make me wear it. Been going there probably 25 years so it's a courtesy. Wife only does it at work, but removes it in her office.Edited: 2:28 pm, May 12, 2020 "
Yes. I will slide it down while drinking and put it back up to reorder.
"If it's difficult to socially distance (6' separation), then I will wear one. In the open air, it's less likely to be the case.In the casinos, if the staff are wearing face masks, I will wear one. They are wearing face masks to protect the patrons from any virus they might have; it's a courtesy, then, to wear a mask to protect the staff from any virus I might have.On the bus, almost certainly, as everyone will be feeling the same way about not spreading the virus."
I will but I need to make a hole for drinks ;)
Vegas with masks? That's gona be an adjustment.
"“ while out in public”Depends what that means.Walking down the street? No. In a casino? Yes, especially if the employees are wearing them."
"I would. Although IAH I probably won't go to Vegas until they are no longer recommended.IMO 'recommending"" them is about as cowardly as it gets. If a business feels they are needed they should have the guts to require them. If they don't feel they are needed they should also have the guts to practice that opinion too."
"ktinca I complete agree with it being cowardly. Either require them and enforce the crap out of it, or don't.Then I will know which places I would be willing to go into without having to go in and survey myself."
exactly
Yes. I won't be going to Vegas or another casino until I don't have to wear a mask as I hate wearing them for longer than a half hour. It is to protect others and I won't be selfish in putting others at risk because I'm too obstinate to wear one.
"I would not. Was forced to wear a mask at Menards last week, and after shopping for about 30 minutes, I felt like I was going to pass out! Couldn't wait to get out of there!!!"
will you wear one? - YesWhy - Because it's easier to wear one than having to listen to my wife nagging me about not wearing one.

"Yes I would wear one when needed. Now I'd have to get some cute ones to match my outfits. But I won't give up my cocktails and a cig, so I'd prob have to pull it up and down."
"I would wear one, not a big deal to me."
Sure. Whatever they have to tell themselves to open things up. Although it will most likely be a cloth fashionable one.
Not until PotUS+ PMotUK do.
"Yep, Very Important Puss."
Lol. I might stop wearing masks until Destination Experts all wear them.
"Are they annoying and inconvenient? Yup. I've accepted the fact that some inconvenience will be necessary to re-open safely. So of course I'll wear one.Will they make some activities no longer worth it to me? Like drinking and gambling? Yup, so at least for me I won't do them until masks are no longer required."
"There will be the tough warriors who won't be wearing them. ""Have another beer; then you'll really be tough.""Edited: 4:53 pm, May 12, 2020 "
Absolutely will not wear one anywhere. Don’t let Fauci the fraud put the fear into you.
"Yes, I would wear one just like I do anywhere I go now. I’d rather find out later that it wasn’t necessary than end up being sorry for not following the precautions. Although, as others have said, I’m not interested in a Vegas vacation if we have to wear a mask. If we have to wear masks, that means there’s still a threat and I’m going to subject myself to the threat as little as possible. 13"
"Sure, I'll continue wearing them as asked, doesn't bother me.What does bother me us when people see me wearing a mask and they proceed to roll their eyes and shake their head at me. Why exactly does my wearing a requested mask to protect the health of others bother them so much?"
"Martha. I feel you have absolutely every right to wear a mask. Just like I have every right not to. However, I and, I would assume others who feel the same way I do don't look at masks as tools for safety but as shackles of oppression, conformity, and compliance. We do not believe that masks do anything significantly to protect you or anyone else. As I've said many times before, the CDC, WHO, etc have had the policy for years that masks aren't effective against respiratory viruses. They might have changed that policy, it doesn't change the makeup of the mask or the size of the viral particles. You say that people roll their eyes at you, well, you live in what I would assume is a more conservative town. Conservatives tend to agree with me on this issue. In left leaning Los Angeles, San Fran, etc. people would roll their eyes at me for walking around sans mask."
Same argument as wearing/not wearing a burkha then?
Good lord PnS. Good lord.
I agree with ttumaddawg..well stated.
"Probably. I understand the benefits, and it's a sign of respect towards my fellow patrons."
"For those people who go to Vegas who don't want to buy masks: Just go to your closet and take out those hideous polos and cut across about 8 inches off the bottoms. Use that to make your masks. Voila!Edited: 6:05 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"I would wear one. Not sure at all that it would help with Covid-19 spread, but it has certainly done wonders for my seasonal allergies."
I agree with dawg too. My feelings exactly.
The casinos should have a rule..simple... either they are required or simply not..putting the decisions on patrons will be a guarantee to cause all kinds of issues..
I agree with Jambo.
"Yes, i am going to sell bellecava style masks online."
"Heck yes I will. I don’t want to risk having the strip ever shut down again. But I am not sure how to drink a beer with a mask. I have had to wear one for work recently and they are so hot and uncomfortable. I always did respect those in the medical profession, but it sure went up a lot these last few months."
"""shackles of oppression, conformity, and compliance.""Let me translate that:""The other monkeys in my troupe will interpret it as a sign of weakness."""
"Calling me a monkey. Come on man. Who the hell am I trying to impress? I live in one of the most liberal cities in one of the most liberal counties in one of the most liberal states in America. The vast majority of people I know and who are my friends are liberals. It would be a lot easier to just shut up like my wife does and nod politely than to speak up. However, I refuse to ever be silent or to pretend I am something I am not simply to fit in. Far better men and women than I died so I could have that right."
"Yes. I am already feeling weird without one. Just like when getting used to the seatbelt (yes I am that old). After a while it felt weird driving without one. Then I heard stories of people getting hurt on a plane during turbulences. Now I am totally used to the seatbelt on the plane at all times, too. Same now with the mask. BTW, there was similar (and often heated m) debate around seatbelts when I was young."
"Shackles of Oppression?Cmon man!What is missing from many of these posts is an ounce of compassion for the dealers, waitresses, check-in staff who have to deal with the “what about my rights” crowd that doesnt give a s@@t about their health and safety.This isnt about how tough you are on the internet. Its about being unified so we can get through this. Im retired military. I dont recognize my own country."
"An ounce of compassion? I've been eating out a lot lately just to help keep local businesses open. I've been tipping at fast food restaurants now. I worked outside the home every single day until I was laid off, doing my best to keep things afloat. No one is being forced to go back to work at any place should they not want to. Respectfully while I appreciate your service to this country, that does not automatically make your opinions more valid than mine. You are right about one thing, I don't recognize this country either. By this point, I'd have expected people in the streets with torches, not angry that many of their fellow countrymen aren't being forced to be locked inside like prisoners for a few more months."
"Hard to imagine that we will have to go through this every time a new epidemic or pandemic comes along. Oh well,if we can save just one life. Right? Its gonna be hard to re-build the economy each time,but heck,this is America,and we can do it. Or,we may just have to say the heck with it and accept the deaths of 20-30 thousand people each year. Or more. Sure is gonna be interesting to see what the future holds."
"My decision to wear a mask is my own, and in no way hurts anyone if I do. My decision, my right. Might not be your choice, but that is also your right."
"https:/…This is such a divided issue and debates from all sides.I personally been wearing masks since beginning of the year as I am overseas in Asian country where masks wearing are widely encouraged and accepted. Results speak for itself as some of these places have very low infection and death rates. US and most of the West did not come on board to recommend masks wearing until much later. One wonders how much of the current statistics of infections and deaths could be lower if governments and publics embrace the idea sooner.This is not about personal freedom of being required to wear mask. Just as seat belts requirements and smoking restrictions in certain places--it's intended to save lives. Does everyone follows the rule, NO. But enough people doing it, the rate comes down.I wear them religiously during this uncertain time it's not because I'm whimpy. It's not only to protect myself but also love ones and people around me. Yes it's uncomfortable to wear especially hot weather is approaching. I would much prefer not have to wear it. But until proven medicines and vaccines become available, that's my choice."
"It must be exhausting to have to see everything through a political lens. If certainly is to have to listen to it.There isn't a liberal option to fight a pandemic, nor is there a conservative option. It is simply about using the facts available to make choices based on science. It's an imperfect process but it is the only option that will work.Those making it a political debate are doing it solely to justify their selfish behavior."
"While it could be considered a viewpoint issue, let's be honest, nothing is safe from politics. You honestly think a Democrat isn't going to do whatever they can to get rid of Trump? You honestly think Trump doesn't look at CA and see ""bottom of the list""? Neither is correct, BTW. Again, this goes along ideological lines not totally of course, but a conservative in South Dakota is far far less likely to want the government telling them what to do than a leftist in CA."

I’ve never been more grateful to be living in Canada.
"@Jenesaire ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you are in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better, and it might even block a droplet, it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.""- Dr. Anthony Fauci on March 8, 2020While science often isn't settled, there are cases where yes, it is. The Earth revolves around the sun, which revolves around the galactic center. Another 10,000 years isn't going to change that. The same masks being used in March didn't suddenly become more effective or block things only one way, nor did C-19 or any coronavirus for that matter mutate in any substantial way that made it larger and thus make the masks useful for containing it. If a government looks like it isn't doing anything to protect its citizens, people lose faith in it. I mean they should, with few exceptions it sucks, however, people perceive it to be doing something. Oh and in Asia, masks are basically a part of the culture in which people are highly germaphobic. Pollution in places like China is also a major issue. Note, they weren't mandatory, people chose to wear them. That might not be the case now with C-19, but do you really want to live under the laws of China?"
"#27 PnSfromLACorona virus size has not changed and most masks (except N95 and 3 ply surgical masks that are 95% VFE, BFE, PFE that offer better protection) are not helpful in stopping the virus particle itself to penetrate. So you are absolutely correct. However more and more studies have shown most virus particles are transmitted via droplets (cough, sneeze, even when talking loudly) which are much larger size and can be minimized by coverings of some sort both directions. Plus the fact that there's a percentage of population who are infected who are asymptomatic. So you never know who is passing the virus. Thus the change in recommendation by WHO and CDC and many others now.For example more and more airlines are requiring masks to fly and public transit to ride. That's not based on dictatorship, hysteria, deprivation of personal freedom."
What if they ask for ID but require masks and physical distancing. Not sure how you get by that and I get asked about 50% of the time in Vegas.
"They won't enforce it so ""strongly recommended"" is just a way for casinos to cover their butts.No, I won't wear a mask. I'm happy to social distance on my lounge chair by the pool during the day, play on a slot machine away from others at night, eat 6 feet away from you in the restaurant...but no, I wont wear a mask while I'm on vacation.IF Vegas does make masks mandatory, then I just won't go."
BTW Asian countries comprised more than JUST China. And there are plenty of them that's democracies like US.
"If these studies are just now being done, it makes me wonder the competence of the CDC , WHO, etc. Their old policy was policy for decades. While yes, a mask does block droplets, it doesn't block them all, and the simple fact is that because masks are uncomfortable people touch them constantly. This means they touch whatever is on the outside, be it viral particles from you or others. I doubt any of them are washing their hands. Talking doesn't spread the virus that far, nor does regular breathing. Coughing would which is why they were originally recommend for sick patients with symptoms. Not asymptomatic people. Couple all of this with a reduction in oxygen, a build up of carbon dioxide and no thanks. Happy to let someone wear one as much as they want. I'm not. Any yes, Asian isn't just China, but I wouldn't want to be under the laws of Japan or South Korea either, though I wouldn't mind Singapore's caning laws when it comes to certain types of crimes. Oh and we aren't a democracy, we are a republic.Edited: 9:10 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Look to Macau as they have a few months headstart on how to cope with C-19 just as Vegas will follow similar phases.Hotels, casinos, restaurants and businesses of all kinds would LOVE their places back to normal business activities pre-COVID19. But the reality is no place can afford or willing to risk having infection clusters started again at their business. That will shake the confidence of patrons coming back in.Thus the measures of temperature taking, thermo scanning, face masks, spacing out on patrons, hand sanitizers, more frequent cleaning, disinfecting etc. None of these are intended to offend patrons although I'm sure some will feel that way."
"It's funny in that while lack of certainly is a fundamental tenet of ongoing scientific research, that same lack of certainty is used by the dumb and selfish to justify their ignoring those same scientists.If a liberal from San Francisco and a conservative from South Dakota are both involved in establishing policy in dealing with Covid, that's all you need to know PnS in deciding who to listen to isn't it? We both know who you'd choose and that says a lot about you. For me I'd ask which one has the training and experience in dealing with infectious diseases and let that guide my answer."
"no, if others stay 6 feet from me and i stay 6 feet from them, we're not going to be spewing each other with our droplets. there will be disinfectant materials everywhere that i'll use before and after sitting anywhere. that'll be about 300X more effective than the face mask plan, which doesn't really do jack since people are disgusting and will be touching the insides of those filthy masks that they never wash and then touching bars/slots/tables/etc. again, disinfecting any area i use before and after using it is a much better way to keep myself and others safe so long as we all maintain the 6-foot social distancing thing. i understand requiring it on planes and public transit since even when they operate at reduced capacity, it's hard to get 6 feet away consistently and avoid those spewing droplets from people when they cough, sneeze, talk, etc."
"""If these studies are just now being done, it makes me wonder the competence of the CDC , WHO, etc. Their old policy was policy for decades""Science is an ever evolving process and COVID19 being a new virus is no exception. So it's not a matter of competency on the part of CDC, WHO. They have to be very cautious in making new recommendations, so often that will not be as timely as one likes.Old beliefs can be shattered. At one time in human history some people though the earth was square."
"When you constantly make mistakes, should someone be expected to take you seriously? What exactly have the experts been right about? What exactly is our government good at doing? I'll consider all sources for information. But let's be real here, any health official trying to talk about infections from San Fran, where the streets run yellow and brown with human waste, and there are more needles lying in the streets than people walking on them really doesn't have much of a leg to stand on. People are terrified of C-19 yet walking past a homeless encampment which could contain typhus or typhoid isn't a problem apparently. From my perspective the majority of things the left does are completely backwards, but then again, someone from the left probably thinks that about the right. Oh man this country is divided."
"I would have a mask on me; but whether I'd have it over my face would all depend on if anyone else was sitting close by where'd I'd be playing the slots. If I'm the only one (close by) playing a slot machine, then I would not wear it on my face, but would still have it along my neckline. However; if someone would sit down close by while I am playing, then I would def. slip the mask over my face. But if there were nobody playing within close range of me, I would lower the mask down along my neckline.If I am outdoors, most def. I will not wear a face mask; not unless (of course) there'd be hoards of people seen nearby where'd I'd be walking. But other than for that one particular reason, I won't wear a mask while outdoors."
"""When you constantly make mistakes, should someone be expected to take you seriously?""This statement says it all about your total ignorance how science works.  What exactly is our government good at doing?Let's start with this one, using the power and resources of the federal government to solve the critical supply chain issues preventing us from being able to test at levels adequate for safely re-opening. Not telling the states, who have no such ability or resources to do it themselves. We can do 300,000 tests a day right now. We need a million to make this work. Had the federal government done it's job two months ago we'd be at 2-3 million tests a day easily right now."
Well said!If it only helped 10% in the spread of the virus its worth the inconvenience of the mask. We all have loved ones who are especially vulnerable to this. The idea that science (which is always evolving) should be second fiddle to politics on a matter like this shows we havent matured much since the days of Galileo.
"Here's another: Testing and regulating products before they hit the market.Do you know how much safer we'd all be if there was a reliable antibody test readily available right now? There were many ready to be tested over a month ago. The FDA, whose ONLY job is to do so should've gotten started. Instead the political hack who was put in charge said ""Nah, we trust you."" What resulted was the market being flooded with dozens of tests. Many of which, including the most prominent one, were useless. We had to pull them all back and do the actual testing, wasting months.Edited: 10:03 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"C-19 is a novel / ""new"" organism. That fact alone contributed a lot to the mistake list compiled within the last 3 months. The POTUS..WHO...CDC...Fauci..Birx..the SBA..the US Treasury...the media...me...you...all political persuasions...all sides ..the Governors...all IQ's...part of the mistakes were simply because nobody had experienced this particular pathogen previously or one that exhibited this much impact when mistakes were made.. Unfortunately, the response to this bug was completely unplanned for and unanticipated by the grand majority of the population..we'd never seen it or experienced it first hand. We were all Covid ignorant.Then add on the inherent tendency of humans to screw up...just consider any part of history. Then include the emotional and economic concern anxiety that a 2-month shutdown has on a population..no wonder we argue about crap in here...we probably need to argue about crap in here..to vent. Why the hell not?PnS..I'll wager heavily ( up to $2.00) that I'm every bit as conservative as you are on most fiscal and other common / traditional policy issues. I will not go to Vegas and wear a mask..I just won't do it..I'll wait until the restrictions are relaxed. Yet, if I were forced to go for some reason ( like..a gun to my head), I'd wear the damned mask because it's not all about me; there are those pesky guidelines in place that take into consideration the health concerns of those around me, be they staff or other guests. Part of the mask-wearing guideline is about the human psyche..people's perceptions of what is safe. The resort management is probably counting on that aspect a bit. It's not my place to take that away from other people. Eventually, this mask vs no mask argument distills down to the proven effectiveness of mask use in reducing exposure to Covid droplets and potential transmission. I've looked at it a bit, and I'm far from a trained epidemiologist..but, sum total, it appears there is protection provided for both wearers and for those that come into contact with them. One can argue about the tradeoffs..the necessity of proper fit, need to resanitize, no touching with hands..all that and more. In the end, SOME protection is afforded ( like anything else, there is no perfect system..and no perfect human).If you don't want to wear a mask, don't wear one. Just consider and reconsider the concerns of others a tad when making those decisions in a public setting.Have a drink..listen to some good music..wade through this...Edited: 10:14 pm, May 12, 2020 "

"of course I'd wear one. If for no other reason than to add to the comfort of others.Unlike some though, I do believe it helps. Certainly not with 100% effectiveness but it has to be at least a little bit better than nothing.Having said this, I can't see myself going to Vegas as long as masks are even recommended."
"OCbusdriver9 I agree with you completely. I understand the current environment and I agree that masks should be required. If employees need to be required to wear them, then so does the public. The casino should make that a hard and fast rule and enforce it very strictly or if they don't think they are effective, then remove from employees.Many of the meat processing plants throughout the country did not think they were necessary and had to shut down with a huge percentage of their workforce sick and many died.So, enforce it or don't open as of now.And, I won't be going as long as they are even just ""recommended."""

Usually by mid-April we're at the point where our weather is fantastic through October. Been a weird spring. But I wouldn't trade our summers for anywhere.
"""Went there often as a kid. Stayed at the A frame cottage. Rode the horse. Or was it a donkey?""It was a horse. Did you play miniature golf there too? They had their own course there plus a waterslide. We actually owned one of the cabins/Afromes on the pond. Built it ourselves. 2 bedrooms loft up top. full bathroom etc... Those were the days."
First Wegmans I ever went in to was by you. Awesome supermarket. Now have on in Brooklyn. Still awesome and the best supermarket I've ever been too.
"I can remember the waterslide, that's what I think is the full waterpark now. I remember the hay rides and the pond, but not the mini-golf. But like I said, it's been a long time, early 80's, so my memory is hazy. I usually get up there once or twice a year, Oquaga that is. Gonna have to swing over and see what GH is still like."
"I agree with Chuck ""I will not go to Vegas and wear a mask..I just won't do it..I'll wait until the restrictions are relaxed. Yet, if I were forced to go for some reason ( like..a gun to my head), I'd wear the damned mask ""AND, the mask would be a fanny pack for dual use"
"For those who refuse to wear a mask, will you also refuse a vaccine if available?"
"Can do and will do. I have no issue with masks. Wearing mask in stores and all indoor places is the law in California, no mask no service. Pandemic is not easy on anybody, more challenging for some frontline people. All we have to do is to wear masks OCCASIONALLY. Arguing and fighting over this little thing seem trivia and petty. There is nothing most of us can do to help in this crisis, except to wear a mask. You can’t even do that?"
^^^ Mac Very well said.
^^^agree!
"Here here Mac.Debate all we like in places like this forum, but making life easier for those out there dealing with this isn't too big an ask. I see stories about that guy getting his arm broken at a Target for just doing his job and it depresses me. Like he is the one setting the policy? So even if making their lives a little easier is the only reason you do it, it's still a good thing."

"Actually I'm not going to take the vaccine. Whatever crap is put into that rushed out vaccine will probably be more dangerous to my health than 19. I don't get the flu shot either, don't get the flu but very rarely. Also, only in certain parts of CA are masks a requirement. Counties and cities set their own policies, the state hasn't mandated them. If anything masks are disappearing. Riverside and San Bernadeno counties recently rescinded their mandatory mask policies."
It is called a pandemic for a reason. Out of respect for dealers and other staff in the casino I will wear a mask. And I will return as soon as the first wave of visitors have conquered the top.
"Oh dear lord....Haven't even considered how the anti-vax crowd will factor into this when we get a vaccine. Thankfully unlike say measles, it shouldn't matter. Still thanks for depressing me none the less."
""" I'm not going to take the vaccine.""Super! Since it is going to be rationed, those who won't take it means another person can get it."
"The problem with that though is that there are many people who have legitimate reasons they can't get a vaccine, their compromised immune system won't allow it. There are millions. My friend who'll be dealing with chronic leukemia the rest of his life is a good example. They will need to depend on the herd immunity only a vaccine will provide to resume their lives. Thankfully for Covid the percentage likely will be around 70% or so vaccinated. So the anti-vax nut jobs shouldn't endanger them with their selfishness."
BD...actually cooking out spiedies for dinner tonight.Deposit is 30 miles east of bingo.Deposit still has a lot of city folk who have moved there in years past.Amazing how well they have adjusted to a very rural environment. BTW@ my son lives in Greenwood Hgts right next to the cemetery.
I will get the vaccine even though I get a flu shot and had the new shingles shot.And of course got the flu two years ago and shingles three months ago.
Back on topic... I will definitely wear a mask if it will allow me to play craps.Curious if wearing a mask in a casino will replace the need for social distancing ?OT...Racquette Lake ? great area but haven't been there since my younger days.
"2salty, that debate rages on and on!What is Upstate New York?To me it's anything north of Westchester.To Queens residents: Anything north of the city.To Westchester residents: Don't you DARE call us upstate!To Mahattanites: Anything north of 120st St.To Long Islanders: Wait, there's an Upstate part of NY?"
Boy I would be PO'd if I got the shingles shot and still got shingles. Those things are not cheap down here and you have to get 2 of them !
"I'm not anti vax. I have all my shots from when there were required as a child. Got a hep booster before I graduated high school as I did some volunteer work that required it. If I was ever in a position that was around viruses or required it, I'd get it again. I don't care to get the flu shot because 1.) I'm healthy and not in an age range where the flu has a reasonable chance of hurting me and 2.) I try to not put unneeded medicines/anything in me especially as the flu shot isn't a guarantee you won't get it. When I was very sick a few months ago, the only thing I took was some Tylenol, Motrin, and the occasional decongestant. Worked just fine. What would the point of been to have gone to the doctor? If something is well tested, is proven to work, and seems to be necessary, I'd take it. Otherwise, I'd prefer not to. And yes, better someone else who is terrified of the virus or is in a group that is more likely to be harmed by it than I take it. Makes no sense if I have a 0.02% chance of dying from 19 rushing out to take it, while someone with a 12% chance has to wait."
"Sometimes it amazes me how things can become complicated. I went to Home Depot this morning. There was a short line, and on the front door was a note: No Mask, No Entry! Amazingly enough, every single person who wanted to shop at Home Depot wore a mask. I don't know what the people who didn't want to shop there did, and Home Depot probably doesn't care.Not complicated at all: No Mask, No FlyNo Mask, No GambleNo Mask, No Entry.The only time there is ever a problem is when the rules aren't clear. So make them clear."
"I took whatever vaccine shots my doctor suggested, all free under my health insurance plan. Last flu shot, nurse asked me if I want the double shot? I asked How Much? She said Free. Give me Double! Never say No to free double portion! Shingles shot, plus all sorts I never heard of, give it to me. I had Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, BCG when I was a kid, that is related to lungs, some doctors say that built resistance to C19. I had Pneumonia vaccine few years ago, maybe that helps too? I had travel vaccines but can’t remember what or when. I’ll get a morning spray of Lysol too if that helps. I am going to email my doctor to see if they give Clorox shots. You can’t have too many vaccines. French study says smokers are less likely to catch it, let’s have a smoke. I heard of population refuse to take any vaccines, no opinion. Maybe they are right. Who knows? Theories change all the time.Edited: 2:42 pm, May 13, 2020 "
Of course. No question. Screw vanity.
"""French study says smokers are less likely to catch it, let’s have a smoke.""Careful with that, that's not even remotely researched enough. And even if true, smokers are at greater risk of complications if they do get it.As for the anti-vax stuff, no need to go there except to say that unlike the flu shot, it will be important for public health for as many people to get it as soon as it's available. Anyone anxious for Vegas to fully return has incentive to do so too."
"If it is required I will. Although I am uncomfortable in one, I will do what is asked to go into a casino."
“ I'm not anti vax. I have all my shots from when there were required as a child. ”Sounds like your parents were not anti vax. Silly rabbit kids do not make those calls.
"On daily news, such as last night, San Francisco had 11 new cases yesterday. I always wonder who, where, how, when and why? Who are these 11 people, where did they get it? What do they do? Did they wear mask? Wash hands? Are these homeless drug addicts? Senior homes? Etc. it’d be much more helpful if the authorities tell us more, privacy issues? they just don’t know or they don’t check/track. So that we can learn from these cases. 2 months into this crisis, I wore mask total less than one hour, in bank, in Popeyes to pick up chicken, grocery store. One hour out of 1440 hours, 0.0007%. Not a big deal, minor inconvenience, not even a sacrifice. I take it off as soon as I can, when not in presence of others, and when in open air, driving, at home or garden."
"I keep my mask in my pocket, pop it on when needed. The difficulty arises as we add social situations. Social distancing works better anyways, but that won't always be possible.Mass testing at an rapid rate and plentiful antibody tests would lessen the need for them. A real time tracking system with contact tracing too. If we had them mandatory masks everywhere wouldn't be needed. Regardless of where you stand I think we all wish we had them."
"No, I will not"
Yes. I will
"Of course, I would wear one. However, I don't plan on going to Vegas this year.Edited: 6:12 pm, May 13, 2020 "
I think I will sit the fence on this one.
What's the over/under date for the first mask-burning video?
"Well, when the wb in WH refuses, how can one expect his flock to wear one...leaders lead by example...currently , there is no leader...just like stay at home order, and ivanka and Jared left DC to go to N.J. for Passover...do as I say, not as I do, the motto of White House"
"Droplets of Covid 19 travel up to 26 feet on a sneeze. 6 feet when chatting or breathing heavy on your 30th throw on a heater. Wearing a mask will become fashionable, it will take a little more time for the resisters to get on board. I lived through bell bottom pants, we can all get through this too."
"@Hardten, Any bell bottom pictures of you?"
"Nope.....we won't go anywhere that requires them....in fact they are ""required"" here in Illinois and we won't, about half the people don't."
uber requiring face masks for passengers starting next week. makes sense.
">>Droplets of Covid 19 travel up to 26 feet on a sneeze. 6 feet when chatting or breathing heavy on your 30th throw on a heater. Wearing a mask will become fashionable, it will take a little more time for the resisters to get on board. << how long will it take for morons to figure out that adults know how to keep their droplets from going 26 feet when they sneeze? who cares what you lived through if you're still incapable of rational thought?"
"The interesting thing about this ""issue"", and tragic too, is that unlike the usual dog whistles they are fed by their handlers, this one will result in a lot of suffering. We'll see how ""brave"" they are when their hometowns get hit hard in the coming weeks and months."
there you go with the whole wishing people who don't agree with your idiocy get covid-19....and now spread it to their hometowns. wow.
"Wishing it? Dear god no. This is devastating and terrifying to all of us. While I disagree with how people are responding to their fear I most certainly don't wish them harm. As I clearly said it is tragic. I wish each and everyone one of us could resume our lives. Even those who are doing their best to make it worse.Good to see you again espnawards, last I heard from you, I think you were saying this was nothing and you'd be in Vegas mid-April. How was the trip?"
"taxis/ubers, planes, walking on busy streets where 6 feet isn't possible to achieve consistently. wearing masks makes sense there. i'll be wearing a mask in restaurants as well, but i'll take it off unless i'm interacting with wait staff who are within 6 feet of me. i'm hoping bars will have up plexiglass thingamajigs similar to what we see at drug stores so i don't have to do the same with bartenders, but i will if needs be. having them on all the time where social distancing is facilitated by the establishment you're in? where they have substantial amounts of disinfecting protocols and materials available to patrons and staff? that's just insane."
"And once our community develops herd immunity we will be mask free, coronavirus free and living the life of Riley.And on the other hand if this virus stays bad and requires mass vaccinations...well then my Covid19 stocks will increase even much more than the 200% gains I've made already and once again living the life of........you know the rest (sorry had to pull a Biden there)...lol"
John Adkins I thought you said you were already mask free and ready to pass it around to everyone because you would not wear a mask ?Wasn't that you ? Sure seems like that was you....
"Seventy percent of the US will need to get it at minimum for herd immunity to work. 230 million people. Even at a low end guess of 1% mortality that's 2.3 million dead. Not to mention this thing can really get even non high risk people sick it they're symptomatic, even if you're not hospitalized it takes several weeks to recover. The economic impact would be massive. The timeline to achieve ""natural"" herd immunity without overrunning our medical system and costing millions more unnecessary deaths is at least 5-10 years.Herd immunity stopping this without a vaccine is a myth.Edited: 7:53 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"espnawards. ""incapable or rational thought""? My wife says that all the time. Was that you? Never mind."

"Now, had to go to Home Depot yesterday, and my mask was in my wife’s car.Here, they require a mask, so I tied a Kotex across my face, and no one said a word.Hunt"
"Cool conversation here, and pretty adult (ok, maybe not the posts taken down that I didn’t see) applause to all for not wallowing in the mud. For me, if I go to Vegas I will wear a mask, I buy into the reduction in projectile droplets thru the inadvertent sneeze or uncontrolled cough that could dispel over many feet. I sneeze and cough into my elbow but...I occasionally do not catch a sneeze in time...especially when walking into “smell” situation. (Some smells elicit an almost immediate sneeze from me...some florals and herbals including marijuana).For me it comes down to the shopping cart theory...do you return the shopping cart to the store or corral when you are done with it? It takes just a few seconds to secure the cart in a corral yet there is no legal mandate to do so and no personal consequence if left loose. Loose carts block spaces and can cause damage to other cars. So are you a good member of society (you think of others) or a bad member of society (when you only think of your convenience without regard to others)."
"Ah, the shopping cart!Back when I lived in Denver, I had just had my Land Cruiser repainted.Parked far out at the King Sooners, and just as I got out, a woman ran into a line cart, sending it careening into the right front quarter panel, of my freshly painted truck!!When I yelled at her, she flipped me off.Should have lit a flare under her gasoline tank... but did not.Back to the body shop.Hunt"
"Hunt, remember, revenge is a dish best served cold. 13"
Yes. Of course. I don’t want to infect anyone.
"I wear one all the time now, even though I feel it is pointless unless everyone wears one. Maybe it gives me a false sense of security in hoping that its blocking incoming germs and not just suppressing my germ spreading"

"of course I'd wear one. Its a pain but seems to me to be the considerate thing to do. I believe wearing masks helps - maybe only a little -but still helps. Also, for me just as important, I think at least some of the other people will be more comfortable if we're all wearing masks.Having said all that, I'm pretty sure I won't be going if masks are even 'strongly recommended'."
Masks are there more for other peoples protection than your own. So its a pretty selfish thing to avoid wearing them in any type of potentially crowded environment. Your odds of contracting the virus actually drop by almost 80 percent if both you AND people you come into contact with wear masks.

"""Some folk are now saying that Covid can be transmitted, just by passing gas???""Only if you are butt naked."
Duluth trading company knows all about butt naked.
"""Some folk are now saying that Covid can be transmitted, just by passing gas???""It gives a whole new meaning to that phrase often used to describe a particularly pungent but noiseless fart, 'silent but deadly'."
"It's ""buck naked."""
">>So its a pretty selfish thing to avoid wearing them in any type of potentially crowded environment. <<yes, having a mask on where it's crowded is a necessity, agreed. which is why there are protocols for social distancing and reduced capacity limits in place. as long as people do what they're supposed to do in casinos, leaving off a mask the vast majority of the time isn't selfish, it's sane.people who are at risk for serious symptoms or who are going to be around those people still aren't supposed to be traveling anyway. those that do are the selfish and stupid ones. again, time to transcend the insanity and use reason."
"I was not aware of Buck Naked, Learned something new.While both buck naked and butt naked are used to describe someone who is fully nude, buck naked is the older of the pair. Butt naked is much newer and likely sees use because of butt having a long history of referring to a person's buttocks."
"Don't worry. You are probably still protected from old people, as many of them wear Depends anyway."
Of course. No reason not to. Won't make my trip any less enjoyable. Just need a good solution for cocktails.
Depends on the weather. If 100 degrees a mask will be be worse for you.
I'm sure this will not go over too well but does Hunt EVER post a serious reply? If you see most of his posts on this forum it's kinda sad.

Yes. Protect yourself from others.
"I suspect that, like myself, Bill often posts under the affluence of incohol."
World-class athletes have worn masks while training. Doctors have recommended masks that have some space between the face and mask and recirculates CO2 to improve lung function.
I don't think surgeons wearing masks for hours during surgeries worry about CO2 toxicity.
"If you look carefully at the masks on TV news, you’ll notice masks are mostly cloth type in varies colors and designs. Cloth mask is far more comfortable than those paper type. It is not one type in one color, human are much smarter, we evolved, adapted, improvised. We always have in history. You can turn this mask thing around, if you got to do it, do it comfortably with style."

The exhaled air goes out through a one-way valve, so inhaled air then comes through the body of the mask.I don't know how this would be seen in protecting against COVID-19, but it's the type of mask that I would prefer to wear."

"When circumstances require them, yes, absolutely. In close quarters, especially for extended time, like a gambling session, I'll look like a surgeon. I've had training on PPE from a previous life and I know how to property wear masks, gloves and other things like protective glasses. ...and more importantly, how to remove gloves.If I'm walking around outside, with few people around, there is no reason to wear masks, apart from virtue signaling. The number of people I've seen wearing masks, but no helmets while riding motorcycles amuses me."
"I will wear a mask even without the strong recommendation, as long as the pandemic is still going on. A mask is for my protection as well as others, so no urging from government or venues needed.I do agree with others that wearing a mask may make things less fun, which calls into the question of why bother. Is a trip to Vegas that important? Do I miss anything from Vegas that makes me itching to go back during a pandemic? For now, it is not for me. May be after it is over, or a vaccine is available."
"I will wear a mask if I see that most others are wearing one. I hate them... too hat, can't breathe, etc. I don't want to offend people who think I'm spreading the disease even if I don't think that's the case. If I see that lots of people are not wearing one, I usually don't wear mine."
"Not only will I wear one, but I won't walk into any business that doesn't require everyone wear one. If a person doesn't bother to do something as simple as wear a mask, I have to wonder what other common sense protections and habits that person may ignore."

In the years leading up to this virus I would guess that under 50% of men washed their hands in the public restrooms, some after a stall visit.

“ Locally they set up an encampment under tents for homeless at the Cashman Field parking lot. They supposedly were tested prior to entering. There was never a good follow up story so I am unclear how it ended out.”It was intended as a temporary place while they sanitized the nearby homeless shelter where there were a number of Covid cases. The shelter reopened on April 2nd. The Cashman site was then used to build a field hospital for homeless people with the virus. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/15/photos-las-v…
"@Irish, Good info, I had not seen."
I’m not one to typically bash the media. But I think the story of “ wow! There are homeless people sleeping in a parking lot!!!” was a bigger story than “ the homeless people aren’t in the parking lot anymore “. :)

"Varies reports said eyes are key entry points for airborne Coronavirus. One infectious disease expert visited hospitals well protected head to toe but still was infected, he didn’t wear eye protection, he figured that was the source. I am back at work today, first day of reopening. I wear mask and nonprescription eye glasses, keep safe distance from colleagues. I have 20/20 vision, I use glasses with no prescription. I don’t wear them when inside my office. It is all very easy. More so as a courtesy to make others feel comfortable around me."

"For those who still doubt effectiveness of masks wearing in public when social distancing is minimum, here's the latest study out of Hong Kong:https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-e…"
@jenaIt does say surgical masks which we know provide protection as that’s what’s indicated for healthcare workers for droplet protection. Home made masks would def be less.
A hamster experiment! Did any of those hamsters have a comorbitity?
"@LASAgree. Less protection with cloth masks still better than no protection.Glad to see more and more doing that in public. The combined efforts of social distancing, personal hygiene and masks of some type are powerful in curbing the spread. In the meantime life can somewhat go back to ""normal"". That's what happening in many places now."
"I , too, refuse to wear a mask. Public Health bureaucrats seem to see themselves as the ""experts"" when, in fact, they have been wrong as many times as they have been right on this virus. Quarantining a population after the virus has already arrived is an effort in futility. Better to look after the vulnerable and elderly and ensure they are not infected, than to close schools, universities, workplaces, etc. where the young and middle aged are working and at little risk of dying from the virus. This way you have the host losing strength and eventually losing the ability to infect the population. This will result in ""herd immunity"" This is true of any virus."

"Where I'm from is not really your business. If I WAS a New Yorker...what would it be to you? And if you don;t live here you have ZERO idea of what people here are like, or what they think. You're wearing a mask, so you're *protected*...what are you worried about? Your mask means you're immune to everything. So don't worry about other people and what they do."
"""You're wearing a mask, so you're *protected*...what are you worried about? Your mask means you're immune to everything. So don't worry about other people and what they do.""Where did you get that information?"
"Based on the behavior and attitude of people on this thread freaking out because I said..I won't wear a mask and cancelled my trip. If masks are sooo protective then no one here has anything to worry about. LOL Simple logic...unless...masks don't really offer that much protection and are just a panacea. But I'm sure that's not the case, right?"
Did you mean to say 'placebo' rather than 'panacea'?
"First a mask does not make you immune to everything. Don't be a silly goose. A silly Canadian Goose. If you were a New Yorker, your irritability and crankiness would be nothing out of the ordinary, we have our share.As for having zero idea, I've actually got many friends from the Toronto area who come down and golf here in NY a few times a year. Good people, missed seeing them this year actually. You ought to emulate them, as you're ruing Canada's reputation with your crankiness."
no I meant panacea
Your simple logic is incorrect.
"More accurately, *security blanket*"
That is your opinion. Either masks work...or they do not. So which one is it? You can't have it both ways.
Say hi to Steve M for me will you? I assume you're related.
"leeiab44 : Are you able to understand what you read? I don't want to bother to post a link for you to read if you have a low level of comprehension.Edited: 6:34 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"Are you? We don't need to wear masksne here and even if they mandated it I would not comply. That is my decision. I am not going to change your mind, you are not going to change mine. It is what it is. And no one's opinion, certainly not random strangers on the Internet really matter to me."
I don't really care about your opinion and honestly...I know the science so you can save your energy.
"""I know the science."" It does not appear so."
"Again, don't care about your opinion. At all."
You are misinformed.
"What didn't you get when I said I don't care about your opinion? But, keep talking. lol"
What makes you think it is an opinion?
"You don't have to wear a mask my friend. Just means you can't go to Vegas. I too have no interest in wearing a mask in Vegas. So I'm not going. Just not having a temper tantrum over it like you are.Do yourself a favor, smoke some of that good Canadian legal weed and relax, Vegas isn't going anywhere."
"leeiab44: Hopefully you can find the section that says ""Can a face mask prevent coronavirus from spreading?"" I believe that Johns Hopkins knows more about covid-19 than you do.https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/condi…"
"I’m not sure if leeiab44 is really Canadian. If so, he/she should mind their manners. P.S no one here cares if you go to Vegas or not. Cheers!"

You will wind up with the virus....sadly....
"Listen, nobody WANTS to wear a mask, but people with even half a brain, realize it need to be worn.. it is so sad simpletons don’t wear one, and that includes their reckless leader, the Bloviator"
"I've got three one wk. trips that've already been setup; late Sept. into earlier Oct., from late Oct. into early Nov., & then for NYE from Dec. to earlier Jan.The third NYE trip being the most expensive, due to the $90 airfare cost which had to be paid out of pocket. Thus most doggone ""def. yes"" I'll be wearing that mask! The only thing I could foresee that would prevent me of wearing the mask would be if Vegas were to shutdown again."
"Yes I will/do. Why? Because the virus is highly contagious. I don't want it and if I unknowingly have it, I want to decrease the chances of spreading it to someone else who may get really sick or die. Because this virus is so variable in how it affects people, I just want to wear one no matter the inconvenience. I won't argue about this with anyone. It is what it is."
"So damn simple, wear a mask...so sad that the windbag in WH, finally says to wear one, yet minutes later he isn’t...Poor Herman Cain, said on his blog to wear one, but in appearances with the windbag , he didn’t..now he is dead...connect the dots"
"Do motorcyclist want to wear a helmet,do we want to wear a seat belt, do we want to pay for mandatory car insurance,do we want to pay school taxes if we don't have school age kids etc...get my point,I hope."
"Happy to see this enforcement at the Four Queens.https:/…Why is he stubborn and aggressive? He's on private premises and required to leave.I've been dubious of security at the Four Queens while there, but this has much improved my regard for the Four Queens.Edited: 4:04 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"Yep, I have no problem wearing one and will continue to do so."
I'll wear one!! Dosen't bug me and i wanna get back to normal as quick possible.
"Anyone for southern fried face mask? Mmm, yummy!BBC News - Face mask found in chicken nugget in Aldershothttps:/…uk-england-hampshire-53662400Edited: 7:43 am, August 05, 2020 "
"""Happy to see this enforcement at the Four Queens.""Yes, happy to see them arrest the black man for not wearing one, but there are 10 other people in that video wearing a mask around their chin but none in the entire video are covering their nose and mouth. Now that's some impressive enforcement by Four Queens security."
"“ Yes, happy to see them arrest the black man for not wearing one, but there are 10 other people in that video wearing a mask around their chin but none in the entire video are covering their nose and mouth. Now that's some impressive enforcement by Four Queens security.”Watch it again.The man is not Black. He’s Hispanic. The other “ 10 people “ in the video not wearing masks properly are with him. “ Film this, that’s my cousin”, as the one guy is heard saying."
"Maybe he's hispanic, not really my point. And so they arrest a guy for not wearing a mask, and 10 other people with him are not wearing masks either and are not even told to put them on."
"“ Maybe he's hispanic, not really my point.”The race was important enough for you to mention. I wonder why?“ And so they arrest a guy for not wearing a mask, and 10 other people with him are not wearing masks either and are not even told to put them on.”Told by whom?If you’re security officers ( or police? I couldn’t tell which), and you’re trying to subdue someone, are you going to take a break from that to tell others nearby to fix their masks?Who would do that?"
OK officer Irish.... whatever you say.
Placebets schooled again

"#279 Glepaw, I think MacDonald's are still considering their response, in particular how much to bill her for the mask : )"
