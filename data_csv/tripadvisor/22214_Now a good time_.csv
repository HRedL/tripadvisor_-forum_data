Hi there. I have a desire to visit San Francisco this week but I was wondering how much is shut down because of the pandemic and what the atmosphere of the city is like.
What the atmosphere is like currently. I’ve been to SF a lot and spent much of time outdoors and meandering.
Most places are still shut down or operating at very reduced capacity. It's not really a great time to visit SF.

Another time then.
"Maybe next year, we hope."
"Late to this topic. As a local, for daily life and going about in the city, I don’t see much difference except no indoor dining. Less people, no crowd, less traffic, which are all good things. I do walking daily, 2 miles, no difference, better because almost no people. I don’t usually party or go to crowded places, so zero difference. I work daily in San Francisco, we all wear masks and we are not open to the public, no difference except the masks. As a tourist, I am a little different than most, I don’t go to crowded places, I like to walk the streets and neighborhoods early morning or late night, when there is nobody else out there, I look at doorways, alleys, cats, things in the corners, daily little things, soak in the environments. I walk for blocks and blocks in NYC, I see shops opening up, trucks making deliveries, ditto in Paris, Tokyo, Seoul or anywhere. I frequented Castro in the past, passed the bars and places, I didn’t need to go in to party to be a part of the scenery. If the pace is crowded, I don’t go in, I avoid crowd, so today is no different than before, except better.There is no difference today than anytime in the past. I don’t need other people to cheer me up; I don’t shop, closed stores make no difference to me. I don’t need a crowd to look, smell, touch or feel a city.Edited: 8:44 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"Many of the main attractions for tourists in our state are not open. I don't know if it's worth the risk of getting, or spreading, the virus to check it out at this time."
"From today's San Francisco Chronicle: ""California’s seven-day average of new coronavirus cases per day rose to 8,664 over the past week, the state Department of Public Health said Sunday. The average was dramatically higher than the previous week’s daily average of 6,987 cases."" I believe that the SF Chronicle is making its online coronavirus coverage available to nonsubscribers. They have two websites: www.sfchronicle.com and www.sfgate.com. It's a bit dense, but you can find the current San Francisco Health Officer's order at https:/…coronavirus-healthorders.asp .In my neighborhood, compliance with the outdoor mask requirement is below 50%. That's based on a small sample of observations; I got scared and rushed back home."
The OP has already postponed his travel.
"IMO, the only good time to travel anywhere is when the virus exposures are at a bare minimum or if an effective vaccine is available, taken & completed per the CDC. Fauci is who I listen to. https:/…vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf"
"""The OP has already postponed his travel.""Yeah, but at least Mac is out there doing those touristy things like looking in ""doorways and alleys."" Both are very good if you're playing Homeless Bingo. And don't forget looking for cats, such fun."
The OP (me) is not comfortable getting on a plane right now. The city by the bay will be better to visit another time.
"Good for you, Michael D! Smart decision. We all have to be patient."
"I was scheduled to exhibit in New York Gift Show in August, that was canceled and rescheduled to October, but again cancelled. Ditto for a convention in Dallas in October. All buyers from all major chain stores are not permitted to travel by their companies; all travel forbidden. My canceled business trips 2nd half this year include New York, Orlando, Dallas, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Seattle, Los Angeles and Tokyo. Nobody wants to fly. I drive by SFO airport twice a day, there is no activity at airport."
