"Ive noticed a few post regarding typhoid vaccine, We have been going to Goa for a many years now but have never been advised to have the typhoid vaccine,Has there been reported cases in Goa lately or have I been missing something."
HiYou're better off not knowing.There's little or no Vaccine in this country. You may be lucky and get some oral vaccine but even this is hard (maybe impossible) to get.BC
"It's one of the jabs that is usually recommended for Goa/India along with hep A, polio, tetanus and diphtheria.Edited: 7 years ago "
"Typhoid epidemics occur in 3rd world countries,!! so see your travel nurse re Other vaccc too."
"Sad to say but the UK doesn't have the jabs at the moment but you might get tabletsMore info and note, even if you have had the jab it is not a 100% protection vaccinereview.com/who-needs-a-typhoid-vaccin…Edited: 7 years ago "
"On the plus side the jab is readily available over here at most private hospitals cost is round 700 rupeesOn th negative side, you are not considered immune for 72 to 96 hours after injection..The injection is given in Mumbai to anyone on a NGO medical programme who has any need to work in the slums, even if they have had a booster injection certificate from their home country."
We're travelling to Candolim on the 20th and haven't been able to get the typhoid. The only one we were given is the hep A does anyone know if this seems right. Been abit concerned as getting close now
"Typhoid is one of the recommended vacs for Goa but if your GP hasn't got any in stock, there's not a lot they can do about it.You could try to get the oral tablets yourself or maybe try a private clinic to see if they have the vac,Have you had the vac before?If you've had it before and are just due for a booster, it's not so bad because you're not going to immediately be not covered exactly 3 years after your last jab - IYSWIM."
"We start our oral tablets tomorrow, Prescription from doctor but got to get them in before the anti malaria tablets."
hi KirstieH!Just wondered where you got your typhoid tablets from as I've been trying for weeks with no luck?!
We were given tablets by our GP practice without problem as they had no stock of the injection.
Am getting very worried cos already started malaria tabs n never had the jab before
"GeorgeI don't see there's a lot you can do, really.What exactly did your GP say re not having the vac?Did they offer any advice at all?If you're really worried maybe see if you can get the vaccine at a private clinic.Check out the link given in reply #4 on this thread."
Had my typhoid jab at GP surgery last week; no problem. If we can get it in the North East I would think all areas should be able to.
phoned my doctors surgery this morning for typhoid jab ...still not available!
"I got Typhoid jab yesterday. Apparently I got really lucky because my GP got a patch on Monday, first one for over a year!!! In the mean time they have been giving patients either: 1. Oral tabs. Consists of three tablets taken on alternate days, depending on GP/borough might require visit to nurse each time.2. Hepatitis A and Typhoid combination jab. Vaccination includes correct amount of Typhoid and apparently it’s not possible to overdose on Hep A.Both are suitable alternatives to the actual jab."
"We had our other jabs and are taking anti-malerials but the nurse at our local practice said the typhoid jabs were not available, and neither were the tablets unless we went private and bought them, she also sad the tablets could cause unpleasant side effects and if we choose not to have them it was still unlikely we would catch Typhoid if we took precautions which are usual in third world countries. Typhoid is caught by eating food or drinking water that has come into contact with either the feces or urine of an infected person (sorry, I know not a pleasant thought) so, eat at places where you trust the hygiene of the cooks i.e. they wash their hands, don't eat salads unless they're washed in bottled water, don't have ice in your drink unless you know it's made with bottled water. Having said that in the past I've had salads and ice in Goa and not really known what water was used, and neither of us has had so much as Delhi Belly, so go enjoy your holiday and don't worry too much."
"We had to take the oral ones, now started on the malaria today, got to take them for ages now as we're going for 8 weeks but will be worth it!"
I needed a booster jab last year - but my nurse was unable to get any. Even tried a couple if private health clinics in Lonfon to no avail - my GPs still are having problems getting hold if any & reading these posts looks like situation is getting worse! I'm going out for a month do may just get a Typhoid booster when I get there - I should be immune after a few days then.Boo
"My practice nurse told me that there wasn't any stocks of the typhoid vaccine available at the moment so they were giving the oral vaccine instead, I pick up my capsules tomorrow but my local pharmacy stuggled to get hold of these, it's taken over a week for them to get them for me, so anyone who's practice have stocks of the vaccine they are very lucky."

My nurse said jab wasn't available either had 2 hav the tabs
"Hi Georgie This is a old thread you are responding to, earlier this year vaccine for typhoid was in short supply but now it's seems it's readily available we had ours back in August if you are worried contact your doctorAnglicum"
"I telephoned my local practice today ,they told me that there was no typhoid vaccine available and they did not know if they would recieve any until next year! The tabs are useless if you take anti malerial tabs as well,dont waste your money,we were offered tabs for £30 each privately,i think some people are cashing in on the shortage."
"My Dr, does not have the vaccine , and it is one of the injections i do not really want to go without. We are going to have the jabs done tomorrow at a travel clinic , but it costing us £40.00 each.Such is life!!"
"We have the same here, Vurda."
With the vivitof typhoid tablets you can still take malarone providing you start the malarone at least three days or more after taking the third vivitof tablet. I dont know about with other malaria tablets tho. We has the vivitof tablets as no vaccine in our area even at the private clinics. We had no problems or side effects but they only cover you for one year and not three years. We got them from our surgery and there was no charge just nhs prescription.
"We were given the tablets 3months ago as booster was due, they last for one year so hope vaccine will be available next year if not it will have to be tablets again."
"Well , we are just back from getting our shots , they will cover us for three years .Having to pay is a bind, but not as bad as catching Typhoid!. Any one who is in the Ipswich area , the clinic have a good stock of vaccine, if you need it. I asked the nurse, and they are well covered for stock. If you want the number PM me."
Me and my wife got ours from our doctors this Monday with no problems they said they are not running short
"We had ours done in October, our Nurse said there was not a problem.:-)) Gel"
"It seems to hang on where you live , Some can get the vaccine ,some can not., All we can do is try the normal channels.If that does not work for us in our area, look for a private clinic.My Dr's is not getting any new stock until April they told me."
"Vurda Glad you have had your jabs no worries now, did your dr not offer you the tablet form?"
"Our GP doesn't know when they will next have typhoid vaccine. I wasn't offered the tablets, but had my jab at the Boots travel clinic at Liverpool Street station this morning at a cost of £30. Hopefully by the time I need another one in three years time it will be sorted out."
"LGG Thats really strange as we are not that far apart from where we both live, glad your sorted. :-)) Gel"
"Bit mad, really, isn't it. Apparently our health centre hasn't had any vaccine for months. Done now, anyway, and I decided to bite the bullet and have the rabies jabs as well - not because I think it's necessary for a two weeks holiday in Goa, because I don't, but because I have quite a lot to do with animals while I'm there, and I've just been putting it off for about four years."
Apparently 88% of the vaccine was recalled due to a manufacturing problem.
no typhoid vaccines available here on prescription we had ours from Boots £30 each they informed me that they had plentyfull supplies but not for prescriptions only for paying patients C
"lindamu, my Dr's does not have the tablets either. the travel clinic had both, the vaccine and the tablets .Of course I opted for the vaccine as it lasts three years , not the year with the pills. hopefully by the time i need it again the powers that be will have managed to get it right for all of us!."
"We had no problem in our area this year, we had the injection before we came.. Last year they were short and we had to have the tabs, which only last one year. Strange how diff. areas have a shortage.."
