"My family is spending a week near Grand Lake (on Sun Valley Lake) in mid-August. I'm curious about the effects of the pine beetle in this area. I've searched on the forum and seen posts about damage, but they are all from several years ago. Does anyone have more recent information? Thanks in advance!"
"Here is a good article about the pine beetle epidemic which as you will see covered far more territory than just Grand Lake and was not limited to the state of Colorado.…nationalgeographic.com/2015/…rosner-textWhat do you really want to know? Was the epidemic bad? Yes. Did it kill millions of trees? Yes. Are there a great many gray dead trees standing in the forests and on mountain sides? Yes. The trees are no longer rust colored because they are past that point. Are there still live trees? Yes. Around the town of Grand Lake itself, most of the dead trees have been cut down and it looks a little bit barren compared to what it did before the epidemic. Because pine beetles preferred lodgepole pines and the west side of RMNP had many more lodgepole pines than the east side, the west side of RMNP suffered more tree loss. The reason you don't see any recent information is that the damage is done. Due to a combination of factors - most preferred trees are dead, we are completely out of the drought that stressed the trees, temperature changes, etc - forest service officials say the pine beetle epidemic in Colorado is essentially over. This article is from one of our local news stations and includes photos.9news.com/story/…Obviously, the pine beetle epidemic has not impacted visitation to RMNP. Park visitation is up this year by 17.5% through June and will probably set a new record in 2015.Edited: 5 years ago "
"As the head ranger for the west side explained at a Rotary meeting in Grand Lake last week, the pine beetle has eaten itself out of house and home. They have moved on. Most of the dead trees have been cut down leaving lots of new trees and growth in its place. Grand Lake is beautiful in every season!Edited: 5 years ago "
"Thanks for the information, that was very helpful. We travelled to South Dakota's Black Hills a few years ago and saw the effects there, mostly the rust colored trees, but still an amazingly beautiful place. Looking forward to seeing the Rocky Mountains again, I haven't been since I was a teenager (a LONG time ago :).Thanks again!"
