Are there still some health issues and diseases present after the floods last year and is it true that there are some serious tensions between Temple and Church people that cause danger to tourists?
Hi No epidemics or major health issues prevail in Kerala after the floods. Regards
"Firstly, no diseases spreading right now in Kerala.Secondly, no threat for tourists. You can go, explore and zip around the places that you like."
"There is no post flood disease out breaksBut yes there are some political / religious issues on Sabraimala , which is a temple shrine. There is a hartal declared for tomorrow , 3 January 2019"
