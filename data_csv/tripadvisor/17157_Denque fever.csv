Does the anti malaria tablet Malazone guard against the mosquito which carries the Dengue Fever
"No, Jean! There is no pharmacological prevention against the Dengue Fever.Just avoid Dipirone, Aspirine if you have any fever in endemic areas at endemic season (summer), because these medicines can turn the illness (Dengue) into its worst hemorragic form. Because of that, when there is a suspicion, physicians use to advocate ""Paracetamol"" (Tylenol) instead of others. The use of insect repellent also helps a lot.Contrary to predictions, so far, dengue has no alarming numbers. But the peak incidence is in between January and March."
"No, Jean. There's no vaccine for dengue fever. I've heard that the vectors of malaria and dengue don't coexist. So areas that have many cases of malaria don't have cases of dengue and vice-versa. But I'm not sure about that."
what do u prefer... Malaria or dengue? man!
"Dengue is primarily an urban disease, while malaria usually affects areas of tropical forests (Amazon and other forests in similar latitudes in Africa). Malaria often is not curable, leaving sequelae. But, on the other hand it has an easier and more effective drug prevention through the scheme based on quinine. Dengue depends, for its effective prevention and control, of health measures and the participation of the entire population. Since it has no drug or vaccination to prevent it so far (they are undergoing preliminary studies in Australia and Brazil), we recommend the use of repellents, but these are not an absolute guarantee."
"By the way, BR...Answering your question: I ""prefer"" Dengue."
We never take any Malaraia tablets but always make sure we have a good mosquito repellent which we use at all times.
"Dengue Fever: Helpful hints:Use DEET. Most insect repellents contain the chemical DEET, which remains the gold standard of currently available mosquito repellents.Wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, particularly at dusk.Sleep only in screened areasAir-conditioning may reduce mosquito infiltration. Where air-conditioning is not available, fans may be helpful. Mosquitoes appear to be reluctant to fly in windy air.Do not wear perfume.Minimize skin exposure after dusk.“The mosquito's preferred breeding areas are in areas of stagnant water, such as flower vases, uncovered barrels, buckets, and discarded tires, but the most dangerous areas are wet shower floors and toilet tanks, as they allow the mosquitoes to breed in the residence.”http://bit.ly/13Xtud“It is a daytime biting mosquito with peaks of feeding in the two to three hours after day break, and the couple of hours before dark. However, indoors or on overcast days the mosquitoes may bite all day.”http://bit.ly/vy8nSC"
Just use repellents and you will avoid Dengue! i never had any problem.The World Cup is Our!And the Olympics too!Brazil Rio.
"BR—You obviously don’t live in Rio’s Laranjeiras neighborhood in Zona Sul. O Globo reported today that a large swimming pool there that has not been cleaned in over a year is full of stagnant water and debris, the ideal environment for Dengue-carrying mosquitoes. Despite the fact that neighbors have been constantly calling the Municipal Health and Civil Defense’s Dengue Hotline to complain about the fetid pool, nothing yet has been done. Obviously, not all residents of Laranjeiras are getting the message about the dangers of Dengue."
"Is it worthwile changing travel plans from end of December to mid September to avoid Dengue? How's the rest compare: weather (rainy?), hotel prices (20-30% less?) and ambiance (lots more ambiance end of december?)Thanks"
"In terms of prices and weather, worth it (on september, the weather is more pleasant and the prices too). But, if you are thinking (worried) only about the Dengue, I don´t think it is worthwile, because, though the risks, things are not so bad nowadays and you can take care by using repellents."
Of course it's not worth it to change your holidays due to dengue.
Brazilian health minister Alexandre Padilha warned on Thursday that the city of Rio do Janeiro is exposed to potentially one of the worst epidemics of the mosquito transmitted dengue disease in recent history.http://bit.ly/zWiMBd
"We are facing nowadays the lowest numbers of Dengue in the last ten years.Diferentlly from other years, when everybody by here had, at least a friend or somebody close that have had the disease, in this summer, there are few registration of cases of that disease. Perhaps because of the delay of the high temperatures.The Cordao do Bola Preta made a terrific parade by the streets of the center with more than 2,3 million people parting and having fun!Long life to Rio's Carnival and happiness... ""xô baixo astral!"""
The Department of Health and Civil Defense is today embarking on a mass operation to rid Rio neighborhoods of breeding hotspots of mosquitoes responsible for transmitting dengue fever. April and May are their key breeding seasons.http://bit.ly/Iv2nRYhttp://glo.bo/JnH5J3
"wonderful news. a travel expert said that ""you can't die from Dengue fever the first time....only the second....""time for 100% deet!!!"
I usually use 30% Deet. However I havé seen in Thailand variations for up 85% Deet. Didn't take iras it sounded too concentratedDoes anybody know iv it is good for thé skin? And can wefind those strong Deet in Brazil?Thanks
"Yes, You can find many different types of Deet in Brazil.About the safety of that kind of protection in such a high concentration... if does the strongest one is bad for the skin, I suggest you to go to a good Dermathologist (skin physician) to answer that and many other of your questions on a professional and reliable basis."
Rio do Janeiro officially declared it is suffering an epidemics emergency of the mosquito transmitted disease of dengue:http://bit.ly/JyY6Qs
"The main areas affected are in the suburbs of the city, north and west zone.In the center and south most touristic area (Ipanema, Copa, Leblon, Lagoa) it is not dangerous and the risk is not high.So, anyway, it is not a reason for panic. Just take some cautions as already stated above and have a good trip."
