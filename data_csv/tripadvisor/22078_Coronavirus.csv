"《《《《Is it true all bars, restaurants and clubs are being closed due to Coronavirus from midnight today》》》》No, I'm sure the information on this in the other 10 threads is all false."
Hi anita lDo you have a link to confirm this?TUI Coronavirus Information page says nothing.
Were due to fly with Tui on 21st from Birmingham. Wonder when they will confirm no flights.
It's a nightmare. We ...as well as probably many others were due to fly out Monday. Only communication from easyjet at moment is saying to change flight for no admin fee charge. Do we wait to see if they stop flying to get a full refund ? We have to decide by at least 2hrs before we are due to fly. Hotel was booked through an agent...at the time coronavirus wasn't an issue so I didn't take out protection...my mistake I now know. Have rung hotel direct and they said they dont know what is going to happen at moment but I need to contact agent. I held on the phone for over an hour and line went dead. My question is if hotel goes on lockdown then will agent refund money or will we have to claim through insurance? Any advice appreciated.
EasyJet can't make your decision
"My Das there just now and his hotel has just been locked down, so its definitely true and happening"
"IAre flights cancelled yet TO OR FROM Benidorm pleaseEdited: 6:18 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Hi ReHear LWhich hotel?Can you explain what you mean by ""locked down""?Some members are reporting that they are permitted to leave the hotel."
"We are allowed to go out, but with most places shut except for pharmacy or food shops what’s the point."
"Waiting for midnight, will post pics."
"Bigcol, will you stop questioning people who are in Spain and reporting on the situation. It is constantly changing. I know you want go go on your holiday and don't want to hear the negative but this is how it is right now.I have police ( not benidorm) driving around with loud speaker telling peopto stay indoors if they have come from Madrid to the coast."
"Hi sunloverSpain,I am simply trying to ascertain whether reports of a lockdown in Benidorm are true or whether they are exaggerations of the true situation.The people who can answer those questions are in the resort at the moment.The Generalitat announced a closure of bars etc but no restriction of movement i.e. stay indoors, do not leave your homes.Some are reporting a lockdown and some are saying that they are free to leave their hotels.I want to find out what the true picture is."
"Its seems fair for those considering whether still to travel what the realities are now and in the coming days what lockdown actually means in benidorm itself.Seems perfectly logical to get as much information as is possible.Atb steveEdited: 7:05 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Everything now closed. See what happens tomorrow.
"We was literally boarding the plane to Benidorm yesterday when the news broke that it was gone to lockdown, the full plane made the decision not to fly out, heartbreaking !"
"We was literally in the airport boarding our plane at 5.05pm when news broke it had gone into lockdown, the whole plane made the decision not to fly out, heartbreaking ! Have we made the right decision? What’s all the party goers doing now ?! I just cannot image such a busy place being like a ghost town x"
"Even if your flight is on. Dont go! Unfortunately you are unlikely to get any money back, but at least you are here and not out in Benidorm. My friends are stuck there. The hotel have told them that they are waiting to be told to going to lock down And everyone is going to have to leave, But there’s nowhere to go!. They went out last night but came home at 9:40pm. They said the atmosphere was awful, it totally changed. There were police with batons and helmets everywhere and fights were going off all over the place. They said they were sh*t scared. The insurance & The FCO were absolutely useless and told them they’re basically on their own. They said to wait it out in the airport with everyone else and hope someone doesn’t turn up for their flight!. They have a flight booked Sunday and Are desperately hoping it doesn’t get cancelled."
You definitely made the right decision. My friends flew there on Thursday and I’m now trying to do everything I can to get home. My friend said it’s been horrendous & she’s never going abroad again!
"My friends are in Benidorm now. The hotel spoke to everyone yesterday and told them that they would be going into lockdown in the next days, on government order. I’m not sure who others have been talking to but u can’t just carry on as normal in an all inclusive hotel as some have suggested. The lockdown means that the hotel is going to shut and everyone has to leave. There is no alternative accommodation as everywhere is under the same government order. everyone my friend spoke to is Going to the airport today to try and get flights home. All flights are fully booked & The FCO advised them to wait at the airport until you can get a flight (Fantastic let’s have a group gathering when is coronavirus about!) or travel overland to another airport and try to get home from there. There’s just no support for people stuck in Benidorm now"
Omg that’s so sad !!! I hope they get sorted
That’s so scary !!!
"Hi!This is a copy of a response to Post #25, which has also appeared on another thread:""The FCO have NOT advised against all but essential travel to Spain and certainly won't have advised anyone to go to Alicante airport and wait it out.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to the following regions that the Spanish Ministry of Health have designated as areas of community transmission of coronavirus: Madrid and La Rioja, and the municipalities of La Bastida and Vitoria (both in the Basque Country) and Miranda de Ebro (in Castilla y León).Flights to/from Alicante are operating normally (except to/from Italy).Benidorm is not in lockdown, bars/restaurants are closed as is the beach. No-one is confined anywhere.You are scaremongering. Stick to reporting facts.""I fully endorse this response!"
Just tumbleweed through the streets Nothing open
"Don't think anyone is scaremongering there are no bars ,cafes or shops open only supermarkets or pharmaciesthe beach is closed hotels have closed there pool areas and bars so what do you do all day walk aimlessly around the resort or sit in your room and watch TV the travel companies should be doing the right thing and offer people a full refund if they want to cancel"
"Hi!I have read reports that hotel bars are still open.There were several inaccuracies in the post by HxGirl, and they were highlighted in the post that I copied from another thread. The FCO advice that HxGirl stated were not only inaccurate but could induce others to head to the airport - that's scaremongering."
"My brother was due to fly out with Jet2 today, they insisted only Madrid shutdown, not true, Benidorm is in complete shutdown from 00:00 13th March for 15 daysAll amenities closed except for food shops and pharmacies. All restaurants & Bars shut, Inc hotel bars etc.Travellers not allowed to leave hotel unless for a medical emergency."
"Hi Russell,Not entirely true.People in Benidorm say they are free to leave their hotel, hotel bar open as usual."
surinenglish.com/local/202003/12/surge-local…
"We were due to fly tomorrow to Benidorm for a week. Just cancelled through live chat and received a full refund from Jet2 holidays.Edited: 5:59 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Hotel bars open, pubs and restaurants shut. Thank god for all inclusive. Schools closed and lots of shops shut, maybe childcare issues.Jet2 turning all flights back mid journey. Not looking good."
How do you know tui flights are cancelled for 2 weeks.
Presumably the indoor and outdoors markets won’t be open?Jules
"Is tui still sending people to Benidorm,in view of all being closed down for 15days"
"Yes it is true, all bars, restaurants, gyms and sports clubs closed at midnight last night for at least 2 weeks. Other forms of leisure activity also included. The town as taken on a very strange feeling/ Lots of panic buying."
"Search your Travel providers website.Everything will be done in order of preferenceTUISPAINFollowing local measures put in place by the Spanish Authorities, including closing some hotel facilities and the local bars, restaurants and beaches we have made the difficult decision to cancel holidays due to travel between 14 and 16 March. Although there is currently no advice from the UK Government against travelling to Spain it would not be the holiday experience we would want for our customers. We will proactively contact all customers due to travel to Alicante between 14 March and 16 March to offer alternative holiday options or offer a full-refund. Any customers due to travel between 17 March and 23 March will be contacted about their holiday on Monday 16 March."
"Good information that Jeny, we are due to fly on the 24th but are fully aware that there are thousands of people who need information before us so we will just sit tight and wait for info, very likely it will be cancelled and we will have to deal with it accordingly. Also due out on the 21st April and already presuming likely that it will be cancelled as well. Somethings are more important than holidays!"
Yes they’re closed. Going to close the beaches too
"#23 post: if hotel goes on ‘lockdown’ guests will be told to leave the hotel. Surely that information is not accurate, they cannot put people out on the street?"
"We were supposed to fly with Ryanair this morning booked through sunmaster to benidorm.we didn't go because of the lockdown, and apparently we are not getting our money back. I just can't understand how some airlines are still flying in, whilst other as use common sense and give people a choice."
My parents are stuck there the information is accurate all of spain is on lockdown
Now TUI are advising all holidays up to 29th March will now be cancelled. Although we have lost our holiday albeit it with a full refund my thoughts are with all the hotel / bar owners and residents. Kind regards to all.
no bars cafes resteraunts open hotels close Wednesday walk about or drive at your perildon't come
anybody seriously stuck we have an empty apartment if neededrdudden@aol.com
"How extremely kind of you,hope it helps somebody outB"
"Hi, what is the situation in the city now?"
"7 new cases of coronavirus in Benidorm yesterday, this is from a friend who stays there."
"Shezza , maybe you should cancel and wait until you deem it safe."
"I'm not actually booked for this year, someone asked what was new in Benidorm and I answered!"
"Shezza please read this to get the correct information. The 7 where over the last 14 days and only 1 reported infection in the provence in the last 11 days. https:/…coronavirus-covid19-updatesEdited: 8:24 am, July 15, 2020 "
"Shezza, I'm pretty sure when someone asked what was new in Benidorm they probably meant shops and bars and not any new diseases or viruses."
"Possibly, but the headline says Coronavirus"
Actually I have screen shot my friend sent and it was 7 NEW cases on the 14th which I believe was yesterday?
pretty obvious that post 51 was asking about the situation with the virus in Benidorm and Shezza replied
Shezza Have you read my link ??
"Ooops, maybe I should read backwards.I apologise for my haste and assumption.As they say assume makes an ass out of U and ME"
Taken from the link I gave 14th July - Latest local information 10 PCR+ in the last 14 days are those notified by the Sanitat Conselleria in the Baixa Navy.7 in #Benidorm1 in #Finestrat1 in #Callosa1 in #lalfàsdelpi15th JuneEleven days in a row without deaths from coronaviruses in the province and a single infection. Hospitals maintain 6 patients in ICUs and 37 admitted to the ward
"This Coronavirus doesn't seem to be going away,who thinks that they should of just closed all borders and not let anyone to leave there countries, as now one seems to know what they are doing in the world."
"now now jenny so the new member didnt say please or thank you ,,not a big deal that surely ?im pretty sure that travellers going to Benidorm are interested in the situation with the virus, if your not interested in the virus Jenny then i suggest you scroll on past it"
Anyone can post figures on every type of illness going and then post them on a forum. If that's what is wanted. Sure you will get lots who are very eager to post all sorts of daily figures. Whether they are interested or ever intend to holiday in the resort or not. Maybe have the figures for all other resorts throughout tripadvisor. Sounds a great idea.
"If people can read that there has been only 1 infection in the last 11 days it could well make people's minds a little easier, there is a lot of people who are worried about taken a holiday and deciding to cancel or not, the link I gave may help them."
"#51..Adrian is obviously a Facebook user. Ask simple questions, expect simple answers!! Regular forum members are much more polite.Steve"
"Hello Peter. I refer to post 52. It gives a different understanding of figures from you. My point is that anyone can come onto a forum and give numbers, they may not always be correct or could be taken out of context. This thing is not going away, it is here to stay for a good while yet. Now we have post 63.Re; Post 63... by louis.... This Coronavirus doesn't seem to be going away, who thinks that they should of just closed all borders and not let anyone to leave their countries, as now one seems to know what they are doing in the world."
"Hey malc, me and you against the world.That'll be a first :)"
"It is indeed not going away anytime soon, those planning to travel soon or later on will no doubt endeavour to do it as safely as possible for themselves and others and keep an eye on a rapidly changing situationThose not planning to travel (as you keep telling us) stop worrying, maybe?Atb steveEdited: 10:37 am, July 15, 2020 "
"Just because you are soon off to the Costa Del Sol Mally. Take care and stay safe, wear your masks (but not 2 masks together) Wash your hands and so it goes. Hope you have good weather. Remember your friends on the Benidorm forum. Tell us what it's like to travel whilst mr and mrs covid is around."
"Jenny the post I gave referred to an official release and I gave a link the other post was second hand information, if you look at both posts it is obvious to me where the error came from it was released on the 14th that there was 7 reported cases in Benidorm but over a period of 14 days not 1 day the release on the 15th stated 1 case in the last 11 days. I hope these figures help to to put people's minds a little easier if they are traveling soon."
"There's only 4 in Fuengirola.Not sure if that's yesterday, last month or tomorrow."
"To be fair Peter. If everyone was tested Everyday, Everywhere, there would be a much higher amount of positive cases. I did read your figures and understood them. Thanks for posting."
Yes jeny spot on. It's worrying as well how many people have the virus but don't have the symptoms.Infection rates in my area have soared yet this doesn't reflect in the number of hospital admissions at the moment thank goodness.Thanks for the update Peter.Dawn x
"Maybe alot of us have had it, without any symptoms who knows. As we know this is is not going to disappear, so we have to get on with our lives as safely as we can. There comes a time when we have to weigh up the risks."
