"Do not be fooled by this!! Please read onA test upon arrival or prior to traveling to Barbados means nothing! We are a British family who are so grateful to have just returned yesterday August 29th 2020We travelled with tests (which by the way were not even checked upon arrival) however British Airways sat us next to someone travelling without a test who then tested positive upon arrival in Barbados 2 hours later - what does this mean ?? Well you are given a phone call by a government health officer who tells you you must isolate in you room for the next 7days - no you cannot swim in the pool or visit the beach , you cannot pop to the shop for a drink or leave the room to order food . You are contained to wherever you are staying!! We travelled with our 3 teenagers- it was an absolute nightmare. On the 7th day they booked us in for tests at the local clinic-horrendous is all I can say , had to wait 3 hours and then another 26 hours for the results. Ok our tests were negative thank god , we had 2 days left of our £8000 holiday . However do more research on where you get put if you are unlucky enough to test positive- you do not then get to isolate in your room even if you are asymptotic- you will be collected and taken to Harrison’s point holding facility in at Lucy where you will remain until you test negative, this is no hotel or even hostel, you can google it . There is currently an English family being held there as the father and one child tested positive upon arrival at the airport. Please look into all this as for us this was an extremely distressing week full of anxiety, it is not a safe country to travel to yet and as tourists the locals were not all very friendly as we have previously experienced in the past 9 years of holidays here . We met fellow travellers in the same position, almost every flight into Barbados since they started up again on July 18th has at least 60 untested people and unfortunately 1-2 that then test positive upon arrival- this means if there is one positive on the plane there will be a minimum of 20 passengers in the surrounding seats put into isolation Plus the people they have traveled with !!"
"That's not nice Emma. May I ask where on the plane you were sitting? World Traveller, Plus, Club, etc.? Our concern, even though BA cancelled our flights for Friday, is getting on and off the plane because of the multiple touch points as well as seating density.Your mention of growing unfriendliness is also quite disturbing. Has anyone else noticed this?"
"It's a very uncertain time to travel at present. I understand you are upset that your holiday was impacted and it highlights the problem of some people not testing beforehand although this could potentially happen even if everyone had tested negative 3 days before. I think anyone travelling at the moment has to accept the risks that go with it. If you test positive you will be put into isolation until you test negative - it does not matter if you are asymptomatic. If you are unfortunate and come into close contact with anyone who tests positive, you will be required to quarantine until you test negative. I don't think it's fair to say that it is not a safe country to travel to - the infection was bought in on your flight... they didn't catch it here."
"The plane was full, We were in economy row 32 however you have no idea where ever you sit on the plane who is travelling next to you. We did everything as required and were put in this horrendous situation without any help. They come to check you are in your room and take your temperature readings twice daily . We struggled to get a grocery delivery as it is not like going online like we do in the U.K. and so had to rely on the few restaurants locally that would deliver us food , we hadn’t even had time to do a supermarket shop before we were isolated, there was no understanding with this either - we were told “ you knew the risk when you travelled”. We have always found Barbados to be extremely friendly with lots of interactions with locals and at bars however there is a different feel at the moment and they tend to see us as the ones that are bringing in the covid!They have track and trace where ever you go to eat or drink so also be aware if you are in a restaurant and someone else on the list that evening tests positive you will also do isolation time of 7 days!! They do not seem to understand covid-19 here and think that if you have no temperature and do not test positive within 7 days that you cannot get it ! What about people that test positive on days 7-14 ? I can see them having bigger problems here in the up coming months and am just glad we got home without any further problems."
"What do you mean we do not understand Covid here? You are complaining about having to quarantine and then say we don't understand it. Of course we understand it, that's why your holiday was ruined and you had to quarantine. We are in exactly the same position - if I go to a bar and I unknowingly come into contact with a positive case, I will get the same treatment. I don't know what you expected to happen."
Thanks for the post Emma. This has confirmed what I already was planning to do. I will cancel my Barbados trip and look for a more welcoming country to tourists. To take you away if you rest positive and almost hold you prisoner is not a holiday I am signing up to! Barbados needs to stop sitting on the fence. Either welcome tourists or not
"No I totally agree with you however the airlines should be clearer about the amount of people returning home to Barbados without tests . We were obviously naive to believe others were being tested and this does put people in a dangerous situation. It is bad for the economy in Barbados too if they could pick up on these cases before they fly it would put many less people from that flight in isolation and go onto enjoy the beautiful island instead it leaves people like ourselves to come onto these forums and let others know the reality of the risks .It’s not just Barbados I am saying is an unsafe place to travel to its any flight where it is not compulsory to be tested before . Covid -19 is no different in Barbados to the U.K. Why anywhere else in the world is the isolation time 14days ? and yet in Barbados only7 ?? You can even read about the Ghanaian nurses that flew over to help - they didn’t test positive until the 10th day in isolation , what happens with more cases Like these , eventually the island will have more and more cases . Protocols need to be in place for testing before entering. Ok there will still be cases coming in from people that catch it after testing but nowhere near the amount being affected now ."
"I'm really sorry this happened to you but this risk has been known for weeks now. It is exactly the reason why we cancelled our holiday for November. I am really surprised that you didn't understand that this could be a possibility before you travelled. In response to the Bajan people, we have been travelling to Barbados for 20 years and they are lovely friendly people, it is one of the things that keeps us coming back. Again I am not really surprised that some people are nervous and wary of tourists at the moment, they are the people bringing covid into the country after all. They are between a rock and a hard place they know they need the tourists to support the economy but human nature would make you nervous."
A negative coronovirus test is only negative up to that point. It does not give you any guarantees or immunity because in the hours and days before your flight you can unsuspecting come into contact with an infected person who is asymptomatic or not. Barbados has always been a friendly country but they obviously have to do right for their citizens.They do not want a mass pandemic in their country hence the reason your family were quarantined for seven days.I fear the time will come for tourists to return to Barbados but not this side of Christmas. Way too risky for my bank balance and health.
"Yes I Totally agree with you ...Just worried they are not doing what is right for their residents - isolation should be 14 days is what I am saying to completely say someone has not contracted COVID-19. Not ideal for travellers , hence being too early to open up Barbados to visitors on a short vacation but the right thing to do for the island . The fear is when they open up in October and flights are running everyday,I suppose we can only wait and see then"
"The problem is Emma they just can't survive not opening up either so from what I have read they are just trying to find some mid way ground to restart the economy that keeps the country as safe as possible whilst also not being too strict on tourists, it's such a difficult dilemma. Hopefully better testing in Countries of departure pre flight will eventually start to make the scenario much easier. Your experience just confirms to me that it certainly isn't for me at the moment sadly. I hope you get to go back as soon as it is safe and regain your happy Barbados memories."

"Emma when you jump head first into the sea are you surprised that you get wet?The risk for travelers was well documented and the procedure if the worst happens was transparently explained. I honestly don't get what youre complaining about you say having to quarantine was horrible then turn and say they should've held you for another 7 day...You also complained about not being allowed to grocery shop after sitting next to a positive case... The truth of the matter is you took a gamble, loss and are now mad about it which is understandable. What however isnt is your hysterical interpretation of the situation. Any amount of tourist in Barbados is better than having zero"
"""The reality of travelling.. in the current situation"" is that the UK Government advises against all but essential travel at the moment. Their travel advisory for Barbados clearly states that the Barbados Government can require quarantine if you are deemed to come into close contact with someone who is positive. Also ""they tend to see us as the ones bringing in the Covid"" , well yes, we were Covid free until we started opening up the flights again. I understand that all current cases have been traced back to either returning nationals, nurses or visitors. We may have different opinions on when we should relax the rules and try and help the economy, but to complain when you have gone against current Government advise is a bit strange.."
"A 1 minute search gives you access to the tourism protocols of any country in the world.A 2 minute search gives you access to dozens of people that have gone through it. Now imagine what you would find at 3,4 and 5 minutes of searching... Ignorance is in no way a defence for not knowing something thats been clearly explained. Your last paragraph is correct it will show what happens when one is unprepared when travelling to a foreign country and how risky it is. Hopefully others will learn from your mistakes and educate themselves before leaving.Edited: 6:34 am, yesterday "
Barbados is not on the non essential travel list in the U.K.
Thank you for the information Emma.Let’s hope this mess will eventually get under control.
"I am so sorry your holiday was impacted by Protocols set to try keep the people of Barbados safe but I am surprised that you say you were not warned about the situation.? Surely you read the Protocols set by the Ministry of Health and Wellness for visitors travelling here from different countries , especially at a time like this ?  You have come on TRip Advisor to complain about what happened to you, but you obviously didn't read Trip Advisor BEFORE you left. There are hundreds of posts on here, explaining exactly what can happen to you if you travel in these uncertain times. While you are here now, just read through the forum and you will see everything that has happened to you has already been discussed many times. One thing that really does surprise me is that you were allowed to stay in your Hotel and Quarantine instead of being taken to a Government assigned Hotel. PLease may we ask where you were staying ? Was it self catering somewhere . Another thing you missed by not reading this forum before you travelled , or even while you were here, is that we have companies who specialise in delivering Groceries and even cooked meals to your door . You only had to ask ! How you could be annoyed that you were not allowed to shop and then say Barbados is not a safe country, I'm really not sure, but I realise you are upset about your holiday being ruined. Your holiday was ruined,but not by Barbados. Your holiday was ruined by Covid 19 and the fact that you did not do your homework sufficiently before you flew regrettably  Barbados so appreciates visitors coming here during such awful times , so thank you for trying and I really hope you will return when life becomes a little more normal. Stay safe, I really don't envy you living in the UK at the moment. Edited to say SNAP Bimfan !!Edited: 8:45 am, August 30, 2020 "
Emma did you book all your travel on your own or use an agent/travel company? Unfortunately here in the US Sandals are advertising consistently on TV and the adds make travel look like nothing has changed. It gives the impression you can travel carefree be it an AI or other accommodation. Very misleading.I surmise precovid many travelers do not check advisories or dig too deep beyond the basics when traveling. Maybe more do now but as Emma said a fair amount dont have the info they need. It appears that Emma was surprised that testing pre flight was not mandatory. I am sorry Emma your trip ended up as it did and I am sorry you didn't know your situation was a very real possibility.I fly JetBlue regularly and recently received an email that stated since I will be flying soon?(I am not) to make sure to check my destinations covid protocols before travel and to do so often as they can change rapidly without notice. All airlines should be doing this.Yes we are responsible for ourselves but airlines and accommodations also need to take some responsibility too.
"I returned yesterday from a 13 night stay. BA flight was great, printed off all necessary paperwork in advance and this speeded up processing through the airport on arrival. Very impressed with the whole protocols put in place. Was out of the airport in under an hour. Things were quiet on the island but we had a great time. Barbados is in desperate need of tourists. We respected all necessary requirements of bars, restaurants, supermarkets etc. Did not meet a single local who wasn’t courteous. BA sent numerous emails in advance to keep up to date, plus various links on my booking. Not sure why they can be blamed. I’m sorry your experience wasn’t great"
"Thank you Emma for your warning and description of your experience. Despite reading about the various protocols, there is nothing quite like hearing about someone’s firsthand experience and it has highlighted the stark reality of what could happen to us if we go ahead with our holiday. Your post more than anything else has really made me reconsider. I don’t think you came on here to be told you should have done more research. I get the distinct impression you already realise that now with your warnings such as “please look into all of this” and “do more research”. Thank you."
Gary I’m really pleased to hear your trip went well. More stories like yours would be really encouraging but hearing Emma’s experience is quite sobering. There is nothing you can do to prevent that happening with the current protocols. It’s just bad luck if you end up sitting near someone who tests positive. For a 7-10 day trip I’m wondering if it’s worth the risk.
"#21 Well said Bluespacesky. Agree totally.Edited: 9:14 am, August 30, 2020 "
You hit the nail on the head Bluespacesky.
"Be interesting to know what ""near"" means...On the Ba flight its 3-4-3 in ecomomy so does it mean if youre sitting next to the covid carrier, or in the same row (even on the other side of the plane) or the next row?Any firm intel from anybody?.Does sitting in PE or club impact the thought process as the density changes?"
"We met 19 others at the randals Phillips clinic which only took people staying in that area , there were others around the island at different clinics , we were given an approximate idea of 30 people but never told if we were next to the person as information was not forth coming."
Thanks Emma.. it would seem that the best place to sit would be furthest from others so thats in the first or last row of you cabin in the window seats.Conversely the middle row of 4 seats(DEFG) anywhere ecomomy other than the front/back row has got to be the worst place to sit as your will be near more others. This is even worst for a family of 4 in the middle as the end two will be next the the C and J seats as well as people behind and in front of them.There is less people per square metre the further forward you sit so the chance of someone sitting near you decreases. The side pairs in PE would seem a good bet for couples especially the front/rear rows. There is only 7 across per row (10 in ecomomy) which is less than Club at 8 across. For those with deeper pockets 1A would be perfect in first statistically speaking :-)Anyone else have other thoughts on this?
"<< “BEWARE COVID-19 cases on British airways flights Barbados“ >>Wow... who could have predicted such a thing?!!?Oh, wait...Anybody.:-0Edited: 10:39 am, August 30, 2020 "
"I haven't been following this forum particularly closely for the last few weeks so was quite glad to have the whole thing spelled out in one go by someone's unfortunate experience. I must admit, I thought tests prior to flying were compulsory. Emma - I'm glad to hear you all escaped picking up this infection.We're due to fly out in November on a BA holiday to Barbados so stand to either lose around £600 if we cancel or maybe we can use the money elsewhere with BA or even for next year's Barbados trip. I haven't investigated yet. We are in the UK for a short time (quarantined) but when we return to France we will have antibody tests as I think we may have both had covid. However, after reading of Emma's experience, I think we'll postpone until next year as there still could be a problem even if we've had it.Edited: 11:05 am, August 30, 2020 "
"Sunshinebob over on Facebook someone was asked to quarantine and was told they had been sat within 2 rows of someone who had tested positive. I have never seen the rule officially documented anywhere. I think you'd have to ask the Barbados Information Service, maybe they could tell you. It's still a lottery depending on where you sit and a risk you have to take sadly if flying to Barbados."
Thanks Emma. Nothing like hearing someone's experience to help understand the potential implications if things go wrong. I'm sorry that happened but thanks for sharing.
#29 - completely agree Chris. It seems however that some are very quick to shoot others down these days. I’m glad she shared her experience and the process she went through. It’s all very well saying read the protocols but there’s nothing quite like hearing from someone who experienced what happens.
"Emma,---------------please could you tell us whether you were staying in a Hotel or self catering ? I ask, because the fact that you were made to quarantine in the accommodation you had booked goes against everything the Government is telling us !! I am amazed and saddened that you were left to your own devices, as I said earlier, there are several companies who deliver groceries, and cooked food from restaurants and had you been informed of that both you and the companies would have benefitted."
"For passengers on a flight that someone has tested positive on , the general rule is that people in the first two rows before and after the row that the infected person was sitting in are either tested or quarantined, this has been standard long before CV-19 for infectious diseases ."
"An apartment !! We were not asked to move either just to let you know. Others on our flight were in different places , 3 in south beach hotel , 2 in infinity on the beach . We did try to island order - unfortunately the registration took 48 hours ."
"Very sorry to hear of your experience Emma. Did you check the postings on here beforehand? Many of the points you make are covered but I have to say there appears to be some failure by government to make clear that if you board a plane with a negative test yourself and then happen to sit 'near' (no definition of 'near') someone who later tests positive, then you are liable to be isloated in some way.This lack of clarity goes to the heart of the problems with (understandably) ever changing protocols. I cannot find any reference to any of this possibility of such isolation in the last two sets of protocols but maybe I am missing something. You book on 10 July and they are all different on 13 August. Things seem to get missed out and so as a visitor you suddenly find that you are meeting the (competely) unexpected. Westie and mdp (among others who have long experience on here and are authorities), am I myself missing something when I say this?This issue arose a few weeks ago as well when some visitors sat 'near' were apparently taken to Harrisons Point even though they themselves were negative. The problem is that I am not sure how many people would travel if the following were stated clearly:""You should try to have an advance test to show you are negative (it makes the process speedier and safer), but you can instead have the test on arrival if you want. If you have your negative certificate and by chance travel near someone who is found to be positive, your holiday will effectively be over and you will have to either go into Harrisons Point or stay in your hotel room."" This is a very stark situation/choice and is a high risk in terms of possibly making an expensive holiday unsustainable, and such a bald clarification would effectively invite mass cancellation of those coming for a couple of weeks. Again, please correct me if I have this wrong.And Emma, do you think in fairness you did everything you could to find out what might happen, before you left, or booked? It's not a loaded question and I am interested because your case seems to pose us some awkward questions now."
"#35SW Nova Scotia - do you have a link to government rules or protocols where this 'general rule' of 2 rows before and after are affected in this way by cases? Either in Barbados or Canada (or anywhere!)?Edited: 12:56 pm, August 30, 2020 "
"Thank you for that Emma . The Protocols insist that ALL visitors in Quarantine must be taken to a Government assigned Hotel OR a villa if it has been passed as suitable by the Ministry of Health and Wellness , 72 hours before use, and I understand that the rules are so rigorous , very few pass if any so far. You have proved to us that all this is no longer true . ( or perhaps never was ) and I thank you for that. I must say I had no idea that Price Whirl etc required lengthy registration !!!! That too is a revelation and something they obviously need to look at. What a shame that it took your ruined holiday to bring all this information to the fore."
"btw I have just seen the following in the 3rd Aug protocols: ""Those persons who are deemed to have been in close contact with a positive case will be quarantined at approved facilities."" This does not make anything clear - in fact, I now remember that when it was commented on by one of my clients, they assumed that it meant that if you lived with someone or if one of your family or party had Covid. Not that it might refer to someone else on the plane.Again, this is the kind of thing that needs to be made absolutely and fundamentally clear - ""you will be isolated or quarantined if you are sat x, y or z seats from a person who tests positive"". For example at Grantley Adams, the authorities have been placing people on crowded buses on arrival forcing new sets of people into close contact - does this count? If that is the case then surely every single person on that rammed bus should be in quarantine as well as the people sat 'in close contact' on the plane? If not, why not?Edited: 1:06 pm, August 30, 2020 "
"Joe,I am no authority on the Protocols,but I do endeavor to keep up with them in readiness for the arrival of our first guests. Plus I have a lot of time on my hands for obvious reasons lol  Emma's account of what has happened to her, though it was well known to be a possibility by all readers on this forum and, of course , not everyone , reads this forum , is rather alarming as it proves that the ""Powers that Be "" can change their mind , and the rules regarding how these cases are treated , without updating their website, notifying anyone by way of the media or any other form of communication.  I'm afraid that really, we are all therefore in the dark about many things that should be public knowledge!!!"
"Yes we did a lot research prior to travel , we even cancelled our Spanish holiday after more research and quarantine being implemented upon arrival back in U.K. we understood we needed to travel with clear negative tests , and were under the impression this was compulsory when booking.we also knew we would be monitored for health screening twice daily between 7-9am and 4-5pm.Upon arrival at Grantley Adams we were all placed in buses , mixing again with more passengers, then funnelled into queues without social distancing , there seemed to be confusion who should be where . At this stage we realised people had not been tested as they were calling for them to go to a separate area! We love coming to Barbados and are saddened by this whole situation, even more saddened others on the forum do not understand that this is not about me complaining merely highlighting the reality of what is happening. Another lady from our flight was staying in some local apartments on the beach and was able to freely swim here daily .Yet one other lady had moved accommodation 2 days in to her stay and they couldn’t contact her , she was arrested at 10pm and taken to a holding facility mid week and told she had not followed protocol. She stayed there until her test came back negative on Tuesday lunchtime.Every one of our situations was handled differently with different restrictions."
"Hi everyone. On a related note, can anyone clarify whether a negative NHS home test kit result is acceptable at the airport? I am due to fly on 22nd Sptember but the NHS drive in clinics appear to have been significantly scaled back. My nearesst is now 50 miles away! Sny constructve advice or experience on this woudl be very welcome!Thanks all"
"No, home tests are not accepted"
"Joe, #38. There is no set rule for the 2 rows, it's more of a general guideline that is used. There are plenty of references to it on the web, here is one, scroll down a bit and you can see where the article makes a reference to the CDC about it.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52822913"
"Oh my god, that is unbelievable that someone was arrested after changing accommodation after 2 days! I still think even though I am still so sad not to be visiting this year your account just reinforces all the perils of travel at the moment Emma ."
Not the time for UK people to be traveling to the Caribbean. Most people from this side of the world can’t go there.
"I know that sounds Draconian UK , but consider this. By laying out Draconian Protocols, our Government was able to achieve a NIL Covid count on this Island for over 6 weeks.  Why would one visitor feel that she had the right to break the law when all she had to do was pick up a phone and report her new address. She apparently had two days to do it !! Of course her failure to stick with the rules was dealt with in a severe way. We are talking LIVES here, and it was such a simple thing she should have done."
"I read it as they were only searching for her 2 days after arrival?, why would it take that long? Surely she would have come into contact with lots of people by then and maybe she didn't realise she had to give the address of her 2nd accommodation. On the immigration forms there isn't room to do that. Someone on the Facebook page was contacted after a few days to quarantine too, if they are going to contact trace from the plane I think it should be much quicker."
"U.K. Every single visitor who arrives from the U.K. has to be monitored for two weeks . This means that on arrival , they give their address and contact number to the Ministry and undertake to take their temperature twice a day and report in with it daily . After 5 to 7 days they re given the opportunity to take anther test , and if it is negative they can carry on with their holiday wit no mote reports .  Obviously if you give your address to the Ministry and change it during the monitoring period , you have to notify them .  If this person was actually supposed to be in quarantine at a certain address and she didn’t notify them , well that is down right stupid and selfish as she may turn out to have Covid 19 after all ."
"Ah yes I was forgetting about the monitoring, but isn't that via WhatsApp anyway. I still think if it is taking 2 days to contact trace it's too long, by that time people could have mixed with all and sundry."
"No it’s not via what’s App and if this woman moved out with no forwarding address then they did jolly well to trace her in two days . Actually I would think that the Barbados contact Tracing is one of the more superior in the world . It certainly beats the English system hands down by what I hear and read .Edited: 3:51 pm, August 30, 2020 "
"Basically it means that this woman didn’t call in on day one because she had gone , or if in quarantine , the Ministry arrived to find her gone and on day two they looked for her and found her ."
"Thank you for your post Emma, always good to hear someones personal experience. Unfortunately UK the contact tracing is taking forever. Someone we know was contacted via track and trace as someone sitting near them on a european flight back to the UK had tested positive. They were contacted 8 days after the flight and were told they needed to quarantine for 14 days from the date of the flight, obviously impossible if you are only contacted 8 days after the flight! They had a test immediately and quarantined for the next 6 days even though the test was negative.Donna"
"That’s ok U.K. Reading it again , Emma’s post said the lady moved 2 days into her stay and the Ministry could not contact her , and they arrested her at 10 pm so it looks like she wasn’t “ on the loose “ for 2 days and the Ministry did their job very efficiently ."
"I thought that wasn't you Bimfan , totally different way of posting and the Avatar threw me lol  I'm not sure how you report it. Does anyone know ??"
"All contact we had from the track and trace / government officials was via what’s app .Also the track & trace only contact who they want to , I believe through not wanting businesses on the island to suffer . We gave a list of the places we had been before receiving the call to tell us to isolate including a restaurant we are in on our first night - they were never contacted - we know this as we asked them once we had been given our negative test papers and were allowed out again."
"Oh Emma, this is going Oh so wrong , but I do know that people without Android or I phones are being contacted with , or contacting, normal phone numbers . I really worry that until the Government back down on testing before arrival , chaos will ensue. Sorry you were part of it.  Things would be so much more simple if , returning Nationals had to pay to be tested here because then, they would stop flying without getting tested first, and all other passengers should have no choice. No test,no flight."
I do hope they get something in place with the testing as I can see it all going so horribly wrong over the coming months. I wonder what will be in October when the tourist season really gets going. We were due to fly back on December 18th but sadly have just cancelled today - I don’t think I could cope with the stress again so soon !!
"As always, and as I have said before, up to 30% of my clients who travel from the UK cannot get their test results in time to fly. In the US and Canada that number is higher. They can have it done 72 hours before indeed, but between one on 3 and one in 4 in the UK do not get the tets in time, through no fault of their own. If we are to bar them from travel as they stressfully await their non appearing certificates, and take their money, then people like myself in the business have to reluctantly say to our clients 'under no circumstances come here' unless you are happy to lose your money and be barred from travel. in a 30% chance. As we also know, today's cases include half of whom are re-tests! Many have come in with negative certificates...and then later found to be positive. There is no point calling for government to change this because it is not possible right now here without completely ending the tourist industry while it applies. We are not living in the future and what might occur then, we are all dealing with today's world.The real key to all of this is not whether these rules are justified or not, whether indeed they save lives or not. It is that an over reliance upon unclear rules, which then filter out (often in an extreme version) that say you could be locked up for 2 weeks through no fault of your own will act as a massive disincentive. It is a purely bloodless and non-judgmental argument - people indeed will be virtuous and say ""I quite agree, they should be hardline, they should lock her up and throw away the key/whatever""...but most travellers will take from that ""do not go, we will help Barbados by ending the tourist industry for the foreseeable future"".Another poster on here was full of praise for government being so hardline...and then after she made that comment she added: ""but of course that means we will not come out this year"". Go figure, as our American cousins might say. If we are so terrified of the virus that we do not want visitors or anyone coming for the next (fill in the period - 3 months, 6 months, year, more?), we must be honest and say so and close the entire island and suffer the tsunami that will hit us. We had no cases only when we had no flights. Fairly easy if you are an island. The more flights and visitors we have the more cases we will have. But we cannot ask people to come, not be clear about the rules for fear of putting them off and then potentially shoot ourselves in the foot by locking up people with negative results."
"Thank you for posting this. This confirms what I thought we have a booking for 3 weeks at Christmas and I am cancelling it in the morning. I was on the fence but this has made my mind up. Like many here, we have travelled forover 10 years to the island and I agree that everyone is always lovely in Barbados however a friend of mine our there echoed your sentiments Emma on the phone last week about growing unfriendliness. She said they desperately need the money tourism brings but are stuck between a rock and a hard place in terms of feeling that tourism is the enemy in terms of the spread of COVID yet needing it to live. I understand how scary this this must be for them but as another poster on here said it is not worth my money or my stress so sadly I need to find a Christmas destination I feel safe in. I think many will look at which European destinations are open and ready the week before and just book a flight! Good luck to you Emma and thank you again for sharing"
"If people arrive with negative tests from a country that is not high risk and then are staying at a villa of their choice that they have paid for it would be really excessive to make them move to an approved place just because they sat near someone who was positive on the plane. Just like they ran out of thermometers they soon would run of approved accommodations. There needs to be more understanding of potential to getting the virus and appropriate action. It is unlikely you can transmit it with short interaction with someone who is positive. It is unlikely you will transmit it to someone sitting two rows away. Is there any evidence of any transmission like this? We have to update protocols everywhere to reflect what we learn on a continual basis. Barbados seems to be in a over restrained state. Yes there are individuals who need to take extra precautions but the level of total quarantine enforced is disproportionate with real danger. There is danger in everyday life. We need to find reasonable risk standards. I know there are people on this forum who totally disagree with this but this is not an isolated opinion. BTW I practice mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing, etc very carefully. And I plan to continue until I am able to be vaccinated. But every country needs to figure out how to not completely destroy their economy in order to avoid risk of anyone, no matter how remote, getting this virus"
"Emma, thanks for your post. I feel so sorry for you and your family with what’s happened and really through no fault of your own. I agree with Verona that in cases like this the Protocols seem to be over-strict. Some travellers will be put off visiting Barbados again if treated so badly. I hope the powers that be read this and try to amend them even slightly. I do realise they’re there to protect the Bajan people and agree with most of it but surely this can’t keep happening. Testing at the departure airport is maybe the answer as has previously been said."
"Interesting story - really sorry to hear that happened! It was a risk that we were well aware of when we travelled on 15th August, just landed back in the UK with BA this morning - we actually found that we were sitting next to a family that had not tested prior to departure - luckily we assume they tested negative, as we did not hear anything further.I must say that we had a fantastic holiday in Barbados and found the people to be more welcoming than ever. The authorities however are running the risk of being too strict on business, with government 'secret shoppers' actively looking to close businesses at the slightest breach of protocol. People are fearful for their jobs and futures - frankly for many there is no future unless they get the tourists back to the island, we heard stories of landords evicting tennants on to the streets, the taxi driver we had for Silve Moon cruise told us it was only his 4th job since March / Silver Moon staff only 2nd cruise since the lockdown etc.It is worth pointing out that although Emmas story is horrendous, this is the exception, the vast majority of people are not affected in this way.Please do not be put off by this story - Barbados needs the UK visitors - if you cancel, you may find many of the places that you love in Barbados are just not there and have closed when you get the confidence to return.We were so reassured by the whole experience from travel from the UK / to plane / Barbados immigration and the experience on the island that we booked more flights for Easter."
".#29 #32 #33#metooAnd thank you, EmmaSo sorry that you’re getting some insensitive feedback.."
"Discerning Joe your account just makes me even more convinced they have to make a negative covid test mandatory before flight. I honestly think it would be a huge boost for tourism, it would take away this fear of getting sat next to a positive on the plane. Your story of local businesses makes me so sad, I really fear where all of this will end."
"UKtripfan - totally agree that the negative test pre flight should be mandated, there appears to be a gap here with the airlines - I dont think its going to change soon. The situation for local people will get much worse when the 'furlough' type scheme ends next month, this is when the mass layoffs will happen from the big hotels etc, so we heard from people we spoke with - this season is crucial for Barbados. Also I didnt realise how importand the cruise ships are to the island, these not sailing is a huge blow."
.#70You might have been telling a different story had those passengers next to you on the aircraft tested positive instead of negative. You were very lucky. Emma not so..
"Yes we were disgusted that others may have put us at risk of quarantine, however if we look at the data one can get it in to perspective, the number of people with Covid in the UK is very low, less than 20 per 100,000, the chances of 'that' person sitting next to you on a plane is negligible, therefore its a risk worth taking - to be honest I worried about it for a few minutes when we saw them taking the other queue and then forgot about it. Stories like Emmas are terrible and these are the ones we hear about - people should also hear the great stories of the other 99% that went to Barbados and had no problems and a great holiday.However the above does not change the broad agreement that pre flight tests should be mandated..."
"Sadly it is not 99% of people getting to enjoy their holiday. On our flight there were 2 positive cases out of approx 260 people this will have meant approx 60 people that day being isolated.You only have to check the loop news to see how many cases on each flight. Yesterday -30th August another 2 on a British Airways flight tested positive this again impacts on many of those seated by them being quarantined for their holiday too . You were just lucky on your flight, who knows next time...."
"Hi Emma, sorry to hear about your holiday. I am currently in the isolation facility and I would like to tell anyone who is planning to travel to Barbados soon, DO NOT DO IT. It is not worth it. I got dragged out in the middle of the night (tested positive at airport, even though I had a negative test from UK from two days before and was asymptomatic), and taken to Harrison Point. My partner was not allowed to join me, instead he had to quarantine for a week at a designated hotel, he was not allowed to got to his house that is detached and empty. So I was picked up by a guy in a hazmat suit and driven to this old former prison at 2am in the night all alone, all I was told is that I have to stay here for eight days at the least. I will not be released until I have two negative tests, in which one will be taken in eight days, and the other (if negative) after 24 hours. HOWEVER. If it is positive, the clock starts again, and I will not get another test for another eight days. There are people here who have been ""locked in"" for weeks, completely asymptomatic. This is the most distressing situation I have ever been in, I feel like a prisoner. You are not given any information. You do not get any one on one time with a doctor. You are not talked through your test. There is no reasoning.There are so many people here with horror stories of being dragged away from their families in the midle of the night and I just heard of a family where a mother was quarantined with her four kids, in one room. Because the mother tested positive and was symptomatic, they were completely isolated and not allowed to leave the room, not even for fresh air. One of the kids were autistic as well and it was just a horrible situation all around. Luckily the husband managed to jump on a plane from UK and take the kids out of the facility after a few days. There is also some doubt about how they are reading the tests here. Just yesterday a doctor from London arrived, he had a negative test on arrival, and he also proof that he had indeed tested positive for Covid-19 back in March. He also had a positive antibody test and several negative Covid tests since. Unfortunately his cautious mother-in-law wanted him to take another test here in Barbados just to be sure, and out of the blue - he tests positive. He has tried to explain this, but there is no trying to reason with the doctors and nurses here, you get put here and your test is in 7-10 days end of discussion. So unless this doctor is the first person who has had Covid - created antibodies and then contracted it again, something must be wrong with these test. A theory is that whilst in UK and other countries they can differentiate between a ""dead virus"" (you have had the virus, you are healthy, but your body still has traces) and a live virus. So if you have had it before and is super healthy, you might still risk having to isolate. I myself am pretty sure I had it back in March as well as I lost my sense of taste and smell for two weeks, unfortunately unessential workers were not a priority for testing at that time, so I don´t have a test confirming this. Whilst I understand that the government has to be cautious, this seems excessive and is extremely distressing to anyone who is here. In any other country 14 days self-isolation is sufficient. Why do we have to be taken to a prison? We should be trusted to do the right thing and isolate in our own accommodation. Especially those who are asymptomatic, as most studies indicate that you are much less likely to spread the virus. I have many more horror stories and from the bottom of my heart, I wish I had never sat foot on the plane to Barbados. Had I known I was risking incarceration I would have never done it. Please please please, cancel your ticket. - P"
"Oh my god pia I am so sorry and only wish I could help you. I cannot even begin to think how anxious you must be in this situation, you are living the nightmare I dreaded if we tested positive. I have read up on the facility over the last couple of weeks once we had been quarantined and spent every minute just hoping it would not happen.Are you kept on your own ? Or are you allowed to be around others? Your story is good to be on here as many people travelling will have no idea of the reality of the facility as here in the U.K. we would be free to stay and isolate at home not taken to prison ."
that is the most horrifying account I have read Pia - I thought that Harrison's point had been turned into a proper Hospital - with proper doctors and nurses to care for folks who are ill with C19 - - not just a place to be locked up in - thank you for writing - I will remain back in the cold and not risk a trip to my winter home - absolutely terrifying account - so sad for you - Hope you get got soon!
"That is absolutely horrendous PSoe and worrying about the tests. I truly hope that your situation gets better and that you don’t have to stay in there any longer than you have to. I have a question for you, if you had proof of a negative test from the UK, why did you have to do another at the airport? are they randomly testing a percentage of people who have already come through with the ‘test within 72 hours proof’. I was under the impression (perhaps wrongly) that if you had proof you were waved though and if you didn’t you got tested at the airport? Emma’s issue was because the person who sat next to her didn’t bother to get tested before hand and when they tested positive the officials came to her afterwards at her accommodation.. Are they then automatically retesting people who have sat around your seat, just because somebody hasn’t had the test is in your row. If that is the case by not having the test before hand, at the very least you are causing a massive disruption to those people sitting near you if you cause them to get retested at the airport when you have already done it."
"#77 Wow - that is an outrage, so sorry - there is no way that any government should be treating people in the way that you have been, horrifying and has rings of a Communist State. Its the government response that will kill Barbados rather than the virus itself."
Having read these 2 accounts from Emma and Pia I am so glad we cancelled. I wasn't prepared to risk the £7000 we paid on a sub-par experience but I now realise that things could be oh so much worse than I had forecast. No-one should be travelling under these circumstances unless they are either returning home or long stay residents for whom a couple of weeks loss of freedom isn't an issue.
This video has some information on Harrison's Point Isolation and Quarantine facility https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtabcbAB95I and there are several others on youtube. And this guy shared his experience of being isolated at Paragon - another facility https:/… - again there are multiple stories on google. Neither are currently operating as prisons. I think it's important to show different perspectives. Those unfortunate to be caught up in the middle of this mess are obviously going to have their perspective and those that are asymptomatic are not going to want to be isolated. But I don't think it's fair to label these places as prisons - these facilities have saved lives.
"PSoe, I am so sorry this has happened to you but please may I ask you why you were tested at the Airport when you had a valid Negative test------------or was it not valid ?  Harrisons Point, used to be an Army Barracks ,but please realise that millions of dollars have been spent to turn it into an Isolation Hospital for people suffering from Covid 19. Is it really so uncomfortable ? . I ask because when I watched a program about it on the TV , it looked fine to me ?  If you are Asymptomatic, you still have covid 19 and as such, you would be a danger to all those around you visitors and locals alike , and to trust you to totally self isolate when you are on holiday and feeling well, would be a tall order. Perhaps , as you say, you could be trusted, but I'm totally sure others could not, so proper isolation is the only answer .The Government is totally transparent about the amount of people in Harrisons Point at any one time , it's in the newspaper and on the TV daily . Today there are 21 positive cases at Harrisons Point one of which is sadly you, and 4 people left yesterday after recovering from Covid 19. The number of people bringing it into Barbados mainly on BA and Jet Blue is also reported daily . Yesterday three people entered isolation having been tested positive on arrival on BA and Caribbean Airways. You might be interested to hear that before the country opened up to International flights we had been Covid free for over 6 weeks , however, it was obvious that people who were infected would arrive , so precautions had to be set in place, otherwise this small Island , praised by other countries for it's handling of the virus, would be over run and many deaths may occur . We have a large percentage of elderly people here and the 7 sad deaths so far in a small population is enough.  I am wondering where the figure of 60 people in quarantine on each plane where a case is confirmed comes from ? Is there proof of this, because if it were true, I should imagine Social media would be rife with stories as well as this forum -----------------is it ? This bloody virus is ruining everyone's life , and travel is a risk, I'm a bit scared to fly to the UK at Christmas, but meanwhile what are the odds that ones holiday is ruined apart from for long stayers , compared with the odds that one could be run over on the street, be diagnosed with one of the many life threatening diseases that everyone seems to have forgotten ( except those suffering from them ) or simply die in a car accident. We all take risks every day and Barbados is taking a whacking great risk , but for those who love it here, as someone has already pointed out, the next time you feel totally safe to fly, there will be nothing left that you loved apart from a lot of poor people who have nothing. I just hope there are enough risk taking Barbados lovers left who will come and help keep this beautiful Island afloat . I hope you recover soon PSoe, and get to enjoy the rest of your holiday . Good luck."
Westie iam glad you are applying some skepticism to some of the odd statements being made that go against reason and what is public fact.In the last few months it seems anyone making outlandish comments doesn't seem to stick around or even attempt to validate the things they say.They stir up these forums then vanish into thin air. Iam all for believing that people are good and honest but sadly the world is no longer so simple.If some of the things beings said are truthful my heart goes out to them however. Using a few comments from random strangers who can make up anything they like as a basis not to visit somewhere is pretty foolhardy.
"Why on earth would I come on here and make outlandish comments , what happened to us over the past 10 days was very real and I am only speaking from experience. I haven’t posted and vanished and have given a very clear list of events.You should see it as a positive that we are letting you know how tourists are being treated on your island as I don’t think all the information you are given as residents from the government is truthful.I have been on trip advisor many years and contributed to a huge amount of positive feedback from some wonderful trips to the island , which has always been one of our favourite places in the world.I only want this forum to be helpful to others who may be as unlucky as we were or to help them postpone their trip until the government put in better protocols on entrees coming in to be tested. I am sure there will be many more forums written by the passengers who have been unfortunate enough to come into contact with positive COVID-19 people travelling in without tests . We met 19 others from our plane at the Randall’s Phillips poly clinic where Dr.Barry ward tested us in Oistins , Amoy our our government health contact information officer told us there were others from our flight in different districts being tested at other clinics however did not give us an exact figure only approximately 30."
"how shocking this is, totally agree with DiscerningJoe awful treatment by the government almost barbaric,nobody should be treated that way."
"I was not referring to your situation given that i was responding to westie and the comments below theirs.I would pose a question to you however what do you realistically think shouldve been done in your case?It was a know fact before you left that testing before flight wasnt mandatory so complaining about it now is a mute point. Isolating persons with close contact of a positive case is standard operating procedure in most countries. Several new clusters around the world were caused by persons not isolating correctly so clearly you cant be left to isolate on your own without a massive risk to the general population.I honestly what to know how you feel your situation could have been handled better?Edited: 12:31 pm, yesterday "
"Emma, I don't think anyone is saying what you have written is untrue,although I do challenge the figure of 60 people per plane being quarantined , and are you sure all 30 were all on your flight , or could your contact perhaps have included people on Jet Blue ,Virgin, Caribbean Airways etc. ? What happened to your family was very upsetting and very sad,but these are upsetting and sad times wherever you are in the World. What I have issue with is a rather hysterical post calling a brand new Specialist hospital a Prison ,although I quite understand that being isolated anywhere is similar to being in prison . However the difference between a real Prison and a state of the art specialist Hospital is considerable even if the Hospital isn't luxury level, the fact is, it is fully able to deal with Covid sufferers and has ample ICU units to cope and a team of specially trained Medical staff. . Harrison's Point, is , as Yodacat says, saving lives, and to insult it and it's marvellous team who like health care workers in the UK , Canada and most countries , put themselves on the line every day, is indefensible IMO.. Of course , to be taken there by someone in a hazmat suit ( why so surprised ? ) is annoying to those concerned, but the reason is THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM COVID 19 and they are A RISK to EVERYONE THEY MEET in Barbados. What is so difficult to understand ? Would you rather find yourself sitting next to one of them on the beach or in a bar or restaurant ?"
"It’s as simple as testing everyone before they travel .I know people could still be positive upon arrival as it may not show up on the first test however it would reduce the cases . This would benefit the tourism and help protect the islanders from so many cases . It is inevitable that the island is going to be hit hard with covid-19 in the coming months if they continue to run the current protocols. You as islanders have complete faith in the system at Harrison’s point which I’m sure is doing a really good job at treating patients currently, I’m not so sure it will eventually cope if these flights keep bringing in positive cases as the rest of the world is finding out.Regarding how many people are quarantined near the infected individual on the plane also depends on who you are travelling with , for instance myself , partner and our youngest son were sat in close proximity however my other son and his girlfriend were not but obviously all have to quarantine as we had been together upon arrival. So numbers depend on how big your travelling party is."
"An answer to the problems of sitting next to somebody on the plane could be addressed by the airlines if they really wanted to. Whatever their protocol for quarantine is (with regards the number of people next to the positive case) let’s say 2 rows for arguments sake. In each section and I am particularly thinking economy here, could be less in PE or Upper/business class. Don’t sell 2 rows out of each section and get everyone to upload their negative results a specified number of hours before. Stop pre booking of specific seats and allocate them, keeping families together. You could then have the number of people who haven’t pre tested sat at the back of that section with 2 empty rows, ensuring that nobody who has obtained the results pre flight sits with the untested ones, I bet that it would also motivate a lot of people to do that bit extra to get their tests beforehand, if they thought that they were going to be seated around others that were untested. It also means that with the only small risk that your results Don’t come back on time you would still be able to board the plane, the same goes if your results come back as inconclusive. Nobody is then denied boarding but you don’t run the risk of quarantine if you have got your tests back.Of course my argument totally falls apart if you get tested again despite having a valid test within the required time frame, that is particularly why I was interested to hear back from Psoe to find out why they were tested again at the airport despite having proof of negative testing 2 days before."
I forgot to add if they needed to charge more to make this commercially viable then so be it. If people want to travel they will pay it. Operating with fewer seats has to be better than not operating at all. I would rather pay an extra few hundred for a bit more reassurance that my luxury holiday didn’t go down the pan.
"Most of us agree that no one should fly without a test Emma,but apparently , in some places it is not easy or even possible to get one at least in the time period, so the Government feel they cannot preclude people from coming if they want to,  Maybe things will change if it starts to get too bad, only time will tell. Meanwhile the people of Barbados are suffering , not from Covid, but from a new ""virus "" which may be named ""mass cancellations"" Lets pray this virus doesn't become too rife.Sjr76 -----------------good idea !Edited: 12:58 pm, yesterday "
I think all of those ideas are great . We would definitely have paid more to ensure safer travel and a holiday at the end of the flight!
If I could be locked up for sitting near the wrong person on a plane then I'm not going to travel be it Barbados or Bognor Regis. So if Barbados wants more of my money (they have had plenty over the twenty years that I've been going there including our wedding at Tamarind (Cove) eighteen years ago (still together) they need to find a solution that doesn't leave me locked up in an institution. A room at the Crane with access to the lovely historic pool is at least a better option.
"John,why do you think you would be locked up in an institution ? What ever are you talking about ?  If you arrived with a negative test from the UK, you would go your your Hotel as usual and just take your temperature twice a day, simples.  If you are unfortunate as Emma was, and you sit near an untested person on the plane who proves to be Positive at the Airport, you will have to Quarantine either at your Hotel, ( if they agree to let you ) and not leave your comfortable room until you have provided another negative test after a few days . OR you can indeed pay to go to the Crane and Quarantine there. Their rooms have individual pools you can still use.  The only way you would wind up in Isolation at Harrison's Point hospital ( not Institution ) is if you fly without a test and then test positive when you arrive OR you catch the virus from a passenger on the plane and test Positive in Quarantine. The Hospital is PURELY for patients with the Covid 19 virus , no one else."
Thanks Emma for taking the time to post your report. There certainly are a few horror stories about at the minute. We fly out on Saturday morning on BA and hopefully by Saturday evening we’ll be sitting at Surfside enjoying a few socially distanced rum sours.
"I really hope so , as that’s what we believed too....I do not wish upon anyone what happened to our vacation."
"Thank you Emma and PSoe for taking the time to post your experiences. Neither of you deserve the negative remarks or being made fun of. Both are shocking and serve to remind us of the risks anyone takes to travel at this time. For anyone to book a 14 day or less holiday is IMO foolish given the chances that you could spend that time in isolation or quarantine. For a gov't official to take you to Harrison Point at 2 am in that manner is over the top and totally unnecessary. I wonder if Mia knows her gov't servants are under such direction and acting in such an unnecessary manner? I can see visiting you at 5 or 6 am or something but not 2 am. What do they expect you to do at that time, run around the resort coughing and sneezing on everyone???PSoe, you are still in the facility please take puctures and post here to end the conflicting descriptions of Harrison Point. If you don't know how to do that mssg me.Thanks again to both of you for your reports.Do you not think it is to the government's advantage to be vague about the protocols?Edited: 3:35 pm, yesterday "
For the near and extended future these scenarios will become more common place to one degree or another I believe. I can see this becoming more common place as seasons change and possible second waves truely hit.This is an extreme case but an example of how a whole plane is quarantined-https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-53970217
"Hi Emma- How soon after your flight were you notified? We just had family fly in yesterday and haven't heard anything yet, doing a 7 day quarantine (until second test). Saw only one positive for the day yesterday so should be good I'd say... unless there could be a delay. In my opinion, positive asymptomatic cases should be quarantined in place vs isolated as the science now indicates asymptomatics are not ferocious spreaders unless intra-family. Beyond the above id say it's likely already here on the island spreading and being spread. Thankfully its not the killer we were told it might be at the beginning and hopefully cooler heads prevail around the world. Hard though, it will take powerful people to admit they were wrong before we get to that stage."
Momolpas----------------please present evidence that Covid 19 is being Community spread on the Island .
"We arrived on the 18th at 3pm and were contacted on the 19th at 11.30am .However there was a second positive on our flight , who didn’t show as positive until the 2nd test on Friday 21st when they quarantined the next British airways passengers who incidentally Some had traveled the island on buses & taxis from Bridgetown to Oistins to Bathsheba and had been on excursions and eaten out for the past 3 nights . I’m struggling to see how the authorities will contain this on the island forever even with track & trace ."
"Westie---- didnt say it was, just that ""in my opinion"" it's likely. How often are islanders tested outside of those directly involved in the response?"
"People are really wondering why Barbados has chosen to isolate those who test positive? Have you seen what other people are doing around the world? Do you really think people will ""do the right thing"" on holiday unless made to? Allowing people who are positive to ""shelter in place"" is a surefire way to completely lose control of this virus.The issue of whether this virus is really such a big deal is a different topic altogether. The fact of the matter is that at this point in time Barbados has chosen to treat it like a big deal, and therefore the protocols have been designed to minimize risk as much as possible while still allowing some activity. I personally am hopeful that this virus is mutating towards a milder form, as evidenced by falling hospitalization rates in many places, and maybe we can loosen up some more in time. Note I said ""hopeful"" - not sure we're there yet."
"Westie. In my view a hospital which you forced to go to and not allowed out of is not a hospital it is an institution. You're view may be different and you may see the rules as necessary to protect the good people of Barbados. As I see it if I pick up the damn virus between my test and entering Barbados I might end up stuck in the ""hospital"" or as my partner said ""Black Rock"".A twixmas in a nice hotel in the YUK this year I'm afraid. At least I can get home if it goes pear shape."
"Westie I also believe that covid could sadly be on island already. Asymptomatic people could easily slip through even with the protocol in place. Medium risk traveler comes through with negative test 72 hours prior and never has temperature to report. Or slight temperatures are not reported accurately or honestly. A traveler or resident is only slightly ill (as most people are) and they ignore symptoms they dont want to ruin a vacation or miss work. So no ""evidence"" its there but I believe those scenarios highly likely. Eventually there will be community spread and some sick enough that the evidence will come."
"Thats interesting Emma- so when a person tests positive on a second test, are they still tracing all his/her close contacts on the plane? Surely at that point all they have to do is test them? It will have been 5 days from flight so any transmission would have occurred already.Its been sad to see what panic, fear and irrational leadership throughout the world ""powers"" is doing as a knock on effect to places like this."
"Yes they still track & trace even after 3 days , however they quarantined them until the 7th day when they were then tested. However even having a negative test on the 7th day does Not mean you are covid free- hence why in the rest of the world quarantine is 14 days .As I quoted from the Barbados Loop news before the Ghanaian nurse was not positive until the 10th day .Edited: 5:06 pm, yesterday "
"just read PSoe account, quite harrowing and I hope some of it is frankly not true. If you test positive 7-10 days later you have to wait 7 days to be tested again? nightmare. you should have the option to at least pay for tests at a better frequency.Again, if that's true, I've seen NOTHING about isolation protocol once at the facility. The scenario that you could be stuck there literally one week at a time before your tested again... that would have deterred me completely. This should be laid out somewhere officially.Edited: 5:30 pm, yesterday "
"On another note the air stewards / stewardesses do not have to isolate or quarantine if working on a flight with a positive passenger, they still fly back on the returning aircraft (speaking about British Airways ) as I asked on our return flight. British Airways currently use The Hilton hotel pebbles beach. I am sure locals who work at this hotel are from all over the island ?"
We asked to be tested privately and were just told no it is not a possibility.
"Westie that may be what the regulations say and what is written on paper,but there seems to be conflicting reports about A LOT of things going on and I don’t know how anyone could reasonably know what to expect upon landing at GA airport.Allowing non-tested passengers to line up with tested passengers?Everyone on the same shuttle bus?There are far too many variables to know how you are going to be handled when you arrive.I respectfully repeat what I’ve said a few times on this forum-given the severity of the virus and the manner in which Barbados wants to protect its’ citizens(which I fully understand and respect),in my opinion this is just not the right time to consider flying to the island(or anywhere else internationally),some things are not meant to be.You can’t protect the 280,000 people on the island AND have tourists from other countries(some that do not have proper measures in place to begin with)co-mingle on an airplane and import the virus as they arrive,it just doesn’t work.."
Well let's just hope that the welcome stamp can fill the gap and keep us going - some people are already here and the various chat groups are quite active.
"Thanks Emma, I am glad you got your family out and that you don´t have to go through this, thought I am sure it was extremely hard being quarantined in your hotel room for eight days as well with all the uncertainty. Did you ask to get tested before the 7th day? Thanks for asking, luckily there are other people here that we are allowed to speak to, but we are all struggling to cope with the lack of information and feeling rather helpless at the moment. Feels like the only thing we can do right now is warn others as we would not wish this on our worst enemy. I was reading the comments to my post to the others here earlier and everyone lit up when they heard Anothersadowner has postponed their trip, if we can save at least one person from this place we can sleep a little better at night."
"Hi Sjr76, The reason why I had to retest in Barbados is because unfortunately my NHS test did not come back in time for when we landed (should have gone private). When it did come back two days later it was negative. Of couse we could have avoided boarding the plane, but we were optimistic that we would get it by the time we landed in Barbados as that would have made it around 70 hours since testing and NHS says most tests are back within 72 hours. Of course if you have a negative test on hand you will be let in the country, but as Emma experienced, you might still need to quarantine and do a new test if you have been on the plane with someone who tests positive, thus you are risking going to an isolation facility for eight days minimum. Had I done my research properly (or the Basian government had laid it straight in their travel advise) I would have never taken the risk. I just hope my experience can at least make people aware of what they are risking by travelling to Barbados at this time."

"P Soe, please publish photographs of the terrible "" prison "" you are being held in for everyone to see. The fact is, you tested Positive and have the virus. If you dispute this then demand another test early. If it's negative, you can go on your merry way.Edited: 8:38 pm, yesterday "
"PSoe if you were tested at the airport how is it they let you leave the airport before the test results were available? The protocol was test at airport stay at airport until results are ready. If you choose off site testing you go to a specified hotel, quarantine there until results are ready. Has the protocol changed?"
"Thank you so much for all you understanding and sympathy guys, really means a lot.Thank you Westiegal3, please see my reply to Sjr76 regarding the test. Of course every country is in its right to protect its citizens however they see fit, my problem here is rather the lack of information and how they are encouraging tourist to come, without proper highlighting the risk they are taking by coming, as mentioned by NortherCanuck1 – it is definitely to the governments advantage to be vague about the protocols. I.e the UKs gov site simply states: “• Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be placed in isolation until they have recovered• Persons may be required to quarantine at any stage of their visit if the Government of Barbados deems that you have come into close contact with a COVID-19 positive individualThis is pretty standard for most countries, but I guess the magic word here is “placed”. I still find this very misleading and would like for there to be a greater emphasis on the fact that that isolation is indeed in a gated military base, and that you risk staying here for weeks. They do not follow the WHO 14 day quarantine rule, so you could risk staying here for months. This is especially risky if you are travelling as a family as the virus can spread between you, for example a family who just got released had stayed here for four weeks as the virus had transferred between the kids and parents at different times. Also, to your comment about my frustration about being picked up at 2am by a guy in a hazmat suit, apparently the reason why they do this is because big hotels like the Crane do not want the pickup to be upsetting to other guests. So as to not inconvenience other tourists the government has decided to completely disregard how distressing the situation is for the individual.I am sorry if I have offended you Westiegal3, but I am simply writing about my experience. I do wish your country the best and hope you manage to recover quickly. I am sure that I want to return at one point (still haven´t seen the beach!) but I will not be back until Covid-19 is nothing but a mere bad memory. Take care!Thank you JohnCamberleyUK for your understanding, I think you are making a good decision staying home or choosing a different destination for you Christmas trip. It´s simply not worth the risk!Edited: 9:07 pm, yesterday "
"Thank you for your understanding peesoh but photos of the hospital you are trying to bring into disrepute would still be helpful .  Also an explanation of how you got to the Crane when you tell us you were tested positive at the Airport would be useful as this is against all written Protocols .   Telling us what was different about your situation would help a lot of people .Edited: 9:15 pm, yesterday "
"The government film of Harrisons Point that I saw did not show it properly occupied or in action, so it would be useful, Psoe, to see some photos as westie has asked. I think there needs to be more transparency about the place for sure, but some shots from you would help in our attempts. It might not show much (eg it cannot show the frustrations you are experiencing or the lack of communication etc), but it would help.Irrespective of this, the rules need to be clearer, and the implications of them - being carted off during the night to save embarrassment - are worrying I agree.Edited: 9:21 pm, yesterday "
"PSoe as I said earlier when I asked for pictures, if you don't know how to post send me a private message."
"Westiegal3, I am not sure if I am allowed to take photos as it is a government facility, but I will have a look into it. I don´t want to get in trouble while I´m still here and risk making my stay here more unpleasant. I was not staying at the Crane, I was staying at Worthing Court, one of the other designated quarantine hotels. We were allowed to stay there, quarantined in our room, until the test results came back 24hours later."
"PSoe, is anybody held at the facility actually ill?"
A £8000 holiday? around 10000 dollars?
"Yes £8000 - actually we spent more !!for 5 people - is that unusual?? This is the kind of money tourism brings to the island !! £4500 flights£2700 accommodation £3000 spendingDoesn’t matter what it cost you can still end up quarantined and loose your holiday!Edited: 2:43 am, today "
".#131It is VERY easy to spend a lot of money on a holiday on Barbados. Our 23-night visits always cost (c) £10k for the two of us. People can, and do, spend a lot less but flights, accommodation, and eating out at nice places soon adds up.A lot of money to put at risk at the moment. We certainly have no plans to return until this ghastly virus is eradicated or under control, which greatly saddens us.At the present we are lucky that we haven’t been affected by the virus and know of absolutely no-one at all who has - who, in turn, also don’t know of anyone who has. But, nevertheless, we all have that little bit of fear in us that makes us err on the side of caution...."
"PSoe,so sorry to hear of your terrible experience-thank you for sharing it here,I know many people will say it’s the exception not the rule,but we as travellers need to know ALL the risks and possible scenario’s caused by testing for the virus.We’ve been going to Barbados for the past 15 winters,always enjoy our break from the cold and the warmth of the Barbados sunshine and people,but the new reality,at least for this winter,is not safe enough for us to board a plane to anywhere,not just due the strict protocols that are in place.The government is just trying to protect their people,I can’t argue with that,it makes sense-but unfortunately it won’t encourage tourism-very hopeful for 2022..Thank you for the information you provided."
"Psoe why couldn't you message NorthernCanuk1 last night ? - do they turn off the wifi?/power? - I am very curious as to exactly what the conditions are at Harrison's Point - I had thought it was turned into a real normal hospital - with Doctors to visit with patients etc.... - so all info is very helpful - (I normally spend the entire winter in my home on the island - but won't be this winter unless there is a vaccine!)Edited: 7:21 am, today "
Anyone booking a trip to Barbados at the moment probably should visit that mental hospital westie talked about! Crazy to visit an island treating tourists in this way at the moment! Fully respect how Barbados has handled covid but clearly it’s not ready for tourists or doesn’t want tourists right now. Thank you to the people posting about their personal experiences. Hopefully it’s an eye opener for those thinking of going!
"Oh how I long for the days when my biggest concern was avoiding a sewage leak...trying to avoid sargassum, or dodge a possible tropical storm. Those things at the time were worrisome. Now they seem so minimal. Least you could plan around them. Travel now is so messy..so uncertain and potentially so unsafe. You have to be 100% informed and no room for ""whoops I didnt know that"" and there is no learning as you go with minimal consequence. I have had no serious thoughts of travel but pleasant day dreams. After reading these first hand accounts seems the possibility of a nightmare is very real. I appreciate the shared information and the thoughts of those making us all think deeper. Hopefully this long information filled thread will help some make an educated choice and do what's best for them."
"Yes it's an outrage. In a country that does not have free healthcare, Barbados is currently offering free testing at the airport and if you should become sick with Covid, they will do their utmost to try to help you recover - for free. If you should test positive with Covid and have to be isolated at their facility, they will accommodate and feed you for free - what an outrage. When all the other countries shut their doors to cruise ships, Barbados allowed them to dock and facilitated the repatriation of 1000s of people - what an outrage. The sense of entitlement of some people makes me sick."
"The horror story about separation from family and Harrison Point only materialised a few days ago. Many people (myself included) booked some time ago, or even post-COVID, but in the expectation that all those on a flight had presented with a negative test prior to departure. Would I book now? Definitely not. A harrowing situation, to say the least.I'd like to know more about the conditions at HP. If the situation is as harsh as the OP explains, tour operators/airlines should not be heading to Barbados at all. I'm not blaming the island though, perfectly understandable that they try and contain it."
"yodacat - I agree with your comments, but I think that's taking a lot of these posts out of context. Most (but not all) are not disputing whether the actions taken are appropriate for the island or in line with best measures to protect their people (clearly they are, some minor issues and gripes aside). But most of these posts are in a specific context - whether it is reasonable to expect people to pay 3-10k on a holiday with an a possibility of having to endure this kind of experience, half way across the world, potentially separated from family, no information etc.Consumers are not being made aware what precise conditions they may be subjected to. The guidance does not warn of these kind of situations. Most non-forum travellers will expect all passengers to hold a negative test and risk to be much closer to zero than is the case."
"Canbys Post 140is well written and so trueIn my mind I can’t imagine why anyone wants to travel during a PandemicThe hurdles to jump through, subjecting yourself and family to possible positive people on the airplane, we all enjoy our vacations But it is worth it or even Necessary now"
"<< “ Consumers are not being made aware what precise conditions they may be subjected to.” >>Anyone who chooses to travel currently is willingly “buying a pig in a poke” when it comes to “what precise conditions they may be subjected to” in Barbados or anywhere else. And, unless they don’t pay any attention to the news at all, should realize that everything is subject to change... and any change will not be favorable. “Ya pays yer money... ya takes yer chances.”Edited: 9:07 am, today "
"I said this before but it all comes back to the airlines not separating tested and not tested passengers on the plane. Barbados appears to have bent over backwards to keep their citizens safe and to try and reintroduce tourism, as other countries have across the world. Am I alone in thinking (after reading about lots of experiences) that all the airlines have done is say wear a mask, cut down on their services (food and drink) and bleated about getting government bailouts? To me getting the test within 72 hours Is a risk that I would absolutely be willing to take, we have said that if we get on a plane this year we are also going to quarantine ourselves for 2 weeks (we can work at home and get stuff delivered) so that we would be as low risk as it gets before sitting next to others on a plane and arriving in another country. After being as cautious as that and then getting lumped next to a non tested passenger is not fair as Emma found out. The airlines should seriously sort this out, it appears that many of them are not playing their part and just doing the bare minimum to fly passengers from a to b and collect the fares. Countries like Barbados are putting together a Herculean effort to restart tourism and the airlines need to step up to the plate and separate tested and non tested passengers (with unsold seats inbetween) so that the minute you step on to that flight with valid results in your hand, you know that you are free to go about your holiday as planned and get some sun on your skin (with the reporting procedures followed of course which seem no hassle at all)."
"Momalpas3, yes there are people here with symptoms but they are being held in a different building. I am not sure if there are people here who are seriously ill or if they get moved to the hospital. I got picked up with another young woman and she had lost her sense of smell and taste so she got taken to the medium-risk building where she has been confined to her room for the past four days. Uktripfan, thank you. This is what we are also worried about, especially when the doctor from London tested positive, despite having a positive Covid test from March and a positive antibody test AND negative test prior to arrival. Just seems unlikely that he would be one of the few people in the world who has contracted the virus twice, it´s much more likely that the tests here are picking up on the antibodies or something. Anothersadowner, I did message NorthernCanuk1 last night as luckily they do not turn of the power/wifi at night! I agree yodacat, crazy to think how much money they are spending on keeping asymptomatic people locked up with round the clock supervision and three daily meals. I have been fighting to get a new test before the eight days have passed (so has the doctor who most likely had a false positive) but they are very set on the 7-10 testing rule and will not look at each case individually. Mad to think you need two negatives to be released but only one positive to be put here for a minimum of eight days. I offered to pay for the test myself, but this was not an option. I am surprised that they are so adamant on keeping us here for this long, I understand that the tests are not free, but surely it costs them more to keep us here. Again, thanks everyone for your encouraging messages, I will keep you guys posted on my experience. Hopefully just five more days to go!"
"Unfortunately the government is between a rock and a hard place, in a way that the bigger countries who are not so dependent on tourism will never experience. On the one hand they need economic activity, but on the other they recognize 2 things: (1) the real risk to the health of the population, and (2) the perceived risk that the population has of their own risk. By the second point I mean the worry and sometimes downright panic that is evident every day when the Covid-19 situation is posted on the Government Information page. Bajans are watching the situation n Jamaica and Trinidad and are getting even more worried than before. People are scared enough with the isolation protocols at HP being what they are - I cannot imagine how people would react to a loosening of these protocols.We can argue about whether the protocols or tests are too ""strict"", but without clear evidence to support the further loosening our government just cannot do it."
"PSoe said "" I agree yodacat, crazy to think how much money they are spending on keeping asymptomatic people locked up with round the clock supervision and three daily meals."" You keep talking about being asymptomatic as though that means you do not have the virus . You DO have the virus, and should you not be kept in Isolation you would be a danger to others. You keep saying you would not break your isolation, but believe me others would. I would bet my house on that . The Ministry cannot take the risk and I for one feel much safer knowing that. I am Asthmatic and a prime subject to become very ill or die should I get Covid 19. I dread going to the UK for 4 weeks at Christmas because of the general attitude and actions of some of the British people I read about daily. What has happened to you is very unfortunate, but you continue to talk as though you are held in Gestapo type circumstances . ( "" I can't take photos because I don't want to get into trouble while I'm here and risk making my stay here more unpleasant "" ) If that was true, why have the 146 people who have been there and recovered not published their outrage and indignation on here or more common social media ? Have they all been held at gun point and ordered to keep quiet ?? You say you have Wi Fi all day long ---------------- something else for free , so that speaks to me of a facility that has nothing to hide and just wants to keep people safe."
Hi PsoeIt must be pretty awful locked up in the Isolation Facility no matter how good or otherwise it is.Have you read the FCO web site about wellbeing and mental health if you are stuck abroad.https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wellbeing-and-me…
"First sounds horrific experience, this makes me so sad that the world can’t sort out the restarting of tourism. I booked Barbados 10 days ago ( after cancelling and rebooking and canceling Mexico ) on the back on the arrangements in place to protect themselves and tourists such as having a negative test before boarding a plane and also stricter regimes for those from high risk countries. IMHO they have made the right noises but they need to see it through. While I understand that a COVID test is only negative on day it’s done, people going on holiday have paid a lot of money and want to enjoy their holiday, so will generally will be following the social distancing etc pretravel, then Barbados gov need to insist on a negative test before arriving and then ensure screening and social distancing are in place in all hotels bars restaurants etc, limiting indoors and increasing outdoor seating etc, this can be done, there is a risk but like everything in life the risks need to be balanced. Let’s keep the reports coming from travellers we need to here the positive and negative to be able to make informed decisions."
"Michelle for every person who is saying that a negative test should be mandatory before flying - which I agree - there is another that says we are either open or we are not. Some people even seem to think positive cases should be allowed to isolate in their holiday accommodation - ridiculous. We already have strict protocols in place for buildings, hotels, bars, restaurants etc and a Covid unit that actively monitors to make sure they are being followed... and then we have people ridiculing seeing people wearing masks whilst walking out on the street.... everything is damned if we do, damned if we don't. Can't please all people all of the time."
"I want to say a MASSIVE thank you to 5338Emma and PSoe for sharing the information about their experiences. While I completely understand that this is not the experience for most the fact that it is a possibility is enough reason for me to cancel my trip this month. Even though I had read all of the information on the BA website (which links to the official Barbados info page) and even though that page references both the quarantine and the hotel room isolation scenarios it didn't really hit me how this could become a reality. I was naively thinking that if I took my test in advance and arrived with the negative test I'd be fine. Emma's situation did not cross my mind and with no guarantees of turnaround time for COVID testing I'd be far too anxious to travel without test results given the situation PSoe is now in. I think the action being taken on the Island is in the best interest of the residents and rightly so as that should be their priority. I'm annoyed with BA, who when I spoke to them on the phone told me that all passangers required a negative test to board the plane (clearly not true), who are selling these vacations without any real warning regarding the scenarios described here. I'm not wiling to gamble thousands of pounds on a holiday that could result in me being locked in my room. That is just the reality of the situation and I certainly don't blame the Barbados procedures as I completely understand the need for them. Westiegal3 I can see you're getting quite agitated with some of the comments being posted but I think there are two sides here both with valid points. I would be horrified to be locked in any sort of hospital facility (no matter what standard) abroad by myself and I think your comments to PSoe come across overly defensive (if even a tad aggressive) when she is only trying to explain the situation she is in. I don't need to see pictures to know that I don't want to be in that position. I understand it's frustrating as you feel the guidelines are clear and that people have travelled to the island with full knowledge in advance however like I said I hadn't fully considered these scenarios even after reading the guidelines. That's on me (not Barbados) but still I appreciate the two examples that have been provided in this thread. I really hope to get to go to Barbados in the near future and will keep an eye on this forum so I can pick a time to travel when I feel more comfortable."
Oh my goodness that is terrifying.It’s just beyond words. A medical facility is one thing but an awful locked environment that locks up autistic children with no special needs workers to support or help the parents. Good God. I have been many many times to Barbados and even in a virus I never thought it could be such a place. All my many years there I just never imagine that kind of inhumanity - thank you so much for sharing - I am so happy I cancelled and I won’t be rebooking now
Some of these comments are just getting ridiculous now.
Agreed yodacat.
"Please clarify what you think is ridiculous, I think that people are just realising that there is a chance that they can be removed from their hotel and taken to a faxcility away from their families even though they have no symptoms and a negative test... if this is true tourism should be closed, if you open for tourism it’s a calculated risk that country takes, but you can’t open tourism and then treat people like this..... that’s not ok. And all we are asking as potential tourists is this needs to be communication to travel companies so they also make a decision to take people there or notEdited: 12:22 pm, today "
Keep posting and sharing - it’s important people know where they might end up. I’m so sorry again - sending you all the best
"Re #151,Karen B you have summarized things very well-can’t add anything except to say it’s a very unfortunate time and situation for both the fine people in Barbados,and those of us who visit often and now realize it’s not the right time to do so..."
"People are not ""taken away"" if they have a negative test - please don't spread misinformation. If you are contact traced because you were closely exposed to someone who tested positive you can isolate in place i.e. at your hotel. Yes it does limit your movements, that part is true. If you then have a positive test you will be taken to the isolation facility, mainly because human beings have shown over and over again that they cannot be trusted to follow instructions without serious oversight. We do not have the manpower to supervise positive people in their own accommodation.You are correct that in your travels, whether on the plane or otherwise, you could be exposed to the virus and become positive yourself. That has always been a reality of travel.Edited: 12:49 pm, today "
"Psoe didn't have a negative test on arrival and after being tested at the airport, the test results were positive resulting in isolation at Harrisons Point - clearly spelled out in the protocols. Despite describing it as a prison, we have seen no photographs to that effect. There are videos and pictures online of Harrisons Point and none of them resemble a prison. There have been 146 recovered people in Barbados - where are all those harrowing accounts on the ""prison"" at Harrisons Point? We do know that according to Psoe, they are receiving 3 meals per day, free wifi and round the clock attention. The original poster, Emma, was required to quarantine in the holiday accommodation that she booked, according to her, at huge expense - that is truly unfortunate, but a known possibility. I don't think either scenario can be described as inhumane, terrifying or beyond words."
"I think it's understandable that people are being required to enter an isolation facility, isn't that exactly what happened in the UK when we had our first verified cases? Under normal circumstances it sounds inhumane however these are not normal circumstances and I agree that everything I've read about here seems to be in line with the guidelines available online. Again like I mentioned above it's understanding that these situations are possible even if you are being sensible and taking your test 72hrs before your flight. On the other hand being kept in isolation by yourself in a foreign country is bound to make you feel like a sort of prisoner. I don't think Psoe has said anything about the facilities themselves to suggest that they are prison like. It sounds like there is a lot of expense going into Harrisons Point and the fact that food and wifi etc are all provided free of charge is really great. I don't think this in question nor is it the main concern. The concerning part for me is that Psoe did everything I would do, she took a test in advance (which actually came back negative when it eventually arrived) but didn't get confirmation in time and is now in a quarantine facility by herself. Jamminpete I completely agree, this was actually going to be my first trip but my boyfriend has been talking so highly of the amazing people in Barbados so my heart does go out the whole island as this is just an impossible situation."
