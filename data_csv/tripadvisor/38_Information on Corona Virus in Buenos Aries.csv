My wife and I and our 4 kids will be in Buenos Aries from March 13th-18th. What are the current updates on the cases of corona virus in Buenos Aries and the rest of Argentina?
https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/he…This is the latest I could find in English..
"Hi, As in most parts of the world, it made its way over here too. Many cases reported nationwide, few infected, and only 1 death of a senior citizen. You will not see people wearing any masks, but hand sanitizer is also nowhere to be found anymore."
I just returned from BA and it is all business as usual. Hand sanitiser available at all hotels and restaurants/cafes. There was no panic over there
"No longer business as usual. It looks like if you and your family still intend to go, you will all be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine.https://www.france24.com/en/20200311-argenti…"
Does anyone know where to get up to date info about possible quarantine of visitors from US?
I am not sure where to get official word from the Argentina government but I read the same thing on the Buenos Aires Times https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/latin-americ…
Does any one know of some that has entered argentina today or yesterday? I have flight today.
"The airports are functioning, guests are coming."
"The government is not barring entry at the airports. But according to the news articles linked above, If you arrive from one of the eight identified high-risk countries, you are subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine."
We are seeking additional information on this as well as we are set to arrive on March 19 for 9 nights. Does this mean we have to stay in our apartment the entire time and not leave? Or just avoid crowds? How will it be enforced? It does not make any sense when someone is not ill with the virus.
I read government website it doesn't say the us.. But all the news websites include it. Does anyone know why?
"This is the President's quote from the Buenos Aires Times:""This is not voluntary, it's not a recommendation. If you don't comply you'll be committing a crime, which is putting the public health at risk,"" Fernández told the FM Delta radio station. ""The person who complies with the 14-day quarantine is obliged to shut himself away at home alone.""To me, this implies that visiting tourists from the U.S. must remain in their hotel rooms or apartments. My guess is that enforcing such a quarantine would be difficult, if not impossible. Hence the President's emphasis on the criminal nature of a violation as a deterrent."
"Caesar - I am wondering the same, I have contacted the US Embassy in Argentina trying to get more details and understanding of what this means."
DDCBA Let Us know what they tell you..I have no choice but to go since my Airbnb is none refundable. I arrive tomorrow. I'll keep you posted.
"I’m from Argentina but I live in the US. I have a trip to Argentina planned for next month, please keep this thread updated with your experiences on arrival. I don’t have a clue how they would enforce tourists to self quarantine when thousands of them arrive at the airport each day? What would be the point of visiting if you are forced to do this for 14 days? Ugh."
"According to the Airbnb website, if there is a governmental decree (like quarantine), then you can get a refund. Not sure if clarification will come in time for Cesar, though. (Sorry!)I’ve seen news articles in Spanish that say 8 countries not including the US are included, and others that list 9 countries including the US. I wonder if the Argentine government has even decided yet. It seems like banning US tourists would warrant its own announcement."
"DDCBA and others: Yes, it means that you will be expected to stay in your apartment for 14 days and not leave it. Obviously this is difficult to enforce, but the government is relying on people's sense of social responsibility as well as the private enforcement of the venues themselves. As I mentioned earlier today, some milongas had started checking passport stamps before allowing you inside. Over the course of the day that has changed... now most, if not all, milongas are closing down. In other words, this is not the time for a vacation here. Even if you decide to take your chances and ignore the isolation period, public events are all being canceled. I'm sorry you think it makes no sense, DDCBA, but you have no way of knowing whether you are carrying the virus. People have been spreading it without showing symptoms themselves. Argentina cannot afford to become the next Italy, where the health-care system is on the verge of collapse because of all the patients."
"I decided to cancel my trip. I was suppose to fly out tomorrow. My Airbnb was also non-refundable, but I filled a claim after my cancellation and using the posted article above to request my money back. I will let y’all know how that goes."
"This article from today's La Nación is in Spanish, but you can easily read the list at the bottom. The U.S. is included in the high-risk countries that fall under the quarantine. https:/…"
"Yes, there is definitely conflicting information: La Nacion lists 9 countries (including the US) and the Clarin lists 8 (leaving off the US). I guess we’ll have to wait for official word from the Argentine government, but I’m not optimistic about travel from the US. I definitely don’t want to spread illness to Argentina; it’s complicated because although there are lots of cases in the US, there are zero in my community. If they want to stop tourists I hope they make it official so it’s easier for everyone to cancel flights and lodging.Edited: 6:26 pm, March 11, 2020 "
We too are planning to travel to Argentina March 19 - for 3 weeks. Found this on the US Embassy website - so far it doesn't look like the US is on it but I am sure it could change any minute. Think this would be a good site to check for updates.https://ar.usembassy.gov/covid-19/
Try this site https://ar.usembassy.gov/covid-19/
The government announced last evening they are including Us as a high risk country and subject to 14 day quarantine. You can check their Twitter account for the live announcement. AirBnB will issue a full refund with the additional documentation. Yes they have no way of controlling that people are following protocol but it’s your duty as a citizen of the world to follow instructions. You may not have symptoms and think you’re not I’ll but could easily be asymptomatic and spreading the disease everywhere. We cancelled with United and AirBnB without many issues. Will reschedule when things calm down. https://mobile.twitter.com/saludbap?lang=en
"Thank you, Jenny. Excellent advice to check their Twitter, and I applaud your sense of social responsibility. Señor Hafner, I can understand that it feels pointless to exclude people who don't have cases in their communities, but the truth is, the only reason most communities don't have cases is because there hasn't been widespread testing. As soon as they do more testing somewhere -- as you saw in Seattle and New York -- the number of cases takes off. And even in those places, a very tiny number has been tested."
"Hey, local here, the resolution is finally out. The countries are: CHINA, COREA DEL SUR, IRAN, JAPAN, USA, UK & Europehttps:/…20200312"
"I'll be flying into Argentina on Saturday. Canada is not on that list, but what has me worried if they add Canada to that list when I'm in the air before I land since being neighbours to the US and all.I'm going to try and call the Argentina Consulate today in Toronto and ask them if I'll still be ok."
Sporting events this weekend are being played behind closed doors as per government advice. Not sure if this is going to apply to all large gatherings or just sporting events.Now to try and get a refund for the Jaguares game
"Canada isn't on the list, but I'm worried if they're added lets say next week when I'm there, what would happen? Would I have to go into quarantine? If I'm flying down to El Calafate, and Canada is put on the list, will I be allowed to fly back to BA? Thanks!"
To post # 27: It's safe to assume at this point that all events that imply large gatherings of people will be cancelled. I just read for instance that all museums in Buenos Aires will close until further notice.
"Thank you. Does it say that travellers are to go into quarantine or that visas are not being issued, in other words people from the listed countries can't even get on a flight to Argentina? I am from the UK."
"Hi, I translated this from the Argentina government website. I’m also meant to be travelling 14-25.ARTICLE 1.- The application for admission as a “temporary resident” of foreigners who are abroad and are national and / or from the PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN, JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, the States of the EUROPEAN UNION and the countries that make up the Schengen area, in the subcategories established by Article 23 of Law No. 25,871 and its modifications with the following scopes: migrant worker, rentier, pensioner, investor, scientists and specialized personnel, athletes, artists, religious of officially recognized cults, academics and students. ARTICLE 2 .- Transitory suspension of the processing of applications for admission as a ""transitory resident"" of foreigners who are abroad and are national and / or from the countries mentioned in Article 1, in the subcategory “Academic” established by article 24 of Law No. 25,871 and its amendments. ARTICLE 3 °.- The processing of applications for special transitory residence of foreigners who are abroad and are national and / or from the aforementioned countries and who wish to enter the National Territory in order to carry out is suspended temporarily.

ARTICLE 7 .- This Disposition will enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Gazette. ARTICLE 8 .- Communicate, publish, give yourself to the NATIONAL ADDRESS OF THE OFFICIAL REGISTRY and file. Maria Florence Carignano"
UK Foreign Office has finally updated its website for Argentina travel. It seems to imply that no visas will be issued for UK nationals and you'll be quarantined if you do arrive:https:/…health
"Things are going on as normal though in BA? Like restaurants, bars, public transit is still operating? I know I just read major museums will be closed, but that's alright. I'll be in El Calafate and El Chalten for most of my travels anyways, so I hope the national parks are still open for hiking and stuff. Thanks"
"I will be entering Argentina through Chile by road next week. The Argentine embassy in the USA contacted me and told that all Argentine citizens returning from affected countries including USA will be asked to quarantine. They initially said as of March 11th, they are allowing foreigners to enter after signing an affidavit about countries travelled in the last 40 days and that they dont have symptoms of Coronavirus. But today they told me situation is evolving and foreigners might be asked to quarantine. They recommenced not to travel.. There seems to be some uncertainty on whether they are mandating quarantine on all foreigners or only those with visible symptoms."
Flew back to Toronto from Nashville on Feb 18th. It's been more than 21 day's/3 weeks already and I don't have any symptoms whatsoever. Would that mean they could put me into quarantine once arriving in Argentina?
"A new study suggests that COVID-19 can remain in the air for up to three hours and live on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to three days.The research, published in the medRxiv depository, also notes that the virus can remain on copper surfaces for four hours and cardboard for up to 24 hours."
As sad as it is I will most likely cancel my anniversary trip in aprilthere is no place like home ...
COVID-19 and pregnancy:https://bit.ly/2xyYfEz
"many night clubs are being closed, milongas, museums..."
"All these questions are now moot. The government has just suspended all international flights from affected countries. This is set to last for 30 days, but will surely be extended.https:/…Silvio, I know you are disappointed, but I'll say this as strongly as possible: Don't come."
p.s. ALL of Europe is now included. No flights from Europe or the U.S.
"Prathap B, the quarantine is for everybody. Many people are infected and contagious without showing symptoms. I wouldn't be surprised if you were denied entry altogether next week, since the purpose of halting flights is to keep residents of those countries out."
"Air Canada waived there no change fees if you change your flight 24 hours before your departure, so would have to do that by 10 PM tonight. I would only lose one night of a hotel I booked in El Chalten, and they even messaged me through Hotels.com that they would offer a 10% discount if I decided to rebook for a different date. My other hotels are free cancellation since they are for my later part of my trip. I haven't booked my hotel yet for the first three days in BA yet, so I'm ok there.I did book a flight with LATAM airlines that was nonrefundable down to El Calafate so would lose $400. I know I have trip cancellation on my card, but not sure if they'll give me a hard time since I booked it just this past weekend. So you would highly recommend not coming? If I did reschedule, would August or December be better?Thanks!"
"Do not come. This is not a time to be visiting. Everything is closing down -- no more cultural events, no sporting events, no tourist buses, no museums, no milongas. I expect we will soon be told to stay at home, as they're starting to recommend in Europe. I can't predict when would be best for you to reschedule, but I would choose December, which is summer. You have more chance of running into remaining health issues in August, the middle of winter. I'm pretty sure LATAM will refund your money. They know what's going on."
In BA at the moment and as people say everything is being cancelled or shut down here.Does anyone know if this is going to be rolled out across the entire country? Have been in the country for 6 weeks now so haven't brought covid in with me (unless I've caught it off someone somewhere in Argentina). Plan was to head to Iguazú falls next week but not sure if it's going to be closed too
This is a good question because most of the part of my trip was for El Chalten and el Calafate and my concern if they decide to close el parque de los glaciares
"Due to the coronavirus, Talampaya National Park in La Rioja will be closed starting March 16. The only one so far to announce closure. Of course, others might follow."
"We arrived here with an Odysseys Unlimited tour yesterday and are being sent back to the US today due to fears that all US travelers could be quarantined for 14 days. Official information from the Argentine government has been vague so out of a wealth of caution, the tour, which included 10 days in Patagonia, has been cancelled. We hope to come back when calm has been restored."
"Basketd, I'm so sorry that you got stuck in this. I can imagine how stressful this trip has been. One question: Didn't they tell your group at EZE that you had to self-quarantine right away? I'm confused by your saying that the cancellation was ""due to fear"" that the group would be told to quarantine."
"I saw yesterday on TV how American Airlines staff were announcing to passengers about to board a flight to BA that they would be requested to quarantine upon arrival and that anyone not willing to do so, was allowed to decline boarding.I thought it was perfect that passengers were warned before they flew all the way to Argentina. Now I'm wondering if this was only one exception and not the procedure for all flights, as I had assumed ..."
"every passenger from the most affected countries are writing emails about cancelling and refunds. Funny things, locals are traveling more."
"I cancelled my flight for tonight. Air Canada gave me a full travel credit which I could use and travel by Dec 31st to go anywhere. I wasn't worried about catching the virus in BA or from travelling. That wasn't my concern. More concerned about travel restrictions, quarantines, things being cancelled/closed or suspended flights. Weighed out all the options and just figured if I travel, its best to stay in the country for now. If I wasn't going to have peace of mind, wouldn't have enjoyed this trip that much. Will hope to plan a trip down to BA soon. Thanks again for all the help!"
"Wise decision, Silvio.Better to come in a few month's time, and be able to ENJOY everything that Argentina has to offer."
"The thing is the flight cost. I booked for the 4 of us for July. Round trip from Canada for $680 CAD PP. By December, the price is $2000 .. Airlines should cancel and refund rather than give Credit specially because of the unknown factor."
"When an airline sells you a ticket, they assume a lot of future risks. Gas could go up, demand could go up, weather could be bad, or a virus could break out. When you buy a ticket at a certain price, you assume a lot of risks too. Sure, you're going to take a financial hit. So are the airlines! Airlines have stockholders who are actual people too. Why should the airline have to assume all the risk and you none?"
"July is usually winter in Argentina anyways so I would imagine flights aren't as nearly as expensive as during high season. Every flight over Christmas anyways is close to $2000 if you want to fly anywhere internationally from YYZ. Might be different this year if all this fear and hysteria are still going on. If I decide not to use my travel credit by Dec 31, I could still get a partial refund where I only lose $200. If airlines refunded everyone, they would be devastated. Best thing to do is offer a travel credit and I could see them even extending it until 2021 if this outbreak gets worse.Edited: 12:02 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Just saw this article, thought it could be help for this thread:https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/wh…""Amid confusion over the government’s suspension of flights from countries “affected” by the coronavirus via a Thursday decree, officials confirmed yesterday that as from Monday aviation will be restricted within the framework of the emergency measures adopted to fight the coronavirus pandemic.Until then foreigners are free to return to their respective countries, but as from Monday flight restrictions will kick in for the next 30 days.""Not sure if that's in relation to flights from just Europe, US, Iran, China, Japan, South Korea, or all international flights in general. Also, I wonder about domestic flights.Edited: 9:29 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"@JacksonBuenosAires - Because they make Multi Billion dollar a year but I don't. They stakeholders, managers, CEOs, etc won't be affected. The normal employees of the airlines will lose their job. They already started laying people off. So don't worry about airlines. They will make couple hundred million dollars less ... i on the other hand, don't make enough to afford a $2K ticket per person."
To the one worried about airlines not refunding. Here is how they are going to save! Slashing half of their employees. https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51847882
"""They stakeholders, managers, CEOs, etc won't be affected."" Umm the shareholders are the owners of the company and are also stakeholders. That is sort of basic."
"I called LATAM airlines tonight, was waiting for about 50-60 mins so not to bad considering some of the other horror stories I've heard. If I no-show for my flight, I'll be able to rebook another domestic flight in Argentina until Dec 31st and pay the difference in fare if any. So they are also offering future travel credits as well and no charge to rebook for a later date. Will only lose one night of a hotel in El Chalten, but will be refunded for the other two nights at least. Will give Hotels.com a call or the hotel a call tomorrow and see what my options are. Otherwise I'll just be down $180, so not that bad. Anyways, thank you everyone for all the advice and suggestions over the last couple of days.I really appreciate it. I hope everyone stays safe in Argentina and hope to visit in December."
"Thanks for everyones input on this. My partner and I are booked to travel to BA on Easter weekend from Aus. Then travel to Brazil for 2 weeks, then fly Rio to BA, then back to Aus.If Argentina keeps its boarders open to passengers from from Australia, without having to quarantine, we will still be coming. If they close thier boarders, we will have no choice but to cancel."
Travelers are turning to these threads for urgent information now. Please don't make them have to wade through this nonsense. Save the trolling for elsewhere.
Borders close for 2weeksjust read about it
Hi everyone. My wife and I are currently in BA and we've been here since 8 March. We were in Puerto Iguazu on 7 March and came in by bus from Foz do Iguacu. We've got a flight to Trelew booked tomorrow. And onward bus travel to Puerto Montt in Chile before we travel across Patagonia (through both Argentina and Chile). At least that's what we've planned. We're both from Malaysia and have not been in a high risk area since 18 February. We were in USA between 6-17 February though.We're having trouble figuring out if we would be allowed to re-enter Argentina from Chile later next month?We've been following the news but some details still seem unclear. Our Spanish is poor and BA Times doesn't seem to have the latest news. I've read some places that say no travel IN and OUT of the country for 30 days and other that say this only applies to people traveling from/to high risk areas. Would appreciate any help or suggestions on where to follow the latest developments.
right now Argentina is closing it's borders for 2 weeks starting midnight. You will not be able to re-enter the country if you intend to in that period. I'd just stay on the argentine side and wait for things to clear up a bit for everyone. Crazy times. Be safe
Thanks Mark. Yea I think that's what we'll be doing.
"If you cross into Chile you will then need to stay in Chile. Which is maybe a better place as the Chilean president is a moderate liberal, not a nationalist, and is not paranoid about the coronavirus."
At the time we left the quarantine information was unclear. After we left I received an email from the US Embassy in Buenos Aires that US travelers who had arrived in Argentina in the last 14 days would be quarantined for 14 days by the Argentine government.
"@ post # 68: Pierre, I don't know how much Chile's president polítical inclinations have to do on health issues, but Chile has now closed its borders to all non resident foreigners."
"Hi, does anyone know if it is still possible to transit through to another international flight? My route home to New Zealand is from Santiago -> BA -> Auckland, with a 3 hour stopover, not leaving airside. I'm struggling to find details on the border closure."
"Will those flights really operate ? Or be cancelled ? That's the real question. Otherwise, yes, I think you can."
"Hi, we’re in the same situation. Currently in Argentina but due to fly home to NZ from Santiago. Since Chile has closed its borders we will have to cancel that flight and re-book from Mendoza via BA"
"The Argentine Government has just announced that all the domestic flights and long distance services of buses and trains will be suspended from Friday, March 20 to Wednesday, March 25 in order to avoid people traveling around the country for the long holiday weekend.Furthermore, see the information below that was posted yesterday by the American Citizen Services in Buenos Aires but may be useful for all travelers:Multiple countries in the region are implementing travel restrictions with little advance notice. We are currently aware of the following restrictions:• Panama has confirmed its borders will close for entry to non-residents effective tonight at 11:59pm; U.S. citizens intending to transit Panama should contact their air carrier to confirm they can still do so.• Peru has confirmed its will close borders tonight, March 16 at 11:59pm.• Chile has confirmed its borders will close to foreigners on March 18.Further border closings in the region are expected. Passengers should endeavor to travel on the remaining direct flights to the U.S. whenever possible. Passengers with an itinerary including a stopover should contact their air carrier for more information. Aerolineas Argentinas will also be operating limited flights to the U.S. after Tuesday, March 17; citizens who have exhausted other flight options should contact Aerolineas Argentinas for more information on booking those flights.Edited: 1:45 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"I just spoke to a friend who is still in BA. Life is pretty much live everywhere else. Strict lockdown has shown good results so far. Be safe everyoneEdited: 10:27 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"Those of us who live here -- me, Verobaires, and Alewal, among the regular contributors -- can tell you whatever you want to know about the quarantine. It happened much earlier than in the U.S. hotspots and it is stricter. Unlike in NY, we aren't allowed to take walks or to exercise outdoors. We can only shop in markets close to our apartments. We're all praying that these measures will maintain a flatter curve.Unfortunately, there was a giant setback in the past couple of days, as banks opened for retirees to get their pension money and elderly people crowded into long lines, many even sleeping overnight on the sidewalks in various cities. We won't see the fallout from that for a few weeks."
that's terrible to hear. It's a very difficult situation everywhere. Here in Denver we are still allowed to exercise outside but some other states won't allow it. Crazy days
"Looks like it will be extended with much more restrictions, on Apr 13."
Argentina extends lockdown in Buenos Aires and the metropolitan areahttps://bit.ly/2WgbXWA
Argentina has more cases of dengue fever than coronavirus:https://bit.ly/2WDEEMc
"We are on an extended quarantine until May 24th, and as MonteCD promptly said, we have more Dengue cases (a real surge compared to previous years) than COVID-19 so far.The last three days, an increasing number of cases have been detected on less favourable neighbourhoods (around 100 cases daily) and those areas represent a cluster, unlike the rest of the city."
jorge c: Does your second paragraph refer to COVID-19 cases or Dengue cases?
"Monte, it refers to COVID-19 cases. The surge comes from ""Villas"" and more humble ""barrios"" of Buenos Aires city, where social distancing and sanitation is surely a problem."
"On the other hand, Dengue cases have sprawled all over the city, interestingly, in traditional and more up-end neighbourhoods as well."
"LATAM Argentina announced today that there is not going to do any domestic, regional or international flight departing from Argentina, as part of the government restrictions.The local airline industry was trying to reverse the meausre in order to have a basic skeleton of internal flights at least, before Sep 1st (the end date of the restriction) but it seems LATAM will not push further.It is yet to be seen what will happen with Flybondi, JetSmart and Andes."
To keep this thread current... the quarantine has been extended through June 7.
"Thanks for the update, Sylvie2! Cheers!"
"And the new quarantine extension goes thru June 28th, though with some new easings (mainly adult walks and running, children out both days on Weekend, clothing and apparel stores re-openings, etc)."
"Thanks for posting, Jorge. It felt jarring (to me) yesterday to see all the doors open to the San Telmo Mercado and the restaurants and small shops preparing to re-open. A lot more people around, maybe half with masks hanging below their chins, nobody distancing."
"Sylvie, that's a bit scary given the situation. In my neighbourhood, most people behave properly. There are always some ""special"" ones that do not respect what is now the new norm. Hopefully the curve of new cases will stay flat for the next days, but we will see. Stay safe and healthy!"
"Thanks, Jorge... you too! People in San Telmo have been great over the past three months, very careful and respectful. That's why it felt so strange yesterday. I guess being given the ok to start re-opening was interpreted as an ok to relax their vigilance."
"You are right about that, it also shows that people are getting honestly and understandably really tired of the restrictions and stay-at-home orders.After all it has been a long time, enough for the medical system to get ready for the peak. The sad part is to understand that Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires are still a long way to go in order for the new relaxation to take place, in my opinion."
"The city of Buenos Aires surpassed 10000 cases yesterday, a sad milestone."
"Jorge, that is a terrible milestone. I hope that the cases were spread out enough for the hospitals to deal with so many cases. Best wishes to everyone in Buenos Aires."
"That is a terrible milestone for a single city. Here in the UK we passed 40k deaths yesterday but thankfully we are seeing the rate of new infections declining substantially, the death rate is slowing too albeit not by the same degree. Hopefully we are over the worst and I hope you guys will start to see the same decline.The government here has begun to ease the lockdown. Sadly, many have taken this to mean it no longer exists and are behaving as though there is no longer a problem. To an extent it is unsurprising, as our political ""leaders"" have been sending out some very confusing messages which the media ( both social and traditional) are confusing even further. I guess people just hear want they want to hear. IMHO , it was way too soon for us to ease lockdown restrictions and we are further along the progression curve Than you guys.The problem is been exacerbated with the anti racism protests over the last week which have seen thousands converging in central London, ignoring social distancing, not wearing masks. Pretty horrifying and I can see second waves of the infection looming!Stay safe and thank you for posting on the current situation there. Our thoughts are with all our friends in Argentina."
"The beginning relaxation of lockdown restrictions in BsAs seem reasonable (they have been very strict) provided that gathering crowds maintain the need for some distancing and for masks. And for hand sanitation. The statistics for Argentina continue to be of serious concern - to Argentines and to those of us, from afar, who love the country and it's people.Stay Safe & Stay Well."
"It's indeed a problem. however the health and sanitarian system seem to be ready and capable to deal with much worse scenario (let's hope we don't get to that point). The city of Buenos Aires has about 3 million inhabitants, but has many ""villa miserias"" spread inside the city (poor neighbourhoods with terrible sanitarian conditions).Every single neighbourhood in the city has Corona cases and some are seeing a hike in new cases (not necessarily the worse ""barrios"" only).Today is the 80th day of a stricter lockdown that is going to be eased to some new activities come Monday.We will see how it goes from here.Thanks everyone for their nice wishes!"
"Let's hope that in BsAS, and in The USA, the need for more equitable and sane sanitation and services for poor and ill serviced barrios is addressed as a long term benefit of this horrific public health nightmare."
"Marnie, one can only hope but I don't see any changes coming up soon in that matter. I wish I'm proven wrong!"
