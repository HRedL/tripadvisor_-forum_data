HiI am going to Cancun in the end of March. I am not sure what is the situation in Cancun now. Thank you.
"the topic has been discussed extensively. Just search the forum, you will find the information"
That’s an entire month away. Conditions will change rapidly within that time frame. Just buy travel health insurance and go enjoy your vacation. You can find fear mongers on here or read until you find a post you want to hear and agree with.
"There are zero cases in the Mexican Caribbean. there are zero travel advisories or warnings recommending against travel to our region by any foreign government like the U.S. State Department. Furthermore, the CDC gives Mexico and the Caribbean a “Green” or “Level 1” ranking – which means they do not recommend canceling or postponing travel to our region because the risk of COVID-19 is thought to be low. There is no reason for you to change your travel plans. Mexico’s Caribbean destinations remain among of the safest and most enjoyable places in the world to visit right now."
"partygirl40, your message is stated like a true ostrich."
"We can listen to the doomers here and assume that this is the second coming of the Spanish flu and we will all die.Or be reasonable and take extraordinary measures to protect the vulnerable elderly and for the rest of us, go to enhanced hand washing, use of hand sanitizers and no contact with your germ ridden hand.Edited: 9:35 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I would also like to know this.
"We just returned from Cancun last night. It’s safe. There are cases in Mexico, however currently trouble free in Cancun. We took the “red bus” to the Plaza Forum, walked around, ate, etc. We took the ferry over to Isla Mujeres and no issues. We were more worried about returning through Atlanta and coming home. Atlanta, first time we ever went right through customs and immigration, they were literally just rushing people through. I’d say we were through in under 15 minutes. That’s unheard of in Atlanta. Anyway, no worries in Cancun, we did use wipes and hand sanitizer, always be safe, don’t get lackadaisical. Also I always get a prescription for Cipro before traveling to another country. It fights off bacteria, won’t get Montezuma’s revenge as they say. You’ll be fine. Have a good time."
"PS: I did buy travel medical insurance through Seven Corners, 1mil each on medical and medical evacuation included for $59 and some change."
"In today's Riviera Maya News:Ministry of Health says claim of coronavirus in Cancun is falseBY RIVIERA MAYA NEWS ON MARCH 13, 2020Cancun, Q.R. — The Ministry of Health says a letter circulating across social media claiming a positive case of coronavirus in Cancun is false.The head of SESA (Secretaría de Salud Quintana Roo) responded to the circulation of the letter, referring to it as fake news, reminding the population to better inform themselves through official means of state health authorities.The announcement came from SESA head Alejandra Aguirre Crespo, who posted the reaction on social media, confirming that the official data of Covid-19 in Quintana Roo still stands at zero confirmed cases.She explained that from February 28 to 7:00 p.m. Thursday, March 12 there have been a total of 17 suspected cases, 12 negative and five under study.She says a false letter on SESA letterhead that appears signed by state the governor claiming a positive case of coronavirus in Cancun is completely false, calling it an apocryphal document.“Until now, no case in Quintana Roo. In all the suspected cases the corresponding protocols were applied,” said Alejandra Aguirre.State Governor Carlos Joaquín González also confirmed that Quintana Roo remains free of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus), saying that the state maintains international protocol. The governor highlighted the importance of having reliable information, noting that Quintana Roo is prepared for any contingency.He stressed that there are no flight cancellations to Quintana Roo, specifically to Cancun, adding that there is also no notice of future cancellations."
"The Secretary of Health, Mauricio Sauri Vivas, confirmed this afternoon the first case of Covid-19 coronavirus in Yucatan. March 13 According to what was said at a press conference in the Government Palace, it is a 57-year-old female patient."
To the OP - as I see you are Canadian be advised the the government has now urged Canadians to get back home from ALL international destinations.https:/…trudeau-covid-19-1.5496367Soon there may only 2 or 3 airports even allowing flights in from other countries. And soon after that a border shutdown. I doubt you will even be able to leave at end of March.
There are two confirmed cases in the Yucatan Peninsula.One is in Merida and the other is in Benito Juarez. That is the municipality that Cancun is in. This confirmed case was detected at the Hospital General here in Cancun.
"Listen to your government:https:/…221Also note the 14 day self isolation mentioned in the above link when you come back if you ever ignore this sound advice ( https:/…covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html )Edited: 7:28 pm, March 14, 2020 "
The Canadian Government is advising all Canadians to return home because of the outbreak of the covid 19 which I think we all should take heed for our own good and show consideration for the elderly. Those that will not heed the warning should not expect the Canadian Government to go and rescue them if they get stuck outside of Canada. The government is advising the Canadians of airlines cancelling flights without much warning .We love going Cancun but right now it can wait for another day. Keep well everyone.
They say there is 41 cases now. We r suppose to leave mon
"What's your source for that statement?Can you provide a link to the place you read that, please? Thanks!"
@ 17 do you mean this? https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-tr…or this?https://politica.expansion.mx/presidencia/20…
"One source says 41 cases - but I would wait until we get better sources/confirmationBut for Canada, yes, most are cancelling all international travel based on the Govt recommendations"
"@ 19: it's easy to google: all news sites report it. What more official source do you ask for than this one? https:/… (surely you can find google translate if you can't read it)Edited: 12:52 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Thanks for the links.I totally believe we as a country are up to 41 cases.Honestly, when I first read the statement I thought she was referring to their being 41 cases here in Cancun. Not that I don't think that's possible because I do. It just didn't mix with what I'm hearing here.Thanks again for the links."

"We just returned and everything was fine. However, terminals 3 and 4 are flooded with passengers from highly impacted countries including the USA. The risk get higher as the time goes by. We were extremely diligent with cleaning the seats, tray tables, handles, etc. The risk is not in Cancun per say- the real risk is at the airports and during the flight. I suggest that you reschedule your trip for a later date."
Cancun should be safer than many areas right now I would continue to be aware use wipes and hand sanitizer and wash hands often and be careful but also not let fear that media spreads drive your decision you should be aware at the airport.
"I have a trip to cancun scheduled on Thursday and still not sure if we should go regarding to the CoVid situation. Besides hygiene and not being sick, I'm wondering if things are working normally like restaurants, cenotes, parks and stuff. Are they thinking about closing entertainment?"
"Coming in two weeks to Tulum, not worried about anything! Flying private, plenty of ice cold Corona's waiting."
Did you cancel or on your way?
What have you decided to do? We are suppose to leave for Isla Mujeres next Tuesday.
I’m canceling my trip.
Click on the header of this page Covid-19 map shows that Mexico currently has 82 cases. Refresh and it gives you up to date cases. When I booked my trip there were 4 cases on Mar 4. Was to leave Mar 22 my flight was cancelled. Two airlines in Canada are no longer flight south. They are sending empty planes to pick up travellers to return to Canada.
"We were going to Cancun this Saturday for one week and canceled the trip this morning. The whole idea of going on vacation is not to be stressing about any new measures being implemented every day, risking our ability to return home safely. We got full refunds from Delta and Raintree."
"Hi Joan S. I am still planning travel for this Thursday March 19. Has there been a decrease in tourists from countries with increased covid 19 cases? My family and I are traveling from the US. We have traveled many times to Cancun, and there was always a great amount of cultural diversity there. Any changes in tourism you have seen recently with the travel bans from other countries?"
"I was supposed to leave this Thursday from Brazil to tulum. I've been planning since september. But denifinitely need to cancel at this point, there is no point going there to worry :("

I've read many many posts on here from people who have or are going to cancel. And things are changing here too. 2 resorts have decided to close and chances are others will follow. People are asked to avoid large gatherings. That will have to have an impact on tourism. I wouldn't travel here or anywhere right now. I just can't imagine it would be any fun."
"Help, Even to reschedule, X-caret hotel wants an official US document restricting our travel. We were to leave Friday March 20, Were can I find help? We paid in full and it has been charged to credit card already."
"Wow, it doesn't sound like Hotel Xcaret isn't being helpful at all. Do you have trip insurance?Edited: 4:39 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Joan S. Thanks for the reply! I just called our resort within the past hour and they said they have no intention on closing. Do you have the names of the resorts? I tried to call the parent company of the resort we will be staying and haven't gotten through.
Are you able to tell me what resorts have closed?
"My understanding is that it's Beloved and Club Med.And they haven't closed yet. Apparently they're scheduled to close Friday.Edited: 8:05 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Thank you for posting today. My family and I are supposed to go to Cancun this Sunday, March 22nd and are wondering whether we should cancel our trip or not. We really want to go, but many family members are discouraging us from going. We are staying at the Grand Mayan at Vidanta Riviera Maya (closer to playa del Carmen). Any idea if it is closing? We want to go see the pyramids, snorkeling, etc.. but with everything going on we don't know if those things will be closed. Are restaurants closing? Please reply when you get a chance. Thanks so much!"
"I do not know, and no one here knows, when the resorts will be closing, but I think in 2-3 weeks they’ll be closed for 1-3 months. If you want to vacation in a lively atmosphere, this is not it. But the staff is so grateful for the patrons and you will be treated like Kings and Queens! The restaurants are not restricted but they are slow and/or on rotating closures because there aren’t as many people to accommodate. There is plenty of food, and so much kindness and care here. I would worry about having a place to stay, but I would purchase travel insurance. Again, just curious about travel back, everything keeps changing. But Mexico is not planning on travel restricted as of yet. Also confirmed on the US travel advisory website. I’m also signed up for STEP, and haven’t received anything in my inbox regarding changes in travel. Come on down! The waters fine :)"
"These answers provide no help.Edited: 3:48 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Sorry --I meant to reply to a particular post that was not helpful. I do appreciate the good ones. Thanks
"Thanks so much for your reply Richelle M. We are still debating whether to cancel or not. I just called the resort we're supposed to stay at and they said they are not closing. It is cold and rainy here (San Diego) right now so I would much rather be there which is in the 80's, but I am still debating.Hopefully if we go everything we want to see and do will still be available."
"You would be wise to cancel, it's a distinct possibility that the border will be shut, and even if you can come back, you'll likely be quarantined."
Do not go!
"Hnsause It says that you are from playa del Carmen, Is that correct? If so, can you please be more specific on why you said we should not go?"
"If your plans include hitting the club's and bars while you're then I'd rethink coming. Effective March 22 all bars, clubs and casinos in the State are ordered closed.https:/…Edited: 6:53 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Joan S. Thank you for the information. We do not plan on going to bars and clubs. My family and I wanted to see the beaches, go see the pyramids & the ruins, etc... But it sounds like those activities are possibly closing also. Can anyone confirm?Thanks for your help!"
"Lala, read all the other threads regarding this issue. After spending time reading, I hope you can answer your own question....do not go and possibly spread virus there or when you get back. You have been advised by your government not to travel unless necessary! Yes, it’s horrible to lose a lot of money. Many of us are in the same boat."
Go enjoy your vacation and leave everybody else to worry what the fake news is spitting out everyday!!!
"I know that Chichen Itza is going to close, it's part of a story closing all schools in the Yucatan. For anyone who was thinking Mexico was immune, think again. https:/…"
We lost money. Suppose to left today but refuse to risk infection or infecting others.
"Thank you all for your replies. My family and I will most likely postpone our vacation. :( We would rather be safe, than sorry."
"""I know that Chichen Itza is going to close, it's part of a story closing all schools in the Yucatan. For anyone who was thinking Mexico was immune, think again. https:/…""Thanks for sharing! I still plan on going on Monday for now."
"I think it would be wise to stay home. As of March 16, 2020, there were four cases of coronavirus reported in Quintana Roo. Some of those infected came to Mexico from Spain, according to Milenio.com. We were to go on Tuesday and backed out the day before. Tough decision, but so glad we stayed home. Keep yourself and others safe. :) Also, watching some youtube vidoes of doctors in Italy who are on the front lines treating patients describing what is headed for the US helped me make the decision."
"Cancun mayor orders all bars, theaters, casinos closedBY RIVIERA MAYA NEWS ON MARCH 19, 2020Cancun, Q.R. — Cancun’s mayor María Lezama Espinosa announced that her administration has ordered the closing of cinemas, bars, discos and casinos effective immediately, as part of the measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.The move was made with officials saying the advance of the pandemic requires taking stricter measures, understanding that people’s health and life take precedence over economic value.Lezama Espinosa announced that supermarkets, pharmacies and hospitals will be asked to establish meter-and-a-half distances between their clients. She says city hall meetings will be held behind closed doors and will broadcast news on both the Internet and by radio.She added that as of Thursday, in-person tax payments will be suspended without any consequence to the tax payer, noting that it is vital to prevent the spread of the virus, for which it is necessary to respect the provisions of the federal, state and municipal governments.“We cannot allow the virus to spread, we must put up barriers, which is why we are working with all sectors, hoteliers, restaurateurs, shopping malls, street vendors. We have to act based on a strategy and in an orderly manner,” she explained.“Everyone agrees we need to take whatever actions need to be taken. You have to establish social isolation and there are businesses that will have to close,” she added. “It is not about creating panic, but it is a global pandemic…and we are living it. The most important thing is health, hence preventive measures must be applied.”In light of the announcement by Cancun’s mayor, the Ministry of Health clarified that a letter circulating across social media claiming the restrictions apply to the state is completely false.The agency says that the letter, which is allegedly from Cofepris announcing the closure of bars, nightclubs and casinos throughout the state, is apocryphal. The fake news has been spread across WhatsApp and Facebook.As of today, these new restrictions apply only to the municipality of Benito Juárez."
whats your decision? we are going 3/27 from LA. should we go tho?
"Dear TA I just can’t live without my vacation. I don’t care that my government banned non-essential travel, that people are dying, that I could spread the virus, or that the economy is collapsing. I need a tan! Will you all contribute to my Gofundme when I am crying about being stuck in QR while everything is shut down? And read my posts about how I deserve a travel refund? Thanks! Luv clueless. ps remember to click ‘helpful’ on my negative Yelp reviews"
"We were there March 7-15, and if I had it to do over again I would not go. Before we left, we thought things were fine. By the end of the week the US had declared a state of emergency, and we were worried about not even being allowed back into the country. We had groups of tourists at our resort from countries which are now under lockdown, and going through an international airport is incredibly stressful right now. I love vacations and I love Mexico, but I would postpone any travel right now."
Resorts Closinghttps:/…360044592594-Closures-Due-to-COVID-19
"According to multiple sources, the US State Department is about to issue a level 4 travel advisory for all international travel. US citizens will have to return home immediately or remain in place. All non essential travel will be suspended."
"Politico news....US to issue level 4 travel warninghttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/cor…Edited: 12:38 pm, March 19, 2020 "
US just announce level 4 Travel advisory. This advisory is not a ban on travel however it does state with very strong verbiage that if you don’t return to the United States Soon you may be forced to shelter in place where you are now and the US will not get you out if you choose to stay
"""US just announce level 4 Travel advisory.

Jordanbulls the reason Soutwest is listing those dates as the Cayman Islands and the Dominican Republic have temporarily banned flights from the US for late March through April due to a small number of coronavirus cases seen in their country. The Cayman's for example had 1 case that traveled from Europe.
It’s on the site: Level 4https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…
""" the reason Soutwest is listing those dates as the Cayman Islands and the Dominican Republic have temporarily banned flights from the US for late March through April due to a small number of coronavirus cases seen in their country.""So it means they will continue to travel to Cancun no matter what?"
"""So it means they will continue to travel to Cancun no matter what?"" It really shouldn't matter one way or another. You shouldn't be coming here right now. Resorts are closing. No bars or clubs open. No movie theatres. I had to go to 3 stores today to get what I needed and still couldn't get all that was on my list. And the US government is saying don't travel internationally and get home now if you're out of the country.So really? Does it matter if Southwest continues to fly here?"
I just got back from Isla Mujeres and Cancun after being gone a week. Seems like they were starting some precautions in airports on the way back but everything was business as usual everywhere else.
"Things have changed in just 24 hours. It's not business as usual anymore. No bars.No clubs.No casinos.No movie theatresResorts closing.And who knows what tomorrow may bring. You left just before things started closing. Good timing on your part, lol.Edited: 10:19 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Business as usual-?- what a shame!
"To the Castle Rock CO poster who is happy they went and exposed EVERYONE to a deadly virus. Why? I guess I'm learning, but, I do NOT get the level of selfishn ess that leads people to think it's cool to expose other to this virus. It is ALL over CO, and it is ALL over the airports. WTH would you go?? To save 2K?? Human lives are worth that to you? 2K savings? We live in Castle Rock, and we bought a home in Cozumel. WE are staying in Castle Rock until it is absolutely safe for us to be there, in our home, for the people there. MIGHT be another 12 to 18 months. Hope you are NOT in our subdivision. Enjoy your vacay."

Such entitlement...and ya think an ice cold Corona will protect you? What if you've been exposed and take it on your private plane to Mexico? Geez. Stay home already.
Looks like trump will invoke the Defense production act in the conference scheduled for the next few moments. Restrictions on the border expected as well.
"Trump and CV conference on right now. federal interest on student loans waived, moved tax filing from April 15th to July 15th. No interest or penalties. Mentioned borders..waiting..."
"CV conference more: Pompeo going to make statement about Mexican border..waiting for it. Trump says he’s working closely with Mexico and Canada, mentions concerns regarding cross border movements. Now going a bit off about southern border and agents.. calls it a possible perfect storm if border left unchecked."
Mexico is border closed on land and Pompeo making it clear that if you choose not to return to US you may very well be on your own and be prepared to stay where you are. Now Wolf I’m talking more about travel.
DHS head now talking about cross border travel. Limiting non essential travel across Mexico US border. Legal shipments and commerce still allowed. Now talking about individuals. No one can come across individually without proper credentials. Those trying to come across border illegally will be arrested and returned to their countries of origin immediately
Southwest Airlines just announced last flights from US in and out of Cancun are scheduled for March 22. If you are on Southwest with departure after this date you better give them a call.
"Think you'll find there are 183 covid19 cases in Mexico wit six in Cancun, at the time of writing & rising daily !!"
Has delta made any similar notices? I cant find anything.
The only thing I've seen about Delta is they are reducing their flights by 80%. But I haven't seen anything specific as to what flights.
"""Think you'll find there are 183 covid19 cases in Mexico wit six in Cancun, at the time of writing & rising daily""MisterB just posted the municipality of Benito Juarez (where Cancun is) is up to 10 cases.I don't recall the total number for the state."

"""Has delta made any similar notices? I cant find anything.""All of United, American and Delta have been cancelling flights like crazy. United cancelled 3 of our flights. Basically because they had to cancel the original flight as they only had like 6-10 people on them. Our flight to Cancun only had 7 people but because the return flight was full they went."
Be careful some insurance companies are NOT providing insurance during the pandemic
Check with your insurance company 1st. they may no give you insurance at this time
"Unfortunately, travel insurance does not cover pandemics. We purchased our trip and insurance last June...long before COVID 19...and we are not covered.At this point (we were going to Costa Rica 4/24) we are waiting for flights to cancel...until then we are out of luck. Strangely, although we have no flight TO Costa Rica with Delta anymore....we still have a flight home!!"
"Secretary of Tourism says NO NO COVID Free certification for Cancun Hotel ZoneBY RIVIERA MAYA NEWS ON APRIL 30, 2020Cancun, Q.R. — The secretary of tourism says there will NOT be any COVID Free certification for the Cancun Hotel Zone since it is not possible to guarantee tourists do not become infected.The Director of the hotel association wants to obtain a covid free certification, the only way the can obtain this is by paying the officials off.Marisol Vanegas Péreez, Secretaria de Turismo Quintana Roo, made the clarification during a virtual tourism meeting explaining that the proposal for an international certification “is a very large commitment that CAN NOT be fulfilled as it CAN NOT be guaranteed that a tourist would not get sick.”Vanegas Péreez announced her clarification after the head of AMPI Cancun real estate association, Miguel Ángel Lemus Mateos, said that once the coronavirus epidemic ends, the Cancun Hotel Zone will be certified as COVID Free. nOT TRUE UNLESS YOU PAY SOMEONE OFF.THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION, ONE CAN NOT HAVE PEOPLE TRAVELLING TO OTHER DESTINATIONS UNLESS THEIR DESTINATIONS ARE COVID FREE.
