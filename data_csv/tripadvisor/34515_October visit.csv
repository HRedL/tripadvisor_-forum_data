"I am due to visit Chicago for 4 days in early October. I am wondering about the likelihood of Hotels, Restaurants and places of Entertainment being open. I am interested in and will be grateful for any considered opinions from local people"
"We don’t know. Will you, as a Foreign National, be allowed in the US? Chicago is trying a “soft opening” and if it goes wrong a new shutdown will occur later this summer.Get back to us in late September.Edited: 2:53 pm, May 06, 2020 "
We'd like to know too.
Have you checked hotel availability and rates for your proposed dates? Book something that’s fully cancelable without penalty. What’s the refund policy for your airline ticket?
Interesting... Thanks. Here’s hoping.... Stay safe everybody
"Some hotels have remained open. Restaurants are only open for carry-out and delivery at present, no bars are open or entertainment venues.Our State Governor has formulated a 5-phase plan for reopening the State of Illinois. We are in Phase 2 now. Phase 3 cannot begin before the end of May and implementation will depend on such things as a steady decline in the number of new cases, the availability of hospital beds in case of a resurgence, etc. Phase 4 is what we all really want to see, 'cuz that's when restaurants and other venues will reopen, even tho there will be capacity limits.As others have said, it's far too soon to tell what October will be like."
You're taking a cruise? No. Please do not come to Chicago.
"You have a lot of due diligence to do. Carnival Cruise Lines owns Cunard and they have announced that they will not sail until after August 19. https://www.carnivalcorp.com/news-releases/n… You booked a hotel in Chicago in 2019. This is 2020 and the situation has changed drastically. The latest data that I can find is that the UK has 17.7 deaths per 100,000 population; The US has 7.19 deaths per 100,000 population. There is a ban on entry into the US from Europe. If you take the QMII, will you, as a Foreign National, be able to disembark in the US? Last years plans have been superseded by this year's reality. Please do not come to Chicago.Edited: 5:07 pm, May 06, 2020 "
I don’t think you’ll be allowed into the USA. Right now foreign citizens who have been in Europe including the UK within the past 14 days cannot enter the USA. https:/…from-other-countries.htmlOur current president is blaming people for bringing a “foreign” virus to the USA. I don’t think he’s going to relax travel restrictions just a couple months before the election in November.
"Tough to say, I'd assume they would be, but who knows at this point!"
"I appreciate your thoughts, you know we have similar restrictions, we use quarantine for returning Nationalsbut will probably relax some restrictions before October"
"It is , might know more nearer the time"
"Ever?..... Don’t come to Chicago Ever?? Since I retired I have been coming to the USA for several years as I like American People and love your Country. The Queen Mary docks in Brooklyn similar to a plane arriving from the UK at a New York airport, it’s basically a shuttle to get across the Atlantic.Only healthy travellers will be allowed on planes or ships when they resume service,If sailing the Queen Mary a Cunard Ship, (an American company) will have docked in Southampton UK with very welcome American tourists.I understand your concern but would you believe me if I told you I would not travel anywhere unless I was confirmed free of Coronavirus ?But thanks for your reply... such as it was"
"Thank you indeed for taking the time to Explain this too me, I have now got a clear idea of your situation and plans......we only tend to get Eurocentric reporting in the UK. So this Forum has yet again been so useful to me"
You know I use this Forum on a regular basis and I see you do...... Have you ever posted a question and got a completely unhelpful and some what condescending reply? .... I have ...... but thankfully only occasionally
"I, for one, hope and expect to see tourism back when we reach Phase 4 in Chicago. The stories on U.S. media about the COVID-19 cases aboard various Princess Cruise Line and Holland America Line ships and the travails of the passengers were truly appalling. The Cunard Line, despite being under the Carnival corporate umbrella, appears to have been spared. I have friends who cross the Atlantic aboard the Queen from time to time and love it.While this is a bit off-topic, I have a reservation aboard a Lindblad ship (148 passengers) departing from Alaska in September. Assuming ships will even be allowed to sail out of U.S. ports by then, I am debating whether to go or cancel. No Lindblad ship had a COVID-19 case so far and they have very strict protocols in place, yet passengers will be from all over and, in my mind, mingling with other passengers (unavoidable at meals and daily excursions) is where the risk lies. Food for thought."
"Unless the cruise doesn't cancel.... and you are forced to go or lose a lot of money.  I don't think a cruise anytime soon is a good idea. There is no way that they can only allow healthy people on board. Even if they test everyone before boarding (which seems logistically impossible) The incubation time when the virus is undetectable is too long. It only takes 1 person. While total new cases remain high like they are in the UK and US I would stay off of cruise ships.B.Edited: 9:52 am, May 07, 2020 "
"Yes, Booya, that's it in a nutshell. Tho, w/ 148 passengers, it's not logistically difficult to take temperatures and quiz people about their travels. Even that isn't sufficient protection, tho, as you point out. That's what I'm reflecting on. Jiak, Lindblad has a very liberal cancellation policy at this time and is allowing passengers to rebook on another 2020 or2021 cruise, but still and all, we're not getting any younger and not too many more opportunities are left for an adventure voyage. It's a calculated risk and each of us has to decide what risk/reward ratio we're willing to accept."
"CV - You have a lot to think about. Obviously the small number of people makes things safer. For me personally I don't think I would worry too much about actually getting the virus, I would worry. more about getting stuck on the ship for an extend period of time like the Princess cruises. That's what keeps me off a boat.Again yours being so small the risk of this happening is equally as small.B."
Until there's a vaccine we really shouldn't be allowing cruise ships to dock here. I'd consider them very high risk. And the chance of getting stuck on the ship is not one I'd be willing to take. There are still 50k employees stuck on the ships.
CDC recommends that travelers defer all cruise travel worldwide.https:/…coronavirus-cruise-ship
"Jaik2781, I’m surprised at your reactions in your posts 12-16. Perhaps it is a difference in British English and American English.12. You note that you (the UK I assume) have a 14 day quarantine for returning Nationals. But you are Not a returning national in the USA; you are a Foreign National. As of this time, you will not be allowed into this country. As Wes mentioned in #10, our current president will stick to his mandate against foreign nationals, just to prove is own point, before elections Nov. 3.13. You’re guessing. According to the scientists it will be 18 months to 2 years before a vaccine may be developed and ready for distribution. Human Immunodeficiency Virus is 50 years old and there is still no vaccine.14. No one said that you shouldn’t come to Chicago ever. We’re talking in the here and now and answering according to the dates you’ve given. It would be wonderful if all you had to worry about is if you are Covid-19 free. The Queen Mary 2 carries a passenger population of 2600 and a crew of 1250. You need to worry that 3800 other people are virus free.15. We’re glad to be of service16. Thankfully none of the answers you received on this post have been condescending or unhelpful. (Refer back to #15). I read that our answers are correct and to the point. Perhaps you don't like what we're telling you. It’s a terrible thing to have an anticipated holiday and such luxurious travel taken away by an International Pandemic but that is the reality of 2020. As Booyakasha said, we all enjoy a nice cruise. We were planning a 90 day Pacific Rim vacation on Crystal Cruises. That’s not happening now.As we have learned from the Diamond Princess, Artania, Westerdam, Grand Princess, Ruby Princess, Costa Atlantica and the World Dream ships, ships are incubators for a virus. Comment #22. The best of luck to you. It’s a shame that you nor we have a crystal ball to look ahead to October."
Haven’t posted in a while. Chicago like most large cities has been hit very hard by this virus. Even if you did come in Oct would museums be open? Restaurants? Etc. Hard to know. Five months ago could we have even imagined the state we are in now so hard to imagine what five months from now will bring. Personally I would postpone the trip but I am not a risk taker.
"CultureV. I agree with your sentiments, I have decided to cancel my visit to America because I don’t want a restricted visit... I want to see everything......There is also a real chance of a second wave late Summer/ Autumn and I would not want to be caught in that. I have friends who have had the virus, if not lethal it is long term debilitating...... Roll on VacinationStay safe"
"You’ve made the right choice, albeit a heartbreaking one. I fear the decision would have been taken out of your hands eventually anyway - I just don’t see international leisure travel this year. The US is still in a dire state with respect to infections. As is the UK."
"We are due to visit in November. I am not confident it will happen. Even if Chicago is open for business, I’m not convinced I will want to travel. I will wait until the time grows closer and assess the situation then. We have never been it Chicago and we’re looking forward to our trip but there will be other opportunities if this one does not work out."
Yes Margarita .... you know this Virus.... It’s like Science Fiction. I am grateful for the contributions of the people on the forum though it gave me a really good feel for the situation in the USA and prompted my decision.All being well I will return to discover more of America in happier times
I’m sorry that you canceled your trip and I really hope that you can come back later! You had a real cool trip planned out. Best wishes to you!
"The talk of a second wave of virus, possibly worse than the first, is frightening. I think you made the sensible choice, Jiak. We will welcome foreign travelers again in the U.S. when travel is unrestricted.  Right now, our neighbors to the north in Wisconsin are telling Illinoisans to stay away, even if they have second homes there. So this is not the right atmosphere for pleasure trips."
"Really CV? I suppose we are similar, nobody is moving between England or Scotland or Wales and the Lake District is closed to everybody!I was of a mind to hang on until Cunard cancelled, that would have been better financially, but, there is a real chance that they will start limited sailings and theTransatlantic Crossing may very well be one of them. As I said my visit to US would be very limited so it is better to cancel"
