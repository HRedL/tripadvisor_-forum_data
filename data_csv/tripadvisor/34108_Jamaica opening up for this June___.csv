"Talk of hotels taking reservations for as early as June 1, Wow! I guess we will see what happens. Here’s the article I read from the Jamaica observer;…jamaicaobserver.com/news/…"
"The tourism industry isn't the government though. The Jamaican govt dictates whether or not they will lift the borders for tourists (and which tourists) to enter, not the tourism industry. Hotels can take reservations all they want... Doesn't mean anything, unfortunately. Case in point - AM Resorts has now released new opening dates twice. They don't even have tentative on their new re-opening dates in the press release. This just causes unnecessary stress and confusion for guests...I'm not getting my hopes up about a timeline or dates until I hear official word from the Jamaican govt."
"My opinion? I don't think Jamaica will open the borders to tourists by June 1st. When they do they might only to countries where the virus numbers are not that bad - so tourists from the US might be out of luck for a while. Also a lingering question - when they do, will they require a 2 week quarantine? Will there still be a mask requirement in place as there is now?It is my understanding that Jamaica is first taking applications for it's citizens to re-patriate and come home...so flights with those people might come in before June 1. So far my friends that are ""stuck"" there (friends who have homes there) and want to return to the US, Canada and Europe might be able to book a flight out the first week of June.Of course if the government decides to keep the borders closed, all bets are off."
"Do keep in mind that Jamaican residents that are ""allowed"" to return (they need a permission document from the Passport Immigration and Citizenship Agency [PICA]) and must spend 14 days in a quarantine facility.How is that going to work for tourists?"
No US citizen is ‘stuck’ here... flights are going out on Saturdays. The US Embassy posts the flights online.
"<< “ so tourists from the US might be out of luck for a while.” >>Not harping on you specifically, but I think when people try to consider the US as one, monolithic country they reveal that they really don’t understand just how large and diverse a place the US is.For instance, NY has 6x the number of cases and 12x the number of deaths as California... even though California has twice the population of NY. NY has 10x the number of cases and 27x the number of deaths as Texas, which is also nearly twice the population of NY.And even within NY, something like 90% of the cases are in two downstate counties, leaving the vast majority of the state virtually unaffected by the virus.The thing of it is is that we live in a global world today. Neither economics nor viruses care too much about such arbitrary constructs as national or state borders."
Does the Jamaican government give out any kind of financial subsidy during this pandemic? I can only imagine if there’s no financial aid that some people are probably needing to get back to work but at what cost? I’m itching to go back to Jamaica but I wouldn’t wanna jeopardize anyone. I think I will wait at least until the fall to see how things are handled.
"#6 of 6 ·Does the Jamaican government give out any kind of financial subsidy during this pandemic? @@@@@@@No. It does not. We don’t have “social services” here. ( food stamps, food banks, stimulus checks, unemployment, Etc..) We are on our own. There are charities that are putting together relief packages, but they won’t go to far. There is a very dark solid line dividing the classes. We’ve already decided that if we had to close our locations, we would still pay our staff full pay. Thankfully, we haven’t had to close and we’ve been busy."
"""No US citizen is ‘stuck’ here... flights are going out on Saturdays. The US Embassy posts the flights online.""My friends that are ""stuck"" have had their flights cancelled three times. None of them will re-book on another airline because of the cost, very prohibitive. I'm hearing you can get on a flight to Canada but have to transit through the US and many Canadians are not comfortable with that. So yeah, for now - they are stuck (they are also not tourists by the way, my friends have homes and live on-island 4-6 months per year.)""Not harping on you specifically, but I think when people try to consider the US as one, monolithic country they reveal that they really don’t understand just how large and diverse a place the US is."" I know you're not and I should say again, this is just my opinion on how Jamaica might open borders based on countries with less cases....there is no basis in any kind of fact, just really an opinion that's being tossed around. The thing is, should they decide to do that they will not care if a tourist is from New York or Iowa - the US is viewed as one country and if they go with that ""plan"" they will most probably not qualify it by state or airport.I can only speak to Negril but several hotels and resort are paying their employees either their full or part of their salaries. Last week the Negril Chamber and the TEF organized a food distribution - about 2000 showed up in force."
"Yes, Passion those things were put into place but do you have any idea how hard it is to actually implement any of them? Applying is a joke, receiving is even funnier. Utilities are being cut off.. people can’t pay their bills so they’re not paying their bills...JPS, Cornwall Communications, FLOW and NWC ARE disconnecting services.The lowering of GCT is not Corona related. The lowering of interest rates does not benefit every citizen. The things you mentioned sound great on paper, but they do not benefit the general population.Edited: 7:39 am, May 04, 2020 "
"Passion4diving, Thanks for the comprehensive answer to my previous question. Sounds like they have some things in place but like Iriestar said looks like it might be difficult for the average person to get access."
"""Yes, Passion those things were put into place but do you have any idea how hard it is to actually implement any of them? Applying is a joke, receiving is even funnier.""This guy is the Google King and his Google search was successful in finding out about all these programs that are ""available"" to the Jamaican people.But he has little to no ""real life"" experience in Jamaica so of course he would have no idea the mounds of red-tape for the average Jamaican to get through to take advantage of these programs. You know who benefits? Those with larger business, corporate and otherwise. The guy who brings him his beer at his lounge chair at Hedonism definitely DOES NOT.I hadn't heard of JPS disconnecting service but I fully expect they would. Several of my friends got their last bill and the rates have skyrocketed!"
"Rasta: you’re dead on. And yes, jps bills have tripled in some areas and there’s no explanation. I have friends who lost service and had to raise a massive stink to get it back."
"Linda: he googled all of that and most of it does not apply to a large majority of people. I own three businesses and if i have to close, and lay people off, I get nothing from the govt, nor do my employees. Passion is basically a tourist and while he tries to come off as knowledgeable, he really knows very little about Jamaica, the culture and the people."
I will try not to get involved in who knows what. I can totally believe that the average Jamaican is not getting any subsidies from the government. Things are really tough right now. Hopefully things get back to somewhat normal or a new normal sooner rather than later.
"I expected that Iriestar would comment, as the list of ""benefits"" that the Jamaican government claims to be providing has probably not impacted the residents/citzens of Jamaica. They just look good on paper for readers at the (guessing) IMF and World Bank. Nearly none of the items I'm post was published in the Jamaican media.I do have 30+ years of experience in Jamaica, and do know many of the peaks and valleys of the Jamaican culture but I certainly do not have the knowledge that comes from living there. However, I do not think I deserve the characterization from #14."
"Yes, Passion you do. You’re a tourist who googles information..and, hey, if that works for you; fine. But it doesn’t work for a forum that wants real information.: not googled from the internet. I don’t care how times you’ve “visited” the island.. you’re a VISITOR, not a citizen, not a resident and not privy to the whole picture of life on the island. I could’ve found the same things you posted.. in fact, I read those things in the newspaper and my opinions and comments still stand."
"Yes, hedo (passion) is the resident google master here. He constantly provides incorrect information, and people who don't know better take it at face value. He's wrong at least as much as he is right. When your only experience of a place is from a walled in all inclusive - which he proudly admits because he says he doesn't want to have to ""think"" while on vacation - you can't ""know"" a place. He does not know Jamaica. He knows resorts, and most of that comes from google.Edited: 10:32 pm, May 05, 2020 "
"""Passion is basically a tourist and while he tries to come off as knowledgeable, he really knows very little about Jamaica, the culture and the people.""I think it's spot on."
"So back to the topic at hand, if I have reservations for a week starting in late June, should I push? Sure don't want to, for many reasons."
"Yes, you should, for many reasons."
"<< ""So back to the topic at hand, if I have reservations for a week starting in late June, should I push? "" >>I think the more important follow up question to any of the general ""Will we be able to vacation in [_INSERT LOCATION_] during the month of [_INSERT MONTH_] ?"" type of questions on the various forums is...""Will a vacation in [__LOCATION__] during the month of [__INSERT MONTH__] actually be enjoyable to an extent that actually warrants devoting precious resources and time to such a trip?""There can be little doubt that a vacation to Jamaica in June will not resemble what a similar trip would have looked like one year ago... or one year from now. Or probably even six months from now.Of course, how divergent the comparison is will be a function of what type of trip you're planning. A stay at a hotel/condo resort with lots of meals at various restaurants will look very, very different. A self-catering stay at a private villa with a pool and a rental car to hit remote beaches will feel largely similar to an ordinary trip.Personally -- even discounting ""virus fears"" -- I would not want to spend my money or my time vacationing anywhere in June/July while airlines, resorts, restaurants, tours, excursions, etc are all trying to figure out how to operate their business in a post-COVID world. I simply cannot fathom how such a trip could be enjoyable."
"i'll give the same answer everyone has been giving for the past 2 months in the hundreds of threads asking this same, fundamentally unanswerable question- you can either hold off as long as possible and cancel at the last minute (or have your reservations cancelled for you by the airlines and hotel) or you can rebook now, for some random later date. what course of action you take depends on what your flight and hotel cancellation policies are and if you're able to commit to some random future date and are willing to x your fingers and hope things are back to 'normal' by that date."
I work in the tourism sector. Much thanks to hotels who are giving much as half minimum wage to its employers.Think though for the amount received is not enough to pay bills and buy food . And speaking about food. seem everything has sky rocketed in the supermarkets. plus the main electricity company is pushing for increase to an already high bill. Staying home will only drive the country into depression. So the government has to open the ports so the hotels can be open.
That's true .
"""The PM also stated that he will tighten the reins again is the numbers get too high.""I think this was more of a short-sighted economic decision as opposed to a health decision....same as they are doing here in the US where numbers are still on the rise in just about every state. It's short-sighted because if numbers get out of control in Jamaica where the healthcare is lacking there will be a major public health disaster, which the country managed to avoid in these first months. Having to ""shut down"" a second time will create even more economic havoc.Lets just all hope for the best - that every property, shop and restaurant is held accountable for compliance and that all people - residents and tourists also abide by ALL rules laid out by the MOH."
"We plan on going on our July trip. I know it will not be as carefree as other vacations there, but we are still looking forward to getting away. Our county has gone crazy! I'm concerned about the temperature checks. I lay in the sun ALL day and am worried it will effect the result and they think I'm sick. This whole COVID issue I think is kind of blown out of proportion, since the number of deaths is such a small percentage of our population. We had the same number of people die the year of Woodstock, during a pandemic and nothing was shut down and lives NOT effected with loss of income, jobs etc. I want my July vacation to be normal, but I doubt we are ever going back to any sort of normalcy since people believe we are all in danger. We received our flight confirmations, so that is encouraging!"
"Debra, your analysis of a pandemic impact ignores the huge potential danger. The pandemic of 1918 took 675,000 lives with more deaths occurring in the second wave than in the first. What is happening in the US is setting the stage for the COVID-19 second wave.The only way for this virus to impact Jamaica is by folks delivering it by flying in or arriving on ships. What would happen to Jamaica if it became know as a COVIDr-19 hot spot? Disaster on several dimensions.Look at what is now happening in Brazil when the government ignored medical advice such as your's seems to be."
"in a recent thread... https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14730… ...@Debra M said... ""I am in the herd immunity camp and believe it will not change the outcome continually staying at home. Other countries have proven that. I'm ready to go on my July vacation until someone tells me otherwise."" ...i directed her to this URL... https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achi… ...and highlighted these passages... What will it take to achieve herd immunity with SARS-CoV-2?As with any other infection, there are two ways to achieve herd immunity: A large proportion of the population either gets infected or gets a protective vaccine. Based on early estimates of this virus’s infectiousness, we will likely need at least 70% of the population to be immune to have herd protection.In the worst case (for example, if we do not perform physical distancing or enact other measures to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2), the virus can infect this many people in a matter of a few months. This would overwhelm our hospitals and lead to high death rates.In the best case, we maintain current levels of infection—or even reduce these levels—until a vaccine becomes available. This will take concerted effort on the part of the entire population, with some level of continued physical distancing for an extended period, likely a year or longer, before a highly effective vaccine can be developed, tested, and mass produced.The most likely case is somewhere in the middle, where infection rates rise and fall over time; we may relax social distancing measures when numbers of infections fall, and then may need to re-implement these measures as numbers increase again. Prolonged effort will be required to prevent major outbreaks until a vaccine is developed. Even then, SARS-CoV-2 could still infect children before they can be vaccinated or adults after their immunity wanes. But it is unlikely in the long term to have the explosive spread that we are seeing right now because much of the population will be immune in the future.Why is getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 to “get it over with” not a good idea?With some other diseases, such as chickenpox before the varicella vaccine was developed, people sometimes exposed themselves intentionally as a way of achieving immunity. For less severe diseases, this approach might be reasonable. But the situation for SARS-CoV-2 is very different: COVID-19 carries a much higher risk of severe disease and even death.The death rate for COVID-19 is unknown, but current data suggest it is 10 times higher than for the flu. It’s higher still among vulnerable groups like the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. Even if the same number of people ultimately get infected with SARS-CoV-2, it’s best to space those infections over time to avoid overwhelming our doctors and hospitals. Quicker is not always better, as we have seen in previous epidemics with high mortality rates, such as the 1918 Flu pandemic.*************i'm actually shocked that anyone would have the blls to say something like: ""I am in the herd immunity camp and believe it will not change the outcome continually staying at home. Other countries have proven that. I'm ready to go on my July vacation until someone tells me otherwise."""
"Debra: then volunteer to be tested when you land before you leave the airport... there’s talk that they’re allowing that for incoming visitors. Also, stay on the resort and practice hand hygiene, wear a mask and use social distancing. Resorts and hotels will be taking strict protocols and they should .. they might not pay their taxes for employees but they’ll try and keep them safe. God willing."
"Debra, you and your herd should self quarantine for 2 weeks before you enter.Then take a test before coming Most of us Jamaica lovers would never consider infecting the island we love ."
"actually, people who rely on herd immunity to take care of the crisis should quarantine 14 days BEFORE travel and 14 days AFTER arriving at their destination."
Good point !!
Has anyone from the U.S.A. traveled to Jamaica since the June 15th reopening? What was the experience like?
This question might be a good new topic. I am wondering myself if anyone who uses trip advisor is actually there currently and could give some real time info. I suspect not as no one has chimed in or posted yet.
"If you are on Facebook some Negril groups that I am a member of have people posting what their experience has been in the last week arriving in Jamaica. You definitely have to get a Covid test, have to have the address of where your staying, you also have to download an app where they can track you. Seems like people are saying you can go out you just have to follow the protocols. This is just hearsay I have just watched a few videos of people’s experiences. I’m sure if you go on to the Jamaica Covid app you would be able to get more information. Hope this helps a bit. I have not been through the process so again just going by what other people have said."
Some people no learn so gooder.
"So Linda, once you and have been on the plane with the virus what then?Should the whole plane go to the same place for isolation?Regardless of what pretty hotel you choose?What leverage do you have once your flying with the virus?And aren't you worried if they aren't considering that?"
"I was wondering and I guess you can...maybe assume that in the situation where the traveler tested positive, they contact all the passengers that were on the incoming plane? And quarantine them. I would want to know if I was on that plane.."
Hopefully they would contact the other travellers from the flight. They seem to be keeping a track of what your up to.
"Linda, do you understand why our borders are closed to US?So you'll bring it home indirectly from US?Hopefully = willfully ignorant"
Facebook groups for Jamaica have 100% more info that I find weird as I have been using This forums for years and it’s alway the other way just type in Montego Bay groups or Negril groups there Video 100 of post of people there now.
What's your point John?
"Islandlorna2 I am confused with what you are asking?Edited: 3:08 pm, June 22, 2020 "
Me to I guess he does not use Facebook groups .
"John.....he is a she, my name is Lorna that's my pic from my Facebook."

I'm in a few of those FB groups and have seen no first hand accounts - for example I didn't know that tourists staying in a hotel were required to download the app, I was under the impression (from the PM's FB page from a few weeks ago) - I understood that only tourists staying in private homes need to download the app (something I would need to do). If true, I'm glad all tourists would have to download that app though - just another way to test and trace. I also understood that all tourists were being ASKED not to leave their hotel property until their test results came back. Once ""clear"" they can't just go anywhere, it has to be within the ""resilience corridor"".""maybe assume that in the situation where the traveler tested positive, they contact all the passengers that were on the incoming plane? And quarantine them.""That wouldn't be necessary as all the people on the plane would be tested when they land. It would be nice to know that a passenger on my plane tested positive so I could seek out a test privately or quarantine for 2 weeks."
"My thinking on notifying the other passengers on the plane is that it would be part of contact tracing. Planes are a ""high risk"" situation. I did some looking into becoming a contact tracer here in the US. I could be wrong but I believe in a ""high risk"" situation we would be contacted and told to self isolate. Technically it wouldn't be quarantine."
