I am flying to Faro-Portugal in 3 weeks time. I would like to know if there is an epidemic whether it will affect my holiday?Im worrying so much.
You've posted your question on the Punta Cana forum. As to whether it will affect your holiday it is too early to tell. I would have thought it unlikely but who knows what could happen in a couple of weeks. I wouldn't worry right now. 
"sljabes,Really, come on now. Asking such a question on this forum will most likely get you an answer but you are smart enough to know that any answer provided wouldn't have any validity whatsoever. Everyone's crystal ball will be more than a bit foggy when trying to predict what may or may not happen with a potential global pandemic of flu. Will it affect your vacation? Probably in some way, but no one kows how it might affect you."
Sorry i actually meant pandemic but I think you understood that anyway. And Im sorry i wrote it in the wrong forum.Thanks for the replies anyway
"while i do not believe that such will happen with the actual lil virus i would say at the moment the world docs declare it a panademic-thingy-stuffy it will affect every travel everywhere, heck, in the worst case it would mean they stop flights from/to specific locations/countries and people may get stuck there to go on with their vacations.but actually it is not looking like any kind of such horror scenario.happy travelsMike"
