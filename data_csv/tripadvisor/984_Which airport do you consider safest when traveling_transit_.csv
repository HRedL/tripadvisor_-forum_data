"Many of us who are planning to go overseas probably have the same question on which airport is the best to transit through. I have recently been through Istanbul Airport and Hamd airport. Both I found to be great regarding the safety measures implemented. I think Istanbul airport even was the first to achieve ACI Airport Health Accreditation. When you arrive in Istanbul, your temperature will be taken using a thermal imaging camera or a forehead thermometer. The quarantine requirement has been lifted as well. I was also able to enjoy the Turkish Airlines business class lounge after it reopened and the service was great and everything was super organized. If you have traveled recently, please share you're experience or opinion on the best airports and the measures taken during COVID.Edited: 10:40 am, August 19, 2020 "
Taking temperatures does not ensure safety. The temperature test is ineffective if someone has covid-19 (and is infectious) yet remains asymptomatic. It's theatre at best.
i would not be too worried about the airport as simply being on a plane. Taking temperature is next to useless as it takes quite a few days for the virus to grow to the point of showing a temperature if any at all.A sardine can of an airplane is far worst that the airport
"Another one who's not particularly bothered about the airport, particularly if it takes public transport to get to/from. Temp checks are just window dressing afaics, I'm afraid the problem for the foreseeable future is travelling, period."
"Instead of airports, I'd be more concerned about which country or region the airport is located. For example, countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, NZ, or even Italy, all seem to have a handle on the virus. So I would not be concerned about transiting through airports in these countries.On the other hand, the US seems to have lose all control over the virus, esp in New York, Florida, and California. And I would not transit through those areas if I have a choice."
"My wife traveled recently and wasn't concerned about the 2 busy airports or the flight. The rental car shuttle, which was packed, was what made her nervous."
"Thermal checks are theatre, nothing more. The 'safety of an airport' cannot be quantified. There are far too many unknowns in the equation of safety at an airport: the number of people in the terminal building, how they've managed basic hygiene measures, their situation at home, their own health status, and much more.Rather than focus on the terminal building or the lounge my first priorities would be to ensure hand hygiene (no gloves, they're magnets for organisms), physical distancing whenever possible, and wearing a mask as advised."
"""On the other hand, the US seems to have lose all control over the virus, esp in New York, Florida, and California. And I would not transit through those areas if I have a choice.""At least NY, which suffered greatly in the beginning, has taken steps to try to keep control over a second surge. You can not enter NY (or NJ, CT, MA, VT and possibly others) without a required a 14-day quarantine and/or proof of a recent negative Covid-19 test. NYC has taken steps to have checkpoints at bridges and tunnels entering the city and also teams at the NYC metro airports and train stations to make sure people are filling out the required Entry Form. Different States have taken different approaches, so you have to be knowledgeable about the restrictions for each airport you travel thru and of course take all necessary precautions if you choose to fly at this time."
"If I were inclined to fly, which I'm not, I would want to use airports in jurisdictions with good contact/trace programs, in case I were exposed to the virus somewhere at the airport or on a plane.In the US most efforts in this regard are primitive, and I would not count on anyone being organized enough to do effective contact tracing. New York is trying, and in addition to asking people to fill out forms at airports, under a new executive order NYC hotels, airbnbs and the like are supposed to get guests to fill out such forms and turn them over to the city. However, whether those forms end up in the hands of people who know what to do with them, I have no idea.I have heard that some cities/countries in Asia and Oceania are good at this."
"Temperature checks serve a limited purpose only. As mentioned, asymptomatic people are everywhere. It's definitely not the ultimate defense.I feel the best defense is an airport that requires passengers to wear masks at all times. That is one enforceable policy since it's visible. Hand sanitizers should be par for the course these days so nothing unusual. I understand that Singapore now requires all transit passengers to stay in a Transit Holding Area. That's a good idea to restrict passenger movement and enforcing social distancing."
"What happens when you arrive in Istanbul and the test reveals you have a temperature? Do you then have more tests? I can see advantages to Turkey in identifying people who are arriving in their country who have covid, but it doesn't reassure me as a traveller when people will have already been mingling around at the departure airport and sitting in the aircraft for a few hours.What am I missing here?"
"Temperature checks really aren't doing anything. Not everyone with covid has a temperature, especially if they're newly infected or during the incubation period. There's plenty of asymptomatic people as well. They're doing it to make people feel safer, but really don't serve much useful purpose. You can help protect yourself by behaving sensibly, being scrupulous about hand hygiene and wearing an effective mask, couple that with a face shield as well if you want. Personally I'd want to make sure whichever destination I travelled to had a good working track and trace system, coupled with an effective app."

"Yeah, I do think Istanbul Airport is the only airport in the world that is ready for the normalization process since it is relatively new, they are able to adapt fast to accommodate to the new safety measures that have been enforced due to COVID 19. I am not concerned about being on the plane, I've been on a Turkish airline flight recently and they been carrying out international disinfection protocols on their planes. So with the HEPA filters and the nature of the air inside the cabin, the risk of being in contact with the virus is already so low. Even the busses used for passenger transfers between the planes and Istanbul airport are also disinfected with similar methods. And I agree the concern is neither the airport nor the airplane but actually the destination.As long as you keep your distance you should be fine, I think life must go on."
">>>Personally I'd want to make sure whichever destination I travelled to had a good working track and trace system, coupled with an effective app.<<<Totally agree. I'd be more positive about any kind of health check if it took place before boarding. Or even better, before entering the airport, lol!"
