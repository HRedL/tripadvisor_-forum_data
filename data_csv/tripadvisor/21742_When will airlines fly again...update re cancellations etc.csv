"Saw this, not my words!Just if anyone has flights etc booked/being cancelled/updated::https:/…"
"It's a chink of light in these gloomy days thanks for sharing Caz. I have read that WizAir plan on resuming flights soon, and Turkish Airlines are resuming domestic flights from mid May."
"That TUI Information is out of date it's now All package Holidays up to 11th June that have been cancelled ✈️Edited: 6:29 am, April 29, 2020 "
"I can't see anyone flying anywhere soon. Until they get a vaccine, sort out lockdown, open borders to tourists etc.Think the airlines should stop selling flights until they have definite dates to fly again. Taking peoples money, falsely giving people hope! Everyday something in the press about airlines and holidays"
"Love Holidays are getting better. I have just received notification that they are giving me a credit note for a holiday cancelled in May, and if the voucher is not used by the end of July I can apply for a refund which seems fair. It is all a bit uncertain at the moment regarding flights. Yesterday I read that President Sisi has declared a 'state of emergency' for three months, whatever that means."
Egypt is perpetually in a State of Emergency - This is just the latest extension.See https:/…
"My thoughts entirely, BBeckett.A cynical ploy to dodge their legal obligations and one I would be far from happy with.They know full well there is not a hope in hell of the credit note being redeemed by July (and in reality much later) so they have in effect extracted an interest free loan."
@ Caz on #3. They are already starting. Wizz Air are operating from this Friday! And from what i am hearing the flight is pretty full. Although i am guessing they are blocking out a lot of seats.
"Lol you think anyone is going to be flying in a pandemic, borders shut to tourists, sat together in a plane, killing more people, not thinking of NHS.....crazy wizzair.Only see repatriation, cargo flights running still anywhere.Who would get on a plane in lockdown/pandemic?"
I suggest you read this link.https:/…It isn’t quite so simple as ‘Wizz resuming flights” There will be a restricted list of destinations and refunds are not guaranteed.
"The Wizz flights are not repatriation flights or cargo though, the are genuine flights. People will fly because there are unfortunately people who don't give a toss about lockdown. As someone who has to go to work every day still, it's pretty obvious that there are a lot more cars on the road this week, people are getting restless.Granted, you would be going against government advice to travel and personally i can't think of anything worse than getting on a plane at the moment or going abroad but the fact remains, some people will."
"I agree with you Caz no one will be going on a holiday anytime soon. If you look at the latest figures for deaths in the UK from Covid 19 it is in excess of 26,000. The Government never factors in the deaths in care homes or at home when releasing the figures.Also has WizzAir considered if the countries they are flying to want to take tourists from the country in Europe with the second highest figure of Covid 19 fatalities? I love Turkey and I am sure they are keen to have tourists back, but how willing are they to accept tourists from a country with a high fatality rate from the virus?.

"True OrgandopAs the BBC say, it will be a lot of planning to get airports/airlines/flights up and running again.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52441652"
The £25 ‘incentive’ to forgo a cash refund in favour of a credit voucher would suggest that the company’s financial position Is very precarious.
"Hi Organdop, i got that email today too.I follow easyjet on Facebook and Twitter. They're giving £extra pp if you take a voucher.Looking now to change my flight to Turkey in June. No fee and no additional price to pay :)I had email from travel republic re hotel and i can rebook or cancel for refund.Martin Lewis, moneysavingexpert, is doing an online survey re holiday and airline companies. I've completed it. He will take results to CAA, govt, reg bodies etc. https:/…Travel-booking-experiences-MSE"
"Martin Lewis is great. He makes an impact. Companies take action when he exposes them, already more companies are offering refunds."
"Hi Caz, maybe I missed it in the easyJet email!?I know there are no changing fees but I thought you had to pay any fare difference!?Kind regards"
#20 yes you do need to pay if any difference in flight price.I didn't as there wasn't any as said.If the new flight is less than you paid you won't get refund back.I played around with dates to get flights with no additional cost :)
"Wizzair first flights, as said they're for people flying home or to work. Not for holiday tourists.Crazy as another way to spread virus in lockdown as no health checks and not read that anywhere. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-827…"
Martin Lewis answers question on Coronavirus travel refunds and your rights.https:/…
"Some quality journalism there from the Daily Fail. Putting up the airlines full range of flights on a graphic, despite them not flying to all of them, and a picture of a passenger in a ‘full hazmat suit’ which is nothing of the sort."
"Laughable daily fail, all of the papers seem to sensationalise it all.I just know as tourists we are not flying anywhere soon"
"We might not have the opportunity to fly to destinations soon, however nothing is stopping you from making a Booking.I find having something to look forward to is part of the fun. Also, it will certainly please the companies, airlines, accommodation etc that you book with, who can begin to fill their very empty pages. Keep well allAnthony"
Doesn't sound like a fun holiday:https:/…

"Cybermadge I've just seen all their posts! On everything i comment on. How sad they are! Blocked and reported.Its the troll again, how do TA keep letting them come back on, surely they can track IP address.Such a sick sad individual. I don't need this when i have just lost my Dad recently and obviously we can't go to el gouna.Thankfully i can block them and hope you all report and block too as i know you are and will x"
What on earth did you do (or not do) to set this weirdo off?
I’ve clicked & reported on every post but wonder if that’s adding fuel to a sick mind when they see they are getting attention .
"Caz • It’s a woman? I vaguely remember someone having a go at you a while back but this recent stuff seems to be a whole new ballgame. I’ve annoyed people on here and been called a name or two but nothing like this. If it helps, I very much doubt anyone (even your internet ‘stalker’) thinks that any of it is even remotely true.Edited: 12:05 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"What have i missed, is Amanda back again?"
Think perhaps Cybes is right. Ignoring may work. Zap but don't comment.
"I doubt it. It’s “Zapping” that seems to irritate him/her. He/she, for example, keeps reposting what is essentially the same message. TA won’t (rightly) leave this sort of personal attack on view but eventually the troll gives up. Like General McArthur, they will return. It will of course be with a brand new ID.Edited: 12:37 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"True Brian.Yes Amanda/warmdayz/warmwks/passenger244567/Jackie/snd any other names used.TA block but she comes back again and again.Of course none of her words are true!!!I block immediately and report all posts.One day I will use my powers to find out who it is....then the Law can take over.Shame they're so sad, sick and socially dusturbed!!"
"Oh well here's to a happy VE DAY♣️Edited: 2:44 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"I recall Amanda/warmdayz but today’s stuff seems a grade or two nastier than I remember. He/she could off course be deteriorating but the world is full of mentally challenged characters. So, Out of general curiosity, are you sure It’s the same person?"
"I'm sure it is, due to the way the wording is, spelling etc.Weird how they suddenly reappeared. Maybe thought they'd try their luck again :("
"You could well be right. It’s just that today’s stuff reads so pointlessly personal and nasty that It seems like it could be a different person or a copycat . As I recall, “Amanda” even managed to ask a sensible question or two along with all the stupid insults/remarks. Indeed wasn’t it Clint or somebody else that set “Amanda” off?I remember “Amanda” getting insulting with me once or twice and, being quite pleasant to me on others. Today’s troll is being nasty to the point of psychosis.Anyway, nasty is nasty and I don’t suppose it matters whether they’re all the same or not at the the end of the day. The answer, however, could indicate psychological deterioration and perhaps help identify the perpetrator(s).Time will tell."
"I'm sure Brian, time will tell.I don't think it's Amanda then. But it's definetly the same person as before. They only target me for some reason. Just wish TA would take action once and for all but all my emails just get a standard response.Even the Police don't do anything with online trolls at the moment but i think the law is changing finally.Then these trolls will get their just desserts as they say."
I'm pretty sure it's the same person. If they stick around long enough you see what they say about certain hotels etc are the same as the previous removed person.Maybe they will give up at some point. How people can be so vile i'll never get though.
"The username is no longer hyperlinked, so I assume it’s gone."
"Thinking about it, Just like today’s troll, “Amanda” used to complain about people posting the same comments/opinions over and over again. So, maybe it’s the same person after all. If it is, the vitriol is getting worse and it’s quite likely that their resentment and instability is spiralling downhill.As far as the username is concerned, if it’s gone, it’s child’s play to set up another and going to an Internet cafe (when they reopen) solves any problem of a PC signature and/or IP.addrress.Edited: 5:59 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"I'm sure they'll be back targeting me as that's all they do. Not seen anything else each time on their last 4 profile names. I've emailed Trip Advisor again but not holding much hope for anything but their standard response.As said i will take this further if it continues. I have been screenshotting all their posts.Something else to do in lockdown!Have a good weekend everyone. Im on my balcony soaking up the sun again, before the weather changes!"
"The targeting is dreadful. Nasty and unnecessary by anyone at any time.But, it is off topic, here,Let's keep to the topic, as Boris is about to pronounce on UK Borders, and quarantining, this evening at 7pm.Keep well allAnthony KEdited: 2:34 am, May 10, 2020 "
"Hi.Fortunately ,I have Received a refund from EasyJet and Travel Republic, for my flight and hotel in El Gouna Paul"
That's good Paul. When were you going?
"HiFrom the 18th to the 26 of March, I got the refund s about 10 days ago.Paul"
"OK colleagues ... the UK PM has just said ...""I will not say that Quarantining for those arriving into Britain through Airports and all other Ports will definitely happen. When it MIGHT start and what the length of the Period of Isolation would have to be, and when re-consideration might happen. ""Anthony K"
Glad you didnt wait too long then Paul
Our flight is still scheduled for the 12th june with Tui We wont be going but they leaving it a bit too close to the deadline only 3 weeks away fco still saying non essential travel
"Most airlines and agents are cancelling 7 days before due to volumes of claims they're then having to sort out. So doing in date order.Edited: 5:17 pm, May 19, 2020 "
"We are the same, 12th June with TUI.We know where we want to rebook to and when. Just frustrating having to wait for the official cancellation and refund credit 20% incentive to come through and hope the alternate isn't booked up when it does.."
"Trents, I suspect you’ll be waiting a long time. I was supposed to travel 30th March and still not had flights refunded from TUI. I rebooked but with EasyJet. I was hoping my TUI refund would pay for my new booking but it looks like I’ll have to pay out for the second booking and still wait for my refund."
"Hi Stevie, it's not a full refund I'm after. I've got another TUI holiday to switch over to for next year. I could switch it now online and pay the extra but want to wait on that 20% incentive as would cover a big chunk of the cost.Edited: 7:41 am, May 20, 2020 "

"Agree with Trents, we are awaiting cancellation but will happily transfer to next year but we want the 20% as the same holiday is significanlty more expensive. They are not helping themselves."
""" Our flight is still scheduled for the 12th june with Tui We wont be going but they leaving it a bit too close to the deadline only 3 weeks away fco still saying non essential travel ""It's all a financial game that they are playing, no doubt driven by their bean counters. When we were cancelled in March it was literally 10 hours before we were due to fly and we wasted the cost of an overnight hotel stay and 14 nights parking in Manchester.Eventually got a refund after about 6 weeks."
"Tui are cancelling 2 weeks before, they're working their way through in date order otherwise they'd never cope with everyone's request for refunds etc. Mind you they can't cope now!Fingers crossed for you and you get refund soon after."
