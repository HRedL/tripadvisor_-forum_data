"after Avianca Holdings and Latam Group, now Aeromexico is the third large Latin American airline to file for court protection (Chapter 11) in the U.S.:https://vuela.aeromexico.com/reorganizacion/…"
Airlines are a thing of the past. You aren’t and shouldn’t be going anywhere. Stay where you are & get used to it. This is your new life moving forward.
"Once a vaccine is available that works, life will get back to normal and airlines will still fly. It has in the past with other pandemics and epidemics. Hopefully most everyone thinks with a positive attitude not a negative one."
"A) you are making a lot of assumptions, none of which are actually founded in fact. B) you wanting a vaccine doesn’t mean there will ever be one. C) nothing I said is negative. I believe it’s called an opinion.Going back to the garbage society we used to have would be absolutely the worst thing that could happen to this planet."
"Oh dear! Sidestep is back with more of their << Isolationism is the new way. >> theories from the Masks on the Plane topic and similar from the UK Quarantine Proposal topic.By definition an opinion is ""a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.""So while you have criticized yvr1 for not having anything founded in fact, neither are your constant opinions about air travel and people's lives going forward. According to the UK Quarantine Proposal topic, you have established your own rules and behaviors to suit you. Well, that's fine but stop telling everyone else how they should be or will be living!!! Not only does everyone not want to spend the rest of their lives in their current location like you apparently do, but how they want to live their lives is none of your business!Edited: 11:51 am, July 01, 2020 "
"“ you are making a lot of assumptions, none of which are actually founded in fact... nothing I said is negative. I believe it’s called an opinion.“—-But that is exactly what your opinion is, just an assumption."
"Agreed. There are a lot of opinions around, and some them have no basis in fact at all. It's my opinion that yvr's view is far more founded in fact than sidestep's. But is my view founded in fact? I don't know. It seems to be from where I'm sitting, but then I would say that, wouldn't I?Gee, please no more, sidestep."
">>Airlines are a thing of the past<< Why are you on this Air Travel forum exactly?>> This is your new life moving forward.<< That is also quite an assumption. What facts is it founded in?>>Going back to the garbage society we used to have would be absolutely the worst thing that could happen to this planet.<< Which society would that be? There are quite a few on this planet. Are they all garbage, or just your miserable life?Edited: 1:29 pm, July 01, 2020 "
