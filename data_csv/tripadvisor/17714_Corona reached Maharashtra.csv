"The cat is out of the bag ,as they say , regarding Carona Virus. I don't think any country can stop it running it's course but they can delay it's onset and hope it dies out before it gets to be an epidemic."
I don't think cats are to blame this time Yorkie T.As with SARS it jumpped from Bats to Civet Cats and onto Humans.This time they think it COVID19 was straight from Bats to Humans.No cats this time so the cat bag is safe.....!!Hmmmmm.All the best everyone....No sneezing....!!
"I was wondering what is the difference between nipah virus and corvid 19, nipah seemed more deadly but less transmissible , I would say the Indian response to nipah was very good considering and would expect the current Corona virus to be of less risk though still very serious."
Infection has reached Mumbai..Govt on high alert..many flights cancelled..Ipl matches will be played without spectators this year.
