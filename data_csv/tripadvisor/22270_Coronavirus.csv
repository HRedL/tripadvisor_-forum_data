"We are planning a trip over Spring Break, heading down from Michigan. As the fear of this virus spreads, I’m getting confused about if we should still take our trip or not. Are any of you planning on changing your trip plans? Are you seeing any change within Gatlinburg? I keep saying it’s not an issue, but with major colleges closing down and all the fear, it’s starting to get to me!"
The news sure makes it scary.We are booked for Gatlinburg and Myrtle Beach in April. I'm not going to cancel unless it gets really bad. I'm taking all precautions that I can.
"Currently there are only a few confirmed cases in TN.I am sure as more testing is done, numbers will increase.Be sure to wash your hands often and do not touch your face. Hand sanitizer should be in your pocket. I am 68 years old with few health issues. But, I am in the more susceptible age group so my plans may change for my trip in May but you will have to decide for yourself."
"From West Michigan, leaving Tuesday!!! Go Green"
We're from the same area! Glad to hear you're still heading down - have a great vacation!!!
"I will keep an eye on it the next few weeks. I also know how important it is to keep the economy running and visiting tourist towns is the best way to do that, but I want to be safe & do the right thing."
"I think the news is ""hyping"" it up - I'm already a complete germaphobic person and worried about the flu, too. We tend to open doors with paper towels instead of our hands because I'm so germ aware, so - we already take precautions. I'm just trying to judge what is media hype vs. reality!"
I'm not concerned at this point. I always take precautions like opening restroom doors with a paper towel or my shirt tail and I wash my hands with soap and water and use hand sanitizer often as well. So for me I'm doing nothing different. I just got back from Orlando and spent the week before that in the Gatlinburg area and had no concerns about being there. I'll believe all the media hype and doom and gloom when I see it. I was just at my doctors office and they are not taking any precautions beyond normal. They said it was just another viral upper respiratory issue like any flu. The CDC director just today said they do not expect most people to develop serious illness from this.
The elderly are the highest risk especially with underlying conditions. I do not believe it is hype. Social distancing seems to be a big help in reducing cases.
Perhaps this article will be of interest in your decisionhttps:/…
The author is a senior doctor in a major European hospital. She asked to remain anonymous because she has not been authorized to speak to the press.Makes me suspicious anytime the media prints an article from an anonymous source. Where are all the individual doctors that should be willing to speak about this for the public good if it is really so bad for the masses?
"Hi, we are supposed to arrive on Saturday to enjoy Gatlinburg. We have been planning this trip for a long time and if we were to cancel we'd lose every cent we paid for our rental. We are younger, in good health and are very aware of the precautions to impact your health. My wife is a registered nurse so she helps us stay on top of things in that regard. So we are going to go and enjoy ourselves!"
"If you think of it, update when you get back! I'd love to hear if you feel that it's still just as busy or not. We're going to keep a watch out and decide once we get a little closer. I really appreciate all the responses so far, thank you!"
No cases in TN have been reported in the Gatlinburg area so far. The same may not be true a few days and weeks from now. What really concerns me is that you go on vacation have a wonderful time and then get told to self quarantine when you get home because of a new case while you were there. I guess it is a chance that we all take even if we just go out to eat in our home town!
"My husband is a pilot, so even in my own home, I feel ""unsafe"" - beyond me worrying about him getting sick, we're also worried about his job security. There are a lot of unknowns. Mainly, if we come to the mountains, we stay outdoors and hike - but I'm not even sure if it's ""safe"" or recommended to go out to eat, etc. I'm just not sure how bad it will get and how to approach it. My husband isn't a worrier, but I am, so we're trying to balance each other out with all of your advice, haha!"
I am also planning to go next week with kids. Been looking to see what f attractions are planning on closing
Same issue here. Coming from Michigan to Gatlinburg for spring break. I figure it’s probably as likely to contract anything here as it is there so I might as well go :)
Coming down on Saturday from Cincinnati! Everyone enjoy your vacation! ❤️
"I’m so relieved to see I’m not the only one concerned on here. My fiancé and I are getting married in a couple weeks and we’re doing our honeymoon in gatlinburg. We’re a little concerned to how much our honeymoon will be affected by this virus, the two big things we’re doing are the mountains and Dollywood, the latter has me nervous. I have taken some precautions should the worst happen, I upgraded our room and got a suite with a kitchen."
"If you wait to see it to believe it, it will already be too late. This isn't media ""hype."" All the media is doing is REPORTING the news."
"Larken Parr, you have it correct. If I was going to be worried about anything in the area, it would be going somewhere with a large number of people in a relatively defined space like Dollywood.DeMon86, there has been a lot of misinformation in the media as well on this unfortunately. One perfect example was initial media reports claiming that toilet paper and paper masks were from the same fibers, and the concentration was going to be on making masks so there was going to be a toilet paper shortage. That's since been proven untrue, but still has resulted in local stores being completely out of toilet paper."
We are heading to Gatlinburg 3/21-3/27 we are not cancelling. We know we may have to make adjustments once we are there in case things are closed. I’d be happy to let you know how it is when we go. Or are you going on the same dates.
"We are leaving for Gatlinburg too tomorrow, Friday the 13th. Glad we won’t be the only ones there! Hoping the Food City is well stocked."
"We were supposed to leave this Saturday, 03/14, but just cancelled. A personal friend, who is an emergency room physician, shared the article below with me and strongly warned against any unnecessary travel. When it comes to the safety of my family and I, I decided to to defer to his expertise. It's just not worth the risk to do otherwise.https:/…"
I would love to know as well. im planning to come from kentucky but i dont know what to do
Me too! Not sure what to do coming from kentucky
We are planning a trip to smokies too from Ohio. Wow.I Am not sure what to do either since we cannot get a refund we decided to go. But not I am not sure. Julie
I haven't heard about any closings in Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge...not yet anyways.
My husband and I are still going next weekend. But we will be avoiding Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge due to the crowds.
"We are a big “healthy” lol group going up to gatlinburg for spring break, we’re going from Miami. Praying this thing is over soon."
We are traveling from Belleville Ontario Canada the 15th threw 20th any precautions or closures we should be aware of? We are loaded with sanitizer and will wash hands frequently. We don't wanna stop living life from fear.
We are booked March 27th to the 30th we are still going I’m either goons get sick here in Louisville or suck in Gatlinburg I’d rather be sick in the mountains
I’m supposed to be going March 20th. Hoping places are still open when we get there.
"My real concern is Gatlinburg attractions shutting down, not as worried as to the virus though i know its not something to joke about. I'm starting to see more and more places close down due to the virus, Disney among recent places. I just dont want to drive all the way out to Gatlinburg to find out they shut down every attraction I am going for, fingers crossed though."
"My 2 children and I are driving from MO for spring break, and staying at a cabin in the woods. I’m not planning on doing activities where we would be around a lot of people-going hiking at smoky mountain national park, outdoor activities (as long as the weather cooperates!). I am still going as of now. I don’t think we will be at that much more of a risk doing that then we would at home."
"We are from Michigan and still planning on going. We are not sick and have a cabin rented in the mountains. Even if we have to stay in the cabin, we will be there."
We have plans books for spring break too to pigeon forge and getting a little worried myself... im here for answers with you!
"My family also plans on visiting Pigeon Forge for Spring Break, coming from Florida March 22nd. With the mass frenzy of panic that I started to see on the news the past few days, I did contemplate canceling our trip BUT after much thought decided not to. I pray for us all who plan to visit and everyone please WASH YOUR HANDS!!!!!"
"Washing hands is very important but I wish people would sneeze and cough into their elbow. I was at my doctor office in early February and even though there was a sign about coughing, an older gentleman(?) openly coughed. It really irritated me but I said nothing.People need to be more considerate in this day and age. Almost everything is cancelled in the Louisville area. Even The obligation to attend mass has been lifted until further notice in our archdiocese (Indianapolis)Dollywood plans on opening as usual but has cancelled Media day. Now that Disney has closed its parks, I can imagine that Dollywood would have to follow their example at some point."
"Yes, please update! To all that visit. We planned to go April 1-8, but all schools in Michigan have now closed. I’m leaning towards canceling - but plan to wait a week or so before I make our final decision. I want to protect the older population as best that I can, and also the uncertainty of things makes me wary. I’ve even heard talk of closing state borders! It’s just crazy. But I’d love to hear from anyone there or headed there!!! Thanks to everyone :)"
"I don't think it's unreasonable to worry about things closing or being cancelled over the next few weeks. That's going to happen. As for deciding whether or not to travel, I don't believe it's an issue of ""living in fear"" or ""being healthy enough"" - it comes down to the very real science that taking measures to limit exposure to contagions, slows the spread of the disease, which in turn flattens the bell curve and eases the burden on the medical communities so they can focus on the truly ill. I think if you're going to enjoy the park and nature you will be happy. If you're going to enjoy ""attractions"" and busy public places, those types of places are going to be facing a lot of uncertainty over the next few weeks."
Tara...you are exactly right
Well said Tara
"We're heading to Gatlinburg next Friday. Definitely not scared, nor cancelling our vacation. Just taking the usual precautions. If Gatlinburg and surrounding areas were to shut down their events and theme parks then we'll just hang out at our rental cabin, enjoy the view & fresh air. Still a win-win in our opinion."
"Follow Yankeeinthesouth on YouTube. He & his wife are keeping everyone updated with the goings-on in Gatlinburg & surrounding areas. They're definitely ""in-the-know"" for that area."
I am going to the Gatlinburg area leaving tomorrow for a week with.my family and grandkids. We will take common sense precautions bb8 it no plans to cancel anything.
"First case was confirmed in Knox county yesterday, but there were very few details (except that they went through the airport there). It's a judgement call for anyone to go or not. I assume there will be a ""domino"" effect of closures as more confirmed cases are announced. The problem with Gburg and surrounding area is that so many people are not locals-so it's a bigger gamble what you're getting exposed to.D"
Headed down from Wisconsin on 3/21. Still planning on going at this point. Staying in Sevierville. Will use common sense approach and avoid crowded areas. Planning to spend as much time as possible in the park.
"We are planning a trip there next week, my only concern at this point is closings. I would hate to be there and not be able to go to some of the attractions."
My husband and I are heading there the end of March. We do not plan to cancel as of yet. It is my husbands 50th birthday so I pray all goes well!
I know what you mean me and my husband an our kids have planned a trip to Gatlinburg for next weekend . I guess we'll just see how this plays out until then
My family was planning a trip in April but we have now cancelled the trip we are in our fiftys and we live in a very small town in georgia. We too that it was all blower out of proportion but it has now hit our hometown so this is not hype and I don't think anyone is safe
"A tip for those using rentals: some companies only provide toilet paper and paper towels for a couple of days to get you started. If you have a longer stay, either bring that with you or request in advance, with confirmation, that they give you enough for the duration of your stay if they are able.

"If your coming for the moonshine tastings, aquarium, go-karts, and other attractions that take money, you may want to reconsider visiting. If you're coming for the natural beauty of the area, the scenic views, and the things that take little money (other than a little bit for gas money, which is currently a bargain), please continue with your plans. Even dining, you can get orders to go, if you're worried about infection.We had a change of plans for this weekend due to cancelled, large scale events, but couldn't work out the logistics to make it, but we'll certainly get there during the next month while everything else is cancelled or postponed."
We are also leaving for Gatlinburg on Sunday march 15th. My sister is trying to talk me out of it.but the cabin is payed for so we are still going.im sure I could get it right here at home. So why not go.
Dollywood: The theme park announced it is delaying its season opening until March 28.
"B.B., as mentioned above, Dollywood has pushed their opening date back two weeks. Other than that, there's been nothing about closings, etc.I think the point of the previous comment is those are all places with a lot of folks in a relatively small area. Physically, it's more likely to catch something from another person in a place like that vs. wandering around in the national park."
We are suppose to be there on Sunday. Sad that Dollywood will not be open. Tried to get a refund from our cabin rental and they flat out refused.
"I have heard that it's starting to get busy as spring breaks get started, but it's not what it typically has been this time of year."
"Get real, it won’t be"
"Blount and knox county schools (very nearby Local communities) are both on spring break next week so I am curious to see how many “locals” keep their Smokies area spring break plans. Today in parts of Blount county and in Knox county the grocery stirs are out of nearly everything following yesterday’s first confirmed Knox case. People in this immediate area are freaking out but also need the business. Whatever you decide to do, just practice good respiratory behavior, wash your hands, and consider spending more time in the park. There will be Business closures. If you’re scared To go in a restaurant, order takeout. Increasingly restaurants are offering to bring to go orders our curbside. The service industry and small businesses will hurt the most here."
Please read all of this. Be safe. https:/…
Tennessee is now up to 26 confirmed.
"Anyone know of Airbnb's cancellation policy as of right now? With everything going on, we are considering canceling our trip next week. Not happy about it, but don't want to drive down and have everything close..."
Anyone know anything about Westgate resorts closing ? Website says still open ?
Here’s statements for Pirates Voyage and Dolly’s Stampede:https:/…https:/…2695246393858595Here’s some information from Pigeon Forge: https:/…travel-advisoryHere’s some news features: https://www.wbir.com/mobile/article/news/loc…https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Sevier-Co-l…
"As of today (3-13-20) Dollywood, Dolly's Stampede, and Pirate's Voyage are all closed right now. Dollywood is set to open on March 28."
"I have a cabin rental company that is also refusing to refund even a partial amount. There are also some other pre-paid expenses to local businesses that I have not been able to recover.I get it that they have a business to run, but at the same time this is a dangerous situation to some individuals. I have family members that have been exposed and are awaiting test kits.As someone who has frequented the Smokey Mountain area often, I'm afraid I will not be back."
"We have a place booked with AirBnb and as of today, they are not refunding us if we cancel. Not sure if that will change in the next few weeks, but it’s making the decision hard for us. This feels unprecedented and I feel like refunds should be a thing because of it, but time will tell I guess?"
"Also heading there from Michigan, but not until the end of April. Will be keeping a close watch, hopefully will not have to cancel! Have a safe trip if you go."

"Tesbrik, I don't think stores being out of supplies and/or closing early is unique to that area. We have many stores here in Birmingham that are out of basic supplies, and the Publix chain here announced they're closing early starting tomorrow."
"Tesbrik, I think you made a thoughtful decision. A lot of our stores are out of more than just ”basic supplies “ The next week in particular is going to be very “up in the air” for the area. When we go to our house in Pittman Center (Gatlinburg) I’m anticipating only taking whatever we already have at home and not relying on the Burg Food City.ETA - also agree on the social isolation approach.Edited: 4:51 am, March 14, 2020 "
"We are getting ready to start the final leg of our long drive. Is there anything open in Gatlinburg? I’d hate to get there and have nothing to do in town. IsnDollywoodnthenonlynthing shut down? What about the other tourist/family attractions like Ripley’s, zip lines, etc.?"
"Hi, everyone! We are booked for Spring Break starting 3/21. We can get out of our accommodations without any penalty. So far, we haven't canceled. Our main reason for coming is GSMNP. However, I am worried that the park is going to decide to close. I just saw this morning that the Washington Monument closed, and I wouldn't be surprised if other NP's followed suit. They have to think about the Visitor Centers, restrooms, etc. and protecting both their staff and guests when making this decision. Honestly, at this point, I will be surprised if they don't close."
"Rufdogsmom,The National Park Service has created a page with information related to the pandemic: https:/…public-health-update.htmI would keep an eye on it for updates. It’s hard to predict what they will do in the future for the GSMNP, but to this point outdoor Parks in closer proximity to more cases, like Mount Rainier, have remained open.I wish you the best.Edited: 9:54 am, March 14, 2020 "
"gonecoastal601,If you have trip insurance, you should be able to get most of your money back, depending on the t & c of the policy. I hope your family members are okay and hope everything works out with the companies to your satisfaction."
Are restaurants open ?
"Hahahjb,Yes, most establishments, including restaurants, remain open. See https:/…travel-advisory for the few attractions that are closed.Edited: 11:40 am, March 14, 2020 "
Dollywood and Dolly Parton stampede have closed. We are still going match 23 and getting our refund from these two venues was no problem.
"Dollywood has postponed their opening until March 28th, Dixie Stampede and the Voyager have postponed their opening. As of now no other closings. Restaurants and shops are open. Our mountains and trails are all open and a great way to social distance."
"LancasterPartyof7, as of now, the only things closed are Dollywood, Dolly's Stampede and the Pirate Show - all in Pigeon Forge."
"Rufdogsmom, I see Washington Monument and parks like Great Smoky Mountains National Park entirely differently. At the Washington Monument, you have a lot of folks (A LOT of folks) going in and out of a relatively small, enclosed space. People, for the vast majority of time, are outdoors in the Smokies."
Hatfield McCoy Dinner Theatre is closing as well. Talked to them this morning.
We just got back from calibered in it soon suck we do know have it
What are you trying say? Got back from what?
I got an email from vrbo saying that they are encouraging rental owners to work with their guests but nothing set in stone
We have been thinking the same thing my granddaughters have been nervous with one being from Michigan and one from Wisconsin and their schools being closed. We are going to go and hope for the best! Hope you have a great trip and we get to enjoy as much as possible
We are going ahead with our plans for spring break. We got a very nice cabin with a fishing pond so even if we decide not to hit local attractions we will have a nice vacation. I was already planning on cooking two meals a day anyway so now it will be three.
My family plans on taking a trip spring break to Gatlinburg we've already paid for it and I'm just praying and that's all we can do
We are heading there tomorrow. We arent changing our plans. There might not be anything open but dammit we will be there lol
"I live in Gatlinburg. Today (Saturday 3-14-20) Gatlinburg was packed with people. I personally watched thousands of people parade up and down the strip. Some were coughing, hacking and sneezing. If any one of them did have coronavirus it could easily be spread to alot of people and places just from todays contact alone. I saw kids on spring break, families taking advantage of schools being shut down because of this. Local kids running the strip because school is out. Elderly people everywhere. There is no way one could practice ""social distancing"" on those sidewalks full of people. The shops cannot possibly wipe down all the merchandise casually handled by all the customers today. Our Governor has declared a state of emergency. Canceled all events and gatherings of 250 people or more. Yet today the strip had thousands of people walking together in mass crowds. Sorry guys but if the USA is basically on lock down and you are only concerned about your weekend getaway......"
From Muskegon area. Leaving Tuesday through Sunday. Enjoy
I'm still going this week. I'll be leaving tomorrow gonna take in the beautiful mountain. The country isn't on lockdown if we were wouldn't be allowed out the house. Why live in fear. I get it if ur older or have a low immune system. Then you should stay home. Life is too short to stay locked up. Basic precautions which should be done anyways. If I have to come back early then so be it but at least I'll get to enjoy sometime away. That doesnt come easy for some people.
I contacted the property manager for my VRBO rental and they have changed nothing. I’m past the full refund and 50% if I cancel by Fri.
"Agree with Tabo. I live nearby and have a house in Gatlinburg. Regardless, NO ONE should be traveling right now. It is incredibly selfish to think only about your own immune system. Whatever this thing is, it’s not some kind of political or media made up malady. You can help slow the spread of this crap by staying at home for a couple of weeks. What might not affect your immune systems will affect your mamaw or papaw or someone else’s."
The country is on lockdown. Travel ban. No one in or out of the country. That does not mean cities or houses are on lockdown. However New Rochelle New York is a city on lockdown.
Tesbrik - exactly. My opinion is that Everyone should show some personal responsibility right now and stick closer to wherever “home” is. Let’s all contribute to nipping this thing in the bud by narrowing our exposure to contagions. The beautiful mountains and attractions will still be here.
"We are here in Gatlinburg now. We are in an isolated cabin enjoying the space and fresh air and have not gone downtown at all. We have all food and supplies, sanitizer and toilet paper you could ever ask for. Hell, we have had alot less contact with people since arriving here than on our hometown which is overrun with spring Breakers all from all over the world. Quit judging people for traveling to a remote cabin and acting responsibly. There's a difference between acting in fear or being smart but cautious."
"Tabo, with all due respect, the country isn't even close to being ""basically on lock down.""Tesbrik, yes, there is ""treatment."" That's why there is a high recovery rate for a majority of folks. As so many medical experts have stated time and time again since this started, it's the elderly and those with immune system issues that are at serious risk.Edited: 1:17 am, March 15, 2020 "
Reid...there is no treatment for coronavirus. Medical staff are helping treat symptoms as they occur. The main point of closing houses of worship and cancelling events is for social distancing. This is so that there is not an enormous amount of cases that will inundate the hospitals. Hospitals can only handle so many cases due to lack of beds and equipment. Social distancing is (hopefully) going to spread out the cases so hospitals can handle those patients who need to be there.
"Folks, I have a second home in Knoxville so I am here for my daughter's spring break. We were hoping to have my sisters fly in and then go to an Airbnb near the national park. It is looking like we will cancel though. The issue isn't just that you may get sick, but people become carriers with no symptoms, sicken others unknowningly, and then the healthcare system gets swiftly overwhelmed as cases mount exponentially, healthcare workers become sick. We are currently following the pattern of Italy where people did not adhere to social distancing, and now the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse and doctors and nurses are dying, and the triage protocol has become treating only those with the best chance of recovery - if you get it and are in a high-risk age group you are basically left to die at home or in a hospital hallway. THIS IS BAD. Stay home for two weeks if at all possible. Flatten the curve, protect others."
"I tend to believe Janet W, as of yet, there is no cure or treatment for this virus....only quarantine, if found infested.Ray"
Dollywood has just released that they have postponed their opening date for at least 2 weeks. We are leaving on the 20th and I’ve been trying to see what all may be canceling or closing and just saw this about Dollywood and the Stampede
Are there any closing of attractions? I know Dollywood postponed their opening. We are coming 3/20
"So is the moonshine tasting, aquarium, and Go karts closed?"
"Mdunlap18, See Post 70 of this Thread. There’s a link to Pigeon Forge tourism, and they will keep it updated with closings (if it’s not listed, it’s open, most things still are open. I’ll post it here, too: https:/…travel-advisory ) and there is a link to a couple of News Stories how Sevier County is handling this issue, with the extra precautions businesses are taking."
"Thanks for sharing! Not only are they choosing in Italy which Coronavirus patients to put & save in the ICU, if you are already in the ICU for something else and a Coronavirus patient needs your bed, they have to establish if you or the Coronavirus patient is better candidate to survive. There's simply not enough equipment to treat everyone. I'm sure the doctors do not want this but what else can they do?"
"Please let us know which cabin refused to refund you, as we all need to make sure to avoid that business and push them out of business if they act like this. Thank you"
"I know that the coronavirus is a big reason for stopping vacations. I was planning to go to coco beach and had to cancel. Although I believe a cabin in Gatlinburg might be perfect for anyone wanting to travel. Distanced away from people in a secluded area surrounded by nature and lakes sounds perfect to me right now. I just hope there aren’t any cases in that area before the trip.Edited: 4:20 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Travel ban. American cities on lockdown or curfews established. Major tourist and sport and entertainment venues canceled. Schools and Universities closed. Dr. Fauci recommending everyone stay home. So just because everything may be ok where you are right now.....is it worth the risk? Not to me.
"For those that will be there this week, I would love to hear about it as well, we plan to leave next Sunday 3/22- We are a family of 4, traveling from Columbus Ohio headed to Pigeon Forge for 4 nights during our spring break. As or now, we are not cancelling! It's driveable for us, so no flights....same risk as if we stayed home! We were planning on Dollywood so that won't happen but we can still get a change of scenery, spend quality family time and hopefully get into some trails in fresh outdoor air! Avoiding crowded places, visitor centers and not going out to eat obviously....not sure WHY we would cancel? As long as we can get groceries down there, and i did see they have Walmarts, might do Walmart Grocery Pickup so you dont' even have to go into the store! no brainer! We are still going! What am I missing? Why would we cancel? unless some sort of domestic travel ban is placed but as of now we are looking forward to it!"
"Tabo- can you please post a link to any articles concerning a US city that is currently on ""lockdown""?"
"coastermeister,Dr. Fauci said this morning, “I mean, they've (domestic travel bans) been discussed, but not seriously discussed. I do not see that right now in the immediate future....”https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-sho…"
CRinTN- I'l well aware of that. Poster Tabo says American cities are on lockdown. I want to know where Tabo saw that information as it's something I am unaware of at this time. Curfews are not lockdowns or a ban on domestic travel. It is unwise to spread false information that could lead to additional panic in a time like this. I want to be enlightened if it is true.
Here's a link that may help calm most peoples fears-https://tinyurl.com/udnac33
We’re heading down this weekend. I’m more concerned about what’s going to be open when we get there. We’re just going to hike and (hopefully) get some good food.
There is no way I would go to any tourist trap any time soon.
I found this travel advisory helpful https:/…travel-advisory
Interested to know also
"My husband and I both in 60’s me with lung issues. Reserved a cabin way back in Nov for last week March. I’m not sure about going now, but date has been changed once already."
Companion...anyone with underlying health issues older than 60 should be staying at home as much as possible. The Smokies are not going anywhere. Perhaps an August vacation would be better...hopefully the crisis will be over by then.Stay well.
agreed
We are cancelling our Pigeon Forge condo rental. Losing half of our deposit. Just a matter of time before everything closes down there.
"Tesbrik, the concept of restaurants being takeout only has not been mandated nationwide at this point. There are fewer than 10 states doing that currently."

"We are not talking about a Walking Dead pandemic here. Normal, healthy people can get on with their lives with a few additional common sense practices. Social distancing, extra hand washing and avoiding contact with the elderly and weak is wise. Locking yourself in your home for 8 weeks is unnecessary and not part of the CDC guidelines. Common sense and following a few additional guidelines is all that is necessary. Stirring up additional panic is irresponsible. We already have enough unfounded panic going on."
"If you are coming down and planning on grocery shopping here, I would advise bring your own groceries. There is a Walmart and Kroger along with some others, but you might find empty shelves for some high demand products. We live here and drove through Gatlinburg last night. Still packed with early spring breakers. Shops all open and doing business as usual. Dollywood is planning a delayed opening, so you might want to check that. Tanger Outlet was jammed packed all weekend.We love our tourist crowds, but check before you come. Safe travels, and wash those hands. Cough in your elbow. Don't shake hands, but continue to wave. Enjoy your time here and tip the wait staff heavily, they depend on you for their income."
"We are reconsidering going. Restaurants are shutting down in many states. We contacted the resort this morning and they say they are open. We Can't get a refund, csn only rebook for up to a year. We will probably cancel. Our resort usnt very understanding."
"I have a mid-April reservation in a fairly remote cabin. My main plans are to do a lot of hiking and to generally avoid people.I've been trying to find information to determine if it is possible that access to any of the more popular hikes in the area, such as Rainbow Falls or Laurel Falls trails, would be denied due to a closure of some type.I've read that visitor's centers will likely be closed, but other than a travel ban from state-to-state, what would prevent me from driving the the entrance of a trail and simply hiking on my own? I know that there are park rangers that are typically around on these trails, so my concern is that if the rangers aren't working for some reason, road access to the trails could be closed.Edited: 12:56 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Copied the following...The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina, park officials were taking a number of measures to reduce the threat of coronavirus in the park.

You can rest assured that Dollywood will do everything possible to make sure their guests are safe! And might I add at any expense. They understand that people will still travel.
"Here is a statement about the Dolly-related shows from https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Theaters-an…“...The Comedy Barn Theater, Dolly Parton’s Stampede, Hatfield and McCoy Dinner Feud, Pirates Voyage, and Smoky Mountain Opry will be closed until May 9th.World Choice Investments CEO Jim Rule said ""We have been following the coronavirus crisis very closely and based on the new guidelines provided by the CDC yesterday and in consultation with the health experts, we are closing all of our theater facilities until May 9,”The team at World Choice Investments will meet with the cast members at each facility this week.

Any additional changes will be released at a later time should they occur.For guests with tickets for this period of temporary closure, please contact 865.453.4400 for rescheduling information.“"
Just watch the Knoxville News a few moments ago and Dollywood is closed Hatfield & McCoy Dinner Show is closed Comedy Barn is closed at Dixie Stampede is closed with more to come
"It's the best social distancing vacation out there. You drive in a car to a private cabin with keyless checkin. You are in the mountains with hikes and drives, food delivery and a kitchen. This is a great way to get away and stay safe at the same time."
"Barry A, I've not seen anything about any closures for the national park. Barring any changes in that, you should be fine for national park access. Access to both Rainbow Falls and Laurel Falls trailheads is currently open.If for some reason the National Park Service were to shut down and rangers, etc., weren't working, I would anticipate U.S. 441/Newfound Gap Road to remain open but all other roads to be closed (and that would include access to Rainbow Falls and Laurel Falls).Edited: 10:00 pm, March 16, 2020 "

I'm leaving from ky to Gatlinburg tn march 26th hope I dont have to cancel and attractions are still open there in pigeon forge
"My husband and I planned to visit at the end of the month. We live in Ohio. All of our schools are closed for the next 3 weeks, maybe till end of school year, all restaurants, movie theaters, bars, healthclubs are closed until further notice. Our voting for the primary, just got cancelled. This is real people. Anyway, I cancelled our trip today. There are hundreds of people walking the streets of Gatlinburg. Not worth bringing this virus to you or back to Ohio. My husband and daughter are both nurses in a large hospital. I am well informed on how serious this is. People need to stay home, just for a few weeks. If not, my God protect us all."
"Thank you! People just dont get it. I hope they know, our healthcare system can NOT handle every sick person that walks through the ER. But hey, they got their vacation! Selfish people."
Looks like quite a bit is closing. Would only expect it to increase.

I don't think people get that this needs people to spread it. That's why avoiding people will help decrease the problems other places have had with deciding who gets treated and who doesn't.
The mother of my daughters is insisting on travelling to Gatliburg this weekend. I'm trying to get an emergency restraining order against her to prevent this. She is a nurse and should know better. Yet she chooses to be blatantly reckless and selfish. I hope she doesn't spread it to your wonderful community.
Tom...I would point out that many things are closing. Perhaps she will finally get to your way of looking at things. Sevier County had their first reported case. The cases in TN are really rising quickly. I was surprised when I saw the number.
"Tesbrik- are you implying that there are now different mutated forms of this virus? From everything I have read and understand, infection is the same regardless of the carrier. Your bodies response and ability to fight off the virus is the difference. If otherwise please explain."
"I read quite awhile ago that the virus had mutated. There is a ""S"" and ""L"" strain but other than that, I have no knowledge how they affect people differently. Viruses mutate all the time...I just wish it mutated to a less virulent form!"
"I plan to go @ the end of this month. It has crossed my mind to cancel but kinda didn’t wanna let this thing scare me even though it’s a bad situation. I’ve spoken with the cabin manager and apparently besides a few big attractions, people are still down there renting cabins as well as enjoying things they can do. Prayer is the key to this all and I really pray it ends soon!"
"You might want to check on attractions, etc that you might be planning on doing, as a lot of them are now closing. We were there this past weekend and it was VERY crowded!! If anyone there had the virus, it’s definitely spread to a lot of people! There was way too many people walking very closely together. We tried to keep as much distance as we could, but it was so crowded that was impossible. Changes do need to happen there to protect the elderly and with chronic health conditions. I have asthma so I have to be careful!"
"Any sane person would cancel their trip to a crowded destination like Gatlinburg. Reschedule for later in the year, this is a very unwise time to go.Tennessee has done a very poor job of preparing for this event, and Gatlinburg is even worse. Sticking your head in the sand like an ostrich won't help anyone and will get more people sick faster. Especially the older more vulnerable population that visits this town."
"We own a shop in Gatlinburg and don’t understand why people aren’t taking this seriously. People have more chance for exposure in a tourist Mecca than staying at home. We figured on being shut down for a couple weeks and maybe getting ahead of this. As is, we maybe just making thing worse."
"Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge are packed, which is complete STUPIDITY! People from across the US are pouring in since the kids are out of school but the kids are out of school to keep them away from people so they dont get sick. And people packing them up and putting their children in danger is complete idiocy. I seriously dont understand. At the same time, they're putting EVERYONE in the vacation industry in jeopardy. Im sorry but its a very selfish thing to do."
I just cancelled my reservations that I made in Nov. I booked a cabin with Smokey Mtn Falls property mgt through VRBO. My date to cancel with full refund was March 5th. All this with COVID-19 blew up after that date. Smokey Mtn falls will only refund 50% and VRBO refunds none of their “fees”. I’m losing $514 because of something completely out of my control. The states and US government is recommending no non-essential travel. I can’t believe that they are not giving full refunds in these extraordinary circumstances that none of us have ever experienced in our lifetime.
Everything is or has shut down. I live here and would say cancel unfortunately.
Are the cabin rental companies shutting down? My daughters mom is hell bent on taking them there this weekend and I can’t convince her to cancel. Shutting down is my only hope.
"If the cabin companies stay open despite the official guidance to avoid discretionary travel, I think there will be a legal basis for lawsuit on the grounds of negligence. Honestly who stays in a cabin for mission critical travel assignments? This needs to be halted immediately."
How can they gaurantee that the cleaning crews arent themselves infected and thus doing more contamination than cleaning? They can't. This whole thing smells of profiteering off of a national emergency.DO THE RIGHT THING AND SHUT DOWN NOW! JUST FOR 15 DAYS and we can all be be back to 100% very quickly!
"Some are wondering why people continue to come to Gatlinburg in this situation. It's because the cabin rental companies refuse to issue refunds, unlike every other major hotel chain in the U.S. So long as cabin rental companies refuse to issue refunds, despite the national emergency, people will continue to come to Gatlinburg. The profiteering of the cabin rental companies is inviting the spread of COVID-19.Edited: 11:19 pm, March 17, 2020 "
At some point in time though you've got to set your priorities. Money or putting your family in danger. I'd be seriously questioning someone that chose money.
"Romulus, I don't think it's entirely a lack of possible refunds. I think some people believe going to a cabin and staying there for vacation isn't dangerous. They aren't going to town, they aren't walking up and down the Parkway, and they aren't packing in to any of the attractions."
"Thanks ReidAdair, that’s exactly my point as well.If my travel plans are to drive directly to a cabin in the mountains (bringing everything I’ll need with me) check in with a keypad, and the only activities I’m doing are hiking and relaxing at the cabin, then I don’t see how I’m at risk or putting anyone else at risk. I’ll still be practicing social distancing; probably more than if I had stayed home.Edited: 7:48 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Agree with both of these posts. If you plan to spend most of your time in a cabin with people you would be with anyway and/or outside away from people, why cancel? IF THE PARK IS OPEN, which, to my knowledge, it is, then what's the problem with people actually using it?"
Most of the attractions are closed
"The visitor centers in the park are closed but I understand that the restrooms are currently open. I am not sure how often they will restock though. Personally, I would cancel. The government is almost begging people to stay at home and limit travel."
"The visitor centers in the park are closed but I understand that the restrooms are currently open. I am not sure how often they will restock though. Personally, I would cancel.

"FYI You can still order things from your favorite shops in the area and still be able to support the local businesses. I just ordered some coffee.Here is a few places that accepts mail orders: Coffee and Company, Apple Barn and Cider Mill, All Sauced Up. Ole Smoky Moonshine and many more.Edited: 12:43 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Just an update; since I originally posted this, the world has changed significantly (in just a week!) - so we have officially canceled our trip. Airbnb is now offering full refunds for those of you using them :). I am sad, and will miss seeing those gorgeous spring blooms, but now it is very clear it’s really the only decision for us. Thank you all for your responses and discussion! Next topic: when is a good time to come in the fall, because we will be back, you can count on it! XoxoEdited: 12:46 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Posted this on another thread too, but the Skybridge is now closed.(WCYB) — Operations are suspended until further notice at Gatlinburg Skylift Park and SkyBridge amid concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic."
"We have made the decision to go this weekend - my co-worker has a cabin off of King's Branch Rd which is secluded - 100 yards to the next closest cabin, which we've never seen anyone at.We will bring our provisions, but will also try to get to a couple of local places for carry out or dine-in if they are practicing good social distancing protocols.We plan to enjoy the scenery from Foothills Parkway, Cades Cove, Fontana Dam, Newfound Gap and anywhere else the road may leave. If we pass a trailhead with only a few cars, we'll stop for a short hike.Mainly, we're going to get away from the gloom and doom all over the airwaves (not saying it's warranted or not) and to connect with nature and being together as a couple.Heading up mid-day Friday and coming back mid-day Monday. It will be a different trip from normal, which typically includes a day at Dollywood and a day doing the ""tourist stuff"" in Gatlinburg."
"Patrick K, sounds like a safe and enjoyable plan. Have a wonderful trip."
The attractions are closed along with a great amount of restaurants unless they can do take out— not sure about the motels
The only attractions confirmed closed at this point are the Ripley's attractions (including the aquarium) and Gatlinburg Skylift/Skybridge.No restaurants have been confirmed closed on any lists for the area I have seen.
"As its getting close to the day my family and I leave, attractions are closing, We leave Friday and we are packing but kinda optimistic about it cuz it wont be a whole lotta fun if u have to stay inside, plus it's raining most of weekend"
"Then you would be better off at home. At least then you wouldn't have to touch Gas pump handles and surfaces that have likely been been only part cleaned. The fact that these cabins are staying open is only going to hurt buisness for a much longer duration than need be, and you are contributing to it."

"We also have a trip on april 30th, we're from Detroit MI.I've been keeping up with the updates and as of now we are still going to the cabins. They are saying the cabins are still open and some restaurants are closed. Dollywood is scheduled to open march 28th via their website. So fingers crossed our vacation isn't ruined"
"Same here, hopefully by mid april this will kinda calm down some. Fingers crossed"
I doubt the coronavirus will even peak by mid-April but I hope I am wrong.
Hello. I was a little concerned at first too with the restaurants closing the dinner halls and stores running out of products. But I think we're going to just go ahead and go because who knows when this will clear up or how much worse it's going to get. The cabin rentals don't refund your money just reschedule your dates.
"Do not head down here! There is no such thing as ""social distancing"" in this area, and while you may think you're healthy, no one can say for sure that you are not an inadvertent carrier of the virus. Main attractions such as the dinner shows (like Stampede and Hatfield & McCoy) are shut down until May. Restaurants are changing over to carry out and delivery only if they remain open."
"My childrens' mother who is a nurse is coming there tomorrow. There is nothing I can do to stop her, Shis coming from Madison County AL which has confirmed cases and she herself has been coughing latley. I was praying the cabin companies would just shut down for two weeks at least. Now were going to be looking at months of shutdowns and lost revenue."
"Well Barry from Omaha post #180 - so no harm because you're bringing everything with you right? So you don't plan on having to buy any gas anywhere, use a public restroom, look through any attraction brochures, or buy any short shelf life items like milk or bread during your stay? Definitely no way you could pick up a germ or two along the way..."

I can totally understand my trip is next week and I’ve almost been scared enough to cancel because of other things canceling. I’m gonna call to check today to some actual spots up there because I know some attractions have closed.
"Bitterrootwoman, my planning will prevent me from needing nearly all of those services.I admit, yes, I will likely have to stop at a gas station somewhere along the way, but I don't see how refueling at the pump while travelling would be any higher of a risk than doing so while not travelling, as long as I follow all of the correct precautions, which I do."
"Barry, carry along some gloves or some alcohol wipes to clean the pump handles. That solves the gas-pump concern."
Ole Red in Gatlinburg has officially closed until further notice. Just got the email from them.
"GoldRushJunkie, it will be interesting to see if that starts any follow-up. That's the first major restaurant to close in Gatlinburg, as far as I can determine from various websites."
How has your trip been in TN?
"I am currently in Sevierville now; arrived on 3/15/20 for a week vacation. We are staying in a rental cottage. This is our 1st trip but we are travelling with another family who have vacationed here a few times in the past.Tourist traffic is definitely way down. I estimate 60% - 70% drop off in tourism. This is based on our friends comments and feedback from locals. A lot of shops/attractions are shutting down. Some restaurants are moving to pick-up or delivery only. Other businesses are doing their best to follow CDC guidelines and still remain open.Most of the high demand items in the grocery stores are out of stock (hand sanitizer, TP, paper towels, pasta, rice, etc.) But there is still plenty of food and water. There are no long lines and everyone is really nice to each other. We went to Gatlinburg once and found it difficult to adhere to the social distancing guideline. The area is very compact. We felt the most people crowded here. Pigeonforge is much more spread out and there were very little clusters of people. This is where we visited most when we went into town. Mostof our time has been spent either in the cottage or out in nature with no one else around. I am not going to recommend either way if you should come or cancel your trip. We went to get away from the boob tube and non-stop 24/7 deluge of news on the virus. It truly is beautiful here in the Smokey Mountains. A natural antidote to the stressful times in our midst. Many of the business owner have gone out of their way to thank us and show us their appreciation for visiting and spending our money. A lady that runs a bakery told us she lost 11 wedding cake orders in the past week which amounted to $10,000 loss. She put a table in front of the counter to keep the distance 6 ft. or more between customer and cashier. Plus a large bottle of hand sanitizer for customers. This is what some shop owners are doing to stay in business.I really hope these folks are able to save their livelihoods and continue on. Take care everyone!"
"@Tonestar thanks for the info,we're traveling down there april 30th so hopefully it will have some normalcy by then. We're renting a cabin so staying in will be find. Just have to take extra Precautions along the way."
"I spent the entire month of February 2020 in Gatlinburg, as I did back in 2019, and then headed down to Daytona Beach for what was supposed to be all of March. I cancelled the rest of my Florida trip on the 18, and drove home to Michigan, arriving on the 20th. Many folks were heading North, and many restaurants and even some rest stops were closed. Places that I stayed on the way home were not offering any lobby breakfasts. Have you ever been to Gatlinburg before? If it were me, and given how much of a party atmosphere it is there, I would cancel my trip. On the weekends the sidewalks are wall to wall people, and so are many of the stores and attractions. I cannot imagine how anyone could do social distancing there. This now may be a moot reply to your question, but I wanted to respond just in case.Edited: 1:37 pm, March 21, 2020 "
Stay home is only sensible thing. Any travels cause spread of this virus. This is worldwide. We must all do our part and stay home!
"The mayor of Gatlinburg wants residents to self quarantinehttps:/…The national park has closed the campgrounds, Visitor Centers and restrooms.STAY HOME"
"For those who were going to be isolated in a cabin and perhaps do some hiking, the entire national park is closed from noon today (Tuesday, March 24) until April 6:""All areas of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, excluding the Foothills Parkway and the Spur, will close today at noon through Monday, April 6, 2020 to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

Janet I completely agree. If people would follow the trends they would understand the severity of this virus. NYC is a prime example. And now residents up North are traveling down to leave the city. It’s just a matter of time before all that’s north spreads down south. Please be safe everyone.
"Annette...I do not know where you are travelling from but you are not going to find much to do.https:/…You should reschedule for a later date. Now is not the time to travel. More and more states are seeing huge spikes in cases and putting ""stay at home"" policy in place. You have to consider the people who clean the cabins as well as residents of the area. If you were to get sick, being in familiar surroundings would be much better. Whatever you decide, stay safe."
"That’s exactly what happened here. We are near the beaches and all the out of state people came and were piling on the beaches, boardwalk etc. They had to close the beaches to everyone to put an end to it. It’s so frustrating to those of us that live here. The stores also stock less in the off season so it has left our stores totally depleted and struggling to get back in stock."
We're here 3-30 to 4-4 It looks like a ghost town. We are just going for rides and staying at our cabin. Hate they shut down Cades cove wish they could have left it open for driving only .
"Unfortunately, they don't have the manpower to enforce ""driving only"" throughout Cades Cove or any area of the park."
"It is really odd reading these stories, and not just about Gatlinburg but other places. I don't travel as much as I wish I could, but when I do it is such an enjoyment. I get that people who couldn't get their money back would rather get something, even if it is just hanging out in a nice cabin, driving around the mountains.I suspect that once the hospitals in the major metro areas are packed with the equipment they need to deal with the waves of sick people, we can look at easing some restrictions. For national parks, this might mean a long closures of facilities. It could also mean actions like blocking off every other parking space at trailhead parking areas, strictly enforcing overflow street side parking, or maybe even just installing entry/exit gates to limit the number of vehicles in at one time.Tens of thousands of people in a park the size of GSMNP is vastly different than tens of thousands in a sporting arena or stadium, hanging out within the confines of a university campus, etc..One thing I've pondered is if this might be the start of a limitation/reservation system for the NPS. There have been constant complaints of overcrowding and lack of funding to deal with the crowds. This could very well be the thing to give serious consideration to limitations. I know Denali and Zion have had restrictions for years now. When we went to Glacier a few years back, they were having to shut down access at various entry points on the east side of the park. Just too many people trying to visit at the same time.Edited: 8:54 am, March 31, 2020 "
"It’s amazing to me how many people are still considering visiting the area considering the current state of emergency! Governor Lee should take note from the other government leaders and STOP the selfish and inconsiderate people who insist on “vacationing” so you don’t loose your money? Look at Governor DeSantis Of Florida and see what has happened because he refused to send the Spring Breakers home! Look at a map of where home was to these people and what has happened. THEY CAME HOME TO YOUR BACKYARD! They are getting sick. Think of how it is to explain that to the people who have to say good bye to their family members (that YOU infected) when they are carting them off to the hospital to die ALONE!!! ASK A NURSE how if feels when they have to call a survivor of a covid19 patient so that the dyeing patient can FaceTime them for their last goodbye!!! Stop trivializing the situation and stop and think about how self centered, greedy and narcissistic those of you are. Think about those OTHER people whose lives YOU are putting in danger with your lack of humanity. As a nurse, I see what you don’t EVERY DAY! Turn on the news ... look at the faces .... look at the death. IT’S real AND ... IT IS HAPPENING whether you want to believe it or not. Do not be the cause. STAY HOME!!! The mountains will be there, WE MAY NOT BE!"

Lherts...well said and stay safe.
Lherts very well said. I tried to explain the situation way before it became what it is today to help people understand the importance of staying home but my efforts got dismissed and one even posted that this isn’t a walking dead pandemic. I truly hope people are understanding the seriousness of it all and the importance of staying home.
No you're not.

Go Home Now
"CB, it would help to refer to a post number, if you're trying to respond to someone."
"BradMac, this thread has derailed so far off of anything even remotely close to Gatlinburg-related travel, I'm not sure even post numbers would help.All of this belongs on that generic ""coronavirus"" forum that TA created."
"We’re suppose to be driving out there in 3 weeks for our family vacation. It’s a 2 day drive. The cabin company we booked thru and prepaid with is refunding thru April 30. Since our trip is scheduled the first week in May, we’re in limbo. Honestly I’d like to cancel the whole thing but can’t until they (hopefully) extend the cancellation policy so we can get our money back. It’s all so stressful and sad."
"Given the recent projections from researchers at Vanderbilt, I fully expect the Tennessee shelter-in-place order to be extended. Of course, they will likely wait at least another 10 days or so before announcing that."
"The Governor today (Mon. April 13) extended the Stay-at-Home order, which was set to expire at 11:59 pm on 4/14 to 4/30 at 11:59 pm. He stated he is optimistic that the economy can begin to slowly reopen. There will be an ""Economic Recovery Group"" implemented to explore how to best formulate this plan."
"Dollywood Parks and Resorts are going into a temporary “hibernation mode” until a reopening date is clear. For more, see https://www.wbir.com/mobile/article/life/peo…"
"So those of you who live in TN, in y’all personal opinions, will the governor start to open up on May 1? Do y’all think the parks will open May 1? Only asking because as stated prior, we’re in limbo waiting & I hate the uncertainty. I told our children today, to plan as if we are going, but keep in mind we might not know until two days before. And of course to try and not be disappointed if we don’t."
"tmde, I saw the other day that Knoxville's mayor is putting together a proposal for some re-opening. It's going to have detailed restrictions and policies for restaurants and bars, as well as retail stores.I haven't seen anything regarding Tennessee statewide or Sevier County specifically."
"@tmde,For May 1, I wouldn't expect much to be reopened. For May 31, it depends entirely on what has happened in the intervening 30 days.I would be ready to go, with the expectation that something will come up to keep that from happening. That, to me is easier than not planning to go and then, at the last minute trying to get out the door on your way.From your description above, I think you are handling it correctly."
"Sorry if this has already been posted, but on this page you can track the number of cases county-by-county in TN. It is updated daily.https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov.html"
Thank you
"I personally would cancel. I recently cancelled my early May trip because most states have not even reached the peak. Once we do reach the peak, there will be a long period where there will be cases on the downside of the curve. People getting out too soon will cause more cases to develop and we will have to start this annoying process again. Stay home until you feel comfortable travelling. I could not enjoy a vacation if I had to worry every time some one coughed!"
"Janet W. We can’t cancel. My cabin was paid in full months ago and as of today, they’re only refunding stays up to April 30 & started taking reservations for May 1. So we’re waiting to see if they extend the shut down. The cabin co. will probably refund us if the gov. does, but if the gov. starts to open up things, I don’t think they will. We were scheduled to leave May 2, arriving May 3. It’s why I’m kind of going a bit crazy right now. But I have decided to just plan like we are going. Bringing cleaner & paper towels to clean everything while traveling & once there, plus hand sanitizer, & face masks. And if we can cancel & get our money back, we most likely will. Though I do feel bad for owners & other businesses, cause they’re losing so much money & most are small businesses."
"Re: post 237. I live in East TN. I do not expect the National Park to open on May 1, for a number of reasons, but particularly because it attracts so many from all over. We haven't hit our peak yet in East TN. Social distancing is working. The Knox COUNTY mayor has some short-sighted ideas about reopening things and it will be perilous (For example, our very crowded farmers market). The Knoxville City mayor will be more conservative and pragmatic in her approach. Gov. Lee is itching to open everything back up, but he is being pressured by mayors across the state to be conservative in his approach. I think at the last minute he will extend at least another 2 weeks. I hope I'm right."
"I would also add that, as a state, city & county mayors have been asked to submit proposed reopening strategies for their area to the Gov. All of this will be done in conjunction with local health departments, and will take time to process and roll out any kind of state wide policy re: businesses."
"Sevier County mayor Waters released this statement on 4/16:“While President Trump and Governor Lee are currently aiming for an early May reopening of businesses, Sevier County leaders have been working on a plan to restart the county economy. Business owners, economic development personnel and tourism leaders have been communicating for several weeks with the county mayor, city mayors and managers of Gburg, Sevierville, PF, and PC, to find a way to welcome visitors while keeping them and residents safe. We will send recommendations to the gov.’s office. On a current projection of early May reopening, it may not be feasible for all businesses to work under the same guidelines, or in the way they used to. A strategic plan will hopefully lead to a swift and safe, economic recovery.”"
"Still holding out a tiny bit of hope, that our trip to Blackberry Farm can still happen in Late May - but am also a realist, so if it is still too early, we just cancel everything, as we have done for 5 I’ll-fates trips, since Feb.Best of luck to all,Hunt"
"Hunt, Mayor Waters released another statement today, 4/18. Time will tell with more testing being done this weekend all over Tennessee (free and offered even to those without all of the symptoms under the former criteria). Here’s the statement:“The Department of Health reports that out of 640 COVID-19 tests in Sevier County, 24 were positive, and 23 patients have recovered. 1 person has died. There are no active cases at this time. Please continue to follow safety and health guidelines to help us slow the spread.”So very sad about the one life lost. Encouraging news that there are no known active cases in Sevier County right now."
"Hunt, I hope everything works out for your trip. I'm sorry to hear about all of the cancellations."
"I live up in the Bristol area. In regards to the free testing done this weekend, the governor said 11,000 people were tested state wide. 1299 of those were up in this area-don't know how many were done around Sevier co. When all these test results start coming in in the next few days, I'm afraid our positive cases are going to go way up. This will probably continue for the next few weeks and may delay many reopenings."
"Kentucky has just started doing more testing. They have had realky low numbers but after opening 4 testing sights, their cases jumped to almost 300 in one day's reporting. The thing about the test is that it can take time to get results depending on which test ia given. Also, if test are given too soon, it can come back negative when a couple days later and it would be positive. This is a very frustrating virus. I just hope that the current trials with the Ebola drug...I cannot spell it...will give us a good treatment as that would be a game changer. It would ease people's fears until a vaccine is available."
"Well, it is now official - trip cancelled.Blackberry Farm called, and said that while they plan on opening on May 14, this event has been cancelled. The thought of 150 folk, dining and wine tasting, even considering their rather expansive facilities, was too much to try and coordinate.At least we have two other visits on the schedule this year. I told them to just apply the credit to one of those.Now, hope that those come to pass, in late July, and early December.I knew that this was likely, so had primed myself for the disappointment.Everybody stay safe!Hunt"
"Hunt,So sorry about your cancellation. You have a great attitude.Regarding the weekend testing, 910 tests were performed in Sevier County over the course of 7 hours. Currently, there are 2 active cases, and as mentioned with the increased testing, time will tell. https:/…Governor Lee has just confirmed he will not extend the shelter-at-home order past April 30. Some businesses will begin a phased re-opening next week. https:/… We'll keep an eye posted on what Sevier County does.Edited: 4:32 pm, April 20, 2020 "
"The Governor also announced today that TN State Parks will reopen this Friday, April 24. Keep an eye on the news for further details. https://www.wbir.com/article/travel/tennesse…Edited: 5:01 pm, April 20, 2020 "
That’s great. Thanks for posting.
"#254,That sounds like great news!Hope that it all comes to pass, and that the cases are resolved with great outcomes!!Stay safe,Hunt"
"#253,We discussed, and at length, still going to BBF, regardless of the cancelled event.We have to fly into a connecting airport, between PHX and TYA. My wife, with a strong clinical, and healthcare management background, expressed her concerns. As she has at least one conference call with CDC per day, she made great points, so the whole trip is off. In matters, such as these, I rely on her expertise, and the best data, available each day.We’ll just have to make it happen, in the future.We are also thankful, that we have the flexibility, to make such changes, and I feel sorry for those, who cannot be as flexible, as we can.All the best, to each of us, and stay safe,Hunt"
"CRinTN, that's just 910 tests performed, correct? They've not gotten any of those results back if I read the article accurately. As far as Sevier County, I think we've seen that they're not going to do anything the state doesn't tell them to do (at least, that's how they proceeded with shutting down, etc.). I have heard businesses and restaurants are planning to be re-opening in Gatlinburg pending the new restrictions, safety guidelines, etc."
"ReidAdair,That’s correct. The total from yesterday (for tests with results) shows that prior to the weekend’s testing drive there were a total of 654 negative tests, and 26 positive, with 1 death and 23 recovered. The weekend’s results are expected within 72 hours or so after testing.Hunt,It sounds like your wife is connected to great sources of information. I know postponing must be disappointing but your attitude and flexibility are inspiring.Take care."
It seems many businesses in Pigeon Forge have announced they'll re-open on May 1 (per this article from WBIR -- https://www.wbir.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/most-of-pigeon-forge-plans-to-open-for-business-on-may-1/51-4f7cc26f-5b81-4119-91f4-bb7ddfa4ddff).Think that answers the Sevier County question.There's been no similar update regarding Gatlinburg businesses from what I've been able to search.
"We own a vacation home in a Gatlinburg resort, and usually are there a week out of each month. We don’t rent it out, so we are the only people who use it and I keep it very clean and sanitized. We want to come up to do some ‘social distancing’ hiking and enjoy the views and spring weather. We thought if we brought all of our food with us we could avoid the G’burg Food City and basically have no contact with others. So much has changed in the world since our last visit in the first week of March. I’m a retired critical care nurse and have never seen anything like this. We have lost two family members to this virus in the last 3 weeks. We feel a need to go to the mountains because that’s where we refresh our souls, but even with precautions I am nervous. I don’t feel safe anywhere anymore. We have ‘stay at home’ orders in Charleston so I’m not even sure if we are allowed to leave. Has anyone on this thread recently traveled to Gatlinburg? Would love to know how it went..."
"Leila_Creates,See the posts from tara in this Thread: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g55270…Edited: 8:08 am, April 26, 2020 "
"I’m here now in a private, non-rental home. The park is still closed so no hiking. We brought all of our food from home and haven’t had to go anywhere. But we live in Tennessee anyway so aren’t affected by and kind of travel orders."
Leila...are you required to self quarantine for 2 weeks after travelling outside the state?
Is Gatlinburg open?
"Rudy, you should peruse the Gatlinburg Forum for the many posts about what is open."
We are planning a vacation in Pigeon Forge in August. Will there be any restrictions at that time?
"Debbie G, there's no way to know for certain at this point. The Sevier County mask mandate technically expires on July 31. There's no way to know if that or other guidelines will be extended into August or not."
"Since this Thread has resurfaced, here are some links from the various Sevier County forums with helpful resources for those traveling soon:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g20533…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60842…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60842…Sites: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60842…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g20533…Hiking: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14303…Outdoor Dining: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g55270…Have a safe trip!Edited: 3:37 pm, July 20, 2020 "
