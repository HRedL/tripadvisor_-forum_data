We are due and still planning to fly next week We are able to self quarantine on return due to the nature of our jobs I feel it is as safe in the Algarve as it in the UK My fear is obviously travelling without insurance... I have been reading these threds constantly and haven’t heard of an insurance company which on further investigation sounded reliable However someone has mentioned Battleface this evening and I have just had a look and have been quoted £80+ for the week for two adults two children I am more than happy to pay this for some peace of mind Has anyone else took insurance from this company?
"On the face of it, it appears okay, you are covered for Covid-19 medical expenses. However the following is of slight concern ""This benefit does not include cover in relation to COVID-19 expenses for trip cancellations, curtailment of a holiday or lockdowns.""So should anything change that prevents you returning, you will be responsible for all expenses incurred.Edited: 1:59 pm, July 28, 2020 "
It would seem our RBS platinum bank account has the same cover ?
"As usual its all in the small print.Having to pay for accommodation because you have to self isolate for two weeks in your accommodation,, may or may not be covered.The same may apply to having to reschedule flights ."
"Yes we have just booked insurance with Battleface. They have very good reviewsWe have a house in Portugal and our flights were cheap as chips so we just wanted insurance to cover us should we have an accident or fall sick. Not worried about quarantine because can work from home (or the house in Portugal if it came to it).However, if we were going on a package holiday rather than to our own house, I wouldn’t be comfortable with the level of insurance I don’t think and therefore I probably wouldn’t go"
