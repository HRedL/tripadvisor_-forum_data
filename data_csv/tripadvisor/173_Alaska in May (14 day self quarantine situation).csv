"Hello wonderful people=)My husband and I are really hoping to travel from Florida to Alaska beginning of May. We know that there is mandatory 14 day self-quarantine order in effect there right now.Our plan is to rent an RV in anchorage and drive around (with Homer being our main destination) without going into any public places besides grocery store in Anchorage and obvious gas stations/dumping stations.Cruise America assured me that that is totally fine and i can claim my RV as place of self-quarantine in my declaration form. But i just wanted to make 100% sure that that is ok. If so, can we stay in Alaska for lets say 10 days? Or do we have to do full 14 day stay in order to be allowed back into the airport.Thank you for all of you answers and time! Hope everyone is staying safe and making the best of this unfortunate situation"
"At this time your idea won't work. You idea is not self-quaratining, You are attempting to have a trip/vacation. You are not attempting to minimize your impact/exposure to others and our communities. We are approaching some dates where things will be reevaluated; but, IMO, they won't change that significantly in the next week or two."
"""the State of Alaska, under its authority to protect the public health, is implementing advanced protocols to ensure all travelers arriving in Alaskaparticipate in 14 consecutive days of self-quarantine to begin immediately upon arrival, allowing for travel from an airport or portage to the designated quarantine location."" https://gov.alaska.gov/wp-content/uploads/si…""visitors are to report to their designated hotel or rented lodging to quarantine and that the state is monitoring where visitors in quarantine are staying through mandatory declaration forms at airports."" https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/State-mand…I do hope this is just a ""joke"" thread...."
I hope so to... otherwise I'm heading to Portugal (where I'm supposed to be vacationing right now)!!!
"yeah i apologize for not living in fear and pouring my money into your economyEdited: 8:08 pm, April 22, 2020 "
What about also apologising for not being concerned for potentially infecting others with your plan?

"Never mind the fact the Alaskan residents are not allowed to travel between communities, so what makes you think ""rent an RV in anchorage and drive around"" would be acceptable? And if you think it's all propaganda, I hope you never have a relative or loved on that has succumbed to this, or was deathly sick for weeks. Geez, talk about arrogance."
Honestly there is arrogance and a bit of disrespect on both sides. Too bad we can't all be respectful. The Alaska forum is deteriorating quickly unfortunately.
"Fti...you said it!My only contribution to this thread would be....that propaganda or the 50% that was mentioned above has killed 15,000 New Yorkers. Stay safe, where ever you are."
"From an email Great Alaskan Holidays is sending out:Q: Are quarantines still required? A: As of now the self-quarantine mandate is scheduled to end on May 19th. However, whether it's extended or not, we have been advised by the Mayor's Office that individuals who are not Alaska residents can self-quarantine in a rental motor home. And where better to be quarantined....hanging out in Alaska, with no one around, except the animals. Intrastate travel is now allowed throughout Alaska."
Someone in another forum reported that there has been a sudden influx of new posters from Florida and Georgia starting threads like this that devolve into an argument about the situation.I would guess they are trolls trying to stir up discord.
"I put in a call to our quarantine/covid-19 hotline, and will be interested in the answer. Once I get one, I’ll be happy to share. The information gal was taking an email from another person, emailing and asking about “RV quarantines”, so she is going to find out for us. Deb"
To the OP; You should look into Clippership RV rentals...
"I was advised to email the governor, and his team could better answer the question. I’m not going to, but if anyone else wants further clarification, that’s where to maybe get an answer. Deb"
"P.S. I was still curious, so I called GAH, and the information is accurate. Visitors from outside of Alaska are allowed to pick up their RV, and use it to quarantine. I asked for no further information. Deb"
"Deb, to clarify - they can use an RV to quarantine but they would have to have 14 days worth of food and fuel correct? Because my understanding is quarantine means NO outside contact or leaving your quarantine premises, be it your house or an RV. i.e. no restocking of groceries!"
For a quarantine (in AK) they have to have a physical address.
"Scott and Jessba....I didn’t get into any of those questions with GAH. I already got grilled about quarantines, by other TA members recently, and I’m not prepared to answer all sorts of visitor questions, perfectly accurately, about how to do all the loopholes, and “what exactly can I do or not do”, but I did want to know if GAH sent that email, and they did. I also wanted to know if the governor’s office allowed it, they said yes, and that it was allowable to use the RV to quarantine. I was told yes. I stopped there, and decided if one was going to do it, they can get all their answers. I’m glad I live in a state I am happy to be in and do not need to travel this year, or fir a long time. That’s the opinion I’m willing to share on this subject. Let’s put it this way....,I agree with both you Scott and Jessba, and hope all visitors have plans for delivery, cause quarantine means stay out of anywhere public, period. I have no idea if one has to have a physical address, but have no reason to doubt you Scott. I’m not interested in running down every little question for folks, unless I want the answer. I hope that came thru with my smile, and not sounding snippy. DebP.S. Yup, and how are they gonna get gas? Hmm....so many loopholes. Ugh.Edited: 6:51 pm, April 27, 2020 "
P.S. One also needs to make reservations for all campgrounds. Deb
"Sorry Deb, didn't mean to grill you! I very much appreciate how much effort you've already put into answering these questions (and so many others).Was trying to make a point about needing to be 100% contained within an RV if following some wild plan to quarantine within it. Leaving for groceries, gas, etc are off limits, period."
"Very informative site: https://covid19.alaska.gov/health-mandates/The reading is interesting, if not frequently confusing/unclear; but Mandate 10.1 (see below) covers visitors coming in from another state or country:The easy parts are:""Proceed directly from the airport to your designated quarantine location""- if you are renting an RV then you are likely going ""directly"" to the RV retail location; and I'll bet GAH does not want you staying in their office/store for 14 days""You may leave your designated quarantine location only for medical emergencies or to seek medical care.""- You will not be staying 14 days in the motorhome without leaving it... below...""Pursuant to the Governor’s declaration, the State of Alaska hereby orders the following. Upon arrival in any community in Alaska from another state or nation, you must:(1) Proceed directly from the airport to your designated quarantine location, which is the location identified and affirmed by you on the mandatory State of Alaska Travel Declaration Form. (i) If you are a resident, your designated quarantine location is your residence. (ii) If you are a visitor or worker, your designated quarantine location is your hotel room or rented lodging.(2) Remain in your designated quarantine location for a period of 14 days, or the duration of your stay in Alaska, whichever is shorter. (i) You may leave your designated quarantine location only for medical emergencies or to seek medical care. (ii) Do not visit any public spaces, including, but not limited to: pools, meetings rooms, fitness centers or restaurants. (iii) Do not allow visitors in or out of your designated quarantine location other than a physician, healthcare provider, or individual authorized to enter the designated quarantine location by Unified Command. (iv) Comply with all rules or protocols related to your quarantine as set forth by your hotel or rented lodging. (v) If you are required to self-quarantine and there are other individuals in your residence, hotel room, or rented lodging, you are required to comply with social distancing guidelines."""
"We've cancelled five planned trips so far this year to Alaska beginning with going to Nome in March for the day for the Iditarod -- an email and postings from the Iditarod saying PLEASE stay away and plus the visitor center and NPS visitor center were closed and more, we totally understood and just put the funds back into my wallet. The subsequent trips have been cancelled due to the 14 day quarantine STILL in effect and will be UNTIL MAY 19th at least for further evaluation. It is absolutely stupid to go sit and pay for a hotel room for 14 days ;-) We're hoping to go to SIT in June but that still remains iffy too. Alaska flights have been restructured additionally to which we couldn't do the changes. Thinking they could self-quarantine in a RV and travel around is being damn stupid and ignorant of any of the quarantines. If the people who posted this initial thread were not concerned about others how will they manage having to wear masks at the airport and on ALL flights? AK just semi-opened intrastate travel but it's still with mandates. Try searching for the important info when going from one state to another .... it's very easy to do. https://covid19.alaska.gov/reopen/"
"I had to cancel my trip (end of May).... I am planning two weeks of hiking (obviously safe for all). That said, I'm not about to take on a major trip with restrictions. Our flight was refunded and we'll look into it again in August. SEEMS you HAVE to sign a form stating 'where we elect to quarantine'. I believe, if we tell the truth, we'd ruin a hiking trip if we went in May."
"How do you plan to cross the border? The last I heard, the borders are closed to nonessential travel until the end of May. We own a home in Alaska and spend half of our year in Alaska and aren’t going up due to the quarantine!"
So no update on when they LIFT the Quarantine?
"As said previously, it will be announced by May 19th. No speculation on what will happen, but the current quarantine runs thru May 19. IOW....very shortly we should have updated news about the quarantine. Also, Denali National Park may have updated news by the end of the week too. DebEdited: 12:54 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"""I am planning two weeks of hiking (obviously safe for all).""Maybe the hiking would be safe but there is nothing safe about outsiders mingling with locals to get supplies to get to the hiking."
"Nothing ""safe"" about being exposed to other passengers on the planes and in the airports while getting to/from Alaska either...not to mention other people you might have been exposed to in your own circle of acquaintances. Keep in mind that somewhere between 50 and 75% of people who have COVID-19 show no symptoms while still being capable of unknowingly infecting others.According to this article: https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/michigan-re… , yesterday Michigan had 40 more deaths and 370 new cases of COVID-19, bringing total deaths for that state to 4787. Alaska has a total of 10 deaths so far for the entire pandemic. And yes, Alaska has a much smaller population, about 7.2% of Michigan, but do the maths....."
The Anchorage Daily News updates the COVID-19 statistics and maps for Alaska here: https:/…
Update posted two hours ago:https:/…
Looks like it's extended until June 2nd now -- https:/…
"Yep, extended until June 2 (Health Mandate 10): https://covid19.alaska.gov/health-mandates/Barring anything unexpected it looks like that might be the end of it. Of course, if after the mandate is lifted there are too many new cases.... But let's hope for the best!"
You only have to self quarantine for the duration of your trip or 14 days which ever is shorter. The Governors office told me this over the phone.
"Sue, if your trip is 14 days or less, how is that relevant. You are still ‘holed up’ in one physical address with no outside contact, for all your time here."
Grocery stores have personal shoppers who will bring your order to you in the parking lot.
Meeting in a parking lot is not quarantining.
"Just to give an ""official"" response to the original question about RV's while the quarantine is still in effect:Can I quarantine while traveling in an RV/camper?No. Mandate 10 requires you to submit a declaration of your quarantine destination, where you must remain for 14 days. You may not leave quarantine except for medical care – traveling in an RV or other vehicle would require stops to refuel, etc. and involve interactions with the public.Can I quarantine in an RV/camper in one place?If you are able to provide the address of your RV, and you stay in one location for 14 days without interacting with anyone or leaving your quarantine residence for any reason other than medical, you can complete quarantine in your RV.More traveler information: https:/…"
"Governor Dunleavy announced the state is lifting the quarantine for people who get tested within 72 hours of arriving. Stay tuned for a follow-up announcement from Anchorage Mayor Berkowitz who earlier signaled his next action would be dependent in part on in-airport testing, which will be offered.https:/…Edited: 10:14 pm, May 29, 2020 "
Here is the link to the actual press announcement for those who want to see it. The travel portion starts around 7:15 and continues through the end of the Q&A.https:/…
Was the ban lifted June 2nd?
Kinda. Read though the many threads on the topic and/or read the states page on covidhttps://covid19.alaska.gov/travelers/
"Healthymissb . . . ""Was the ban lifted 6/2?""ONLY if out-of-state visitors arrive with a negative PCR test result for COVID-19, obtained 72 hours prior to arrival in Alaska.There have been many posts here on Trip Advisor about the requirements."
Thumbs Up!
"How many have been successful in finding a clinic that will do rapid testing? Most will turn around in 3-5 days, but not in the 72 hour window required. We have been unable to find a clinic that will do rpid on non first responders. One lab offers the blood testing, but not molecular as required. Asking for a lab in the Tampa area, anyone know? Thanks"
"Use an at home kit, there are 4 companies they accept listed on the department website. Everlywell is the main one everyone uses I believe. Labcorp has a longer wait time"
"We looked into the Lab Corp one, an d was concerned about the turn time. Fortunatly, we found a place in Tampa that does molecular rapid testing. Results before you leave. We also need a test in Oct when we go to St Maartin. One week from today! Looking forward to returning to Alaska."
