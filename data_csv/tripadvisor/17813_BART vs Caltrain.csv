I want to get Fisherman's Wharf on a weekday. I'm flying into San Jose and will have a rental car but don't want to drive it into SF (I've heard parking is an arm and a leg).In looking through the forum I've seen recommendations for BART and for Caltrain. If I took Caltrain I'd leave from the Sunnyvale Station. If I took BART I guess Fremont?Suggestions or thoughts?
"What time of the day and what do you want to do? Honestly, driving in and parking might be easiest depending on what you want to do. Also, parking at the BART and CalTrain stations are not the easiest either.Where are you staying in San Jose?"
"well, where are you staying? It does not make sense to drive to catch either mode of transit unless you are staying in that area. Are you going for the day and want to get back to your Silicon Valley hotel at night? If you are staying in Sunnyvale, then take Caltrain. if you are staying in Fremont then take BARTIf this is to save money - you won't' save much if you take Caltrain vs driving in and parking for the day at FW if that is all you want to visit."
This is just a day trip into SF. I'm staying several days down south in the Monterey area but want to visit SF before heading down. Mainly want to visit the Wharf and Golden Gate park.I have 10am arriving flight on a Wednesday. Would there be ample parking on a Wednesday at FW? What is the cost to park there? Do I need to worry about my rental car being broken into (see a few threads about that)?
Ok so you are now not coming up from San Jose? And you will have a full trunk of luggage?10am Wed flight- you will get your car by 11:30 or 12p. No problems getting to FW or GG Park traffic wise. Expect to pay about $10 per hr to park near the Wharf (there are outdoor lots as well as a multiple story structure across from Pier 39) and the underground structure at GG Park. WHERE in Golden Gate Park do you want to visit?As to luggage... if you have a sedan.... Do not open the trunk once you park and leave NOTHING visible. Take all your valuables with you. (We talk our laptops and camera in our backpacks and passport if applicable in cases like this).
"My bad... cheaper to park in GG Park:http://goldengateparking.com/Open:7am-7pmThursdays: 7am-11pm and for special eventsHourly rate: $5.00 weekdays, $29.00 maximum$6.00 weekends, $33.00 maximumhttps:/â€¦The PIER 39 Garage is open 24-hours a day, seven days a week.$9/hour (maximum daily rate of $45). Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (10/6, 10/7, 10/8) $12/hour (maximum daily rate of $60). Rates are subject to change."
"Here is a parking app to sort out where to park for how much:https://spothero.com/san-francisco-parkingWe recently used it to park at the Hotel 2620 near FW for the day for $15. For Golden Gate Park, I'd park in the underground garage between the Academy of Sciences at the DeYoung Museum.As Chinita warns, just have everything in your trunk (luggage, jackets, everything) and don't ever open it between renting the car and your hotel arrival."
At GG park. I would park on the street in an open area instead of underground for free
"Belo - that may be feasible on the weekday. They just have to be careful with the luggage. We are usually there on the weekend so we don't even bother. We have to go 5 or 6 blocks south in the Sunset.Dan - if you want to try free parking, look along JFK Blvd or the street on the back side of the Cal Academy. I think named Nancy Pelosis Dr or something now. The parking spaces on JFK are weird. There is a bike lane close to the curb and the parking is away from the curb. We always hear parking enforcement there with their blow horn blaring, ""you are parking in the bike lane. Move over."" This shows what I mean: https://goo.gl/maps/fPQNxwyEpE92Edited: 2 years ago "
"""I would park on the street in an open area instead of underground for free""Why???"
"BART is on the East Bay side and Caltrain is on the Peninsula/South Bay side. Both Sunnyvale and Fremont have plenty of street parking but you need to watch the street signs for limited hour parking and street cleaning.Fremont has more street parking signs along with super wide intersects with flashing traffic cameras, thus it's easier to get tickets.I would suggest parking at a Caltrain station or in close proximity then take the train down to SF and vice versa."
"""I would park on the street in an open area instead of underground for free""I would be VERY careful about parking in Golden Gate Park, especially with the epidemic of individuals breaking into cars, thus the numerous broken glass throughout the park on JFK Drive."
I am more worried about people parking underground and not having their cars visible vs parking in the more crowded areas. Yes we have break-ins but if the car is parked in an isolated part of the park that chance increases
@Claire Do you have to use the app or will you get the same price if you just goto that location?
Dan D - those discount prices are usually prepaid or at least done ahead of time. That is a good price and I never see those when I think to use Spot Hero or a similar reservations program.
"I pay via the app -- that's why it's a bargain. In the case I mentioned, I booked it more than 24 hours ahead knowing we had to be down by FW to go to Angel Island."
