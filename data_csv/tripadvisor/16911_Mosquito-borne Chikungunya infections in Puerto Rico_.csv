Anyone hear any more news on this? The virus was epidemic over the summer.
"The transmission rate now is very low. It was an ""epidemic"" bc it was new to the area. Search the forum for our past advice."
"It is still a problem and still an epidemic. Use Raid Flying Insect spray (or similar) in your room. Use Off (or similar) with DEET. I contracted CHIKV back at the beginning of November. Had a couple really miserable days then. I still have joint pain in various parts of my body, and it's in different joints every day."
"Sure, fewer cases reported now than in the summer/fall, but it is still here (and all over the Caribbean). Dengue too.Just use insect repellent and don't worry."

"Beth, we were there for 6 days at the end of Oct. We used avon bug spray 3-4 times per day, got very few bites and no one got sick. The times I got bug bites, we were in the grassy area by El Morro. They may not even have been mosquito bites. Puerto Rico is a beautiful island with lots to see. Use the bug spray and then forget about it and enjoy the island."
"Not sure why my comment was considered inappropriate.I will repeat it again. The likelihood of getting chikunguya in PR is lower than getting the flu in Baltimore.Sure, bring and use repellent, but do not worry much about it."
"I agree- the flu is a more serious and more likely infection to get right now, anywhere you go.Take precautions and enjoy your vacation!"
There are about 175 known mosquito species in the US alone. I would not worry about a Puerto Rican mosquito too much! lol :)
"just back from condado--did not see, or hea,r or feel, one single mosquito.... just saying"
"ProArt, the virus vector is the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which is the common house mosquito, present in the US as well. Which is why there is chikunguya virus in the SE US as well."
I had heard that taking heavy doses of vitamin C can prevent it. I live here never got it but and always took a lot of C. But that is what I heard.Ellis Puerto Rico
"Urban legend.Vitamin C is good to prevent colds, but not taking it as a pill. As with any vitamins, it is better to get it by eating fruits and vegetables."
How Did you acquire the avon product? Are they not available only from a representative?
"just got back from Vieques, got bitten a few times so did my husband but no sickness. Go and enjoy!"
