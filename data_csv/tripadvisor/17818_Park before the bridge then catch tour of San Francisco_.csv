"We are traveling from Fortuna and by the time we get to the bay area we will only have a 1/2 day to catch some highlights of San Francisco before we start heading back north towards Santa Rosa. We'd like to catch a tour that takes us into the city to check out the most popular attractions. We want to avoid crossing the bridge due to the toll hassle and don't want to find parking in the city. Is there a place prior to crossing the bridge to park (inexpensively) and catch a tour that will take us to the city? We are traveling with a 11 and 13 year old so we'd like them to see the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and Lombard St. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
"If you are dead set against driving in, park in Sausalito and Uber into the city. With just 1/2 day that will be the more time effective way to see things. Some tours (HOHO and guided) go to Sausalito but they don't start there."
To M-SF's point. I guess you can hop on one of those city sightseeing tours in Sausalito and they will bring you back into the city I don't get why you would want to do that -- if you have a credit card and you know how to fill up a web form with that info and pay the money -- I don't understand what the hassle is in pre-paying toll for the GG bridge -- that makes you come up with this plan ?
"You could drive down to the north side of the Golden Gate Bridge and drive up to the viewpoints on Conzelman Road in the Marin Headlands to see the bridge and city behind it. Then, drive back to Sausalito and take the ferry into the city.Beware of heavy weekday commute traffic going back to Santa Rosa if you are doing this during the week. Leaving Sausalito after 6pm should get you on the highway after the peak rush hours. If this is a weekend, then you have to deal with the mid-day traffic in the Sausalito area and bridge overlooks. If it's a nice day, it can be very congested."
Thanks for all the suggestions. The Uber was a great suggestion but I’m getting the vibe that I should just drive into the city and parking shouldn’t be a problem. The GG bridge toll I’m not 100% familiar with how to handle that. I hear the car rental places like to up charge for a toll meter. Is it really that easy to pay the toll by credit card? I understand there are places you can pay cash but I don’t want to take the extra time to find one. We will be coming in the city around 12 or 1pm on a Thursday so the suggestion about the traffic heading back towards Santa Rosa after 6pm was good. I’m sure we’ll probably be in the city longer. Any good suggestions as to where we can spend the night that isn’t super expensive and has free parking for our rental?
"Here's where you would go to make a Golden Gate Bridge online toll payment -https:/…onetimepayment.shtmlIf you only have half-a-day, then it would be better to head straight into SF and park. Less time wasted that way."
"the top questions right side have info on where to stay with a car in SF -- lombard street motelsOne word of warning DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING visible in your car when it comes to bags, luggage, phones cameras etc. Breakins are an epidemic here"
