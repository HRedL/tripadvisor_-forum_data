Has anyone heard any updates about indoor dining returning? Waiting for that to return to A/C.
Only the Shadow knows.
Lol true that. Wouldn't mind a rum and coke while slotting away either...
"It won't happen very soon. Our Gov now says that it can't happen now because of the large private parities that were held last weekend. IMHO that doesn't make sense, but that's what he said. So, don't hold your breath."
"It won't happen soon because the Governor is on a power trip and rather destroy more businesses even though the death rate is nearly 0 now in NJ. I just wonder how long the casinos can sustain themselves without it. I have been waiting for a nice two days in a row with excellent weather (low humidity) to go, but just about every day this summer has been too hot, humid, or rainy. Next week we may see affects from the tropical storm, so that would make another week I won't go.Edited: 1:05 pm, July 31, 2020 "
Thanks all... Was hoping someone heard encouraging news...
Sad that on a travel forum a couple of posters feel the need to spew their political beliefs. That is not what this site is for!
">>the governor is on a power trip and rather destroy more businesses even though the death rate is nearly 0 now in NJ...<<dr mike, the death rate is 100% for the people who actually die. also, the death rate - which is different than the number of deaths - has remained relatively stable throughout this global health crisis. it's the number of CASES one must pay attention to... the number of deaths is always a predictable subset of that. and the number of people who are infected in new jersey or who die in new jersey doesn't tell the whole story. people visit an atlantic city casino, then go back home to their community and potentially infect others in other states.it's reprehensible to suggest that the governor of new jersey would ""rather destroy more businesses...""do you really believe that? and please tell us... he'd rather do that than what? if you use the word ""rather,"" you must contrast one choice with an alternative. so what is the alternative to destroying businesses?promoting the health and safety of new jersey residents? saving lives?well, yes, if you look at the alternatives, i guess he would ""rather destroy more businesses,"" even though i am sure... and so are you... that has never been his intention nor his goal.some people choose the wrong side of every issue. and some people like to promote false choices. it's not the economy OR public health.. those two things coexist. and you can't have one without the other. opening the casinos and opening the restaurants won't bring the economy back if people are afraid to leave their homes or if they get sick and die.>>sad that on a travel forum a couple of posters feel the need to spew their political beliefs. <<all political views are welcome and diverse opinions respected.casting aspersions with no basis in fact? not so much."
"UK, more people are dying from gun violence in both NYC and NJ compared to COVID right now. The death rate is low and the hospitalization rate (the other important number) has been decreasing for months in NJ. (FACTS) If you are still scared, stay home! Yes, I really do believe the Gov has an agenda to destroy the state's economy in order to beg for more federal aid. (my opinion) Uk, you already indicated on here you are too scared to go to AC until there is a vaccine. Therefore, why are you even on this forum? You have nothing to offer besides fear mongering.Edited: 1:05 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Weather permitting and with a bit of planning, you can enjoy some great dining in AC. As I’ve mentioned on other threads, Gordon Ramsay Steak at Harrah’s was all around wonderful. A friend of mine recently enjoyed her experience at Morton’s in Caesars and there’s another poster here (TIFFaNYandNJ) who has vlogged what appeared to be so,e great meals out. I say all this in acknowledgment that indoor dining may not resume for a while but, I wouldn’t let that solely deter me from going to AC. Now, if the no comped drinks, no indoor bars/entertainment, etc. bother you as well, that’s another story. :)Edited: 8:07 am, July 31, 2020 "
"We were in A/C the second week it opened. We did eat at Morton's... We just did not enjoy our experience. We were only able to get a very early reservation, we grabbed it, but not our usual dining time. We did not enjoy eating the rest of our meals in the room, or waiting on a very long line for a cup of coffee in A.M. I don't smoke, but my husband does, and his favorite machines were far from exit doors, so he played machines near the exits that he didn't enjoy in order to go out and have a smoke. When we go, we go for the overall experience, fine dining, gambling, etc... It just wasn't enjoyable. We just returned from 3 nights upstate NY at Turning Stone Casino/Resort. Indoor dining was allowed, and drinks on the casino floor were allowed if straws were used. Of course masks were required and it seemed everyone followed the rules. There were disinfecting wipes all over the casino, so you could grab a bunch and give a good cleaning to your machines before touching. Overall, being able to enjoy nice meals, a fabulous room and a comfortable gaming floor was great.. We just wish the place was closer to us. That's why I was hoping for some encouraging news of A/C allowing a little more in the way of normalcy... Oh well, will have to continue waitng."
">>more people are dying from gun violence in both NYC and NJ compared to COVID right now. The death rate is low and the hospitalization rate (the other important number) has been decreasing for months in NJ. (FACTS) If you are still scared, stay home!<<dr. mike, COVID-19 will rank among the top 10 leading causes of death in the united states by the end of the year and has already surpassed the annual number of deaths from diabetes, suicide, flu, alzheimer's and stroke, all of which make a regular appearance on the top ten list. i have no idea if your gun violence statistics are accurate, but even kids know that a gun is not a disease. apple... meet orange.hey, here's a fun fact: most suicides are gun deaths and suicides rank #10 on that top ten list and COVID-19 deaths far surpass the number of suicides.also, dr. mike, do you know the reason ""the hospitalization rate... has been decreasing for months in NJ?"" it's precisely because the governor got ahead of the situation and took proactive steps and enacted stringent protocols. remove them and watch the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths rise.>>you already indicated on here you are too scared to go to AC until there is a vaccine. therefore, why are you even on this forum? you have nothing to offer besides fear mongering.<<gosh, no, dr. mike. the only person who has repeatedly said that i was waiting for a vaccine or that i was a scaredy cat is... you. i'm honored that i am always on your mind. it's a little creepy, but it truly is an honor just to be thought of. *mwah*>>yes, I really do believe the Gov has an agenda to destroy the state's economy in order to beg for more federal aid. (my opinion)<<well, you're certainly entitled to your opinion. but the governor knows well that his state is among the largely blue states that give far more to the federal government than they get back in federal aid. so, you're asking the good people of the forum to believe that the governor is an idiot who would manipulate indoor dining and business reopening policy to get federal aid which has historically been a negative expectation game. it's possible, i suppose, but hardly likely.time to turn (for the umpteenth time) to robert heinlein's sage advice:""never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig.""Edited: 11:35 pm, July 31, 2020 "

"""The number of new cases per day has risen to about 550 this week compared to about 350 per day in late June.""So much for the snowflakes who'd claimed by allowing indoor dining, the number of new covid-19 cases would jump. As I'd originally stated, indoor dining is not to blame. Rather instead, the increase in cases is more probably due to the selfish folks who continue to get together &/or form large groups of parties who're primarily to blame.OP - I'm somewhat glad that Murphy decided not to allow indoor dining to reopen. Had he otherwise had done so, the snowflakes ""out there"" would've quickly jumped to the absurd conclusion that indoor dining would've been to blame for the number of rising new (NJ) cases. The restaurant business in NJ State cannot continue to operate &/or survive for much longer. The State needs to allow for the reopening of indoor dining, mandating that all restaurants strictly adhere to the social distancing measures &/or req. Strictly table dining service ONLY; no bar services whatsoever, no group gatherings, no celebrant partiers, no no other exceptions allowed!"
">>the death rate is low and the hospitalization rate (the other important number) has been decreasing for months in NJ (FACTS)<<that's from post # 9 in this thread.here are the actual ""FACTS""...concern grows in new Jersey after thousands of new coronavirus cases reported:https:/…NJ coronavirus transmission rate is highest in 3 months. ""alarms are going off,"" murphy warns:https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/07/coron…new jersey weighs rolling back reopening plans as covid cases spike:https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/s…where is the coronavirus in NJ.? latest update on cases in each county, town by town:https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/08/where…(atlantic city has 552 cases with 15 deaths reported, among the highest number of cases in the state)and that is why indoor dining is unlikely to resume for a good long while.Edited: 10:25 am, August 03, 2020 "
#15Why do facts matter
"UK, the majority of people who died from Covid had underlying conditions that contributed to it, and very likely would have sadly killed them anyway. There has also been numerous cases where people were listed as a ""Covid death"" yet died from something totally unrelated. These are facts. Another fact for you from the CDC, ""Most people exhibit mild symptoms and recover on their own"". For these reasons, the case numbers are far less important than the hospital rate and death rate. Baseball, you are correct. Indoor dining is not the problem. The problem is too many young teenagers are being careless and having very large house parties without masks, especially along the Jersey Shore. But, I have not heard of any specific incident in Atl City.UK, the entire Atlantic County has been averaging 25-30 new cases each day. I log into the state's website every day to get the breakdown of each county. NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUMBER YOU POSTED.Edited: 10:28 am, August 02, 2020 "

"yes too many dangers right now,people who smoke are used to gasping for a breath and cant tell when they have symptoms as they are the same they already have,risky people as they already aren't afraid of cancer."
Good point dr mike
"Uk, you DID post a number. You said ""(atlantic city has 552 cases with 15 deaths reported, among the highest number of cases in the state)""Are you referring to a cumulative total, because there was not 552 new cases and 15 deaths in Atlantic City this past week. In fact Atlantic County only saw 18 new cases yesterday. My news source is the NJ COVID dashboard in this instance. Yes, different news sources will tell you different things. In fact even the new case numbers mentioned by the Governor each day never match what google, Worldometer, or CDC posts. When I don't even see numbers matching among all these valid sources makes me question what's really going on. No, I am not getting my news from FOX or CNN. NJ only saw ONE day recently with a very high surge in new cases (699 on Friday). Again, other sources showed that number was far less. Either way, these past two days new cases were only half that. The Gov directly stated that this surge is mainly from house parties, nothing else. I have a strong feeling he will adjust some restrictions this week such as indoor event gathering capacities and on Air BnB rentals. I hope it doesn't directly affect Atlantic City, aside from their Air BnB rental industry. Since we are not hearing about any issues connected with Casinos, I'd like to think he won't screw with them anymore."

"and there have been many over the years who longed for the days when gambling-related topics in the atlantic city forum would be shut down and labeled ""non-travel related."" there is certainly room for healthy disagreement and a spirited debate, but saying that arguing about public health data that will determine whether restaurants are allowed to open in a popular tourist destination is NOT travel related is a bit of a stretch."
"""saying that arguing about public health data that will determine whether restaurants are allowed to open in a popular tourist destination is NOT travel related is a bit of a stretch.""There are so many grammar errors in your statement that I cannot understand what you are trying to say."
