"Hi. We’re supposed to be going to Mazatlán via Sunwing vacations, on March 13. Any cases in Mazatlán? I’m trying not to worry, just being cautious."
http://graphics.channelnewsasia.com/There is already a thread on this for the area you are traveling.

There are currently only 7 cases in all of Mexico with zero in Mazatlán. Let's keep it that way.
"A resident expat told me there were 4 confirmed cases in Mazatlan, can anyone verify?Edited: 8:07 pm, March 09, 2020 "
Nope. Haven't heard of even one. Yet.
If there were a few reported Covid-19 cases in the area would you still travel to Mazatlan Soda ?
"With the Cruise ship that departed tourists into Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan, and others having quite a few, I would suspect there is some there even if not ""confirmed"" yet. We just returned home yesterday. Theres no screening, or noticeable screening at MZT. I do not want to imply worry or fear - just point out that there was indeed a cruise ship with confirmed cases in mid-late Feb that visited."
"Today or tomorrows ship was cancelled (what I was told yesterday), but a couple scheduled for Thurs are still set to tentatively arrive. Seeing more people wearing masks now than last week, although it's tough to tell if some are wearing them for the dust on camaron sablo and Rapael Buelna, the entire ocean side lane of camaron sablo is ripped up being redone from old Valentino's to just before Marina El Cid, and Raphel Buelna is entirely torn up and being redone from Sorianna Mega out past/to Home Depot (it's complete from Valentino's to Soriannas)"
"There were 2 scheduled today. One was cancelled due to 'mechanical' issues, 1 was cancelled due to a crew member being transferred from the Diamond Princess WITHOUT having the test results back from their test so the ship was given a 'No Sail' order and held in port. Two WILL arrive tomorrow."

"FUBOB,  ""This is getting out of hand how long before no one is admitted to the states from any foreign country ?"" If banning travel from foreign countries will stop or curb the cases of corona virus entering the U S, more power to President Trump.  Keeping the citizens of the U S safe is his job. Stay calm & wash you hands Safe travels Life is good.Edited: 12:04 pm, March 12, 2020 "

"The ban applies for those coming into USA from approx. 26 Eurozone countries ( those with open border crossings as France Germany ). UK and Ireland are exempt. Citizens of USA coming in are exempt. And I understand the ban is in effect for 30 days. Then re-evaluated..Edited: 8:56 pm, March 12, 2020 "
