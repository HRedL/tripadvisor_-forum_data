"My US citizen friend lives in the UK and has a British kid there (with no USA passport). Said friend's parents are not doing well and she wants to travel to US to be there for them. While I have, of course, suggested that traveling right now is not a good idea, nonetheless, she wants to know: can her non-USA passport kid travel with her to the US during this time of travel restrictions. Any and all advice would be appreciated."
"I doubt it, child is not a US citizen and has no right of abode. The parent should call the US embassy for advice.Moreover she may not be able to find flights, if she does she may find herself staying int he US for a quite a while. Does she have medical insurance to cover her during a pandemic abroad?"
"No idea on your very valid question. I shall put it to her, as well as your other thoughts. Very grateful to you for weighing in. Thank you."
Details matter.Check the State Dept website.
Thank you all so much!

If a child has a US parent then they are US citizens - accidental Americans with all the “benefits” that incurs (taxes).
"Without a US passport they will need to apply for an ESTA, I doubt many of those are granted right now. Without one the child cannot board a flight. Yes, in theory, the child is a US citizen, but it is a bit more complex. For dual citizens the passport is really important when travelling"
"Another concern would Be, does she have medical insurance cover for USA. If she doesn’t and falls ill, bills could bankrupt her.Many of us face similar situations and are advised not to visit the elderly, vulnerable etc. So travelling to US doesn’t seem a good idea. She could take the virus with her, she should self isolate for 14 days before visiting them. These uncertain times bring such difficult decisions."
So many smart and useful points. I've sent her this link and she has made the difficult decision to not go. Ever grateful to you all. Be safe...
"Wise choice, I also live 3000km from my elderly parents, I am concerned about them, but I also recognise a visit could kill them. SO there is facetime, and trying to find help for them in their community."
