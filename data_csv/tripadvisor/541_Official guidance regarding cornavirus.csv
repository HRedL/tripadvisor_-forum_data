"Hi, we are due to travel to Japan in 18 days. Visiting Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima. Planned for a long time and really keen to go but disappointed that British Embassy in Japan do not give clear facts on risks - such as cases diagnosed, in quarantine or self quarantining ..... we are reading everything we can to try to get a balanced view as very much want to visit but concerned we do not have full picture. Has anyone travelling had any information directly from FCO or British Embassy about exactly how Japanese Hospitals are coping? Before the fiasco with the cruise ship failures and Japanese government letting people in without testing etc and again letting passengers disembark without quarantine/testing I felt confident Japan was safe but now not so confident and as no reassurance being offered from British Embassy FCO, Japanese Government or our Travel Agents who are worldwide and probably one of the largest. The potential for overwhelming cases at Japanese hospitals as the ‘ex cruise ship passengers’ now at home in Japan start to develop and spread cases is very worrying. I am sorry to sound alarmist I just want to be realistic and have full facts before we leave UK for what is a big trip for us."
The failures will continue unfortunately. Now it’s time to keep the official numbers down and hide the truths.
"Since your trip is in only 18 days, I would not expect the situation to become much worse. Keep in mind that it took 2 whole months for things to become a little bit bad and the Japanese government is taking additional safety measures despite their failure with the Diamond Princess.At the moment this virus is less of a threat than influenza in Japan."

"Japanese government has the best strategy for keeping the number of COVID-19 positive patients low. That is not to test many people. I hear that Japan is testing only ~60people/day, no wonder they discover only a handful of new cases/day. Korea on the other hand, started to test all 210,000 church members where many infected people belong.It's hard to believe places like Osaka and Kyoto where millions of Chinese have been only have a very few infected people. I just don't trust those numbers are accurate at all."
"Dr Shibuyakko and kobekeith, thanks for your posts. So, in your opinion, is it best to avoid travel to Japan in late March even if things start getting better (on paper) in the next few weeks?"
"I'd follow the CDC guideline:https:/…coronavirus-japan*Older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel.*I suppose the chance of your getting infected by COVID-19 in Japan is lower than getting the flu in the US. The mobility and mortality rates in the young and healthy are super low as well. You still have about a month, so no need to decide now. Just observe and see."
I would wait too. See if a global pandemic is declared. I can’t say now that I think you should cancel for the end of March just because of the coverups and failures of the authorities.
"As per the CDC guideline linked above, how old is “older” in people with no pre-existing conditions? But like influenza, some fatalities have been reported to occur in young, fit people, albeit less commonly than elderly.For example the young Chinese ophthalmologist."
"COVID-19 death rate by age group:https:/…Note that the date is not conclusive as it's ongoing, but you get the idea. Influenza (see mortality rate Table 2):https:/…2018-2019.htmlAs you can see, influenza kills more young people. Of course COVID-19 kills young and healthy too but the number is very low."
"Thanks Dr Shibuyakko and kobekeith for your opinion. Very helpful!Edited: 5:03 am, February 27, 2020 "
"You’re welcome... Well, allegedly all schools in Japan will be closed until April now. https:/…101000cEdited: 6:25 am, February 27, 2020 "
Anyone know if onsens in hotels such as the Dormy Inn chain are still open with the Covid-19 virus?
"The figures in the links in #10 post roughly match those I mentioned on 7 February in another post thread #130 here https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29… The cases and death figures back then for those above 60 years are very close to today’s case and death figures. 90% of death rates are based on those occurring in Hubei province China with specific health disadvantage factors like insufficient critical health care at the time and perhaps factors like twice the average number of smokers in China vs other countries. So one positive in deciding to travel is that in general one might have about twice the survival rate of the low percentage death rate if not treated in Hubei and are healthier than that population set. If you are under age 50-60 years and healthy the survival rates are much higher, for example 1 in 200 chance of death if remotely infected.The main point based on the figures both now and stated previously on 7 February posts is that if one is 60 years old or approaching that (50 years +) and suffer from those pre existing health issues the chances of death if one is remotely infected are about 14% or 1 in 6 chance, which is too risky for travel to significantly infected countries (China and parts of Korea at the moment), Japan is not one if the figures are correct.There are many other factors involved.Edited: 8:44 am, February 27, 2020 "
"I am in the same situation as Traveller500 south.I feel extremely frustrated that we are not getting a clear picture of what is happening in Japan. If they are choosing to only test a small amount of people it is obviously only going to keep positive results low, hiding the true extent of the problem. The vast increase in cases in Italy Iran and South Korea only go to show that it must be happening in Japan as well.The WHO and FCO do not seem to want to look any further than these results to base their opinion as to whether it is safe to travel.My tour company is therefore, as far as I can tell, basing their decisions on false information and do not really seem interested in passenger comfort or safety. I would imagine that our tour may end up being rather different from the one booked .At the moment there seems no point in cancelling , just in case the truth of the situation does get out and the FCo change their travel advice."
"Monsoon, it’s true. So many coverups and lies just in order to make as much money as possible off of you before everything comes out. It’s disgraceful."
"I see from CDC website, advice for US travellers is if elderly (not sure what is defined as elderly) but they are advising against non essential travel to Japan. We are still booked to fly out from London Heathrow in 15/3 but unless FCO make some clear advice we can’t cancel and claim on insurance..... just wondering if now CDC has now raised its advice level for seniors if UK FCO will do similar?"
"I am a long-term expat here in japan, like many others on this board, and live in Tokyo. I have been posting about the situation ""on the ground,"" so to speak here in Tokyo, as well as the most reliable information that I and other long-0term expats and locals have gleaned.Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe? https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…The situation in Japan is changing rapidly, daily, more than daily. It's hard to keep track of what's happening right now, let alone in a few days or weeks. Personally, I'm a skeptic, like many others here, and believe things may get worse before they get better.But I also try to stay practical, sort out fact from fiction, and find and share useful advice, information, and informed opinion.

"“The epidemic in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan remain the WHO’s greatest concern.”https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/art…"
The truths are often covered up here. :(I hope the speculation is wrong but it sounds like the corona virus could be all around us.
