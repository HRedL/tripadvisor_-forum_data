"We were ticketed to fly on American Airlines from Miami/Curacao on 17March but the Curacao government closed their borders to non-nationals so although AA was still operating the flight, we couldn’t travel. (Lucky for us). I can’t see anything on the AA website about a full refund, only info about rebooking for travel at a later date. We purchased our tickets from the AA website in October 2019. Would we be entitled to a refund under these circumstances? We are Australians and had no option but to return home. Curacao was to be part of our holiday whilst in the area and there is no way we could be back to fly to Curacao later in the year (due to cost, no vacation time and it’s over 33hours of travel away). Thanks."
I would have thought that this was something for your travel insurance to cover - if you booked the flights that long ago hopefully your insurance WILL cover c.virus issues even though more recently purchased policies obviously won't.
"You will be eligible for a refund if and when AA cancels the flight, But even then AA will be really pushng rebooking.as the primary option.And we bought travel insurance back in December for a trip next month. Epidemics are excluded."
"From your post on the Curacao forum on March 17th, you wrote :""AA arranged new flights on AA/Qantas the same afternoon to get us home. ""Were you charged by AA or Quantas for these flights or even changes to your original flight itinerary? If not, IMO AA has provided you duty of care by moving your flights, so you weren't ""stranded in the US"", as you indicated in your other post. You also indicated you were very grateful to be able to get home before Quantas suspended flights, so can't you just be grateful that happened? IF AA hadn't stepped in, you would likely have been out additional expenses to stay in Miami while your travel arrangements got sorted out, as you clearly were not originally scheduled to go back to Australia on the 17th.You will needed to check with AA and your travel insurance for a ruling to see whether you will be entitled to any refunds. No one here can answer that with certainty.airpizz - the OP's flight was scheduled for 5 days ago and as stated, was not cancelled. Airlines are still operating some flights to get people back from places like the Caribbean, while not allowing anyone but residents to enter the island(s)"
"Menorca -I initially felt confident that having travel insurance would cover us until reading their webpage which advises they do not cover pandemics. The insurance company normally expects us to try to obtain a refund from the providers before making a claim, however due to the magnitude of the Covid19 situation I don’t imagine getting any response from AA for some time. Thanks.airpizz6 - Thanks. When I can see that AA have cancelled the BON/MIA flight I can try the refund process.The other hotels and airline will not offer any refund so will lodge an insurance claim (around $3000) for their consideration along with my supporting info etc and will see how we go.At no time have I written anything showing a “lack of gratitude” in relation to QF, AA or anyone else. As a matter of fact we expressed extreme gratitude to the AA guy who helped us and to the Bonaire hotel that did offer a full refund. On this forum I merely asked for thoughts relating to getting a refund from AA."
"Given that the flight operated, I don't think you're entitled to a refund. you would be covered by AA's coronavirus policy but that only lets you cancel the trip and rebook at a later date. I think you could use the credit to rebook on a different route if that helps.https:/…coronavirus-updates.jsp"
