"Glad some of you are enjoying it, good to see the haters out in force! For what it’s worth, I flew out here 16 days ago, when everything was “normal”."
That was surreal. Thanks for posting it. Safe travels home.
WowThank you for sharing this
Thank you for the video.
Wow. Thanks.
Thank you for the video. Hopefully I won’t see anything like that again
"Thanks for the video, Russ. Have a safe trip home."
"Glad you;re back on the forum, Russ. Safe travels home."
That video is nothing new to those of us who still have visited Atlantic City in the past 5 years.Remember to turn out the lights when you leave Ross.
Thanks for posting Russ. Nice to see you back on here again too !Safe journey home
"Oh man. I was supposed to be there for ConExpo last week. CANCELLED. Next week to visit parents, they are on the way home as I type this. Vegas better get ready, because when this is all over, I’ve got a lot of pent up Vegasing to do!"
"Thanks for the vid. It's sad to see Vegas like this, and I have sympathy for all the people who have now lost their livelihood. May Vegas return to her former glory soon."
"Also, thanks Russ"
Thank you Russ. Glad to see you back on the TA Las Vegas forum.
Thanks Russ! Viva Las Vegas my friend!
WOW! What a sight that is. Thanks for sharing. Hope you made it home in good shape.
"Thank you, helps to reinforce the seriousness of the coronavirus."
"That's incredible, thanks for sharing. Thanks for posting, I always enjoyed your trip reports!"

"Brett, relax , take a deep breathe ...maybe yo can provide something relevant"
"You missed yo , instead of you...Glad you are able to contribute something...what a tool"
"Contributing to the forum the fact you are a sad lonely, pathetic person..."
"How is it 'narcissistic' or 'a new level of low'?You can see from the other responses that the original post and video were very much appreciated by all. Russ gauged the likely interest level very well imho. It is the Vegas forum after all, and we're getting a first hand account of something none of us thought would ever happen in Vegas. Of course we're interested."
Wow! So hard to believe this is really happening...so sad!Thanks for posting!

"Sad but interesting video! Thanks for sharing!!Great to see you back in the forum!!!However, you forgot to show one thing in your video.....your shoes!"
"Thanks for sharing the video, safe travels home."
Reminds me of the MALL in Dawn of the Dead. Not a soul around. Thanks for sharing.
I’m back!13
That's heartbreaking. Kind of had to see it to believe it.
Thanks to all well wishers. I’m home now and got a free upgrade on the flight which was my first ever “bump” and a nice bonus.Supermarkets in the UK are barren. People are panic buying lettuces.
"You don’t say? It seems to be happening everywhere, but lettuce is a new one. I guess they have to grab whatever’s left??13"
Maybe lettuce because the TP has run out???
"Thanks Russ for the video, hope you make it home safely!Kim CEdited: 3:10 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Lol rhynoman7,But is lettuce flushable?Welcome home Russ TEdited: 3:20 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Lettuce is at least biodegradable
Cos it is :-)
"Something I never thought I would see. So sad. Hope this resolves in the near, not far, future. Thanks"
Thank you Russ for posting. I am happy that you were able to finally get a flight out and are now home. Stay healthy!
"I never thought of using lettuce as toilet paper! Sure beats eating the stuff : )(Siddy, 'Cos it is' - nice one!)"
"Thanks Jam, thought it was a little gem myself."
"Siddy, as lettuce jokes go, I'm sure it was only the tip of the iceberg?"
"Jam, true , the Webb's Wonderful for lettuce jokes."
"Pretty sad that such a ""fan"" did not listen to authorities and continued to stay past advisable times."

Thanks for sharing this very different view of Las Vegas during these difficult times.

Let's hope things are back to ""normal"" very soon so the world is safer again and we can enjoy our happy place in Vegas."
