"Smiling Lady 52 ... the year I was born in...19 not 1852. Yes things accelerated negatively, in Spain, this morning.I believe there are restrictions and cancellations on any events which would attract more than 1000 visitors. Must include Concert Halls, some Theatres and of course the Camp Nou, but not for Tours.Even the Sagrada Familia, who already limit the numbers, inside, at all times, have lowered that number so that people might have more distance between them and the next person when wandering around.As regards Sitges and the getting to and from the City and or Airport, I doubt anything like that might happen on enclosed spaces such as the Monbus service , Trains and other Public Transport services in the region, immediately.Anthony K"
Queenz closing down till April
Think he may well be right unfortunately Gaz and if you do get there and staying in a hotel that may be forced to close. Either way not a nice situation for you to be in
Nem Restaurant is closed for next 2 weeks
"All restaurants will be closed, all over Catalyna, starting today. Not just that one..."
"Anthony K, aka Doubting Thomas, at present, feels that Governments acting in regard to the pandemic will mean that I will not be able to take my planned visit to Sitges & Barcelona in eight weeks time.It is now recorded that dyslexics, of both sexes, cannot get into bras.Keep well allAnthony K"
"@gazthejambo, you fly tomorrow, right?There is a good chance that you will not be allowed to arrive. The Catalan government has announced that the airports will be closed, but they need the cooperation of the Spanish for that (and given the current political climate, Spain might very well decide not to cooperate – simply because it’s Catalunya…).Your best hope is probably that this gets cleared out today, and that after an official decision you’ll have ways of getting your money back."
"I will play by ear , thanks for the info"
"Contagious viruses spread like bees around a honey pot.So many Forums now appear as if one is re-reading texts.Sad, so sad...Anthony K"
All jet2 flights from UK to spain cancelled I'm hearing
The negative consequences are just spiralling...Keep well allAnthony K
"Yes Gaz, just read Jet2 have cancelled all flights to Spain with seven of them being turned back mid-flight."
"Spain declared a state of emergency yesterday. According to local media reports, the Government were expected to announce a nationwide lockdown later this afternoon. 15.40 UK time.Anthony KPS - An announcement, due at 3pm, Spain time, will almost certainly be made in the next few hours.Edited: 11:43 am, March 14, 2020 "
TUI holidays to Spain cancelled.Anthony K
"Re: Coronavirus15 Mar 2020, 07:15The UK Govt is advising that no-one should travel to Spain unless that is essential travel ... eg - getting home.1) Might you regard a vacation as essential travel and thus can you get there relatively easily...2) Are any of the major attractions remaining open, even though everything else is closing ... Restaurants, Cafes, Bars etc.3) If you travel to Spain, now or anytime soon, will you have to self-isolate when you arrive home, even if you do not have any Flu-like symptoms.4) Will the UK Govt Advice plus the action taken by Spanish Authorities improve the situation for those needing refunds...This morning, I hear, that as from Tuesday EasyJet will be stopping all flights to and from Spain.Keep wellAnthony"
"I wouldn’t imagine a holiday would be regarded as essential travel .I would be concerned that if I travelled despite FCO advice my travel insurance would not be valid . A holiday at this time would not be enjoyable, now is the time to stay at home and look after those around us who need our support ."
"Sure, I agree. In the circumstances, if things deteriorate, I feel that people will be contacted by those companies they have booked with.Anthony K"
Well they could close the airports. That’s happening in Italy.
They haven't closed them so the Spanish can fly in and go home and the other nationalities can leave and fly back home.
I’ve been told Sitges is in lock down and people cannot leave their homes otherwise fined....is thus true?!!
"Justine. Yes true. If you're on FB here are some pictures posted today. The town is empty.https://m.facebook.com/story.php…Edited: 5:21 pm, March 15, 2020 "
You are allowed to go to the food shops to buy food or the farmacia for medicine
"Re: Coronavirus16 Mar 2020, 03:33Personal note ...I have e-mailed my chosen Hotel in Sitges, regarding my May 19th to 26th booking, and expect an answer today...British Airways appear not to have cancelled, as yet, and are not inviting people to contact them unless you are due to travel in the next 72 hours,I doubt that I will be able to take this vacation, on my desired dates, and a delay until June may not see circumstances improving.On a more positive note my Insurance does have a clause that covers ""cancellations"" and it would, I believe, pay me if either my Hotel or Airline does not.I wish everyone well and if you are having to self-isolate, because there is nowhere to go, I hope you are getting deliveries of essential medication, food and drinks.CheersAnthony KPS - My desire is to be as positive as possible at the present time."
"Anthony, again (since you have posted this several times, as so many of your ""personal notes""), your travel plans are two months in the future. Let companies handle their customers with travel plans in the next few days / weeks. Why don't you wait and see what happens after that?"

"Re Post 28 ...The El Cid Hotel replied ...Dear Mr. Kreppel,The hotel is closed until March 30, but these dates may change as the situation evolves. In principle for the day of arrival, May 19, it should be open, but in case it is not open, we will make the returnKind regardsManel LeónDpto. Reservas"
Anthony K - did you book a refundable rate? I booked just one night at Hotel Platjador but it was a non-refundable rate. The rest of my trip has already been canceled so I won't need the one night in Sitges in April. I'll wait until closer to April to contact the hotel but I'm probably out of luck. For airfare too! Does your travel insurance cover cancellation for pandemics? Mine does not. :-(Linda
"gazthejamboWhen are you due to travel?Simply contact both ... Customer services numbers or website forms, if you cannot get through to a particular section.https:/…contact-ushttps://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/homeOtherwise, speak with your Insurer.Don't be fobbed off with vouchers that may be less than decent.Any news from you would be appreciated.Keep WellAnthony K"
"IswmeI paid in full, non-refundable ... but I now have a solid e-mail, saved, that says they will ""return"" my outlay. Let's hope they do not try to wriggle out of that commitment, if and when...Insurance-wise my Policy covers ""cancellations,"" but I have not read it, recently, to see if it covers this ""natural"" disaster.CheersAnthonyEdited: 1:59 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Anthony. Gazthejambo was due out last Sunday so doubt he'll be following this thread now. Saw on a FB group he got full refund from airbnb but don't know how he got on with RyanairEdited: 4:58 am, March 18, 2020 "
I just sent an email to Hotel Platjador. I am booked for just one night on Apr 19th and don't believe travel to Spain will be allowed at that time even if the hotel is open. My Marrakesh/Sahara package (was overnighting in Sitges on my way home from Morocco) has been cancelled. My outbound flight was booked with points on American so I'm hopeful they'll let me redeposit the points with no fee (usually $150). My other two flight segments are on Ryanair and Level Airlines so will wait to see if the flights are cancelled. Level has already offered for me to change the dates with no change fee but I will not be able to complete this trip by the end of 2020 so we shall see what other offers they make if the flight is cancelled.
I already heard back from the hotel and they said they have issued a refund! Wish me luck with getting a refund on my airfare. :-)
"Hi, American Airlines changed our flight home at no cost. We left this past Friday and got back to JFK at 10:30 pm (Friday night). I waited on hold with American for two hours but once I got an agent on the line, she was very nice. I am having pretty good luck canceling our other activities. Working with Renfe now to cancel tickets that we planned to use later this week. Loved our trip to Spain and Sitges - Just sorry it was shortened and want to come back and try again next year."
"Mary RPleased to read that things have worked out, under frustrating circumstances, and you are home, I guess, successfully, if not altogether happily.Keeping us up to date, will help others.Stay well and do return to Sitges ... many of us cannot get enough of it.Anthony K"
"44. Under EU rules you should get a refund from the airline for cancelled flights, you don't have to accept a credit note or rebooking."
"My thinking at this time, friends. is that if I cannot visit Sitges & Barcelona, in May, and cannot visit Paris, in September, then I choose Sitges & Barcelona, when the possibility of European travel next arises.Keep well allAnthony KEdited: 12:16 pm, March 25, 2020 "
"At present, and I am sure I am not alone in this, I cannot book a vacation for later in the year for three good reasons.First, it is impossible to know when a vacation to Spain might be possible. Secondly, I must await refunds from my May trip, both Hotel and Flights. Thirdly, presently, both Airlines and Hotel groups seem to be showing higher than normal prices for Sept/Oct bookings.Hopefully, in the Summer, I will find something acceptable.Liaising with all of you, positively, is something I sincerely wish to return to, as soon as possible.Keep well allAnthony K"
"I have now completed a Hotel and Flights booking to Barcelona/Sitges for early October. I hope that things normalise before then and people get the Summer vacations they need.Although new cases, and more sadly new deaths, are being reported, in Spain, on a daily basis, the numbers do seem to be dropping slightly. If that pattern continues over a decent period of time, then perhaps travel restrictions will be lifted.Keep well allAnthony K"
