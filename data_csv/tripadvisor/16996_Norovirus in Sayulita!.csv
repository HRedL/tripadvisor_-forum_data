"Just got back from Sayulita (March 14 - March 18) and my fiance and I both ended up with Norovirus (vomiting and diarrhea, fever, chills, body ache for 24+ hours and I am still feeling the effects of it now). While there we toured a few wedding venues and at one of the venues we visited we found out that the entire wedding party had been sick with norovirus and had to have a nurse and IVs brought in. Needless to say, we quickly decided against a wedding in Sayulita, as well as a return to this town."
Hi Katelyn - I was in Sayulita last week as well to tour wedding venues. We had a great time and did not get sick but are of couse now concerned! Do you know where people got sick?

"To clarify: The ""raw sewage in the streets"" was a one-time thing caused by a plumbing problem at a new hotel. The problem was fixed within a day."
Just got back from 5 days in Sayulita. Great time great town; no issues.
"We held our daughter’s wedding Nov 2017 at the Terazola in Sayulita and had the most fabulous wedding. Raquel went over and above to ensure that the bride and groom had the wedding of their dreams. As for sickness, we had a couple of sun strokes, dehydration and cervesa flu, that is all!"
"My 16 year old and I just spent 12 days there and loved it. We borh got sick on day 10 despite precautions. Stomach upset, vomiting, diarrhea, fever. I am home and still symptomatic and doctors are running tests."
Norovirus is back with a vengeance in Sayulita January 2019. We have spoke with many people and they have got it as well as 4 in our group with the others starting to get stomach cramps I’m sure more to come. They need to clean up this beautiful little town. Love Sayulita and have come before but this definitely ruins a holiday
"I live in Sayulita year-round. Local ex-pats and nationals are unaffected by the travel related ailments that afflict visitors. To get the most enjoyment from your Sayulita beach vacation, wash your hands or use sanitizer before eating or preparing food, avoid food sold by vendors on the beach and drink bottled water. Alcohol to excess impairs your judgement so go easy on the tequila. Simple steps like this will reduce your risk of contacting an illness during your visit to paradise!"
I would agree but the 6 that are now sick did not drink in excess as they are to young and did wash there hands and we prepared food from wallmart and Costco. I suspect the water as they were all swimming as thought that did not swim are all right
"Well, this is unfortunate. We have been coming to Sayulita for 5 years for a couple of days and up to one week. I discounted the the illness that was reported on tripadvisor. My husband and I just and took a cab from Sayulita to Puerto Vallarta after spending 2 days in Sayulita. My husband is horribly ill, and I am sick too, although not as bad. What a terrible thing to happen on an expensive short yearly vacation.We will never come back. The town was packed with people. It was dirty.The trip to and from was do slow due to traffic that was crazy. I feel bad for a little place I really did love, but NEVER again."
"Kathryn S, I'm sorry you became so ill so quickly but I do know that Norovirus incubation is generally longer than you've given it and I'm thinking perhaps it was picked up on the plane or at an airport, where more people congregate in close quarters. Also, really, you came at the second busiest time of year for the entire country. For half the world, really. How you could somehow put the blame on Sayulita for being ""packed with people"" and the traffic on the highway was slow and somehow that's Sayulita's fault, is simply beyond me. I hope you enjoy tranquil, traffic-free Puerto Vallarta."
"I should have clarified that literally 99% of the traffic on Hwy. 200 was not going to Sayulita. I have been on that highway each day for the last three days and cars and buses are not turning off at Sayulita but are either going to Puerto Vallarta from further north, or headed further north from Puerto Vallarta to probably Guadalajara, Tepic or Compostela."
"We loved Sayulita, but sadly 9 of the 11 people in our family group are sick after a week long visit. I inquired about the water issues prior to our trip and was assured that there was nothing wrong, and that ongoing problems had been rectified. We are an experienced group of travelers, and have been to Mexico many times previously without issue, so we clearly know how to prevent issues. I can recall only one pharmacy in the entire town of Playa del Carmen which is much larger. There is a pharmacy on every block of Sayulita, in order to manage the extent of illness experienced there. I feel for the business owners who do not want this problem to ruin their livelihood, but we will not be returning to Sayulita again."
"Honestly. I took the time to post on my vacation. Granted my husband is ill beyond belief in our hotel room, so I do have some time which normally would be spent out and about.Please do not discount this warning I would really hate for anyone coming here to get as sick as my husband. Or, to feel pretty rottten like I do. Especially with vulnerable older adults or children. I travel a lot on planes. This illness is not associated with plane travel.  I truly do not want anyone to suffer a really horrible blow to a possibly infrequent vacation. I feel bad to negatively post something that could affect the kind people of Sayulita, and we have truly experienced kind people. But this is really a terrible problem. And as far as traffic. It was terrible to and from Sayulita from Puerto Vallarta. I am sure people were going many different places, but I am only commenting on the traffic we experienced taking an Uber to Sayulita and a taxi to Puerto Vallarta. Really? You are going to argue the fact that most people aren't going to Sayulita? Does it matter??This will be my last post on this issue. I took the time to post to possibly help other travelers. I would hope this forum would be a place to give an honest account of experiences without people trying to discredit others."
"Katheryn, thank you. Were you and your husband in the water? I’m trying to figure out if it’s food, drinking water or the ocean that is the problem. We are not staying in Sayulita but my son wants to surf there as we were there 2 years ago. I’m hoping not to spoil his dream."
"Hi, we were not in the water swimming but walked along the shore getting our feet wet. We did rent lounge chairs on the beach. We stayed right in town and ate at various restaurants in town. We did a lot of walking all over the town.  Currently we are both layed up in our Puerto Vallarta hotel room. I took a really bad turn for the worse last night. We are hoping that we can salvage part of the day today, as we are feeling just a little better after losing all of yesterday to this horrible illness.  We are no longer throwing up, but still very achy with some nausea. It is just terrible to be away from home and deathly ill, and to be losing a precious vacation we have been looking forward to with great anticipation. We also experienced a copious amount of loud music into the wee hours of the morning too as the other contributers are reporting. Arghhhhh."
the only thing that keeps Sayulita open is the fact that the people who have the means to close them are here temporary and nobody died yet...let's hope it doesn't have to come to this...
Norovirus struck my family as well! Everyone (12 people) but my infant son and my husband experienced this Sayulita special. It truly is unfortunate that so many visitors get this when the town is so amazing and full of life! I was reading an article where local expats and nationals put together a 5 part plan to help with the sewage problems that currently exist.If the infrastructure could handle the large amounts of tourists that flood into town during these busy times this norovirus thing would not be such a big problem.
We are here in Sayulita now and almost everyone in our group (10) is sick. The river smells like raw sewage because there is raw sewage in it. Google Sayulita water quality and read the articles. We wish we heeded the warnings. I strongly recommend avoiding Sayulita at all costs. They need to fix this long on-going problem and stop pretending it’s just from the tourists coming here sick. We travel 5-6 weeks a year and have never ever seen it this bad.
this is so disappointing! I'm headed there in 2 days for a retreat. ugh. any recommendations of things to pack and bring incase I get this?
Imodium maybe...
"Extra underwear ;-) I've been there 6 or 8 times in the past 24 months, stayed overnight 3xI've never had a hint of sickness. I'm not saying that it's not a concern however I find it interesting that many who have reported traveling with 'large groups' and got 'deathly ill' have 1 post. Some claim to be experienced travelers. They have not posted any other posts for anywhere in the world with any questions OR answers. They asked no questions before their trip. Their ONLY post is to complain about Sayulita and they have nothing else to post (good or bad) about any other forum for anywhere in the world.I spent 6 separate weeks in the PV are last year, from Yelapa to San Blas. I talk to people. Not one person mentioned getting sick in Sayulita OR knowing anyone who didEdited: 1 year ago "
nhsets...i can assure you that's not the case...most people tend to post something when it was above or under expectations...and getting violently sick on holiday is in that category...most people have vacations that meet the expectations...why bother writing about it?
"Alu I said I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT'S NOT A CONCERN did you miss that ? Lots of people go to Sayulita and don't get sick. Ever. When 10 of 12 in a group do get sick, it's an opportunity to figure out what/where these people did/ate. Much better than trying to figure out why random people got sick. I just find it interesting that there are so many single posts from people who have nothing else to offer about anywhere else in the world. Am I allowed to make an observation Do I need your permission ?  I don't care if people go or don't go to Sayulita. I have no interests thereEdited: 1 year ago "
nshets...because of posts like yours people ended up going and got sick...
Hand sanitizer
"nhsets we live here and travel to Sayulita every couple weeks. We swim in the ocean, eat in the restaurants and talk to tourists on the beach that are in town for a vacation. To a person we have never spoken to anyone who is experiencing the problems which you are hyping."
Luv Can you read ? What am I 'hyping' ?
"If you are staying in a place where you will be preparing your own food I would recommend buying a bottle of fruit and veggie washing solution (we also used it for rinsing our dishes. It is supposed to kill any of the ickes that the tap water has.Also, if you walk north of the beach in sayulita, around 6 PM they maybe releasing baby sea turtles (if any hatched that day). Super fun, and the public gets to help. Not everyone who visits gets sick, but it is good to know of the possibility ahead of time."
"It's like this every year. Every year. People get sick there. Go back and read threads from 3, 4, 5 years ago. Maybe longer. Every year they're going to fix the sewer issues and yet it seems like they never do. Some people go and never get sick. Others go and get sick immediately. I've been there once, didn't get sick, but didn't like the place and I surely wouldn't risk going back and getting sick. Not worth it. YMMV.."
"10 of us out of our group of 18 all went to Sayulita. All of us that went to Sayulita all got violently ill(vomiting non stop, diarrah, body aches, sweating, chills) 6 out of 10 didn’t go into ocean, but we all ate at the same restaurant and had drinks. 3 were kids, 7 adults."
"Me & my boyfriend just spent 3.-6.1. In Sayulita and both got really sick. Me after 1 day and my boyfriend after 2 days. We didn’t swim in the ocean at all and had hand sanitizer at all times. He has traveled many years in 3rd world countries and this was his 2nd time this happened. Sh...y start for a 2 weeks holiday and it’s still bothering us... :( after seeing How many people got sick I definitely wouldn’t go back, sad."
You have attempted to deny the sickness issue in Sayulita year after year Harry. Why don't you take a break and let some one else carry the ball. Anyone who looks at your posts going back year after year will see that you have zero credibility and have no objectivity on this issue.
"Katheryn S. I’m sorry you’re having such an unfortunate experience with sickness. Thank you for clarifying. After all I’ve read, it seems the food/drink is the biggest offender. If we go, and it’s a big “if” at this point, we will definitely bring our lunch for the day. Thank you and to all that are warning us about these problems so our vacations are also not ruined. You can’t imagine how much I, and many others on here, appreciate it. Hoping you feel better."
"I am planning a trip, leaving in 4 days to Sayulita and just now read about these Norovirus incidences. Have others gotten sick lately? It is now going on the end of February and these posts are scary at best. I am wondering whether to cancel our trip or try and move elsewhere, maybe farther up the coast. Any ideas anyone?"
"We are here in the area now. Have made two separate trips to Sayulita. My son who took surfing lessons (so he was in the water) did not get anything. It’s been several days since so I feel confident he’s going to remain healthy. Our entire family ate at Barracudas and Cocobanana, both good restaurants (try the cocobanana) and none of us contracted it either. Go to Sayulita, it would be a shame if you miss it. Parking is a real pain FYI. Saturdays in February they have a festival going on though we are staying clear of it because of the crowds. My 80 year old mother is with me and I don’t feel like dealing with it. The town is lots of fun and very different from the resort feel elsewhere. Have a great time!"
"pepperanne...please read all the recent threads about it...people that don't get sick are just lucky, not the ones getting sick different or doing something wrong..."
"Remember that while many might get sick and post on here, there are also many that do not get sick and do not post on here. You should be careful and drink bottled water and follow other food precautions, no doubt about it. Sayulita, however, it a fun and cool little town. If you feel more comfortable staying in Nuevo Vallarta and just visiting Sayulita during the day, then do that. That’s mostly what we did. We didn’t stay in Sayulita because our timeshare is in Nuevo Vallarta. It’s an easy car ride or taxi ride there. Easily a day destination if that works better for you."
"There are pharmacies on every block all over the area - Bucerias has them as well. They actually are similares which are unregulated pharmacies so it has absolutely nothing to do with sickness in Sayulita which may I add is overhyped. We go there every couple weeks, swim, eat and drink and have never been sick!"
"luvthebeach...you are immune to it already...the issue is not over-hyped...you and others like you continue to put doubt in peoples' minds like a very good defense attorney ....sayulita is a public health issue in an area that is stuck in thirld world but wants first world money ...well, in that case it's time for them to provide first world facilities..."
"Luvthebeach.. wrong it's not a flu bug,or food issue. That's dumb.! Are you saying People like Bonne#40 lies.! Unreal!. As #33 David says.. Years and Years of denying is not good for the town.Until the waste is taken care of it's going to get worse.Look out for the Easter 2 weeks.. crowds."
"Just had our wedding in sayulita. It was an incredibly beautiful wedding and experience, really awesome, pretty much couldn’t have been better. Only 2 people out of the 120 missed the wedding because they got sick, but then after wedding probably 20-30 people or more got super sick. It’s something about Sayulita. This doesn’t happen to the same degree in the rest of Mexico. When we visited in November for wedding planning, my wife and I got extremely sick on our last day and it took us about 2 weeks plus to fully recover. We thought it was E. coli poisoning from something we ate, but now in hindsight realize it must have been Norovirus. It luckily worked out for us because we had immunity and didn’t get sick for our wedding, if we had gotten sick before our wedding it would have completely ruined our wedding for sure. We had heard of people getting sick from swimming in the water, but that’s definitely not what caused people to get sick. It’s really bizarre and unfortunate because Sayulita is a truly beautiful, very special place and everyone had the the time of their life. We feel bad for the people that got sick, of course if we knew about this we would have chosen to get married somewhere else, but it was pretty much the best wedding ever prior to people getting sick."
"We're also just recently back from a week in Sayulita, Feb. 2-9. It's probably our 15th yearly visit.Four out of 6 of us got Norovirus: projectile vomiting; chills; explosive diarrhea, that lasted about 24-36 hours. It was my first time to be sick in a few years, but partner's fourth year in a row.It's very disappointing, especially for only a one-week visit, but hopefully it won't keep us from coming back. We narrowed it down to Tacos Ivan (the pastor street taco place) as the likely culprit, or perhaps Costeno's, both of which were very crowded for the first two nights of our visit because of Festival Sayulita. Perhaps by avoiding festival time, along with the improvements to the sewer treatment plant, will help the odds."
Read this to learn about why there's such a bad problem https:/…index.htmlNorovirus is highly contagious and difficult to eradicate. https:/…I won't set foot in Sayulita.
Jul...i posted another link months ago...i'm curious how many read it or took it seriously...you have no idea how many offensive posts i endured all these years because i insisted on this place being a health hazard ...
"They seem to be working on installing some large piping in town likely due to the sanitation situation. The pipe is laying on the sides of the river and there were people actively working. I did not stand around and watch and what it’s purpose is, I have no idea. Just giving everyone a heads up. If someone is in the know, please enlighten us but there is some type of improvement underway."
"I worry about people leaving Sayulita and heading to PV and spreading the virus. Also the flights home, that's a concern. Yes, avoiding the entire area for awhile."

Heidi the pipes you see will the pipes used to pump the treated waste from the newly expanded treatment plant many km’s out into the ocean as done by many major west coast coastal cities in the USA and Canada.
"Relaxing, I haven't posted about this issue very much, maybe confused me with someone else? I have only been to Sayulita twice, first time was amazing, about 10 years ago. Last time was 3 years ago, and it was so packed, unable to walk the sidewalks and it just wasn't pleasant. My concern is all the people that are checking out of their Sayulita hotels and possibly taking their virus to other hotels in PV. Not sure why you have your knickers in such a knot?"
I apologize I should have said #46
"lovemex...you're using two names ?...i'm going to post as much as i want...until no more sickness there or this place is closed for sanitation...snorkeler...that is an issue and more than likely has caused a lot of confusion for people visiting around the bay ...people that visit some place safe get sick , and ignorants like lovemex or relaxing or harry tell people that there are people getting sick in other parts....this is not a sayulita problem, come and visit , it's safe...the truth is sayulita has infected thousands of people over the years and got away with it...now finally the government is doing something about it while they're open for business , and they get all aggravated when you call them on it , considering this is normal... well you don't get to be offended by this...this is your little punishment...quite painless i would say..."
"5 friends just came back. All 5 got it. So....over the past 3 years that is 28 out of 29 people that I know who have gone, including my own family, that have gotten it. Everything that they described to me about their experience is spot on with my own. Everytime I hear of someone talking about going to Sayulita I try to talk them out of it."
"We just got back from Sayulita. 6 out of the 8 in our group sick so far. Maybe somebody should report these problems to the US government so they can warn travelers not to head there? There is a huge problem. I’ve been all over Mexico, at least 10 cities on multiple occasions and I’ve never gotten sick so it obviously has something specific to do with the city. Public health officials should discourage traveling there. Take my word. It must be airborne."
"My husband and I plan to leave the Upper Midwest soon for a 10-day stay in Sayulita. Having just read about the number of visitors to this community who have been stricken with norovirus, we're understandably alarmed. What, we wonder, is the current status of this situation? Are visitors still dealing with this health threat? If so, are there practical steps we should take before arriving that might spare us a disagreeable (to say the least!) experience? Thanks in advance for providing any available up-to-date information."
"Wow, missed all the Deleted Inappropriate posts.There are locals here who have downplayed the issue for Year and years ,look at the Dates of the Threads.. Read them, some suggestions , but Good Luck."
"My family and I travel a lot. China, Europe, Central America, Africa, all over Mexico ....last time we got sick was 20 years ago. We spent Presidents' Day weekend in an upscale boutique resort in Sayulita and on day 4 my husband and I came down with fever, chills, horrible headache, nausea and diarrhea. We still feel poorly 3 days later. We were told in town my a fellow tourist that ""everyone gets it!"" . We saw a little girl vomiting on the street in town and could hear our neighbors at the resort vomiting as well. We won't be back until the sanitation standards are better in Sayulita."
That's bad. Hope you see Doctor.#53. Good catch.
"Your denial of a real health problem here is disappointing. I have traveled throughout Mexico for the last 25 years. I know how to take precautions. I got the neuroviris two days ago and have been violently ill, never been this sick before. Every person I have talked to knows at least one person in the same boat. The ""Sayulita Sickness"" secret that locals don't want travelers to know about is becoming known as others like me dispel the myth of this ""magical"" town. I will never return and advise others not to do so."
"I greatly appreciate your post and wish I had seen one like it prior to coming here for a one week vacation. Like you I have traveled extensively throughout Mexico and know how to take precautions. I got sick Thursday night and have been violently ill since then. I had to buy a pack of Depends as precaution for flying out tomorrow. I plan to write a lengthy informative review for others as well. Travelers are finally unmasking the ""Sayulita Sickness"" secret to forewarning others. I hope your husband is well soon. Take care."
"If you can go somewhere else, do. I am a seasoned Mexico traveler. I got the virus Thursday night and have never been so ill before. Took all the food and hand sanitizer precautions, but swam in the water. Going home tomorrow and will never return here. Good luck."
"Don’t go. Maybe stay in PV, or head north to San Blas or other destinations around the area like Punta Mita, which is s clean beach. We are from MN too and are home and almost all in group got ill. They have something airborne in the city causing people to catch the virus via respiratory, it’s beenconfirmed as a rotovirus. There us raw sewage in the city and the ocean is contaminated in that area. Nothing is being done. Just cancel and change reservation somewhere else."
"Please take note... Yes, one in our party did get Norovirus 2/21/2019 swimming on the beach but please read this. While exploring we came across the river that was flowing sewage directly into the water at the swimming beach downtown. I looked very closely and found many black sewage pipes on the bank of the river. I also found a work crew under the bridge in town making a final weld on a new sewage pipe. The next day walking across the bridge I saw the liquid flow on the surface had stopped. I know there were many tourists in town and we were taxing the sewer system. I believe they corrected the problem. So here is my recommendation for travel... Walk the beach first and if there is an open sewer running across the beach then don't go swimming. We went swimming over in Playa de los muertos thinking is would be far enough away but we're sadly wrong. Sayulita is a fantastic place we look forward to returning to."
I wish I would of read this before going up Sayulita this past week. We were there to celebrate a friends birthday. The day after his party 12 out of 16 of us got sick with the noro virus!! Even a little guy just 1 1/2 years old!! Poor baby!! It was terrible!! We will never go back there again!! The water looked disgusting and there was a sewer that ran out into the ocean. Do yourself a favor and go to Punta Mita.
"We went to sayulita for 2 hours last Thursday and came back with the norovirus! We only hung out on the beach and surfed. All bathrooms there need to be scrubbed down, including the door handles. We didn’t even eat. Just sat in chairs, surfed and went to the surf shop bathroom and then back to Nuevo Vallarta 5 star hotel.5 out of 8 of us for extremely ill from it."
"I'm sorry to hear that you became ill but please note that many people do get sick at 5star resorts, such as Grand Fiesta Americana, Barcelo, etc."
We went fromNuevo Vallarta to Sayulita for 2 hours of surfing. We didn’t even eat and 5 out of 8 of us for extremely sick. The cute town was very dirty. My guess is it we got sick from the bathrooms at the surf shop. Lysol the town amigos!
"scurvin, my boyfriend and I just returned from a trip to Sayulita from 2/19-2/23, and I have never been that sick in my life. On our 3rd night I started vomiting worse than I ever have in my life, and was in bed for 36 hours. My boyfriend got a really bad fever, but it didn't hit him too hard until a few days later. He got really bad diarrhea (thankfully it hit after our day of travel). We both had to miss work. It has been 5 days since it hit me, and I am still not better. I have not thrown up in a few days, but I am still very nauseous, fatigued, and lightheaded. Sayulita is a great little town, so it was a huge bummer to get so sick while there."
"Relaxing J, thank you for the information. I didn’t understand the purpose of that pipe until now. It is sad we are dumping sewage into the sea."
"Heidi, there's no sewage being dumped into the sea now that the treatment plant has been fixed. The water being pumped out about 2km into the ocean will be treated waste water."
#68. So sad for you.Not nice when you report and other says IT happens at resorts too. LOLThis has been going on for YEARS.
"#72, as a DE you should know not to laugh at other posters' comments. It's rude. As you've said time and time again, everyone is entitled to their opinion. And yes, it does happen at resorts too, like the ones I mentioned, to name just a couple."
"How do you know, have you stayed as that resort.?Your the one saying she got sick someplace else. No rule on LOL. worse comment by you.Done"
"I know about that from reading on TripAdvisor forum. Just like you know about Sayulita, without having been here in several years. I suppose some rules only apply to other people, not to you and the other one. Sad."
"Harry...all these years when people , including me, the other one, signaled problems in sayulita you were very dismissive and arrogant , when you should've been out of business...now, when finally something was done , you got arrogant again....well...let's hope this fixes the problem and we don't have to see each other's posts anymore...still, haven't seen a public apology from anybody in sayulita ...as for other resorts...those problems aren't continuous for years...those are the type of problems that ""happen""...what is going on in sayulita is a complete disregard for people well-being..."
"Another similar story to add to the data in this thread. Booked our trip to Sayulita, saw all the info about sickness but couldn’t cancel so we geared up with all the meds and sanitizers we could find. To no avail. Everyone of the 12 people in our family became violently ill within 36 hours of arriving. Not travelers sickness. Violent, gut wrenching vomiting, diarrhea and fever. Had a doctor make a house call to our villa to treat our family. There’s no secret on the cause of the volume of illness here, just take a walk down the beach to where the “river” enters the ocean and you can smell and see sewage effluent flowing directly onto the beach. Today construction equipment is working in the river bed redirecting the flow of effluent to allow them to lay pipe, presumably for a new sewage outfall pipe deeper out to sea, as described in local news. It’s a tragedy that such a beautiful town can be allowed to be over run to the extent that basic first world sanitation can’t be maintained. Avoid Sayulita for your holiday until it can demonstrate it meets basic expectations for health that most modern travelers take for granted out of a destination of this type. Otherwise expect to spend the majority of your holiday on the toilet."
My wife and I are retired Canadians and have been coming to Sayulita for 13 years. For the last 7 tears we’ve stayed about two months each trip usually in February to April. My wife has had some some mild stomach upset in the past few years usually a day or so. I have not.We have currently been in Sayulita for 18 days. Of those I have been sick 14 days and my wife 10 days. The sickness is the usual diarrhea vomiting type and is very debilitating. The smell even a couple of blocks from the river is powerfully awful especially as we are not well. I am sure it is airborne and not food related. We have been very careful to adhere to all the usual cleanliness protocols. Neither of us has been swimming at the beach.We usually go to El Costenos late each afternoon for a beer at the beach.There have been several days that the smell has been bad enough for us to turn around and go home.We have spoken to many day visitors from PV and Bucerías and not once has anyone mentioned illness as an issue when asked.They are currently working on “welding” the long sections of ABS piped to take the treated waste out into the ocean according to local about 2 1/2 kilometres. Hopefully that will help.I never thought I’d say it but we will not return next year unless we read conclusive reports that the problem has been addressed.We have friends coming to visit in 2 weeks for a week and are considering returning a month early after their departure.Those that suggest the problems are similar to those occur elsewhere are disingenuous. I say that as someone who loves Sayulita.Also the nightly noise is unbearable every night from about 10 pm to 3am. It did get better a few years ago but has slipped back to its old uncontrolled ways.
"Hi, my name is Rebecca and I own Bliss Studio & Medi Spa in Sayulita. I have lived in Sayulita for 8 years and have had my business there for 5 years. I read your message and thought it important to reply. Yes, Sayulita has had a strong outbreak of the Norovirus (stomach flu) this past month. It has effected locals and tourists alike. The town has been, and is continuing to take all necessary precautions to ensure the health safety of all in Sayulita. Unfortunately, more often then not, viruses are ""brought down"" to Sayulilta via travelers who have already been in contact with the virus in their local area. The United States and Canada are seeing record numbers of this virus this season, primarily I believe due to the radical changes of extreme weather conditions. The common denominator, in all cases that we have experienced here, is that it is not effecting everyone and it seems to be isolated to groups, large and small. It is also a virus that is spread quickly by direct contact, so any contact on a plane (seat, tray table, bathroom, etc.) or within a group of people traveling together present the greatest risk for contact and becoming contagious. I write this to urge you to reconsider Sayulita as a possible destination wedding location or future holiday location. We hope that by informing potential travelers, as well as those already experiencing Sayulita currently, we can help to lesson the spread of this virus and restore the confidence of those desiring to travel here. Best wishes to you and your fiancé on your upcoming nuptials. Cheers, Rebecca D'Este, Bliss Studio & Medi Spa"
Rebecca...this issue has been going on for years...your opinion is at best out of touch with the reality...
"Rebecca, where did you hear that there are record number of cases of Noro in Canada and the US? I have heard the opposite. Also, thanks for the reminder about airplane contact. That is why I'm avoiding PV flights this year. I'm afraid that people that have travelled to Sayulita will spread the virus to me on the flight home, or they may move to my hotel in PV and spread it there."
"While I respect your opinion to my post, I have lived in Sayulita for 8 years and have not been sick until this season (24 hour stomach bug). My post is to reflect that most people who actually live in Sayulita, not for short term or a holiday, are rarely effected by these ""out breaks"". Sayulita began as, and size wise still remains, a little fishing village. The town has grown in population, due to its charm and beauty, greatly in the past 7+ years. A village of approximately 6,000 full time residents, has seen upwards of 20,000 + visitors during certain times of the year (especially Samana Santa). This being said, Sayulita is continuing to work on its infrastructure to be able to handle large capacities of people, From the water plant (that is nearing completion), to road repairs, garbage and recycling projects, life guard additions, CFE improvements, internet accessibility, and the list goes on. I think it is unrealistic to simply expect that Sayulita would instantaneously be ready to handle large influxes of people from the onset. Matters like those that are needed take time, preparation and funding for. Our little pueblo has been consistently moving forward with all matters needed, but it is still a small Mexican village and tourism is extremely essential to this process. It is extremely unfortunate when there are tourisms getting sick or having a bad experience. No one disagrees with that or is defending it. However, I think that it is very important to become as educated as possible regarding such situations before posting on forums like this."
https:/…data.html
So 816 cases in 11 states for a 6 month period and this forum has probably reported more for Sayulita during the same period. It's safe to say that Sayulita has a major problem. Nice solution to pump the untreated waste further out into the ocean.
"It is actually treated waste that is then being pumped out a few miles into the ocean - a very similar process is practiced on coastal areas in the US and Canada. Again, I think it best to be properly educated before posting on these types of forums. And those of us who are local and actually live here are glad to share information at any time as to the progresses that are happening in Sayulita."
"The owners wife, daughter, granddaughter and two workers at the bungalows I am at in Sayulita have been sick in the last few weeks. It is not only tourists becoming ill. It is a serious problem that needs to be seriously addressed. I a long time tourist here won’t be back until it is. I rarely get sick and am now on my 15th day of sickness and am just starting to feel better."
"Before posting on the forum it’s best to get rid of the bs. We all know the treatment plant cannot keep up with the volume, that is why raw sewage is going down the river."
"Again, if you lived here and were properly educated and informed, the waste plant is nearly completed. I would kindly ask you to stop posting things here that you clearly or actually know currently nothing about."
Thank you for your message. Is there a town near PVR airport that you would you recommend for a vacation? I’m flying into PVR in a couple of weeks and was considering Sayulita but am now very concerned.
"Hi. I would highly recommend Sayulita. It is a magnificent little village that is always well received. Please, however, take necessary precautions to begin and stay well sanitized throughout your visit. Again, as I have posted, I believe (as do many who live here) that this virus is brought down here from travelers. So stay germ free (on the plane - in any area you have contact with other people) and be sure to wash your hands here, stay hydrated and don't swim out front (for the time being). This is an absolutely beautiful part of Mexico to visit! Cheers to you and your next journey!"
"Bucerias, La Cruz, San Pancho, all good choices near PV."
"If it's a virus brought down by travellers, there would be sickness at every resort. Well, that isn't happening. It's a Sayulita problem."
"Hi, You’re wise to chose not to have your wedding in Sayulita. I’m pretty sure it was my wedding one year ago that you heard about at Villa Amor. 65 of our 70 guest were barfing and pooping themselves as a result. We had the town doctor at our villa for close to 10 hours and he was administering IVs to many of our guests. The week before a bride was so sick she couldn’t make it to her wedding. :( I love the town of Sayulita but until they can get this under control, I would caution you and encourage you to look elsewhere."
Most of our guests stayed at Villa Amor or Hotel Vogue. 65 of the 70 we had at our wedding wound up sick. Norovirus is highly contagious.
"Again Trek stop with the BS. Trying to ignore this problem for your own profit shows what kind of person you are. Someone very young, old or compromised immune system could be in serious trouble in Sayulita. Your BS smells like Sayulita."
"Excuse me, but no one on here, especially me, that I have read is ignoring the problem or saying that there hasn't been a strong case of this virus in Sayulita this season. Instead of being insulting from afar, I would suggest finding something local in your own area to chime in on with your negativity. Those of us who live here are effected, in all areas, by this situation and the town of Sayulita is taking every possible step to alert travelers and to assist with ways to help prevent this from reoccurring. And lastly, the kind of person that I am is one who cares, is well educated on the situation at hand and is actually here dealing with it on a daily basis. And I absolutely cannot tolerate people who get onto these forums to stroke their own egos and narcissistic needs. The people on here, for the most part, are trying to share their experiences and much needed accurate information to those who have questions... Not trying to blame the entire town of Sayulita for a virus that is also effecting the US and Canada at a much higher percent than previous years. The challenge with Sayulita is that it is a small village where a virus can spread much quicker than in larger cities or areas. Period."
I’m here now. I’ve never seen any step taken by the town or any businesses to alert tourists of the problem. Please tell me where I might see such warnings other than on this site.Many business people in town that I have spoken to are in denial. I know that they are working on installing the pipes to pump the treated waste out into the ocean but your summary of the problem is disingenuous at best. Have you taken a stroll by the plant lately. I have and the smell is overpowering. If the town had its act together it would have dealt with this several years ago. It is certainly more important than the large expenditure made building the new entrance road into town from the highway to the new bus terminal. The towns priorities are misguided. I will wait to see if the treatment plant even with the new pipes is up to the test. My history here justifiably makes me less than confident.
"Trek new ID,, and same old..Get with it and Read the many threads/ posts here on the waste issue, it's in the air. many years now.The nerve to say it's brought in by Tourists..."
"I was about to ask if anyone had gotten tested to actually identify the pathogen. So it was confirmed as rotovirus, not norovirus by a lab test? They recommend the vaccine for babies. From the CDC: ""Rotavirus is very stable and may remain viable in the environment for weeks or months if not disinfected"" and ""Infected persons shed large quantities of virus in their stool beginning 2 days before the onset of diarrhea and for up to 10 days after onset of symptoms.""On a side note: I had gotten ill in Mexico (inland) many years ago when I was served dairy that just tasted 'off"". Shortly thereafter I was in bed for 3-4 days with the same symptoms being described in this forum. About 2-3 *years* after recovering from that, I started having digestive issues which no specialist was able to definitively diagnose. I lost too much weight because everything I ate caused pain, bloating, nausea, etc. (with the exception of plain potatoes, beans, and steam cooked vegetables--so that's all I ate for about a year.) And a few years after that weird year I was better, but still not 100%, so I went to a naturopath who suggested I get a stool sample tested (not your simple O&P test, but a DNA test). The report I got back said there was a small amount of inflammation (they do a white blood cell count) and an unidentifiable parasite (they couldn't identify it because there wasn't a close enough relative for the DNA matches!)"
"We go to Sayulita every couple weeks, in fact were there 2 days ago with our grandchildren. We ate, drank, swam and paddle boarded; no one is sick. In fact we have never been sick nor spoken to anyone on the beach vacationing for a week who has ever complained of sickness. We go to the beach by Don Pedro's because I think it is prudent to stay away from where the arroyo empties into the ocean."
"Read my posts earlier this week. Your experience is totally different from mine, my hosts, my hosts family and workers. I’ve been here 3 weeks and am very familiar with the problem."
"Every year:1) People report getting sick2) Locals say they never get sick3) Locals say ""tourists bring it down with them"" 4) Promises are made that the sewer plant is nearly fixedCome back next year to see if anything has changed."
"“In fact we have never been sick nor spoken to anyone on the beach vacationing for a week who has ever complained of sickness.”Sick people in Sayulita are not on the beach, they’re on the toilet!"
"Just returned from a birthday celebration in which all 20 people who traveled there, staying in different houses, contracted norovirus.it's likely."
# 105.Best statement on Forum.Going to quote it..
We got really sick in San Pancho too. They also have sewage problems. These little towns can't handle the amount of tourism and the strain on the sewer and water systems is too much.
"I was a guest at a destination wedding in Sayulita from March 1-4, 2019. Many, many of the guests became ill with what appears to be norovirus.I too became violently ill. I have traveled extensively to Mexico and other Caribbean destinations over the last 25 years. Was in Mexico twice last year and never got sick. I practice excellent handwashing/hygiene, take precautions regarding bottled water and dining choices, etc. etc. Took a month of probiotics prior to the trip. There is no other conclusion but norovirus picked up in the town itself. Think of the myriad of surfaces in this community where sickness can be contracted...the list of possibilities is endless...cross-contamination is happening everywhere. I can't tell you the number of people I saw leaving restrooms without washing hands. Visiting Sayulita means you accept that you will have some degree of illness during or after your visit."
"Just returned home from attending a friend’s wedding in Sayulita. My travel companion became severely ill just 36 hours after we arrived. Now I am very ill 5 days later. We suffered severe diarrhea, blood in our stool, cramps, headache and chills. We were tipped off from another traveler to go straight to a local clinic for an IV and meds as soon as you start to feel ill. The doctors seemed to know this routine very well and the meds they gave my friend to greatly reduce the symptoms. She was fully recovered in about 4 days. About 20+ others who attended to wedding also became ill as well. Those are just the attendees we know about....It’s very sad because it’s a beautiful little town that just seems to be hitting a real rough patch with infrastructure & being able to accommodate its recent boom in popularity. Hopefully things turn around for them soon!"
"Was in Sayulita for a wedding at Villa Valentine in Feb 2019. The entire wedding party and many guests, including my girlfriend and I fell I'll. Our symptoms included upset stomach, cramping abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, body aches and headache. My symptoms started after being there for 4 days. In our lines of work (we are both in healthcare) we frequently take care of patients with life threatening infections and take a high degree of precautions at all times and have never been sick, but both got wrecked by Norovirus. It is extremely contagious and has hit Sayulita hard. Realistically you probably have about a 50% chance of getting sick if you choose to travel there."
"We are currently in Sayulita. 5 of 6 of our group got the sickness days of diarrhea after the second diner out. We ate at Don Diegos. I'm to writing this to bash on Diegos, I don't necessarily feel its their fault. We travel extensively thru south Pacific and Asia as a yacht captain. Every once in a while one of the crew will get a little food poisoning. Here within 2 days most of the group was taken out. As I read these forums they are basically 3 groups of people. Group 1 people who haven't gotten sick and add their experience. Group 2 People who have gotten sick. Group 3 people trying to explain away all of the people in group 2 and being pretty dickish about it. First Sayuita is a super cool little town with a great tourist vibe in it. The beach and area are very nice looking, I really want to like this place but there is not denying certain things. No amount of deflection gets around the fact that the overworked treatment plant dumps nearly untreated sewage into the beach bed if the river. (the rest of the river bed is dry). The City has all sorts of pipe sitting in the river bed waiting to be assembled and drug out into the bay. A backhoe is diggings in the river mouth everyday on this project. The other night the road that crosses the river next t the beach (not bridge) was flooded with a giant pool of black water. People were tying to walk around it cars and carts were driving thru it, which of course spreads what ever is in the pool into the rest of the town. The same holds true when people are swimming and there is a higher fecal content in the water. I'm not saying this is all the time but it's happened in the short time that I have been her so not hard to surmise that it happens quite often. The whole end of the river mouth smells like a port- a- potty. You can see it in the other posts. People are like"" I went swimming but not near the river mouth"". Everyone that is saying that is because it smells like poo poo and put 2+2 = we could be swimming in contaminated water.If it was not a huge issue they wouldn't be working on fixing it. When you read thru all the posts they have been fixing for a long time now. Post 105 cuts straight thru the Group 3 BS and nails it. Or you can look at the most posted topics in this forum. out of 14 recent conversations 12 are about sewage and food poisoning.I hope they do eventually get it fixed because I would be a regular. The town is cool as but you do spin the wheel of chance being here. You don't see any other town with the same constant review/forum references to getting sick. I ignored it because we travel in high risk areas and rarely have issues. Our family get together has unfortunately had to take place within arms length of a nice bathroom."

"I wanted to share that I just returned from Sayulita and contracted Norovirus. Sadly mine hit the day we flew out. The virus can be dormant 24-48 hrs after contracting. I was violently ill in an airplane bathroom. Projectile vomiting, accidents in my pants from essentially explosive uncontrollable diarrhea, abdominal pain so intense you think you’re dying. It is a nasty horrid illness. I required a short hospital stay for IV fluids and medications. As an RN and world traveler the stories of sickness in Sayulita did not detour me in anyway but I did find it interesting I kept hearing about people getting “sick” if they’d been to Sayulita. I took all precautions and then some but still got sick. Norovirus is highly contagious and can live on surfaces for days. You don’t have to swim in the water to get it. Google CDC norovirus to understand the virus. There are many ways to contract the virus and regardless of how careful you are, if you’re in an area that flourishes with the virus you’re at risk. Not everyone in a group may get it because maybe they didn’t touch that one door handle or that one salt shaker, etc. It’s virtually impossible to protect 100% against if you’re in an area with people who have had or have the virus. Even after people recover they are still contagious. Google it. Norovirus sheds for weeks after a person recovers from symptoms. It’s a touchy subject as people who’ve not been sick don’t want any “bad talk”. I personally loved Sayulita and would love to see the sewage issue and overall “Sayulta Sickness” issue resolved. Believe me Norovirus is not just like a typical food poisoning experience. It is NASTY AWFUL. If you’re planning to go to Sayulita just know it’s out there. It’s basically a gamble really, but the odds are mostly in everyone’s favor, since many go and are fine. I figured that would be me! Ha! Some of us in the minority just get the short stick and end up deathly ill for 2-3 days. As for me, not sure when or if I’ll return."
"We have been here 2 days. And my daughter is vomiting. We didn’t swim in the ocean, used hand sanitizer and bottled water. Waiting for the other shoe to drop...."
"Ugh! The other shoe has dropped, exorcist type vomiting for me! Even IF the sewage is out to sea in a month, there will be infected human reservoirs until norovirus season is over. Simple epidemiology."
"THIS IS REAL. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE WARNING PEOPLE AND BRING IN AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST. Our Story: We came with 3 families - total of 10 people. Every person got sick for at least 2 days - mixture of vomit, diarrhoea. Now my youngest is sick a second time (I'm sitting beside her in bed typing this - she's been down for 48 hours - very sad way to spend a vacation). I also know of another family of 3 that came down in November and they too got ill. In addition to this, I recommended the place to a friend and his wife for January and he got sick. For the record - we are staying at a very nice place that is cleaned daily. I love this town and have been a good ambassador - sending many people its way. However, this needs to be addressed. The town can not avoid the truth in numbers. We will not be back. Nor can I recommend the town until they bring in a specialist in disease prevention to declare the town safe."
"I’m here in Sayulita now and 8 of the ten people in our group have severe vomiting, fever, chills and diarrhea. I will never ever come here again. Save yourself and stay away!!!"
Ongoing for years and years.Sad children are even taken there.Look out for Easter Infux..
Just returned from a week-long trip to Sayulita with a friend. We both became violently ill on the second day and remained ill throughout our stay. The three women in the unit above us also became ill. I've had norovirus in the past and my symptoms were the same. It seems impossible to avoid despite the best of precautions. My advice is stay away until they are able to get this outbreak under control.
We are heading down next week and our plan was to just use our villa as our home base and travel north and south doing day trips every day. What are your thoughts on avoiding sickness this way?
bean...please let us know how you fared ...
"Just finishing a two week stay in Sayulita. It is a beautiful town with very friendly people who who depend on the tourism industry for their livelihood. It is of course in their interest to say this problem is coming from outside. Our group of five have all been very sick while here. We ar nervous about swimming in the ocean. Everyone we seem to talk to has been sick with similar symptoms: nausea, vomiting, serious diarrhea. The fact that people continue to experience this makes me wonder where the problem originates. This is a health issue that will cost Sayulita dearly if it is not addressed. I’m no expert, so I won’t speculate. However, I would be wary of returning after what we’ve been through. That’s sad because it is really beautiful here!"
"I'm sorry everyone is getting sick. It was my fear before coming here and since arriving I've spent 3.5 of the 5 days I've been here in bed trying to recover. I'm an experienced traveler, 2-3 months a year, travel all over the world, Asia, Europe, Central America, I've been really sick four times while traveling, three times while in Sayulita in only 35 says of being here, and incebin thailand. Out of a total of probably 50 months of travel in the past fifteen years. To the locals who hate the bad press and say it's the airplanes or random other things I say baloney. I just went to El espresso and heard a local from vancoucer who lives here telling a friend that he bumped into, who is also sick, that he's been sick three times in ten days."
"This is so condescending to people that don’t have means to “live in paradise year round” and spend their precious money and PTO on a vacation wherein they spend the majority of their time worshipping an unfamiliar toilet and requiring emergency medical care ina foreign country and are looked down upon by locals who view this as a “right of passage.” For my precious time and money I’d rather not become horribly, emergently ill from a known, unaddressed public health issue."
"Update from my side..... I have been here 4 days, on the third morning I began throwing up but I had a heavy night with the tequila so thought it was just a hangover, although on the fourth day now and still throwing up so it’s either the worst hangover ever or I have caught something.Met a couple today, they were both very sick for a day and then 3 days of unpleasantness.I was one of these people who thought you had to be unlucky to catch it and I would be fine but seems you have to be very very lucky not to catch it"
"Mark ,pretty sad.That's what we have been warning people about for years.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review…"
Welcome to Sayulita. I noticed where you are from and I’m from Johannesburg.
Sorry to hear that you caught the bug Mark. I hope your flight is not too difficult for you.
Thought we could avoid getting sick but no - vomiting and diarrhea for the whole family. If I could make the decision all over again would not have come.
"Add an additional six to the list of people taken down by the Norovirus. Kids and adults of all ages - it was a miserable week and now that we know it's an actual epidemic, we're really disappointed that none of the hotel/AirBNB people have the humanity to warn you.While in the pharmacy (many times), I met other vacationers who were collecting drugs for their mates/families/friends - they all had equally horrid tales to tell. We six experienced violence from all orifices and have lingering weakness and headaches as souvenirs now that we're back home. We cut our vacation short and flew home after meeting a woman who had been ill for weeks. Yuk.If you have options, opt out of Sayulita. It's a lovely town but I think it will take years to detox the place such that we'll ever feel safe enough to go again."
"Heidi,Sorry to hear your group was also impacted as ours was. Incredible that business owners will knowingly keep quiet as they cash your check and send you to your inevitable misery.See my post a few days ago titled ""Extreme Measures Needed for Sayulita Epidemic"". Meant partly as an extremist conversation starter, I actually think any plan substantially less that will fail to effect real change.Edited: 1 year ago "
It does....after spending money...and it was a big birthday trip. I got sick then horribly worried our 10 year old daughter and my husband would. Needs to have a lot of press around this for sure!
I agree!!!! Same here and I got extremely ill. So not worth it!
I totally agree. Big birthday trip....every night at dinner heard horror stories about people getting sick. Day 3...that was me. Been home over a week and just now feeling ok...won’t be back!!!
Agree!
So unfortunate! Especially when spending your holiday money and time only to get ill and then leaves a bad taste in your mouth figuratively and literally! Won’t be back
Exactly! Every night at dinner we ran into people saying they knew someone or they had been sick...then I got sick. Soooo disappointing and so not worth it. I remember overhearing some expats talking and one couldn’t believe the guy only changed his sheets once a week! She said...what ... you’ll get sick and he said...noooo...I haven’t been sick....riiiggghhhttt!
"Oh sorry to hear that!!!! I got violently ill and so glad my husband and 9 year old didn’t. But, they did feel crappy after we got home...just upset tummies thank god!!!"
Never again for us too!
"What are you talking about??? We heard every night at dinner about groups or people being ill, then bag...I got it...no fun after spending your vacay money...this needs to be publicized. 1 1/2 weeks later and a trip to the doc and I am just now feeling normal. Bork iris can really mess you up for s long time. Yes there are pharmacies but you shouldn’t have to seek out meds on your vacation. The way I was sick I thought about babies and the elderly who would have a much more difficult time overcoming this. Thanks...no thanks Sayulita!!!!"
"Sharfraser, one post will do. Nine posts is overkill. Sorry to hear you also got sick. Epidemic."
"Sharon,Shari. Welcome to the Forum, please read the Guidelines as you type a post. And Two profiles are NOT allowed."
"It's NOT the food! It's that the sewage runs in through the town! Think about it, people with norovirus or rota virus or ecoli or all three, poop & puke in the toilet, that waste runs into the river which runs through the town into the ocean untreated! Voila! , the virus is now in the river, through the town into the ocean. It's in the dirt, the air, the surfaces etc. your chances of getting it from just being there are quite high because of this. If you still want to go, boost your immune system & gut bacteria. You still won't be totally safe but it can't hurt!Edited: 1 year ago "
"We went to Sayulita for a Wedding March 28 - April 1st, 2019. We had read about the possibility of the Norovirus being present, so we were extra careful about hand washing, what we ate, drank, etc. In spite of this, when we returned home, we and others from the wedding who had stayed there, became ill. I had the worst stomach upset I have ever had, along with aches, hot/cold flashes, etc. We could smell the sewer when we walked through the town. I would never go back to Sayulita even if they do get their ""sewer"" system fixed. If you already have reservations there, I would recommend that you just drink bottled beer. That's what the only person who didn't get sick drank. Any drink made with ice may be made from local water, so no Margaritas!"
Your bloody lucky.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review…
"I totally agree with you, Jordan S! I felt like our trip (4-2/8-19) was soured by these forums. Some of our party of 8 (4 adults, 4 kids 8 and under) were so freaked out that we almost didn't even go. That would have been such a shame! Because of the worry, we avoided eating in Sayulita, and certainly didn't swim there. We did stay there and traveled to the neighboring towns each day and had a great time. We cleaned and sanitized our rooms when we arrived (and declined maid service when we were there). We were super cautious about hand washing and actually brought hand spray that kills noro that we would use frequently. I feel as though it was overkill, but these threads made us so stressed, we didn't want to take chances. I am so glad we went, and I would absolutely go again. None of us got sick at all."
"We stayed at Villa Amor March 24-30, 2019 4/4 of us got violently ill vomiting and diarrhea. My husband and I are both physicians and we practiced the upmost care with hand washing, drinking bottled water, no ice etc. and we all got sick after the first day. They dump all their sewage into the ocean of the public beach. The bacteria ppm is 180. The US closes beaches when the bacteria is 35ppm. Norovirus is unavoidable. We spoke to people on our snorkeling tour and everyone got sick. There is an epidemic in Sayulita which the hotels and tourism tries to hide and deny. This is criminal. Our trip was so bad not only will we NEVER return to Sayulita, We will NEVER return to Mexico either. There are so many cleaner and more beautiful beaches to visit in the world."
"Still happening, our family of four got hit 24-48 hours after visiting. My husband and son got it on the plane. They were so sick they almost had to divert the plane for us and we we're escorted through customs by paramedics. I can only hope we didn't unwittingly pass it to our fellow passengers. I always over research everything but I've been trying to be more laid back, so I didn't look up forums on Syulita. Whoops."
