"In order to avoid a dozen different threads I thought I would start a general one on this topic. There are two confirmed cases in NYC so far. One was a health care worker who recently came back from Iran and who is isolated in her home with her husband and avoided public transportation. The second case is a Westchester man who traveled to Israel and Miami, who is hospitalized in Manhattan. These are the only two cases that are confirmed in NY at this time. Feel free to add to this thread any attractions that get closed down in NYC or impacts of the virus on people coming through the airports/transit hubs or any other things that would impact a visitor's trip. There are over 8 million people in NYC alone and over 20 million in the NY metropolitan area, so keep that in mind when looking at the number of confirmed cases."
"From what I understand, we have all had one or another of a corona virus at some point in time as it is the newest strain of an upper respiratory virus & even the new strain can be so mild that people don't bother going to the doctor or it can be deadly. You should take the appropriate cautions for any sort of upper respiratory virus & monitor any upper respiratory virus especially one that seems severe. At this point in time, I'm not going to stress out if I come across someone who coughs or sneezes near me but just make certain I monitor my own health without stressing about what I can't do much about.Edited: 3:31 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Not to mention the fact that in his press conference this afternoon the Mayor advised you CANNOT catch COVID19 from riding public transit like the Metro North commuter trains (which latest victim rode from New Rochelle to work in Manhattan) OR NYC subway. Mayor says has to be sustained ""close"" contact, and they are testing guy's wife.Of course, Twitter immediately filled with laughter, as folks compared mayoral ""info"" with just released video of transit workers doing extra shifts to ""disinfect"" trains and stations."
"I had the misfortune to had to have been rushed to the hospital Friday and noticed on my way into the ER that a man was unpacking isolation suits. So, places are preparing for the worst. Of course, Flushing has many people who come and go from China."
OMG Fox - I hope you are OK.
"Yes, I hope Fox is okay too.It's good to know they have their Hazmat gear in Flushing. I heard today that some workers at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville have had to be quarantined because when the most recent victim, from New Rochelle. decided to seek medical care he apparently just went to that ER, which was evidently not prepared for him in sense they had protective gear or even any expertise in this area. They assessed him and had him transferred to Columbia Presbyterian in Washington Heights, which IS prepared to handle this type of case.So I suggest if you think you have this, to avoid wasting time, call and talk to someone before you go to the wrong hospital.Edited: 5:41 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"""Not to mention the fact that in his press conference this afternoon the Mayor advised you CANNOT catch COVID19 from riding public transit like the Metro North commuter trains"" - That would be a total lie if he said that. Of course you can catch it on the train."
Apparently. no one explained to Bill about community spreadIIRC is is airborne and might also be transmitted on surfaces https:/…transmission.html
Bill isn't the sharpest pencil in the bunch.The MTA is cleaning subway cars and other areas every few days.
"I am on Amtrak now. The train stinks from the cleansing fluid. But then again, it usually does. Yuck. I have never washed my hands so often and so zealously as I did today. I need a new hand cream."
@#9 I have been washing my hands too and even doing it in a very deliberate way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IisgnbMfKvI
"Thanks for reopening this, TA."
An article about how NYC is prepared for the coronavirus and how these things get handled if it progresses. https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/how-…
"There is now a third confirmed case of the virus in NY a yeshiva university student. They have not confirmed the identity but there is the strong chance that this person is the son of the second victim, because his son attended that university and had been showing symptoms."
Its confirmed that the third case is indeed the son of the man who is the second case. Not really surprising that it passed between family members who live together.
"Three additional confirmed cases in New York all connected to the midtown lawyer. His daughter, his wife and his neighbor all have it."
As of the Gov's most recent briefing this afternoon there seem to be at least 11 confirmed cases in NYC area.
"Actually, the Mayor could have more news, as I believe a state lab and a city lab are testing different people, as of yesterday or today."
@16 some of your information is wrong or at least not corroborated yet. For example heat doesn't kill a virus. That is a myth and a doctor would know that. Warmer weather can impact transmission rates but at this point it is only speculation if this will be the case with the coronavirus. Nobody knows the answer yet. Below is a FAQ from Harvard medical school that is a better source to rely on.https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/as-coron…
"Further to Nora's excellent tips, I'd add.1. Sing Happy Birthday twice while washing your hands,2. Avoid using your fingers in public surfaces, (ie elevator buttons etc) use your key, pen etc.3. Bring your own pens/stylus for use when signing cc receipts, etc,4. Don't touch your face"
When posting news of new cases please provide any additional info that you can. I know sometimes they dont give much info. For example if the infected person was a relative of someone else who has it and has been in isolation the whole time or if the person just came back from overseas that is less alarming than cases of local transmission where the infected person was all over mass transit for days.the better informed people are the less likely they are to panic.
"“”some of your information is wrong or at least not corroborated yet.””I absolutely agree with the fact that higher temperatures may or, most likely, may not help the world getting rid of this virus. At this point, it is not known and I do not think it will help us anyways simple because warm temperatures will not happen in the nearest future."
In terms of the 9 new coronavirus cases in NY. All of them have been traced back to that one lawyer. They were people who either spent significant time with him or close relatives of people who did.
"The reason colds are more common in winter is often because windows are closed because of the cold and there is less fresh air. Breathing air in an enclosed space such as a plane, train, elevator, etc. can spread the disease. UV in sunlight can kill many pathogens as it damages their genetic material, but not all pathogens.."
"***I have never washed my hands so often and so zealously as I did today. I need a new hand cream.***I wash my hands quite often under normal conditions. As of late, I'm doing it even more than normal."
"If you over wash your hands so that the skin cracks, you are making matters worse. Soaking your hands in 10% bleach for 10 mins. would probably be the most effective thing, but that would be very bad for your skin and no one should do this."
"Some viruses spread easier in the winter because 1. Due to the cold people are indoors in close proximity to each other vs being outside and spread out and 2. The cold dry air allows viruses to float in the air easier so that they can spread person to person, when the air is warm and humid the viruses are often down near the ground and therefore not as likely to reach nasal passages etc. Different viruses behave in different ways but those are some of the reasons for seasonal viruses."
@26 I read somewhere that excessive hand sanitizer is also a problem. Everything in moderation. When I go into the hospital they have those hand sanitizer stations and I likely use them more than I should.
"I’m not these are all confirmed facts yet. I think we have to avoid repeating beliefs as fact and rely on experts for advice. But at any rate, common sense should apply and would help in any bad flu season eg good hand washing, coughing into your elbow etc."
"Re #29 I have been thinking about that. If you look at China, I'm not sure but think it existed at least in early December. They sort of kept it under wraps until Jan or so and I guess was maybe mid Jan when they got really serious and started locking cities down. I believe new cases are declining there and most new cases these days are outside China. When it will be gone there, I don't know. Maybe a couple more months? When will US State Dept.lift warning on travel to China, I don't know. Will course of the illness here be as severe a China? I don't know. Would hope it would be gone here by summer, but if it is as bad as China, it might not. Plus if is bad and other countries issue warnings against travel here,decision might not be yours."
"Also, don't know if there is gen'l vibe here, but some people seem cool and others freaking out.In some ways reminds me of period during 1st Gulf War, when there were rumors Saddam Hussein was going to attack us with missiles or something similar and there was belief we all needed duct tape on our windows and people were running around emptying shelves of duct tape. Is similar now, except is hand sanitizer they are all going for."
Too much hand sanitizer also makes your immune system more vulnerable by stripping away germs. Exposure to germs is what builds immunity.
"#33 - exactly what I always tell my husband... but I guess now it is the right time to use sanitizers and hand creams... I really hate all these sanitizers.Edited: 5:51 pm, March 04, 2020 "
#34- Toilet paper? Is the a real shortage for some reason? Import issues?Luckily here we have thoughtful adult legislators who behave with decorum to reassure people when voting on virus funding https://thehill.com/homenews/house/486013-ga…
"1000 people now quarantined in Westchester, a few miles from nyc. 11 cases in nyc. This is changing every few hours."
"I read somewhere that March/April will be the peak for the virus in USA. The toilet paper thing in Sydney perplexes me. Is it because they think they may need be quarantined at home for a few weeks so want to have a big stock of everything? Or is it because they feel that toilet paper supplies are being sent over to China to fill their need (like baby formula currently) so want to keep a large supply at home now before that happens. Not sure which it is, but it's panic buying."
Toilet paper was also an issue in Hong Kong. There was even an incident of toilet paper theft.
"People are nicking TP from public toilets, schools and workplaces.That people are stock piling TP is just plain selfish....what about those who have no reserves of $$$$$$ to buy in advance....the shelves are empty....TP is made here in OZ.And people who are stock piling TP and beans are just plain dumb....."

"The numbers will certainly go up as they test. The simple way to think about this is that we can't control what happens. We can only control how we react to it. Panic does no good for anybody and while this is more serious than the flu it is hardly the plague. Maybe this will serve as a wakeup call to countries around the world about the need to develop adequate systems to handle these issues. Because the next virus might kill in much greater numbers. I don't see 8 million new yorkers agreeing to sit in their homes for two weeks under lockdown and besides its too late for that. Just like China and their delays allowed it to spread across china and around the world. Plenty of blame to go around for this, but other than some potentially annoying disruptions I don't see this having a major impact on NYC day to day life.Edited: 8:59 pm, March 04, 2020 "

If they can't leave the house (or hotel) or need to take extra precautions when out, that is a major impact. Not to mention the stress and added fear for them. That's major."
"""Except for those people who will be at a major risk if they contract the virus,"" agreed if they contract the virus that is certainly true. I'm skeptical we will see such an extreme outbreak concentrated in NYC that those people would need to confine themselves to home, which is the point I was trying to make. Maybe they take car service instead of mass transit or they skip large indoor gatherings. In general the vast majority of people will attempt to go about their lives as always."
"I have not read anywhere that COVID-19 in NY would peak in March or April, and I have been following this fairly closely for 6-8 weeks. Actually, it's only just gotten started here, at least in terms of formal recognition, and I don't think anyone has a good idea yet how bad, or not, it will be.The only reference I have heard or read to either month and COVID-19 was out of the mouth of the President of the United States, when he said the virus would go away in April when the weather warmed up. This may have been the same time he compared it to a cold, or perhaps the time he suggested there was nothing to worry about since there were only 15 cases. Of course, the clip about going away in April is rerun practically nightly on late night TV (to great guffaws).Edited: 11:35 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"OK, I have accidently ( and timely) come across the article where I read the March / April thing again. (I knew it definitely wasn't from the POTUS). The article did mention March / April but the word they used was ""widespread"" rather than ""peak"". So my memory mixed up the context and I thought it was peak rather than widespread.So I guess nobody knows yet when it will peak.https://gothamist.com/news/detailed-coronavi…Written by Dr James Robb, ""one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses"" I would put some credence on his expertise. It's an interesting article in that he recommends sucking on zinc lozenges, as well as the other known recommendations.Info about the author: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Robb_(pathologist)"
So I would really appreciate an idea of what the impact of this pandemic is having on access to places that tourists might like to go...eg museums/ libraries/theatres....I'm due to arrive in NYC on 28/3 for a week with my son. I'm a GP so have a good idea / perspective of the virus - but I'm a little concerned that our activities will be limited when there. I'm also aware that this will continue to evolve but would appreciate some updates every now and again from those who are on the ground there. Thanks.

"At the moment, there's no impact. Nothing (which locals use, at least) is closed; life goes on as normal. But as you know, this has been a fast moving situation.Edited: 6:46 am, March 05, 2020 "
"I’m a local who will be doing tourist things today and through the weekend (museums, theater, restaurants) and will report back. So far the biggest impact is bare shelves in the Park Slope Food Coop, leading me to wonder who these people *are* who have pantries and freezers big enough to store food."
"They're the people who bought houses in the '90s, Linda! I know a few of them. They seem like totally normal humans and then you see they're living in what now would be six million dollars of real estate, and they're all bashful like, um, we just bought this in 1993 for $40k?FWIW I have been grocery shopping and taking out food here in Queens and you wouldn't know anything odd was going on."
"Haha, jhwanderer, I know that’s true of many people (including folks on my block, and some close friends)...but I also know there’s an ungodly amount of money sloshing around Park Slope these days. I just think it’s weird/funny that the (organic, free range, grass-fed) meat case at the coop was completely bare on Tuesday, and the freezer section severely depleted.Stores in more working class/immigrant areas seem normal, so maybe the panic buying is just happening in a narrow demographic."
NJ now has a case from a Fort Lee resident. The patient is in Hackensack Hospital. This patient has a direct connection to the person from Westchester County. https:/…Few more cases in the city have also surfaced.

"I've been receiving emails from friends on advice they've gotten. This arrived this morning and sounded sensible although I'm not an expert to say whether it's accurate.“The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days, so it’s hard to know if someone Is infected. By the time someone has fever and/or cough and goes to to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late. ** Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. - Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it shows there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection. Please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air. - Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe. “I've also just posted a thread suggesting people check their hotel pricing if coming in the next few months. If people cancel their trips, hotels may drop rates to fill rooms."

"NYU Hospital has instructed its staff not to attend any event with more than five people. This is super annoying to me as one of their docs is supposed to speak at an event I am part of co-hosting. It is supposed to be held at the auditorium of another NYC hospital and they are contemplating cancelling because they aren't supposed to be hosting large events. This is totally irritating me (I would like to use stronger language, but...). So, some events are starting to be cancelled. I would confirm any lectures at private institutions or universities for which you may have tickets. I would be surprised if big profit making events are cancelled...but the low dollar or free events are at risk.Please note that NYU didn't send me a copy of their policy directly.

"I can see hospitals taking extra (arguably excessive) precautions, since their personnel are in direct or indirect contact with medically vulnerable people. I’m curious if non-medical institutions are contemplating similar things. It does suck that your event is in jeopardy. Sorry to hear that."
And such a cool event too. So upset! Thanks Linda!I don't know how you can keep personnel from attending any event with more than five people...that would mean some family events too. That's very hard on staff.
"@67 yep I agree with you. If a doctor or nurse brings the virus into a hospital the results would be tragic not to mention the staffing shortage that would result. Five seems like an odd number though. In terms if other companies I think we see that if the numbers increase significantly. I know in Asia etc lots of tradeshows got canceled and government started pushing companies to have workers telecommute.

"I'm not looking for basic hygiene tips on coronavirus. I live in the SF Bay area where there are cases too, so I'm well versed. We are scheduled to come to NYC this weekend. My son's band will be performing at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday. My question is, what's the city like right now? Is it business as usual or a ghost town? Are people still in museums, restaurants, bars, stores? I'm trying to decide whether to go or cancel. The band is still going at this point. Like I said, I could be exposed to it here where there are cases too and we haven't stopped our activities, so I don't want to overreact and miss my son in Carnegie Hall!Thoughts?"
"I was at the armory show at the piers yesterday and it was packed. It will only get more packed over the weekend. Thousands of people from all around the world. New York goes on. No one was handshaking. They were elbow bumping. And there was purell in evidence. Other than that, people keep living."
"Re #54 - I haven't heard about any closings -- like at museums, tourist sites, etc.Some meetings, gatherings, speeches may be canceled, but I don't think most of those affect tourists. Only closings I have heard of so far are schools and houses of worship connected in one way or another to people with the virus.It is possible, as time passes and number of cases increases, that there will be closings or more limited hours, if for no other reason than dropping attendance as people choose to avoid crowds, but haven't heard of any yet.As of midday today, about 24 people diagnosed as positive. Four of those in New York City, one in neighboring New Jersey, and the rest apparently in neighboring southern Westchester County.Some businesses may be changing their operating procedures. For example, I know Starbucks has switched to paper cups only, telling people to leave reusable cups at home. And don't be surprised if some businesses take cards only, no cash."
"It does not feel business as usual to me. Stock market gyrations causing anxiety in a finance heavy city, some school closings, some events cancelled, study abroad kids coming home, companies talking work at home, empty shelves in Drug stores, Yoga class cancelled. Many modifying their travel plans. Maybe I’m just more sensitive? Just a single data point. I am still flying out of jfk within the next day. I can post from airport."
"#71. If you're still going about your business in San Francisco, then go about it here.I was at the ballet last week and had germs on my mind, but the crowd seemed normal. However it is possible that would be a different case this week with so many cases diagnosed in the interim (fortunately for the ballet, their season ended Sunday, so they don't have to worry about it for a couple more months). I was in a Starbucks last night where the crowd seemed less than normal, but I'm not sure why that was and frankly thought it was a good thing. I am starting to think twice about crowded places, especially if going there is not necessary, and assume others do too. But I do not expect big changes between now and the weekend.Make sure you bring your own hand sanitizer, etc. as it is difficult to find right now. I assume that at some point they will be able to restock, but now is not a good time to buy such things."

Board week at my husband’s company this week and they still flew in staff from all over the country and are hosting a dinner for hundreds of employees. Have the big restaurant show at the javitz center this weekend and that’s still going on so far as I’ve heard. In my world, everything seems normal and nothing’s been canceled or disrupted. So, don’t expect a ghost town for sure. The only change I’ve seen is hand sanitizer out in every building I walk into. If not for news and chatter, I’d be none the wiser. Talk of the dog park this AM was people debating canceling their spring break trips. Seems like no one is afraid to travel but are afraid of their kids missing 2 weeks of school if the [private] schools put out a quarantine mandate."
"My family works in media/entertainment so that’s my POV. NYC Upfront cancelations, movie opening postponed, concerts cancelled (not nyc but Miami, and all of Asia). I read that broadway has not seen a hit. Interested in others first hand observations."
That's the funny (?) thing. Now I don't worry as much about being there though the flight is a little nerve wracking. There's no way out there! I'll sanitize the sh*# out of everything I'm near but there's not much else I can do. Sounds like we'll have a good time! Thanks for the updates!

With the help of a special kind of blood test, better numbers are on the way.The issue is not that health agencies can’t count, but that in the heat of an epidemic, patients with mild or no symptoms do not seek treatment, aren’t immediately identified, and therefore aren’t counted as survivors in calculating fatalities.The blood screening that will provide better estimates is called a serologic test, which allows researchers to identify people who were infected with a virus weeks after they recoverThat is different from the kind of rapid testing that takes place during an epidemic, when samples from suspected patients (in this case, nasal swabs) are tested for the virus itself.https:/…"

Chelsea Market was bustling - perhaps not as crowded as usual, but I consider that a good thing, as we were able to get our Very Fresh Noodles with just a short wait, and even find a place to sit, at peak lunch hour. Walked a bit of the High Line - not mobbed, but not a ghost town, either - and then went to the Whitney to see the “Vida Americana” exhibit, which was fabulous. Galleries weren’t mobbed (do galleries at the Whitney ever get mobbed? not sure), so we could take our time and enjoy the art.Hope this is informative/reassuring."

"Some staff members at my former employer came across someone who had the virus and they were ordered to stay home in quarantine. They have no symptoms, so I would guess most of those people who are in quarantine are there out of an abundance of caution because I think they would hospitalize symptomatic people instead of having them sit home.Edited: 7:11 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"So when you're in quarantine in your own home do you have to stay in your apartment? Can you go to the mail room, laundry room, gym, use the elevator, etc? If so, are other residents in the building told there is a quarantined person in the building?"
"There was a case in New Hampshire over the weekend where a resident at the Dartmouth medical center who had recently returned from some hot spot like Italy or S Korea was told to quarantine and was tested for virus, but results not in before weekend. So guy went out to a big ""mixer"" with Dartmouth biz school over weekend at nearby bar in Vermont. Monday the results come in and he is positive and now they have to notify all those people, shut down bar, etc."
"Quarantine means you don't go out of your front door.As to informing the residents of the building, that's up to the Building Management. Prudence indicates they should. Good neighbours can also be helpful, ie leaving groceries, your mail, etc by your front door."
"Frankly, if someone in my building were quarantined I would want to know. Don't really need to know specifics, like name, but if these people are not restricted in their movements I might take extra precautions when returning from laundry room, etc. Well I guess that's just one more time when I need to remember to wash my hands when I return to the apt."
@95 If someone is in a large apartment building I would assume they tell people to stay in their own apartment otherwise the whole building is put at risk and those other neighbors are allowed to go out so that would defeat the whole purpose.
"Maybe it's different here than in UK but I saw video on BBC showing what ""self quarantine"" or ""self isolation"" means there and I have not heard anything similar here. Among other things, there you have to double bag in big plastic bags your household waste and leave outside door for special pickup separate from other building trash. Deliveries have to be left outside your door, then after delivery person leaves you can open door and take it inside."
"Good place for this thread to end....Conjecture, theory, false panic, all fueled by media-hype.This too will end!"

"Marianne. not sure why you are trying to beat a dead horse here. I said people shouldn't post MEDICAL ADVICE without citing proper medical authority because doing so is frankly dangerous. In terms of my response that you are quoting I am not talking about medical advice, I am in fact talking about specific information that I have personal knowledge of from people who were told to stay in quarantine and I am indicating that I am guessing that many of the other people in quarantine were told the same thing about staying home."
"If nothing else, I wish people would stop using the phrase ""out of an abundance of caution."" Ever heard of ""just to be on the safe side,"" ""just to be careful,"" ""call me OCD"" and a number of other phrases? This stupid phrase is getting as tired, overused and boring as ""thoughts 'n prayers,"" and that's pretty extreme (as one relative of a shooting victim recently shrieked: ""I don't want your lousy thoughts 'n prayers"")."

Seth Meyers responds to our president's take on the virus:https://www.thedailybeast.com/seth-meyers-ri…
"""Today's press conference from NY Gov. Cuomo"" The whole thing just felt like a very New Yorker way to explain stuff. ROFL It was a good press conference. The media whips up a lot of hysteria with their ominous music playing in the background. This press conference just lays out what is going on and what steps they are taking and is worth watching."
I just happened to turn on the movie World War Z. Probably not the best thing to watch if you already have anxiety about the coronavirus. Heh
Don't worry you're more likely to be hit by a cyclist on the Brooklyn Bridge or a crosswalk in NYC than catching this virus.Just wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds and don't cough or sneeze on anyone.Just confirmed earlier today that there's now 11 cases here in Scotland.
"""Just wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds ...""At first, I found the videos on ""how"" to wash your hands so ridiculous...until yesterday.I stopped in at Cafeteria on 7th and 17th for an hour before meeting someone at the Scope Art Fair (where no one was shaking hands). I went straight downstairs to the big open sink between the men's room and the women's room to wash ""the city"" off my hands before touching (delicious) chick pea fritters. A guy came out of the men's room, rinsed briefly, shook the water, didn't dry, and went upstairs. What's with people? SOAP, LATHER, CLEAN EVERY FINGER, RUB VIGOROUSLY, RINSE, DRY CAREFULLY. How have people missed all of this? It's everywhere!"
"Risa, if you think that's bad, there's a Instagram post of a rather well dressed gentleman, tasting the soups (and other fare) at a Whole Foods hot food section. What are people thinking????"
""" A guy came out of the men's room, rinsed briefly, shook the water, didn't dry, and went upstairs. What's with people?"" -That guy may have only rinsed his hands because you saw him there. Its shocking how many people walk out of restrooms without attempting to wash at all."
"We are in Truro on Cape Cod, MA right now. There has just been confirmation of a significant occurrence (90 cases so far) in Boston at a biotech conference there. I have heard that the Boston medical community is now recommending cancelling all gatherings of over 250 people for the foreseeable future. We went into the local Stop and Shop, where the pharmacy was allowing one tiny pocket-sized bottle of Purel per customer, with no large refill bottles available. This is a town where the winter population is well under 2,000. Quite remarkable. But no one seems particularly concerned. I'm being more careful about hand-washing, but otherwise not worried. Yet."
Local media in Boston is reporting five cases from this conference. Where did you hear 90? That’s a big difference. https:/…
I'm surprised Boston has the ability to test 90 people.
"Birthdaygirl, NYU has restricted their medicalPersonnel to events w no more than 5 people, or they have to self quarantine for two weeks. The Cornell/NYP restriction is 25 people. These are internal decisions, not government requirements."
Yes the most recent media reports indicate 5 people with confirmed cases from that conference. There like 8 confirmed cases total for all of Mass.
"***Its shocking how many people walk out of restrooms without attempting to wash at all.***Fully agree, but it happens often enough.This is a great example of how people take for granted touching their face and such:https:/…1235252608845197314"
"Definitely, we do not have 90 cases in Boston. Here is the most recent update from Boston’s chief of health and human services, Marty Martinez. https:/…3famp"
"I guess I got it wrong, luckily. It was 90 people in the hospital with symptoms, but since they can’t test them all I guess only some were confirmed. My son who is an infectious disease physician tells me that all medical conferences have been canceled nationwide. He was supposed to present at one in a few weeks. Many universities are refusing to pay for international travel, and only for essential domestic travel, for conferences or meetings. It’s crazy."
Those who imagine the virus will disappear with warmer weather should look at the outbreak map with cases and spread in tropical countries.
"***if you think that's bad, there's a Instagram post of a rather well dressed gentleman, tasting the soups (and other fare) at a Whole Foods hot food section. What are people thinking????***I am not a big fan of the hot/cold bars at Whole Foods, or any of the other stores, etc. People grab things with their fingers and do all kinds of things that are disgusting. Speaking of grabbing food with your fingers, check out this video:https:/…1234945200268685313"
"Basically everyone needs to play their part to stop the spread no matter where they are. Hand washing major one and all parts of hands, no quick rinse&drip dry.

"Re# 121: I am hardly Hygiene's poster child, but even I have limits. One thing that has always surprised/amazed me is what people do (or not) after using cardio equipment at the gym - guys in particular. They take a wipe and wipe the seat! The seat ! It's not like they've been biking in the nude and the next person will too. What about the handlebars and other parts they have touched with their HANDS? Yes, the hands that were on their you know whats when they went to the bathroom upon arrival at the gym, which hands were probably poorly washed, if washed at all. I used to think about this more in terms of the spread of hepatitis than a corona virus. I got so mad one day I pointed it out to a guy who had just gone through the motions of wiping his seat. He became enraged and yelled at me that the NY subway was dirtier than that bike. I'm sure, and maybe the filth of the subway, if not the general filth of NYC, is why some people exhibit such poor personal hygiene habits. In any event, like a previous poster, I now thoroughly wipe down my equipment both before AND after workouts (especially thoroughly before). Frankly, I'm surprised we haven't heard more about gym hygiene from public health officials."
SXSW (in Austin TX) cancelled https://www.sxsw.com/2020-event-update/
""" Frankly, I'm surprised we haven't heard more about gym hygiene from public health officials."" Sales of peloton bikes have been going up quite a bit as a result of people avoiding the gym out of worries about the virus. Maybe the gym will finally be less crowded."
"My gym (Boston Sports Club) is obviously not in NYC and they sent an email to the members about what they are doing and what we are supposed to do. Less crowded today, but it is never crowded anyway. What drives me nuts is that those who wipe the machines leave the wipes everywhere instead of disposing them properly. I will talk to our manager tomorrow. Have not heard anything about proper gym hygiene from Boston government officials."
Some additional information from CDC about hand sanitizers. and how washing hands with soap and water can be more effective at times. Also of note look for sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol. https:/…hand-sanitizer-factsheet.pdf

"“ SXSW (in Austin TX) cancelled”Wow. That is the single biggest moneymaker of the year for Austin. The hospitality, restaurant, and bar industries will be hurt badly.

"And for anyone travelling to NYC soon, check your travel insurance for coverage of cancellation costs of airfares, hotels etc. Most say they don't cover you if you cancel just out of ""fear"" but if the US puts an Arrival restriction or ban on your flight because of where it's coming from, that's a valid cancellation reason.

If you can’t test people how can you rely on the information - do they have Covid19 - don’t know we can’t test them. Should they go to work maybe in healthcare facilities - don’t know we can’t test them. I don’t know how you rely on information which is incomplete. That is what is ridiculous.
"NYTimes Friday:Coronavirus in N.Y.: City Pleads for More Tests as Cases RiseThe city told the federal government that a shortage of tests for the virus had “impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.”New York City officials pleaded in a letter to the federal government on Friday to send more test kits for the new coronavirus, saying that the city’s limited capacity to test for the virus had “impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.”As of noon on Friday, fewer than 100 people had been tested for the coronavirus in New York City over the past month, according to the city’s Department of Health, even as concerns grew that the virus was circulating largely undetected.“I think it’s fair to say we have no idea how many New Yorkers have been infected with this virus without knowing it,” a New York City councilman, Mark Levine, who heads the City Council’s Health Committee, said."
@163 There is a massive difference between a lack of information that has been released and telling people that they can't rely on any information coming out.

We are scheduled to visit NYC mid April. Unfortunately Delta is Only waiving change fees for tickets purchased after March 1?! Seems like those who purchased early are the ones penalized. Makes no sense. Personally I’m not worried for myself...yet... but we were bringing my 75 year old mom who will have just completed chemotherapy. Her oncologist previously encouraged us to go which is why we bought tickets but now I just don’t think it’s smart. Anxious to see what Delta days when I call.
"#167 - I think I'd ask her doctor (for his advice and perhaps a doctors note advising against travel at this time) and then ask the airline to ask about an exception for a medically fragile person. (If they resist ask to speak to a manager. They shouldn't want the bad PR of refusing someone like her)I think (hope) the point that was being made above is to be considerate of the sources of info on the situation.Statements by medical professionals and scientists (which usually include caveats about unknowns and the fluidity of the situation) are different from bureaucrats (from any government) who may have an incentive to put a spin on what is said - like the person who wanted to have the cruise ship off California not dock so the case numbers wouldn't increase https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/20…Edited: 8:33 am, March 07, 2020 "

""" Her oncologist previously encouraged us to go which is why we bought tickets but now I just don’t think it’s smart."" In general I don't think there is a reason to avoid NYC at this point. That being said the CDC is now advising the elderly stay home. If I was in that position I would still be ok travelling to NYC myself. However, I don't think I would bring an elderly parent."
"The Times today had an article about the effects on cultural institutions. Obviously, performances are places with lots of people in close quarters, but so far, no news of cancellations. The article said that the Met had been revising rehearsal schedules because of artists from abroad who may need some sort of quarantine. But the audience there is likely full of tourists, as well as locals. And it sounds like the manager, Peter Gelb, would not cancel anything unless the house was closed by the city. SInce the capacity there is 3,800, much larger that other theaters, there could be real risk. My next tickets are for March 21, and I'm wondering if I really want to go, or if I'm just being paranoid. Mu husband and I are both 71, but in excellent health--no complicating issues. Still . . ."
"#267 The reason Delta and other airlines are having special exchange/refund rights for people who book since 3/1 and not before is just to drum up business, as bookings have fallen off a cliff in the past few weeks, so they are encouraging people not to be afraid of losing money if they later cancel. If you want to cancel/change, I would ask her doc to cooperate by writing note and see if that's good enough to get Delta to let you change without paying. May or may not be."

"What seems to have happened looking at the effects of the virus spread internationally is that when things change regarding infection numbers they can change very quickly which is good in one way because it does help people make up their own mind quickly what they are going to do about travelling or attending big gatherings.I would be loath to take advice from an anonymous online forum on whether one should travel or not in the circumstances.

"The information of people who actually live in NYC is certainly relevant to the current status of the city which is something tourists would want to know when making a decision. Who wants to go to a city if everything is closed? The best source of info is city and state health agencies. The media, depending on the outlet, can get hysterical and don't always base their reporting on actual science which is why official medical sources are best for a real assessment."
"""The information of people who actually live in NYC is certainly relevant to the current status of the city which is something tourists would want to know when making a decision.""Totally agree. I tried to make a last minute dinner reservation for tonight - every place I tried was booked, or the only tables available were before 6 or after 11. (Finally got one at The Clam, which is one of my favorites anyhow.) New Yorkers are certainly not afraid of letting other people prepare their food.The Armory Show at the Piers was PACKED on Wednesday. Scope at the Metropolitan Pavilion was packed on Thursday. Headed to Volta tomorrow. Art fairs are FULL of people (and artworks) that travelled internationally to attend, and somehow, they all got here and while handshaking is being avoided, everyone is still celebrating the art world. People may be cautious (some, not all). But life is going on (the issues are bigger with medical conferences, where health care workers have a higher and more urgent need to avoid contact, hence the stringent rules for medical personnel)."
We should make a drinking game everytime Risa mentions The Clam :) I'm going to The Musket Room going to try red deer I think.

***I am all for people drinking more! ***Alcohol can have a negative effect on ones immune system.
"^^^Well, you can use the extra alcohol in your homemade hand sanitizer. Which begs the question: why is alcohol good in your sanitizer but bad for your internal immune system. ;)"
That's a waste of good liquor.Drinkable liquor doesn't have a high enough alcohol content (unless maybe you can get some high % Everclear)For homemade hand sanitizer you'd need (toxic to drink) isopropyl alcohol.
"experts are saying don't make your own hand sanitiser as getting the proportions right is hard for an effective concoction. They say it can be a fire hazard and the mixture can get contaminated with bacteria, even becoming harmful.Use soap and water."
"I know...60% minimum, but 70% preferred, for hand sanitizer...we're all experts now. I was joking, of course. (although Tito's actually tweeted out that their vodka isn't appropriate for hand sanitizer). I was simply amused that red seems to find it unusual that I mention one restaurant regularly...generally, I can predict on any restaurant thread that certain people will say ""The River Cafe"", someone will say ""Odeon,"" someone will say ""Mercato or Nocello,"" another always says ""The Lamb's Club,"" and someone else always says ""Maialino or Marea."" I ofter wonder how often people actually eat at the places they recommend as I think there is value in being current (I was super disappointed in Maialino the last time I was there, approximately a year ago, and I am not inclined to go back so quickly). I recommend the places I go to regularly because I know they're still good, like Crown Shy which I was at on Wednesday, the place I don't mention on Thursday, and The Clam in a few hours. (Although I actually was at Marea within the last month.) When I want recs, I want to know if the person has actually been there in the last year, otherwise, I can just google myself."

Life goes on, keep your immune system in top shape and look after those that are elderly, etc."
"When I go into the hospital Purrell is what is used. Unlike sanitizers talked about in that article it does not contain triclosan. Also, the alcohol isn't a problem if your not drinking the sanitizer. Soap and water is considered the gold standard when hands are washed properly. The problem is people don't always have access soap and clean water which is where hand sanitizer can come in handy, especially for those of us that spend a of time during the day moving around and interacting with a variety of surfaces. Hand sanitizers are more of a stop gap until we can properly wash. What that article mentioned about the overuse of antibiotics is true and its actually terrifying if you read up on the topic further. Eventually we are going to have to deal that problem or face severe consequences down the line.Edited: 6:05 pm, March 07, 2020 "

"“When I go into the hospital, Purell is what is used.” Let’s be clear about that: Purell is provided to the public with the recognition that people don’t stop in the bathrooms to wash thoroughly. It is not what physicians use before an exam and certainly not for surgery. When they do use it, you can be sure that they’ve already washed, it’s just the extra level of protection after."
Nobody is talking about surgery which has a lot of scrubbing. The nurses and doctors use it before touching patients. It's not there only for the public.
I work in health care and our policy is purell or hand washing (unless there are certain infections like C-diff). Of course when performing surgery the surgeon and OR staff scrub down to maintain a sterile environment but that is different. I touch patients all of the time with just purell as recommended by our infection control staff.
They locked down like a quarter of the Italian population in Northern Italy. Its disconcerting. Places like Milan and Venice.
"Italy gave 2 hours notice of closing down the region where 16 million people live, including in the major financial Centre of Italy. So, a lot of people managed to escape the red zone and if they had the virus they were taking it with them. Close to 6000 people are confirmed to have the virus in Italy. Presumably many more who are undetected."
"Pretty sure they announced it overnight when many were sleeping. Also, where will they really flee to? This wasn't one town this was a very large region. They are going to leave behind their homes and families to live where? I would think if people who had somewhere else to go would have already left the area.Edited: 4:58 am, March 08, 2020 "
"They fled on trains and in cars like most people travel and I have seen and heard them in interviews at that railway station. They fled to other places in Europe. Lombardy is now locked down until April. They seemed the think it was a very good reason to get their stuff and depart. Yes, was in the middle of the night and the trains and cars were still running.Edited: 6:40 am, March 08, 2020 "
"This information is freely available on the Internet, for example a simple search shows this : It is still unclear if flights to and from Lombardy will be banned but the Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo has more detail now on the Italian government decree that has locked down more than a quarter of its population in a bid to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.It will allow people to enter and exit the red zones for serious reasons, bans all public events and closes cinemas, theatres and gyms. Religious ceremonies such as funerals and weddings will be banned. Discos and pubs remain closed throughout the country. Anyone who violates the restriction on entering select provinces of northern Italy faces three months in jail.In all the areas covered by the decree, including towns in the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont, schools will be closed at least until 3 April, as will museums, gyms and swimming pools. Leave is cancelled for all healthcare workers.The decree includes using the armed forces for border control and access points such as train stations and motorway entrances and exits in the region.So far the decree has been signed by the prime minister, but it will not be an official executive order until the council of ministers approves it. Further details on train and air service will be released in the coming hours.Conte signed the decree In the early hours of Sunday, enacting forced quarantine for the region of Lombardy – home to more than 10 million people and the financial capital, Milan – and 14 other provinces, totalling around 16 million residents.Thousands of people left Lombardy on Saturday night, before the decree was made official, crowding the motorways and train stations in the region, which will be locked down until 3 April."

"""Anyone in NYC, visitors or locals, that can describe the overall “vibe” of the city right now?"" City is the same that it always is. Maybe slightly less people in restaurants so its a little easier to get reservations. Lots of signs posted about washing your hands. Difficult to find hand sanitizer in stores. Most of the NY cases are not even in NYC. If you are elderly or have underlying conditions then the expert recommendations are not to travel. If you don't fall into either of those categories then its up to you. As always things can rapidly change so its best to monitor the situation."

The reason I answer it’s because someone on the NYC form keeps asking me questions. Which mostly are things that they could’ve looked up themselves anyway. Whatever is happening overseas will affect NYC - it’s just a matter of when.
For international travellers they should get a written statement from their travel insurance company confirming that their travel insurance will cover them for an epidemic/ pandemic so they can be sure they are covered for their trip to NYC or anywhere else. Many TI companies are wriggling out of covering people even if purchased before the cut off date in January.

"Thankyou for sensible information. My trip isn't until 24th April with my daughter for her 40th birthday. We are in the UK, both healthy and at the mkment not worried about the virus but have a lot of expense which will be wasted if the attractions start to be closed to the public. I know no one has a crystal ball to see the future but I'm asking New York residents what is your gut feeling. At the moment if I cancel I only lose £300,if I pay the full amount and Worl Health says its OK to travel, we will have to come or lose the money. Any sensible comments and updates would be welcome x"
#226 - What is the last date you can cancel with a minimal loss of funds? I'd monitor the situation and make a decision closer to that time.The NYS government seems to be doing a credible job but no one knows for sure.
"I don’t see how anyone is going to give you a gut feeling about this subject for next week, let alone seven weeks from now. Sit tight and let the facts make your decision."
"#226 - My gut feeling is that things will be either really, really bad (in which case, it sounds as though you will be able to cancel with no penalty? e.g., if the city is locked down the way northern Italy is) or - more likely - we'll continue to muddle along. In that second case, without knowing your travel style or what exactly you have planned, you can still have a fabulous time even if one or two things you were hoping to do are closed. So far, as you know, closings are very limited . . . it's hard for me to imagine places like the Met or MOMA closing unless we're in total lockdown mode. And then there are all the beautiful outdoor things to do in early spring, which will certainly be open unless we're all confined to our apartments then. (You asked for ""gut feelings,"" so there you go!)"
Fordham and Princeton are both cancelling in person classes and going to online lectures.
In terms of whether you should cancel or not I'd delay a decision as long as you can and still be able to get back most of your money. Nobody knows how this will play out but I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.im pretty sure we will see more closures and cancellations in the near future especially if there is a rapid increase of cases in nyc.

But what our two contributors have in common is a sense of responsibility in doing what they personally can to control the spread of the virus. I come out the same way. But for me, I add my respect for and faith in medical authority and scientific fact—and I will practice that faith, along with my own safety, by holding off for the time being. Ultimately, that is what will guide and hold our country and our world together (during a period of uncertainty and risk management). Business or family imperative would make the decision more difficult, but it would take a lot to convince me. I had planned to go back to Disney World (which I loved as a child) in October for a 5-day gee-whiz adult recap, already planned out meticulously. However, with the airport and park crowds and congestion, and the confined-space plane, I am going to hold off for at least a year.

"I think what Panch,shipwrecked and Littlebiffone say all make a lot of sense. Given what is going on and how this is developing day by day my feeling is that people should avoid non-essential travel. I don't feel at extreme risk living in NYC or anything, but there is a big difference between tourists and visitors. Locals live here and many of us aren't not going out every night. We go to work or school and then go home. Maybe out to eat once in awhile or to the gym etc. However, this pales in comparison to visitors who are often trying to see as much as possible in a short time. Many visitors are going all over the city all day long and sometimes well into the night. In addition, visitors are much likely to be in locations with large crowds namely tourist attractions. Finally visitors when they are done get on a plane, train, car, bus etc and head home or to their next destination. If a tourist picks up the virus not only are they running all over the city with it but they are taking it with them to bring it back to their community or next destination. With soo many people living here if this virus gets worse its not helpful to the city to have a lot of extra people on the mass transit system causing overcrowding."
"I have a slightly different perspective. I scrupulously follow public health guidelines, but in NYC at the moment, no one is calling for restrictions on movement or on limiting visitors to the city - so I don’t think anyone should be guilted into canceling a planned visit, or made to feel as though they’re less than responsible if they proceed with their travel plans. It’s still a balancing act, IMO, with no one right answer."
Agree. I'm traveling March 18thFollowing guidelines 20 times per day no joke and being extra careful Obviously will look updates day-by-day but I can't live in fear
"""no one is calling for restrictions on movement or on limiting visitors to the city"" for people over 60 CDC saying to stay home as much as possible and avoid large gatherings. The problem with NYC is we don't know what the numbers are going to be yet, because they are not testing at the needed level. Nobody is suggesting to live in fear, but maybe now isn't the time for non-essential travel when dealing with a situation that can change rapidly, which we have seen in multiple countries at this point. @Carlos by March 18th I think you are going to have a much better (maybe not full but better) picture of which way this is going."
"IMO a factor is that people seem to be either Chicken Littles running around stocking up on hand sanitizer and toilet paper or the Mayor from the movie Jaws who won't close the beaches This is not a Black Swan event - people have been worrying about these kinds of scenarios for a long time - and there could/should have been more proactive planning and rational communicationThe truth is somewhere in between - something to give serious consideration to but evaluate your personal health risk factors, financial risk and the possibility some activities may be impacted.Edited: 6:55 pm, March 09, 2020 "

It’s a perfectly acceptable choice. And for those who choose to travel to NY: thank you. The tourism industry is important and people rely on tourist dollars for their livelihood. There is no global right or wrong answer. There is only the right answer for the individual at this moment in time, given this particular fact pattern. Hope it all ends soon."

You couldn't pay me to go on a cruise ship after what we have seen happen to some cruises.
The repeated Norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships were bad enough (had a friend hospitalized because of one) https:/…Anyone who gets on one of those floating petri dishes right now must want a Darwin Award
"Three recent developments bear on cruise ships and travel risk generally. 1. On Sunday, Dr. Fauci offered this guidance: for people--particularly those age 70 and above with “underlying health conditions”: A. They should “think twice” about air travel, long trips and presence in any large crowd. B. He firmly urged people age 70 and above with underlying health condition to stay off cruise ships. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-pr…2. More broadly, for cruise ships the recent State Department guidance applies to [all] ""US citizens"": ""Passengers on Cruise Ships. US citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship."" https:/…cruise-ship-passengers.html3. Still more broadly, the age of increased vulnerability has been identified as 60 (not 70). In a press briefing yesterday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the Director of the CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, noted:""Starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease.” BOTTOM LINE: Taken together, the Advisories suggest: 1. All persons over 60 should consider themselves at increased risk for contracting the disease and possible serious negative outcomes, and should avoid, diminish or eliminate the known risk factors to the maximum extent feasible.2. ALL persons should avoid cruise ships in the current situation. A possible interpretation of the Advisories to one area of interest is theme parks (among others): In addition to anyone else wishing to reduce risk, grandparents (and other ""elderly"" over the age of 60) should currently consider avoiding theme parks--themselves, or with children or grandchildren-- due to the congestion and large crowds."
"If I'm considered ""elderly"" now I want a senior discount everywhere and Medicare"
"Scratch that! I just looked again and rebooked with another savings! We have 3 nights at Hilton Garden Inn in FiDi, with a water view room (SI Ferry) for a total of $520! Well, we are way under 60 and are very healthy, so we're not stressing that much over it. If it gets bad enough, the cruise will be canceled. The bad part is NCL is not giving us refunds!! They're making us book another cruise! The worst part is if we wanted to go somewhere else that week, we have to pay for a whole other vacation! Urh!!"

"The CNN article mentions passengers over 60 with UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. The CDC says ""older adults"" and people with serious chronic medical conditions ""are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness.""Anyone over 60 and those with underlying health problems should try to avoid places with large crowds -- such as movie theaters, busy malls and even religious services, infectious disease experts say.""This ought to be top of mind for people over 60, and those with underlying health problems,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime CDC adviser.""The single most important thing you can do to avoid the virus is reduce your face to face contact with people.""But why is age 60 often used as a threshold for those who need to be extra cautious?""We now know more about who is at risk,"" US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said.""(The) average age of death for people from coronavirus is 80. Average age of people who need medical attention is age 60."

"I'm not math and statistics savant, but: ""Average age of people who need medical attention is age 60."" There are more people who are under 60 than over 60, and in a much wider age range, which would mean that significant numbers of people under 60 need health attention. So going simply by the average number, to assume special attention needs to be paid as a risk factor, would be pretty silly. Like I said, my greatest weakness is in math-statistics (and science - product of the era where girls were assumed not to need STEM, and bought into it completely), so maybe I'm wrong...but no one is really off the hook here for prevention, attention, special care. Wash your g$&#@mn hands for as long as it takes to sing the first part of Born to Run."
"Re #258 The thing that shocked me about the most recent from CDC is that we oldsters are supposed to keep this up into 2021 -- the pandemic pantry, staying locked up in one's apt, etc. I had thought it would be a couple of weeks.

"I believe what was mentioned is that it may take a year, and perhaps more, to develop a vaccine. No one is expected to be locked up for a year. Medical research is not a vending machine where you put in $billions and a cure or vaccine pops out the bottom. Look how long it took to get effective treatments for HIV. The bug we have now is not fully understood and we will have to be patient."

We sure hope we can go ahead with these plans as they are to visit our children, and to attend my brothers wedding.I am under 60, himself is over 60, but consider ourselves fit and healthy Take no meds etc. So our health concerns me less.We are concerned with our elderly parents, especially as I see mine so rarely it would be hard not to visit them in Scotland when I am there. But I would hate to be the one to bring them such a dangerous virus. They both have lung issues. As Risa says, keeping washing your $%^&* hands, and why is this a new and exciting thing people? Hand washing should always be part of your day, many times."
"No what I read, I believe from Dr Nancy what's her face, the one who got shut up by the administration for not clearing her ""messaging"" in advance, was something like seniors need to maintain their anti virus behaviors into 2021 (staying inside, not going to crowded places). Of course, implicit in that is fact there is no vaccine, even if she didn't mention. But also implicit is assumption virus isn't going away soon. Personally, I'd rather go outside, get some exercise, and take my chances on dying. And frankly it's amazing to me they think all old people are happy to sit around in their rocking chairs counting tins of tuna and jars of peanut butter. I believe Dr Anthony Fauci, the voice of reason in this crisis, is 79. Is that what he's doing?"
#268 - i don't think Dr Messonnier was advocating people immediately go into a long term self isolation. Instead I think she was urging preparedness for possible disruptions. https://www.npr.org/2020/02/27/810016611/cor…I also think that since the virus is out in the community it will stay out there indefinitely (possibly with some seasonal fluctuation just like colds and the flu when people tend to be in closer proximity indoors)
"Dr Messonier said almost two weeks ago, and what got her shut up by WH and removed from photo opps, was to prepare for disruption.What I believe she was quoted as saying yesterday (first time I'd heard from her in about 10 days) was to prepare for very long period of disruption, that seniors need to be prepared for disruption in THEIR lives well into 2021 -- i.e. in addition to ""washing hands"" and ""social distancing,"" doing all the special ""healthy senior stuff"" -- stay inside, don't fly, don't go to the movies, performances, or anyplace else people gather (church, synagogue, etc.) have lots of food on the pandemic pantry."

Just a theory from observing what South Koreans have been doing to combat the spread of COVID-19...they’ve been seeing a decrease in recent cases because of social distancing and readily available testing. My point is social distancing measures are TEMPORARY (no one is saying this will go on forever) in order to slow down the spread. Certain cultures seem to act for the social/collective well being of society whereas we Americas (and the Italians) tend to dig in our heels and tend not to toe in line.
"""It doesn't make me wonder ... the odds are still relatively small even if you buck the advice and live your active outdoor life. Living in fear certainly is not an adder to a quality life"" The odds of elderly dying are much higher. We still don't know the extent that this has spread due to lack of testing."
"***Living in fear certainly is not an adder to a quality life"" The odds of elderly dying are much higher. We still don't know the extent that this has spread due to lack of testing.***Fully agree with the above. People need to remain positive, if one has a compromised immune system or they are elderly, different story."
"""My point is social distancing measures are TEMPORARY""I guess it depends on perspective - putting your life essentially on hold ""well into 2021"" isn't temporary IMO."
"The various guidances share this consensus:If you are over 60 with limiting conditions, we are offering you the best means we know to reduce risk and stay alive—not convenience—and to protect the rest of the community."
"#277 Exactly. My real fear is that by the time they say it's okay for me to go out and do the things I enjoy doing I'll no longer be able to do them. I think they need to come up with a form for old folks like me, a release like a DNR, saying you don't want any special efforts to be made, like ICU beds or ventilators, if you get COVID 19. That should ease the minds of millennials who think boomers are stealing all the resources AND the minds of boomers who are concerned they will live past the point they enjoy life and won't have a way out."

"Hi iStillDrinkwater, The message that we are getting now is that it’s best not to get on a plane going anywhere no matter who you are. People are cancelling their trips all over the world, and after so much work and organisation to get everything to fit into place including a number of hotels with best mate guarantees for it’s going to be very disappointing if. everything has to get cancelled.So many businesses will be affected by this, everything from travel agencies and restaurants hotels everything."
"#299 - I know it may be a bit tedious but reading back on this thread will give you a variety of info and viewpoints.Things are relatively normal - perhaps a bit quieter than usual.So far the only places that have had cancellations reported are places whose tours are a ""side business"" and have staff to protect so they can carry on with their primary mission. (UN tours, NBC Studio tours, Federal Reserve tours, backstage tours, etc.)There have been no reported closures/changes at Broadway shows, sports events, museums or tourist attractions.But things can change. I'd figure out your cancellation window for the trip , assess your personal health risk and monitor the situation to help you decide.Edited: 10:41 am, March 11, 2020 "

Just to note with the travel ban from Europe. Its not just if you are coming from Europe. If you are a foreign national you will not be allowed into the US if you have been in Europe within the prior 14 days.

If the ban is effective Friday midnight he might get in. The question is, will he get out?""The answer is we don't know. I don't think the airlines will suddenly cancel all their flights but they will certainly cancel a lot of flights to europe due to a very low demand for such flights. I'm also confused about the start time. Does Friday at midnight mean 12:00am on Friday? If so then that would be before your brother is due to fly in. Looking at another official statement that is linked a few posts above they talk about a 48 hour time frame which would suggest friday night."
If you have tickets to talk shows or late night shows you should double check because many are not having an audience going forward.https:/…
#343 - IMO the brother should call his airline ASAP - for the reasons Red mentioned. Depending on which carrier it is the options may vary.
"Also, ask in the air travel forum. There was a ban already for Italy so what the airline did in those cases may be indicative."
"Thanks for the answers. The announcement on the WH website saysSec. 5. Effective Date. This proclamation is effective at 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on March 13, 2020. This proclamation does not apply to persons aboard a flight scheduled to arrive in the United States that departed prior to 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on March 13, 2020.So according to that, his flight should not be affected. I guess its either a gamble whether his flight back will be canceled or not."
"Dan P,... one way of looking at it : The answer will depend on whether the airline is happy to send it's planes back to the EU where it may get stranded unless it can then go on to somewhere else where there is no travel ban. So, I think the answer may be obviously 'no' unless there is another way. Would visitors from the EU risk that?(I can't respond in the other thread for some reason)."

The mayor has indicated he will implement more and more restrictions in NYC today and tomorrow. Details have not been announced yet.

I am scheduled to arrive to LGA tomorrow for meetings in Manhattan and Brooklyn for 3 days. My only real concern is the city and airport being shut down completely and being stuck in NYC. That sure seems unlikely but I see in this forum that the mayor is to announce “new restrictions”? Does anyone think these will be domestic in nature - in essence locking down the city?

The containment area in new Rochelle is not a quarantine. The people who live inside it are free to come and go as they please.
The Met Museum will be closed starting Friday at all its locations. Carnegie Hall has also closed.
We may be reaching a point where people might want to reconsider trips to NYC if major attractions continue to close. Theaters and sporting events seem likely candidates for closing.

Why is Kate in Astoria so hostile.to.so.many posters?this is not helpful at all during this difficult.time
I predict that soon the subways will have a major.shutdown because crowded cars are a.great way to spread the virus
"""No one expected such a widespread problem in this day and age in an advanced country."" - It was pretty well known in the scientific community that this was eventually going to happen. Unfortunately the government failed to be properly prepared because they just assumed it wasn't going to happen anytime soon."
"""I predict that soon the subways will have a major.shutdown because crowded cars are a.great way to spread the virus"" - I doubt it will be soon. Shutting down the subway would decimate the NYC economy and by extension would probably help to tank the US economy. I highly doubt such an extreme measure will be taken until we can actually get some testing done. Destroying the economy without having sufficient data would be absurd. Is it possible? Sure , but I highly doubt it will be soon and I think it would be one of the most extreme actions taken. How are nurses/doctors/police/fire fighters/EMS etc all going to get to work if they shutdown mass transit? How are people going to get to their medical appointments? The more likely move would be a closure of schools and the government pushing for people to limit their subway use to essential travel. Employers will be pressured to let employees work from home., tourist attractions will be closed down, as seen already large venues will be closed."

"Anyone having a need to state they want people to stop traveling for pleasure is always going to be taken with a grain of salt; it is just one person's opinion and will not impact anything but such repeated comments are likely to eventually start to irritate people living here - No one has a clue what will happen tomorrow or even later today as things are rapidly changing - So, why not be satisfied sharing factual information instead of lectures as to how others (strangers) should plan their travel time. As an aside, Italy has a very strong social safety net even as they are economically fragile. They are suspending the need for people to make mortgage payments this month, for example, they all have access to medical care (they don't have to have waivers for co-pays, etc because they don't have any of those insurance features) - Their health care system right now is heavily burdened especially in the north.They are suspending certain taxes for businesses and restaurants, staff in restaurants are on salary as opposed to here - etc I mention all this because it is a universe of difference between Italy and the U.S. so to think with certainty that the U.S. will (or, can) pursue identical measures as Italy has done is very premature. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. We need to wait and seeFacts help - dire predictions and insistent opinions are pretty much nothing more than just noise right now."
"""Well, the mayor’s press conference just sealed the deal for us. No NYC for us next month."" probably for the best. While there is a lot of hysteria on the forums right now the reality is this is not an ideal time to visit NYC. Events and attractions continue to close.

Not sure if it was this thread but somebody was asking about the Seinfeld performance at the Beacon. That has been cancelled.
"So just to clarify all venues with over 500 people are banned in NY. Venues with 500 seats are less have to cut capacity in half. This includes bars and restaurants.

"""What about movie theaters? Will they live with the restrictions?"" - I believe movie theaters count as venues. I don't know how many seats most theaters have in NYC. IF more than 500 then they will be closed. I know in some countries they kept movie theaters open but every other row had to be empty.

"""Good point, it seems a lot of things are changing quite rapidly."" I'm still wondering what will happen with schools. They desperately don't want to close the public school system for a variety of reasons which are all legitimate reasons but then you have to ask yourself how effective these steps will be to stop the spreading if they have 1.1 million gathering in schools every weekday. Not to mention all the school staff."
"""Many art houses in Manhattan, to extent they still exist,are well under 500."" The question then becomes if it is financially feasible for them to stay open if their capacity is cut in half."

"Justin Trudeau's wife tested positive for coronavirus. Just shows how easy it is to get this, because I'm sure she was trying to avoid exposure."
"Lots of Americans in the EU trying to get home immediately before all flights to the US are cancelled. For those wondering, if you can't go in one direction, you certainly can't go in the other direction because there will be no planes to fly back on, except maybe the very last plane which has just dropped off the last people coming into the US and returning that plane back. Sorry, it's a bit convoluted, but those here hoping that somehow people will be able to get back to the EU, will only be able to do so via a very circuitous route."
"<< Justin Trudeau's wife tested positive for coronavirus. >>Yes she did; the test result was made public Thursday evening. She had been tested Thursday morning, after developing flu-like symptoms Wednesday night, as she had recently returned from a speaking engagement in London, England.She is apparently doing well so far, and her symptoms have been relatively mild. I wish her, and everyone else who becomes ill during these difficult times, a speedy recovery."
Something that never would have occurred to me...On tonight's NPR radio show The World they mentioned that some airlines might keep flying (even mostly empty planes) because at high demand airports they can lose their landing/takeoff time slots if they do not use them. Apparently the time slots are so valuable/expensive that the loss of them might be greater than the losses from flying the planes.
"""some airlines might keep flying (even mostly empty planes) because at high demand airports they can lose their landing/takeoff time slots if they do not use them."" this was true however the FAA waived the rule that was causing this until May 31st as of yesterday,"
"""Lots of Americans in the EU trying to get home immediately before all flights to the US are cancelled. For those wondering, if you can't go in one direction, you certainly can't go in the other direction because there will be no planes to fly back on,"" - This isn't accurate. There are planes that will continue to fly back and forth between the US and the EU. Its not like all of a sudden there will be no flights. What will happen is that the frequency of flights to the EU will be reduced based upon the diminished demand at least to major EU cities. That's not the same thing as all flights suddenly stopping. In addition, flights into the US will be routed via specific airports for screening of passengers."
Just checked at local CVS about hand sanitizer. They won't put it out for sale until 7am. The employee there said people start lining up with a line that goes out the door and down the block at 5am. They even bring lawn chairs!
I heard a lot of Americans with in my own ears at EU airports saying they were rushing onto the next flight out to make sure they did not get stuck there and paying handsomely to get home. Best to tell them not me.Hence a circuitous route to get home via what ever airport. I love how people on here keep telling me things are not true. :)
""" I love how people on here keep telling me things are not true. :)"" Its important that we don't have inaccurate information here. All flights from the EU are not getting cancelled. Simply checking flight schedules confirms that. The prices may go up though as they cut back on flights, since there are less flights so trying to get cheaper flights before the ban kicks in makes sense."
"Red: First: thank you for your leadership in organizing and facilitating this very important thread, which continues to build.—-In your response to Sweetie (post 425), you mentioned:“Flights into the US will be routed via specific airports for screening of passengers.”Under the March 11 order, those flights will serve US citizens, permanent residents, their families, those falling within an exception—and apparently residents of countries other than the “26” (and not otherwise barred from entry).In this setting, there is a situation which may face many travelers—but which seems unclear right now:To illustrate: let us suppose a citizen of South Africa (not a “26” country) flies from Johannesburg to the US, with one stop in Paris (a “26” country). The question: have they spent part of a 14-day period “in” a “26“ country—and therefore be Ineligible to enter the US, under one or both of the following:A) Their plane stops in Paris to refuel, add/disembark passengers, and continues as the same flight number to JFK (1-stop); orB) Their flight terminates in Paris, and the airport becomes a transit area for them to take the next flight to JFK—either not leaving the secure area where the first plane lands, or going to another gate as required to board the second leg elsewhere in the airport (change of planes).If you or other contributors notice a governmental statement or a development that might help, it would be very much appreciated by those facing the situation."
"@429 I haven't seen anything in relation to europe about this, but I would check airline websites. What I can say is that Cathay Pacific on their website specifically noted that even transiting via china would result in the US banning entry to foreign nationals. I would imagine it is the same situation for Europe. The airlines will know the answer to this because the last thing they want is to be responsible for taking rejected passengers back to their origin."
"All very good questions Little Biff One, thank you. Hopefully somebody is frantically paddling in the background working out how that EU ban edict actually gets put into practice."
"Planes are probably the worse possible places to be in an epidemic such as this as the air is recirculated in the cabin. The reason for this is to save fuel (and money). In the past, there have been cases of drug resistant TB caught on a plane. Some regulations are needed in this regard. Washing hands and cleaning surfaces are all well and good, but the primary source of infection is breathing according to the CDC."

#437 - So they are not offering you a refund at this time? IIRC you live close enough you may be able to reschedule a visit with minimal grief - but that seems unlikely to be the case for many ticket holders who travel from farther away..
Planes are actually quite clean - you're more likely to pick up an infection in the airport or on the train there. Modern planes feed air through high grade filters and completely replace the air with frsh stuff from outside every 3-8 minutes or so. You're not just breathing the same stuff for multiple hours.

I went to the grocery store again. Even though they restocked last night many of the shelves were once again empty. I was reading some interviews with store employees that were saying people are just panic buying but they are buying stuff that is not going to be any good in a few days.

"@474 I will check the whole foods, but grocery stores in NYC are likely not comparable to stores outside major cities for a variety of reasons. One of the biggest is they tend to be smaller so there are not as many goods available. Also, people in NY often do not buy large amounts of groceries in one trip because many live in apartments with limited storage space. However, what is happening suddenly is many many people going shopping and buying in much larger amounts than they typically do. The stores can't keep up."
"Besides being smaller city stores will have much less backroom space to store stock for replenishment.The New Yorker has dropped the paywall on all their Coronavirus coverage including an essay on ""panic"" buying that introduced me to a great new German word - Hamsterkäufe, meaning to shop like a nervous, bulging-cheeked hamster https:/…we-are-all-irrational-panic-shoppers"

Also, not a single person was wearing a mask, which is a good thing: masks do not help, as we all know by now. New York is a very different story of course... be careful and stay healthy, folks."

Didn't the toilet paper madness start in Australia?I think the water buying frenzy is another example of - Hamsterkäufe (Just loving that word - face timing with German friends tomorrow and hope to learn how to pronounce it properly) and perhaps because it's something you put inside your body and IIRC a recommended supply for some types of disasters.NYC is unlikely to lose water - there's enough natural water pressure in the gravity driven system to get water up to about a six story building (think the height of tenement buildings) and high rises that use tanks would only lose water if the power to the pumps went out. The city water needs minimal dislnfecting.

"Re: Posts 508 and 509Red and Warrior: thank you—these are very important developments.The issue is coming to a head around Crowds-Promimity.With the united medical authority, the experience in China (separation) and Italy (not separation), the closing of entire school systems in more than one dozen states, emergency powers invoked by Governors to limit crowd size to 250-500, the closing of theme parks and the suspension of Broadway shows, hundreds of corporations directing staff to work off-premises, and cancellation of many major athletic events and conferences worldwide:The weight of authority and practice is that a pandemic is here and an existential threat, and crowds and proximity are a chief means of propagating it—such that all assumptions about social organization must be reviewed and even draconian action taken to limit crowds and proximity.Against this there are the educational, supervision and nutritional needs of children served by schools—and not served and creating new supervisory burdens on working parents and nutrition challenges by closing schools, especially in huge and sprawling districts (with strong teachers unions) like New York City.The issue has global impact, since infected persons can transmit to foreign visitors to NYC (averaging 1.2 million weekly previously). The only certainty is the $50 billion emergency funds are an inadequate measure of the actual costs nationwide.The test this week will be whether there is enough of a showing that mechanisms CAN be set in motion (not all presently in place) to deal with the consequences of closing the schools—now 2 weeks, but potentially for an indeterminate period of time.Edited: 4:41 pm, March 14, 2020 "

Schools can be kept open for childcare needs and to have meals available for takeout. They could also be used for testing centers when we get more tests in. Just reducing the number of students in the building will allow them to use social distancing. Part of deblasio's logic is that teenagers will just roam the city if they are not in school.

"If you read the CDC site, the virus is spread primarily by breathing and not touching surfaces. While there is nothing wrong with hand washing, I suspect this is being promoted as busy work as there is nothing we can do about breathing.https:/…I am pleased to report that there is a full supply of toilet paper in Flushing, the birthplace of ""don't squeeze the Charmin."""
"""Where in the US and how? If it is being done, it seems like extra law enforcement is needed and they could also refuse via their union.""I said some of the actions I described are being taken around the US and the world. In other parts of the world children are not being allowed out. Multiple states have shutdown their school systems. In terms of how it would be enforced we are talking about minors not adults here. For example Buffalo has a curfew where Sun-Thursday minors are not allowed out on their own between 9pm and 5am. Minors in all of new york state are not allowed to drive unsupervised between 9pm and 5am. Basically restrictions on minors are much more likely to be upheld by the courts than the same restrictions on adults. In a situation like this its a real question whether or not the courts would allow an entire lockdown of NYC but they likely would be quite ok with minors not being allowed to wander the city unsupervised."

#521 - you didn't answer how NYC would enforce this minor restriction you speak of - not trying to give you a hard time but I really think it would be hard to enforce. I guess we'll see what develops.
"Re: post 515Red has identified a key point—crowd reduction, as in closing the schools but using them with fewer students.The problem may be: what is acceptable priority adequate crowd reduction—that protects public safety—while allowing some functions....and how to measure that?Watch this point: Disney closed many parks. If they reopen them in the near future, what is acceptable crowd size—not just to them, but to medical authority if there is a difference of opinion?"
"@523 There are curfews for minors at night I believe in San diego, Dallas, New Orleans, etc. There has been discussion about doing so in the past by city council as well. These are all night curfews designed to reduce juvenile crime, but the same premise applies. Realistically kids are not going to wander the streets on their own and would do so in groups, so it would not be difficult to spot them, especially given the reduction of people on the street that we are already seeing and closures of businesses. For example the other day I went by the empire state building and the area around it was the most empty I have ever seen it on a weekday. There were people walking around but a much diminished number for an area that can often be crowded."
"""The problem may be: what is acceptable priority adequate crowd reduction—that protects public safety—while allowing some functions....and how to measure that?"" - yes they just don't know the answer to that. Some states say 250 people is too much. Some say 500, some places don't like more than 50 people etc etc. Its not known yet."
"New York had its first death from coronavirus. It was an 82 year woman who had underlying medical conditions, so somebody in the very high risk category."
"Let’s hope the Mayor takes the point about class reduction seriously.It might be helpful to address the students all at once on television—to tell them what has happened (skipping the weeds), explain its significance, and enlist their cooperation during this period.But it will only work if you talk to them as adults, not children. The alternative to resolution is a city, stressed to the max, edging toward confrontation..."

"""The Mayor should now enlist proponents of the closings in how to serve public health, the students, parents and the city if their recommendation is accepted."" Schools are closed in the summer. They deal with the same exact issues. Los Angeles and Chicago both have higher rates of poverty in their school systems and they are closed. If the mayor can't figure out how to do this when other large school systems with higher poverty rates can then we need a new mayor immediately."

"If the Mayor does nothing else, I would certainly appreciate his office advising how long people are supposed to be shopping for:2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years, 2 decades? Also need advice on what they expect in terms of supply chains, that is, is there never ever going to be any more pasta , pasta sauce, frozen veggies, toilet paper, etc? If people had some advice on this they might be less inclined to buy everything in sight.I was talking to Trader Joe guy outside 3d/31st store today as I decided whether to get in line (didn't). He said they didn't bother ordering specific things any more; just took whatever they got because whatever it was people bought it all right away.Also said sometimes they couldn't restock shelves simply because had no employees free to unload trucks when they arrived as TJ employees were so busy trying to control the mayhem downstairs in the store. Another TJ employee told me same thing 2 days ago."
Re: Post 531Red has the most immediate point: this may be a referendum on the Mayor.
"My neighbor's daughter near Commack, LI, mentioned that all the meat was sold out in one large grocery, but she could find more at a meat store.

"#520 Just to clarify, COVID-19 is NOT spread through breathing UNLESS someone nearby coughs and you inhale their respiratory droplets, hence the need to cough into your elbow or into a tissue that gets discarded immediately. The CDC website actually explains that when droplets land on surfaces people can also become infected by touching those surfaces. Hand washing with soap and water is one of the most effective ways of preventing spread at the moment.#530 << The CDC has now issued a guidance that 8 weeks of school closure may be much more efficacious than 2-4 weeks—which 2-4 weeks may have very limited effect on containing the virus. >> The US is beyond containment now, it should be all about “flattening the curve”."

"Anecdotal data from a visit to the UWS today.I had to attend a memorial service. (Yes, we tried to do some distancing but with limited success due to the nature o the event)Took a cab in - relatively normal amount of Saturday traffic on the Triboro, FDR.and surface streets.Not to avoid transit - but because I was running late. As usual gave the Green cab driver a generous tip (~30+%) as I needed to be dropped a little outside the zone where he can legally pick up another fare.Most shops and restaurants appeared to be open.Mix of attendees (most local, a few had flown in from various places. A couple of older people wisely chose not to fly in)Talk among locals (from 20's to 60's) was office closures and working from home will happen - most have employment where this is theoretically possible Some had employers who seem to have a practical plan because telecommuting was already a known technique with each employee already having an appropriately configured laptop - for others the plan was TBD but consensus was most of their workplaces will close.Out of towners from the west coast had similar sentiments. Visitors from smaller ""flyover"" places concerned but no firm decisions on workplace adaptation that I heardThe other related topic discussed was the grocery runs on places like Whole Foods and Trader Joes and some surreal experiences by an reverse commuter (NYC resident who works in NJ) at a Walmart and a Costco.On the way back home stopped in a Gristedes grocery on Bway ~9 pm to buy a couple things I'd forgotten. It *did not* look like it had been attacked by locusts. - there was noticeable low stock of bottled water, toilet paper and a pretty picked over meat section but not completely empty. Plenty of fresh veg. (So if you need supplies try the more old school grocery chains before you give up)Took the bus home to Queens (Bway bus to M60 bus) Seemed to b e fewer people out walking (~9 pm ish) and a few places closed - but not sure if it was past normal closing times or an adjustment for current events.. Normal amount of people on the bus for the time of day"

"Unfortunately, it is the resistance of the Public School System to prepare for live streaming of classes that is creating confusion for parents. My daughter has removed her children from school and has started to home school them, based on a plan of her own making. They are desperately awaiting for a proper system and curriculum devised by the teachers to address the problem. Understandably there are kids without computers (maybe it's time for Corporate NYC to come to the rescue on this, and others who have no Day Care, those can be kept in ""school"". Having the majority of kids ""at home"" eases school density.Meanwhile the kids who are in Private Schools have been sent home with all their books and are told to be ready for streaming classes.There is of course the issue of children being ""secret carriers"". My daughter says when she walks down the street with her 3 kids, older people tend to move away and cross the street. Kids are one reason we have been prevented to come and visit. They don't want the 70 year old grandparents catching the virus, Thank God for FACETIME."

"With tools like Google Classroom, having lessons online for students isn't that difficult. You do not necessarily need to live-stream them.

Our schools just closed for two weeks and students wanting a lunch and breakfast will be able to get them in a drive-up capacity at two locations in town. There will also be free food giveaways through our ongoing backpack program. These are supported by the local food banks and supermarkets who would otherwise throw away ""surplus"" food.Now if I could just find some toilet paper..."
"On computers, it is my understanding, based on something I heard on TV recently, that kids from a certain grade up (maybe 5th) are given computers, so some of them should have them.I heard this week from a couple college classmates who teach at university level that the switch there to online was very swift (at least one of them suggesting it was a bit of a challenge for her to get technologically up to speed in an hour or so).Part of the problem with the city schools is I fear quite a few kids have no internet connection at home (in addition to no food). But I agree these are all issues the city should have addressed as part of its emergency planning."

While they probably *do* have some more space before any actual infections I think possible supply chain problems may be the first inconvenience and could become a serious issue at some point - especially for the local businesses that do not have the robust distribution networks/suppliers a place like WalMart does (since they seem to react well in emergencies like hurricanes etc.)They did do a pantry stock up at WalMart and otherwise planned to rely on their town grocery store. Didn't appear to fully appreciate the potential supply chain / delivery problems that could impact local availability. Urged them to inventory their pantry & freezer for possible further replenishment *and* stock up on prescription meds ASAP Both are 65+, have (relatively minor) preexisting conditions but do rely on multiple prescriptions."
"I can recall back in the 1950s, there would be periodic epidemics of measles where half the school students would be out at the same time. This was also airborne like the current virus and before we had vaccines. A bit early, there were school, swimming pool. and moviehouse closures for polio that often peaked in the summer. This disease was passed by the fecal-oral route from people not washing their hands well after the bathroom. Only a small percentage of those infected developed the paralyzing disease. The Salk and Sabine vaccines quickly eliminated this concern. Closing school did little in this case as children would play with each other when school was out."

Like coronavirus, there were serious and not so serious cases, some didn't know they had it, some thought they had colds, some had bad cases (paralysis, iron lung machines) and some died. The last big epidemic was around 1952, when 50,000 or 60,000 had it, around 3,000 died and I don't know how many were seriously ill/paralyzed. When I was in college I had a roommate who had had polio in the early 50s (and I believe was in an iron lung for a time). Her major lasting effect was something to do with her spine, something that affected how she was measured for clothes, like maybe one side of her was slightly longer than the other.One of the great principal dancers of New York City Ballet's early years --- Tanaquil LeClercq -- came down with it suddenly while the company was touring in Europe one summer. She was totally paralyzed. Though she later regained use of upper body,her lower body and legs remained paralyzed and she never danced again.

Restaurants I feel a bit different about though. The capacity limits might alleviate the concern with them or maybe not. Also, if that isn't enough they can just offer takeout/delivery service. Some restaurants will fare much better than others if that comes to pass. I just don't see a legitimate reason to keep bars open given the circumstances."
"Yes, ""closing restaurants"" will still allow takeout and delivery, at least at first. The ""legitimate reason"" to keep such places open is that a large number of New Yorkers work in the service industry (I've seen a number as high as 19% recently). But it looks like the experiment with voluntary social distancing failed miserably, so I'd have to agree with you - it's time for them to close :("
"""Yes, ""closing restaurants"" will still allow takeout and delivery, at least at first."" - I think they will keep takeout in place.

"#582 Yes, measles (both kinds), mumps, and chicken pox were the unholy trinity of childhood illnesses back in those days. People are very fortunate they can be avoided today. Chicken pox was the most traumatic for me. My mother discovered it just before I left for a birthday party. The hosts kindly sent over some of the refreshments including mint ice cream molded into the shape of a lamb. I had never seen anything like this before and imagined I missed the greatest party ever."
What a lovely memory Fox.When I had chicken pox my mother was in hospital giving birth to my youngest brother. My dad made us caramel from condensed milk and bought a pack of biscuits called Iced Vovos. I spent the night throwing up and have never eaten either again.
A lot of the courts are shutting down. Cases are being administratively adjourned for at least three months if the person is not incarcerated. At least one month for people who are incarcerated. I've seen NYC go through a lot but this is up there in terms of severe events. Not even 9/11 brought the city to a complete shutdown the way that is being contemplated now.
The first US appearance of West Nile Virus in 1999 in Flushing was a scary time. They quickly announced helicopter spraying and I recall the streets being totally vacant during this. Parks were avoided and going out at night was deemed risky. This disease has since spread entirely across the county.

About time. There was no reason for bars/clubs etc to stay open. I'm ok with restaurants going to delivery only. Now hopefully people will leave the subway for essential travel only. Unfortunately the trains continue to be full of homeless camping out and subway performers. Would be nice if the city addressed that.
It's sad but had to be done. Too many people ignored voluntary social distancing.

"The press release:AMID LACK OF FEDERAL DIRECTION, GOVERNOR CUOMO, GOVERNOR MURPHY AND GOVERNOR LAMONT ANNOUNCE REGIONAL APPROACH TO COMBATTING COVID-19 The three States will limit crowd capacity for recreational and social gatherings to 50 people - effective by 8 PM tonight Restaurants and bars will close for on premise service and move to take-out and delivery only effective 8 PM tonight Movie theaters, gyms and casinos will temporarily close effective 8 PM tonight Uniform approach to social distancing will slow spread of COVID-19 throughout the tri-state area  Amid a lack of federal direction and nationwide standards, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont today announced a regional approach to combatting the novel coronavirus - or COVID-19 - throughout the tri-state area. These uniform standards will limit crowd capacity for social and recreational gatherings to 50 people, effective 8 PM tonight. This follows updated guidance that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued yesterday recommending the cancellation or postponement of in-person events consisting of 50 people or more. The three governors also announced restaurants and bars will close for on premise service and move to take-out and delivery services only. These establishments will be provided a waiver for carry-out alcohol. These measures will take effect at 8 PM tonight. Finally, the three governors said they will temporarily close movie theaters, gyms and casinos, effective at 8 PM tonight.  This uniform approach to social distancing is meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.  ""Our primary goal right now is to slow the spread of this virus so that the wave of new infections doesn't crash our healthcare system, and everyone agrees social distancing is the best way to do that,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""This is not a war that can be won alone, which is why New York is partnering with our neighboring states to implement a uniform standard that not only keeps our people safe but also prevents 'state shopping' where residents of one state travel to another and vice versa. I have called on the federal government to implement nationwide protocols but in their absence we are taking this on ourselves."" Governor Murphy said, ""With all we are seeing in our state - and across our nation and around the world - the time for us to take our strongest, and most direct, actions to date to slow the spread of coronavirus is now. I've said many times over the past several days that, in our state, we are going to get through this as one New Jersey family. But if we're all in this together, we must work with our neighboring states to act together. The work against coronavirus isn't just up to some of us, it's up to all of us."" Governor Lamont said, ""The only way to effectively fight the spread of COVID-19 is by working together as states. We have shared interests, and a patchwork of closures and restrictions is not the best way forward. I know that because of this collaboration, we will save lives."" ###"
"Cuomo is also encouraging the closing of all businesses other than food, gas, drugs and healthcare. This is not mandatory yet."

Cuomo is asking for the army to be mobilized to help build temporary hospitals. I really don't understand why the governor has to repeatedly beg the federal government to take these steps.

"Re 633.Kaye: the stunning article you posted is devastating.It may be worse.There are approximately 45 hotels tentatively scheduled to be constructed in Manhattan between June of this year and the end of 2022:2020 (7 months): 142021: 242022 7There are also about 100 permits granted for future hotel development. It is clear that many of the 100 permitted sites will not be developed in the foreseeable future (or perhaps at all).However, many of the 45 properties now under development may experience severe pressure from five factors among others: (i) the conditions the Crain's article that you posted describes; (ii) competition from existing Manhattan hotels; (iii) the possible appeal of less expensive locations than NYC; (iv) economic stress on tourism worldwide resulting in decreased or deferred demand from the consequences of the virus; and (v) conditions of financing of one or more of the 45 hotels and possible reluctance of some investors to proceed.There are further issues with the approximately 415 licensed and inspected hotels now operating in Manhattan. To simplify: for cost and competitive reasons, it would not be surprising if over time some of these operating hotels are converted to other uses.Edited: 7:05 pm, March 16, 2020 "

#640 - Biff - It's a side effect of being a part time misanthrope
Converting hotels to apartments is more complex than many realize. A major problem is the window area/floor area ratio. I know of one project south of Central Park where the developer replaced all the windows with larger ones. Affordable housing can be at cost or subsidized. I live in an at cost co-op with monthly charges less than half of local rentals.

@633 Not really surprising. The government really needed to spend more time reassuring people that the food supply chains are fully secure. People hear things like lockdown and then they see empty shelves in all the stores and start to panic and think its the end of the world.

"Quote from Andrew Cuomo tonight during an interview: ""“I don’t see a curve; I see a wave,” he said. “And the wave is going to break on the health care system, and I am telling you, my little brother, it is going to be a tsunami.” He said the system doesn’t have the capacity to deal with any of the projected models on the number of people who will need care. ""Its an ominous warning but just underlines the seriousness of the situation we are facing in New York."
"Yes, here they've been talking about the American health care system and how it's unlikely to cope....frightening.But on good news, Venetians are not raiding their supermarkets ...they're even still delivering...,,,,,whilst here, groups of people from Melbourne are hiring minibuses and heading to country towns, some 2 hours away, and raiding their supermarkets. So distressing to hear."
"""But on good news, Venetians are not raiding their supermarkets ...they're even still delivering..."" - my understanding is the Italians did exactly the same thing with their grocery stores and then eventually realized that there is no shortage of food and stopped doing it. Hopefully the people here get the hint sooner than later because I'm tired of empty shelves because people feel they need to buy out everything. Hoarders are the worst."
"I normally keep extra food in my freezer during the winter in case there is a major storm when I do not want to go out. This time, I filled the freezer with chicken and veggies in case I am not able to leave the house. I also made certain I had enough medications for a couple of months. There is prudence that dictates reasonable measures. However, the run on toilet paper and the buying of large quantities of bottled water seems unnecessary.

Deblasio says he is considering a full lockdown of NYC like San Francisco where people can only go outside to go to grocery store or for a walk for weeks. Hopefully people only go out for essentials at this point because a more severe lockdown will be devastating.

"At the end of the day, the governor is not going to let the mayor screw up NYC too much, at least not now."
"""At the end of the day, the governor is not going to let the mayor screw up NYC too much, at least not now."" yes there is already reporting where the mayor is undercutting his own medical experts. I'm content to just let Cuomo handle it . I'm not sure why Deblasio is running his mouth now. They need to be on the same page. ""Not happening."" - I wouldn't say its not happening. Its not happening right now, but what I once thought could never happen may eventually happen. If people want to avoid such an outcome they need to stay home except when absolutely necessary. Obviously Cuomo doesn't want to do it, but if people can't control themselves they may force his hand. I do think there will be more restrictions as an intermediate step. On a positive note I found some toilet paper and soap. Still no hand sanitizer or thermometers though ."
"Yes, correct. Not happening now. If we behave ourselves and act responsibly, it won't be necessary.Since I am mostly staying home, and have enough sample hand sanitizers that were giveaways at events and such, I am not buying any. If you stay at home and wash your hands, you don't need it. And the few times I have ventured out, they were available where I was (Eataly has them at the registers if you ask). And they have them out at my lobby desk.I am also not worrying about buying a thermometer. If I have termperature, I will know it."
"""Yes, correct. Not happening now. If we behave ourselves and act responsibly, it won't be necessary."" That is a mighty big IF. There were people on the subway but nowhere near the normal even during rush hour and people were sitting a couple of seats apart at least even on the platforms people know to stand six feet away from each other."
"Yeah, that's not the problem. It's the churches and synagogues that still haven't closed, the people who are having celebrations and parties...if they don't stop it, then government will. And that will be awful for the rest of us.I haven't been on a subway since last Monday. I am lucky I have the luxury of being able to walk anywhere I may need to, for the short term. I can't even imagine having to get on one, for now. But that doesn't mean that I think they should be shut down. If I need to in the next few weeks, it will be BECAUSE there is an emergency requiring me to get on one. And that's why the city shouldn't be shut down. A shut down will create dangers for many too, and that's what the governor is trying to avoid."

"There is probably room in NYC's massive city hospitals. The hulking Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx housed 898 beds originally, but now uses only a modern addition with 348 beds. Places like Bronx State Mental Hospital probably have unused floors. Fitting up old hospital buildings for modern use would take some doing. Of course, staffing is another major matter."
"Some more anecdotal data from various places.One friend, a teacher in TX, was vacationing in FL. Due to school closings has extended time there as can do on-line lesson stuff from anywhere. Not as recreational as a usual vacation due to closings but there are worse places to be in exile.~85 year old friend who lives in a senior community upstate - No visitors allowed inside, No dining in the dining hall - meals delivered to each apartment, No large groups inside - can get together for card games but not movie night, etc.A friend in VA has a daughter who is a recently graduated RN.

"Seriously Andy Breitbart??????That's what you consider to be ""real news""?I do occasionally have issue with some NYT reporting but wow. Just wow."
"Say what you will Kaye, but The NY Times, and many others, are reporting inaccurate stories."
Yes Breitbart is well known for inaccurate/false reporting and is a right wing publication. In a time of crisis I don't think its appropriate to be referencing publications like that when what we need is factual reporting. Its becoming annoying with everything going on that we see a few individuals talking about fake news . Next thing you know they will go right back to claiming this is nothing worse than the flu.
"The NY Times is a left wing publication, moot point, no?Best thing, forget the “news” media, they want to sell stories.Listen to the press conferences directly, then you won’t hear the words twisted later."
Surely you can find more respectable right leaning sources to reinforce your positions.
"Kaye, believe it or not, that’s up to you. But answer this, is the Times left leaning? Have other left leaning publications been caught telling lies?Listen to the person talking, not those who are “reporting” or speculating on what that person has said."
"Got itI try to be open to being educated (not ""schooled"")I have specifically asked you several questions about some of your posts over the past few days and have gotten crickets.That speaks volumes.Have a nice night."
Sometimes I don’t reply for obvious reasons.
"Andy, I listened(as you suggested) to the Monday briefing and I heard this direct quote ""no country has control over this"". The day prior the same speaker said and I quote ""it's a very contagious virus. it's incredible, but we have tremendous control over it"".Over a 24 hour period he lost control, not the media or anyone else . Still gave himself a 10 for his handling of all of this. I must say typing this reply does bring a smile to my face. Well needed relief from the seriousness of the situation. So for that I say thank you."
"Kaye, I so agree with what you wrote in # 675. The only candidate I voted for that I believed in was Senator Bill Bradley. Like you, it is usually a lesser of 2 evils.I find it troubling that people defend those who do not vote on the basis it is the candidates responsibility to make the voters enthusiastic and eligible voters will stay home because they are not enthused. As if not voting for one who better represents your ideals helps the cause of those who chose to sit out election day."
I noticed at some grocery stores they are starting to have special hours for the elderly to do their shopping.
"I choose not to engage in this debate, but I have been listening to only actual press conferences, not reporting of what has been said (although I have been shocked by headlines I've caught about a press conference I'ver heard directly and been shocked at the spin). I've listened to almost every one of Governor Cuomo's press conferences: they are patient, factual, specific, responsive, and, notably, apolitical (despite some of the best efforts of the reporters to draw him into engaging on political matters - he has refused). He has been respectful of national office, but has called out where the weaknesses are in being able to protect New Yorkers. That's his job. What's been interesting is the trajectory, the evolution of policy as the situation has unfolded. He doesn't contradict himself, but rather, he expands based on new information. It's been fascinating to watch him say ""we don't know yet..."" come back the next day (or a few hours later) and say ""we now know that ...., and so we have to ...."" If you listen regularly, you hear what he needs, what he has been saying NY needs (specifically, it started with access to tests, approval for private tests, when he got that, he needed to set up more centers, which he did...and keeps expanding that. He said we needed more hospital beds, more equipment, he identified where we needed to get more beds and equipment...it's been a steady progression. Frankly, I've learned a lot.)The WH press briefings have not been so clear. Or consistent. OR transparent. It's been frustrating to watch a press conference where 3 speakers disagree on next steps, or Congressional testimony on whether tests will be covered. It's been a mish mash. Our governor, in my mind, is a benevolent bully, and that's what we've needed to get this done. Looks like the Army Corps of Engineers will be coming in to help build more hospitals (out of dorms and other existing spaces, just as he requested. That is a good thing. The best entertainment, however, are the Chris Cuomo interviews of Andrew Cuomo. Better than Kimmel, Colbert, and Fallon combined."
"Risa, you have always said nice things about Cuomo, long before this issue. While I agree that Cuomo has been doing a good job, you can’t compare a press conference from a governor vs. a president. Yes, there has been disagreement during the WH press conference, but things are rapidly changing and a live press conference can not be easy."
"You're correct. I have a soft spot for him, he's always been very nice to me. But I don't think I'm the only one who thinks he's been doing an outstanding job. Surprising even me. I know he can be something of a bully. But I watch the comment feed on Facebook during the press conferences and I see a lot of repeat names of people watching over and over. And I also see a lot of repeat comments like ""I don't really like him, but he's doing a great job on this."" That exact comment probably comes up more times than any other comment. Over and over. You can try watching with the sound off if you don't want to hear him, and you will see for yourself that what I'm saying can be verified. There's a reason I like him, and I read the same analysis a few days ago: he annoys everyone, he's a liberal with a sensitivity to business interests, he's a progressive who strongarms people to his positions. He is willing to make deals with corporate interests to benefit disenfranchised. The left doesn't like him because they think he lets corporate interests dictate policy. The right doesn't like him because he wants to spend money on programs for people who need government help. I like him because he has ALWAYS said (back in his first race for governor - I remember going to a few events back then and hearing the same speech about it over and over) that it doesn't need to be one against the other, rather, it should be a 3 way partnership between the public sector (government), the private sector (corporate interests), and the individuals. I think what pisses people off about him is that he really believes that, no one can really control him because he's always trying to find that balance, not giving anyone too much power. I like watching him struggle to find a way to get that done. It doesn't make him friends, but it does make him successful. Everyone walks away feeling like they didn't quite win that round, but it's better for New Yorkers that a consensus was reached."

"Regarding timeline, with so little known about what will happen with the virus, I don’t see any other way to operate than vague. Perspective from someone in the “Laid off” crowd — the vagueness helps. If we were taking it week by week, my job would probably be dangling me along by a thread. Week one, sick time paid out. Week two, unpaid leave, because no need to take more drastic measures hoping that the next week, we’d be back in action. Week 3? Ouch. The “we don’t know when it ends” led at least in my job’s case to quick action to get people laid off and connected with unemployment resources. Also re : #770 can we *please* stop blaming millennials ? I’ve seen plenty of people of all ages and governors of entire states acting stupidly, there’s absolutely no reason to blanket scapegoat young people. This is one of the biggest “we’re all in this together” situations most of us have (and hopefully will ever) encounter. Divisiveness and the blame game is unhelpful.

""here is an interesting read about the reality of thinking it's easy to just start making them:"" Nobody ever said it was easy to produce them ventilators. Actually all the more reason to get on it as soon as possible. However, the need is for a heck of a lot more than just ventilators. Gowns, masks, hospital beds, tests, etc. There is NO reason to take a wait and see position with this. There is no reason to say oh well such and such a company volunteered. That's great but I have no faith that is going to be enough. I have no faith in what we are hearing from the white house given the handling or lack fo handling of this entire crisis. What is the purpose of waiting? We need drastic action at this point. Not more excuses. Hospitals are running out of PPE"

"Regarding a ""war footing""...One thing I think people may not remember is that the US was ramping up production well before we entered WW2 as combatants. Because of the Neutrality Act and Lend Lease and FDR's push to build planes etc. The manufacturers didn't just decide to fill a perceived market need.I know this for certain as the bomber plant my dad helped build and operate (and where my parents met) was up and operational but the ""grand opening"" ceremony never happened because it was scheduled for December 7th 1941.The push to sew masks and gowns is certainly a good thing because it will allow the existing stocks to be used for the most important tasks. It is questionable if fabric masks can be suitable for use in surgery or protection from highly contagious patients. Probably useful for lighter duty tasks and the ""worried well"". (Does anyone know if hospitals usually have on-site laundries?)Don't know if the non-woven material approved for respirators and surgical masks (which have a known ability to prevent passage of particles a certain micron size https:/… is manufactured domestically and what the availability/capacity might be.We also have a limited (but hopefully sufficient) sewing factory capability.

#834 - Obviously - but didn't want to get reamed by anyone I might offend
"Post 809 - Absolutely re: ripple effects.(I apologize if the following post is depressing).1. Hospitals are not allowing visitors - I know a person that is on dialysis for kidney and liver. They are not only fearful - they have to be fearful alone with no physical family support. They are waiting on a new organ.2. Nursing homes are on lock down. Now, no visitors or limited persons entering/exiting facilities. Think of how the older people that occupy these facilities feel. The loneliness. Some may die, sadly, alone.My husband drove to Philly every other week to visit his aunt (at her facility) and take her out for lunch and a drive. She loved to talk politics. She was 90. He was saying he is happy that she passed away before this crisis. She would NOT have died in the peaceful manner. He would not have been allowed to be present or get the body and have the burial gathering. Unfortunately, others are not so lucky with the current restrictions. 4. With the death tolls rising at the current rate; morgues will become full. The question on what to do with bodies will come into play. Funeral homes are already asking families to scale back how they memorialize their loved ones by changing or postponing funeral services, limiting the number of people who can attend and increasingly using online tools.3. Sadly, the suicide rate will rise due to people becoming extremely depressed (some have already occurred). For people who lose their job at a mature age - ability of starting over may be the great question. Especially, in the over 50 crowd (as history has proven).Let us all try to call who we know and check on them. Offer support (in whatever form). It may be more helpful than we realize.

"#840 - I honestly don't know.As silly as it may sound, could you do something like wear a mitten on your left hand so you will be more self conscious about what you touch?"
"If a mitten would help discourage you from using your other hand sure. A mitten can't be used to touch surfaces though because the germs would just be on the mitten when you go to use it again unless its getting washed with each use.Edited: 4:41 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"They had to put a 12 year old in Georgia with the coronavirus on a ventilator. She had no pre-existing conditions. Its extremely rare for the virus to impact children, but that doesn't mean it can't happen or that the virus may not be mutating to the point where it can harm children. Bottom line is to simply protect children to the same extent that adults are supposed to be taking precautions. Better safe than sorry.https:/…index.html"
That was basically my reasoning - a (hopefully washable) mitten could make you aware of how often you unconsciously/automatically use the other hand so you can get an idea of how much you can trust yourself to only use the right hand.

Because most places in America aren’t affected the way a few key places are. When people start dying near them, they might understand that he’s been a lying sob in the face of the greatest health threat in over 100 years — all to con the market, and them, in an attempt salvage his craven presidency. As a NYer, I urge you and others to follow our governor, Cuomo, instead. He’s been a true leader with candor and passion and empathy and smarts. We are very lucky to have him in our corner.

The biggest problem with staying in NYC is too many people being out on the streets which leads to a lot of unnecessary contacts when you have to go to the store. I suspect when the death toll skyrockets the streets will empty out. Until then I will isolate as much as possible because I do not want to be in a situation where I have to go into the hospital system during the next few weeks."

"""The only reason I sent the UK link which is WHO and government advice based on science was a group of us watched your presidents press conference earlier and couldn’t believe he is able to present his misinformation apparently unchallenged."" - Yes because our president is full of it. However, if you watch some of the governors in the US who lead the individual states they are much much more realistic. The people on the stage with the president don't want to contradict him more than necessary because he is petty and will retaliate, so they don't always come out and say what they truly think and have to convey the information in a roundabout way."
"LandAl - oh yes many of us are informed & staying up to date. But your sharing WHO etc is very welcome! People must not be misled. They must follow the facts. So thank you!Dr Fauci is one of the experts I think you may be referring to. He is literally is an American medical hero. And right now he’s in a difficult position. Watching him behind the orange monster on the podium it’s clear he is very uncomfortable with what our moron potus says. And then, you might notice, after any statement, the press asks Fauci “what do you say about that Dr Fauci?” Because we know we can believe HIM, and we’re beyond grateful that his voice is so well respected by so many.

"#930: no, you are not.Re: your other suggestion - “Hand out timed tickets or let people signup online for shopping time slots or something” - I think that’s a good idea, though the need to check/inspect tickets etc. would create an additional exposure risk for store workers. One place where it could be implemented easily is the Park Slope Food Coop, where every member already has a card with a number that’s scanned when you enter (no touching required).

"if this lockdown lasts for 18 Months ( a possible scenario) How bad it will be for economy ? how many jobs will be lost ? how many family will suffer ? Sadly, this pandemic has effect on both health and economy, so the solution should be eying both sides , not just one side"
"The lockdown lasting 18 months is not a possible scenario. Will we be dealing with this for 18 months? sure Will some high risk people need to socially distance for that long? sure. What is certainly not going to happen is that NYC will not remain in a full lockdown like this for 18 months. A couple of months is likely, but beyond that it wouldn't make much sense."

"@944.Your right that no lockdown could last 18 months (well not without rioting) but perversely the longer the lockdown the longer the virus remains a problem assuming no vaccine is found.If there’s no vaccine you’d want to see a situation where most people had a natural immunity (and the immunity can wear off or the virus could mutate) such that transmission was weak, cases were few and far between and hospitals could cope. Naturally you’d get to that position much more quickly if you just allowed the virus to rip through the population, but you’d kill a lot of people unnecessarily in a few months. A longer lockdown and maybe the hospitals would be able to cope.Now, there’s an economic argument that says most Corvid19 victims will be economically inactive (retired generally), or unhealthy (Overweight, diabetic) thus costing the state or insurers a lot of money or in the case of the USA with no significant universal healthcare poor or unemployed. Whereas those with the best chances of survival are young and have access to healthcare. Overlay that with the fact that a depression will in itself cause a loss of life as well as financial losses and you get into a deeply unpleasant argument. Put a political slant over the top of that and things could get very nasty indeed."
"@955 I'm sorry the economic argument is that its better for the economy to kill off people with underlying conditions? Is that a serious suggestion? You know what happens if they just let this thing go? Hospitals get overwhelmed and many people unnecessarily die. Doctors and nurses die. See italy where even with the lockdown 15% of them are infected. Let it loose on the country and there won't be an economy. Only a nitwit would think that is a legitimate suggestion.

"""So the next time you feel tired and believe me I feel tired, but when I feel tired I think of the first responders who are out there every day showing up. I think of the police officers, of the fire fighters who are up there every day, the grocery store workers who are working double shifts just to keep food on the shelves because people are buying so much food because they're nervous; the pharmacists who have lines going out the door and they're showing up every day, day after day; the transportation workers who don't have the luxury of feeling tired because they have to get up and they have to drive the bus so the nurses in the health care professionals can get to work; and those health care professionals who are dealing with a virus that they didn't even understand - they still don't understand. They're there working, many of them seven days a week.So yes we're tired but look at what others among us have to do in the challenge they're under and how they are stepping up.

Fresh Direct is great but I hear delivery windows fill up fast.Amazon Fresh is decent - less selection than FD. Don’t know what’s happening w delivery windows there.
"I just used the pharmacy today to buy some quick food products mainly because it has self check out so you are not interacting with a cashier. The streets are less crowded than they were. As suspected once we had a 1,000 people die some of the slower people in the city finally got the message. Unfortunately there are still a few out there that are walking down the sidewalk three people wide taking up most of the sidewalk making it impossible to socially distance from them without walking into traffic. I watched a video stream from a delivery guy on a bike. Times square had like a dozen people in it. ROFL Have never seen times square that empty and I have been there at 4am on weekdays."
Glad this got reopened.But finding it a bit odd that it hasn't been bumped back up on the forum.Anybody have any feedback/opinions on Instacart (as opposed to Fresh Direct)? Kind of like the idea it could come from my local grocery store
yea I don't know why its not bumping back up either. I like the idea of maybe food can come from outside the city at this point so that way I am not pulling from the stock in the store which is already selling out quickly assuming the produce is fresh.
"I do see some distinction, but doesn't Fresh Direct have their distribution center in the Bronx?I was thinking more about giving my business to my local store (which is one of the small-ish local chains) and their sales numbers and perhaps the staff and delivery crew I interact with there.

"Kaye - I tried instacart and it was not good. A personal shopper goes to a store with your list. You get texts constantly while they’re shopping. Then they show up at your door. And most things are the wrong thing. Fresh Direct works so differently. They were going through some major growing pains last year, but they’ve worked out the kinks & if things go wrong, it’s simple to make it right. Ask for a credit, get a credit. They also have an inexpensive delivery pass. I think it’s Monday - Thursday $39 for 6 months. I don’t work for them lol. But I am a loyal customer. As for the local groceries, I’m not in nyc now but whenever I go to the Morton Williams or bodegas in our neighborhood they’re busy. As o understand it from friends still in nyc, the stores still aren’t ever empty of customers even now."

"Red the ventilator thing is an absolute travesty. There is no reason not to use that act to set production orders and pricing collectively on behalf of the entire country. Then, as Cuomo has said, send them to NY first. He’s personally guaranteed he will transport them to other hot spots later as the wave progresses and provide trained medical personnel as well. NY, and in particular, NYC, is in the cross hairs. Several other counties in NY aren’t equipped to handle what’s already started there & will soon pick up steam. I watch Cuomo daily but I have to stop watching any part of the briefings out of the WH because the magical thinking just makes me more anxious. And I can find any real facts that emanate from there elsewhere. As an aside, if people can afford to donate to various go fund me campaigns for furloughed workers, food banks, and tip people who provide delivery services generously, that would be a good thing.

"""The NYT had an article showing retailers boarding up their windows out of fear of civil unrest."" I don't think we are going to have civil unrest. I take that to mean ordinary citizens engaging in unrest, but maybe that is not the correct definition. I think more than likely a small criminal element will try to take advantage of the situation and I can only hope that the prosecutions of such individuals who would use a time like this to commit crimes will be stronger than they are for the same crimes under normal circumstances. That is what is typically done for crimes committed during blackouts etc. So far though we haven't seen that type of behavior, but a lot of the NYPD is going out sick so no telling what the future will hold.

"""Lodging owners were told that they could only house county residents or face penalties."" That doesn't sound constitutional at all."
I don't see how you would be able to prohibit homeowners (whether second home or not) from using their own homes. One would hope that they wouldn't hoard or engage in other bad behavior. But how could one be barred from their own homes elsewhere?
"I'm not going to lie, I'm worried for people I know in NYC. Over the years I've made friends at One Penn Plaza, especially in security and building management. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the management staff were hunkered down at home, but some of them probably have to show up. Same with engineering and definitely security. I've seen bad things happen to buildings even without human tomfoolery, and if those issues are allowed to fester, the damage is only made worse. So I'm pretty sure a lot of the big buildings around still have staff on site. I hope my friends are alright, especially security, who probably have the most face to face contact of anyone."
"@1001 If you are referring to the Rhode Island story I don't think they are being barred from their homes. They are being stopped and having their information recorded and having a mandatory 2 week self quarantine imposed where they do spot checks on these people. What is more questionable is if a person wasn't even going to rhode island but just passing through on a way to another state.

"I received an email today from a hotel on the Vineyard with which I have dealt in the past. They passed along the ""please stay away"" message, which in this case seemed to have been issued jointly by local officials and the local hospital. I have been in that hospital many times. Though I believe it has been enlarged, when I was last there it had 20 or 25 regular acute beds and 2 ""ICU"" beds. As I recall, the Nantucket hospital was even smaller as it had an even smaller population. Although I had relatives who received good care at the Vineyard hospital, I don't think it's a place I would particularly want to be at this particular time if I had a life threatening illness. Though both hospitals have relationships with off island specialists & hospitals and can move people by ambulance/ferry or helicopter, it all can get complicated and expensive.I think if I were going to leave the city I would want to go to someplace within an hour or so's drive of the city so I could get back if I didn't feel well."

"Hey I was born in Da Bronx...but Now crossing the Throggs Neck bridge is the borderI am in 406 or 408 (Not sure which since I cant see the lines like QUeens Blvd , Van Wyck or Grand Central)"
"I believe that is the United Hospital Association map that has been obtained under a freedom of information request. The numbers like 401, 406, etc. refer to neighborhood designations they use for recordkeeping. Read the key at the top to see what red, orange, etc represent."
"I think that map is a bit misleading since it doesn't tell us how many people are tested in each area. Just what percentage of the tests were positive. For example Staten Island looks closer to a higher risk, but in reality they only have 6% of the cases for the entire city where Manhattan which looks lower risk has 18% of the cases. Unfortunately any way you cut it Brooklyn is getting hit and Queens is getting hit a bit harder."
1023 - Gotcha - As a transplant will defer local privilege One thing that bothers me about the representations on that map is the (IMO very) odd percentage dividing lines in the color coding assignments.for the map areas.it's one of the hazards of graphic representations of data and in this case I think its a bit weird and not good communication - which is supposed to be the point
"I think alot of people in Manhattan hightailed out of Dodge as they had places to go elsewhere, Most people in Queens do not have second homes elsewherem Its more middle class"
"#1024 - Yes, I believe you are correct. Sorry I misread it #1025's point also makes the usefulness and clarity of information from the map more questionable."
"My interpretation of the key accompanying the version of the map I got is that those are the percentages of hospital inpatients who have tested positive for the virus, not the percentage of positive results for everyone who has been tested. Keep in mind the majority of people who are tested are not hospitalized.One ""expert"" comment I read regarding the situation around Elmhurst Hospital is there are many immigrant ""hospitality"" workers in that area, often sharing cramped accommodations with many other people. Something all these neighborhoods may have in common is groups of people -- whether related family members or unrelated roommates -- sharing places with not too many bathrooms."
"Also keep in mind this map apparently comes from the United Hospital Association, not the Mayor's office. I assume they are concerned with people being treated in hospitals, not the public at large."
#1030 - Wise caveats. The map was hosted on nyc.gov but still questionable usefuless.

(YOLO?)Will people change transport methods opting for travel by car that they might previously have done by plane, train or automobile?Will people choose to visit less densely built up destinations? (National parks or rural areas instead of cities?)Will short term rentals (where legal, hopefully) be impacted as they may have varying levels of attention to housekeeping or become more attractive to some who want to avoid what are perceived as more crowded hotels and resorts?Edited: 10:07 am, March 28, 2020 "
"I just think Subway ridership will suffer, right now I will not take a subway or a bus. How long will it be before its safe to take a subway or a bus"
"I think everything will be back to normal in a year or two as Americans generally seem to have short memories and since many won't get sick or live in relatively unaffected areas it likely will not have the impact that it will on NYC residents or residents of other hard hit areas . Look at the people who were flocking to the NPs even after the spread started in Washington state, California and NYS and forced closure of some of the more popular parks.Personally, I will drive within reason (always have) but will still fly for farther flung destinations. IMO flying is a hassle and maybe the virus will actually improve the experience (though I am likely deluding myself).Edited: 11:35 am, March 28, 2020 "
"Trump is actively talking about quarantining New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for two weeks. It sounds like Trump may be talking about preventing people from being allowed to leave the states. He hasn't even consulted with the governor yet and he is setting up an announcement. Doesn't sound constitutional. https:/…"
"red -You seemed to be on board with this a few days ago when you said the whole country should go on lockdown together. I pushed back about the enforceability of that and still have the same stance. I live 10 miles from the PA border and there are numerous local roads that can be taken to cross back and forth in just my area. People cross the border to shop and for medical services out of necessity depending on where you are talking because both northern PA and the southern tier of NY both have very rural swaths. People also cross the border for work at their essential jobs - Guthrie in the border town of Sayre PA is a major hospital and there are major hospitals in Binghamton NY (about an hour west). There are multiple prisons in Elmira NY which is again about 10 miles from PA which employ a good number of people. Paperwork can be obtained to allow people to cross but this would require stopping cars to check for it. And I am only referencing a few instances within an hour or so of my home. This would generally be the case in the roughly 75 stretch of the Catskills (which border PA) and along the rest of the NY/PA border between Elmira and roughly Jamestown NY (roughly 150 miles).So between the logistics of enforcement and reality I don't see how it is possible regardless of whether it is constitutional.Edited: 2:23 pm, March 28, 2020 "

"@1048 No I am not on board with specific states being singled out like this. I see the logic of suspending domestic air travel except for cargo and essential needs and I would support a nationwide lockdown similar to what we have in new york, until there is adequate testing to see where this virus is and isn't. I don't see the logic of targeting specific states especially when the people who were going to leave NY fled weeks ago and its all over the country by this point. This isn't a decision based on any data because they aren't doing adequate testing and the next two weeks is going to show that. Heck the mayor of Seattle was just on tv saying they still don't have the testing capability to do what they need to do after all this time. If everyone is on a lockdown then there is no real incentive to travel except for essential needs."
"@1049 Actually in that same story it points out that Cuomo denied any such conversation about a quarantine. Cuomo is quoted as saying: """"I spoke to the president about the ship coming up and the four sites, I didn't speak to him about any quarantine,"" Cuomo said. ""I haven't had those conversations, I don't even know what that means.""When you go outside of right wing media you would see the reporting that after Cuomo said that Trump said he would speak to Cuomo later about the possible quarantine. Meaning he didn't speak with him about it. https:/…index.html"
"First, We don't have borders between states. It's a ridiculous premise. rjr's experience is true all across the country.Second, Andrew Cuomo denied that he spoke with him about a quarantine. He said he spoke with him, but not about any quarantine. He said ""I don't even know what that means."" See my first point."
"A statement like that is a premature announcement, an attempt to create a distracting controversy or both.It is also likely to create a (hopefully unintended) side effect of spreading the virus farther as some people decide to bug out beforehand from here or other ""hot spots"" they think might be nextEdited: 4:26 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"A quarantine assumes everyone will rnon infectious in 14 days. Some might get infected on day 13. You would need a far longer period for this to be effective. The Delaware River forms a border between NJ and PA, but the northern edge of PA has no delineation from western NY. There have been years during drought when you could almost walk across the Delaware at Trenton by the waterworks."

Agree.....they are already talking about the second wave. Grrrr
"We are not in a ""lockdown"" or a ""quarantine."" We are in a shutdown of all non-essential services and businesses. We are allowed to leave our homes, we are allowed to use our own discretion as to why and how long we need to leave our homes for. If people have the disease, but not critical, or they have been exposed, they are asked to self isolate/quarantine - but it is not a ""law"" there is no retribution or punishment for failure to comply (yet, at least). Also, voluntary (but I sure hope and pray they're taking is seriously). There is a real and psychological difference to a mandatory lockdown or quarantine. While I haven't left my apartment since last Sunday, I know I can. Each day, I made the assessment whether I will need to or not - so far so good. That is enormous freedom, and mentally comforting. If I knew that I could not go out by law, that would send me a little batty. The governor has also asked for the distinction of ""stay at home"" vs ""shelter in place"" (a distinction other governors have not recognized). He has preferred to use ""stay at home"" as he notes that ""shelter in place"" is the language used for what to do in active shooter cases, and is a more imminently threatening situation to avoid a specific danger. We are not ""sheltering in place,"" wherever we are, we are ""staying at home"" and if we go out, returning to our homes, not staying at the grocery store or wherever. Most people, including media, are ignoring the distinction. But for me, I appreciate that he is thinking through the various levels of executive orders he can issue, the various levels of freedom that he wants New Yorkers to feel they have, the voluntary aspect to good citizenship and safe practices, but at the same time, reserving the right to up the level of required behaviors if the need becomes apparent. To me, that thoughtfulness in his approach and analysis is what I appreciate about these rules, the careful distinctions. I am a stickler for that kind of factual difference.Delray Beach is now under curfew, 12am-6am. Most people won't be affected by that, it's clearly intended to stop partying. But psychologically, knowing that there's a curfew, people are affected."

"""Isn't the peak coming in the next 2-3 weeks or did Cuomo change that pronouncement?' yes that is when he expects the apex which is what he is trying to avoid. Initially they thought they had more time, but it accelerated. If it happens that is the point when hospitals are overwhelmed and they can't handle it.

As the death toll continues to climb there are still morons out there that think this is some media hoax. Still we need to ask where the heck are all the testing kits? We still don't have the needed testing kits. Less than a million have been sent out even though the federal government said it was sending out four million weeks ago. Its just depressing there is no accountability of government anymore.

Kaye. I tried reading that Contrarian article and couldn't get through it: I found it too irksome.
"#1094 Covid-19 is now a matter of politics and religion. Liberals take it seriously while conservatives not so much. There are southern megachurches that were packed on Sunday at the behest of their leaders. Liberty University, a Fawell enterprise, has just reopened.

"1095 - I watched it too and any good news was not coming from our supposed leader and his logorrhea.Fauci I trust but he's like someone who has to chase and clean up after a puppy that is not toilet trainedLogorrhea is not a way to communicate and govern responsibly.

"Do any of the locals have any insight as to when Broadway will cancel their shows further out? We have tickets for two separate shows that we were to attend in a few weeks, but Ticketmaster says they will automatically refund when the shows are canceled."
"@1101 What is a few weeks? In April? If so then its definitely being cancelled. Not sure when they will actually process the cancellations but I don't see any reason for them to wait any longer with it being announced that this all is being extended to at a very minimum April 30th. Even when things do come back I think Broadway shows and big events will be one of the last things to be allowed, so I would be doubtful of any Broadway shows in May as well."

"Jenn — I’ve found some tickets for March have been refunded quickly so far, others not yet. I’d expect cancellations through the end of April will be announced within the next day or so. And refunds after that will likely take no longer than 30 days. It really depends on the production/theater company etc. But overall, they’ve all been doing the right things. If you can, please consider go fund me campaigns to support the many workers in the theater & associated nearby restaurant communities who are being affected."

I wish we could help everyone, but it’s going to be a team effort from all of us."
"I'm not sure about processes needed for ticket cancellations between the venue, middleman and event goer But if any of the steps involve personnel in locations with workplace restrictions I'd guess that timely refunds may be hampered by that."
"Kaye—Ticketmaster said they would automatically refund tickets when shows are canceled, so we do not need to contact them. I bought the tickets for both of our shows through Ticketmaster, so I’m not sure how other ticket providers are handling it."
Just sad that Arizona waited until they had well over a thousand confirmed cases before they took action in the past hour or so. God knows how many people are actually infected there.

"@1154 Actually in the general pandemic guidelines from the CDC they do recommend masks. They aren't pushing that now because they don't want people rushing out to buy them. The purpose of the mask is not to keep you safe. Its to keep you from infecting others in case you have it and dont know it, so if everyone wears masks that would help reduce transmission. Got to have enough masks though before doing that."
Yes they aren't talking about the public using n95 masks. Those are in very limited supply and aren't really designed for walking around with plus they need to be fitted and most people won't wear them properly anyway. They are talking about people using the surgical masks .

#1273 - My heart always seems to skip a beat when that noise goes off.
CDC is now recommending face coverings when in public to slow the spread. Not N95 masks but non-medical masks.
Over here we saw a discussion in the media about citizens using masks. The problem with those non N95-masks seems the fact that they are not 100%. The virus is small enough to get through. That's why over here our health organization does not recommend those (non N95) masks as an alternative for citizens. It fears people with masks are gonna feel safe and release social distancing when in reality the are not 100% safe. Masks are no problem though as long as you still keep the social distance and use them correctly. Don't though the front when you put them off.
@1276 The point of the mask recommendation is that some people who may be asymptomatic if they wear the mask it will slow them from spreading it to others.

The virus is small enough to get through >>The real problem is that an N95 mask needs to fit tightly enough against your face to produce a seal. The typical member of the public doesn’t understand that and thinks that they can wear any N95 mask, and that is just not true! “1. Why is Respirator Mask Fit Testing required?Respirator mask fit testing and Respirator Protection Training is required in quite a few different fields of work. The most common field that requires fit testing is the medical sector. The reason being is if there is ever an outbreak of any sort, nurses and doctors should be able to grab a mask and go to work. They are exposed to a wide variety of viruses, sicknesses where masks help to protect them against anything that may be airborne.“ https:/…Anyone wanting to wear an N95 mask, and be truly protected, must be “fitted” by a trained individual to find their correct size. Medical care workers need to be “fit tested” before using them in a clinical setting, plus they must wear the same brand and size as the mask that was used to do their original fitting. In addition, testing needs to be done on a yearly basis to make sure that their mask still fits correctly, otherwise the N95 mask being worn by the health care provider may not provide adequate protection from small size particles, such as viruses. synergy-employment.com/services/n95-mask-fit…Any individual that hasn’t been properly “fit tested” might as well wear a typical, less expensive, surgical type mask and leave the N95 stockpile for those who really need that level of protection, eg when providing care such as suctioning a sick patient"
"I have family in Florida and some with underlying health conditions. You guys need to let up on what’s happening there. Here’s a map of where the cases are appearing:https:/…florida-coronavirus-cases.amp.htmlRemember that Miami hosted the Super Bowl in early February. That could be their Chinese New Year celebration in NYC or Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The governor of Florida is doing what every governor in the country is doing: protecting their state. All governors are trying to insure that hospital facilities will be available to their citizens if they need them, and the ships wanted to dock in Ft. Lauderdale, near the epicenter of the Florida cases. An international deal was struck that took care of the ship’s passengers and Floridians, and its likely to be a precedent for more ships that are out to sea and refused docking by other countries. Remember, these ships were denied docking through South America.What would you have wanted if those ships wanted to dock in NYC?"

A cruise ship that was supposed to end sailing in argentina two weeks ago. Shame on Argentina. People ended up dying on that cruise ship.
"The one on its way is the Coral Princess. The Zaandam and Rotterdam have already docked and had been sailing off the South American coast where they were denied docking. This is another ship that’s docking. California was not left on its own when ships with sick passengers onboard requested to dock. The Florida governor said that his state could not absorb and care for all of sick and exposed passengers that will pass through its ports. He needed to reserve beds for sick Floridians and there needed to be a national and international solution. He got it, and I dare say, Cuomo would have protected New York the same way. Nobody was inhumane and said, “Let them sail on and die.”"

We have snow equipment, but an event like this one is so rare that we don’t have the equipment to handle a storm like this. An official from a northeastern state came to our defense and said (sic), “If Kentucky had stockpiled that equipment, it would have rusted from disuse.” Similarly, the ventilator stockpile became antiquated and fell into disrepair, and they were auctioned. That inoperable stockpile would have put patients at risk and would have created a false sense of preparedness.

"""However, once the epidemic becomes widespread, testing ceases to be useful and does not impact treatment."" Don't really agree. Its important to know who has it and who doesn't at all times in a hospital setting. You can't put COVID patients in rooms with people who don't have covid and it is relevant for medical providers to know who has covid and who doesn't. You don't need to test the people who have mild symptoms that can isolate at home but in the hospital it is relevant. Also, the testing becomes very relevant once things slow down and we can move from mitigation back to targeted isolation an contact tracing. Testing has many uses and they have only limited it a bit because they don't have enough tests and PPE. Without adequate testing its very difficult for them to develop any overall strategies because they don't know where the virus is or is going."
More confirmed cases in New York than any country in the world. https:/…
"#1350, #1352, #1355All these scenarios can be true at the same time, and so testing needs to be done at different stages in a given community and under certain conditions.Very early on in a pandemic it’s essential to do case management of the few sporadic cases that pop up, ie trace and test ALL their contacts, as well as quarantine and isolate them as needed pending test results, in order to limit spread in a given community.Once the infection is widespread in a particular area, testing becomes a waste of money, resources, and manpower unless there is a safe effective treatment available, which is currently not the case with COVID-19. In this scenario, social distancing in the general community and isolation of cases is most effective overall, as long as the cases can self-manage their symptoms until they recover fully.For those whose symptoms required hospitalization, testing is beneficial to confirm the diagnosis in order to group COVID-19 cases together. This will help limit the spread to other uninfected inpatients, as well as help preserve PPE supplies.In any of the above scenarios the number of tests performed, and how quickly the samples can be processed, will be further determined by many factors: Availability of sampling kits, manpower, PPE, lab limitations as far as reagents, technicians, equipment, etc are concerned.Bottlenecks, as a consequence of any one of those factors, can lead to prioritizing who gets tested and when, but also which tests get processed first. The point is to use testing to dictate further clinical and public health management in any given area, state, country, etc. To be used most effectively, this approach requires planning, organization and cooperation at multiple levels.#1356 Sadly, there are states in the US that have thus far been relatively unaffected but will end up more like Italy, Spain and New York, rather than Germany and California, because they are not acting proactively to identify and isolate early cases and their contacts, thereby limiting and/or slowing down the early spread of COVID-19 in that state."
"#1350 testing never ceases to be useful. Testing is the key to controlling the virus. The countries that have been less impacted by this virus are the ones that tested and continue to test. Without testing, no one will know who is infected and with many infected not showing symptoms the virus will continue to spread and have a greater impact on life than at present."

I think he is exercising bad form by not being upfront with people in that regard.Whether you agree or not, he is going to have a lot of unhappy citizens if he keeps adding weeks to the pause without very clear justification and forward governmental action plan.I think outside of the NYC area the approach for containment by the powers that be has been far too passive and I don't see that changing until they minimally start testing more people.They certainly need to take a smart/cautious approach to reopening but they can't expect people to be on board with being shut in for weeks/months on end without a more aggressive and cogent approach. A pause of multiple months is not sustainable especially if people can't even apply for unemployment and/or get their ""stimulus"" check (which is way too low).

"Yes, not only is it not true big hospitals have 2 ICU beds, but the big hospitals in NYC often have multiple specialized ICU units. My late mother was in a roughly 10 bed surgical ICU at Weill Cornell at least twice, and that was certainly not the only ICU at that hospital. The only hospital I ever encountered with 2 ICU beds was the one at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital, which at the time had about 20 acute care beds, 20 long term care beds,and the 2 ICU beds."
"Red, how does CNN compare:https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/"
Nice try at deflection.
"#1362 ""if every person assumed they are positive and acted accordingly""You must have missed our own government department, CDC, statement that essential workers may be permitted to work following potential exposure to c-19, if they show no symptoms.Individuals may want to act accordingly but the government is telling them it is not necessary. Those who have not shown symptoms have been spreading the virus for months and will continue to spread forever if there is no testing."
"No deflection red. It seems that if someone posts a CNN link, that’s fine, even though they have the same mixed review as the source that I posted. But the link I posted gets dismissed because it’s from a right leaning source."
"When I was in NY Presbyterian Queens (535 beds) in Feb., I spent two days in the ""medical ICU"" that had perhaps 20 beds.

"I’ve been reading the New Zealand TA forum. Their lockdown has been very strict. They’re not opening soon, they know the stakes are high."
"Yeah there's talk here about going NZ style lockdown. People here are walking around stores that are open selling non-essential items - eg JB HiFi which sells entertainment stuff. It's a very crowded shop and they're not restricting the number of people going into the store. People - whole families - are admitting they're going cos they're bored at home.....ffs.And now with Easter, people are travelling to country towns....the locals in them are begging them to stay away.We've been so lucky so far in Oz...less than 7,000 have been tested positive for the virus and 52 deaths (less than 1% tested positive). And we seem to have flattened the curve. But one, two weeks from this weekend, I wonder if we'll see the numbers to go up again. I see the numbers in NYS and feel so sad.Edited: 9:59 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"Wow. This thread has grown so much. I’m on the Upper East Side. I went out today after not being out at al for about a week. (The sidewalks are so crowded, taking a walk is a little stressful if you think about 6 feet of space between people). It’s less relaxing to take a walk these days. Today, I was horrified to see at the end of my street that the bodega is closed. That is significant. Bodegas are a lifeline of the community. As I walked around, more restaurants were also closed, though some still offered takeout. Not many. Dunkin Donuts was closed, which is also significant. I got my groceries at Whole Foods mainly because they do a good job ensuring social distancing. The shelves were pretty well stocked, though not with paper products or bleach. I can’t find bleach anywhere. I have friends in the Village, where mail delivery has been impacted. The subway is also impacted. It is a difficult time beyond what we are seeing in the hospitals and with FDNY EMS. It is great that at 7pm each night my little street comes to life with cheers for medical staff, first responders, and essential employees."
Thanks for your post Caroline. Stay safe.
"That's nice to know Dunkin Donuts is still open on the UES. Where I live, in east midtown, they are either closed or open only limited hours, like until 2-3 PM.On the upside, at least one Starbucks near me has reopened, but only limited hours for pickup of online orders. You can't even go into the store. They bring it to the doorway. I have also noticed delis and restaurants that were opened for takeout last week closed this week. One supermarket has instituted one-way aisles."

"New Zealand is apparently the only country aiming for eradication goal with strict lockdown. Their low population, isolation and low infection case numbers make it much easier with 5 million population, current 1280 cases, 2 deaths and 25-50 cases increase daily.Australia with less strict lockdown is achieving the same increases currently with 25 million population, 6150 cases, 50 deaths and 25-50 increase daily.Both will likely be quarantine island fortresses with some relaxation of controls until a successful drug treatment or vaccine is found."
"I was looking at some of the revised flight schedules the other day and was trying to remember when in my lifetime there were this few flights. I thought maybe the mid-60s, when I was first flying, when there were maybe 3 flights a day to London on 3 different airlines (one each), but even then there were probably more flights to other places in Europe than there are now, and many more domestic flights than are currently operating.Edited: 11:18 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"I don’t know, I read that Greenland’s only cases have all been declared recovered, and several Caribbean islands are under total lockdowns, not allowing even citizens to return right now.

"On my online local newspaper's feed about the pandemic, there is a story about NYC using Hart Island (off The Bronx) as a burial ground. It will be used to bury New Yorkers with no known next of kin or whose family is unable to arrange a funeral.So so sad.Edited: 1:00 am, April 10, 2020 "
"""That's nice to know Dunkin Donuts is still open on the UES. "" I believe she said it was closed. A fair number of restaurants gave up on the takeout game and just closed down. Given the number of people losing their jobs etc I don't think it bodes well for restaurants."
"Hart Island has always been used as a ""potter's field."" Well maybe not always, but for a very long time. In the past few years there has been controversy over the City's not allowing people to visit it -- like relatives of people buried there (who sometimes learned only after the fact someone was there, the hospitals are sometimes so eager to get rid of bodies and so lazy when it comes to tracking down family, and this was before the virus). I believe those disputes were recently resolved and people either recently have started visiting or are about to start visiting. Note the burials are done by prisoners, and that was, as best as I can recall, one of the alleged reasons for keeping people away."
Yes it said in the article that lowly paid prisoners were doing the work.Thanks for giving more information.It explains this sentence in the article which I found very confusing:The city has used the strip of land belonging to the Bronx borough to bury New Yorkers with no known next of kin or whose family is unable to arrange a funeral since the 19th century.I would have put that last clause first....I couldn't work out how a family could be unable to arrange a funeral for all that time!

@1426 it felt more like deblasio just wanted time in front of the cameras by toying with this decision. It was not reasonable to think schools could reopen this year given the circumstances.

"nycforever #1411You probably are aware by now, since your post, and someone else might have posted it, that at 7pm nightly, #clapbecausewecare is a tribute to all those on the front lines of this horrible time the world is going through, at a great sacrifice to themselves and their families. There is clapping, shouting, musical instruments played, cow bells and pots and pans beaten. ""Clap Because We Care "" is being observed all over the country, not just NYC. It is a tribute to the devoted, professional exhausted, underprotected doctors, nurses, emts, grocery store workers, delivery people, other essential workers, and to those who work and volunteer in so many ways, to care for those who are so very sick, and help keep us safe and healthy. What started as a one or two night tribute, has become a nightly event in my neighborhood at 7pm, which I see and hear from my window. I believe it has continued in many neighborhoods around NYC, and in other cities as well."
It actually started in Europe I believe in Italy or maybe Spain. I remember watching them doing it before we even started having significant cases .

"@1440 I'm sure that certainly is part of it , but Chinese tourism to Italy was up a massive amount as well. The problem was the chinese government initially hid what was going on and people were moving all around infecting other countries.china.org.cn/travel/…content_75645234.htm"
"#1440 - Yes, the fashion industry connections make some sense as to why that part of Italy was a hot spot. However it is routine for American employees of low and moderate priced fashion brands to make regular trips to Asia. Some even have permanent offices in places like Kowloon staffed by a mix of locals and Americans."
"^^Without a doubt, Red.The outbreaks in Italy (as well as here in Canada) came around Chinese New Year when all the travellers: tourists and returning residents started to visit/return, with many having the US as their final destination,Here in Vancouver a good number of infected had connections to Iran.

"Regarding the delivery services: do all restaurants in NYC use those services? Here in the Netherlands there is ""Thuisbezorgd"" which is the biggest service and which is also known for asking rates that or too high. A lot of restaurants that didn't do delivery or take-away suddenly have to because of the lockdown. And at least our favorite places decided not to use such a service but bring the food to the customers themself. Just ordered two lovely steaks yesterday and the owner drove himself:)I hope they will survive the crisi and I hope the local places in NYC will as well. We would love to eat there when we visit, whenever that will be. I can imagine it is a battlefield in the business."
"@1446 We have a couple of services like grubhub, uber eats, door dash, etc. Many restaurants closed down because they weren't really setup to do takeout and its not profitable for them. Even a lot of the places I used to get takeout from are closed down. Lot of pizza places etc. I don't know if all restaurants that do delivery use those services probably not, but most of them do. I have seen some smaller places taking orders over the phone. The services take a pretty big cut for making the deliveries though and I have noticed a number of restaurants will inflate their prices on those services to offset that, so you pay that on top of the delivery fee.Edited: 2:21 pm, April 11, 2020 "

On top of that China was allowing ridiculous amounts of people to gather.They had like 20k people crammed shoulder to shoulder at one of their national parks. I don't see concerts, sporting events that can be attended and broadway shows returning anytime soon, but some return to work for people that can't work from home is likely. Restaurants might be allowed to open at a reduced seating capacity although that would probably be in the second stage of opening. My guess would be they would start doing this mid-may or end of may. This is all assuming that the number of cases keep dropping. If there is another spike and the numbers increase then all bets are off."

"***because some of the governors are complete clowns, but the regional groups will certainly work together because they are soo interconnected.***Some of the governors around here are clowns as well."
Someone needs to explain to Trump that the governors don't answer to him. He is announcing he is giving authorization to governors to reopen states at a time of their own choosing. Its nonsensical. They don't need his permission.

"""He said that if you’re running, wear or around your neck and raise it over mouth and nose as you approach people."" I only saw parts of it so I didn't see the section where he talked about runners. That doesn't seem like a workable solution when someone will have a neck covered with sweat and touching the mask taking it on and off just exposes you more. Maybe there are masks specifically designed for exercise although it wouldn't surprise me if they are sold out. Found a mask at the local pharmacy. Its supposed to be a one time use and they only sell one per customer. Even if you make your own you are supposed to wash them after each use which is difficult for those of us who don't have laundry in the building. I'm all for people wearing masks as much as possible but if you are going to start talking about civil enforcement of masks the government really should make sure masks are widely available in sufficient numbers. Its not healthy to keep using unclean masks as it can lead to infection and cause more problems."
"It is clearly evolving. He very specifically said that there is no enforcement mechanism at this time. They will consider civil penalties if there is a compliance problem. But as of now, it is an executive order with no penalty. He also said it doesn’t need to be a “mask” it can be a scarf/bandana. But that mouth and nose have to be covered."

"Trump’s ‘Opening Our Country Council’ Runs Into Its Own Opening Problemshttps:/…trump-coronavirus-economy-panel.htmlSome business leaders had no idea they were included until they heard that their names had been read in the Rose Garden on Tuesday night by President Trump. Some of those who had agreed to help said they received little information on what, exactly, they were signing up for. And others who were willing to connect with the White House could not participate in hastily organized conference calls on Wednesday because of scheduling conflicts and technical difficulties.Cisco Systems, the networking company, and McDonald’s were among the major employers that learned of their involvement in consulting with the president only when he mentioned their names on Tuesday evening, according to people familiar with the matter.Pfizer was also blindsided by its inclusion in the group, receiving a heads-up that Mr. Trump might mention the company an hour before the announcement, with no information about how many other companies were involved or what the purpose of the group was.Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., was also not asked whether he would join the group before his name was announced by Mr. Trump as a participant, according to Carolyn Bobb, the union’s national media manager.The pattern of confusion appeared to be repeating itself with members of the House and Senate who were abruptly notified that they had been selected for a congressional task force on reopening the country."
"Supply and demand Kaye, of course people are going to charge more than in January and February. Plus they are going to cost more from a third party vendor. It's kind of sad, you'd bitch if the administration did nothing, but when they actually come up with other vendors, now the price is too high. Is the glass half empty or half full."

A trip to the grocerySo this morning I decided to venture out for a few supplies. Scarf for mask + latex gloves. Have a substantial collection of vintage scarves and found a box of latex gloves leftover from a DIY project so can go for a long time without running out or reusing gearFewer people on the street than normal but not a ghost town. About half wearing masks / face coverings. Fairly normal amount of car traffic and Green cabs hanging out by the subway stop. None of the usual nodding acquaintances sitting on their porches or stoops. A few dog walkers and one runner. Drug stores and bodgeas open but didn't stop in.About half the restaurants closed - but it may have been too early for the places that don't serve breakfast. A few trucks making deliveries. Usual street vendors - breakfast and fruit - absent. Trash pick up happened on schedule. Went to the ATM. Was able to get the amount desired so apparently they are refilling the machines. Grocery store open shorter hours. Requiring customers wear masks. Metering the number of customers inside at one time - about a dozen in line outside when I went and didn't have to wait long. Still doing home deliveries - but warned to expect longer wait times than normal. Delivered promptly enough frozen food was OK. Able to get pretty much all I needed - but was an infill trip so didn't walk all the aisles. Sometimes not my preferred brand but no big issues. Tipped the delivery guys double what I usually do.

"Coronavirus clue? Most cases aboard U.S. aircraft carrier are symptom-freehttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…The Navy’s testing of the entire 4,800-member crew of the aircraft carrier - which is about 94% complete - was an extraordinary move in a headline-grabbing case that has already led to the firing of the carrier’s captain and the resignation of the Navy’s top civilian official. Roughly 60 percent of the over 600 sailors who tested positive so far have not shown symptoms of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, the Navy says. The service did not speculate about how many might later develop symptoms or remain asymptomatic."
"The average age of an aircraft carrier crew tends to be around 24 and the navy screens out a fair number of the underlying conditions prior to enlistment, so no real shock that there are a number who have not shown symptoms yet. It makes sense they would test everyone though, because one infected person will likely lead to an infection of most of the ship over time."
"1551 I'd also guess that medical experts might find full testing of the group could yield some useful data on how transmission spreads and progresses. Since they were all together on one ship they might be able to get a better idea of how it spread among work areas, roommates, mess hall etc. I'd guess there are records of work schedules and similar that can give clues if some smart people know how to properly analyze them"
@1552 They had all those passengers on those cruise ships so I don't know how much new information there would be to get from this in terms of the virus itself. If anything it will make the navy rethink their policies because they can't afford to have a single case slip aboard.
"This is a rather somber model for New York. Even with restrictions were are looking at around 30% of people being infected, although the hospitals aren't on track to be overloaded. https://covidactnow.org/us/ny"
"1553 ""They had all those passengers on those cruise ships so I don't know how much new information there would be to get from this in terms of the virus itself.""I'm not entirely sure either - and could be wrong - but it seems like a possible accidental experiment and they have some info that would be harder to get from leisure passengersThey have medical records on the sailorsThey seem pretty sure they know the port where the initial exposures happened.They presumably have records on where / when on the ship people worked and lived so that might be able to be used to map the progressionThey're active duty - not scattered to the four winds - so they can be debriefed on their movements on shore and in leisure time on the ship and contacts etc Might be able to see if there are some patterns that can be gleaned about timing, spread and who did and didn't get infected."
And to clarify I don't think this type analysis should / would take away from any clinical work that needs to be done and likely to be done by those who don't do front line medical work or lab work. Even if not immediately useful possibly eventually a topic worth reviewing.I read about John Snow once - the guy whose analysis of a cholera outbreak in London was supporting evidence of the validity of germ theory.

Aircraft carriers are often considered obsolete as they can be sunk so easily by a missile. Other countries have stopped producing them and often have no more than one if any. They are only useful when attacking inferior forces. What did Eisenhower say about the military-industrial complex?

Great article rjr in #1560. Here is another one with similar content:https://www.thestreet.com/markets/5-hidden-d…
"I agree that the article in 1560 is pretty good and worth reading. However it is essential to keep in mind that using hand sanitizers is NOT the best way to prevent transmission of the coronavirus; their use is advocated ONLY in a situation where it is impossible to wash your hands immediately, and correctly for at least 20 seconds. Washing your hands correctly for the average person does NOT require antibacterial or antimicrobial soap, in fact their use is discouraged for reasons mentioned in numerous articles, including the ones referenced in 1560 and 1563.Please, please, remember that in this current pandemic situation, if washing with plain soap and water is not possible in the moment THEN using a hand sanitizer is a good quick fix BUT you still need to wash your hands with soap and water at the first possible moment.Acceptable hand sanitizers include those with a minimum of 60-70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. Use of alcohol thankfully does not promote increased bacterial resistance. [“Another strength of alcohol is that the bacteria it kills don't develop a resistance to it, so alcohol doesn't lose effectiveness with continued use.” https:/…hand-sanitizer.html ]The CDC website has all you need to know at this time: https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html including when and how to wash your hands, https:/…when-how-handwashing.html , as well as information for the average person about when and how to use hand sanitizer, https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-… .Let’s stay safe and try to keep ourselves well, along with everyone else, by simply washing our hands as often as possible with soap and water."

1567 - I think the hand sanitizer shortage may be partly due to a panic buying herd mentality similar to what happened with toilet paper. Frequent use is probably also a way for some to feel they are warding off evil virusesIts use makes more sense in places like NYC than in car culture places. Here you have to use public or cab transportation at many times and finding pubic restrooms is a challenge in normal circumstances
@1567 If people are home or somewhere they have access to a sink and soap there is no need for hand sanitizer. I have some and I only use it when I need to go out for work and I don't have access to a sink with soap for more than an hour. I use it after coming out of subway etc. In terms of shelves being empty of hand sanitizer you should be sure to check with the staff. A lot of places have started keeping items like that behind the counter and limiting how much one customer can buy.
"#1567“ ...leads me to believe that the public is using hand sanitizer as a first choice instead of as a last resort.”Yes, I agree 100%. That’s one reason why I wanted to point out the above information."
"Some on the city council are pushing for a week long shutdown of the subway system and then having it closed at night. Here is a thought. If they have a problem with the homeless camping out on the trains then how about they do something about that instead of closing the system off? I doubt people are taking the subway for the hell of it at a time like this so its mostly essential workers and if you start making it difficult for them to commute you will have a cascade of effects as stores close down or severely limit hours due to lack of available staff. Shove everybody into car shares and taxis? Yea that seems like a good way to stop the virus... Not to mention do we really want to increase the amount of traffic on the roads when people are having a hard enough time social distancing on the sidewalks? Just seems like there are many more reasonable approaches that can be taken. Haven't seen anything that says the subway is the problem in itself, other than the fact that it gets crowded and lack of social distancing and part of that is from lack of trains.

"1571. - Hmm. I suspect that would be a logistical nightmare.IIRC, from a book on the history of the subway system that I read a while back, the trains run 24/7 because of size of the system. They have to run trains late nights so they are in position at the ends of the lines for rush hours to keep some sort of schedule. I guess they could run trains without passengers.I also wonder if those city councilmen were unaware that the homeless shelter in the subways in the winter or simply don't want to deal with the problem other than as a covid related issue. Perhaps they get driven places?"
@1572 yes its doubtful they ride the subway frequently much like the mayor.
"How are the thousands of hospital workers who are on duty at night supposed to get home without the subway? There are not enough taxis to carry all of them and they often do not live in Manhattan. Yes the homeless are a problem, but often mental health and drug addiction figures into things. Unless you are going to have forced institutionalization, nothing is going to change.

"There are so many things that will have to change in so many ways. The costs are extraordinary. Think of this: who wants to touch an elevator button in a hotel with people from all around the world bringing in their unique strains of the virus? Some buildings will retrofit elevators for voice activation for floor numbers. Some buildings could distribute those finger condoms (just what we need, more single use latex - and on Earth Day!). Most buildings (the smart ones) will limit the number of people in an elevator. But all of that requires insane amounts of planning, and alternate planning. And preparation. And re-thinking and reimagining. I just can't imagine a visit to a major world capital in the short term. It will take time to implement necessary changes across the board."

"I recently heard one medical person suggest that immunity to coronavirus after having it might last only three years. Of course, time tell if this is correct or not, but there are fears this will be a sort of chronic disease."
@1623 They don't really know about how long if at all the immunity will last but for other viruses its not uncommon for immunity to last 2 to 3 years. Something to keep in mind though is in 2 or 3 years we should likely have a workable vaccine. Its not guarantee but this virus is not mutating to the point that a vaccine is unlikely to work.
"""I gave my blood for an antibody study last week and am awaiting results"" would appreciate if you would report back the results of your test.

NYC has direct flights from Wuhan China so there is really no way it wasn't here much earlier than they initially claimed."
Kittygal - How did you get connected with the antibody study? Is that something Red might look into here?

That is what they are doing.
Red - Assume you weren't tested for the flu in January?I'd be inclined to call your doctor - or maybe 311 - to ask if there is someone investigating possible earlier cases. if your experience seemed atypical for the flu someone out there might be interested.

"Yes I expect commercial landlords will need to be much more reasonable on what they expect in terms of rent amounts. All this work from home stuff has likely really opened the eyes of many businesses that they don't need all the commercial office space. Not to mention I don't think people will be rushing back to brick and mortar stores anytime soon even once things reopen. People probably aren't going to flock to restaurants either. I also don't think lending will be that great for new businesses, so getting new businesses to rent out spaces is probably not going to happen on a large scale. Best thing for everyone involved from landlords to the businesses to the community where they are located is for landlords to be reasonable otherwise we will have neighborhoods with vacant storefronts everywhere which brings crime and people leaving the neighborhood."
"Commercial landlords are already talking about how they will need to retrofit buildings to adjust to the new reality. For example, who wants to touch an elevator button? Class A buildings will convert elevators to voice activation. But this may not be possible for Class B buildings and others. Employers were need to stagger worker hours to adjust to space issues Open space plans will now have to convert to partitions/cubicles/private offices. Conference rooms will be less necessary as people will elect video conferences instead of being in rooms with a lot of people. Every tenant is calling landlords very rent abatements. The smart landlords are taking any deal that offers cash flow in the short term and figuring out how to retrofit their buildings for the new reality. Ground floor retail will take a very, very long time to come back."
"Bathrooms will also have issues if elevator buttons are an issue - sink faucets, paper towel/hand blow dry buttons, toilet handles are among the things touched.I agree about conference rooms; we have been having skype meetings easily. Providing bandwidth to handle increased remote usage for things like skype will likely be another issue though probably not for landlords.Edited: 10:15 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"Most bathrooms in Class A office buildings are already contactless (although they will need to reinstall those Saran Wrap toilet seat covers that always jammed, and make them work). It’s the lesser buildings that will have to fix the bathrooms and other facilities. And they will have less available funds. I suspect there will be government programs or tax incentives or other methods to pay for it, not unlike “Leeds” certification or other “green” installations."

This information is helpful because you can see how the disease has progressed and how it is distributed throughout a state and region. It helps to understand why (or why not!) some governors are doing what they’re doing. Expect to see a rise in the number of cases outside of the northeast because testing outside of hospitals and to the very sick has just started in the rest of the country. The Abbot (rapid) test is the one now being used and while the tests are distributed nationally, testing sites and the set up of testing labs is a state and local task. The lab set up has been a bigger issue than most people realize, but they’re now ready to go. To get publicly accessible testing going, national retail chains like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid and Kroger have partnered with local governments, and since the end of last week, things have been revving up in Kentucky.

That supply may be being directed to the regions that have been the hardest hit and that’s reasonable. When we need to venture out, we can get into our cars and go. NYC is different. The problems with social distancing in an elevator or street corner is not something most of the country has to address. My source is my and my healthcare providers in Kentucky, public and private. I’m a heart patient (doing well!), but I want an antibody test before I head back to New York. I’ve been talking to the hospital system I use and last week, they told me that they have just become able to administer the the viral test to patients beyond the most ill and hospitalized patients. The hospital system couldn’t give me an antibody test, but my doctor could possibly request one. This is not a pressing issue at this time. I’m healthy and I can wait, but my doctor can request an antibody test if the test isn’t readily available before I head back to NYC."

"Interesting article Kaye though I disagree with its vision of what will be. People don't necessarily flock to a place because of cheaper rents. I live in one of the most affordable housing markets in the US and the population here has dropped over the years. Also, there are many of us who eschew chains and Amazon and so mom and pop shops will still have their place. I do think there will be a trend towards growing ones own food or directly from a farmer.The article also seems to paint the US with a singular brush and assume everyone will have the same reaction in the aftermath of the virus. People in areas that were much less impacted are likely to have a different mindset than people in hard hit areas."
"1704 - Agree it's more nuanced but interestingIMO things like the number of artist/creatives that have gone to Detroit in recent years are interesting. Artists are always among the first wave of gentrifiers. Think SoHo, Tribeca etc.Mom and pops certainly have have a place - but a more vibrant one in places where they can afford the rent and make a living and maybe be a bit experimentalDoubt if too many people who were not already gardening will do much more than be a blip on google trends with ""victory gardens"" searchesCSA's make some sense but have the same last mile problem as other e-commerce"
"I think the article makes some valid points, although its certainly not applicable everywhere or even to all cities. A lot of people who have the option to live elsewhere live in NY in part for the convenience of everything. If you can't go out to restaurants for a prolonged period of time, if you can't go to major events, large museums, broadway shows etc the city becomes a whole lot less appealing. There are a lot of downsides to living in New York from cost of living, to limited space, to having to deal with a crowded mass transit that is going to be risky, to higher crime risks just because it is a large city etc. I can totally see a large number of people who have the option relocating to more suburban or rural areas. I have had many friends (some who were born here) that had enough and left the city and that was before all of this. I would expect this would dramatically accelerate the trend."

Has anyone in NYC gone to one of the urgent care centers for antibody testing?

"#1722: I suspect there will definitely be a “fee for the lab work”.These new rapid antibody tests that are being promoted use a small portable machine similar to the Abbott ID NOW Machine. There may not be a cost for the medical personnel obtaining the sample, but there will be a cost for performing the antibody test. I don’t know how Medicare and Medicaid work but I can’t imagine that the NYS government will be purchasing new machines at this time, for this purpose, because of the costs, nor can I imagine that hospital and clinic labs will perform the antibody tests without expecting to be reimbursed for the costs of machines and test materials.Tests will probably cost at least $50 US, since the antibody testing machines are the same type of machine that is used to do rapid testing for diagnosing Strept or Influenza, described here in this Sept 2019 “Nature” article, https:/…d41586-019-02754-7 . [“Despite the benefits of rapid molecular tests, hospitals and health systems have been slow to buy them.

Whereas RIDTs cost about US$15 per test, rapid molecular tests can cost up to $45 — a financial burden that many health-care providers, both public and private, would struggle to bear. Rapid molecular testing also requires a hefty initial investment in a testing platform, such as Cepheid’s GeneXpert Xpress or Abbott’s ID Now. “Right now, everyone has to make the case to their hospital system because of the added costs,” Anderson says.”] Under our health care system in Canada these tests are free of charge for all citizens as their costs are covered by our provincial taxes. I can’t speak to the cost of the Abbot machine but a similar machine produced in Canada, being purchased by our provincial governments to do rapid diagnostic tests for the COVID virus, will cost $10,000 CDN per machine and $75 CDN per test. These portable machines are currently being used here to dramatically increase the number of diagnostic tests that can be done to identify COVID-19 positive individuals (our provincial public healthcare systems feel it is too early to start widespread antibody testing at this time) but the same type of machines will likely be used down the road to do antibody testing, so the costs should be similar.Edited: 10:15 pm, May 01, 2020 "

"#1732, 1733 I’ve posted below comments I made on another thread ...I agree that one would expect the total number of cases to be high in the USA because its total population is high relative to the majority of countries mentioned. However, the outbreak in many of those countries started earlier and have peaked, for lack of a better word, so their per capita number for cases and for deaths are going to remain more stable with the passage of time.This stability in the numbers is not likely to be the same situation in the USA because, as of this point in time, the very large number of cases and deaths in the USA “hot spots” are being divided by the large total “national” population figure, which in turn brings down both the case and death per capita rates listed for the USA on sites like Worldometers Info: https:/…countries Instead, if one looks at the NYT tracking site, https:/…coronavirus-deaths-by-country.html , it appears that the “case” and “death” rates today (May 3rd) are significantly higher in the USA compared to every other tracked country, despite the fact that the pandemic has yet to impact large areas of the USA.If the current situation persists in time, the per capita case and death numbers for the USA will continue to increase while those same figures will continue to stabilize in other countries, given that other countries are maintaining increased social distancing practices even as individual American states are “reopening” before the pandemic has reached that state."

Fear mongering? Huh? Its data from the CDC. The IHME has also revised their numbers as well and now they are indicating the death toll by August as near doubling initial estimates and at 134k+. Scientific models are not fear mongering. They are wakeup calls. The numbers are changing because states are opening up.

"You do understand the IHME model is one often touted by the white house right and that is mainly because they are overly optimistic with their numbers. Where was it last week? They had to rerun the models when states started opening up because their initial models had states social distancing for longer. The experts have been saying that its too soon to open up, so I don't understand the implication that somehow they withheld this information from the public. Dr. Brix recently said: """"Our projections have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost,"" . ""And that's with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance."" With states opening up obviously that is not full mitigation. Unfortunately Trump was going around pushing a much lower rate. Texas just had four straight days of 1k+ new cases each day. None of this should come as a surprise.

"i think Cuomo's plan for NY is fine and many other governors seem to have good visions for what it will take to have their states reopen.

They chose to take this punitive route in presenting the unreviewed and internal CDC information in a grim light which adds to the already scary situation. And scary only covers those not impacted by deaths, sickness and economic fragility.I also think model data is subject to error as we have already observed.Edited: 6:55 pm, May 04, 2020 "

I prefer not to reopen just because people are impatient only to be shutdown in a few weeks when the hospitals get overwhelmed and there are bodies in the hallways. Then all of this would have been a waste. We have seen what works in other countries like South korea and taiwan. Things need to be brought under control to the point with adequate testing so that new cases can be isolate and there can be contact tracing etc. I believe this is what Cuomo is trying to push for. Some other states are just charging ahead as their numbers are on the upswing.

@1763 The study is real. Nothing in that article suggests its not real. The white house is arguing the numbers are off because they are based on what happens if we don't have social mitigation and states open up. Of course states are opening up and in some places there isn't significant social mitigation. The IHME model is still showing a near doubling of deaths by early August and I don't see the white house disputing that and the IHME has routinely underestimated the numbers.
"From the article:""These preliminary results are not forecasts, and it is not accurate to present them as forecasts,"" the school of public health said in a statement.""Edited: 10:11 pm, May 05, 2020 "
"Right and you posted ""NYT unreviewed dire forecast found to be not real:"" That is NOT what the article said."
It is but OK.
Again the IHME model shows near doubling of deaths by early August so I don't really see the point of this. States opening up before they are ready even according to the white house's own guidelines is going to greatly increase the death toll. Any legitimate expert is projecting that. The death toll today has topped 71k in the US.
Warning signs for unknown syndrome impacting children.https:/…
"#1770This is important information [above link] for everyone to be aware of as there seems to be many reports like this coming out. Apparently they’re not sure yet whether it is something directly caused by the new coronavirus OR as a result of the body’s immune system reacting to the serious infection.Most children seem to have fairly mild cases of COVID-19, but something like Kawasaki Disease, which is pretty rare, might be the explanation as to why a few children get very sick. One of my son’s friends had Kawasaki Disease when he was 5 years old and he almost died. Thankfully he recovered completely but some children go on to develop long lasting heart problems.====> Anyone out there who has themselves had Kawasaki Disease, or a relative who has had it, should be on high alert for their child to develop this condition if they have been recently diagnosed with, or seem to have symptoms of, COVID-19.From the NIH website, https:/…synonyms :”A predisposition to Kawasaki disease appears to be passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern is unknown. Children of parents who have had Kawasaki disease have twice the risk of developing the disorder compared to the general population. Children with affected siblings have a tenfold higher risk.” “The causes of Kawasaki disease are not well understood. The disorder is generally regarded as being the result of an abnormal immune system activation, but the triggers of this abnormal response are unknown. Because cases of the disorder tend to cluster geographically and by season, researchers have suggested that an infection may be involved. However, no infectious agent (such as a virus or bacteria) has been identified.”"

Not to mention the survey doesn't account for other people they live with who may be more frequently going in and out. Nor does it account for what precautions they took when going out. Its interesting but they need to do an actual study and really dig down to determine what is going on vs a quick survey. May mean that going to the grocery store is way more dangerous than people initially realized. It stands to reason that the people who are getting hospitalized for the most part are the high risk group people and it makes sense that those people would be the most likely ones to try to avoid going out as much as possible.Edited: 11:35 pm, May 07, 2020 "

Re. the white collar companies -Being able to have employees stay home long term depends on the nature of the business but I agree that such companies are mandating working from home as much as business need allows. I have been able to WFH since mid-March and that will continue for awhile and that is generally the case with the people in my work group. I went in to the facility yesterday (masks are mandatory) for a volunteer activity and was surprised at the number of cars on site whose owners were no doubt there because of business need.
"My guess re: the White House is that aides aren’t wearing masks, for one thing, as Trump doesn’t like the optics. I would also have to wonder how strict they are about social distancing and limiting contact, as again the occupant of the WH doesn’t really believe in those things. Plus people do go home at some point."
"1800 - I inclined to think we're at the beginning of a reevaluation/evolution of WFH that will be accelerated by the current unintentional experiment. As companies / workers see the benefits / trade offs I think it will gain more favor where technologically possible. Less need for office rent, less time wasted on commuting, ability to employ talent that does not want to relocate, better work/life balance for those disciplined enough to get it done remotelyThe first person I met that did WFH was about 20years ago - an engineer with expertise in a very specialized area who lived in a passive solar house on a ranchette hundreds of miles away from his employers in a community where his spouse had a job and family connections that was important to her.In my own experience - WFH has been viewed with skepticism by supervisors who worry about productivity from the ""unsupervised"", WFH workers who think physical absence from the office leaves them out of the loop on the grapevine for networking and promotion enhancing face time opportunities and co-workers who sometimes perceive the WFH'ers as slackers. The first one-day-a-week WFH'er in my work group was a notorious slacker with good political skills and was resented by most. The performance metrics eventually caught up to them and derailed the option for others for a while .IMO partly depends on the corporate culture and it's ability to hire, trust and empower responsible people who can work as functional teams"
#1802:I agree. Our management has been extremely supportive and proactive about allowing us to WFH. And the corporation took steps to account for the much heavier VPN load - meetings done by Skype or Zoom have been relatively seamless and made the experience (a new for me) a good one.

With much of the world closed for business, and no widely available vaccine in sight, it may be months, if not years, before airlines operate as many flights as they did before the crisis."

I imagine the population density in Wisconsin is very low compared to places like New York City, northern Italy etc where the virus spread so quickly just by virtue of the population density and vulnerability. If managed well by government and public health authorities the knowledge gained by following Wisconsin closely could be very useful to other parts of the country."

They may end up with a total free-for-all, as the legislators and governor are in a very toxic relationship, the background of which I won’t get into, lest it go down another political rabbit-hole. Plus there is a whole northern Wisconsin vs southern Wisconsin divide. Similar to areas not wanting NYC residents to relocate, they told vacation owners, many from Illinois, not to travel to their second homes in places like Door County and Lake Geneva, and people ( like my cousin) are hopping mad."

This has encouraged customers to book speculative trips — reserving the option to take a vacation in the late summer or fall, locking in a favorable price as airfares and hotel rates have fallen, and knowing they can cancel the whole thing if pandemic conditions continue to make travel inadvisable.1881 Kittygal, - Yea people like the ""treasure hunt"" aspect of those kinds of stores which use marketing messages to encourage frequent visits.

"It’s a particularly well written article Kaye, as it covers some aspects behind the scenes which is often missed completely in travel related articles. Especially the aspect about hotels having to go through what they did in March all over again, if it doesn’t return back to normal in time. Thank you for sharing that.I actually did a 6mth snapshot compset forecast of rates across the grid in NYC for a friend over there, and many of the rates are still default - it’s way way too high under the circumstances. Whilst many hotels may believe that people will jump at the opportunity to travel, the industry as a whole are skeptical about it being so robust - even if restrictions are completely relaxed. A fair chunk of the published rates are within the typical median range for Oct/Nov, although there are a number who are indeed showing lower rates.Hotels have only two strategies when business resumes, either to maintain ‘normal’ rates and hope domestic travellers bite, or to incentivise a higher occupancy through reduced rates compared to normal for that time of year. I’m of the firm opinion that the latter is much much more likely to succeed in the short to mid termEdited: 12:20 pm, May 15, 2020 "

Only 9 states met the recommended re-opening daily rate—mostly large and rural with relatively small populations such as Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming.4.

"After 9-11, it was predicted no one would want to be in a tall building again. Look at how many have been built since then. The city has had its good times and bad times. The flight to the suburbs in the 1950s brought many changes. This culminated in the crisis of the 1970s with high crime and city debt. They were my early years in NYC and I must say the place has continually become better since then. Businesses in Soho and on lower Broadway were closed on weekends. Soho was unsanitary and reeked in the summer. Porn shops were all over Times Square and even on 42nd St. across from the library. The area around the Port Authority Bus Terminal was to be avoided. I suspect younger people are unaware how bad things were in those days."

"Guidelines for reopening Broadway, still in the early phases:https:/…"
"I think it's important to note that those ""guidelines"" for reopening Broadway are the guidelines of Actors Equity Association, the actors' union. There are other parties involved -- especially the producers. And I don't think Broadway will reopen until there are social distancing rules the producers can live with."
@1992 Agreed. Broadway isn't scheduled to reopen. A number of people in the industry don't even believe it will reopen in 2020. September is merely a placeholder date and they will reassess as the date approaches. There is no officially scheduled reopening date for broadway.
IATSE - The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees - is a larger stronger union than Equity and will have opinions.
"All the unions will have a say in how things will be when they reopen, but, bottom line, it's the producers who decide if the show goes on. I know the producers are already talking to the unions, but what the producers really want is a relaxation or change in social distancing rules. They have already made clear the show will not go on with those rules as they are now."
"Broadway theaters are known for their small and cramped seating. Reducing the audience to half would probably be unprofitable. Also, tourists make up the bulk of ticket sales, especially females. If the theater powers that be do not see tourism picking up, they may not try to reopen."

Magnolia Bakery is about to be the first restaurant in the country to install a potentially disease-destroying far-ultraviolet light:https:/…

"I worked in a lab for 40 years where the cabinets used for sterile work as for growing cells was sterilized after hours with a UV light. Now there are different wavelengths of UV light and what was used is likely not the same as this new product. UV works by damaging dna and rna. The length of exposure makes a difference as well. While this UV door entry system might kill things on clothings, it is not going to kill the virus in an infected person's lungs. For some years, hospitals have used UV air circulators in public areas to reduce spread of diseases such as TB. These do not shine so you can see the light source. NYC water is sterilized with UV lamps to kill parasites that are resistant to chlorine."
"From the article that was provided in post 2001 and again here:https:/…“There are three classes of UV light: UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.UV-A and UV-B light cause sunburns and premature skin aging, and exposure to both is associated with the development of skin cancer. UV-C light, which has the most energy of all three types, is the most harmful, but it fortunately doesn't reach the Earth's surface because our atmosphere absorbs it. There's man-made UV-C light, too: It's what's in the UV light sanitizers that companies claim kill the coronavirus. According to the National Academy of Sciences, it's probable that this is true, because UV light has been used to disinfect surfaces and water for a long time, and it's generally successful. It works because UV-C light is strong enough to destroy the genetic material -- either DNA or RNA -- of viruses and bacteria.”|||#2008 “While this UV door entry system might kill things on clothings, it is not going to kill the virus in an infected person's lungs.”Of course it won’t but that doesn’t mean some individuals won’t promote an idea to that effect, and that others won’t believe them! At this point in time, without further studies, this is at best a gimmick but at worst it might be harmful to patrons, imo."

Nearly 50,000 people in the region have tested positive for the coronavirus in the last two weeks.’‘“Workers on the front lines and their families are still getting hit hard. People who spend hours every workday around strangers naturally have more chances to get exposed to the virus, doctors said. “The majority of people, it’s health care workers, it’s M.T.A. workers, it’s postal workers,” Dr. Sylvie De Souza, chief of the emergency department at the Brooklyn Hospital Center, said in an interview in mid-May.’|Interestingly, one of our local channels yesterday had a report about a recent study showing that the spread of the virus could be decreased if masks were consistently worn at home BEFORE someone in the household became sick!

"DeltaWing, I really had an issue with some of my friends with kids who were going back between divorced parents, especially when there were new boyfriend/girlfriends/spouses who also had kids going back and forth - that's transmission between at least 3 family units. I made my thoughts on that clear to some of my personal friends, regardless of whether they wanted to hear it. Certainly families transmitted among themselves in their homes, but add in the travel factor and extended families, it certainly widened the spread."
"Risa, that would be a real concern for me as well, and I too would have said something to friends and family members in that type of situation. We no longer have young kids in our own home, but my husband and young adult son continue working from home, so I’m the one who goes out to do all the necessary errands. In fact, I just got back from grocery shopping, and also stopped to put gas in the car, and even though the majority of people in my extended neighbourhood have been incredibly conscientious, there are the occasional ‘personalities’ that do cause some concern. As much as I dislike wearing masks—I always wear one when I’m out—I would force myself to wear a mask at home too, if the local situation was more worrisome and I thought it would keep my husband and son safer."

I can't imagine what that is going to do to commute times if thousands of commuters on LI and in CT, NJ and Westchester abandon trains and start driving to work.I wonder if there are even enough parking spaces for them.I also wonder if CDC is going to take a similar position on planes -- that is, avoid them."
Cuomo announced that NYC will move to Phase 1 of reopening on June 8th.https:/…

If you look at a map of worst hit neighborhoods in NYC you will see many are areas with people in very dense living spaces -- areas where 10 or 12 immigrants, or more, may share a 1 or 2 bedroom apt, areas where there are many multigenerational families, etc. Transmission may be between strangers,I guess it has to be to get into the home in the 1st place, but I think it is less common. Note that when they do contact tracing I believe they only ask you to identify people with whom you have spent at least 15 minutes."
