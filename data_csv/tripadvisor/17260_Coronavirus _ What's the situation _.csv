But with the new emergence of the virus in Italy anything can happen.But right now, at this moment, there is nothing to be excessively worry about in France. We are all concern and we should all continue to follow the storyand keep up to date.It's been said over and over that the best way :Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth to avoid contaminating yourselfPractice respiratory hygiene. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.At the end of all this, if you are too scare will you be able to enjoy your trip ?

"For international tourist, if we catch the corona virus and have to go to hospital, are we liable for the costs?"
I would imagine so. Why wouldn't you be?
"Thanks for posting this message. We are supposed to be in Paris at the end of March. Right now we don't really imagine cancelling are trip but are taking a ""wait and see"" attitude. It seems that while the Corona virus is exponentially deadlier than the flu, it still is a more significant issue for the very young / old or immune compromised. What we are really anxious to asses is the possibility that we could get stuck and not be able to enter the U.S. Hopefully we wills still be able to take our dream trip!"
"Thank you for creating a sticky for this topic. We're one of many who planned a Paris (and Budapest) t trip for May this year. Currently we're taking a 'wait and see' attitude until April. But since two of us have underlying health conditions which make us more susceptible to this virus we probably will end up canceling in the end. Unless things improve greatly by April but that's hoping for a lot as it's not too far off. Anyway, it's just our airline tickets we have to worry about as they're non-refundable; our hotels may be canceled easily.Edited: 2:00 am, February 28, 2020 "
Thank You Very Much OP!!
"Planner, I appreciate all your work on this. It could affect lots of people's travel plans including ours, so I'm trying to keep up to date."
"Thank you very much for this post. It would be great if it stays at the top. I am supposed to be flying this Monday and I am debating whether or not to travel. Since my flight is in the evening, I will decide Monday late morning, depending on the current up-to-date situation. I want to know if all museums in Paris are open as usual? Thanks"
"I imagine if you have travel health insurance, you should be covered."
One thing to consider is if the situation happens to get worse suddenly and one is stranded abroad. You have to decide what's best for your situation. But for us personally being stranded indefinitely abroad is as scary as getting ill. Good luck to us all.
Here's an interactive map showing worldwide cases of the Coronavirus in real time:https:/…
"""For international tourist, if we catch the corona virus and have to go to hospital...""You asked about the costs but in case anyone is wondering the current advice in France from the official government health website they do not want anyone with symptoms to go anywhere, specifically to places like hospitals, doctor's offices, emergency rooms. And presumably places like a police station that will have the potential of being put on lock down, and police stations we should all agree don't need this burden.The google translation from the official website:For anyone who has stayed in China or in an area where the virus is actively circulating * in the previous 14 days- Monitor your temperature twice a day- Wear a surgical mask in the presence of your entourage and outside the home- Reduce non-essential activities (cinema, restaurant, parties, etc.) and frequentation of places where people with disabilities are found (hospitals, maternity hospitals, accommodation establishments for the elderly, etc.)- Wash your hands regularlyIn case of fever or feeling of fever, cough, difficulty breathing:- Quickly contact the SAMU center 15 by reporting your trip- Do not go directly to the doctor or to the hospital emergency room+From the link above it appears the US and France have about the same infections at this moment, 64 & 57 cases.Edited: 6:50 am, February 29, 2020 "
The number of cases in France has tripled in the last 2 days to 73 and might double again before the weekend is finished.Tomorrow's semi marathon in Paris has been cancelled.
"France has now already passed the 100 mark. ""Is it safe to travel to Paris?"" Of course it is, if all of the pickpockets, petition girls and bracelet guys are feeling unwell."

"Thank you for these links.  I wish someone would tell these guys they have nothing to worry about. According to Rush Limbaugh it's nothing more than a common cold and Trump says it's all a hoax to bring down his administration (tongue in cheek for those who cannot tell, but both of these things were actually said). I am far more concerned when I read things in the French media than in the US media. I think many Americans don't believe much of anything that comes from the Trump administration. Truly a great tragedy and, in fact, a grave danger, in times like these."
"missmarleygirl, I do agree with you that there is a disparity between what you see on mainstream news and the hundreds of videos coming out from Wuhan China.When you and others post on this forum that this problem is grossly underrated and is much worse than the common cold I agree whatever this is it is nothing common about it based on those videos. If you watch any of those videos from citizens living in Wuhan have sent out to the world the only conclusion is the same. I am surprised the left hasn't capitalized on those testimonial videos.It may explain why you say the French news and what they are doing over here regarding closures and quarantine is better.."
"I saw that today (Sunday) the Louvre did not open as workers didn't feel adequately protected against the threat of the virus. Hopefully this situation resolves itself soon, as we travel in a few weeks."
"Louvre still closed at the moment, but important to note that the museum was not officially closed by the government. It is a labor issue as the museum workers (with good cause) are demanding better protection against the risk of infection from visitors. So discussions are ongoing with hopes that it can be resolved soon....Louvre remains closed, Paris Book Fair cancelled over Covid-19rfi.fr/en/france/20200302-culture-takes-hit-…"
Two deaths reported in France. More here: https:/…AC1-billion-per-month
"With all due respect to those who have been infected and those who have died, this is more hysteria than deadly disease. It is as infectious as the flu and only marginally more deadly. I don't see people in a full panic over flu season. I think good handwashing and common sense goes an awful long way."
">>It is as infectious as the flu and only marginally more deadly>>From what I'm reading, the transmission rate is unknown (not enough information to make an informed estimate, although there are preliminary guesses) and the case fatality rate (percent of symptomatic people dying) is estimated at around 2% compared to around 0.1% for the flu.Where are you getting your information?"
#24-how is this hysteria? Current data shows it to be much more deadly than the flu:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/0…What's the source of your information?
">> I don't see people in a full panic over flu season<<Perhaps that is because flu vaccines are available each year to help give people some measure of protection against the most serious complications from infection? That gives many people the luxury of not fearing influenza as previous generations did. So we no longer see the number of deaths that historically occurred during serious flu epidemics of the past.(my grandmother’s sister died in the 1918 flu epidemic, we all get flu vaccinations every year, and if you don’t you should.)When there is a vaccine available against this new Coronavirus, we can all be less concerned. But for now it is a much greater risk than the flu because we have no immunity.Edited: 1:51 pm, March 02, 2020 "
British Airways is cancelling some flights to Paris. https://www.thelocal.fr/20200301/latest-numb…
"Looks like BA is cutting all around; >>In total the airline said it was cancelled 226 flights between March 16th and 28th to destinations including New York, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland.<<I wonder how much of this is people cancelling and how much is precautionary."
"I think these flight cancellations may reflect recent major cut-backs in business travel. Major corporations and law firms in both Europe and the US have suspended almost all international travel, and many conferences and other planned business meetings have been cancelled or postponed."
"Today's update (Tuesday)The Louvre is closed, because it always is on TuesdaysTwo clusters have been identified. One in the Oise, not far from Paris, the other in the Alps. In those areas (and only there) they have cancelled school (lots of young people, who are high risk) and mass services (lots of old people - also high risk). I think they have alssso cancelled farmers markets, but grocery stores remain open.Gatherings of more than 5000 are still cancelled.I have seen stores with signs explaining their staff will not shake hands or kiss you on your cheeks. Other than that, life is moving right along. A little perspective – The Coronovirus has almost reached epidemic levels in France, but the common flu has been an epidemic here since November!!! Epidemic is a threshold of percentage per capita. That is all. And yes, the moment there is a vaccine, the panic will go away.Edited: 5:43 am, March 03, 2020 "
I hope the French Open isn't cancelled. I have been planning my trip for a year. Just have to wait it out and see if there's a decline in Coronavirus cases in the next 9 weeks. Fingers crossed.
"Yes, but the symptoms for those under 80 and who don't have weakened immune systems are on a par with flu symptoms. From The Guardian: ""The mortality rate is around 2% in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere.."" We are wise to be careful, but the fact that we can see this spreading in real time via the Internet makes it scarier than it really is. Hysteria is being ginned up, and panic only makes things worse.Edited: 12:01 pm, March 03, 2020 "
We have plans to stay a few nights at the Hotel La Bourdonnais on our way to Germany the end of this month...worried the hotel would quarantine all guests if *anyone* appears to have COVID-19. Also worried that while we are there the CDC will place France on their travel advisory list. Other than that we still want to go!
"Well, we ended up canceling our Paris/Budapest visit. Air France posted yesterday that tickets booked on or before March 31, 2020 may rebook or cancel & receive a voucher good for one year. Everyone has a personal feeling on how to approach their upcoming travels, and for us we feel more comfortable postponing ours."
i came across this post. Maybe this will help.https:/…

Next month’s Paris Marathon has now been “postponed”....https:/…
Agree with poster #39. I understand that coronavirus is many times worse than flu because of the pneumonia. The worst thing is it's spread about 2 weeks prior to the victim showing symptoms. Where I live they've reported two separate cases of coronavirus in the city now. One 90 year old in serious condition and one 40 something year old in fair condition. There's a public high school not far from my neighborhood. They've shut it down temporarily as one of the student's parents is being treated for the virus. No doubt it's the 40 something year old. It spreads rapidly.
can anyone update hows the situation there as my travel dates are 2 weeks from now?
"More than 500 cases reported in France as of today, with nine deaths. Story here: https://www.thelocal.fr/20200305/latest-numb…If I were going to Paris tomorrow I would probably cancel my trip. Since my trip isn't until May, still waiting to see how things pan out .This virus spreads very, very quickly."
thank you very much
Have anyone try to contact Eurostar to see if they would waive fees for changing travel dates? I have tried to contact them without success. They kept saying that they are not affected at this time.
Where do you live?
i am from toronto but i will be in paris from 15 to 20 of march
Chandrika what airline? I'm also traveling around the same time as you. I'm flying to London than using the Eurostar to go to Paris. I talked to air transat and so far Paris flights are not being considered for flexibility changes.
"I did not see this link posted, but they seem to be more current then WHO or the CDC.https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"
"We,re meant to be going end of April, really hope things have settled by then :("
France is now up to 1000 cases. Paris itself is not at all the most affected area.
"I was planning a trip to Paris March 13-20 but have cancelled amid the Coronavirus hysteria. I work in healthcare and with all of the information that is available, this is the prudent thing for me to do. The French government currently has France as a Level 2 travel advisory but for terrorism and civil unrest , while the US CDC currently does not have any travel advisories for France. The link below shows the advisory and a recent 3/8/20 post about Coronavirus which includes that France has 900 + cases . Everyone has to make their own decision and take risks into consideration . https:/…France.html"
"""Coronovirus hysteria"" makes it sound like it is not a real problem. Shouldn't you have written ""coronavirus information"" instead?"
"Well, it is hysteria. There is information too, but a lot of what's out there is hysteria.I'm not saying that coronavirus isn't a problem, but I don't expect it to be the end of the world either. That said, if I was older, had health problems, or lived with someone who was immunosuppressed or had chronic illness, I might not travel. I think the real problem traveling is going to be travel restrictions and places closing. When or how much of a problem that will be, I don't know."
"We have reached the deadline for our wait-and-see approach and have cancelled our trip to France, which would have started tomorrow. My husband and I are elderly with some health issues that may (or may not) have caused problems had we contracted the virus. Add to that the escalation of the virus in France and the tremendous uncertainty of what travel restrictions might be in place at the end of our planned 2-week trip made cancellation the right decision for us. Our plane tickets remain useable for a year from the time of purchase but we will lose about $900 (U.S.) in change fees, which will not be waived. Currently, we plan to make this postponed trip later in the year."
"France has just banned gatherings of more than 1,000. There go my tickets to the Philharmonie."
"Glad I stopped by to read Paris posts for the day - as I was just going to buy tickets for Orchestre Philharmonique. We always include live music on our travels to Paris and elsewhere so this is quite the disappointment. Our trip is almost 4 weeks and under lots of pressure as we are also travelling to Budapest and Madrid by air and rail to Prague in April and May. Things are a mess. We bought European AXA Schengen insurance for medical emergency but who knows what will happen if there is a problem whilst we are in Europe ... assuming our Norwegian Air flight out of LAX to CDG is not cancelled and we arrive into CDG. Today I was also going to book the train from Budapest to Prague - but that may be problematic as well - maybe we will be sick or the trains are cancelled or reduced. Welcome to flying by the seats of your pants - anything can go wrong and likely will so have Plan B, C and D ready so you can roll with the punches."
"France is now at Stage 2 - so trying to limit the propagationFrance has been at stage 2 - pre epidemic - since February 28th and public health officials began then taking steps for containment.These included the banning of all events involving more than 5,000 people in a confined space.In areas with a high number of cases all public gatherings - including markets and Sunday Mass - were banned and schools were closed.Stage 3 will probably be annonced soon.It is the epidemic phase where the virus is globaly active on the territory. I've read that it can last from 8 to 12 weeksOnce stage 3 begins there are extra measures that can be deployed if the government considers them necessary.They include : extra resources for health professionals and those working in law and order.Also possible restriction of public transport in some extreme cases.Provision to close schools, nurseries and community groups if necessary or impose movement restrictions and curfews.Stage 4 is usually called ""Return to normal"" so it's when the situation start to decrease."

im travelling on airtransat. Yes they dont have any travel advisory. Are you travelling? or changing your plan?
"@Chandrika - we have decided unless the government tells us we can't or they start closing things down, we are flying out on Sat as planned."
"I understand the government has banned gatherings of over 1000 people. Does this apply to museums, as I suspect the Louvre and perhaps the d'Orsay often have more than 1000 visitors at a time. What about Galleries Lafayette?"
@Dave - from what I am reading the Louvre is only allowing guest who have pre purchased timed tickets. Not sure if that is something you already have in hand for your trip. I also am not sure if it is something you can still get your hands on. Good luck
"thanks CP. The Louvre policy was in effect when we visited last October. It did not prevent a mob scene on the stairway and hallway leading to the Mona Lisa, but made entrance to the Louvre much faster."
I would like to know if the restrictions at the tourism spots are applied to the Paris Museum Pass... anybody knows?
@paulariciolli I saw on the Louvre website that even if you have a Paris Museum Pass you have to get a timed entrance. It will allow you to input the serial number from your pass so you don't have to pay more. I hope that helps.
"@MJS: thanks for sharing that US State Dept. link (https:/…), I was trying to find any France-related notices on the CDC site and hadn't found any.I have to continue to take a wait and see approach for now - as my trip isn't scheduled until late May and the airline I'm flying hasn't issued information for that time frame yet."

France and the Netherlands have a level 3 (avoid all but essential travel) warning from the CDC. The UK is level 2. Older adults and those with chronic medical problems should consider postponing nonessential travel.
"N4th, are you prepared to properly quarantine you and your family at home for 14 days when you return? I don’t think this will be resolved within the next few weeks, it’s just starting to hit its stride in the US.

I am expecting the president to announce confinement during his speech at 8pm tonight. There are still too many people out on the streets.
Long long long lines at the supermarket today.Macron speaking right now about confinement.
"I'm scheduled to fly from Marseille in morning to Paris, then to JFK. It's hard to understand what Macron has said? Will my flight to USA (I'm a citizen) be canceled tomorrow?"
"No. Nobody leaving the Schengen zone will be stopped from doing so. It will be much more difficult to enter, however."
"Macron anounced today that France ""is at war"" (against corona virus) and that on Tuesday 17.March20 lockdown will take place. People weren't serious and responsible about respecting the rules established recently. Now it starts to be tough! Borders will be closed except for crossborder commuters, lockdown will be controlled by public authorities like in Spain, Italy.... Stay healthy!"
Thank you. This makes sense.
"Starting tomorrow, anybody leaving their domicile or hotel for any reason should be in possession of a written declaration stating the reason they are outdoors. Apparently, the form may be dowloaded from government websites tomorrow. (Obviously, if you don't have a printer, you can write it by hand.) The fine if you are stopped without justification will range from 35 to 135 euros. I don't know if ""stupid tourist"" qualifies as a valid reason, but I suspect that it does, at least this week."
"As European countries come to grips, hopefully, with Covid-19, many are looking at whether or not they should relax any of their restrictions or, in fact, tighten them. In terms of London, as an example, the Government will do an assessment next Monday, and I doubt that any changes will be made.Would colleagues in Paris like to comment on the up-to-date situation, in the Capital and the rest of the country; and, if you wish to, perhaps give a guesstimate of when you feel that borders may open and things might return to some semblance of normality.Keep well allAnthony K"
"Macron apparently will do a performance on TV next Monday. I was hoping it was tonight as I thought planned but no.My dates of interest are April 11 and May 6th for now.The shopping supermarkets are full of people, same with the bakeries, tobacco shops and whatever else is deemed essential. It's one big block party until we check out then we go back to confinement.There is no more going out to exercise during the day between 10AM and 7PM in my area so the brigade jog and walk in uniform altogether at 7:01pm and catch up on the day's news. At 8:01pm we separate and return to our confinement waiting to join the supermarket shuffle the next day.If the politicians and journalists and jackboots could also respect the social distancing this circus of control would be more palatable.Happy Passover! Bread and lamb for a week.."

"So you want to save lives, prevent the virus spreading and insist on social distancing.Any reason you wouldn't ban something altogether. Or put in place levels of fines for breaking ""curfews,"" irresponsibly, that are really a deterrent.Anthony K"
"Tonight's speech by President Macron will take place at 20:02 so as not to conflict with the daily event at 20:00.There have been wild speculations by the media about what he will announce, but the only totally sure thing is another extension of the lockdown."
"Macron announced tonight that the lockdown will be postponed until May 11th. Then things will gradually start reopening. First schools and daycares might reopened... ( but then again they might revise it once there, we'll see ). All festivals until mid-July have been canceled. For now restaurants, cafés and hotels will remain closed until further notice. So are the borders with non-Europeans countries.https://www.europe1.fr/societe/en-direct-cor…https://www.thelocal.fr/20200413/macron-exte…Edited: 7:55 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"My scheduled flight to Paris is on Jun 5. Obviously things will not be anywhere close to normal by then so I wouldn't go even if I could. But the flight is through a small, budget airline and they won't refund me unless they are legally obligated -- i.e. if the flight is canceled. For those of you more informed of the situation in France, do you think it is almost certain that international flight restrictions will not be lifted by June 5?"
"At present priority for air travel is, quite correctly, being given to getting people home, who have been stranded abroad. That is still happening.Some countries are beginning to lift a few restrictions, on internal travel, and the re-opening of some work places.I haven't read of any relaxing of the restrictions in France or flights into and out of European airports.My own judgment is that very little change will happen during May and it could well be July before things return to some normality.Keep well allAnthony K"
"I have a weeks vacation, to Paris, booked and paid for, beginning on Monday September 7th and I am quietly optimistic that it will be possible.Keep well allAnthony K"
"Hi all, Ive been trying to find information regarding a 24h layover in paris. My girlfriend is trying to get home to sweden from greece, but theres not many flights at all, but we did find one coming weekend, but theres a 24h layover in paris. anyone know if it possible to leave the airport to stay in a hotel for the night, or are there too much restrictions so she would have to wait at the airport?Kind regards,Jonas"
BonjourWhat is the latest news from your Government and Health professionals regarding any easing of the lockdown restrictions?Any thoughts on whether buying tickets for September events might be a good or very bad idea?Thanks for your helpKeep well allAnthony K
"Last night, the Prime Minister indicated that the curve of the virus has effectively reached a plateau. Starting today, family visits to elderly people in residential facilities will be possible under limited circumstances. 11 May begins the gradual, progressive déconfinement. There will be a probable requirement of wearing masks in public. Schools will begin to reopen, but not all schools and not all at the same time. Télétravail will be maintained as much as possible. The reopening of shops will be staggered; from what I understand from the PM's briefing, the opening date of cafés and restaurants is not clear. Physical distancing policies will continue to be in effect. Personally, I think it would not be prudent to purchase tickets for events in September right now."
"Agree. I wouldn't want to be at an event, especially indoor, without social distance and before a reliable vaccine. Coming out of lockdown will have its own challenges."

"Hi friends, I am scheduled to be in Paris for my honeymoon June 21. I booked through expedia and they say it is to soon to change anything. Everything I’m reading says we SHOULD be able to travel, but that many things will still be closed? Our goal is to drink champagne at the top of the eiffel tower and see the Louvre. Everything else is optional. What sites are people seeing that have any information beyond “we are closed, check back later.” We haven’t bought tickets for eiffel or louvre yet because the sites won’t let us."
"Hi RevBT - I have a trip scheduled to Paris in October. I also have a domestic trip in July and had an Italy trip cancelled in March. My outlook has been this - no one can predict at this point whether your ""Must-sees"" will be open in June...or if those of us in the still getting hit hard US will be permitted to enter France in June. Even if things open tomorrow they could close back down at any moment if cases begin to jump. I've cried. I've obsessed about it. But, alas, nothing we can do! I am resigned at this point to the fact that 2020 travel MIGHT happen, but we can't be sure it will until we step off the plane at our destination. And we MIGHT be able to see some of the sights we hoped - but we can't be sure those will happen until we step into the location. This pandemic is a good reminder that nothing is guaranteed. Good luck to you - I hope you can take your honeymoon...but keep your 2020 travel expectations low."
"I would assume you will not be able to enter France in June and even if you do, you would need to quarantine for 2 weeks upon entering.Edited: 1:47 pm, April 29, 2020 "
Is that the case still? That won't work for us. We are only there a week.
"The government has announced once again that anyone entering France will be quarantined for 14 days (even French nationals), and anyone who tests positive will be quarantined for 30 days.However, no date has been set yet for opening the borders except for emergency travel."
"Thank you. Hopefully that changes and we can still go. My hopes are low as we (Pittsburgh, PA USA) just got extended through May 15."
"France as extended the state of health emergency until July 24. It has also been mentionned a few times that the borders outside of the Schengen area might not open before September.Unfortunately, you will need to rethink your honeymoon."
Ouch....thank you. I guess we will save this trip for next year or later.
"OK our, UK, PM has just said ...""I will not say that Quarantining for those arriving into Britain through Airports and all other Ports will definitely happen. When it MIGHT start and what the length of the Period of Isolation would have to be, and when re-consideration might happen. ""Anthony K"

"My flight and hotel were just cancelled by the companies. I have now changed the dates for 2021. Hopefully we can still go at that point. This was supposed to be our honeymoon. Instead it will be our one year anniversary trip. We are calling it our ""Corona-moon"""
"Sorry to hear, RevBT - but you are in good company. I think at this point I know more people who have had vacations cancelled this year than not! I hope your wedding can still go on as planned - even if it needs to be modified it can still be wonderful. My cousin just had a tiny little wedding with his immediate family and will have his big celebration next year."
"Planning is either a pastime or it's a nightmare. For me it is the former, for travel companies it appears to be the latter.Due to circumstances, an uncaring virus beyond my control, I now have 4 vacations booked, and I anticipate completing them all if I live that long. The first of these is to depart LHR to CDG on September 7th 2020. 7 nights in Paris. Keep well allAnthony K"
"Good luck, Anthony! I hope your trip can happen, because that give me a better chance my October one can ;-) Though I am wondering what wearing a mask the full way to Europe would be like, given economy isn't super comfy in best of conditions!"
"BeckyThank-you. I now have two masks, neither of which is NHS PPE approved. One is uncomfortable and the other one is even more uncomfortable.C'est la vieAnthony"
"In terms of this present moment in time, depending on the actions of Airlines, flights, to and from Paris, may be starting up sooner than expected. Check with your chosen Airline and read all the French ""Authority"" advice.Every decision you make must, firstly, be based on the wellbeing of you and yours.Keep well allAnthony K"
"Hey Anthony, booked our trip to France several months ago before the virus hit and hope we can go as currently scheduled from Oakland to CDG on September 15 for 4 nights in Paris on Rue Cler and then 4 nights in Nice. We’re really hoping the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, etc. are open otherwise it won’t be worth going and would postpone the trip. 3.5 months from now and so we’re hopeful that things get back to near normal (but probably reduced capacity, but on the bright side that should mean a lot less crowds). Been reading that they are talking about letting football games resume in France come September so that bodes well for us too."
"DannyWho knows. If Football teams are decimated by having a high number of virus sufferers, then you might get a game.Keep wellEnjoy your visitAnthony"
I also have been planning on travelling to france but because of this pandemic it is all down the drain.
"The UK is to bring in a 14 day quarantine period for all those coming into Britain, from the 8th of June ... to be reviewed after three weeks.There is to be no exceptions for travellers coming from EU countries.I feel that France and other EU countries will reciprocate.July and August may see changes to this measure.Anthony K"
"Hi Please may I get some advice or be pointed in the right direction. I booked my trip to Paris in February and paid for my Paris accommodation then. Since coronavirus, there is a travel ban in my country and I have had to cancel my trip. I have tried to contact the company who I booked an apartment with since April and have not had any response, I can not afford to loose 609 euros, please advise what I can do? Thanks"
I am booked for a trip to Paris October 2020. I want Paris to be the city I love and be able to stroll the city. Enjoy restaurants etc. I am looking for advise on going or rescheduling for next spring. Advise welcome
I am booked for September and am watching to see what happens.
We are booked the end of September to early October and have been monitoring the situation. Hopefully we are given the green light to visit then from the US.
"My personal feeling, if there is not a second wave of this scourge, is that Paris will be open and as welcoming as ever from some time in late July.I hope everyone who has future bookings will get and enjoy their visits.Keep well allAnthony K"
I just hope that after all the efforts French have made we don't go and ruin it for them. I am a bit biased on this having people I love there.
"I went on the website of the French consulate in San Francisco. They have a list of do's and don'ts, country by country. rights to go here, rights to go there, paperwork etc. Give it a go."
"littlelambsussex - definitely something to consider. All of us who may travel before this pandemic is over need to be respectful. Practice social distancing, wear masks, and if we're sick we need to make the choice to stay home. In addition to being extra cautious while on travel, I plan to step up the isolation the days leading up to trips and the days following trips to reduce the chances I unknowingly carry a virus to or from my travels. I do worry that there are many across the US no longer taking this seriously and that our numbers are starting to show it with increased cases. I wouldn't be surprise that even if countries do open their boarders they may make exceptions for countries who do not have this under control, and US has a good chance of being on that list."
Restaurants have fully reopened in Paris as of today.
And the requirement to have a permit from one's employer in order to ride on public transit during rush hours has been lifted as of today (Tuesday). Masks are still required on public transportation.
"That is hopeful, Euromanic! Though I am a little bit anxious about what all this re-opening will mean in the coming weeks and months...will countries/states need to pull back? Or will people be respectful enough to wear masks and physically distance to permit us some level of normalcy until a vaccine? Time will tell. I hope we can make travel a part of life again - even if it looks different for awhile."
"Covid-19 has very low mortality and morbidity, so I'm not worried. Things like masks and social distancing don't really accomplish anything, anyway. The economic effects are a disaster, and a much greater cause for concern."
"New research is coming out daily, so I understand your skepticism, but I don't quite agree. Studies have suggested masks are effective if enough of the population are wearing them - which makes sense to me since the way this spreads is by aerosol and limiting the distance our breaths, coughs, and sneezes and giving some distance seems like a logical way to reduce risks. So I will definitely continue to wear masks at indoor spots - at home and while on travel. As for the mortality - Yes, low risk for many of us. But I know of enough tragedies from this, as many of us do, to be a bit cautious. I agree we need to do something about the economy - and mask wearing and distancing can allow us to have a safer system for the economy to go on in a relatively normal fashion."
"I am 85 years old and it is not good for us old folks to get this virus. Therefore, I am all for masks, and really get ticked off when someone doesn't wear one. i so want to say something to someone who doesn't wear one, but don't want to get spit on, punched etc. But i am having big troubles wearing a mask. I have tried several brands, even my general doc giving me a sample of his kind, but it cuts my air off and the first week it went into affect I went to the market , felt funny, got home and the doc feels I had a mini stroke (T??) I was talking gibberish. So therefore, it cuts into any travel, stores allowed, if any, etc, and I dread going to the market which is the only place we have been outside of the house and then every two weeks or more, and doctor appts. etc."
"The disease is almost none present. Mask and social distancing purpose are only there to keep the pandemic alive until they have the vaccin ready and make full of money. They make people suffer so most of them will take it. Not bigger than the flu according to stats, like euromanic said. Thats why they all batched on hydroxychloroquine, saying it has second effect, but has been there for like 60 years without any problem."
"If it is all put on, why does the United States have about 26% of total cases world wide and about the same % for deaths all world wide? Not everyone is full of hooey!!. those numbers aren't even true from what I have heard because of certain countries lying etc."
A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced. Unless of course you happen to be the French President or a member of his entourage.One rule for the elite and another for the sheep.C'est la vie.Anthony K
"Distancing and masks don't make a difference after a minute or two. The virus can easily travel beyond the arbitrary limits set for distancing, and easily flows right around masks (the proof is when your glasses fog—because your breath s bypassing the mask and flowing out through openings between the mask and your face). So in closed rooms, elevators, subway cars, and so on, you're likely to be exposed with or without a mask or distance. Fortunately, many infected people never get sick, and mortality is about the same as the flu, so the uselessness of masks and distance don't matter."
"EU May Ban Travel from US as it Reopens: https:/…Nothing official yet, but some of us may need to wait a bit longer to visit France. Crossing my fingers things change by October!"
"At my ancient age something is better than nothing at this point in the game. I don't have too many years left and I want to use them, not have a virus destroy them If the masks help even a tiny bit , please wear them, Something is better than nothing at this point, especially for us old timers."
"Euromanic - I think for many of us a minute or two is all we need. I avoid indoor activities other than grocery shopping these days. I don't need to stand near a particular person for very long at all - seconds only, or longer at the checkout counter but in those cases we're both wearing masks and often there's a plastic guard up. The USA is full of mask-deniers and people who don't believe social distancing is necessary...and it's not working out for us!"
"I saw in paper today that the European Union was thinking of forbidding anyone from US entering the country, just as they have done with Russia and some other countries."
Any American's here that didn't leave Paris before Covid hit? Was curious how the new potential ban against US tourists could affect people that have already been in Europe for some time and don't have Covid.
"Re: #164—the travel restrictions obviously only affect new arrivals. Anyone already in France isn’t going to be kicked out, assuming their travel visa allows them to stay this long."
"#165 - I'm not referring to getting kicked out, which implies people are being tracked down somehow. LolI realize I should have been more clear. I was referring to traveling to other EU countries from France.Now that restrictions are changing EU to EU, wondered if any American's experience issues.Maybe no one has tried either way, as I said was curious.Thanks for replyingEdited: 10:24 pm, June 25, 2020 "

Do arrivals from the UK still have to isolate for 14 days on arrival?I was planning a birthday trip from 17th to 20th July.
"The quarantine is voluntary, only recommended not enforced as I understand it as long as you show no symptoms. Most likely in the next week or two it will no longer be even a small issue, as the new 'air bridges' to France from the UK should be reciprocated by France easing restrictions on UK travellers."

"Greetings from Canada; we are booked for Paris in September and were wondering if anyone could tell us if there are currently quarantine restrictons for arrivals from Canada?thanks in advance,Mac"
"Yes, there currently is a 14 day quarantine requirement for all arrivals, tho it can change before September. You also must arrive at one of the following airports: Calgary (YYC), Montreal (YUL), Toronto (YYZ), Vancouver (YVR).Up to date info can be found on this website: https:/…1580226297.htm"
"Just for clarification, the information that Annette has written is for people arriving in Canada, not France. Mac, there is not a 14-day quarantine period required for arrivals from Canada, although one can be applied at the health authority's discretion. Upon a return to Canada, travellers currently need to quarantine for 14 days. That could change in September.Edited: 12:37 pm, July 05, 2020 "
"Darn, I read that question wrong, my bad!"
"thank you all for your responses, however I am now a little confused; on the website of the French Embassy to Canada, the following information appears to be current...perhaps I am misreading the translation to English they posted, particularly the last line.

"France has decided to test all airline passengers of any nationality arriving from 16 countries:United Arab Emirates, United States, Bahraïn, Panama, South Africa, Kuwait, Qatar, Israel, Brazil, Peru, Serbia, Algeria, Turkey, Madagascar, India, Oman"
Just to add to K2's news: general tourism is still prohibited. Only citizens of France or permanent residents of France returning from the named 16 countries will be issued a Covid-19 test and allowed to enter the country. https://www.france24.com/fr/20200724-covid-19-jean-castex-recommande-aux-français-de-ne-pas-se-rendre-en-catalogne
"True. I should have pointed out that someone who manages to go to another country (for example, Americans who have been talking about being able to go to Turkey) are still not allowed unrestricted entry to France even if they pass the covid test. Normally, they would not even be allowed to board a flight from Istanbul to Paris or the airline would receive a huge fine.The current exemptions for unauthorized countries continue to be diplomats, medical professionals on a mission, and not much more than that."

Outdoor terrace privileges for cafés and restaurants have been extended to June 2021 but must close at 22:00.

"The government has changed its mind twice this morning. Joggers and cyclists don’t have to wear masks, at least at this very moment. Also, people smoking or eating are exempt. And the government recommends against kids being picked up at school by their grandparents. The lack of any objective basis for the orders apparently makes it difficult to keep them the same for more than a few hours."

"The authorities in Paris have been issuing an average of 700 fines a day (135 euros) for people not respecting the mask rules. These almost always are given to people who are outdoors with no mask at all in their possession, not to people who have removed their mask temporarily for some reason (eating, smoking...). It is at the discretion of the police, but I have seen them being very nice so far, usually just gesturing to people who have their mask below their nose or things like that. People in good faith do not receive fines. However, if you take off your mask, you should be standing still and not walking around (like eating a sandwich or something).."
thanks for your reply.. the most important is...!! the photos.. i dont want all of my photos with mask... sorry i am out of topic with the next question.. i will be in paris from 9 to 15 september and i will go versailles and disneylan..what is the best ticket for the metro lines??

"IDF Mobilités, the Paris metropolitain area transit authority, has removed seating restrictions from all public transportation, and the ""don't sit here"" stickers are being removed from all of the previously forbidden seats. This is very simply because ridership is returning to normal with the end of the summer holidays and it is stupid to make people stand up in a crowd when they could be sitting down.To be honest, we Parisians learned to make our own rules about this already a month ago when it because clear that logic had not always been used in forbidding certain seats in the metro and in buses. And in any case, it was never mandatory to avoid those seats, just a suggestion."
