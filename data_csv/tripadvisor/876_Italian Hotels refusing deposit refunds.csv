"How widespread is the problem of Italian hotels refusing to honor their cancellation policies with respect to reservation deposits? I booked a 4 star hotel in Sorrento to visit in May, which is now refusing to refund my deposit, even though I cancelled well before the full-refund cancellation period specified in my booking. They are offering instead a voucher good for a year and citing some apparent Italian legislation that supposedly permits them to do this. I can't believe that the Italian legislature would permit Italian hotels to abridge their contractual obligations, nor can I believe that first rate hotels would do this to their customers. We all realize that the corona virus is causing significant hardship in the hospitality industry, but to void contractual cancellation provisions and shift the risk to customers is not the answer. For one, no one should book any Italian hotel that requires a deposit to hold the reservation."
"It's true. Comma 88 of the Decree n. 18 of 17 March.Given the impossibility for hotels to honour their obligations because of government decision, they can offer vouchers instead of reimbursement."
"No one here has a clue how wide spread any behavior is right now; this is a travel forum and a gazillion people don't even know about Tripadvisor.If you have written confirmation from when you booked as to your cancelation terms and conditions and used a credit card to book, you might want to discuss a charge-back with your bank/credit card company if the hotel is violating its own terms and conditions."
Thanks. I will do that.
"I don’t see it as a problem. These hotels are going to suffer tremendously-and that translates into suffering for everyone they employ. Being able to keep non-refundable payments allows them to weather this storm slightly better. If all hotels, but also theaters etc refunded all tickets and downpayments, by the time this crisis is finished, there won’t be any hotels and theaters left. Is that what you want?The pain has to be shared. It’s not the hotel’s fault. They are just as powerless as you. In the bigger scheme of things, it’s much better if none of these prepaid amounts were refunded, and each individual customer shares some pain. I was speaking to a friend in a different European country yesterday, and he works in the theater industry. He explained that the industry, in cooperation with the government and the judiciary, is looking at solutions to do just that (I.e no refunds) in order to give the theaters a chance to survive. It sounds like Italy already has some of the regulations in place. Good for them."
"You and I disagree. Although we are both sympathetic to the plight of the hotel industry, they should honor the cancellation provisions of their deposit requirements, and not change them unilaterally. If Italy wishes to provide relief to the hotel industry, it can do so in the form of loans and other government provisions, not by shifting the risk to customers in violation of the contractual provisions that those customers relied upon. What if, in different circumstances, the hotel industry was viewed as a villian and was ordered to pay twice the deposit received? That would be unfair and illegitimate too. You and I simply disagree on the sanctity of contracts (impossibility of performance is a recognized exception, but that does not apply here). Incidentally, had they asked me to volunteer to convert my right to receive my deposit refund into a voucher for a longer period, I would have been inclined to accept it, but as a matter of volunteering to help on my part, rather than a unilateral reneging on their part."
"I would take the coupon voucher at this time and rebook dates, I don't see any tourism from abroad into Italy after the new year to many virus cases to date in Italy."
"Not sure what poster #4 is talking about - The OP stated ""I booked a 4 star hotel in Sorrento to visit in May, which is now refusing to refund my deposit, even though I cancelled well before the full-refund cancellation period specified in my booking."" which indicates that it was not a ""non-refundable"" booking rather, it is one that could be canceled. If OP's statement is correct, then pursuing return of the refund is fair. If OP was trying to get a refund for a pre-paid, non-refundable booking then, I would support the hotel holding firm on those terms as booking non-refundable bookings is always a bit risky and usually less pricey than a booking that allows cancelation.  It is the risk one takes when choosing such pre-paid, non-refundable bookings - something I never do because life it far too unpredictable for me to risk my hard earned money that way but it is a personal choice."
"Your assumption is correct: it was a refundable deposit, not a non-refundable prepaid reservation. If the later, I would have borne the risk of cancellation and would have no complaint.I have read some reviews of the Italian Decree that the hotel is relying on (which Pier Id in comment 1 cited), and it appears to excuse impossible performance, which is not the case here. There may be a specific provision in the Decree allowing for vouchers in lieu of refunds, but such a provision has not been identified in the various summaries of the Decree."
"If you are within the allowed time frame by your bank/credit card company to initiate a charge-back, why not call them and discuss it with themI don't know the decree to which you are referring so can't comment on that, Maybe it does as poster #1 says - is there a link to it that can be shared here? I'm sure it will be of interest to others in the same boat right now."
"Hello Marc, it is not so simple, I try to explain. The text of the article 88 of the new decree says:""Le disposizioni di cui all'articolo 28 del decreto-legge 2 marzo2020, n. 9 si applicano anche ai contratti di soggiorno""It means that the art. 28 of the old decree of 2 march (which was referred to contracts of transport) becomes applicable to hotels too. I think it is quite clear the lockdown is the mentioned ""impossibility"" which allows to reimburse by voucher, as the decree was made for that. The applicable law for italian hotels is the italian law, and obviously this is a higher level of law which overrule the terms and conditions, for italians as well. There is not much to do, for us too, I think.Edited: 5:19 pm, March 28, 2020 "

If you paid by credit card then try for a charge back.

"We have taken some losses on travel. Had we travelled, we would have spent a lot more money.We are at home, as isolated as possible and safe. As evidenced by this note, I am alive. That's the current best option. Complicated, limiting. Important because if more than 20% choose to wander, disease limitation fails. These are Australian calculations about 20%.

Pier at the moment there is no lock down for May. What you posted doesn't apply. Even if they extend it the rumoured two weeks it still wouldn't apply to MayOP did you book direct? You're always at the mercy of the hotel in that case. Hopefully you paid by credit card. They are the ones to contact.
"Hello ntenzena,Art. 1 of the decree 28 defines the subjects who can cancel reservations:""Soggetti che hanno programmato soggiorni o viaggi con partenza o arrivo nelle aree interessate dal contagio""The following art. 5 says the reasons for which they can cancel:"" I soggetti di cui al comma 1 possono esercitare il diritto di recesso dai contratti di pacchetto turistico da eseguirsi:1 nei periodi di ricovero, 2 di quarantena con sorveglianza attiva, 3 di permanenza domiciliare fiduciaria con sorveglianza attiva,ovvero 4 di durata dell'emergenza epidemiologica da COVID-19 nelle aree interessate dal contagio""So customers can cancel freely (point 4) during the period of ""state of epidemiological emergency"".I think this bit is what gives to hotels legal reason to intend any cancellations as referring to the state of epidemic emergency. Which has been declared until the 31 of July.Edited: 5:05 am, March 29, 2020 "
Maybe Marc (or anyone of us in the same situation) could try explain the cancellation is not due to the state of emergency but to other personal problems. I don't think it will work but who knows.
Thank you for your instructions on this.
"I agree with you Bamboo. I have put down a deposit of 96 euros to a hotel in Cefalu in April. I have been told that they will not refund but will allow me to change my reservation to a later date within the year. I am fine with those terms. I would like to reschedule my trip but if I can not get back within a year, I am fine with the hotel keeping my deposit. I feel the same as you, at least it will help ease the loss of revenue that the hotel industry in Italy is experiencing at the moment. I would hate to see a total devastation of hotels in Italy knowing that one day I will be coming back. When I do return to Italy I would like for the hotels, museums, restaurants, etc to all be thriving. If I lose my hotel deposit then so be it. At least I will know that I have given a small amount into helping with the recovery effort. Praying for Italy."
"As I am sheltered in place as a matter of civic duty and have way too much time on my hands, let me take issue with the economic premise of those who support permitting Italian hotels to alter their deposit cancellation policies in light of the devastation caused by the pandemic. All of us are sympathetic to the plight of the hospitality industry, but the only thing we do know is this decree (assuming it does permit the abrogation of cancellation policies) provides an economic benefit to hotel owners at the expense of reservation guests. There is absolutely no guarantee that this economic benefit will be shared with hotel employees, versus kept by the owners of the hotel; it depends on the owner(s) largess, which he/she/they could have done in any event. Two things that we can surmise: first, the redistribution effects here are probably perverse, in that the owner(s) of a luxury hotel in Italy are probably better off (wealth; income) than their average guest. Second, the hotels will survive this crisis no matter what. They just might surface with different owners, which should be a risk that existing owners had to wear, and not their customers through conversion of their deposits."
I paid 100% deposit for Milan hotel. Hotel sent me a copy (in pidgeon English) of a Minsters document which said if customer cancelled due to Coronavirus then a refund was not required only a credit voucher for 1 year from date of issue. However it did not appear to mention if it was the hotel that was closed therefore was not open to the customers. I am currently working through a dispute process with the credit card company which i used for payment
Tony @22 please report back...come June I will probably have to be doing the same.
If the hotel can show flights were cancelled first you won't have a case. Unless the hotel cancelled your reservation first they will be covered by the new ruling.Donna

Greece has enacted a similar “law” of which we were notified today. We booked a fully refundable Santorini Caldera cruise and paid €1250. I requested cancellation and was sent a very long form letter email stating the new Greek law which allows them to not honor their contract for refunds and only provide credit vouchers good for 18 months. Of course if you don’t use the voucher within 18 months it says they then have to refund you. That is assuming that this business is actually still in business because by then our credit card company charge would be a long beyond the Contesting time allowance.
"I am experiencing the same problem with a hotel in Florence and another in Milan. La Scala also is using this new law to refuse a refund. I am disputing my full payments with my credit card companies. I and they are not Italian citizens. I would think that if they receive many disputes they might try to get Italian lawmakers to make exceptions for foreigners and not have this new law grandfather in reservations made prior to its enactment.Edited: 5:43 pm, May 01, 2020 "
"if you look at the website federalberghi.it you will see that italian law enables hotels to offer vouchers. However, I am unable to access the whole article as it is only accessible to those registered in the industr y. The beginning of the article states coronavirus - voucher policy - changeshttps://www.federalberghi.it/circolari/coron…- service: Legal & Tax- circular no. 189 of 2020When converting the “Cura Italia” decree into law, Parliament, at the request of the Federation, modified the provision that allows accommodation facilities to issue a voucher as an alternative to reimbursement, in the event of cancellations due to the Covid emergency. 19. It is clarified that the provisions are also applicable in cases where the stay has been purchased or booked through a travel agency or a booking portal, also in derogation of the ...I am desperately trying to get back a full refund from the Albergo Mazzanti in Verona who are no longer even responding to my emails. Any sympathy I once had for the industry is fading fast if they can be so rude. Can anyone retrieve the full article because I still don't know if refunds are possible."
"Reasonable argument. However, had the hotels offered some small compensation (5-10% off?) as a good-faith gesture, it would have gone a very long way in placating people's feelings of being ripped-off. They didn't do that as far as I know, and THAT is why I and other travelers are incensed by these cavalier gov't decrees and the inflexibility of hotels to reach a fair compromise for abridging their written responsibilities. In short, it's a load of horse crap."
"So here is my question. I booked a non-refundable hotel. I took that risk. If I cancelled for any reason, I would have to eat that money. I understand this. However, I received an email from my hotel that said that THEY had to cancel my reservation. If they are breaking the contract how am I not entitled to my money back? There has to be a caveat there or else every hotel could take everyone's money and consistently cancel. Obviously I do not think they would but there should be some consumer protection too."
I emailed three times asking the hotel to confirm they were actually closed at the time of my booking. But no confirmation guess this was so they could not be seen to be the side which broke contract. And then three days after our non existent visit they emailed to say thank you for visiting and hope to see you again soon ( sic)
WheresTheBeach_26 This is my thinking too. I also thought it could become that all non-refundables could end up having dates changed and a voucher issued by the accommodation without this being suitable to the purchaser. I get that these places are doing it economically hard but so too are many of us that purchased those accommodations.
"Melanie H. The only positive that I have is that my CC company took a copy of the cancellation email and used it as a basis to dispute charges and will be processing a charge back to the hotel. It is a shame because if/when I am ever able to go back, I will not only not book with them, I will be very skeptical of any other establishment I choose. It does not seem that there is equity in protection. These are horrible times and I do feel for independent businesses but I am afraid that this methodology will sour visitors confidence in travelling once they are allowed."
"WheresTheBeach_26:However, to classify this as an ""Italian hotels"" issue as the title of this thread suggests is ridiculous. There are numerous complaints from people who made reservations for US hotels in the same exact situation."
It is indeed a problem worldwide but what makes the situation in Italy and France and maybe other EU countries is the government stepped in and gave the owners an option to not refund even refundable hotels. If my situation were in US or many other countries my refundable booking whereby I cancelled within the terms and conditions would certainly be refunded. In US those with problems are only non refundable bookings and the buyer assumed a risk...one that some avoid by booking higher priced refundable rooms. I agree @37...regarding the feeling this leaves given many are getting full refund.
"I completely agree.Edited: 9:14 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"I suggest everyone who has been refused a refund to share their opinion online via reviews, public forms, and social media. While companies are not required by Italian Law to give you your money back they should have genuine concern and care for the guests who want to stay there. They should go out of their way to offer something so enticing that you would simply choose the voucher over the refund. For example a regular booking could be offered as an 'indefinite time voucher' with a free upgrade when you stay. Thus your single simple room you had in May is now bookable 2 years from now as a suite. They could make the vouchers transferable to others and thus your local tourist agency could take your 'unwanted' voucher and buy it from you and sell it for a better rate to someone who actually wants to make the booking in the future. Both the company and the consumer would be satisfied. Doing so also allows for a greater time period to even out the bookings rather than trying to force what looks to be months of bookings into a tight 1 year window. Companies will also fare well when a good percentage of people who do nothing (which is quite common) just eat the voucher and never return. The main point is this is not a zero sum game where the businesses are going to fall apart and must keep their customers money. There are a lot of options on the table and better businesses and companies will appease guests rather than rake them and hide behind Italian Law. Nowhere in Italian Law have I read that a company can't offer their consumer a better offer than a 1 year limited voucher. They are more than able to be creative and work for solutions that make their one time clients repeat visitors and tons of gushing reviews and praise rather than rebuke."
@41 could not agree more.
"I believe it is the whole of Italy. We have fully paid for our hotels in Italy and the hotels won’t give a refund or even a credit note.our flights out of our country was cancelled by the airlines and Italy does not allow tourist until June 3. There is no way we can be at the hotel and all we are asking is for the hotel to either refund or let us have the bookings extended till the same dates next year. This is very unethical of the hotels in Italy. If we ever travel again, we won’t go to Italy since they seem to be unscrupulous."
"We have the same problem trying to get a refund or a voucher from the hotels. Our flights were cancelled and I believe Italy is not going to open until June 3. We can’t be there and all we are asking is for a refund or a voucher. The hotels are refusing to negotiate and it is very unethical. Maybe the hotels have no interest in how it is perceived and tourist dollars don’t matter as they would resort to unscrupulous means to recover loss revenue. The Italian government should take action, especially the tourism ministry. If nothing is done, I would advise people to never book italian hotels in advance."
"anastasiomarcelo:This has absolutely **nothing** to do with Italy. People have had the same issue with hotels throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia - in other words - all over the **world**. For your particular situation - did you book a refundable or non-refundable rate? Did you make the reservation directly with the hotel or through a third party website? Many third party websites have been offering some sort of relief on non-refundable rooms - although the compensation varies greatly from website to website and will also depend on your original travel dates."
It would have been much clearer if these government ordinances were more specific as to the type of reservations booked. For example it seems unclear and totally up to the hotel if the reservations was non refundable...ok I get it ...no refund is no refund but a global pandemic with a country closed as well as hotel is not exactly expected and no refund usually means the hotel is there for you and it is YOUR problem you are not coming...that simply is not the case here. Government would have been well served to require hotels to offer the vouchers for future travel...smart customer service move and smart for getting travel moving again once it can safely happen. Losers all around on not working with future guests.
I have the same problem and the hotel is quoting Art. 88 Law Decree n. 18 dated 17 March 2020On researching this law i found this - consumers not able to attend an event can ask traders for a refund or get a voucher of the same value than the first ticket bought whose validity is a year from the date of its issuing. I don't believe this gives them the right to refuse a refund. Does anyone know the legal position
"Joon:It would help if you would provide more information. How did you make the reservation? With the hotel directly or through a third party website? Did you make a refundable or non-refundable reservation?When was your planned travel date?When did you reserve the hotel room?Edited: 12:06 pm, June 03, 2020 "
I made a free cancellation booking directly with the hotel in September 2019.I was planning to stay from June 1-4
"Joon:It is usually recommended to book direct with the hotel. However, in the case of COVID-19 refunds, it seems that it may have been better to book through a third party website. Some third party websites had extremely easy processes to receive a full refund, even on non-refundable rooms. Other booking websites were not as generous - the COVID-19 refund policy could vary greatly from website to website. I think your stay date of early June could be contributing to your issues as well. The hotel may want to refund you - but they simply do not have the funds to do so after a couple of months of little to no income."
Thanks for this. I sympathise with the problems that many businesses are facing but surely there are fairer alternativesMy problem with the voucher is that I will be unable to use it in the next 12 months. Effectively they are keeping my payment but I receive no service. Surely this is fundamentally wrong.
"Joon:>>My problem with the voucher is that I will be unable to use it in the next 12 months.<<It is a tough situation for all. Obviously, you did not intend to cancel the trip. I would add that the hotel didn't cancel your trip either. It was the government that closed the border to travel and also mandated that most businesses be shuttered. There are some conversations at the government level about revising this law - see post #5 of the below thread. There could be several ways of addressing this such as making an automatic refund if the voucher is not redeemed within the 12 months or perhaps the government could provide subsidies to the hotels to cover their mortgage payments. If you don't want to wait for a revised law, I would check to see if the voucher could be transferred and perhaps sell the voucher to someone else. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18779…"
"I completely sympathize with anyone having to deal with a hotel in Italy. I'm dealing with Hotel 55 fifty-five in Rome and it has been a terrible, terrible process. DON'T BOOK HERE. There are a lot of irrelevant issues being raised in the responses, particularly as to Italy.I booked through an OTA. You can all keep your comments on this to yourself, as Hotel 55 availed itself of the platform to reach a larger worldwide audience to boost its business, so it is completely fair for people to book through that OT. They should not be jerked around just because they do. In any event, in this time of coronavirus, it is utterly immaterial if you booked through an OTA as all the OTAs are claiming to be middle men and referring to the hotel's own policy. No OTA has a policy of its own to refund, despite press releases and website statements to the contrary. They only refund or give voucher if the hotel agrees to it. There is only a cancel for free button if the hotel allowed it. So, you are basically dealing with the hotel (or the OTA is dealing with the hotel on your behalf). In any event, Italy decree has clarified that it doesn't matter if you booked direct or booked through OTA.Hotel 55 -- like many others in Italy -- is non-responsive for weeks on end, then refuses to refund money. Regardless of whether the room was refundable, non-refundable or pay later, it doesn't matter in this situation. People on this site who claim the hotel can keep a 'non-refundable' rate in these circumstances are misinformed. General principles of contract law would require them to reimburse travelers when there is impossibility of performance -- like here where borders are closed to non-EU travelers until at least June 15 (and likely longer). Non-EU travelers are legally prohibited by Italian decree from entering the country, and hotels legally cannot provide a room for non-approved purposes like tourists outside the EU. Under general contract law, they owe a refund. Italy decree recognizes this, but then Italy made it very unfriendly to consumers (and circumvented contact law) by allowing refunds OR vouchers. At the very least, you get a one-year voucher for the full amount paid. There is commentary online one the legality of this decree that permits vouchers, despite consumers' requests for refunds. For those being refused refund or at least a voucher, here's the current version of the decree you need: It is Law No. 27 (Apr. 24, 2020) at Art. 88-bis. Text available at https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2020-04-24;27!vig= and tyou can use Google translate. Paragraphs 1, 3, 6, 9 and 10 should help you.I completely agree that the voucher is not helpful. There is no date set yet for when non-EU travellers can return to Italy (or other countries in Europe they'd have to fly through). Most commentary indicates it won't happen as of June 15. It is also not recognizing that people will have problems with vacation time, finding flights with severely reduced trans-oceanic flight schedules, continuously changing requirements for entry & quarantine, etc. I'm still trying to get the hotel to see that."
"@anastasiomarcelo -- At the very least, you must be given a voucher (which is completely not fair, but I'd take a voucher and then keep fighting with the hotel). See my post (#53). Here's the link to Law No. 27. You need Art. 88-bis. Text available (in Italian) at https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2020-04-24;27!vig="

Maybe the OTA that you chose decided to use this tactic, but this was not some sort of standard response. In fact, some OTA's made it super easy to submit a refund claim - they proactively emailed the consumer, asked if they wanted to keep the reservation and if not, created a 1 or 2 button click COVID-19 refund. Super, super easy.However, not all OTA's responded in the same manner and some chose to stonewall their customers. It appears that the OTA that you chose was one of the latter ones.I certainly have taken notice of each OTA's response and will adjust future booking reservations.>>non-responsive for weeks on end<<If the hotel was forced to shutter by the government, that could easily explain the ""non-responsiveness"" of the hotel.>>Under general contract law, they owe a refund. <<Not necessarily. As written, this comment is way oversimplied and incorrect."
"Wow, Drew. I don’t know why you are harassing people, but it’s actually you with the incorrect statements. Asking people who have had problems with hotels (as you doin this string) about how they booked (OTA or Direct) and rate (refundable or not) is completely immaterial in this instance. Read the Italy decree."
"Yeah, Drew. Their press release and website may say that. But read the actual policies in place right now, or talk to them, or read their investor filings. You’ll see it isn’t so simple. They are applying hotel policy, not their own. If there is an option to cancel for full refund for a particular reservation, it’s because the hotel agreed. People like you are why there is so much bad info out there. Why do you think there are so many complaints about Booking, Expedia, Hotels and others, specifically with Italy hotels?"
"101-Places-2-Go:>>completely immaterial in this instance<<No, it is not. More false statements by you. If someone mentions the OTA that they used and if I know that the OTA was offering generous COVID-19 refund terms, I point them in the direction to receive the refund.>> People like you are why there is so much bad info out there. <<And yet your posts are filled with incorrect information."
"Oh look. More off base comments from Drew. If you read the actual decree and not just spout your nonsense, you’ll see that how you booked is immaterial because the Italy decree says the refund/voucher applies whether you booked direct from hotel or through OTA, and you can’t travel to Italy because of travel restrictions. I was originally responding to two users — not you, Drew — who said their hotels wouldn’t give them a refund or voucher. By Italy decree (not OTA policy), they are entitled and should push hotels to comply if they are banned from going to Italy at the time their booking was to have happened. You were the one who harassed them with junk questions about how they booked and type of rate. I’m attempting to help them, while you just plied them with irrelevant questions."
101-Places-2-Go:It seems you are not even reading the responses. Good luck with resolving your situation with the hotel
"same thing has happened to me with a hotel in Salerno, and the deposit was over 1000 euros and it was meant to be refundable as per their terms and conditions when i booked, as long as i cancelled it more than 30 days before arrival, Now they will only give me a voucher but my plans for next yr have changed, i am trying a charge back with my credit card provider."
@61 same situation here...please report back on the charge back. Thanks.
"Some advice would be appreciated on my situation:- I booked a conference in Milan in mid July. I also booked a hotel through the conference website.- The terms and conditions for the hotel at the time of booking state that if I cancel before Apr 9th then I an entitled to a full refund minus 20 Euro admin fee.- The conference was cancelled. They refunded my conference fee immediately but said the hotel must be cancelled separately through their handler. I notified the hotel of cancellation on Mar 29th - well before the refund date.- They didn't reply, didn't reply to my 2nd email either. Finally this morning (2 and a half months later!) they have sent me a 1-year voucher quoting the usual statutes as mentioned in this thread. A voucher is useless to me since the conference is cancelled, I can't go on another date.- It is well beyond the credit card chargeback time limit so that is not an option.- Since Italy's hotels are now reopening I presume this hotel will be opened by mid-July, and they should be able to re-book my room and recoup any losses they would have had. Especially since I cancelled the booking well within the terms and conditions allowed; it wasn't cancelled by them due to coronavirus or inability to deliver their obligations.Edited: 4:03 am, June 10, 2020 "
"I've just checked the hotel website, they are currently taking new bookings for the dates I have booked. Does this mean the ""impossibility of hotels to honour their obligations"" doesn't apply to me, and presumably clauses 18 and 88 don't apply either, meaning they must stick to the original terms and conditions of the booking?"
"chesebrgr>>I've just checked the hotel website, they are currently taking new bookings for the dates I have booked. Does this mean the ""impossibility of hotels to honour their obligations"" doesn't apply to me<<Just because the hotel is accepting new reservations does not mean they have a fully booked hotel. I doubt that they have more than a few scattered reservations. The issue is cash flow. The hotel had no incoming cash flow for several months. Even if they wanted to refund you for your particular situation, they probably don't have the funds to do so. There is some talk about modifying the law. One potential outcome is to provide a cash refund at the end of the voucher period if the voucher is not used. However, nothing has been finalized yet."
@64..I would have really expected that the conference booking agent would have arranged for all attendees to get a refund. I would go back to them and speak to someone in authority. Agencies that handle this type of business rely on this conference business and need to help people out under the circumstances. Referring you to the hotel seems far less than professional.
"Thanks for both your replies.I don't mind waiting for a refund if the hotel's cash flow is a problem. Although I've already waited 2 and a half months from when I cancelled, I don't mind waiting a few more. If only they would tell me that cash flow is a problem and I will get my refund in due course or even at the end of the year, I would be happy. But their voucher makes it 100% clear that no cash will be refunded. I don't believe a modification of the law is necessary in my case, because surely these clauses 18 and 88 only apply when a hotel is unable to fulfil their obligations, ie. closed down by the government? That isn't the case here (they are taking bookings), so surely the normal laws apply, which mean their normal booking terms and cancellation policy should stand?I will definitely get onto the conference organiser if the hotel refuse to cooperate. I've emailed the hotel 3 days ago and haven't had a response yet. I'm sure there are many more people in the same position."
I logged a charge back case with my credit card company (Visa) over three months ago. Phoned to check progress and informed my case had not even been allocated to a agent yet. Has anyone had any success with credit card charge back with Italy hotels. Does the Italian coronvirus law hold water and it is ok to refuse cash refunds?
"Tony H:There have been mixed results. Some people have been successful with a charge back. Others had the charge back initially approved, but then weeks later - it was reversed and the charges were re-instated. Some people have been told that since a voucher was offered - that the charge back would be rejected. There was some discussion about the voucher law being modified to convert the voucher to a cash refund if the voucher goes unused within the stated time frame (I don't think this has been finalized yet). Part of the reason why Italy and other countries created this type of law (again - there are similar laws in other countries, not just Italy) was due to cash flow - most businesses will not have the funds to refund 6+ months of revenue.....once the bank balance goes to zero - how exactly are they supposed to pay out refunds??"
@68 not Italy but France and same deal really...did charge back with Visa as a last measure when I saw hotel was open and my dates were fully booked already (prime time in Provence) and hotel still said to wait. It was fast and hotel refunded right after Visa contacted them. What you are describing is some really poor service from your card and I would ask to speak to a supervisor...they have to file those in a timely manner.
The problem is they are not even providing vouchers and there is no one policing them.
"ROBERT B:What were your original planned travel dates? When did you make the reservation - before or after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak?Was the reservation a refundable rate or a non-refundable rate?Edited: 6:52 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"I had booked a hotel ( Il Sereno Lago di Como ) on 28/12/19 through Booking.com and the hotel took a 50% deposit which was according to the terms and conditions was refundable if cancelled before 8/8 at 11pm .Like you all , the hotel is quoting the Italian law and refusing to refund , just offering a voucher. They say they will give a cash refund after a year BUT my credit card runs out in December . I have emailed the hotel and Booking.com and have got nowhere.I had booked previous trips to France , lost some cash due to non refundable booking terms and I accepted that. However the goalposts have been moved here. My next option is the credit card provider. Has anyone been successful with this ?"
"Lady M:There have been mixed results. Some people have been successful with a charge back.

Thanks.I have just been on Tripadvisor looking at the hotel I booked and Booking.com still has free cancellation .OUTRAGEOUS!
I have some GOOD NEWS . Phoned Booking.com again and I am to be refunded the money today . Will update.
Yes the credit card charge back worked for me ...but as @74 no all have had good results.
"Thanks , gene .I have now been credited the money by Booking.com and I have moved it from the ""wallet"" to my credit card. The email said it will take 7 to 10 days to appear .I have had a good result."
"i refuted the charges that my hotel in rome charged my avis cc. and refused to cancell . Avis quickly addressed the problem in my favor. so, i decided to rebook the same place for 2021, hoping for a vaccine and italy opening up to Americans again"
"@79 however in my case given I had to go to the cc dispute option to get any kind of refund I won't be booking there again!! Had they been agreeable to a refund after almost two months of requests I probably would book again in the future. All about customer service and those hotels that worked with guests insured future customer loyalty which in the long run is the smart move.Edited: 10:18 am, August 03, 2020 "
