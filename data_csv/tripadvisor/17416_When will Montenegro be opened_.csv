"HI there,wondering if anyone knows when Montenegro will be opened for tourism? I have tried to find information on Google but can't find anything worthy.Thanks!"
"Hi,Montenegro has no more patients with corona. The Institute of Public Health announces the end of the epidemic on June 1. But when all measures will be suspended is not yet certain."
Read MN restrictions - one of most funny. What government of MN smoke?:-)
"It does look now that the borders may start opening up beginning of June. At present, we are first corona free country in Europe and if it continues like that hopefully by June 2 we will declare the end of epidemic."
When do you think tourists from the UK will be allowed to visit please? Thanks
Bump
And belgians! Travelling via Dubrovnik mid-july
Are there exceptions for transiting (like Slovenia for example where you are allowed to travel through as long as it is same day)? I am looking to go from Croatia to Albania direct in one day.
"We're due to arrive 27th August... But have no idea if we're allowed in or not, from the uk"
Andy have you found out if you can go yet ?
"We've moved it to next August, don't think it'll be the same experience this year with restrictions in place bars, restaurants ect"
"According to the Institute of Public Health of Montenegro, citizens of the United Kingdom are allowed entry to Montenegro when showing a negative result from a Covid-19 test.Source: https://www.ijzcg.me/me/novosti/covid-19-popâ€¦"
"Is it possible to enter Montenegro for the beach season like July to September from Croatia/Albania borders? I'm thinking of Dubrovnik to Budva visit and heading to Greece later. It used to be easy to go down along the coast lines and nowadays, so much health issues around at the customs."
