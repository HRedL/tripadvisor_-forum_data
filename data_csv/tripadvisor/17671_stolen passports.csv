returned on friday from a week in puerto ricco love the place but was very disappointed that we had our passports stolen before even collecting our luggage ...had to go to embassy to get emergency passports to be told its becoming a regular thing at las palmas airport so bit of advice keep hidden at all times and also take photocopys of your passport and holiday docs and put in case as need them to get emergency one we was just lucky we stay at same hotel so they could give us the deatils also in puerto ricco you cant report anything to the police without a translator again we was very lucky as hotel manager step in and took us there and translated for us...did spoil our holiday but wont stop me coming back ..keep your eyes peeled folks im over cautious and they managed it with me
"We go to PR every year as we own at the Holiday Club former Puerto Calma, never had a problem up to yet. Son recently got his pinched at Belgiums airport on his way back to the UK but got back on his driving licence luckily, they left the money tho. Thanks for the warning."
Hi Maxine. Were they stolen from your hand luggage between you presumably clearing passport control and reaching the luggage hall?
"I'm confused. Did you get back to UK , or did this happen in Las Palmas?"
I would be devastated rather than disappointed! Glad you had a good holiday all the same. We always scan a copy of our passports and send it to our e mail.Maybe you would be kind enough to let us know what actually happened so that others can be more cautious ;o)Edited: 5 years ago 
"Oh dear! Not good when something like that happens.Tbh, I treat our passports the way I treat our travel money! It stays in my zipped pocket until I put it in the room safe on arrival.The only time they leave my person is when I hand them to border control etc.Did you only have passports stolen ? Or money too?"
hi i travel 5 times a year min and have never experienced this..they was stolen between landing at las palmas and getting to passport control ..as time we reached there we had no passports lucky money was in different place to passports ..you was lucky to get home on a driving licence must depend where you are in the world as my partner had his with him and not a chance could he use it ...they seem to think its people actually getting on the flight with you that are doing it then flying off to somewhere else ...so watch all hand luggage and i know its sounds horrible but if somebody is a bit long in over head cabin where u keep ya hand luggage double check ...i actually had ours in bag under seat and still went was very upsetting
If they were stolen between departing the aircraft and reaching passport control it had to be a fellow passenger. How do you know they were stolen rather than dropped and not found ?
"Hi Maxine sorry to hear about your passport Drama, were you flying with Ryanair by any chance? ive heard the term daylight robbery and Ryanair mentioned in the same sentence many times! Lol."
i know i never dropped them cos they was in the bag just as we was landing as sorted documents out for transfer etc and if they was dropped they would of been found as police sent a search out of the plane etc ..haha yes was ryanair
So someone possibly 'dipped' into your bag while you were getting off the plane? Oh that gives me the creeps. Thank you for the warning Maxine
"You would have to be unlucky fussy57 to encounter the same 'thief' ! I mean, what do they do? Fly back and forth 4 times a day just to steal passports?;)There are a few ways in which Maxine's passports disappeared, either stolen, misplaced, dropped, or indeed picked from her handbag. We were in p.r in February and April and we are going back at the end of May, and when at the airport, we didn't have anyone within 3 feet of us! So maybe Maxine had the misfortune to travel with a horrible person, who seized on the opportunity to steal her passports?Nevertheless, I shall be on the lookout when we are there in 3 weeks time."
"Hi Liverpool Ollie,We aren't flying with Ryanair so not so bad but it's still creepy all the same! We will be there in 5 weeks time so by then you will have scared him/her off LOL.Maybe this is a good time to remind people to be more careful with their passports, tickets, money etc. We recently bought a new suitcase and I had to smile when it was advertised as having an outside zip for the travel documents. No way Jose - my belongings are treated like the crown jewels and with me at all times. My husband's not even allowed to keep his own passport - he has to give it back to me as soon as Border Agency have seen it!Edited: 5 years ago "
"I've always wondered what they actually DO with these passports. I understand they all sold on, but with the security on them, with laser chip etc, how can they not appear obviously tampered with and therefore useless??"
"Just as an aside perhaps someone with better legal knowledge might be able to answer this but in the scenario described in this thread who should the crime be reported to ? The flight originated in the UK using an Irish based carrier. Assuming a passenger on that flight stole the passports but unsure when, the theft might have taken place on Spanish soil or in mid-air so who would have the responsibility to investigate the theft ? The carrier will have names and contact details of everyone on board (crew included) so we wre not looking for a needle in a haystack here - 200 potential suspects or thereabouts tops. Did you report it to the UK police on return ?Perhaps I'm getting all cop show here but I know if it was me I would be determined to do all I could."
"As John McEnroe famously said ""You cannot be serious!"" Did you want all potential suspects recalled from their holidays to be interviewed?Maxine has already said she reported it to police. She was determined not to let the whole nasty experience ruin her holiday. She was good enough to come on to the forum and alert others and probably doesn't wish to re-live it any more, It is extremely unlikely she will ever know whodunnit ;o)"
"If you can't be sure when or when these passports were taken, can you say beyond reasonable doubt that they were in fact stolen?"
No Fussy i wasn't suggesting that. All i was getting at was that if it was reported to UK police and they looked at the passenger list between that and Ryanair records they have quite quickly been able to identify any passenger on board who was flying frequently and hence may be making a living from this sort of crime. No need to interview anyone just get the passenger list and X-ref that to ryanair's records. I doubt hugely that a crime of the one described would be a one off opportunistic theft. Why report it via this forum if you don't want to re-live it ? it was abviously going to provoke a response and I'm sure every single one of us know that passports need to be kept secure at all times. Just accepting it will never stop it for others.
Aaah gotcha. I would have made a good detective................cry!!!
Once at Gatwick the people sitting on a chair next to us in departures put their bag by mistake on our trolley. When we unpacked we couldn't work out how we had two passports and boarding cards in our hand luggage.It was the days of most people using package holidays and we guessed the company but the local reps didn't really want to know. We had wondered why the Monarch flight which was scheduled to take off ten minutes before us wasn't at LPA when we landed and still hadn't landed as the coach left the airport (it was much smaller then and you could see this sort of thing)people can be careless so I am very neurotic now when I travel and triple check everything
when we reported to the police in las palmas they wasnt interested as they say they deal with it all day long and when we went to the embassy to get emergency travel it was them who told us there is people flying in and out daily to do it...i only put this up to make people aware and on guard as ive said i travel all the time several times a year and are very careful yet it still happened..its more so people realise what extra copies etc they should put in there big case just to help in this situation happy holidays peeps im off again as soon as new passport arrives
"HI maxine,Glad everything was sorted for you in the end. Can I just ask what extra precautions you are going to take as you have said you are already over cautious? ;o)"
My friend just had his bag stolen at Palma airport with all his documents he put it down for 1 second he reckons .Apparently its an epidemic all over Europe at the moment so keep hold of your valuables where ever you travel.
