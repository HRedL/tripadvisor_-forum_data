"More details release on COVID-19 testing requirements:https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/covid-19-…From Link:“The Islands of Tahiti are Covid-19 free. In order to keep them that way, the Government of French Polynesia is requiring a PCR Covid-19 test.These are normally performed via nasopharyngeal swab and they detect the genetic information of the virus, the RNA, and show a positive result only if the virus is present and someone is actively infected. PCR tests are used to directly detect the presence of an antigen, rather than the presence of the body’s immune response, or antibodies. By detecting viral RNA, which will be present in the body before antibodies form or symptoms of the disease are present, these tests can tell whether or not someone has the virus very early on. PCR tests have an extremely high degree of reliability.Within the Southern California area, Air Tahiti Nui suggests visiting a Reliant Urgent Care center for Covid-19 testing. There are 5 locations spread accross Southern California. The LAX location on Century Blvd is open 24/7 and in most cases is able to provide results within 48 hours of testing. For clients who present their Air Tahiti Nui ticket, there is a reduced charge of $149 per test, payable directly to Reliant medical center. Click the following link to visit the Reliant Urgent Care center website:http://www.ReliantCovid.comIf originating outside of Southern California, it is recommended to contact your Physician or a local urgent care center who may be able to recommend a PCR testing site or perform the test themselves.The entry requirements for French Polynesia stipulate that testing must be done no earlier than 72 hours prior to departure of the flight to Tahiti. It is strongly suggested that this test be conducted immediately after the 72 hour mark, to ensure the test result prior to flight departure.All passengers must present a medical certificate issued by the testing location showing a negative PCR test upon check-in for their Air Tahiti Nui flight. Without this test documentation, the airline absolutely is not able to board any passenger. If a test result is positive, you may change your travel date without charge from Air Tahiti Nui. Please check with your connecting airline for their ticket conditions.For further information on entry requirements please visit the Tahiti Tourisme website by clicking the following link:https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19It is the passengers responsibility to secure all necessary tests and to follow these guidelines for entry.”"
Thank you for posting this additional information!This could be difficult to get the results back quick enough.
"Well, at least that makes it pretty clear that (as things stand) we ought to forget about our trip. We are (were?) flying into SFO from London and - assuming no flight delays or schedule changes or outright cancellations or continuing bans on UK travellers - won't get out of the airport until about 5pm on a Monday. We have to check in for our SFO to PPT flight at about 10am on the Thursday. So, realistically, we couldn't plan on taking a test (even if we can find a location happy to test foreign tourists without any symptoms) before the Tuesday morning and we'd have to be 100% confident of getting the documented results back by the Wednesday evening - a 36-hour turnround, failing which everything falls apart.Of course, much could change by September, when we are due to travel. But it's hard to see the Covid-19 context being dramatically better by then and I'm sure that the FP authorities will still be as determined as ever to protect their islands. The regulations may be tweaked, and may become more practical for West Coast or US travellers with easy flight connections, but visitors from further afield will probably continue to face huge hurdles. And this is no way to look forward to a dream holiday.....Edited: 5:37 am, June 12, 2020 "
"Cw-10, you’re in the same situation as us but we are leaving much sooner (end of July) our BA flight to LA has already been cancelled so I’m looking into seeing if I can change my Air Tahiti Nui flights to leave from Paris instead of LA and pay the fare difference."
"This 72 hour test requirement will be a challenge to many Air Tahiti Nui customers in the coming weeks/months.If I were a gambler, I'd bet something will change regarding this 72 hour test time frame."
"This is very complicated and seems to only work if you live near Los Angeles. We are flying in from the mid-west US, so a day is lost getting to LA and the test turn around is around 3 days, so you could be at the airport in LA praying u get the results before the flight departs ELSE FLY BACK home."
"It's not just ATN customers. This will be a problem for people flying on UA from SFO. Most of us will be coming from elsewhere in the US and have to connect in SFO. We will have problems finding a place to get the test done and results back within the 72 hour timeframe in our hometowns.Once the FP government sees how few people will be on the first few weeks flights due to not being able to get tested in time, Tahiti will have to relax the timeframe for the testing to be done. Or FP will have to make results from an instant test acceptable."
"I'm in the same situation. I would fly from the midwest to SFO in early September. Then board United to get to Tahiti. Right now as things stand, I couldn't get the testing results in time to board. I'll see how things go, but it makes me nervous. I'm a planner and I like to have a plan. Does anyone know if there are details on the Travel Insurance requirement? I never buy travel insurance and not sure what company would cover pandemic stuff. I would need to get details on exactly what they are looking for with that."
While the more typical test may take 2-3 days to result there is a rapid test that provides results in 5-45 minutes. You can check around to see what is available.
"Thanks, Michelle."
"Medic_5, I could be wrong but my understanding was that the rapid tests were not PCR tests. That all PCR tests still had to be done in a lab taking at least 24 hours typically and possibly more depending on the backlog. Which as we expand who can test and how many are available these labs are definitely going to get backed up. I absolutely could be wrong. I couldn't find any information online about rapid PCR tests but maybe I've looked in the wrong place. If there aren't I certainly hope there will be though."
In England you can get a PCR Test that’s back within 2hours but it’s £350 per person. I’m hoping by July it will be cheaper!
"There are 3 approved antigen tests for covid which are very accurate. We use one in my ED for patients that need emergent surgery or other Interventions which are time sensitive. I would think that either a PCR or antigen test would meet the ATN requirements as they are not specific in what they require, other than a negative test for the disease"
It would have to be a PCR test it’s mentioned in the Tahiti Tourism website.
I took the PCR test in April. Its not for the faint of heart. Think Arnold in Total Recall.But I will do it again for entry to FP.
"Im supposed to be heading to FP in Sept for my honeymoon and I find it almost impossible to meet these requirements for a normal person at the moment. You'll be rushing and it'll be last minute. As of now, these tests take over 24 hours to get a result and then have to get a doctors note? At the hospital where I work, you'd have to fill out a release of information, which has to be processed, then the doctors provides the letter when they can. This can take over a week. Hopefully we'll have more testing available in the near future. Even though its a hassle, FP is doing the right thing to keep their country safe. I hope maybe they can change it to a week instead of within 72 hours of flight, even 5 days is more doable."
"Hi Medic_5 Thanks, I'll have to do more research. They do specify PRC test is required though. I see now there are rapid tests but can only be rapid when tested with specialized equipment that isn't available everywhere. Otherwise, it has to be sent to a central lab. So unless you are close to a facility that has that specialized equipment you are stuck with waiting longer than 24 hrs at least. But hopefully, as time goes on more and more places will have this specialized equipment and make it easier on everyone for more than just travel!"
Any more updates on potential solutions to the 72 hour turnaround for covid testing? I’m facing a 6/30/2020 deadline on cancelling my prepaid reservation with four seasons. These requirements are sounding more and more like getting covid test results in the 72 hour window are not feasible for most folks. Any additional thoughts out there?
https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/? Published Friday.
"Hey Michelle, since you're from portland, do you know of any places that do it electively?"
"Ben, no, last I checked Oregon's guidelines don't allow any elective PCR testing. You are required to have symptoms in order to get one done. No exceptions. :( I keep checking, you have to have a doctor request the test for you and they have strict guidelines they are following. Keep an eye on the Oregon Health Authority website, they will let us know when we can gain access selectively and they also list out the locations where testing can be done. Fingers crossed elective testing will be allowed in Oregon soon!"
"Thanks Michele, I'm thinking of taking my belated 10-year anniversary in August before school restarts, but its not looking like a great idea....yet"
Same here in Abq. Just say you feel weak and slight cough. I realize its a bit fibbing but what else are going to do?
"For those flying ATN from LAX - the flight is scheduled to leave daily from LAX at 1155pm. Counting backwards 72 hours, its impossible to take the test at 1155pm at night 3 days before. So are you all taking the test the morning of the following day? I hope Im explaining myself okay :)!"
"Insurance is no longer required to fly to French Polynesia. I am scheduled to fly to Tahiti from LA on July 18. I contacted the Tahiti Tourism people about what specific kind of insurance is required, and they said it is no longer necessary. Here's their response from June 23: This requirement has been updated and is no longer needed as long as you can self-certify you will cover your own medical and repatriation costs should you test positive for Covid-19 while in the destination. Our website has been updated accordingly: https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/"
"Hello! You actually could take it at 11:55pm three days prior, at least if you go to the location near LAX. They are open 24 hours. I am taking it at midnight the following day (so, five minutes later!). Because I want to take it as soon as humanly possible. BUT, they told me the samples don't leave the facility to go to the lab until 10pm each day! So, lot of time wasted there. I'm still scheduled to take it at midnight, though. Sounds like you and I are going through exactly the same thought process (and anxiety)!"
"FYI, my message above was for Jyotsnacs. I'm new to Trip Advisor, so figuring things out! (Super helpful that there are other folks who are concerned about the Covid test, thanks for the input!)"
Hey Andrea ! Good to know .. I’m actually flying from SFO to LAX. So I’ll be taking the test in SFO. Found a place that guarantees within 24-48 hours. Fingers crossed both of us get it on time !
Jyotsnacs Can you share test center name in San Francisco?
"Geziyoz - Its by Stanford Medical center, my doctor is reffering me to them. You can also try the Stanford Urgent centers /express cares. They guarantee within 24-72 hours and they are very well aware of covid tests for travel as many destinations and states are now requiring it."
"Hi guys, so glad to found a post about it. I'm due to fly LAX-PPT July 15 from Canada, unfortunately in Canada no lab can guarantee the window period of 48 hours to get results and because I have to fly to LA the day prior to the ATN flight I decided to just do my layover in LA and get tested there by the lab near the airport. Now I don't know if I should fly 12 or 13. Flights land at 4pm both days so I'm tempted to take the flight on the 13th and get tested as soon as I land so that leaves me 48 hours prior to the ATN flight.... I know 12 would be safest but I don't want to hang in LA for 3 nights... ugh this is all so stresfull."
"Also if I fly in LA on the 12th and do my test in the evening I will be a few hours over the 72 hours limit... as the flight leaved on the 15th at 11.55pm, but if wait next day I will have just 48 hours... I think I will consider the 12th even if the test is 80ish hours before the flights that's technically just 3 days. I'll just spend an extra night layover but at least I will have the peace of mind - given the number of increased cases in Cali I think there will be backlog with the lab and getting results back!"
"Tim, be aware that currently, it is not stating ""3 days"" it is stating ""72 hours"" which means your test, if administered 80 hours prior to departure will not be valid or accepted. It needs to be 72 hours or less."
"Hi Michelle, you are right. The online booking system for the clinic in LAX (Reliant urgent case) specifics for ATN Flights only allow booking starting the 13th at midnight which is right when the 72 hours mark starts before the flight. I called the clinic to confirm that (by the way Eve the coordinator responsible for the ATN clearance testing is very helpful and friendly) told me to come get tested on the 13th morning which means I will still have to fly to LA on the 12th night and spend 3 nights in LA as coming from Canada leaving on the 13th I would not make it until the end of the day which only leaves 48 hours window period. Anyway since I will be on the first ATN flights LAX-PPT I will let you guys know how this goes. fingers crossed and good luck to everyone!"
"Hi Tim, Thank you for your info. Very helpful! Good luck and looking forward to your update."
"Hello, fellow travelers. Have you seen that visitors to French Polynesia now have to fill out a form within 72 hours of your flight? It is here: https://www.etis.pf/. I decided to do a ""test"" submission, to see if there were any bugs. When it asks your nationality, (if you are American) sometimes the selectable answer is États-Unis, sometimes United States. When you enter phone numbers, there can't be any spaces (which they refer to as ""special characters""). And, when I got to the final summary page where it aggregates all my answers, it was a mish mash of info, which I wasn't able to correct. Tim, could you please let us know if you are able to fill out this form without problems? Thank you!!!!!Edited: 1:59 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"Also, I have a little bit of info about the Covid test at Reliant Urgent Care (by LAX). Normally, they only send the samples to the lab once a day, at midnight. Gobs of time wasted there. But now, they are doing a noon delivery as well. And they assured me that they are working with the lab to handle the increased volume that the Air Tahiti Nui flights will be generating. Fingers crossed!"
"Thank you for this info, Andrea!"
"Sure! By the way, I just reached out to Tahiti Tourism to let them know the form they are requiring we fill out has bugs. (Or at least it didn't work for me.) Also, I just re-read an old email from Air Tahiti Nui, and realized we need to submit our test results directly to them as soon as we have them. https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/covid-formEdited: 2:40 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"Hi Andrea - I haven't tried to fill the ETIS form yet as it says it should not be filled out more than 3 days prior departure so I will do it once I have my test result back. However I did not really understand what kind of bugs you encountered? Weren't you able to go back to fix the errors? On the main page there is an option 'Modify my file'. If you need help, you should contact them at this address contact@etis.pf instead of Tahiti tourism! I'll update you guys earlier this week on how it goes for me... In addition my understanding was that the copy of the test result needs to be uploaded both on the ETIS and ATN website."
"Hi, Tim! It could just be my computer, or I could be doing something incorrectly. But, when I get to the step in the process that says ""Data Verification,"" this is where all my answers are aggregated. But, the info is all scrambled. For example, date of birth: 1 Last name: D It's like little bits of info ""stuck"" but not much of it. And I can't edit it. If I click ""Modify My File"" this just takes me to a page where I can change an already-submitted file to do something like, for example, edit the return date of my flight if that gets changed. You probably won't have problems, it is probably just me!!!!!! But if you do, could you let us know? Thanks! (And thanks for that other email address, great suggestion.) Andrea"
"Andrea, thanks for the update on reliant lab pick up time! ! We will move our booking 2 hours earlier to catch the noon pick up."
Terrific! (Hope the info Reliant gave me about the noon pickup was right!)
"Hi, there. I called Reliant (LAX) to confirm the noon pickup time. I spoke with Eve, and she said that yes, the lab picks up the samples twice a day now, noon and midnight. But, they only run the tests at midnight, so that noon pickup doesn't seem to be saving us travelers any test time. I'm on the Saturday, 11:55pm flight, so I basically lose a whole day with my test sitting in limbo."
"Andrea, thanks again for calling them to confirm. That is interesting... I am guessing they may use the noon pick up as a backup in case they finish prior batch sooner. Either way, it won't do any harm. :-)"
"I had initially book a spot to take my test tomorrow morning but I decided to just do it this evening since I made it to LAX today. I went to Reliant and they told me I was the first one to take it for the ATN flight clearance, I'm at 78 hours before the flight but still within the 3 days as you guys discussed below and they said it was fine. Also, they were not able to confirm 24 hours turnaround, they said it can take up to 48 hours so definitely glad I went today to have some wiggle room. Now the waiting game begins. I feel like a rat lab, being on the first flight! It was a long day as I had to take 2 flights to get to LAX from where I live, and even more frustrating that I had a layover in Vancouver and saw the Air Tahiti Nui Paris-Papeete plane doing its technical layover exactly across my boarding gate there!. People were just unboarding and locked at the gate through the glass walls so they could stretch their legs while they were refilling the plane with fuel. Ugh if only I could have jumped on that plane.... Anyway about the test for anyone that has never done it before: I had the test done already a couple months ago, so I knew what to expect, but interesting to note that in Canada they only do one nostril and here they did two (I think doing both is standard practice anyway). I had to wait 10-15 minutes which was fair given my appointment was for tomorrow then the test itself was done in less than 5 minutes and was less painful than my first one for some reasons (maybe cause I was tired!?). The people at the clinic are very friendly and the space is very clean which made me feel very comfortable walking in and waiting a bit there."
"On a side note, LAX airport was s*** show, it was definitely a contrast coming from a clean almost empty airport like Vancouver. As soon as I arrived in LAX it was packed and it felt like business as usual which seems insane for me. Anyway, all of this to say, for anyone travelling via LAX to FP, make sure to take all the precautions that you can. I'm pretty sure anyone planning to visit FP is already well accustomed to all the sanitary measures but still, make sure you have a bunch of masks so that you can keep changing them every 3-4 hours, and wash your hands ALL the time. I had my hydro-alcoholic gel in my shirt pocket for easy access and I would literally just wash my hands as soon as I would touch something which means sometimes every 5 minutes. There is nothing that can be 'too much' or 'excessive' when it comes down to protecting yourself."
"Great updates! Tim, you are our guinea pig! Thanks for all the detail."
Thanks for the update Tim. Good luck on the result !
Wow Tim. I am so glad you made it to LA but shocked to hear that is was packed!?? Every time anyone I know has posted a picture from an airport it looks like no one is there. I guess that is changing...... Yikes!!!I am excited to hear how quick you get your results! Stay safe it LA until you can leave for FPSue
"Tim, most grateful for your intel, thanks!!!! I find it very interesting that you were able to just show up at Reliant early and take the test (now that it's 3 days instead of 72 hours). Super helpful info, as I will do the same thing if I can't get my (midnight!) appointment changed to an earlier one. Thanks again for the info!"
"Good luck, Tim! Stay safe in LA until you have to catch your flight. We have to do the same in Paris. I have booked an airport and don't plan to leave the room!! xEdited: 7:59 am, July 13, 2020 "
Thanks for keeping us updated Tim! That's crazy to hear! Stay safe!
Here are the self-instructions explained in a video for the second covid test (4 days after landing in FP) https://www.youtube.com/watch…
"So how is the self testing going to work for those of us who will be on a cruise ship on day 4? I arrive at PPT on Jan.12, board Wind Spirit on Jan. 14. On Jan. 16 I will be docked at Raiatea. What happens with the sample, where would it be dropped off? There is no way this will work for visitors coming to FP for either the Windstar or Paul Gaugin cruise. For Americans who don't live in LA or who are flying on UA, it will be extremely difficult for us to get our test results back by the 72 hour deadline to even board our flights.Once the cruises resume in September, something will have to change. Either the government will have to change the parameters of the testing or the cruises will be cancelled leading to many tourist visits also being cancelled. I wouldn't keep the flights and just stay in a hotel in FP for 10 days in place of a cruise. That is the reason I am going. I don't know how may pax the Paul Gaugin holds, but Wind Spirit has 150 people onboard and if the cruises are cancelled that's at least 150 less visitors not going to FP.I hope it all goes well but relying on people to do self swabs is a recipe for contamination of the samples. Not going to give accurate results."
"Hi Susie - I suspect you will have to do the test on your cruise and drop it to the personnel on board who will be responsible for dropping it to the authority of your next stopover, whatever that might be. It's just my opinion but there is definitively a solution to accommodate people going on a cruise. I think I heard somewhere that the first cruises in July will only have local people so you might have to wait a few weeks for the authorities to outline a protocol."
"A huge thanks to everyone contributing here. Your info is priceless and so much appreciated. A special thanks to Tim for being one of the first to brave this uncertain times of international travel, particularly to FP. Sounds like we'll be able to stick to our plan of traveling in early September...fingers crossed all goes well, and everyone does the right thing and follow the rules and hopefully FP will remain open. Hope everyone stays safe & healthy. Cheers to you all and thanks again!P.S. Don't forget to wear sunscreen all day, everyday!Edited: 4:50 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"I am still looking for test options. Our flight is from SFO on August 22nd. We live in Pleasanton, CA. It looks like I have big problems.1. My wife does not want to take the test. :) I hope I will convince her.2. I talked with my healthcare provider. (kaiser). They are sending test requests for me and my wife but not for kids. We have 2 little daughters. They are 3 and 4 years old. They only do tests for kids if they have symptoms. Doctor also said to check with them in August. She mentioned procedures change quickly.3. Kaiser doesn't guarantee results in 3 days. They said 3 to 5 days."
Gez-I am in Abq but have been told the state testing comes back faster rather than private health insurers. Go figure.
I'm finding all posts that have Tim in them to cheer him on. You can do it Tim!!! Keep reporting back!!!!
"Geziyozbiz - I was supposed to take the Kaiser test too but they are overloaded now and could take delayed as you said. However, I am now booked for a Stanford travel test in 3 weeks. They guarantee in 48 hours. They have tests now specifically for travel and its at no cost. Sue from this forum is also taking the test from there. They have locations in Palo Alto and San Jose, so you would probably have to drive all the way here from Pleasanton. Here is the no : 650-498-9000. Hope this helps!"
Hahah thanks for cheering me up Cupcake and sending all those positive vibes!!!!!!
Thanks Jyotsna. I will contact with them.
does anyone know what the testing requirement is for children travelling from SFO to PPT on United Airlines? Child less than one year of age?
"Amerie63, looks like baby needs to be tested too. (Yikes) You may want to contact them to clarify. From the website: ""carry out an RT-PCR screening test for all passengers regardless of their age (no minimum age).""…gouv.fr/Actualites/Communiques-de-presse/20…"
amerie63We are in same boat.
"gotcha. right it's just crazy to me why would my baby need to prove test results if both adults travelling with, present a negative test? hypothetically of course. i have not looked into where i could actually get him tested but have secured a testing facility for the adults. I have emailed tahiti tourisme (waiting for email response) and spoke to air tahiti nui (the california customer service number) - rep told me they will require the baby to also present test results."
We rescheduled for the end of the year/the holidays but we were planning on going in August with our one year old (almost 2). And it was confirmed to me by Tahiti Tourisme that she would need a test as well. I called around and found a private clinic in LA that does the RT PCR test via mouth swab and with decent turn around time. That was much more palatable to me than a nasal culture for her! Maybe you can find a place in the Bay Area that does the same? Perhaps even your pediatrician. But I had the same argument/thought as well. If we BOTH are negative it seems easy to assume she would also be. I understand their reasoning obviously just didn’t/don’t love the idea of it! :)
That find that quite interesting as well... One thing I was reading though on ATN website is that the 4 days later self test only applies to kids over 6 years old. I'm wondering why they don't keep the same logic for the 72 hours test
Oh I actually did not know that part about only kids over 6 for the 4 days test. I haven’t followed as closely now that we rescheduled. That’s good to know (provided it remains the same in a few months which obviously anything could change by then!). Thanks for the info!
"HI, Tim! Good luck on your flight today. I was wondering, did you need to print out the Covid results? If so, where did you go to print it (maybe your hotel?). Thanks, and see ya in Tahiti!"
Yes looking forward to seeing what has been happening with those travelling from the US out to FP... please share your experiences here!
"Andrea, I remember Tim saying last night that he did print out his results but that others were just showing it on their phones at check-in with no problems."
"Shoot, now that I think about it, that might have been another person on the Bora Bora FB group that flew out last night as well. Someone reported that they printed theirs but notice others showing theirs on their phone with no problem at the airport. He also said that the gate that Air Tahiti Nui flew out of felt safe and there were not huge crowds (compared to the rest of LAX).I think I am going to print my Covid and ETIS pages just to be safe!"
"Hi Sue, which Bora Bora FB group are you referring to? I'd love another place to follow along as our trip gets closer!"
"It is called ""Off to Bora Bora ! (and the Polynesian islands)"" It is a private group so you just need to ask to join. There are 3,600 members and only started about a month ago.."
Hello - now that flights have resumed has anyone gotten their test in time? Where were you able to get a test within 72 hours? Did you use Reliant in LA - at this time it seems like the only viable option? What was the process - did the airline collect the test at departure? Once arrived were you given the self test? If you test positive- would you be asked to leave FP? Thank you.
Please tell us your experience. I fly out Monday night Thank u
Anyone know what happens if you test positive after the 4 day test period
Does anyone knows what happens if you are Covid positive & flying on Air France or United airlines?
"""Does anyone knows what happens if you are Covid positive & flying on Air France or United airlines?""Uh, you won't be allowed on the flight. You had to ask this?"
I'm also wondering what happens if you test positive while in FP on day 4??? Anyone have any info on this? Do they mandate a 2 week quarantine?
We are NOT asking about the test PRIOR to flying. It’s the mandatory test foot days AFTER arrival.
Yes it’s a two week quarantine at your own expense (Or insurance if you happen to find coverage that covers pandemic expenses which is hard to find and expensive).
"On https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/? , it says ""A SARS-CoV-2 virus genome test (the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test) has to be carried out by all travelers in a health authority center (hospital, clinic, medical centre, Covid-19 testing Center, or medical analysis laboratory) within three days before the flight to Tahiti (at the passenger’s expense).Ex: If the flight departs on a Monday at 11pm, the passenger needs to take the test the preceding Friday and receive the test results between that Friday and the scheduled flight departure time on Monday.""That implies that the limit is three days vs 72 hours, especially given the wording of the example."
"The Tahiti Tourisme FAQ at https:/…0034615036d4208c49c0e says that the traveler ""need to present a negative result to the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome test (e.g. the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test) to the airline staff upon check-in prior to boarding the flight to French Polynesia""Our DEN-SFO flight departs at 10:05a MDT, connecting to SFO-PPT departing at 1:20p PDT -- all on United. I'm trying to determine if we'll need to show the test results to the gate agent at SFO (or DEN), or if we'll need to enter them somehow when we do our online check-in the day before.Has anyone here flown to Tahiti on United since 7/15/20?"
"For what it's worth, here's how the French press release describes what happens if the fourth-day test is positive:""If a case of Covid is found, he will be immediately isolated and taken care of by the health organization Polynesian. If it is in the archipelagos, the Country will proceed to its immediate extraction by a flight health center to Taaone Hospital where he will undergo a medical examination. If the positive case is confirmed, this person will be placed in isolation in dedicated accommodation.""(that's a Google translated snippet of the press release at http://www.polynesie-francaise.pref.gouv.fr/content/download/45217/273576/file/Communiqu%C3%A9%20-%20Mise%20en%20ligne%20de%20la%20plateforme%20d'enregistrement%20ETIS.pdf -- I couldn't find an official version in English)Edited: 3:58 pm, July 18, 2020 "
emptynestco - United is only resuming their SFO-PPT route on August 4th. So I dont think anyone has flown the route since the opening of FP. And you are right it is 3 days and not 72 hours. I am flying Air Tahiti Nui and we have to upload our results before we depart on their website. I am flying SFO to LAX to PPT and they said that they would check the results when we depart SFO I think.. (especially since I have to upload the results online prior to any check in).
"Cw-As Bill Clinton once said, I feel your pain. Can you change to next summer? ATN is giving us that option."
"I am flying out of SFO on United on 8/4 (the first flight out since the lifting of Quarantine).I called United today, they said we do not have to upload Covid results. They said just bring the results with us and they will look at them during check-in.Hope that helps."
"Thank you, that is helpful! So hard to know what to do!!"
"We are supposed to fly from Denver on the Aug 11th flight. I have called all around Denver and found that National Jewish Hospital has a 24-48 hr turnaround on their covid testing and will do travel testing with a Dr RX. We had our Dr write the script on Friday and fax it in and are waiting for the call to schedule, hoping to schedule now for Sat Aug 8th testing. We are a family of 4 adults going so it is stressful! I will let you know if we are able to schedule.Edited: 6:59 pm, July 19, 2020 "
Familytravels007 - Glad you were able to find a place to get tested! We are being super careful to not be around anyone who is not sheltering away from other people. We want to make sure we can pass the Covid test and head to French Polynesia!!!! Starting to get excited now!!
"Thanks, Sue! Showing test results at the gate makes the 72 hour requirement much more doable. Will look forward to hearing how your trip goes. Fais bon voyage!"
"Thanks for the pointer, familytravels007. Here's hoping you get the appointment time you need! Please let us know how the scheduling/testing/results process goes at NJH."
"Just wanted to Update that we are are scheduled for COvid tests on Aug 8th, 3 days prior to our flight Aug 11 from Denver thru San Francisco on United. National Jewish Hospital does guarantee results in 24-48 hrs, so tit is great to have that option for those in Colorado. If you are scheduling I would advise you to follow up with phone calls- my Dr faxed the Rxs on Friday, when I did not hear anything from scheduling over the weekend I called the hospital on Moday and they said some info was missing on the referral forms. They did not call the Dr or me to notify us of this. Then when the Dr office fixed the form and resent, I did not hear for another 2 days and when I called the hospital they said they had not recieved the resent fax. More calls to the Dr office to re-fax and then a follow up call to the hospital to actually get the tests scheduled. Luckily I was doing this 3 weeks prior, or it would have been even more stressful. National Jewish Hospital does require the Dr Rx so make sure you plan ahead with that. Starting to actually think this trip is going to happen!!"
"Sue, where did you find a place near SFO to do rapid testing? I'm flying out on the 8/6 flight, but I'm not an SF resident, and I can't find anywhere that offers rapid testing to people who just want to fly... :("
Does anybody have any information on where to test in orange county or LA area that will allow us to get our test results back before our departure. I cannot seem to find a place that can get results back before 72 hours guaranteed.

"Hi, May I ask where you are getting tested?I called Reliant urgent care in Los Angeles for an appt for covid19 PCR test and they said they are no longer doing this for travelers. They stopped this service last week. Have anyone used Concierge MD Beverley Hills or goodlife (recommended on air tahiti website)?Thanks a lot"
I went to Reliant on Sunday. Not sure that info is accurate
All - the rules have just been updated to accept Rapid tests!! https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/french-po…
Arent rapid ones antigen. I am not sure thats accurate the rapid ones are accepted.
"No, they are not. Rapid tests are accepted; antigen ones are not. Read the linked website."
Ill take your word for it. Good luck and be safe.
I'm coming from Colorado too! We're traveling Aug 30th. Which testing center are you using?
Brittney its hard to say if Tahiti will accept the Colorado test. They would not accept the New Mexico test as it wasnt familiar to them. We flew in early to LA to get it accepted. Its the state of affairs lately.
This seems it could be a very stressful process and a headache if you indeed do test positive for some reason before coming. You virtually would probably lose all the money you invested in the flights and resorts.
"Its very much a headache agreed.But I will admit planes are at low capacity, lines are shorter et al. Its kind of worth it honestly."
"I took my test with https://www.relianturgentcare.com/the one right by LAX at 5901 W Century Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90045.I took it at 9am on 8/5, and had my results by noon on 8/6.They told me that their lab picks up everyday at 11am so if you test before then you will get faster results. They are the people Air Tahiti suggested I use and they are in the same building as Air Tahiti's LA office. The test they ran says ""SARS-COV-2"" on the results page and this was acceptable to Air Tahiti.Hope others find this info useful."
Same here Michelle. Bunch of FP travelers were there getting tests done.
"This 72 hour COVID test result is going to pretty much be a deal killer for our trip in September. We are in Portland, Oregon and have not found a single facility willing and able to get us tested 72 hours prior to departure and get results in time. We will likely have to cancel unless things change."

"Sylvie, I'm with you there! Also in Portland, Oregon. According to the Oregon Health Authority, they will only perform these tests if you have symptoms and even then can't guarantee timeframes. I heard someone else mention that a Walgreens in Hillsboro was offering them but I'm not confident that it's the right test. I didn't call as we had already decided to postpone. Just this week we reached out to our travel agent and had them move everything to next year instead. They are honoring the same prices for next year for us though. I was nervous about that when I started hearing people say the rates for next year significantly increased. Just too much stress for me! I am glad so many people are willing to go through all this work and effort. You guys are the champs here who will help continue to bring money into the region to help support them. Please just continue to respect the rules, wear masks and keep everyone healthy! We all know there was bound to be cases popping up but if they can be quickly contained so that they are small instances and not large outbreaks then things can continue. Thank you to everyone whether you are going, sharing information or just participating in the conversations. I love hearing peoples experiences and hearing people successfully enjoying paradise! I can't wait to share my own stories on here next year!"
"Our family is going to Bora Bora in 2 weeks We found a lab in LA, GenX, that offers the required PCR Covid 19 test with 24 hr test results. Hopefully we'll get the promised speedy test results!"
"In reference to the possibility of using a rapid test, it will not be acceptable to the French Polynesian government. They are very specific about this being a PCR test. All the rapid tests are antigen tests. Please, don't go that route.In response to the insurance question, I do know that they accept the insurance that comes with the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card. I'm certain other credit card insurance is accepted also.https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/covid-19-…The above location makes suggestions on where you might be able to be tested. Reliant Urgent Care was listed on their site, but they now have a new company suggested."
You are correct. Only PCR tests are acceptable.
"Did this end up working out - in other words, was the medical letter sufficient noting you needed for travel? Did you need to specify symptoms? Was turnaround time sufficient?"
can you provide me with the name and address of that place . I have a trip coming soon

"Hi Josh, I have heard great things about them too. The test they use isn’t on the approved lab list that was released 8/8. Not sure if they will be accepted. A lot of confusion."
"Does anyone know if we can use a lab that is not on approved list but is a EUA approved PCR test? Really confused on the labs... I booked a test (and paid $400) in LA that said they were approved for all travel but I then saw their lab wasn't on Tahiti's ""approved"" list. Are they going to check the lab? Or will a negative PCR test suffice?"
"I was told by email by atn that if the test says rt-pcr then it will be ok. Also got an email from Tahiti tourism department that says in one paragraph the test has to be on the list, and in another paragraph it says that “for now” as long as it say rt-pcr it will be accepted and to check with atn. So it’s kind of confusing but I think the my concierge md test should be ok. Not 100% sure though. Here’s my dilemma... I have pretty good insurance that with reimburse me for any Covid test I take. But they won’t reimburse expediting fees. Good life bills $175 for the test and $125 for the rush. Concierge bills a straight $225. Since I’m paying for 4 that is $500 out of pocket to go with goodlife. Additionally goodlife doesn’t take calls and takes a long time to respond to emails. If something goes wrong how can I know I can count on them?"
