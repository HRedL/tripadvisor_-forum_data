"I am looking to go to an all inclusive resort in August, but have been hearing that the Swine Flue is back in Mexico!! Ahhhhh! has anyone else heard this?? is it true??"
"If you use the title of your post as a Google search term, you'll find lots of info.""It is now considered a seasonal flu and included in the flu vaccine."" - CBS News / Scientific American"
Swine flu? Not worth worrying about if you are healthy IMO.
"If the media scares everyone off like they did last time, you'll have the place almost to yourself."
"WallyWilsonTexas it was not the media but the mexican Govt. They closed all Govt offices and all schools country wide. So cannot blame that on the media, that is something worth reporting on that a country orders schools and Govt offices closed, created a fear that the media reported on."
"If so, air fare drops.... lol we went durning the ""big swine flu episode"" and got $99.00 pp round trip non-stop Philadelphia. lol"
"""Mexico flu deaths raise fears of global epidemic"" MSNBC""Mexico swine flu outbreak triggers global pandemic fears"" The GuardianMedia panic from 2009."
"Just to clarify - the Mexican government closed schools and government buildings in 2009 not 2012! This was a short term measure to stop the spread of the virus. There is no flu epidemic right now and no school closures. Yes, this is the flu season but there are no more sick people than normal."
"Steves, the US CDC issued a travel advisory which, in my opinion, caused the drop in tourism that year."
"It absolutely is out there. My daughter just returned from a fabulous holiday in Cancun, and promptly came down with a full-blown case of swine flu two days later. She didn't remember anyone being sick in Mexico, but was horrified at all the sick, coughing people in LAX (where she had a layover). She thinks that is where she caught it."
did she have her flu shot?
The doctor confirmed it was swine flu with a lab culture?
"I hope its back!! I took 11 of us for $4100.00 total everything! Prices dropped so dramaticaly, I was amazed. Spen 8 glorious days with 10 other people on what I have spent on 2 people..."
"ttcl1, My husband and I went to Excellence Playa Mujeres, roof top terrace room and non-stop air for 10 days for 1600.00 for both of us. The airfare is almost that much now. It was a sweet deal."
"That is a deal! We were t the Oasis Palm Beach ( budget, family place ) and went thru bookit.com LOL, what caught my eye was it was $208.00 pp with flights for 7 nights. With taxes and trasfers, it ended up being like $380.00 pp, but still, that was 1995 prices in 2009..."
"Bring it on! Got deals so good last time that I had to sign a confidentiality agreement that I would not talk about it. However, unlike a hurricane where when you loose your job at the resort you have one doing clean-up and re-construction; the last swine flu drama parade was brutal on the economy in Cancun and the people trying to work there."
"I got swine flu after I went to Mexico in 2009...five months after we got back, LOL. Everyone was so worried about us going to Mexico during the flu scare. Nevermind that I work in a hospital and was surrounded by people with the flu."
Obama's kid is in Mexico with 12 of her friends right now. Do you think the US Prez would send his kid there if there's swine flu?
"The flu is going around in cancun but the local ""health dept."" has been giving away the flu shots like crazy for free. My family has all had theres and we do not know anyone that has had it. The schools have started if any child comes to school even with a runny noise they are not allowed in till its over. They are trying to keep it from spreading."
i'm eager to be in mexico this coming chistmas. is this flu news still a threat?www.flu2013.com
@ Kafeleip Swine flu is not the problem but there is the common cold going around right now. My kids just got over a resp. infection after 2 weeks and now a friend of there's is in the hospital sick. So just stock up on your normal vitamins and maybe a flu shot and you should be fine. Remember the days are warm but the nights are cool so pack accordingly. Enjoy your trip :)
