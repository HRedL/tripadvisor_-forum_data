"Hi, will my American fiancé be able to travel back to the UK with me in the current state of the world?"
Yes - but 14 days specific quarantine see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…
OP will also have to quarantine
"Thank you both for your responses, been looking online and there’s no yes or no answer that I was able to find. We have no problem self isolating :)"
"This has come up a few times now.Maybe Americans are being fed misleading info in their own Media.For the benefit of any doubt, no Nationality whatsoever is being denied entry to the UK.Certain Countries, America included, have to Quarantine for 14 Days on arrival, you must complete a Contact Form prior to presenting yourself at Immigration, failure to do so results in a £100 Fine.You must not leave your stated address for 14 days, someone (typically randomly 20%) will check you are adhering to the Rules.You must travel from the Airport to your stated address via Public Transport."
"To late to edit!That should be you must NOT, repeat NOT travel from the Airport to the stated address via public transport!"
"We were planning on taking a taxi from the airport to get home, we don’t have anyone to pick us up as far as I know, can we not do that?"
"Yes, you can take a taxi but you should wear a face covering."
Have you planned how you are going to get food delivered?
"As far as I know, shopping for essentials is allowed fuchsia, which makes it a mockery of the whole isolation system."
">>>That should be you must NOT, repeat NOT travel from the Airport to the stated address via public transport! <<<========The official UK Government advice is: "" *Only use public transport if you have no other option*. If you do use public transport, wear something that covers your nose and mouth and stay 2 metres apart from other people. Pack a face covering or scarf to cover your nose and mouth before you travel. ""The full guidance and rules can be found here:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…"
">> You must not leave your stated address for 14 days, someone (typically randomly 20%) will check you are adhering to the Rules. <<Is there any evidence that 20% of people quarantining are actually being checked up on once they get here? Last I heard there haven't been any reported cases yet of people being fined for breaching quarantine, and frankly I'd be surprised if there are any checks at all - where is the resource to go round visiting people supposed to come from?(That's not to say that people shouldn't follow the relevant rules, but I'm deeply sceptical about the government's ability to enforce quarantine and whether it actually makes much difference at this point.)Edited: 4:14 am, July 07, 2020 "
""" I'm deeply sceptical about the government's ability""Me too ;-)"
">>>Is there any evidence that 20% of people quarantining are actually being checked up on once they get here?

"Owl, I do not have that evidence.However, like you I watch the news, (don’t buy Papers) and on BBC I did hear it mentioned, and I’m pretty sure it was from a Government Source, that around 20% WOULD be randomly selected for “Spot Checks”.It has been revealed here in Scotland that not one single check has been undertaken, they say checks will begin from today."
Apparently checks will begin this week in Scotland. (as mentioned in the linked article above) Allegedly a lack of security clearance was stopping staff accessing details (so they say).Not sure if that is the case elsewhere in the UK
"Hi fuchsia my parents will have food taken care of, they have agreed to help us with whatever we need for those 2 weeks, very lucky to have great parents :)"
"Michael, if that is the case, then doesn’t the same problem affect the various “Track & Trace” Schemes that the 4 Constituent UK Governments are running?It also throws up the question of why did the Welsh and Scottish First Ministers kick up a fuss last week in protest at rUK opening up the Air Bridges.What’s the point in bawling and shouting and bumping their Gums at that move when they hadn’t even policed the original Quarantine Plan!My money is on nothing more than Political points scoring!"
"""Michael, if that is the case, then doesn’t the same problem affect the various “Track & Trace” Schemes that the 4 Constituent UK Governments are running?"" No idea, just commenting on what was said re the Scottish element.""It also throws up the question of why did the Welsh and Scottish First Ministers kick up a fuss last week in protest at rUK opening up the Air Bridges."" - because of the lack of contact between the various bodies? ""What’s the point in bawling and shouting and bumping their Gums at that move when they hadn’t even policed the original Quarantine Plan!"" - two wrongs don't make a right. ""My money is on nothing more than Political points scoring!"" _ in terms of points the UK government is not scoring well, it appears the others are perceived as doing rather better."
It seems that 2.5 million track and trace tests have not been returned. And the government wonders why?
And if your company gets you tested then you will be taxed as it is regarded as a benefit in kind.
"So anyone working as a carer who has a test provided by their employer every week will be taxed on all the tests? I’m guessing however that if you are a cabinet member that it won’t apply, somehow there will be another way of reading the rule on taxable benefits in their case.Edited: 11:46 am, July 07, 2020 "
"#21 Source, please."
#23 - here are a few reportshttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53324101https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politi…https:/…workers-who-regular-covid-19-18556653 https:/…1280447409080983553Things may of course change ;-)
"I thought you were making it up! On reflection, you couldn't make it up!As you say, things may change. I'd be amazed if they didn't."
"""I thought you were making it up! ""I wish I was, this government is beyond satire. As reported HMRC are currently following the letter of the law but hopefully there will be an exemption created for these tests."
According to the BBC report the Chancellor has promised to look at the issue “very quickly”!
OP - you mentioned your parents sorting your food out. Hope they don’t live with you otherwise they will need to isolate too...?
They unfortunately do live with me but they’re isolating for everything but essentials as they’re diabetic and scared of contracting the virus
Hope it all goes well for you.Keep safe.
"Yes, but he will have to fill out some forms, and then self-isolate for 14 days. Check out the gov.uk siteFor forms:https:/…how to self-isolate when entering the UKI hope this gives you some hope!Edited: 6:45 am, July 23, 2020 "
"Hi everyone, is this information still valid? Seeing loads of contradicting articles and we’re meant to be flying on Sunday"
The link in post #1 is to the live page of the U.K. government- whatever it says now is the rule today
What is the range of Tesco food delivery? Maybe that is an option for food.
