"First can I say please don’t shoot the messenger. I am only passing on what I have been reading on various Disney sites as to what Disney are considering in order to be able to open. It’s all speculation and may or may not happen but the following is what Disney are looking at.Prices going up on both tickets accommodation and food. I guess we all expected that as they try and recoup some losses. Temperature taking on entry. This has already been discussed on here. Now it gets more serious.No parades, fireworks or outdoor show ( like by the Magic Kingdom castle) as these encourage very large crowds to congregate. No close interaction with characters. Reduced numbers in all restaurants with tables far apart from each other.Social distancing in queues for fast food. Virtual queues for many rides to stop long lines. Reduced capacity in all parks and possibly only open at first for on site guests.In my opinion if some of these actually happen Disney will not be Disney anymore. Who wants to go to a Disney without parades or shows. You may as well go to your local funfair. I am sure there will be changes but if even half of these are put into practice I don’t think Disney will have many visitors. It just won’t be Disney."
"Now to me, except for the higher prices (their prices are already obscene), I’m ok with it. Reduced crowds through limited capacity? Awesome! Shows? I’ll kind of miss them but not that much. I’m more into rides than crowding around for the shows. I always have FOMO when I’m waiting to watch a show and could be riding. And I stress about getting a “good” spot because I’m short. And if I have rude, pushy people around me or talk through the good parts then it sucks my enjoyment. You never know what you’ll get. Now, I’m not a foreign guest who has days upon days to explore the parks and not have to worry about how to do it all in a limited time. If I had 4 days at MK I’d be so bored that I’d surely want to watch shows and parades. When you have 1 day though, you skip stuff. Lower crowds would greatly improve things so I see an upside."
"For me that would impact magic kingdom the most. The rest, universal sea world etc the only issues would be the quei g and restaurants."
I would think they could figure out how to social distance during a live show. Like sit in pods or something. But then I guess the performers are not social distancing. Interesting to think about.
"Disney is a business and they have to do what they have to do. Obviously to appease the frightened they have to find a way of keeping people separated. The days of fire codes being what was their only limiting factor for how many they can pack in are over. They have to find a way to operate under the new silly rules if they want to operate or they can simply close up and put a for sale sign in the front yard. The bad is it won't be the same, but the good as Beth pointed out is that you may actually be able to enjoy yourself and not be elbow to elbow as it has recently evolved. Price has to go up. They have bills to pay and share holders to appease. It is up to the public to decide if we want to pay for it."
"If there were no parades I would seriously consider NOT going. I already despise the fact that they got rid of all the parades in the other parks besides MK in favor of the stupid ""dance parties""when I remember being a kid and watching ""The wonderful world of Disney"" on TV the memory that sticks out the most and is seeing the Electrical Parade, I had to wait almost 25 years before I could see it in person.The Disney parks will NOT be the same without Parades and shows. And honestly what is the difference between standing next to someone watching a parade and standing next to the same person while waiting in line for a ride or eating food?"
"I just go for the rides, the parades and shows are of no interest to me at all. If this means less people in the park and shorter lines for the rides, I am all for it.Edited: 5:53 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"This is all speculation at this point, as you know. Most of these ""Disney sites"" are fueled by rumors, not facts. With that being said, I would be willing to pay more if it meant lower crowds and not having to be stacked on top of people in 95% humidity and 100 degrees. Honestly, I couldn't care less about the shows, but I WOULD miss fireworks. There is something magical about ending your night at the MK with that. I also don't give a hoot if someone wants to take my temperature. If I'm not feeling well I probably don't want to be spending my day at a theme park anyway!"
I could live with this.
"The parades and shows are not my thing. I go for the rides and the general experience. Yes, things will have to change. People will still have the choice of accepting the change and going or wistfully remembering the good old days and not going.Edited: 6:29 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"I agree with your thinking Mike re special offers.We visited New York a few weeks after 9/11 as the prices were so good and we got to stay at the Hilton in one of their top rooms for next to nothing. I am really hoping that with regards to overseas visitors, especially UK, Disney give us free dining at the very least to try and get us back but according to all the Disney sites they do not think that is likely. It really is a wait and see game at the moment but I am still planning on choosing fast passes in July ready for Sept and just keeping everything crossed it works out."
"What I'm hearing is that there will be a soft opening at first for true locals--Orange, Osceola, Lake, Polk, and Seminole County residents with valid State issued ID. One reason for this is that they don't need to have the hotels open for these guests, and they can closely work with the DOH to determine if any new cases can be traced back to Disney should they occur.If there are no problems they will then open to Florida residents. Florida DL or other FL state issued ID will be required for admission. Only if there are no new cases after a few weeks of operating like this will the reopen to others.They will be scanning people with infrared thermometers and anyone with a fever will be denied entry."
"Assuming some or all of this is correct (nobody knows), there will undoubtedly be a need to increase price if the capacity is going to be limited. If there would be a limited number of people in an individual park, and you could actually go on more than three rides and gasp- actually be able to enjoy the parks, that might not be a bad thing.The firework thing would probably suck. The parade thing is 50/50. Parades are great, but having to scramble six billion hours in advance to find a seat or a spot isn't.A few years ago, I had a hell of a time just trying to cross over to get a beverage and use the restroom at the Universal Mardi Gras parade. Everybody was so paranoid about their spot, they wouldn't let anybody through. How to limit the crowds at the Food and Wine will be interesting."
"About pricing, Disney has been raising prices almost annually for years and the parks have remained packed. It’s the old supply & demand at work. Do you think their costs have gone up the same? I bet they will start with discounted pricing to see what the demand will be they will also probably start out with reduced staff so overhead should be lower. Once they get a handle on demand I’d expect them to raise prices again slowly to see what the market will bear."
"Just my personal opinion....Unlike many other holidays, a trip to Disney is going to happen, especially if you have children and have told them that they’re going. The first challenge will be to get through all the people who had their trips cancelled. That will likely see demand as high with limited capacity for a while so yes, I agree that prices will rise in the short term.After that, which may well be next year, it will depend on the supply of a vaccine for places like Disney to operate at full capacity. Until then, expect a range of measures to avoid crowds everywhere worldwide.Now, the economy. No one yet knows what the medium or long term impact will be on the worlds economies. It’s just to early to say. Once the worlds governments stop supplying money to Businesses and people, then we’ll find out the real impact to people’s jobs.And that’s when we’ll find the true demand for places like Disney, which will ultimately decide supply prices. Only a guess, but I’m expecting high prices until next March (While they clear the backlog of rebooking under reduced capacity) then some great deals for next Spring and Summer. 2021.Beyond that, my crystal ball goes all cloudy.Stay safe people."
"Mike is right when they fully open, by that I mean they do not have to restrict numbers and can have parades and shows etc, demand will be down and therefore prices will go down.Basic rule of economics is lower demand = lower price. Lots of pet hat would go will be financially out of the picture. Then there’s those disinclined due to fear of the decease. Plus overseas travellers cannot get travel insurance to cover Covid19 and there is a reduction in demand. Would I want to go without parades,shows and Fireworks NO WAY. It is all part of what makes a Disney trip."
"Yes Mike has made a good comment, we all hope there are decent deals next year with DisneyIf so, we will be booking, but only if the total price falls within our budgetBut the price isn't the only factor, none of us know what state the USA will be in, the virus has hit the USA very hard and the heads of government aren't taking the medical experts advice as seriously as they should. Their lockdown could be softened very shortly which could make matters much worsewe will wait before paying out, if too high then its a 'No', the world is a big place with many beauty spots all over, also these nations might not be as effected as badly as the USA because they are better runbut Disney would still be our 1st choice if things work out well"
"People on Twitter are posting pics of Disney reservations for later in the summer that now say online checkin is required, go straight to your room after check in. If true sounds like trying to reduce traffic at front desk."
Disney is already doing a Florida resident ticket deal for $175 for three days and you can roll that over into an AP.Hotel rates are still pretty high.That would be nice to open to Floridians only at first.
"""Disney is already doing a Florida resident ticket deal for $175 for three days and you can roll that over into an AP.""Considering that the cost is like $120 a day."
"@jordanbulls, how are you getting $120 per day?It's $58 per day for the three day and $49 per day for the four day."
Here’s the Orlando Sentinel take on changes for theme parks. Yes I am aware this is all speculation. https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/…Not sure if there is a paywall.
"Octoberitaly..People in European countries can't open your link I'm afraid....at least, that's the message I got when I tried."
"I guess there is a paywall. Sorry but I decided to buy a subscription for a few months. I think it was just a few dollarsSummary Social distancing, likely reduce capacity to allow this, servers wear masks, redo lines to allow social distance, look into virtual queues again with reduced capacity, lots of signs stating when things were last cleaned, change out some things form 3D to 2d so the glasses are not needed. They did mention that the glasses are cleaned anyway, always have been. Then they had a little blurb from the author of the Brits guide to Disney who basically said that people from the UK are hoping to travel again to Orlando. She said 90% say they want to travel. Obviously that is biased."
