"Hi. We are in our late 30's. Wondering is the airport having tight temp screening upon arrival? We are due to arrive in less then 2 weeks. Wondering how's everyone in NL doing. Are there lesser tourist recently? Earlier we made plans to travel to utretch, rotterdam, the hague -guess will scrape this plan off and hangout around amsterdam. Still love to go to zaadam and lissie.. the main reason for this trip. Hope to get some insights about what's happening now in NL. Let me know. Thanks."
There's no screening. Visitor numbers are only down slightly at this moment.
And why on earth would you not go to Utrecht and Rotterdam?Check the other corona virus post... Especially post #9: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18859…
"Lionheart, just a thought. I read that more covid cases around that area. Still not able to make up the mind should we proceed with this trip or to have it cancelled."
"Flowerymae, I am leaving for Berlin March 17. From Berlin to Amsterdam March 21. Have been keeping up to date on this virus. For me, I would still go. Netherlands, as of today, has 128 cases. Malaysia has 93. So really, your exposure to unknown cases is not much different.Quite different if you are planning to go to Italy..."
At the moment of our 17 million inhabitants 0.0011% are infected. Infections are currently mostly occuring in Noord Brabant province.I travel throughout the country every day for work. Based on the mass hysteria stirred up by the media I should've contracted it at least 5 times... Reality of the situationhere is that chances are a lot higher to get infected as a local rather than a tourist.
"Biggawao, yes Malaysia is catching up with the numbers but the area I'm in is still covid free. Most covid cases comes from the main city of Malaysia. You are giving me some hope now. I will be in Ams around the same time as you too. Wonder are all the places of interest and eateries still functioning as normal."
"Lionheart, i did think the way you did not. This covid is much an amplified news. The thing is the news is causing the world to panic and of course the extra screening at airport.. makes me more nervous. Just wondering if the tourist spots are still operating as normal? I hope they are not closed. I do know Japan has shutdown most of their famous tourist spots. I don't hope it would happen to me for this trip. I was really looking forward to many unique foods and sightseeing spots."
"""Wonder are all the places of interest and eateries still functioning as normal.""At this moment EVERYTHING in Amsterdam is functioning the way it was before covid-19. If you don't turn on the local news you'd never know covid was here, well except for the dozens of people per day collapsing in the street and being taken away by Men In Black wearing hazmat suits and entering and leaving the infected areas via telemetric portals."
The latest update just showed an additonal 60 to the prev 128 making a total of 188 now in the NL. Be safe all.
"I live in the province of Noord-Brabant that has the most corona virus patients. I was at the theatre last night to see a play. Today a friend and I took the train to a train station in the eastern part of our province and we then walked to a village in the middle of our province. Before we took the train back to Breda, we had a few beers in a cafe on the town square. After we returned to Breda I went to the supermarket. Everywhere I went, I saw people going around their every day life as usual. No one was wearing face masks, the theatre was full, the trains were full, there were lots of people in the restaurants and cafes, no one was panic buying in the supermarket. Toilet paper, pasta, canned food etc were still in stock.No one can predict what the situation will be like tomorrow, but right now everything is business as usual."
"Flowermae, I live in Kyōto, Japan and our biggest or most famous tourist spots are temples, shrines and gardens. “Japan” did NOT close these places as of today. Our everyday life is mostly normal at the moment here. Trains are still crowded but not super packed because so many tourists have cancelled their trips. I’ve been out shopping and have gone to cafes & bars this weekend and people are still around and going out. People did panic buy all of the toilet paper and other paper products but it’ll be on the shelves again soon. I just wanted to set the record straight based on what you said above. Large events have been cancelled and most busy museums are closed. Disneyland and Universal Studios Japan are also closed if you consider them the most important attractions in Japan.All schools in Japan are NOT closed either. Even though it’s being reported that way in the media."
"Kobekeith, thank you for clearing up the air. The media has exaggerated all these news. It was good that all Japs are still carrying on life in a positive way. I love Japanese culture and the food! Stay well snd take care."
"Flowerymae, no worries! I wanted you to know the truth at this moment (Sunday morning) because you were maybe basing your decision to cancel Amsterdam partially on Japan being shut down but it’s just not true right now. Many places that are closed wouldn’t really bother tourists. Like libraries and community centers. I’m still booked for my trip to Amsterdam on the 15th and wondering what to do so I’m watching this forum. My friends in Utrecht tell me it’s all media hype right now and i should still come. I’ll decide at the last minute probably. Good luck!"
"Kobekeith, i am still doing the wait and see. Whether is the media hype or not, some risk are just not worth taking if we know what the outcome would be. Lets wait and see. Let me know if you have decided to go on with your trip. Good luck!"
Yup ... same here. Wait and see. Not sure if it’s worth it if people are thinking I’m going to give them corona. And friends here are saying “just don’t tell anyone where you’re from.” So I’ll have to lie about my job and where I’m from... I guess I could invent a cool back story and try that out on people during my 3-week trip ? I’ll let you know!
"kobekeith, just bring your neuralyzer. I found that helps immensely :-))"
"We are traveling to Amsterdam next week, and the comments on this post are very encouraging! We absolutely do not want to change our plans- but are sensitive to the local level of concern.Edited: 9:35 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Alex, we are all doing the wait and see. As much as we do not want to cancel our trip but the numbers of infection increasing daily is worrying me. My trip is due on the 17. I still have a few more days to monitor the situation. Will see. Wish you luck!"
"Same situation for me. Wait and see. My partner says he doesn’t want to go anymore so looks like this might be a trip I take by myself, if I do decide to go. March 20 is my date to leave US. Been reading post from locals and it’s easing my concern alot. Now I may need travel friends... lol"
"@ #20 - I don’t know if you have Cedar Fever in Plano like we do in Austin, but if you do, that is comparable to the symptoms of COVID-19. If you are extremely immunocompromised then you’re at a higher risk but you’re at risk for any communicable disease. The irrational fear response from this is by far more dangerous than the actual virus."
"Krista D, yes, we have cedar fever bad here in North Texas! I am not immunocompromised but during spring I get seasonal allergies not severe. I just take Zyrtec and I am fine."
“ My concern is that they might close the museums just like what the Louvre did for a time.”The Louvre did not close voluntarily or because of a government decision. The Louvre had to close because the employees refused to work in what they believed to be an unsafe work environment.
"Thanks BTG. Rijks, Anne Franks, and Van Gogh! Here I come!"
"“ Thanks BTG. Rijks, Anne Franks, and Van Gogh! Here I come!”Here you come?? In post #21 of this thread https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18859… you literally said; “I personally would avoid big crowds. Just as a precaution. Especially stationary crowds (as in a theater, concert, etc.)“ The Anne Frank house especially is just 1 big stationary crowd that moves thru the museum at a very slow pace. The Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum are slightly less packed, but you will still get very up close and personal to your fellow visitors. So why would you visit these museums when you want to avoid big stationary crowds?"
"Those crowds are moving and I can move away if someone is sneezing or coughing. .. Unlike in a movie house, or in a plane (unavoidable). :-))"
"“ Those crowds are moving and I can move away if someone is sneezing or coughing.”I take it you’ve never been to the Anne Frank house. The Annex where the Frank family tried to hide from the Nazi’s is small. You basically walk thru it in a single file. There will be people right before you and right after you. There is no moving away.The Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum are slightly less crowded, but you still can’t move away suddenly when someone near you sneezes. You will bump into someone else if you do. See this photo of the crowds in the Rijksmuseum to understand what I mean; https:/…16221192871Edited: 12:50 pm, March 09, 2020 "
By the time you get here the museums might be as quiet as we haven't seen them in 10 years.
"Btg if I have been there, I won't be going back to Anne franks. This is my first time and I have to pick and choose re. exposure to crowds vs my need to see these iconic places. Or the last poster could be right. And these places could be so much less crowded that I don't feel I need my mask anymore. Seems like you wanna discourage me from visiting AMS. If I can cancel my tickets and acccomodation, I would stay in Berlin. They may have e more cases and maybe the cause of the Italy outbreak but at least no one there have needled my plans. Have a nice day"
"I don’t want to discourage you from visiting Amsterdam. I’m just trying to point out that your statement that you will avoid crowds doesn’t correspond with what you are actually planning to do. You will still fly to Berlin and are even planning to take a 6.5 hour long train ride from Berlin to Amsterdam instead of a short 1 hour long flight. Trains are just as crowded as planes, so I would think the shorter you’re in one, the better. And when you’re in Amsterdam you plan to visit the top 3 most visited museums. That’s not avoiding crowds, that’s looking them up.I’m all for tourists continuing to come to Amsterdam, but I just don’t understand your reasoning.Edited: 1:53 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"last post to you. It's not black and white. As much as possible I will avoid crowds. If I can't then I take precautions. Even our cdc says that. Avoid crowds as much as possible. If I need to avoid crowds AT ALL I should stay home and not even work. I work in a hospital.I was thinking to drop by the market near Heineken Experience. This I can drop.The train I had already booked and it was logistically better for me. If you must know, I have bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees. So I want to avoid going to the airport in the wee hours of the morning. Bye.Edited: 2:36 pm, March 09, 2020 "
@bogwawo yes I'd stay in Berlin this type of comments you've endured are pointless as you say 'needling'. I'd steer clear of amsterdam mind your knees and your sanity from these types of locals. Enjoy your trip.
"Just a quick update.. i may cancel my upcoming trip to ams. Having thought over, is not worth going for now as we may expect some crowded place (which i would avoid) and may also run to a few museums that might be closed last min. Anyway wait and see for the last day before i make any further decision. If the numbers keep goint up by 50, it would hit more than 700 cases within a week."
I think you're right to postpone flowery mae as btg mentioned alot of places are very tight like not going to the Anne Frank House would be a great loss but to catch the virus would be awful. Better safe than sorry.
"@Flowerymae; yes the number of cases is still going up, but most of these cases are in the south of the Netherlands. So far there are only a few patients in Amsterdam. It’s still your decision to make of course, but you might want to take this into consideration."
"To be exact; there are currently 4 confirmed cases in Amsterdam. 4 cases on a total of more than 860.000 inhabitants. To compare this to some cities in the south of the Netherlands; the city of Breda, where I live, has 19 confirmed cases on a total of just over 180.000 inhabitants. Tilburg 27 confirmed cases and 217.000 inhabitants."
"Flowermae in my opinion you did the right decision to not risk traveling at the time when there is exponential rise in virus cases. You should evaluate own risk reward first and forget the rest.In January it was only a case in Wuhan and RIVM and others in Netherlands actually officially said that it would never get here as there is no direct flight.Some days back it was only in Italy and only people who were traveling to Italy had the risk.Now when Italy has SHUT ITSELF down and reached nearly 10,000 cases, the story will shift to something else until it will be even more in your face.The world leaders have not all gone mad at the same time. Italy has not shut itself for fun. President Trump is not suddenly thinking of cutting taxes for fun. Boris Johnson yesterday said that they WILL NOT BE ABLE TO contain the virus spread. Champions League matches this week will be played in empty stadiums. Soon they might even be cancelled for good. The Olympics are in danger of cancellation.Qantas has cancelled 25% of their flights. Virgin Air said that most of their planes are flying empty and they can't afford for a long period.So it is no longer a laughing matter.For you, and everyone here, taking a risk based on somewhat unqualified opinions of strangers, is not wise !Read qualified advice from qualified people.https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/coronavirushttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-d…Edited: 2:36 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I wish here we could have had slightly better quality discussion, such as those on TA Rome forum etc. could manage during the last several days of the virus spreading.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18779…I wish the people of Italy good luck and hope they can soon contain it, and be back in business much healthier."
"Hi i am from KLI have upcoming trip end of march to london, amsterdam, germany and austria.Contemplating to go . As u know, malaysian media, news and perception are giving me the creeps.what is is your precaution plan in europe?"
"Shandoz, KK, thanks for your opinions. We have decided to postpone it till fall 2020. We hope by then the air will be cleared without virus. It was a tough decision to make because it has incurred quite a sum of money to change the ticket and accommodations yet you are right.. think of self first then others. We don't want to be irresponsible people to cause pain to others. We have social responsibilities to reduce the risk of contracting the virus and protecting our family and others. I hope those who still insist on their trip to think about others.. if not pls ensure you go back home safely without contracting the virus. I will pray for NL and the wonderful people here in this forum to be safe. Thanks all for your valuable information.. i will be seeing you Amsterdam.. soon! Wait for me.Cheers people!"
Also thanks BTG for your valuable explanations. I missed you out in my earlier post. Thanks everyone. Stay safe!
"You're welcome flowermae I'm currently in a predicament re a trip to Poland, Russia and Lithuania in May I'll leave the decision until a little closer in the hope things change and its refundable etc but I'm truly sorry you've had to cancel but I also admire your dignity in doing so it's respectful to both yourself and others, amsterdam is not going to disappear let's all curtail trips until the pandemic does... Still I empathise with you."
I’m still going as of right now. KLM hasn’t cancelled flights so I’m still planning on leaving this weekend. I was able to speak to KLM representatives on the phone after about a 70-minute wait and they said my flight next week from Amsterdam to Boston is not cancelled even though it sounded like that in the media. My Osaka to Amsterdam flight this weekend is also good to go. So no refunds if I cancel both trips.
"Yeah i received an email of refund for my anne frank tickets. I guess many other places of interest will be closed too. Praying for NL. Kobekeith, wish you a safe journey. Take extra care okay?"
"Flowerymae, you received an email from Anne Franks House? On their website it said do not contact them. Then they reassured us that all affected will be refunded. At least they have the decency to email you.. I will wait for my email!"
"Flowerymae, thanks for that. I ended up canceling my flight the day before. I was able to get a refund on one flight and only a credit voucher for my other flight. Both on KLM. My Airbnb was 100% refunded and the owners were very kind about it. I’m a bit shocked that the hotel I had booked on Booking.com kept the entire amount. Thieves. Oh well. I have the next 3.5 weeks off. I’ll find a way to make things right with them. :)"
"Kobekeith, great move! You did te right thing. 3.5 weeks free and easy for ya. Stay home? Hehe.. booking.com was never genuine. Try to see how you can squeeze them. At least they can be gracious to allow half refund or what not. Very bad. My lesson learnt, book hotels with free cancellation or pay later. Biggawao, wait for their email. They were kind to send me an email about the refund. I will be checking my credit card statement for the money. I believe it will take sometime. Anyway I'm all free waiting."
"Flowerymae, thank you. Yes. 3.5 weeks at home I am starting to realize now that it has started. Kyōto not really a bad place to be “stuck” I guess. Cherry blossoms will start soon. I’m pretty sure it’s not booking .com that is the problem here. They say it’s up to the owner of the place and they are the liars and thieves at this point. My check in date was the 16th. They were put on lockdown on the 15th. My Japanese credit card company is going to investigate the charges. Hopefully they will get them to act like normal human beings. Although maybe that is acting like normal human beings? Taking advantage of others during a crisis and profiting?!Edited: 4:52 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Cherry trees are in full blossom in Amsterdam, it's a spectacular sight right now in several parks."
"Kobekeith, is not very ethical for these home owners to take adv of us especially during this crisis. I hope you do get back your money, really. Meantime enjoy Kyoto. I been to Kyoto twice but never got the chance to see the cherry blossoms.I love the people, the culture and the foods!! If i do Kyoto again, I'll remember to drop u a msg. :) and i make sure i will get to there during spring time."
"I agree, it’s not ethical at all, thank you. We’re actually having beautiful weather here lately in Kyōto and the full sakura bloom should be 12 days early this year so at least that’s something to look forward to. Some trees yesterday were already blooming. I just want to be finished with Booking .com and KLM! It shouldn’t take several days. Airbnb was only 2 minutes to cancel for a full refund!? Humans with brains and souls must work there."
"Hope everyone in the Netherlands are coping fine. Lockdowns are at most countries and thankfully i had Singapore airlines to refund my tixs. Kobekeith, i hope you got your refunds too!"
"Thanks FloweryMae, I thought i had one of 2 refunds set from KLM until a few days ago but they changed their minds apparently and my 4 flights that were cancelled are now not refundable. I guess they’re desperate for money so they need to take it from loyal customers as airlines from around the world refunded flights for March. Things are different in the Netherlands. :("
"Kobekeith, KLM did not give you flight credits or to reschedule to a later date? I believe things are not going so well for all countries. Foreseeing no travels until a year later. The virus is a super stubborn one."
