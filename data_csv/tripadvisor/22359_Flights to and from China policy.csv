What is the current policy for flights to and from China in Vietnam please? Is it still totally restricted?
No update must mean Yes..... https:/… I see flights between S Korea to Vietnam are also suspended now https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/places/s…
As far as I know no flights in or out. Other flights are also being suspended between South Korea and Singapore. This is airlines doing it not the govt yet.
