No travel to Europe says Trump tonight
Very disappointing news all around.

"This is a question for Tripadvisor. For those of us who cannot travel due to a govt advisory [CDC and State Dept in the US], can you help us with cancellations in terms of owners loosening cancellation fees? For others, re US travel ban from Europe to the US--there have been ""clarifications"" about what Trump meant when he announced the travel ban. As the previous poster pointed out, the ban applies to foreign nationals from [most of] Europe. [the UK is exempted, for example, having nothing to do with Brexit.]It does not apply to US citizens and permanent residents. I also agree there is a logistical problem in terms of airlines offering flights from Europe to the US--for non-Europeans only?"

"penrith1 until the government formerly give the go ahead, which could be any day soon, it is widely believed that to lift the lockdown now or at least when present one ends next week would be folly.

While most companies have been good about refunding the paid amounts, I am having a hard time with these 2:1. Ticketmaster: I had booked tickets for the Real Madrid match on April 12. Ticketmaster is saying they will not be able to issue refund until the National and European Football Association make a decision on refunds. I did not see anything in the news. Any update is much appreciated.2. Vueling: My flight from Barcelona was cancelled. Vueling says I can use the amount paid till December this year for a trip up to June 2021. However with travel remaining uncertain, I would like a refund. I called up their US phone line and it is impossible to reach a human being. The line cuts off when you choose that option. Has anybody had luck in getting a refund from Vueling?Many thanks.RegardsLaks"

My understanding from a friend living in Madrid is that the border will be closed to tourists until at least October. Does anyone have a government source for that information? We are wondering if that's set in stone already. Can anyone advise? I don't speak Spanish, so I was hoping to find a site that had an English language translation option.Thanks for any help you can provide.

"#54 Sorry, it seems the Tourism Minister was contradicted by the Interior Minister. I asked TA to remove this post."
"The current news carried by the ""state"" radio/tv service RTVE is that, after a morning of confusion with different departments of the central government in Madrid contradicting each other, the plan now is for the 2 main Spanish land borders, with France and with Portugal, to be open for tourists on 1st July.The issue of possible earlier openings for tourist flights to some of the Spanish islands remains unclear, however.(The other 2 land borders with Andorra and with Gibraltar have not been mentioned yet in these reports.)"
"Could anyone direct me to a government website that details the latest travel restrictions? Everything I seem to find doesn't outline who is/isn't allowed to travel. All I've been able to find is ""Effective May 15 through June 30, passengers arriving in Spain from other countries will be required to quarantine at their home/place of accommodation for the 14 days immediately following their arrival"" I'm having to show proof of restrictions to cancel an AirBnB stay in July (traveling from the US). From what I've read in the news. it sounds like Spain will not be allowing visitors from the US by then. Or is it a waiting game for the next set of restrictions to be announced?"
"The official date for reopening Spanish borders to foreign travelers is July 1, when it will also lift its requirement for a 14-day quarantinehttps://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020…"
"Hello all! Any idea when Spain is opening up for airline entry from the USA? The information online seems to indicate that travel into Spain via land borders will happen on July 1st, but no mention of access via international flights. Any information is greatly appreciated! Richard"
"Revulgo and everyone else, everything I've seen posted from the Spanish government indicates that international travel resumes for all countries on the 1st, and that the quarantine will be abolished. Are there more details forthcoming, or does it appear that Americans will be able to enter in July?"
"Thanks for all of the helpful info! My next question, for residents of Spain, is: will we be welcomed or unwanted as tourists? I hate to travel all the way to Spain only to find no one wants us there or we are making people feel nervous.Can anyone advise on the general feeling about allowing tourists? Also, should we assume that our hotels will be up and running since we haven't heard anything different, or do we need to reach out to all of them and make sure that everything is still good? I'm just wondering what everyone else is doing.We are still on the fence about the whole thing at this point...Thanks so much!"
"kievalina. Spain does want business activity to start again especially during the traditional hot holiday months of July and August. Tourists are of course generating much income for Spain and they miss visitors. As a frequent visitor to Spain I personally am quite nervous about the country having a second ""spike"" or wave of infections mainly brought about by the more relaxed open society that one sees in the summer. And again as a visitor it really depends on how you personally feel about the ""new normal"" and how it can affect your vacation. Think this terrible disease affects people in different ways so as an over 70s person I may be more concerned about exposing myself to danger. Whereas a teenager may not be as worried."
"Latest news (June 14th):* Spain will reopen borders to European Union states on June 21.* From June 21, EU travelers arriving in the country will no longer be required to stay in quarantine for two weeks.* Travelers from non-EU countries will be permitted to enter from July 1, providing there is a reciprocal agreement on travel and taking into account the epidemiological situation in the country of origin.https://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020…* Here’s how the coronavirus deescalation plan will endhttps://english.elpais.com/society/2020-06-1…Edited: 1:48 pm, June 14, 2020 "
"Please note that:* Tourists from the EU and the Schengen free-travel area – including the United Kingdom – will officially be allowed from June 21, with the exception of Portugal. And on July 1, other international travelers will be allowed to enter Spain as part of the EU’s coordinated move to lift travel restrictions. But this will be contingent on a reciprocal agreement and taking into account the epidemiological situation in the countries of origin, among other factors.* The United Kingdom is still considered an EU member state given that it is in a transition period and enjoys full membership rights, “this does not mean that there may not be another change if the epidemiological situation in Britain requires this.”* From July 1st, travelers will also have to complete a Passenger Location Card (PLC), which they must fill in with information about any coronavirus symptoms they might have, and their contact address during their stay in Spain. These forms, which are currently handed out, will be computerized to make the process faster and avoid large gatherings in airports. Similar measures have been included in the tourism scheme in the Balearic Islands.* From July 1, Spain’s airports will screen for potential coronavirus cases using thermal-imaging cameras, which can check the body temperature of several people simultaneously, an improvement from doing it one at a time with a thermometer pointed at a person’s forehead.* Informational posters have been placed in key areas of airports, and hand sanitizer dispensers, floor markers to indicate safe distances and protective screens have also been introduced. What’s more, reminders to wear face masks and keep apart from other travelers are emitted every five minutes over the airport loudspeakers."
"Spanis Health Minister said that after Sunday, visitors entering Spain will have to undergo three types of controls: a written health declaration, a temperature check, and a visual screening. If travelers fail any of these tests, a physician will examine them and send them to the healthcare services of the region where they are going to spend their stay in Spain. In order to make these procedures smoother, airports are incorporating thermal imaging and digital declarations.https://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020…"

Can I travel to Spain from NYC as a UK citizen?
"I would doubt it's the nationality that counts, more the residency. Wait and see if Spain opens its borders to the USA."
"European borders are reopening, but there is a lot of small print to digestCitizens from the United Kingdom, which has officially left the EU but is still covered by a transition agreement until December that grants it full rights as a member state, can enter Spain. But anyone taking the opposite journey will have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival in the UK, a measure that will be in place at least until June 29, despite Spain having opted not to impose a reciprocal measure on UK arrivals.Denmark will keep border controls in place for the majority of its fellow members – including Spain – until June 27.The rules for non-EU and non-Schengen countries are yet to be defined at all. Spain is counting on the 27-member bloc to agree on a list of safe countries, with scaled entry dates according to the epidemiological situation in each one.Washington is still vetoing the entrance of Europeans on American soil, which is prompting the EU to respond in kind.https://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020…"
"Aragon goes back to phase 2. The Government of Aragon has announced this Monday that the Huesca districts of La Litera, Cinca Medio and Bajo Cinca are receding to phase 2 of de-escalation as a result of a resurgence of COVID-19 in the agricultural environment. This change will cause limitations to be re-established in these territories, such as a 50% capacity in the hospitality industry, a ban on the use of bar bars or a maximum occupancy of one third of the capacity of swimming pools. In addition, the Minister of Health, Sira Repollés, has recommended at a press conference to residents of the three regions to limit their movements abroad, as well as the rest of the population to avoid visiting the area."

"I just want to say thank you for all of your help. I'm saddened to say that we have had to cancel our trip (flights were cancelled by the airline), but knowing that Spain and Portugal are doing a better job of handling this crisis than the U.S. is, I'm trying to tell myself it's the right thing to do, anyway. Our group is from Michigan and New York, the only two states currently doing ""well"", but I know that even that is relative to the rest of the U.S., and that we are still not doing as well as you guys are at controlling this thing. I know that not having tourists from the U.S. will be an economic hardship for some, but I also know that this illness is not to be taken lightly, and I do think this ban is maybe for the best. If anything, Europe should be banning us because of our inability to deal with Covid19, but the result will hopefully be the same in terms of lives saved. I look forward to a time when we'll be able to visit. Everyone we have dealt with (with the exception of Ryanair-- I have NOTHING good to say about them!) has been nothing but understanding, polite, and kind, and it makes me even more determined to visit when it's safe to do so.Wishing you all the best. Take care, stay safe, and I hope you are all able to weather this. Again, thank you!"
