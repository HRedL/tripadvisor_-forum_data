Can anyone tell me the current situation at the Rui vistamar concerning stomach illness/bug?
Why don’t you drop the hotel an email?
Have only read about one person allegedly getting food poisoning - hardly an epidemic unless I have missed something?
It was just the review that said people were being sick all round the hotel that had me concerned.
Best to contact the hotel or your rep if you booked with anyone.
"There are at least 3 reviews mentioning this in the last 2 weeks, with a particularly graphic report from BlondeBlueEyes, describing people being ill all over the hotel.Unfortunately all inclusive hotels are particularly prone to such things as you've got a large number of people staying onsite 24 hours a day, all touching the same things over and over again, rather than going off complex.Beachlover, in your case I would contact whoever you booked with. If you are travelling in the next couple of weeks, I understand your concerns. If you are travelling in a month or more, hopefully it will have resolved itself by then."
Thanks!
"Not here too. It seems to be in. Benidorm too. I’m wondering if it’s noro virus spreading from the airplanes. The hotel we stayed in Benidorm although we were fine, seems to have had its fair share too. It’s poor hygiene with holidaymakers."
"Another review gone on today. Hope you are not going there too soon beachlovermerseyside, sounds a nightmare. Such a pity because we found the food to be excellent and have never had better at any other hotel we have been to."
Can someone point me in the direction of this thread about the sickness?
Don't think there is a thread it is being mentioned in the recent reviews for the hotel
Thank you. We arrive tomorrow thankfully not staying at the Vistamar! Hopefully it’s just within the hotel not a problem within the whole island.....
Have you ever heard of an entire island being struck down with Norovirus? No. It’ll be hotel based only and will only last a week or so. No need to worry. People are dirty and unhygienic and these things happen.
"This stomach bug is everywhere! 4 members of our family has had it recently here in England. So its not always the fault of the hotels. Basic hand washing does help keep it at bay. Also I think restaurant staff should make more of an effort to push the anti-bacteria hand gel, there was hand rub in our hotel restaurant but didn't see anyone use it, apart from us!!."
"I expect the insurance claims will be flooding in soon.I am sure we have all seen people behaving badly. I reckon , based on personal experience and published surveys, that half to two thirds of people don't wash their hands properly on leaving the loo. I have seen on a cruise ship men leaving the loo and walking past a staff member pleading with people to use sanitisers.Keep your own personal hygiene and everyone in your group too , immaculate and watch what you do at the food counter. e.g. use a spoon and fork like a waiter rather than tongs and you will stand a good chance of avoiding the ill behaved's consequences."
