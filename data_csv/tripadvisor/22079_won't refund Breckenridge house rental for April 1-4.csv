With stay-at-home orders from a nationwide pandemic upon us we cancelled our rental home vacation March 31-April 4 The owner won't refund us because we cancelled within 30 days (14 days instead of 30) -it is in the contract but STILL - who does that !! He did give us back cleaning fee and refundable deposit but not the nightly fee because he said he doesn't have to...... Is anyone else not getting refunded?
"Guess that's why they have you sign a ""contract"". It's either you or him that is out the money.Government doesn't bail them out."
"Welcome to the Colorado forums. You'll likely find a variety of reactions from businesses as to how they manage. Was this direct-to-owner or through a booking service such as Airbnb, etc. This is also where travel insurance becomes a good deal if you chose to acquire it in advance. Did you pay with credit card, which may provide you some relief depending on the terms.Good luck. Stay safe."
"You did not say how you booked this vacation rental. Here are the policies for coronavirus from VRBO and Airbnb. Even if you did not book through either of these, their policies would be examples of what you could expect.https://help.vrbo.com/articles/What-can-I-do…https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2701/ext…"

"Good find, Tex. Very good explaination.As VRBO, we have already had 5 cancellations with many more to come.Fortunately for us, this is our main residence. For some, this is their livelihood.If any of you travelers put there have a short term rental in the hopper for this summer, please check your contract. It is up to you to initiate the cancellation. We may be in this a lot longer than we imagined"
