"This just announcedhttps://www.wantedinrome.com/news/italy-clos…The entire Countries Museums, Cinemas, Theatres are being shut down to stop the spread of the Corona 19 virus"
Sad....but it now seems some things are reopening. Hope so.Ps--is it true china sold back to italy the medical supplies that italy donated earlier?? Wow.
the whole country should have been on total lockdown over 2 months ago the same thing that China did.
"holachica1Unless you are based **in** China - it is problematic to say Italy needed to do the ""same thing"" that China did. News is heavily filtered out of China - western journalists have been kicked out of the country for publishing headlines that the government disagrees with.There are many journalists and government intelligence employees that think China drastically under-reported the number of deaths and the number of people infected with the COVID-19 virus."

holachica1China does not have a vaccine. You need to stop reading your news on Twitter and Facebook.
"Drew, I don't have a Twitter or Facebook, Instagram or others, I said was all clear to me when I saw the youtube video and news reports on wuhan the only news broadcast I watch is BBC world news."
holachica1:I frequently listen to BBC radio and they have reported nothing of the sort. Are you sure you are looking at the official BBC News feed on Youtube or a fake account?
"Drew I said i only watched footage on youtube and TV, the BBC said nothing of the sort what I'm saying on the above post I'm saying I came to my own conclusion when I saw live footage of president in china walking in Wuhan 3 weeks ago with a dust mask on only.Edited: 1:49 am, April 09, 2020 "
He could have been walking anywhere. The Chinese media say whatever the Party tells them.
"the president of china id be in a bio-suit and gas mask in Wuhan 3 weeks ago on so you're saying its fake news it was all staged on a film a set? ^^^^Edited: 10:59 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"holachica1:Using your same logic, I guess you think the UK has a vaccine, too? A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson went to a hospital and visited COVID-19 patients and shook hands with doctors, nurses and the COVID-19 patients."

>>so you're saying its fake news it was all staged on a film a set?<<I am saying it could have been filmed in any Chinese city at any time in the past few years. Please stop the silly conspiracy theories.
"""but it now seems some things are reopening""The only thing that is reopening in Italy at present is the debate on when things are going to reopen. I’ve only skimmed through the headlines of the newspapers this morning but one I saw said that scientists were putting the brakes on Conte’s plans to permit certain key industries to re-start next month, and it would surely be safe to say that when non-industrial operations do recommence, it will be on a very gradual basis and prioritized. I could be wrong, but I wouldn't have thought that museums, cinemas or theatres are a priority for anyone, and even if social distancing was introduced in the latter two, I'm not sure anyone I know, myself included, would be rushing to buy a ticket anytime soon.BTW, as a Brit, I'm chuffed to read that Drew in the US follows the BBC for news, the ""Beeb"" being one of the country's most precious institutions."
"Learned a new word - chuffed. Yes, much overseas news is more accurate than the US govt Newspeak."
TS...I agree. Did not believe cuomo either. We were right...overinflated his needs.
