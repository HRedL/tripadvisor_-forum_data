We've rented a wonderful home on the island in August of 2020 for our Anniversary celebration. Bringing the whole family. How is the weather then and should we be concerned about the Red Tide? Are businesses open or do they close down for this time?
We were there for a week in September this year and everything was open. The weather will more than likely still be hot.No way to know about red tide that far in advance.
It will incredibly hot and humid in August. There is no way to know if there will be red tide. Just have to wait and see...
"Heat and humidity is subjective. Having been warned for years by good friends not to visit in August for the heat and humidity we had followed that advice. Then a few years ago we did have to visit in August. Since then we have always personally considered the weather in August quite tolerable and agreeable. Yes, it is hotter and more humid than in say April or May, but we have not found it at any time unbearable and indeed consider it preferable to many places I could mention. The Island breeze certainly helps."
Always best to rent a house with a pool if possible!
"We are renting there in August too and are worried about COVID-19, not sure if we should cancel or go as planned. Any thoughts?"
Sorry but there is no way to tell what the covid situation will be in August - it could be better or worse.They barely know what it will be like in a weeks time.I personally would cancel but that's as much because it's hurricane season and it's too hot for my liking
Unless they shut down the state again we are going! We've talked as a family and everyone is on board.
Thank you
