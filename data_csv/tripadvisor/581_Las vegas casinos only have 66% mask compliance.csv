Govenor is not happy with compliance rate.... why do casinos not enforce the rule?
Is that the percentage from before OR after they were mandated??
OP randomly posts things like this without any source or context. So ...did the Nevada governor’s office issue something about this? Or is it just another Vital Vegas or bartender rumor?
"that number is from a cross section of myriad businesses that were observed, not just casinos. crazies just love to make numbers up out of thin air. ""tens of millions dead"", ""1000 people dying per day"", etc. sadly, mouthbreathers listen to these abject morons. they will never allow themselves to understand that tens of millions of REAL humans are actually being negatively impacted by this insanity because it's a fact that their favorite tabloids/politicians will never cite. https://news3lv.com/news/local/66-of-souther…"
"Compared with other places, 66% is good. Getting compliance in social activities where alcohol is involved was always going to be hard. Doing so when the effing President of the United States is openly urging non-compliance makes it almost impossible."
"Like they always say, ""Two out of three ain't bad."""
87% of statistics cited in the mainstream media are made up! The percentage of faked statistics on social media approaches 140%.
"From the linked article :“ Statewide, casino pools had a 40% rate, while bars and gaming floors both had 80% rates on July 3.”"
"“ Statewide, casino pools had a 40% rate, while bars and gaming floors both had 80% rates on July 3.”If you take out the word ""pools"" and average the two numbers together, based on today's new new math of ""close enough"", you should get 66%."
"I was at the Nugget over the weekend, and Fremont was crazy crowded Fri-Sat. The casinos did their best to enforce the mask rules, almost being Nazis about it. Sanitizer dispenser were everywhere, and for the most part, people were respecting the mask rule. Though it made it difficult to drink or smoke. That being said, my wife and I decided not to come back until everything opens up again. Beside the mask rule, so many restaurants and venues are closed, or have staggered hours. Hell, even Hog & Heifers is boarded up, and an employee at the Grand said he thinks it might not ever reopen. and they are restricted to 4 per elevator, so you can imagine what the back up was like if you had a room on the 17th like we did. Just not as much fun at this time"
"66% compliance is not going to stop a virus, people. If you want to keep your favorite city open, you're going to have to do a lot better than that, and you're going to have to do it for the rest of the year, so mask up or opt out. Period. https:/…"
"Tom, hear hear.."
"Irishfan, just for curiousity why are you so negative to accept facts... none of us wanted this to happen."
"Here is an article. 80% compliance in casinos. The 66% is misleading. Nevada mask compliance rate at 76% statewide, with 66% in Southern Nevadahttps://www.fox5vegas.com/coronavirus/nevada…LAS VEGAS (FOX5) -- In the latest round of observations conducted by state agencies, approximately 76% of businesses statewide have been found in compliance with the mask mandate that went into effect on June 26. Observations made by the Division of Industrial Relations and Nevada OSHA on July 3 found an 82% compliance rate in northern Nevada and 75% in the south. The departments focused on a water park, hotel pools, bars and casino gaming floors and noted the following compliance: Water park - not in complianceCasino hotel pools - 40% complianceBars during daytime hours - 80% complianceCasino hotel gaming floors - 80% complianceThe division compared the 80% compliance rate for bars observed during daytime hours on July 3 to the 50% rate of those observed during evening hours on July 2.The Division of Industrial Relations and Nevada OSHA have conducted 921 field observations since the statewide mask mandate went into effect on June 26."
I was there 6/26 to 7/3 - and I felt it was more like 95% in the casinos - maybe 50% walking the strip.
"""crazies just love to make numbers up out of thin air. ""tens of millions dead"", ""1000 people dying per day"", etc.""Can you please cite who said these things or are you just making quotations out of thin air?"

"“ Irishfan, just for curiousity why are you so negative to accept facts..”I quoted facts. From the article."
"From what I have observed over the past few days on the Strip and Downtown, I would guess the rate of people wearing masks in the casino at 95%. Walking outdoors 70%+.Every casino has free masks, hand sanitizer, gloves. MGM properties, Golden Nugget and others even have sinks on the casino floor.Unless you are eating, drinking or smoking you wear a mask. If not, security will tell you to leave. I saw it done a couple of times last night. At The D security told a women who was smoking to put her mask on between puffs. LOL :D"
"""Just reported in the Sacramento Bee ""California lawmaker reports ‘mask to mask’ COVID-19 infection""Was this a kissing experiment?"
I thought this post would draw ol' Tom's response. Chicken Little lives.

All Caesars properties require dealers to wear a mask and face shield. That is something they started since last week. Pit bosses only have to wear a mask.
"66% were covered, but that was at the topless pools...."
Definitely agree with BugBarbeque I was there this weekend. The Wynn was very strict. Lots of judging too if you weren’t wearing a mask. Most people I talked to in the elevators were annoyed with the 4 person rule. I know we need rules but this wasn’t a fun vacation. Thankfully everything at the Wynn was open but I didn’t get to use the pool one day because it was at capacity and I missed some of my must dos while in Vegas.
"Nobody has said masks eliminate the possibility of infection, far from it. They reduce the risk when social distancing isn't possible. Simple as that.The lengths people will go to in order to preserve their willful ignorance makes my head hurt."
I was in town over the 4th and I honesty didn’t see one person in the casino without a mask. They were very very strict about it.
