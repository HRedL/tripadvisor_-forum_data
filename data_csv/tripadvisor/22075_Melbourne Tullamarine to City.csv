Don’t thing the Thailand forum is the best place to ask a question about Melbourne which is in Australia

DH and I usually take Skybus if we only have a normal amount of luggage- 1 carry on and 1 medium check in bag. Otherwise I don't think the financial saving is worth spending 3-4 times longer doing a magical mystery tour through the less inspiring suburbs of Melbourne.
My daughter often uses the public transport option from Ballarat to the airport. She allows about 4 hours (2.5 hours from Southern Cross) and only has a backpack.
This previous post may help you.https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g25…
"You will not be able to catch a bus or public transport.You will have to transit by cab or rideshare wearing a mask straight to your self isolation accommodation which will have to be organised before you land.That is, presumably, if you are coming in the next few weeks or so."
"They are domestic, not international."
A natural assumption given that they posted on the Phuket forum & Thai airlines are still running
The bus to Broadmeadows + train is not a good option if you have luggage.If you are returning from OS you will need to go directly to your quarantine location.
Yarramar- where do you get the mandatory mask requirement in post#7?

Thanks. Doesn't appear to apply to healthy people flying into Melbourne. Probably would't hurt to have one to stop the Uber driver freaking out however.
