"Since there have been questions about this, I'm passing on this link from National Public Radio regarding the Measles cases traced to Disneyland. npr.org/blogs/…TA may remove it because it is not a positive story but I think it is of interest to tourists."
"On the news this morning lit was up to 76 cases, I think they said.Also the infection time frame is well into January now, first it was thought the infection period was just a few days in December. Apparently cast members are being diagoned with it too.Glad our vaccinations are upto date, not that that is a sure fire way of avoiding it."
"OK....So, these forums receive a fairly large amount of questions regarding Disneyland... are the TA experts for that area supposed to ask prospective visitors an additional question such as ""Are you vaccinated?"" in addition to ""Are you driving?"" and ""What's your budget?"". Perhaps if they say no, we tell all prospective visitors to stay home??Dr. Z"
I would suggest posting this info on the recent thread already here on the Anaheim forum rather than having a bunch of threads about the same topic.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29092-i65-k805885…
"I disagree happytrip. I wanted the news regarding the issue to be the lead post on my thread, not the visitor's fearful question. It's OK to have two threads regarding similar issues.Since I live in Orange County, this is an issue that literally hits home. Huntington Beach High School had a student come down with measles and they have now banned all unvaccinated students from school for 21 days."
"It is an outbreak. No where in the article does it refer to the current measles event as an epidemic, which would affect thousands of individuals. It is a serious situation, but not epidemic proportions."
