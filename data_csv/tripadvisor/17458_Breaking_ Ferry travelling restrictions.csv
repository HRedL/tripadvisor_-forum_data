"#5. Lots of new restrictions announced this evening. Pubs, clubs, restaurants, cafes, gyms, cinemas, theatres, etc, to close TONIGHT. Just a few hours’ notice. Schools have already closed. Sporting events cancelled.These measures are overdue in my book. Streets are virtually empty, roads eerily quiet. Majority of people, where possible, are heeding the advice to stay home."
Tonight?!Good Lord!
"#7. Yes, tonight. Think the timing was to ensure establishments closed before the busy weekend period."
