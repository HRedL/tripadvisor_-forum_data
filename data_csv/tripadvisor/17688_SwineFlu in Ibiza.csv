"Hmmmout of all summers, the damn flu spreads when i plan my first trip to Ibiza..../sighi just want to ask Ibiza locals, how big will Ibiza be affected with this epidemic, if there will be restrictions on the island."
"In other parts of Spain where there have been outbreaks, the only thing that has happened is that schools were alerted, but stayed open. There have been no deaths in Spain yet. This type of flu has not been malignant in Spain yet."
