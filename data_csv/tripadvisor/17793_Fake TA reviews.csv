"Not naturally a suspicious person, but I've found that a lot of the hotels in Jordan (especially in the Petra area) seem to have one review contributors raving about particular hotels. Nothing against one review contributors, as we all have to start somewhere...PMs are then not answered on over 10 msgs sent to these various reviewers to verify their amazing reviews.Whilst this problem is all over TA, not country specific, can anyone let me know how to spot fake reviews? My crude check at the moment is to ignore all one review contributors and anyone who just post repeated raving reviews in the forums on recommending one particular hotel/tour guide."
"Yeah it sucks that it's prevalent, but that's how the internet isPersonally, I look at their history - if they created their account to drop a single review/forum post, I start having questions.Also, repeated promotion of a hotel/tour group is usually a flag. Same with very generic reviews like ""what an exceptional holiday!"" without going into details of the sites/accommodations/etc.Very poor English is sometimes a sign too (usually if taken with all the other signs)"
"Hi chewietobbacca, yes I agree with the poor English is sometime a flag, combined with other tell tale signs... It's such a pain, since I'm trying to organise my other holidays in the year and don't want to be sieving through every single reviewer's background and PM them to verify. I wonder what Tripadvisor is doing to stop this from spreading.Just so ppl don't think I'm targetting Jordan, I'm visiting Marrakech next week and fake amazing reviews on Riads are also a problem there. But since the Marrakech forum is more active, the Destination Experts will generally be quick to put someone on the right track.Anyway, can't wait to visit Jordan at the end of the year."
"My experience is that it is common. I simply try to ignore first posts which are overly gushing, without any detracting factors. No place or guide can be that good. And those posts actually lower my estimate of the thing reviewed.Sometimes I report the blatent ones at ""report inappropriate posts"" for TA to look at. And somtimes TA removes them. I imagine it may be a tough call at times.Edited: 9 years ago "
Fake posts also are epidemic on Jordan forum .I spend lot of time reporting them to TA staff to be removed.When i have some spare time i will check out those hotels reviews that you mentionedThanks for bringing that not so good news to forum
