How has anyone got through to Opodo? I've rang several times been on the phone for over an hour and had no answer. I'm trying to get through now as I type this and have been waiting to get through for 2hours!! I tried Facebook messenger to no success and tried the form on the website but still nothing! Is this company real? and is there any other way I can get through as I have an urgent query. Please help
You chose a dreadful company that provides poor servicenormally. With all the flights transiting China being rerouted and cancelled it will now be woeful
"Maybe do a Search on this forum for Opodo. There are many threads, and most with lots of replies. Perhaps someone in one of those threads told how they got in touch with Opodo?Best of luck,Hunt"
"To keep prices ‘cheap’ these online ticket sellers have to automate many processes and keep staffing levels to a minimum. They are not set up to offer first rate customer telephone support and instead offer FAQ’s and self manage options online under Manage My Booking. At the best of times reaching a customer services or support human will be tough. Add to that the worldwide issue with the corona virus and many airlines changing schedules, amalgamation of flights or completely cancelled flights, plus a few thousand people just wanting to change travel plans, and the system falls over. Contacting them will likely be time consuming and frustrating but I fear you will have to suck it up."
"'Opodo Customer service'Putting Opodo and Customer Service in the same sentence?.........Ur 'avin a larf!On a serious note,a shonky with a terrible reputation for customer care....then add in the mad panic of the Corona Virus......there will be huge demands on their very limited customer lines.....you choose this company....with very low review scores....I just hope the price saving was worth the risk."
"Nita, you can't expect decent service form the likes of Opodo at the best of times. At the present time, with large numbers of people having their travel and plans disrupted, it's inevitable that things will be a lot worse.They aren't going to pay to employ more staff and train them up quickly to deal with this situation. No, they will continue to pay as little as possible for non revenue generating functions, and they won't care how long it takes for customers to actually get through or get an answer. Nor will they care if an enquiry is urgent.That is the model for all third party ticket floggers."
"If anything good comes out of the coronavirus situation, it is that a few more people might realise that putting a third party reseller between yourself and the airline is really not helpful when anything goes wrong."
You’ll probably get through to them in the spring when this epidemic (hopefully) resolves. Maybe by then your situation will no longer be urgent.
"I am sure they are swamped with requests right now due to all the flight cancellations. You will probably just have to be patient while they work through them.Next time, consider booking directly with the airlines."
To update after just over 2 hours I finally got through and the person I spoke to was very helpful. He explained the reason for the delay getting through is the influx of calls they've had. They initially refused a refund but as I had also gone directly to the airline who agreed to refund some amount opodo have agreed. Fingers crossed I get something back
Glad you got a positive outcome.Might be however best to avoid them for future travels given your experience.
"Please let us know whether they follow through with the refund, and what, if anything, they deduct in fees."
What number did you get through on? Thanks!
