"Hello,I would appreciate any advise, as Im confused if I should travel to Brazil solo, tour package(hoping there will be others in a group)/day excursions or mixture of both tour/solo because of safety.  I have travelled before solo but concerned about the horror stories I hear about Brazil. I always wanted to visit Brazil for the soccer, beaches and parties/night life but never knew anything about the violent attacks on visitors until now.I plan to use the metros and taxi, and walk to near by attractions but not buses from what I have heard.The places I plan to visit are as follows:RioCorcovado Mountain with Christ Redeemer Statue and Sugar LoafGuanabara Bay , Botafogo area, Copacabana beach, Arpoador, Inpanema Beach, Leblonbeach/areas, Lagoa beach/lagoonFeira de São Cristovão Light and sound musuemn – CopacabanaRio Scenarium + lappa Night LifeHippie Fair Crafts Market, Praca General Osorio | IpanemaCentro do Rio AntigoRio de Janeiro Soccer Match Netorei day trip to Musuem of morden Art + Buildings by Architect Osker NeimarDowntown• Sscadaria Selaron (steps of Art) • Catedral metropolitana de são sebastião Sao Paulomuseu de arte de, Bairro da Liberdade ,instituto cultural tomie ohtake, Centro Cultural São PauloFIESP CULTURAL CENTRE SAO PAULO, Mercado Municipal, Rua 25 de Marco, Iguatemi, Banespa Skyscraper, Rua Oscar Freire- Paulista lies JardinsBrasilia –good architecture and works by NeimarIguassu Falls Sightseeing Tour from Foz do Iguaçu + National ParkMorro Branco Day Trip from Fortaleza Chapada Diamantina day tourLençois Maranhenses in Maranhão (sand dunes with pools)Chapada Diamantina day tour"
"Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit Brazil every year without incident. But obviously you need to be careful. Here are some safety tips for first-timers in Rio:http://bit.ly/113p9YfThe most common forms of crime affecting tourists are pickpockets and street muggings.Kidnapping in Rio de Janeiro, other than express kidnapping, is not an issue as it is reported to be in some other Latin American countries. (Express kidnapping [Portuguese: sequestro relâmpago] is a method of abduction where a small ransom from an employer or family member is requested. An ATM seizure, where the victim is forced to withdraw money from his or her account, is another example.)In the past, the security risk was higher than it is today and police protection has improved significantly in the Zona Sul (Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon, Lagoa, Jardim Botanico) and Barra da Tijuca in the last two years. Today, although the likelihood of experiencing crime in Rio has diminished, it still exists. It has to be said that much of the crime that occurs is opportunistic crime. Meaning that criminals focus more on those they think are easy or high-value targets. For example, the elderly, someone walking alone at night, or someone wearing lots of jewelry.While Rio does have a certain security risk involved, visitors can greatly minimize their risk by following a few common sense rules.Try to travel in a group preferably with local friends. At night, avoid walking on the streets alone.Be careful about public transportation at night. Take a taxi and not a bus at night. Late at night, consider booking a radio taxi or calling for a regular taxi, especially when travelling to less secure or unfamiliar locations. Many people prefer calling a taxi company rather than picking one randomly in the street. The line 1 of the underground (especially, Centro-Copacabana) is perceived as being safer that buses, but at night the entrances to the subway stations are a focal point for the homeless.Be aware of your surroundings and others when walking on the street. Especially at night. If you see a group of young kids that look suspicious walking towards you, cross the street. Avoid dark/enclosed areas.Do not walk around wearing flashy jewelry or expensive looking items. A basic watch or wedding band is okay (prospective criminals won't be able to distinguish between a fake Rolex or costume jewelry and the real thing).Do not carry a lot of cash around. Carry around only enough for your expected purchases and a credit card (none if you don't expect to use it). Leave the passport and other credit cards in the safe at the hotel.Make a copy of the biographic page of your passport and carry this with you. Do not keep all of your money in one pocket. Distribute it in different pockets.Take extra care when taking out money from an automatic teller machine. Beware of suspicious characters lurking near by. It is best to use the machines located inside banks, buildings and shopping centers.Keep digital cameras in your pocket or in non-descript paper or plastic bags.Don't leave belongings unattended.The city centre (Centro) should be visited during work hours (but be aware of pickpocketing there); it is generally considered an empty and dangerous place during the weekend and at night—although some parts of it have been renovated, particularly the Lapa district, where many world-class samba clubs are located. Always take a taxi when visiting Lapa and make a reservation at the club you intend to visit in advance.Rio's beaches are beautiful and seemingly tranquil, and as such may lull you into a relaxed sense of safety. It has been reported, however, that thieves are on the lookout for people who appear to be alone and have cell phones, watches, jewelry, cameras, or anything that can be quickly stolen."
"Hello Thanks for the feed back.About Lappa, the bar/club and resturant areas are they safe at night?What is a radio taxi, are these the licensed meter taxi, the ones which are yellow with blue stripes?"
"Lapa is the historic home of samba music, the centre of Rio’s nightlife, and one of the city’s most visited areas. Don’t miss it. The area around the clubs and restaurants can be iffy, so be careful and always take a taxi to and from Lapa. http://nyti.ms/rer2Ydhttp://bit.ly/ntRVxyTribOz in Lapa is dedicated to jazz and bossa nova. Brazilian and international musicians, singers, composers and artists meet at TribOz, the official location of the Brazilian-Australian Cultural Center (Centro Cultural Brasil-Austrália).http://bit.ly/14Q79bwThe Best Music Venues in Lapa:http://bit.ly/zZKAKgRio Scenarium: go early (7 p.m.) and avoid the long lines.http://bit.ly/Y91qEQhttp://bit.ly/PBXUzhVirtual Tour of Rio Scenarium:http://bit.ly/12MWs8CBest Clubs in Rio for 2013:http://bit.ly/VncaB4Best Bars in Rio for 2013http://bit.ly/XnUhC7Radio Taxis: Immediately upon exiting the customs clearance area at GIG, you will find three or four booths for the radio taxis. Just speak with any one of the attendants and pay for your taxi (cash or credit card). Process takes about three minutes. (Ask for a discount, and you can get around 10% off.)You’ll be given a slip and told where to meet your driver outside of the terminal. You then hand the driver the slip, tell him the name of your hotel, and you are immediately on your way. It’s really very simple.Radio taxis are for the most part new, clean, and the drivers, many of whom speak some English, are professional and trustworthy. You pay a bit more, but you do avoid the usual hassles.You can pre-book a radio-taxi return at the airport when you first arrive. Before you are ready to be picked up at your hotel, it’s best to call the radio taxi number to confirm your prearranged time and place for your departure.Yellow metered taxis are different from radio taxis and can sometimes be problematic. It’s very likely that 90% of metered drivers are honest and trustworthy, but as TripAdvisor points out in its Rio Travel Guide, you may occasionally encounter a swindler driving a metered cab. Recently a metered taxi driver caused injury by driving away to avoid giving a passenger R$4 in change:http://bit.ly/VfCGYTTaxis in Rio:http://bit.ly/153rfMD"
"I can tell you about iguassu falls , it is safe.I think the recommendations are the same one for all big cities all over the world.Have a good trip."
"Hi Lumflux,Your security depends very much on yourself ....A simple rule : be discrete and try to blend in as much as possible in the locals.Don't show fancy cameras, golden chains, expensive watches ... do not count your money in front of everybody when you take fresh cash out of the ATM, etcIn short DO NOT SHOW you have things that are worth a lot money.I you use a ""better"" camera you want to use then I would advise to put it away immediately after each use, or just cover it with a shirt (or whatever thing that makes it look ""unimportant"" ;-)Another tip : leave your passport in the hotel and just take a copy when you go out (police do accept copies)I am living in Salvador for many years now (as an expat) and I do believe it is not more dangerous than many big European cities such as London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, ...Enjoy Brazil Lumflux !Ivan Bahia GuideEdited: 7 years ago "
"Thanks for the advise everyone, if theres anymore I should know kindly let me know.One other thing about taking cameras ,most visitors do take one, so there must be alot of people around with cameras in touristy places?"
I noted you mentined some areas around clubs and resturants can be Iffy? You mean outside the main entrances to the venues or near by streets where there are no people?I assumed Lappa ws a lively place with many people and lots of visitors/tourists so less chance of any trouble? Especaily out side Rio Scenarium or ajoining places?Is it safe out side of the clubs/bars in lappa to look for a taxi?
Taxis wait at the curb directly in front of the clubs.
Brazil is such a famous and beautiful travel destination in the whole world. According to me Brazil is safe to travel but we need to be careful in our tour. Thanks to all for giving useful tips for a safe travel in Brazil. Also we choose proper hotel and resort for stay with family.
Thanks for the feedbacks
"Significant crime issues that include rape, robbery, and kidnapping. Rape has increased by 150% from 2009 to 2012, although some of that increase is likely due to a change in the law that increased reporting. Brazil is home of ‘quicknapping’ where a tourist is kidnapped briefly for a stop to the ATM to get cash and then released. Another innovative crime technique are ‘motoboys’ who do armed robbery by speeding up on a motorcycles, robbing at gunpoint and then fleeing quickly. Particularly worrisome are some of the hottest destinations for tourists, like big resorts, hotels, discos, etc. Tourists are specific targets in Brazil, particularly at night. Travel near any of the borders to countries like Columbia are considered hazardous enough that the US government will not let its employees travel within 150 km of the borders with surrounding countries like Columbia."
With nearly every tourist visiting Brazil having a camera in their posession; where on earth are all these stolen cameras going to???There must be a roaring trade going on somewhere...
"Lumflux, I'm brazilian, from Sao Paulo. All the tips that you have received here are very good. Particularly about Sao Paulo, I think that you should avoid some places. The neighborhood called Cracolandia is a very dangerous place. Don't go. It is near to the center of the city. In the center, you said that you want to go the street 25 de Marco. Be careful there. Try to not look like a foreign. Fancy cameras being hold as a necklace, it is something that you should avoid in every place in Brazil. Another thing, cellphone. If you have an Iphone or Samsung, or something like that, be careful too. Now, it has been a wave of this kind of robberies. Only a tip about Sao Paulo. It is the biggest city in Brazil. But mostly, it is a business one. However, you should include in your itinerary the Ipiranga Museum (it is the one about our independence). Go to the museum of MASP in Paulista Avenue. Visit (by taxi) the Estaiada Bridge. Go to a steak house, they are awesome, but don't look for the cheapest one. Otherwise, you will not have a good image about our barbecue. Another thing that you should try is Pastel. This is a brazilian fried dumpling. It is delicious.They usually have this thing in fares.Have a good and a safe trip. Enjoy!!!"
Lapa felt very safe also at night.. Lot of people on the streets and in the bars. Take a taxi to get there and to leave. I know many people who travelled alone in Brazil and had no problems at all. Fotos. I got a cheap small camera which fits my paints.. so if I see something I can take a picture.. I also have 3 memory cards so if the camera gets stolen I dont loose all my pics. SP I would not stay too long there as it is a business city... If you stay at for example Jardins its very safe and you can walk there at night.. but SP has bad sides as well so take a taxi at night. SP is expensive though.. The can charge like 90 Real for a plate of pasta and you have places where they ask 180 real for steak.. But they have good cheap Churrascarias as well.. One I went was 30 real all you can eat and it was the best meal I had in whole brazil!

"I'm there for four months, still there but in Bonito now.Rio seemed very safe but having travelled very much over 14 years I don't get problems as I walk tall, look at home ( not like a lost confused foreigner) and I'm a man who can defend himself a bit. Losing items myself is a more common problem but I've been hearing of some people in Rio during carnival time being mugged in broad daylight and others just watching. They said police Wern't interested either Everywhere in S.America you have to watch your things even on the bus so you're never 100% safe but yes try not to carry valuables, have deep pockets for cash etc, don't look alone and vulnerable and take copies of documents and spare credit/debit cards in a secret compartment"
"The OP is not recent, but for the benefit of others . . .Of the places mentioned: all very safe but some tips:Copacabana beach, Arpoador, Inpanema BeachJust be aware of the possibility of muggings. Walk away from anyone who looks suspicious, even daytime. Don't go on the beach at night.Feira de São Cristovão - quite safe, though the immediate vicinity is a bit run down.Rio Scenarium + lappa Night Life - Scenarium is very upmarket. Beware of pickpockets in the crowded Lapa area near th Arches, that's all.Downtown - avoid at night and the weekends except for a partiocular destination (eg a show) or the afternoon marketsSao Paulo --- all very safe, but consider Pinacoteca if you are an art lover.FIESP & MASP can be done the same day as they are very close.Lençois Maranhenses - be aware that although there are pools in the rainy season, this is a desert and gets very hot. Some guides are misleading suggesting you can walk across, which is foolhardy unless you are very prepared and have a guide. You can visit the S.Luis side easily just to see the dunes. The Atins side is more effort (boat ride) but worth it. Most tourists go to Barreirinhas and get duly hammered for a group tour."
"I came from Brazil in December , I took all the advsie given on tis forum and found it to be safe, but always take precaution and use common sense.I was scared at first then once there felt farely safe even walking along the beach at night on the pedsestrian walk way as its full of people. Just do not go down dark places with no movement of peolple and keep valubles safe and you will be fine.Rio I was out til 1 - 4am, SAO Paulo was out till 11pm - no problems as long as you use precaution as above.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Sorry, but I´ll fo straight to the matter: Brazil is not a safe country.If you are a tourist, be aware to not seem a tourist at all.Observe what people wear, shirt, sandals, paints... and wear the same.We are a friendly people. Maybe one of the most friendly and reliable people in the world.But not everything is a bed of roses here. If you travel by bus, be aware of people who kindly offers you something to eat or to drink, like candies, soda or cookies.These stuff may contain some kind of drug that make you sleep, so some burglars take this time to steal your things.This scam is usually known as ""Good Night, Cinderella"".But, ease your mind. There are so many people with a sincere smile, ready to help you, even though the most of us, brazilians, do not speak any other language than portuguese."
"lumflux, I totally agree with your impressions on safety when travelling alone in Brazil. I had a very similar experience travelling on my own for 12 days this past Feb/Mar.I paid attention to the behaviour of others (women in particular) and followed my instincts. I didn't do anything that people around me weren't doing. I took buses/metro after dark. Hailed regular cabs on the street late at night after clubbing. Used my camera when the mood struck me. I also strolled along Ave Atlantica/beach path (Rio) at night - tons of people doing the same.It goes without saying that I employed basic travel safety practices - but no more than I would've in any other thriving metropolis I've visited.I don't speak Portuguese and have an iffy sense of direction (lol) and still felt very safe during my time in Salvador and Rio. I have travelled a fair bit and found Brazilians to be some of the warmest (and patient!) people I've ever met."

"Yes agree, not as bad as one sees but always use common sense. Every country has good and bad areas, anything can happen to anyone at any place at any time of day. USE Common sense. I even went to the Maracana World cup Stadium to watch a match..local darby. was safe and good amomgst the jumping and raving crowed. Eeven when I had push pass them to get to my seat they help me along....very nice of them....lolTGo be honest I was scared what I saw on tube about fights a flares going up, but guess its what match you see and staduim u go to. I watched Flemgo v Fleminase"
"Yeah, I've felt safer at some Maracana games than games in the UK. No problems with alcohol (people mostly don't drink to get drunk) and it's generally a good day out where you can take the kids. There's the occasional problem with a controversial game but less than other countries. Brazilians genuinely love their football. As in, a warm feeling in the heart."
Yes much better than uk soccer
So to round things off - anyone travlling to Brazil just use common sense and you will be fine. Yes there are car jackings but only if you go through the wrong areas. Stick to the main roads the touristy/crowded bits.I went to Rio scenarium up to 4am no problems getting back by cab. Was in Lappa just join in and mingle with the crowed and you will be ok.
I'm pleased yu had a good time. Did you honestly manage to go to all the places on your list including the amazing Lençois Maranhenses? Quite a trip!
Went to most places accept the sand dunes and chapa. I even went to Argentina Bueno Aries in between too.
Brazil is not safe AT ALL!!! I am Brazilian and live in Brazil so I know what I'm talking about. If you decide to come be very very careful because they kill for a pair of sandals or sometimes for NOTHING and the government doesn't give a S... for anybody.
So this explains why your profile says you live in Canada?
"All Im saying is that if you use common sense and be aware of your surroundings and only go to safe areas like I did, you will have no problems. Yes some places and crowds can be scary but who would go to such areas any way. I travelled alone too.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Yes, yes, yes: always use common sense and be aware of your surroundings if you want to have a safe and satisfying stay in Brazil--or any other country, for that matter.“Is it Safe to Travel in South America?”http://bit.ly/19xhmfB"
we are going brasilia and rio to enjoy fifa.how is the climate at that time//is it safe to roam there?
"Hi - My sweetheart and I went last summer (2013). We went during a more relaxed season - late July. We traveled to Sao Paulo (we even went to the zoo), Rio, Salvador (during the Sao Joao festival) and Recife. We were extra cautious, we were perfectly fine. I am very happy that I went. I'd go again. I'd probably skip Recife, because it was a bit dull. The food in Salvador was amazing. My sweetheart loved Rio. Sao Paulo was incredibly vast. I have a friend who is Italian and had some trouble in Rio during the Carnival season. Off season is ideal. Also, note that getting a visa can take time, so give yourself a few months in advance just in case."
"@mahua1958: Brasilia is dry, so make sure to have something for your lips. Drink lots of water. It's a sprawling city and there's limited public transportation. People definitely use cars a lot there.You don't need a car in Rio and it's relatively easy to use public transportation here. You can use Rio's forum for further information. I'll be glad to answer any doubts there.Make sure to have your visa ready.CheersEdited: 6 years ago "
So right now I have the new Galaxy S5 as my cellphone.Is that too good of a phone to carry around in Brazil?I can just switch out with my backup phone for traveling
"Brazil suffers with sensationalized journalism about violence. In fact, only 6% of the brazilian population live in slums. It´s not the ""hell"" that the press loves to enlarge. The violence in Brazil is not spread, it´s concentrated in some places dominated by drug dealers, such as some slums in Baixada Fluminense and neighbourhoods in São Paulo (for instance: Luz station during the night at São Paulo). You just need to be careful to not go out alone in São Paulo´s downtown AFTER MIDNIGHT showing to everybody that you are a foreigner and that you are lost, except in some places such as Avenida Paulista, Jardins, good neighbourhoods etc. If you stay in normal places (such as touristical points, middle/high income neighbourhoods, beaches, middle sized cities (such as Buzios, Arraial do Cabo, Paraty), there will be no problem to you. Remember: the more beautiful is the place, the safer. Never enter inside a slum (if you see you are going to an ugly place (a very poor, dirty, dark) get out or call a taxi), except those slums that receive tourists during the day, such as Rocinha. Brazil has thousands of middle size cities with excellent beaches, that are not famous. These cities use to be very calm and safe.Personally, I´m 32 years old and I never saw a crime here. I lived in São Paulo during 15 years, and I went to Rio many times (and also visited Salvador, Brasilia, Fortaleza, Florianópolis, Goiânia etc). The only place where I felt a little bit insecure was on the Rodoviaria Novo Rio (in my opinion, the worst bus station of the country).Edited: 6 years ago "
"HiWe (family of 4, kids 16 and 11 years old) are planning a trip to Brazil this year around June/July and i am very concerned about the crime especially now that i have read that Brazil has the most murder record in 2012? 47 106 to be exact. My husband got a business trip so thought that it would be nice to extend it for a family holiday. What do you think or is this overrated? Which destinations would be a must see and are of less concern in terms of crime?"
"Surely you must visit Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's #1 tourist destination. I would recommend that you book a room in Copacabana, Ipanema or Leblon, three of the safest neighborhoods in Rio.Copacabana Pictorial:http://bit.ly/1c0UWnrCopacabana—Princess of the Sea:http://bit.ly/1nmP7oCA guide to upscale eating in Copacabana:http://bit.ly/1lVX93SIpanema Pictorial:http://bit.ly/13dN6OgIpanema: Rio’s Iconic Beach Neighborhood:http://bit.ly/1fQlGciLeblon Pictorial:http://bit.ly/1b5zSbGLeblon: Living the Rio High-Life:http://bit.ly/GEzUO1Leblon Restaurants: Rua Dias Ferreira is Rio’s top restaurant destination.http://bit.ly/1xizcuzSafety tips for first-timers in Rio:http://bit.ly/113p9YfStaying safe in Brazil:http://bit.ly/1axXqHJ"
"Just like South Africa, there are areas with a much higher crime rate than others. Safety concerns do exist but can be mitigated if you choose to stay at a nicer area, such as Leblon and Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro. With a family, I would choose Leblon, which is a very calm and upscale area of Rio."
Is it safe to bring a big camera along while walking around on the desert in Lencois?
"We just got back from Brasiila, rio and Pirenopolis.We felt safe everywhere we went however we were with a Brazilian family!We did not see any crime what so ever.That was our experience and we had a wonderful time! You need to speak Portuguese if you are going alone"
"Hi, Dawn -- it'd be great to have a trip report of yours at the Rio forum. We have a permanent thread full of reports! :) tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g303506-i1199-k698…"
"Hello- As a blonde hair blue-eyed female in her twenties, I felt completely safe. However, I went everywhere with Brazilians (which by the way are the best people on the planet) I did almost everything on your list you have planned. I since have visited 6 more countries and Brazil has by far been my favorite. Attempt to learn a couple phrases, however English is really prominent. I would take all jewelry off and invest in a couple shirts/jeans that are a brazilian brand. Foriegn brands REALLY stick out and make you a target. Absolutely no jewlry whatsoever. Just enough money for a taxi and some food is plenty. You will love it. Obviously, stay out of the favelas. Rio's have a reputation for a reason, if the locals won't go neither should you. Have a blast. Visit Prihaina beach. I probably spelled that wrong. It is the best beach in Rio."
Ohweis:Prainha Beach: the ultimate surfing beach in Rio:rio-de-janeiro-travel-information.com/prainh…Edited: 4 years ago 
"Rio is mostly okay under the right conditions but I disagree with others who have said English is prominent. Not in my experience. None of my taxi drivers spoke English and many of the young Brazilians didn't know much English either. If you are not an experienced traveler, I would highly recommend not traveling alone in Rio as a young woman. I was safe and never a victim of any crime, but I also had two native Portuguese-speaking Brazilian guys with me. One of them always walked directly behind me, the other in front of me, to deter any potential criminals. I never walked anywhere alone. Be very careful in the metro stations. Never have all of your money in one spot/pocket/bag. Don't carry your actual passport on you. Trust me, there is a reason you have to take extra precautions outside of the super-rich neighborhood of Copacabana. People don't become victims because they were extra cautious, not because Rio is necessarily safe."
Nobody is visiting Brazil. I have yet to see any tourists here. It's an extremely dangerous place with hobos and drunks all over the place. I will definitely not recommend anyone to come here.
I don't see why would you even put yourself in danger and choose Brazil over other great locations. Don't tell me the beaches as there're much nicer beaches out there and countries where you can visit without having to worry about your safety.
"Paul F: ""Nobody is visiting Brazil""?A new survey released by the Ministério do Turismo (Ministry of Tourism) shows that Brazil welcomed over six million international tourists during the year of 2014.The survey shows that the number of international tourists in Brazil increased by approximately ten percent in 2014 and nearly tripled during the first half of the World Cup tournament.“Sporting and music events also attract the attention of foreigners,” said Minister of Tourism, Henrique Alves. “By hosting the World Cup and events like Rock in Rio and the Olympic Games, the country tends to stand out and become a destination increasingly desired by foreigners.”http://bit.ly/1lgAMMy"

"I was planing to travel Brazil with my wife, today I have seen a this video. I am really afraid now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8q4MQsTHzoLove to travel South America, but still no plan as it looks like crazy."
"Is it safe to travel in Brazil? I'll get to that. But first, I lived and worked in Brazil for 9 years. I could write a book about the country. I learned to speak Brazilian Portuguese to native level. I'm 71-years old now but those 9 years in Brazil were the most illuminating, enlightening, and enjoyable of my life. I love Brazil and would live there now if I could afford it. Now about travelling in Brazil as a tourist. When you travel anywhere abroad you are out of your comfort zone especially if you don't speak the language. Travelling by bus is a great way of seeing the country, stopping for a few days wherever you want for as long as you want. But don't expect to make friends with any of your fellow bus passengers because they almost certainly won't know any English. Nevertheless, Brazilians are very inquisitive about foreigners. Whilst they respect and admire Americans, Germans, the French, and Japonese for various reasons, British is their most admired nationality. Long haul bus trips are broken up by 30 minute toilet breaks and a change of driver about every 3-4 hours. A 60 minute meal break happens every 2-3 stops. If you took the trouble to learn some Brazilian Portuguese before travelling, the locals would love you for it. But why Brazilian Portuguese, you ask? It's mostly a question of accent; To me, Iberian Portuguese is like listening to a jar full of angry bees! It is so full of sibilants as to be an assault on the auditory system. In contrast, Brazilian Portuguese is so much smoother and musical. Compare an Irish racing commentator (firing out words like bullets from a machine-gun) to a Texan drawl and you'll understand the comparison. I'd like to post my email address in order to discuss specific issues, including the Zika virus, but I don't know if this is permissible so I don't want to risk it. Is it safe to travel to Brazil? Yes, provided you take those sensible precautions when travelling to any exotic destination."
Brazil is the most dangerous country with the highest crime rate in the world.
"@Jeff T - Just making up numbers? Brazil isn't as safe as Switzerland or Japan as examples, but it's more in middle of the pack when it comes to crime and murders. And most murders are drug related and in the favelas so tourists can avoid those areas.@Nil R - If you read the travel tips, most of the crime is snatch and grab and that's why this forum is full of advice to leave jewelry and fancy watches at home (or as a minimum, don't wear them when walking on the streets) and don't walk around with your cellphone out where it can easily be grabbed out of your hand."
@dgfisher1 - Why would anybody want to vacation in the good old US of A where a woman (12 or older) is raped every 8 minutes?

"I am brazilian and I think you can travel that alone but keep some stuff in mind. Dont walk alone past about 8:00 on a street with no people, and i would advise u not to take the metros- speciall At night. Its true that it is dangerous, so just dont seem to much like a tourist if you know what I mean. Also be careful with cameras."
"The 2017 Carnaval holiday had fewer accidents on Brazil’s federal highways, but the number of deaths increased, according to a report released March 2nd by the Federal Highway Police.http://bit.ly/2mDvrUK"

Can you tell me about Brazil. My daughter is traveling alone to Brazil. Does she need any shots or anything like that to protect her.
She should get a yellow fever shot since there is a yellow fever epidemic in parts of Brazil.
"Dear friend, unfortunately with the communists wanting to implant communism in Brazil after the Military Regime, Brazil has not become as safe as it used to be. The violence has increased, but the attractions are still beautiful. If you come here, do not walk in alleys near shanty towns and have good luck. At least know the basics of our language."
"Lived here all my life. Perfectly safe. The smaller the city, the better you should feel. I'm from Rio, crowded city. Chapada Diamantina and Serra da Canastra are biiiiiiiiiiig amazing canyons. Trancoso (Bahia) is a great small place to see. Want to know big cities? Then the problems turn bigger, too... but that happens everyday in any other country. Cheers!"
"I'm sure the best place I've ever visited in my life is Balneario Camboriu! Full of more than 185 types of cheap hotels, beautiful beaches, including Praia das Laranjeiras, that is a nude beach in the other side of the mountain...Balneario Camboriu is full of attractives that you and your family would love!"
Its really dangerous.. i have no clue why you guys want to come to this damn while has europe and other continent
Thanks for the great info.!!
"Among the places you mentioned you shoul be careful in Rio and São Paulo. There are many pickpockets and thieves, they very big cities. Most of Brazilians like to be sucessful in everything. It includes cheating as well unfortunatelly...."
"In Latin America a lone woman is generally perceived to be a prostitute and not a respectable women. It is a very chauvanistic area and in Brazil as in Mexico women are treated as sex objects and it is important to be careful about how you dress. A friend spent a year traveling alone all over the United States and was only raped once. I guess it depends on how comfortable you are with the increased risk of being sexually assaulted in return for the ""freedom"" to travel alone.Edited: 2:02 pm, October 27, 2019 "
