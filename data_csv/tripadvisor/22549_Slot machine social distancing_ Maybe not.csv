"“ Las Vegas startup Smith Rosen Gaming Partitions, born during the coronavirus pandemic, is bringing self-cleaning slot machine dividers to casinos.Smith Rosen Gaming Partitions CEO Jeff Smith told FOX Business’ Stuart Varney that the technology uses ultraviolet light to clean its surface while promoting proper social distancing.“It actually maintains the integrity of how slot games should be,” Smith said. “It has a nice lighting feature as well, and at the same time it cleans the surface and gets rid of that bacteria and disinfects.””( article continues...)"
"The best part is that they will allow casinos to open, and after a vaccine comes out, they can be put away until the next virus comes from China."
It's a good compromise. Done.

"Unfortunately, the guy doesn't know what he's talking about. Note first that he used the term ""bacteria"" - Covid-19 is caused, as you certainly know by a virus. Second, the type of UV light that is effective against corona viruses is UVC, which is most definitely NOT something you can install in public places.This article makes it completely clear: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200327-…""UVC is really nasty stuff – you shouldn't be exposed to it,” says Arnold. “It can take hours to get sunburn from UVB, but with UVC it takes seconds. If your eyes are exposed… you know that gritty feeling you get if you look at the sun? It’s like that times 10, just after a few seconds.”"
I agree with #5 but surely the company and casinos know that as well hopefully. My only thought is that they specifically say self cleaning partitions - they don't claim the partitions clean the slot machines.Maybe they'll be sort of like fiber optics where the UVC light is essentially contained by the partition itself? I'm no scientist so I have no idea if this would be possible or effective.
"And maybe there a way you can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning."
I see what you did there etonthelake..lol
