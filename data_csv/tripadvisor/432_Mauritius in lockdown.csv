"Hi Ash.Can you please give us some more details for toutists on the island, cannot find Prime minsters speech on Google. Can we still go to beaches. Will restaurants be shut etc. We went to supermarket early this evening as we thought we had better get in a few supplies knowing about the three cases, the panic buying had just begun and shelves starting to be emptied.Our trip to lle aux cancelled tomorrow.(fair enough)"
Please refer to the link below. You’ll need to translate it. I don’t think any restaurant will be open but supermarkets and shops will be. As for going to the beach I believe you should be ok if you’re isolated but I don’t think being around a crowd will be allowed https://www.lexpress.mu/article/372853/covid…

Well, it's a state where you are isolated in a place. Here, it's a state where you have to stay at home to avoid human contact in order to reduce any risk of contamination with Covid-19.The Prime Minister clarified ""that people will not go to their place of work"" during this period of confinement, except employees of essential services and certain economic activities.

Please do let us know if you hear of any problems with getting off the island we are due to fly out on the 23rd with BA. Keep safe everyone."
"Has anyone been out and so far gauged the extent of this lockdown? Does this lockdown definitely include a walk on the beach for example? Also, what are people’s thoughts on the possibility of this full lockdown being extended beyond its current 15 day time frame? (I understand it’s impossible to predict, but I’m curious of any insight) I am currently wondering whether to cut my losses and fly home before departing flights are halted, or stay put here until May, when the lockdown could have been lifted and flights could resume. Baring in mind my home country isn’t much better right now. Thank you everyone!"
"Hello Oliver the authorities are pretty serious about the lock-down. Road blocks have been set up in the several parts of the country and you may get pull over by the police.https://defimedia.info/confinement-national-…Also, the coast guards have been ordering people out of the water at Trou aux biches.https://defimedia.info/confinement-national-…You should be ok being on a beach till its isolated and there won't be any risk of contact with anybody else.London is pretty bad right now it has sort of become the epicenter for the virus in the UK.But on a positive note the 7 infected people are in a stable condition in Souillac hospital.

She explains: “We still have around 1,500 customers in our hotels and they are leaving as they go. We are confident that they will all have a flight home. We are in constant contact with tour operators and other partners to coordinate these departures, which are often anticipated (…) Like everyone else, we were caught off guard with regard to the confinement deadline. As provided for in our protocol, we have implemented the measures that prevail in the event of a cyclone on alert 3: we are reducing services and gradually increasing restrictions.

"Thanks for your reply. :)Yes, it is certainly good that Mauritius is taking this very seriously. It’s also good to hear that everyone seems to be stable. I have a rescheduled flight back to London booked for the 27th March, though my friend has suggested staying here instead and waiting it out. My concern with this is that the flight cancellations and lockdown will keep being extended further and further into the year, and I will find myself stranded here indefinitely in isolation, with no options to go home. Though, as you say, the U.K. isn’t much better... but, it‘s still home. It’d also be nice to stay and see Mauritius, as I’ve seen none of the island so far, and now it’s under lockdown. :( It’s a tough decision, with pros and cons both ways. Best of luck to you, hopefully everything will work itself out without any major issues."
Oliver if I were you I would leave Mauritius on the 27th otherwise you might find yourself in lockdown for the forseeable future.We lived in Mauritius until last year and believe me if I were still there I would be on the first flight out.Mauritius is not the UK and despite OK healthcare in normal times who knows how it will cope with the crisis? (12 and counting.)
"Oliver, I too would take your flight.Over 18 years I have made visits that are part holiday, part family visits, so seeing more local infrastructure at work.I suspect that food distribution networks could come under a lot of pressure given that local produce is heavily dependent on labour and weather, and huge amounts of food is imported and transport logistics and quarantine restrictions may become an issue.Mauritius, fantastic as it is, is a small island a very long way from anywhere."
"Well, looks like that I've escaped from Mauritius just right on time (17.3.) :-D"
"Goodness me.We need to get to the airport. We are staying in Tamarin and our flight is 22.10 tomorrow night 23rd.We where leaving Tamarin about 16.30 to drive there to be able to drop off the hire car and then wait. We are in private accommodation and have no access to a printer so was going to show a photo of our flight.Is there any number or preferably an email address so I can message to get a permit for us, last thing we need is to be turned away by police road block. Surely it cannot just be us in private accommodation either.Any ideas as what to do."
Just noticed it says 8pm curfew. Will just have to go for it and hope for the best.I have written on a card in French heading for the airport and put it in the car window.Fingers crossed we get through.

"Wow, eventually I found information regarding the lock down and what is allowed and what not.We are also in private accommodation and not in a hotel. We have received no option from our airline to fly back home earlier and when we queried it they just said everything is still on schedule and the flight on 28 March will continue to South Africa.Only to receive a cancellation notice of the flight two days ago with no solution or option when to fly back to SA. My problem is we are here with our two toddlers.... What is safe and what not and what if one of us gets sick.... Just normally sick not even the virus. Also did not know anything about the spraying or road blocks or anything. If I could just at least have a date that we can fly back.

Hello Marvi the authorities have said about distributing supplies to people during the lock-down I'll share more information once I have them. In the meantime contact your host and ask him if he can provide some supplies for a few days. If you can't get any bottle of water then I'll suggest boiling tap water and leave it to cool for drinking.

"Thanks for the list, Bronia. Very helpful."
"Just returned to UK from Mauritius on the last flight by British Airways. Married to a Mauritian, I have been visiting Mauritius for 40 years and have always felt very welcome. However, as an independent tourist staying in AirBNB apartment, there was little information or consideration given to those who must fend for themselves. A supermarket lockdown of one week without notice is unacceptable and will damage tourism in Mauritius. Of course, its a very serious situation, but you cannot leave people without food and we were lucky to have relatives to fall back on. Glad to be home under the circumstances."
I totally agree..... Unfortunately we were not so lucky to make it back to our home country and with two kids not having shops or info is really frustrating.I do understand it is crucial times and respect that but it would have been nice to have a back up for people without sufficient information.

As for those who are in Azuri, it has already been three days since they left the center. Almost similar situation to Quatre-Soeurs. But ultimately, they will be kept for another 10 days. The reason mentioned by the authorities is that they must undergo tests to check whether they are carrying the coronavirus or not.On the side of the Ministry of Health, an official source indicates that all people in quarantine must undergo the test before leaving. The extension was made on purely medical advice.In this case, why not carry out the tests on all travelers in quarantine now? ..

Unfortunately yes Bronia but nonetheless the number of new infected is dropping and the number of cured has risen to 42. Also the number of quarantined people has dropped from 2000 to 379 leading to several quarantine centres closing down. Hopefully that trend continues :)

Don’t know that we will get to Mauritius this year. For the first time in fourteen years.

Not sure exactly what she means with the ""than""?https://defimedia.info/covid-19-beachcomber-…"
Ash I am not sure. Can they afford to stay closed for over 18 months until October 2021?I would imagine that once international flights recommence all hotels will start to move towards reopening.Mauritius relies on tourism.
I believe she meant that when everything will be back to normal before the coronavirus started spreading. They’re looking to start opening 8 hotels initially with limited staff and strict hygiene measures and will focus on the local clientele before people can travel again
"No new cases reported todayEdited: 9:35 am, April 29, 2020 "
"Then Beachcomber's chief comunications officer should say what she means Ash. Clarification is needed.Air France intends to resume most of its flights to Africa from July 3. However, some destinations will be served earlier. This is the case of Mauritius, for which operations could start on June 15. At Air France, we are talking about three flights a week to start. The same would apply to the services of the French company in Madagascar. Ditto for the daily service to Cairo, as well as 5 flights per week to Cotonou and 7 flights to Abidjan.It all depends of course on the reopening of the borders. Air France is gradually resuming its domestic flights from May 11.Air France is also facing enormous financial concerns and is working on a vast restructuring plan.At the end of last week, the company received the promise of aid of 7 billion euros (Rs 300 billion). This aid will break down between 4 billion euros (Rs 170 billion) in bank loans guaranteed 90% by the French State and 3 billion euros (Rs 130 billion) in direct loan from the French State-----------------https://defimedia.info/air-france-vers-la-re…"
"Off topic slightly - this new virus will not go away in a few months, especially with movement of people around the world.

But access to banks and supermarkets will still be based on an alphabetical system. Markets or any event with potential mass gathering won't be allowed to take place.Restaurants however will be allowed to open but only for delivery. Carers can from the 15 attend patients at home. Public transport will be available, however they should be properly disinfected and apply strict hygiene rules during the journey. Elderly won't be allowed to travel during peak hours. Schools won't resume until the 1st of August. And finally the bad news access to the beach is still denied along with bars, casinos, clothing retails, shopping centres where they'll all remain close during this first phase."

I'm totally agree. Covi-19 is dangerous and containment in most countries is being very difficult. I'm very happy that Mauritius has managed this situation so well
Even if we do let visitors in I'm more than certain that they'll be put into quarantine before being allowed into the country. On another note no new cases for the 8th consecutive day :)

Dubai are also aiming to restart tourist flights in July also where I live.I’d have to assume they will not have a 2 week quarantine period, otherwise this would make going there and re-opening the tourism industry pointless? It may be a case of having to remain in your hotel and still use the facilities not a strict quarantine. Let’s see!"

Just had an email from Air Mauritius. Our flight from Heathrow to Mauritius 27th June has been cancelled due to extension of flight ban until end of June.Looks like we will have to wait to visit your beautiful country.... :-(
Jason sorry to hear that.We changed our flight with Turkish airlines from June to December with no penalty or extra cost even though December is more expensive being high season.Would MK let you have a change or would that not fit in with plans?Having said that MK is currently facing financial problems so not necessarily a good idea of mine!
"Holiday is with Virgin, so will probably take the cancellation and sort ourselves something next year"
Good idea - we did that with a Cyprus package we should have taken in May and we are now going May 2021!

I know chances are slim but Air Mauritius and Emirates say the flights are stil confirmed so we cannot cancel nor do anything else if we don't want to lose the money.I read that commercial flights will start again on July 1st, but I doubt everyone will be let in. If any of you hear or read anything about the way Mauritius is going to open the borders and to which countries, please do let us know. I do hope we won't have to wait until mid July to know what happens to our booking.Any advice or opinion is welcome.Thanks!"

So our flights are booked for 16 July with BA. BA are still selling seats on the flight so possibly this could be OK? I'm thinking that the flight prob won't be busy so social distancing might be easier. Obviously subject to FCO advice that it is safe to travel. Does anyone know what is planned in the way of arrivals tests at Mauritius? We live in a very low infection area in the UK so it's unlikely that we will be infected between now and then if we continue to be careful. Is there a date when the Mauritian government aims to reopen borders? Would love to be able to start dreaming of my holiday again. Thank you

According to UFC-Que Choisir, they continue to violate the regulations by imposing on passengers vouchers to reimburse their canceled flights. In doing so, UFC-Que Choisir decided to take the fight to court.

South Africa won't be opening their borders for many months to come and we make up a good amount of travelers to Mauritius.

Two other flights are planned for June 24 and 30 to repatriate other Mauritians working for cruise lines.https://defimedia.info/rapatriement-larrivee…"
Thank you for the (sad) news. At least now we know that we definitely won't be able to fly in August :-(.Hope we can reschedule soon...
"Thank You Ash, We will fly with Emirates through Dubai so I hope it will be OK :)"
"I would bet on September before Europeans are allowed back into Mauritius, though I could be wrong."
"@Ash our company is Emirates/Air Mauritius. But if they do allow some flights, I doubt they will allow European travellers in, like Bronia said... Yes please do post it when you have the list of companies, we have to wait until the flights are officially cancelled anyway - they still appear to be confirmed as of today - but I do not hold much hope!Thank you all for the precious info!Edited: 12:51 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"we have just paid our balance for our package holiday for late September, Will just have to wait and see what happens the next few months... thanks to the folks on this forum for the updates :)"
"I really thought that the Govt would introduce some kind of testing before flying. It seems they've opted to go down this route possibly because it's low season. For those that have antibodies and are willing to pay for a test before fllying and having another on arrival, it's seems a great pity not to allow them in. I'm sure there are many in the tourist industry who would welcome a return to work. Come 1 September, the situation is not going to be much different now."
"@FrequenFlier I agree, but seeing their strict policy since the beginning of the pandemic, I imagined they'd follow the same lines on the reopening...However, a tourism page I follow on Instagram today wrote that the news on Mauritius keeping the borders closed until August 31st is still only 'unofficial'. Is that correct? Wasn't it an official statement? I do hope they'll decide how to proceed very soon. Being uncertain is worse than knowing for sure that we can't go - and it delays all the refund/voucher procedures...:_("

Report in remaining closed until August 31st: https:/…
Two days after the official tourism board declared preparation for a reopening soon ... Some new flights scheduled from Europe from July on (e.g. Swiss). I think the 31rd of August is not set in stone ?
"Hello everybody,that is a good news, but on the other hand, it is still unclear, all we have to do is wait.. I guess it would be OK to have negative tests and they let you fly to the island.."
"Hello Ash, good news about your country and airlines, although I wait for Emirates.. hope that postponing to few days later to Sep is enough and they will fly there to your beautiful paradise. Take care :)"
"As a tourist hoping to come in July or August, when I first read the report by L'Mauricien I assumed that there would no possibility to visit until the Spring months. But, and here's the list of ""Buts"", I've not managed to find any another Mauritian media with this story, airlines have not cancelled their flights and this story has not been repeated either as far I can tell by the wider African press or anywhere. I don't think I have ever known a leader of country to state something that is so important to the economy of their country and not to have it repeated by other news organisations. Has anyone heard what is official policy, preferably from a government website? If L'Mauricien's story is not correct, why haven't they retracted it? By comparison, when Argentina announced there should be no commercial flights until 1 September, it was broadcast by all media AND all alrilines cancelled their flights. Does anyone have a good idea of whether tourist flights will go ahead in July or August?"

It is truth that airlines does not cancel any flights in summer, My flight reservation in Emirates for 30th Aug is still confirmed."
"This was discussed in the Covid-19 Mauritius FB group yesterday given that Air France plans to resume flights.One post read:""There is no such official information from the Office of the Prime Minister of Mauritius.

"The UK Gvt has said they will announce the countries they have created a 'travel corridor' with on 29th June.I guess these will be the countries from which you can return without having to go into self-isolation.So in the UK we won't know if Mauritius is on that list until 29th - Mauritius might announce open borders, but in the UK we won't know the conditions for our return. I am hanging on and waiting to hear about flights, conditions for travel (tests / any isolation or quarantine conditions on arrival etc) and conditions for return, before I go anywhere.I don't want to get on an 11 hour flight with passengers who have not been screened in any way."

"Doing a quick search on flight availability, there are flights available from beginning of July with Swiss, South African, Emirates and the odd other airline. The number increases through July with BA running in August. Air France stands out as not running flights until September and sadly Air Mauritius also (probably for logical reasons as high season starts to approach). Keeping my fingers and toes crossed some firm guidance comes out soon allowing entry with sensible precautions (eg test before flight) so that these airlines don't have to cancel."
Turkish Airlines are also scheduled to fly IST-MRU starting July. However that doesnt mean anything unless they open the borders.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53104733
Sorry wrong link!https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/turkish-airl…
"Hi FrequentFlier,""Air France stands out as not running flights until September""That surprised me, as I'm supposed to fly to Mauritius with Air France in mid-July and my flight status is still displayed as confirmed! Moreover, all Air France flights to Mauritius starting from July 6th seem to be confirmed (link for reference: https://wwws.airfrance.pl/flight-status/flight-list?date=20200706&flightNumber=AF470). On the other hand, I've just tried to search for the first available flight for which it is currently possible to buy tickets, and the result was September 1st :( (https://wwws.airfrance.pl/search/open-dates…)."
"Hi Guardafui, I just looked at when flights could be bought, which you correctly imply is not same thing as flights not flying! Hopefully we will get clarification from the govt when the borders open, your flight is not cancelled and Air France start selling tickets again. I take some optimism that Air France have not cancelled your flight. My own flight with BA on 2 July was cancelled on the 4 June. I suspect it was a more economically driven decision if BA's flights in July were not very full along with the border opening date being unknown.It is frustrating that nothing is coming out of the Govt. Hopefully no news will be good news eventually."
"Just checked Turkish Airlines flights MAN-MRU and no flights until 8th September.This could change of course but at present it is looking as if the borders will be closed until September.Emirates seem to have odd flights available from mid July but I wouldn't bet on it.It would be helpful if the Mauritius government was a bit more transparent though we do appreciate they may not as yet have made up their minds as to when exactly they will reopen the borders and to which airlines/nationals.Edited: 7:38 am, June 21, 2020 "
"Hello.yes, unfortunately we will have to wait, that's all we can do now... I guess it should be OK since Sep, but it really depends on government of Mauritius. Then all the airlines in the world can renew flights.."
I am lucky in that I rescheduled my flight from June to December so hopefully all should be fine by then.I have some European flights scheduled for September and October and they are going ahead.European destinations seem to be getting their post covid planning for hotel and flights well organized.Pity Mauritius doesnt seem to have started any planning to reopen.No new cases today.
That really is awful for all those pilots.
"Hi Guardafui and everyone,regarding flights not being cancelled despite the news on borders remaining closed until Aug 31st: my flight was on July 31st with Emirates/Air Mauritius and when I login on both the companies'websites it still displays as confirmed.However, Air Mauritius stated officially that they won't operate any commercial flighs until at least Sept 1st and my travel agent told me the flight is indeed cancelled. So I think that we shouldn't rely on what appears as 'confirmed' as that is probably going to change soon.Sorry to bring bad news :-(."
I would say it the flight is not bookable now then it wont fly.

"Hello everyoneI have got relatives from Canada stranded here since March 2020 and they are trying to get back through Turkish Airlines. However it seems that the Airline has been re-scheduling their flights since 1 June 2020 as they try to preempt the date when borders will be opened. Officially it is scheduled for 1st September 2020 but i would not be surprised it will open sooner due to pressure from the Hotel industry.I suspect it might be done in a staggered way with regional countries like Seychelles/Reunion island in first ,then Australia/New Zealand and European countries where the pandemic is under control. A loophole for European visitors wishing to come in might be transiting through Reunion island which is part of the EU."

The minister of tourism Joe Lesjongard announced today as a precautionary measure tourists visiting the island will be bound to their hotels and won't be allowed to mingle with the locals for 7 days at least. He also mentioned about setting up a screening laboratory at the airport before allowing visitors in. However when asked about the border reopening Mr Lesjongard replied that the government is still working on it.https://www.lexpress.mu/article/379251/confe…
"English language version says he hinted tourists wouldnt be allowed to mingle with locals? He didnt say it was a fact.The Minister of Tourism had this to say today:Responding to a question from journalists, however, he hinted that tourists who come to Mauritius will not be able to leave their hotel to ""mingle with the locals"" for the first seven days of their stay at least. This, as a safety measure compared to the Covid-19, of course.He also stressed that the government was working on a plan for the possible installation of a screening laboratory at the airport. But also on new procedures concerning private jets, the partnership with the English club in Liverpool, green tourism, technology as well as a rebranding to boost the sector.Regarding the reopening of our borders, he only said that the government and the Prime Minister were working on the file.So they still havent decided on border opening.Here is the whole Express in English - all articles.https://translate.google.co.uk/translate…"

I have booked this year for 2 weeks so it would be maybe OK, but some people can not take like month holiday because of work we all know that. Let's wait for another info, it is still in progress..."
"Yes I wish they would just get on with a plan like other countries.I have misgivings about his last paragraph which seems to imply mauritius will give freebies to ""bloggers"" and ""experts who will sell Mauritius in return for free trips."" Commenting on the concept of ""rebranding"", the minister repeated that Rs 50 million will be injected for the marketing of the sector. “We signed a partnership agreement with Liverpool over three years. And, at the beginning of next year, we will allow bloggers and experts to come to sell the destination, ""concluded Joe Lesjongard.""Not exactly designed to give a balanced impartial view of the island to tourists if they pay these people to come and blog."
"Hello Vaclav the question was put forward about what if tourists were staying for less that 7 days and the minister replied that the government are still working on it. But he hinted that visitors will require to take a test on landing before being allowed into the country. He also mentioned that if people are staying for more than 7 days then they’ll require to take another test on the 7th and 14thdays as we’re currently doing for people in quarantine. Pressed by a journalist what if a tourist was tested positive and he replied that they’ll provide the necessary care to that person but still working on a plan about containing any contamination in the resort the person was staying. Denise I do agree it’ll be really helpful if they provide more info about the reopening but I believe they’re trying to be very careful to avoid a 2nd waveEdited: 8:20 am, June 25, 2020 "
"I think the idea of testing is very good. Personally and I think speak for many tourists, being confined to the hotel is not an issue but not ideal. What potential tourists really need to have is a date they know they can arrive. My first choice is to spend August in Mauritius. Given the complete lack of guidance I am taking flexible options in Europe in the hope I can come to Mauritius last minute without penalties elsewhere. Most tourists need notice to plan, airlines need to plan and hotels need notice to have everything ready to reopen. None of which can happen until a date is given. The ideas the minister mentioned are broadly good. Asked when it'll implemented and giving no guidance is bad for the Mauritian economy. Separately, BA have stopped selling tickets for August and my return flight for August has been cancelled."
"Joe Lesjongard, who was previously Minister of Tourism, will now be Minister of Public Services following a shake up of ministers resulting from the dismissal of the Deputy PM:Steven Obeegadoo will be the new Deputy Prime Minister.

The announcement was made by Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth at a press conference this afternoon.Steven Obeegadoo, who is also Minister of Lands and Housing, will also be responsible for the tourism portfolio. As for Joe Lesjongard, who was previously Minister of Tourism, he will now be Minister of Public Services.https://defimedia.info/breaking-news-collend…I doubt that will make much difference to any decisions regarding tourism."
"Hello Ash,exactly, I do not have problem with doing a test, but would have with staying in hotel for half of my holiday... It would make sense to have 2 tests if people will be there for 2 weeks, I get it. Well I see the situation changes every day so I take it half seriously... the final decision and programme will be serious."
"No new cases today, the numbers remain at 341."
Two covid tests and 7 days quarantine for a 2 weeks holiday is ridiculous.They should clearly state that they are not going to open and present a clear plan how tourism can restart after that date - without a quarantine and separation from the locals. I travel to other countries because I want to get to know local life and locals. Complete fail how the situation is handled.I´ll stick to Europe this time.
The balance of our villa booked through Airbnb is due in 6 days for a stay from mid July. I’ve been awaiting news about the opening of borders but not sure it will come through in the next 6 days.

Also a big thank you to the regular contributors on this page where I have found the most useful information
Caroline borders won’t reopen until the 1st of September
Thanks Ash. Is there a link that I can see for this information to send to Airbnb ? It would be useful for me otherwise they are offering me a voucher as refund not cash

"Oh dear!London Heathrow Airport:17 Mauritians working on cruise ships and who were to board a flight at London Heathrow Airport on the evening of Monday June 29, were unable to do so.6 were under the influence of alcohol, 8 missed their flight and 3 tested positive for Covid-19.150 people were to arrive in Mauritius on this flight.Karl Mootoosamy, communications advisor for Foreign Affairs, deplores the fact that some were under the influence of alcohol and had ""deplorable behavior"".According to him, this situation will penalize other Mauritians during the next flight. https://defimedia.info/rapatriement-17-mauri…Mauritius has no new Covid cases today.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"

A video from Palms hotel in Quatre Bornes showing how sanitary measures may be applied by hotels on the islandhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysDpeTQDlY
"But nothing about rooms?This was part of an email sent to me yesterday by OMAAT and which I posted on another fourm.I have had emails from all the big chains - Hilton, Hyatt, IHG, Marriot and a few of the Mauritius chains about their new cleaning protocols post covid and social distancing etc.https:/…Hotels tested were:Hyatt Place Times SquareHampton Inn Times SquareTrump International Do click on the video in the article - it's an eye opener.I was shocked about the bedding not being changed at a Hyatt a, Hilton and a Donald hotel, but not so shocked at things like the remotes.So can we trust hotels hype about their new covid policies? I for one will be taking anti-bacterial wipes as well as the usual hand sanitizer and a plastic sandwich bag to put the TV remote in!"
I have just watched the video and its pretty gross and it makes me wonder about the cleaning standards in normal times! Palms hotel was the only one to put a video about their reopening so far and the sanitary measures they're applying but nothing about their rooms . I can only hope other resorts give more details how they plan to maintain their sanitary measures when they reopen
"Hi everybody, thank you for new info.Well, last time I stayed in some apatment in Flic en Flac, where we can cook, it was really clean, so I will not be scared of things if I come back in Sep.. what is more, the virus can not survive for days on the surface of things, and you can still bring your own dezinfection and make it clean. I do not sleep at 5 stars hotels but of course I stay in clean apartments.. I hope it will not be closed, because it is perfect for us.Do you have any news about borders or controls at the aiport? I guess the negative test will be necessary."
"Just seen the video link of New York City rooms not being cleaned properly. Dont forget, New York, US is in a dire state especially for people who are poor and cannot afford medicals,therefore do not get proper treatment for Covid 19. Those people are the ones who have to work in hotels for long hours with low pay. The hotels have a shortage of staff because of Covid 19. These people are dying unnecessarily because of poverty (lack of medical care) in the US. Facebook is full of 'Go Fund me' requesting help for medical treatment in the USEdited: 8:38 am, July 03, 2020 "
"Erin, that criteria could apply to a lot of countries who use cheap labour not just NYC. Housekeeping staff in a lot of hotels are paid peanuts and are often at the bottom of the socio-economic pile.So a strong possibilty that staff are cutting corners in a lot of hotels. We have to rely on hotel managment enforcing their new rules and giving staff more time to clean rooms and ideally better wages.Let's be honest here, it's an open secret that corners are cut in normal times so who knows what's happening now.The point is the hypocrisy of some of the hotels who spout off about their enhanced cleaning etc and the fact that they may be putting guests at risk."
"I am not surprised by these findings. I always give hotel sheets a sniff when I arrive and quite often they still smell like another human and in that case I insist on them being changed while I watch. It's gross. My friend once worked for a UK chain (albeit >10 years ago) and said she often just wiped down sheets rather than changing them and that it was normal practice. The UK Govt has just announced the list of countries in their 'travel corridors' - meaning you will not have to self isolate for 14 days on your arrival back to the UK from these countries (as long as you have only been to countries on the list). How they would police this in real life I don't know, however, Mauritius and Reunion are on this list, which is good news!Edited: 10:50 am, July 03, 2020 "

No new cases reported during the weekend. Also Mauritians stranded in 27 countries were repatriated today
"It is actually quite scary how many repatriated people are testing positive (as I doubt many thousands are coming in?) , and shows how present the infection still is outside Mauritius. And what a good job Mauritius are doing. Here, quarantine and isolation are managed by the individual. Which does not give me 100% confidence!"

"Good morning,oh nooooo, I have not read it yet, but it sounds too bad :( And yeah, why would we fly 12 hours there if we should stay at hotel only, omg, I hope it will change til Sep, I should fly in Sep.."
Mauritius Explored is a Mauritian travel company and the link he gives to the PDF file doesnt verify what he is saying on his page as far as I can see? The PDF file is dated June.The info he gives is from his Facebook page?I would wait for official announcements.
Anyone interested they are discussing tourism on Tele Plus Direct at the moment.Seems like a lot of hot air as usual.ie how would we conduct excursions etc. How to balance the welfare of the local population vs opening up to tourists.Too many people with opinions. We need to hear some facts from the Mauritius government.
Yes Bronia they're discussing about how the virus mutated and if its safe to reopen borders link ishttps://defimedia.info/mutation-de-la-covid-…Will sum it up once its over
"As far as I can make out during the hour long discussion with representatives of the hotel industry and one tour company rep and the WHO rep for Mauritius, there is continuing discussion with them and the government, but they can't decide on a protocol for reopening the borders.They have looked at the way other countries have reopened but Mauritius still cannot decide on any protocol.One guy said maybe next week the government may come up with some ideas and protocol for the tourism industry.There is still ongoing discussion and lots of ifs and buts.So no one is any the wiser!Oh - and ignore the info given by Mauritius Explored.He posted on this forum several times and gave incorrect info and was also reprimanded by TA for having two user names........."
"Thank you for your update, we are supposed to be paying our balance tomorrow but not sure what to do as we were planning on hiking and scuba diving so can't really go ahead if excursions are cancelled. Will be a shame as was looking forward to seeing Mauritius, it looks beautiful"
"Thanks for the update Bronia, the hotel owners must be pulling their hair out. We are due to be there in 7 weeks and 6 days but I'm not counting,ha ha."
Hello I have more news about the reopening. There’s talk to impose a tax on the air ticket so as to pay for the corona test. All tests performed at the airport will have to be paid for and a screening lab is being installed as we speak https://m.defimedia.info/news/tests-de-depis…
"English translation of Defi:Things are moving very fast right now at the government level. Several meetings have taken place in recent weeks regarding the opening of borders. Once this is done, all tests performed will be chargeable.(No surprise there - that's one thing coming we kept hearing and took as given.)Some time ago, the government was looking into setting up a laboratory in the arrival hall at Plaisance airport to carry out tests on Covid-19 and the place has already been identified. According to our cross-checks, the equipment is being installed and the staff will be trained. The laboratory will be operational by the beginning of August. https://defimedia.info/tests-de-depistage-la…Most people planning to come have already paid their air tickets, so will be interesting to see how they can add it to an already paid air fare.Contrast that with Cyprus where the hoteliers and government are meetng the cost of tourist testing:https:/…I know Mauritius is probably not so well placed to meet the cost, but it's interesting what Cyprus proposesMeanwhile an IATA study noting the apprehension of of 4,700 travellers from 11 different countries including India, UK, France and SIngapore on travel was said to be worrying by the the president of the association of tourism professionals in Mauritius Daniel Saramandif. He said that it is preferable to open the borders only towards the end of the year. He fears that hoteliers will not be able to reach a sufficient occupancy rate if their establishments reopen in July / August.https://defimedia.info/tourisme-rapport-inqu…So still some disagreement there.Ash, what was your take on yesterday's debate?"
"Given the numbers of people testing positive but asymptomatic, I wonder what would happen if you are found to be positive on arrival? I would not want to get off an 11 hour overnight flight and be taken straight to a quarantine centre.Shouldn't people be tested at their departure airport? Before sharing a cabin with everyone else. Also countries like Mauritius would be able to develop a faster more confident schedule for opening if testing was done before embarkation.Edited: 7:50 am, July 10, 2020 "
"More repatriations:Emirates EK 701, tomorrow, Saturday July 11. 289 Mauritians, stranded in 17 countries, will take off from Dubai at 2:30 a.m. to arrive in Mauritius at 9:10 a.m. They were trapped by the closure of borders in America, Europe, the Middle East and Pakistan, according to a press release issued this Friday, July 10.https://defimedia.info/289-mauriciens-rapatr…No new cases today."
"The representatives of these various associations of the tourism industry have submitted proposals for measures, including health, which could facilitate the reopening of borders while minimizing the risks of the spread of the disease in Mauritius. This is what emerged from a press release issued Thursday evening.It was during a meeting with the new Minister of Tourism, Steven Obeegadoo, this Thursday, July 9.The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Housing and Lands began a series of meetings with stakeholders in the tourism industry, since Wednesday July 8.He listened to representatives of the Association of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs of Mauritius (AHRIM), before receiving those from Business Mauritius and Charming Hotels.These first contacts allowed Minister Obeegadoo to better understand the difficulties of the sector, severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. He also learned of everyone's expectations regarding the reopening of borders. https://defimedia.info/covid-19-les-acteurs-…"
"Bronia here is a summary of the debate from Teleplus. The debate was mainly the opinions from hoteliers about the reopening where they believe putting visitors into quarantine is not worth it. The points and suggestions they advanced are:• Tourist would deter from travelling to the island if they're going to be put into quarantine so there's no point reopening the country and hotels. • Have 2 pcr tests one before flying and the 2nd on landing which should reduce the risk massively• Ask the visitors to stay in the hotel for 2-3 days in the resort before allowing them to visit low risk places and avoid places such as markets, cities and towns where there’s a possibility of overcrowding • Proposed having a tentative reopening date just like the Seychelles and Maldives did• There’s no point reopening hotels with 15-20% occupancy as this won’t cover the cost• Keeping the borders closed (until the end of the year) will be an economical disaster as the tourism industry brings around $2billion to the island. However, they also said that we can’t ignore what’s happening in other countries such as Australia and Germany with a 2nd wave of corona• Lastly the representative of WHO mentioned about the usefulness of wearing a mask and that opening the borders should be discussed among countries to minimise any risk of contamination"
"Ash your take on the discussion is similar to mine in post #455 - nothing concrete.I do find the President of the Association of Tourism Professionals in Mauritius, Daniel Saramandif's reaction to the IATA study negative and unhelpful for a man in his position.That it is preferable to open the borders only towards the end of the year. He fears that hoteliers will not be able to reach a sufficient occupancy rate if their establishments reopen in July / August.See # 459 in which I gave a link to from Defi:https://defimedia.info/tourisme-rapport-inqu…"

"Hi, Mauritius government have not announced a date when the border will open.Also no list of countries that are allowed into Mauritius yet. Sorry."
"Hello, this is strange, I should fly with Emirates in Sep but they did not wrote me anything.. maybe because they do not know anything LOL. Im just so tired of checking information or updates every day :( I hate chanciness..."
Found out today our Oct booking has been cancelled by the travel agent
Who is your travel agent RivkaH-T? Who were you flying with? We have our holiday booked for October but have been told it’s still going ahead.
"Hi I got an email changing the times of my flights I have booked in October from Glasgow/Dubai. I think there is just the 9.50pm flight outward bound (no afternoon flight) and the 7.30am flight from Dubai to Glasgow, again, no afgernoon flight. I would maybe phone and check."
"Just interested who RivaH-T is flying with as Emirates have not cancelled the Dubai to Mauritius for October, but saying that they are showing August dates and the country is not even open."
"Hi we were booked with TUI, I'm not sure why it was cancelled but it's the second time so think we are going with Maldives now"
"I noticed TUI wouldn’t let you search any dates prior to November, maybe they are being cautious or know something we don’t. Hope you get to go somewhere soon, this is our 3rd time lucky"
"Hi. I got the flight info from EMIRATES via my booking account. I am booked on a business flight on 7th October from Glasgow to Dubai and returning 9 days later. They apologised that they had to change my flight times as they are now only flying one flight per day from Glasgow. I don't think they would send me an email with misinformation. Obviously Bronia must have other info which would be great, but I have had to book my hotel for another night due to the flight change so incorrect info would cost me a lot if money."

"Hi,After some changes to my previously booked flight from Glasgow to Dubai. I finally have confirmation that my booking is now on EK28 on 7th Oct 14.35 pm on the A380. I had previously booked the evening flight but Glasgow is now operating ONE flight per day at the moment. I am now booked for my return on 16th Oct on EK27 7.50 am. I had previously booked the afternoon flight. I spoke at length with Emirates call centre, they were really helpful and informative. Basically if you want a flight from Glasgow to Dubai, its on the EK28 @14.35 and returning on EK27 @ 7.50 am from Dubai. I got this info on 22nd July @ 14.00 British time"

This was announced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nando Bodha, at the hotel Le Labourdonnais. He was speaking at the 171st General Assembly of the Mauritius Chamber of Commerce and Industry.“We have a meeting with the Prime Minister this afternoon regarding the reopening of the borders.

that may well mean i cancel our holiday
Stephen - keep an eye on Dubai forum. Shaun seems to think there's some confusion:https:/…107362494
"seems to be a collusion between government and Emirates to me, announce a free covid 19 cover package, then add but you must be clear when you arrive, will see what happens over the next few days but ive gone all this time without symptoms or a test and I arent going through what seems an uncomfortable procedure without symptoms, I guess this is a fundamental change and should allow a full refund from Emirates"
Foreign office seems to confirm this now https:/…united-arab-emirates
"Mauritius recorded a new (imported) positive case of Covid-19 this Friday, July 24. This is a passenger from Great Britain who arrived in Mauritius on Thursday July 23.This person had tested negative during the PCR test before she took the plane to Mauritius. The person is currently admitted to ENT Hospital for treatment. Surely this person had to be on a repatriation flight - there are no other flights?"
Stephen - that FCO advice hasnt been updated since 16th July so doesnt say anything new.

"the transit bit has now been removed from emirates website, I think, ow it appears you have to fill in a health declaration form i believe"
"i know what you mean denise, my plot has long gone"
I’m really getting fed up with this Emirates website has changed again I give up
https:/…Can anyone actually understand this?
Confusing Stephen yes but what I get from a re-read of it is people on that list of countries must have a test prior to boarding an EK flight and then another in Dubai on arrival?All other countries you get a test prior to boarding but arent made to have another test in Dubai?I am probably wrong!
"I think you are tight, I will probably cancel my holiday, not paying £300 for two tests when I have no symptoms and supposed to have symptoms to have nhs test, the whole thing is getting more ridiculous"
"Clinging to the hope Emirates have messed up here, if this is a UAE wide policy its funny there is no mention of this on Ethiad if you are transiting only if Abu Dhabi is your final destination. Although if, and when Mauritius opens its borders it may have similar policy I suppose which I could understand. The dream of going to Mauritius for our ruby wedding has become a nightmareEdited: 4:05 am, July 25, 2020 "
"I'm supposed to be going to Mauritius for 10 nights with emirates holidays. At the moment I would have to have a test a few days before I go at a designated lab at least 200 miles from where I live, a test on arrival, a test on day 7 then a test on day 8 to come home via Dubai on day 11. And we aren't even sure if we are allowed out of the hotel for 7 days! After 4 months of working on the front line for the nhs, this holiday is turning out to be added stress I don't need. Surely they can't expect people on holiday to go through this!"
agree with all that Rhianyddn it really dosent seem worth all that will leave it a few days and if no change I will cancel and up in Spain or Greece where things seem simpler
"Rhianyddn I am puzzled by you saying you need all these tests?Unless you are coming from a country on that list on EK site you only need a test before boarding, not on arrival? In the UK and probably in Mauritius for the return flight.Having said that Mauritius isnt helping matters by fudging any announcement of what will happen if and when their borders reopen, so no one knows if a test will be mandatory in Mauritius.Note that UAE is not on the UK list of countries where you can travel without being quarantined on return to the UK. France have introduced mandatory covid tests, from August 1, for travelers arriving in France from 16 countries including UAE.We are flying Turkish after being loyal to EK for far too many years, so up to now hopefully wont have all that extra worry.Maybe the UAE will clarify things on Monday, but they don't have a good reputation re red tape and contradictory information, as you will see if you check out the UAE forum."
I know the info for Mauritius isn't official yet but they are saying you will need a test in the airport and after 7 days. That's separate from the uae tests!
"Hi folks,I had been made aware of the testing on arrival in Mauritius Airport. Apparently there is an app to download and the results will be forwarded to you within 3 to 6 hrs, if its clear you can go out, adhearing to the local rules, but yes, if you are staying for more than 7 days you will require another test. All this of course is unofficial"
"Mauritius has made no official announcement about opening borders or testing.There's been rumours and specualtion by the barrow load but nothing official.The hoteliers, travel agencies and government are still negotiating.There was speculation on this forum quoting info given by one Mauritus travel agent on his website s about possible tests, but that agent is just speculating and has given false info to posters on this forum in the past on other issues in the past.Edited: 6:51 am, July 25, 2020 "
"if testing was in Mauritius and was not the invasive kind I could live with that and understand it, but if this transit business stays as we are their for 10 nights it would mean one before we go one on arrival on, another after 7 days and marginal if you needed another before flying to dubai on return. and it is the one before we go worries me for us it be at least £300 with most of these clinics charging £25 for a certificate which I believe will be required. that cost is ridiculous"
"Stephen, as I have said people are simply speculating.Wait for the official Mauritius government announcement.Likely they will introduce testing on arrival but no one knows for sure.Mauritius was complaining about people speculating and giving false information on social media, (one person in Mauritius was arrested and charged for this when he said there was to be a new lockdown recently) but they could put a stop to this simply by making some sort of announcement as soon as they can."
"i understand that but flights are starting up in September which is not that far away, and I think its about time the government got its finger out otherwise the Mauritius economy will fall apart if people like me have no confidence in what is going on they will not book in the first place or cancel, people are entitled to know what is happening, the Emirates thing is a red herring hopefully, if the Mauritius government want tests before and during that is fine and then people can make their own minds up but they really need to let people know what is going to happen"
"Hi Stephen. My family have traveled to Dubai today with Emirates, they all ordered the free test at home coronavirus test via the NHS. Once the test is sent back they all received a negative test result via a text. This was sufficient for Emirates and to get into Dubai. I don’t know why you would pay £300 for a test and £25 for a certificate when you can get it done for free."
"I thought the free UK NHS test was only for people who had symptoms or essential workers etc?When we had a test because of symptoms we had to complete a form before we were offered a test at a drive in centre?Otherwise you have to pay for a test.Stephen - that is exactly what I have been saying for weeks!Edited: 7:59 am, July 25, 2020 "
The nhs tests are for those with symptoms. The emirates website states the test has to be from one of their approved labs which would have to be paid for. If 4 tests are needed then that adds up to the cost of another short holiday potentially!
"Hi Folks Just read an interesting article by Arvind Bundhun, Director Mauritius Tourisim Promotion Authority dated 7/7/20. Its about what could happen when (hopefully) and if the borders open"
Thats the one where it says you will be quarantined for the first 7 days. Not much use if you are only there for 7 days!
"yes basically you lie on the Nhs site requesting a test perhaps depriving someone who really needs one. great, no wonder England is a mess with this virus"
"Borders reopen - Announcement date urgently needed, hoteliers sayThe decision expected at the end of the week from the Council of Ministers has not been announced. And speculation about when the borders will reopen - closed since March 18, not to mention the advanced closure for some countries, such as China and Singapore - continue. However, the situation is urgent, say the operators ...----------------------------------------------https:/…Sorry - the rest of the article is behind a paywall!Everyone is getting tired of the lack of response from the government."
"i really despair about some of the worlds governments reaction to this virus, including the ridiculous announcement of quarantine for people returning from all of spain,islands and canaries when most of the surge appears to be in the cities of mainland Spain and the situation in Mauritius is beyond ridiculous, not to mention the Dubai transit business, I get some people mock us who feel the need to get on holiday, but we all handle our mental health in different ways and at my age (66) I need that holiday to look forward to.But i dont need this constant uncertainty"
"My husband was posted to Mauritius for his work, affiliated with the FCO. He,along with the other British staff had to leave their posts on the island on 22nd March. Their posts are ready to be resumed, all permits etc applied for but they can't go back until the Mauritian Government officially open their borders so its just a waiting game unfortunately."
"It is incredibly frustrating but Infection is still high in many areas of the UK, though, and no doubt all governments are anxious not to re-introduce high levels of infection. I have written off international travel until there is long term stability and more certainty.But I do hope those looking forward to Mauritius this year get a happy answer very soon. Luckily I like camping!"
"Hi again, latest update. Another email from Emirates 15 minutes ago. We are now flying Dubai to Mauritius and return to Dubai on 777 ( not A380) as originally booked. It must be a nightmare for the staff who have to keep changing flights and Planes . Has anyone else had their flights changed?."
"I am booked to fly to Mauritius from the UK by Air France in mid-September and I have to say that It does not look very promising at the moment.When looking at the anti-covid rules that Seychelles are imposing on visitors when they open their borders on 1 August, it is enough to put me off travelling. In seychelles, only visitors from low and medium risk countries will be allowed in . UK is excluded from both lists. Even those who can get in will find that they have to use services from ""approved "" providers. That goes for accomodation and travelling around. I suspect Mauritius will take the same approach. Being the type of person that likes to self-cater when on holiday and be free to roam around, I am not sure I am prepared to be treated like sheep when Mauritius does eventually open its borders.Edited: 4:13 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"@ Dano, same as me, if i cancel i get accommodation returned, but not flight. hoping Ebooker will postpone my holiday"
"Dano,same here, should fly with Emirates from Prague to via Dubaj to Mauritius on 2nd Sep, but who knows, it is frustrating to watch news every day, the situation in Europe seems worse now, I hope they would let us come...And yet, if they would, travelling with mask, with fear or uncertainty is not so good for holiday right? I hope their government will decide ASAP about the borders, everyone wants answer. I also hope they would let us go around the island, otherwise it is not worth it to go there..."
"Both my airport and flight time has changed. Emirates holidays state that you can have a refund if there a significant change to your holiday, which a airport change is. I'm going to try this today. Mauritius will have to wait a few years until all this is over."
"The Deputy PM said this morning that the government is still working on a plan to reopen the borders.The opening of the borders must be done in stages, specified the number 2 of the government. First, the state must focus on Mauritians who are stranded abroad, as well as the diaspora who wish to return home, he said.There are also those who hold a ""Resident Permit"" or ""Occupation Permit"", added Steven Obeegadoo, who also holds the Tourism portfolio.“The second step will be the opening of borders and the return of tourists. But when and how? This is the whole problem, ”says Steven Obeegadoo.https://defimedia.info/obeegadoo-le-gm-trava…So doesnt sound positive.I have a residence permit and my husband has dual nationality, a Mauritian and UK passport, so could be amongst the first group.Edited: 6:22 am, July 27, 2020 "
"VáclavIt is only speculation on my part but I expect that the measures in Mauritius might be more or less the same as those of Seychelles. Visitors likely to be required to provide proof of accommodation in an approved establishment for the entire period of stay and must show booking vouchers at the Immigration desk. All this assumes that you are not coming from a low or medium risk country.Those measures have already been introduced in Seychelles when they open borders on 1 August.If this is what will happen in Mauritius then it will definitely put a damper on anyone's holiday I see that the Czech republic is treated as Medium risk by Seychelles and will be allowed in. So perhaps same treatment in Mautitius from 1 Sept. Not so for UK which is on the high risk list .Sorry for all my speculation but in the absence of news the mind gets over-activeEdited: 6:54 am, July 27, 2020 "
"BroniaWhen the deputy prime minister mentioned 1st and 2nd stages, I read it to mean that second stage is what starts on 1 September. It seems that we are already in stage 1 with repatriations , etc. Could stage 2 be what starts from September 1st ?Edited: 7:03 am, July 27, 2020 "
"AndyAs the UK is considered high risk, I am considering changing the September flight. In my case , I can reshedule for October or November. I hope you can also change your flight.No sure I agree with the government's policy of keeping Mauritius in cotton wool . It makes little difference since, at some point, they have to re-open borders and be exposed to whatever is out there. Best to test the waters now when they have everything under control."

"Bronia, Hoping you can help me about the 777, do you know what the baggage allowance is on that plane please. As you know the A380 is 30k. I thought I would ask you before we try to get hold of Emirates. Thanks."
"Hi,Re baggage allowance. I think the minimum standard allowance is 25kg on a standard economy, although I noticed you can get 15kg, but that's on a super saver economy ticket. There are different weights allowed depending on what type of ticket you buy, what class of cabin or whether you have a silver, gold or platinum miles card. I know its not much help but if you go on emirates website and click on baggage allowance it should tell you. Usually it will tell you on your booking itinerary."
"Denise it depends on what ticket class you have and if you have status - ie silver, gold platinum when you get additional allowance.The cheapest special fares allow only 20kgs hold luggage, saver now has only 25kgs, flex allowance is 30kg and flex plus 35Kgs.Business class allowances are 40kgs.See the weight concept here on EK website:https:/…"
"Went on manage my booking, with the changes Emirates have made and times the ticket is still saying 30kgs.I must admit theirs not much chance to go, just in case scenario."
Denise when did you book your tickets?I do know baggage allowances changed the past year and economy saver tickets used to allow 30kgs but can't recall when exactly they reduced the allowance. If you bought before the new rules then you are allowed the old limit.Baggage allowance has changed several time over the last few years.
I think it was around October time Bronia.

The Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, revealed this information to the National Assembly in the afternoon of Tuesday, July 28 during the tranche of questions reserved for ministers.A question on the quarantine centers had been addressed by the deputy of the Mauritius Social Democratic Party (PMSD), Patrice Armance.The Minister of Health indicated that, following requests from passengers, this hotel has been transformed into a quarantine center and that the costs are paid by the passengers.Patrice Armance wanted to know who these foreigners were, especially since the officers of the ministry are very caring for them, according to him.A question that has remained unanswered.In turn, another member of the PMSD, Kushal Lobine, asked who these foreigners were.“I don't have that information,” Kailesh Jagutpal retorted.In an additional question, a third blue representative, Salim Abbas Mamode, clarified that, according to him, South African nationals were residing in the hotel. ""Why are they in Mauritius?""The Minister of Health then replied that he should ask him specific questions for more information. -----------------------------------------https://defimedia.info/voila-bagatelle-trans…The UK FCO have updated their advice for the UAE:With effect from 1 August, all travellers to the UAE must have received a negative PCR COVID-19 test result within the 96 hours prior to their arrival.

Travellers may also need to undertake a second test on arrival, and to complete a period of self-isolation.With effect from 1 August, all travellers departing from the UAE to the EU and UK will need to have a negative PCR COVID-19 test result within 96 hours prior to their departure.

"The press release of Voila Hotel makes it clear that these business travellers are regular visitors to the hotel. It also says that those business visitors made their request direct to Voila Hotel and the Hotel seems to have accepted the request on the assurances of the visitors themselves.

"Dano these business people have been at the hotel since 23rd and this is the first we hear.The only reason it's come to light is because questions have been asked in Parliament today.The borders are still closed, no exceptions except for rapatriations and they arent being repatriated?"
"That is correct. Thanks to the PMSD for asking the question in parliament.We already have the scandal of the prime minister delaying lockdown in March to allow his wife and daughter to come back from the UK. Looks like we are having a new scandal; a hotel successfully pressurising the government to allow foreign nationals inEdited: 2:38 pm, July 28, 2020 "
Looks like there's more private jets arriving on the island from South Africa and Reunion island. The intriguing thing is who are those people landing on the island when we're in lockdown?https://translate.google.co.uk/translate…
This is on Voila's website:https://www.voilahotel.mu/Not sure if it just means the restaurant or the hotel that's closed until early October for the exclusivity of a group............Ash just read your link. Could they be anything to do with the ship rescue?
"As a frustrated traveller, I am going to enjoy watching the mauritian media and parliamentary opposition grill the prime minister over the double standards during lockdown."
"Bronia when Dr Gujadhur was asked the question he said he doesn’t know because there too many private flights landing on the island. The prime example is the recent case from Madagascar where a woman came for treatment at Welkins on a private jet we only found out when she was tested positive. I doubt these people are tourists, are they running away from badly infected region?It could be, hope the government get more transparent about these flights"
"Well if this is to be believed everyone can say goodbye to their holiday in Mauritius:All passengers boarding a flight to Mauritius will have to present a negative PCR test, carried out five days before their departure. Upon arrival in the country, they will be placed directly in quarantine for at least 14 days.The head of government explained to parliament yesterday that since the closure of Mauritius' borders on March 19, 2020, with the exception of cargo flights, all other incoming flights must be authorized by the director of civil aviation. ----------------------------------------https:/…Other news is a call for the MTPA to be disbanded as it represents a huge waste of money and is headed by political appointees (think sycophantism) not professionals who's knowledge of tourism is laughable.Apparently a quarter of the budget for this year has been allocated to Liverpool Football club:----------------With the Covid-19, the time has come to review everything, insists Sen Ramsamy, Mauritius has fallen behind its direct competitors who have already opened their borders to international tourism.

so if we have to quarantine will ebookers refund/cancel our flight and accommodation?
"Going back to Voila, Defi has an updated article on this, stating that they expect another group dependent on flights being resumed:""We also learn that these “regular customers” contacted the hotel in early July to book all of the establishment's rooms until October and that they claimed to have received the approval of the authorities for this trip to Mauritius. The press release specifies that ""another group is expected on a date which remains dependent on the programming of commercial flights""https://defimedia.info/voila-bagatelle-conve…Andy - still no real formal announcement but looking increasingly like this will happen.Its pretty stupid insisting on a test 5 days pre-departure as you could contract the virus any time after that.You would have to ask e bookers if they would refund if this info is formalized."
"Those business ""tourists"" who arrived last week don't mind the 14 days quarantine. They are going to be enjoying the beach for the next two months as they are booked until October . Time is on their side. Who are they and why did the government open the borders just for them?There is clearly more to this. It seems to me the government are in collusion with some of the big players in the hotel industry. The aim seems to drive out the smaller players. We can see that in the conditions being imposed on bungalow and small resort owners and the penalties if they do not meet those conditions . Not to mention the fact that beachfront bungalow owners are facing the threat of expropriation of their property under new government laws."
I think the measures announced by the Prime minister applies to residents or businessmen Bronia. I doubt this will apply to tourists when the border reopens but I believe that anyone wanting to travel at this moment will have to have a pcr test and then be quarantined as mentioned by the PM. Also the minister of health announced that other hotels may be transformed into paying quarantine centres
"Ash have you a link to this please?Where did the PM say this?Only thing I've seen is what's reported in my link above?Your post is unclear - first sentence says only applies to residents and businessmen, second sentence you say ""anyone wanting to travel at this moment will have to have a pcr test and then be quarantined as mentioned by the PM.""Re paid quarantine centres not much info here:""Other hotels may be making the 'same arrangements' as Voilà Bagatelle, which has been turned into a 'paid' quarantine center. This is what Kailesh Jagutpal suggested, as he answered questions from the press after the launch of activities for World Hepatitis Day, at Jeetoo Hospital, in this Wednesday July 29. “Li pa pou res fix (…)” said the Minister of Health, who also commented on the Pack & Blister affair.""https://www.lexpress.mu/video/380519/video-c…Dano where did you see the info re the threat of expropriation of their property under new government laws please?Edited: 8:34 am, July 29, 2020 "
"BroniaThe threat to beachfront bungalow owners is not new. As you know a lot of the beachfront land is owned by the government and leased out (especially the south). New laws were brought in a while back (in 2007 I believe) giving the option to continue with the lease on the understanding that the property might be expropriated or sign a new lease with very high annual costs. That would have the effect of forcing out some owners.On top of the above, there are some 100 requirements to be met in order to register a beachfront bungalow with the Mauritius Tourism Authority . That makes it so difficult and complicated for the owners to get the licence from the tourist authority. Hence many are letting illegally (eg through AirB&B)My parents used to own several beachfront properties on the island . One of them (on the east coast : poste lafayette) was on long lease. The others, Pereybere and Baie du Tombeau I am not sure. I never asked my father. They have all been sold when the family emigrated .Even if they had not emigrated, I doubt they would have been able to keep them."
Thanks for that Dano.I know about illegal airbnbs as we have a warning about them here on forum in Top Questions to the right and the gov said they were finally clamping down on those recently.There was something in the local news this week about land allocation but probably nothing to do with that:https://defimedia.info/parlement-la-pnq-axee…
"BroniaThe only link I could find today about the threat of expropriation is this old article below. Perhaps the impact was not so bad. If you see anything recent , please let me know.

"Bronia we do have lots of private jets coming to the island and as I shared earlier the PM said some approved flights will be allowed into the island. He stated that in a press conference today that people requiring urgent medical need and businessmen are allowed into the island but must follow strict quarantine protocol ie. 5 days pcr test and 14 days quarantine. He also mentioned that we haven't opened our borders yet and they're still working on a reopening plan as there's an increase in demand to visit the island. So I would say the quarantine rules you mentioned wont apply to tourist yet unless you plan to come to the island at this very moment in time.Please note that the written article doesn't mention everything that the PM saidhttps://translate.google.com/translate…Edited: 11:05 am, July 29, 2020 "
"Re the re-opening of the borders, the Prime Minister indicated that the government is still in discussion and reflection:“ It's complicated, because we have to consider on the one hand the employment sector, the reported currencies, and on the other hand, public health. We must minimize the risk of contamination when passengers return to Mauritius, whether Mauritians abroad, residents and tourists, ”he explained.According to him, given that Mauritius is “Covid safe ”, the country is a very popular destination. "" We are not at the stage of saying that the government will make a decision anytime soon, "" he added. https:/…Until then they are concentrating on export business to get foreign currency. Note the MUR is depreceating.Ash I must have missed that bit in the video where he mentioned business men can come to the island and medical tourists.I read the other day that the AFD (French Development Agency) is lending 300 million euros to Mauritius to finance various projects, in particular the Wage Assistance Scheme.Edited: 11:40 am, July 29, 2020 "

"well ive given up and cancelled, even if its open in september i believe the testing regime will be to o much for me, probably at least 3 or 4 tests before/during and leaving"
So those foreign nationals are making movies and that gives them the justification to enter the country while borders are closed. Same thing for those so-called employees of shipping companies. Meanwhile foreign tourists are denied entry and yet they are the people that pour money into the economy. I do not understand the logic. The whole thing stinks of favouritism. It is who you know in government.
Can't say I blame you Stephen.The Mauritius government is dilly dallying again after saying they would make an announcement on borders last week and I'm sure there will be many more people cancelling and opting to go to Greece for instance where everything is much more straight forward.We are off to Athens and Krakow in the next couple of months where at least we know where we stand.Hope you manage to sort a nice holiday out!
"Although It is not looking encouraging at the moment, I will wait until last minute to rearrange my September flight to Mauritius. I think I can foresee where this is all going. On the one hand, it is pointless to open borders if you will quarantine tourists for 2 weeks. They will simply stay away. On the other hand, if you let everyone in without quarantine perhaps there will be a new wave of the virus (I say ""perhaps"")The government seems to have chosen the option of not doing anything or saying anything. I wonder how long the silence will last until they finally realise that there is only one option. That is to open the borders without quarantine and see how things goes."
"I read somewhere (on this forum, which I've been following for months since our initially planned april honeymoon has been pushed back to October this year, thank you Bronia and everyone else, who has been so regularly updating us with news and other useful and helpful information :)), that they were installing COVID-19 test stations inside the airport. Only allowing people in with a very recent negative test result, testing on arrival and testing a few days later (I wouldn't mind 3 days of hotel quarantine, but I would not do it for 2 weeks!) seems like a reasonable thing they could do. But leaving everyone in the dark, tourists and residents alike, will not help anyone.My country has been doing large-scale tests for a while now, testing up to 10.000 people a day and as such, we happen to have a very high number of positive cases in relation to inhabitants and have been blacklisted by several countries, as many say, unfairly, so fingers crossed we will not end on the Mauritius black list come October."
"That's sad news about the staff at St Geran, hope it doesn't happen, because it probably won't be the only hotel staff it will affect."
"The Tamassa of Lux * Resorts & Hotels is finalizing the final preparations for its reopening scheduled for Friday.....The Tamassa, which has adapted to the Covid-19 context, will receive its customers for the moment only on weekends, until normalcy returns.In addition, it should be noted that Tamassa has kept its 300 employees.I like the last sentence there - could it be a swipe at St Geran?https:/…365975I will add Tamassa to the list of hotels which are reopening even if it is only at weekends."
Following!Hope that Mauritius does something like Madeira Island (Portugal) where you can enter only with negative test or you do test on the airport and then you await for result in the hotel. I am a bit afraid if there is restrictions to certain countries since I live in the country with the biggest number of cases per population in Europe (Luxembourg) and some countries had imposed restrictions to us. However the local government is testing all the population and providing free tests when you travel and when you come back from a trip. Hope to be able to discover Mauritius November as planned!Regards

Mauritians are also complaining about the foreign film crew being allowed access to Mauritius when some of their compatriots are still stranded abroad awaiting repatriation.The film crew arrived by private jet after filming in South Africa and another group are expected next week.The PM was questioned in Parliament last Tuesday about three Indian businessmen who arrived in Mauritius July 22nd but did not clarify whilst the Health Minister said that the door was open to economic activities.https://www.lexpress.mu/article/380559/mauri…

"When I saw the press release issued by Voila Hotel , a few days ago , in relation to their precious ""guests"" booked until October 2020, I was somewhat surprised by the tone of the document. It lacked all the diplomacy and PR that you would expect from an hospitality business.Having just visited their website a few minutes ago (www.voilahotel.mu) , I could not believe the pop up that appeared on the main page after a few seconds . It says :-""Voila Hotel, Voila Meetings & Mokaz Restaurant, Bagatell are closed for the exclusivity of a group until early October 2020.Access to the public will be refused during that time frame""Either their english translator does not understand diplomacy or they have decided to put off anyone from staying at the hotel in the future.

Im probably negative, but will have to go again next week :/ Now I can understand more, test is not comfortable at all, via nose and you feel like you have that anther in your brain... since the lockdown was cancelled in Europe it is up to everybody to behave safely but people are reckless or irresponsible."
"Indeed, we need rapid tests but I think every country relies on vaccine now. But according to articles, the best vaccine is from the UK, but you need hundreds of milions vaccines to cover the world so I guess it will be available next year in summer...

Not sure how reliable those tests are. I suspect many false positives and many false negatives. Yet millions of people across the world are losing their livelihood as a result of restrictions put into place on the basis of such test results.I believe tomorrow is the day that Seychelles opens their borders to low risk and medium risk countries. Strangely China Japan and Thailand are included in the low risk category. Let's see what happens in Seychelles in the next few days. Mauritius may take their cue from them.

"Yes Stephen the Greek thing looks much easier. Everyone is second guessing the QR code lol! A two and no test, a 1 and a 0 means you are singled out for a test. The new 4 seems no test either.I was reading about Lufthansa's brilliant testing programme at the airport. Works fine and results in 2-3 hours. If negative no quarantine like other countries. Mauritius could do with that!Ash your link isnt working but will if you go to FB.Looks like an hour long so will watch later. Seems similar to the similar discussion the other day.What were your impressions of the programme?"
Some interesting points raised Bronia reason we have been able to keep our border closed is because the tourism industry represent only 10% of the GDP. Another interesting point mentioned is to open the border to business tourism- meaning people who can work remotely can be granted longer visas. But the main point raised by a former minister of tourism is a rumoured opening date of 2nd of September. Other than that there’s nothing much to add in this discussion
"Thats what I was hearing too.Another reason Mauritius is able to keep its borders closed is the huge loan the French has given Mauritius which will go towards paying wages:Mauritius receives 300 million-euro loan from French Development Agency:Port Louis, Mauritius (PANA) -Mauritius has received a loan of 300 million euros from the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) to help the island strengthen its capacity for the reduction and management of risks of natural and health disasters.https://www.panapress.com/Mauritius-receives…https:/…202007280445.htmlIn fact I mentioned it on this thread a few days ago. From my post #624 29th July this thread:""I read the other day that the AFD (French Development Agency) is lending 300 million euros to Mauritius to finance various projects, in particular the Wage Assistance Scheme.""I got the impression that they want to attract rich people who can take long vacations in Maurititus and work remotely?Plus business tourism?I didnt get the impression that they were too fussed about the ordinary tourists.Didn't they say they would like Mauritians abroad and residents to visit? Not repatriations?Edited: 1:03 pm, July 31, 2020 "
About Mauritian living abroad they would be treated same as tourist unless they make a repatriation request. The loan will be used for the upcoming budget and other projects according to Dr. Renganaden Padayachy the minister of finance. The assistance wage scheme is being supported by the Government with the help of the BOM which injected $3.5bn for that purpose. The downside of this scheme will likely see a rise in taxes in the foreseeable future
Autopsy report for the person who died in quarantine says that he died of heart attack. Also more details have emerged of the people staying in Voila hotel. They’re a crew of 13 in total from the UK they were granted permission after a request was made to the government to allow filming for a movie by a uk production house. They’ll undertake all cost for their quarantine stay including paying for their pcr test and Hotel. More details in the link belowhttps://www.lexpress.mu/article/380612/quara…
"L'express is right to continuing questioning the government on the case of the film crew. I find all the explanatins given so far difficult to swallow .

He compares Mauritius with its competitors and also other island nations who have either set dates or reopened already and looks at the social and economic consequences of the border closure.One or two paragraphs:The indecision of the authorities will end up being criminal. The BoM press release announcing “ equity / quasi-equity” instruments available within the MIC dates from May 22. It was ten weeks ago already. As of today, the tourism sector has had no income for 21 weeks, except for a few conversions to quarantine centers, special offers to locals, or a few private jets of the well-off. We can estimate this 'hole' at some Rs 25 billion in income already. Each month of indecision will cost Rs 5-6 billion more. While we are floundering in indecision, our direct competitors are already welcoming tourists or have already specified the date of reopening to tourists (2). Maldives, Jamaica, Cuba, Bahamas, Barbados, Bali (11/09), Bermuda, Costa Rica (01/08), Dominican Republic, Egypt, Tahiti, Guadeloupe, Kenya (01 / 08), Mexico, St Lucia, Seychelles, St Maarten, St Vincent, Tunisia, Turks & Caicos, Dubai, the Virgin Islands and almost all of Europe are already displayed.

The editorial by Philippe Forget of L'express about the indecision of the government and the consequences sums it all up. It is becoming blatantly obvious that the country cannot remain shut down while competiting countries open theis borders. The editorial also mentions the major economic damage already sustained. I think we will see the Mauritian borders opening in early September. That would be the only face-saving option for the government.

I am watching closely how the scenario unfolds. It is becomming like a soap.We now have the supreme court case on 15th October ; with the Prime minister suing for defamation over a newspaper article that he planned the lockdown around the travel plans of his family. Yet we still do not know what the government is planning in relation to opening the borders. The two uncertainties cannot co-exist in my view. This makes me feel that were will see a border-opening announcement very soon

I do not want to pack luggage day to day, then go to tests etc. it is not easy... this whole year is sooo stressing, Im like ""go to the forest for meditation ... LOL"""
Hello Vaclav I have been reading about the UK using a rapid testing gadget which could detect corona in 90 mins. If it proves to be reliable then we could be looking at a border reopening a lot soonerhttps://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-new-t…
Ash - its the UK will have the test not Mauritius?Would Mauritius buy the equipment do you think?
"Hi Ash,that would be amazing, althouth I think that here in the Czech Rep. it won't be available.. IDK... tomorrow 2nd test for corona I hope Im still negative since last week LOL"
Bronia we did purchase rapid testing kit from S Korea and I do believe the government will purchase any rapid testing kit that's reliable and shortens the waiting time. The main reason I believe we're hesitant to open our borders is that PCR test can take days to show if someone has the virus or not- in our case we had people tested positive on their 2nd week of quarantine. So if we have a reliable rapid testing mechanism in place where people can be tested an hour before boarding then I don't see any reason for not reopening our border.
"Seychelles has the right approach. Those who test positive are given the ""holiday-quality isolation"". That means they can enjoy trips and sunning themselves on the beach albeit under supervision and separate from other.Here is how the principal secretary to tourism puts :-The principal secretary of tourism, Anne Lafortune, told reporters that ""the reality is that once a person becomes positive, they need to be isolated. The question stands, are they going to be isolated in the hotel they are in or do we isolate the person in another facility outside the hotel but in a place with comfort.""She said that the decision taken was that it is preferable for a tourist who tests positive to be placed in a separate facility.""This facility will need to be equal to a hotel as these people are here on a holiday and they need a facility that is comfortable so as not to totally ruin their vacation,"" said Lafortune.""We want to give a guarantee to a tourist that when they come, should they test positive during their stay, but is not having any symptoms, the person can continue with their holiday, but they will not be able to mingle with the other people due to risks of transmitting the virus,"" she added.""The above formula is a winner for Seychelles. It means if you are positive but with no symptom you still get to enjoy your hoiday; perhaps even more (no crowds , fewer people on your trips, etc)Edited: 5:13 pm, August 03, 2020 "

"This was discussed in another newspaper the other day and now Defi joins in.Would you visit SUSS island? That's the slogan the authorities have adopted to sell Mauriitus to the world.As the country prepares to revive its tourism industry in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, the Association of Communication Agencies of Mauritius (ACA) has strong reservations about the use of the name of the slogan ""SUS Island ”in communication and marketing initiatives in international markets. This is a concept launched by the Tourism Authority.In a press release issued this Tuesday afternoon, August 4, the ACA maintains that this title was ""ill-inspired"" or simply ""clumsy"" and thus raises many questions about the brand image of the country which may take a nasty blow. Especially since Mauritius is on the blacklist of financial centers in the European Union.Whether in English, French or Creole, the name can lend itself to inappropriate and damaging interpretations, or even suggest crude puns, the statement said.He added that ""if vulgarity is more of a national communication problem, the use of 'sus' can evoke other words, such as 'suspicious' with foreign audiences.""https://defimedia.info/sus-island-mal-inspir…"

"The Tourism Authority of Mauritius appears to be in self-destruction mode.It has been nearly 5 months and still no indication when borders will open. It would be a different matter if the government was keeping people informed. As they are not, it is bordering on the rude and disrespectful. I can understand the french opting for Seychelles. Others will follow.To re-open in 2021 will be a massive blow and Mauritius can forget about being a prime tourist attraction in that part of the world."
"It only takes a few more travel syndicates such as Entreprises du Voyage(which controls 1700 travel agencies) to express their disappointment about Mauritius and we will have the domino effect. Then it is : hello Seychelles , goodbye Mauritius."
"Sorry if I have missed this, but what does SUS island mean or stand for?Of all the things that could attract people to Mauritius, 'SUS' would not be many people's first thought. For the country that acted swiftly and sensible as the outbreak began, they are behaving bizarrely now."
Roaming in the UK it stands for Stop and Search and has negative connotations in many other countries.Mauritius tourist board in it's wisdom has adapted the name to market itself - supposedly means Sustainable Tourism.See above post #696.
"Sadly the ugly word ""Sustainability"" is rearing its ugly head in the world of travel and tourism. That is where SUS comes from. In reality , it is about making Mauritius squeaky clean and tourist friendly. The outcome however will have far-reaching impact which some may not like.It is about image. Already 150 taxi drivers are taking part in a pilot scheme to be ""ambassadors"" for the country. What will follow, in all likelyhood, is the removal of everything considered harmful to the tourist industry(eg street food sellers, beggars, locals who ""dare"" enter hotel grounds or walk on beaches nearby)When sustainabiliy came to my office, a sustainabilily officer was appointed. Since then a dozen rules have come about on how we behave in the office. Same thing will happen to the tourist industry in Mauritius - DOs and DONTs and it is the local people who will be subject to it. Everyone will need a licence to deal with tourists whether they be boat operators, taxi drivers, bungalow owners (bungalow owners already need one and must satisfy some 100 conditions to get on)Edited: 9:16 am, August 06, 2020 "
"Ah, OK, 'SUS' meaning 'sustainable' is ridiculous. No-one knows what it means, whereas everyone here knows it as the Sus stop and search laws. As far as I can see, tourism is a long way from environmentally sustainable in Mauritius - you only have to look at the tankers carrying water to the big hotels to know that water is in short supply for such heavy usage. Plus beyond the more economically restricted members of the local community, the vast majority of food is flown or shipped in. All visitors rely on plastic- bottled water to drink.Initiatives to improve sustainability are appreciated everywhere - and Mauritius has made some. The reduction in cane production will presumably eventually result in less run off into the sea, the reduction of plastic bags in supermarkets - all good. Can't be sanctimonious, I do not live a sustainable life on my home country. But I would think Mauritius has a long way to go before it can use sustainability as an honest marketing strategy, even with a user-friendly name."
"RoamingI also see very little being done to improve the environment. In my view ,it is all about Image - disguised as ""sustainability"". The SUS project has some token environmental goals but they hide the true agenda. The real objective is to double the number of tourists to over 2 million. During the course of this, more beachrfront land will be converted to hotels.It is all about PR; taxi drivers being trained to deal with tourists and told where to take them. Same for tour operators and hoteliers. Various seminars and projects taking place to 'educate' . I fear the tourist will not be able to have an authentic experience of the country in future. Gone will be the days when tourists really mingle with the locals. I still remember , as a child, how my family regularly entertained friends from Italy , France and Switzerland. We took them everywhere and they saw the real life in Mauritius. I also came across people from Europe who had forged relationships with the poorer people of Mauritius and they would stay in the house of those poor people and never be put off by lack of hygiene but they would treasure the experience of the real life.I suppose it is what a holiday means for some. For me, a holiday means meeting the locals and partaking in their activities. For others, it means sitting around the pool and going on regimentally organised tours.Edited: 8:26 am, August 07, 2020 "
Well...still no news about borders re-opening but still hoping to get to Mauritius at some point. My mid-September flight will probably need to be changed. If only the government could give an indication. I am seriously thinking that they do not have a clue what to do.
"Hello,same here, Emirates even wrote us that the flight from Dubai to Mauritius on 31st must be postponed to at least 1st Sep, but IDK about the borders, NOW there is ecological DISASTER in Blue Bay, Mahebourg because some ship is broken down and the oil is leaking OMG :O So they are fighting with this now.. I take it as a sign that I should not come this year... I will postpone it to the next year probably.. PRAYING for Mauritius now.. :("
"The ecological disaster in the Mahebourg area directly affects my holiday. I was meant to stay at a beachfront property in the Mahebourg bay.That ship was never meant to be sailing near the south-east cost of Mauritius. It should have passed hundreds of miles south of the country on its way to Brazil via the southern tip of Africa. Was it dropping something off ?!!!!Edited: 9:20 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Roaming when we lived in Pereybere we had to phone for a water tanker every other day or we had no water.This went on for weeks and was a total pain.Even today there are water shortages and tankers delivering water - just look at the recent press articles.Ecological tourism?Have any of the tourists ever bothered to look at the rubbish left on the beaches after a weekend, or seen the rubbish people dump in residential areas?Its OK hotels saying leave your towel on the rail if you don't want a new one but they really need to address the bigger issues.The new initative after the plastic bag ban is paper cups and plates will be banned soon.Yes, if only we had some indication on when or if they will allow tourists."
"The ship is spilling its own fuel. It was not carrying any cargo. At first it was floating well but trapped by the shallow water and the reefs. Now the hull has cracked , because of the constant battering against the reef over the last two weeks . The goverment is being blamed by the people, the opposition parties and the ecologists for not dealing with the crisis swiftly."
"So are the barriers made by people or gov allright and should protect well from the total disaster ? :O it is about your nature and corals, I hate these ships.."
"Dano the government is blaming bad weather!I think we are on the wrong thread?Edited: 9:36 am, August 07, 2020 "
Absolutely ! wrong thread. This is Lockdown thread. Only wish there was some good news ahead of the weekend
The government surely will have to make a decision soon if the borders are to officially open on 1st September. It's not leaving much time for people wanting to go to the island much time to get their travel plans organised.
"The government's indecision is not only keeping holidaymakers in limbo ; it is also creating a lot of uncertainty for airlines that have already booked passengers on their flights to Mauritius post 31 August . Air France , for example, started to open bookings on flight to Mauritius that leave from beginning of September. Was that done on the basis of the March announcement that"" borders will be closed until 31 August"" or do the airlines know something that we don't ? I do not know about airline regulations and I wonder if they can seek compensation from the Mauritius government should borders not open."
"I agree, I wonder if Airlines do know something, a few Airlines are actually accepting bookings to Mauritius for very early September. It will be unfair to businesses and tourists if something official is not decided very soon."
"We’re theoretically flying there with BA from London on 19th Sept for two weeks and they’re merrily still taking bookings. Frustrating as hotel confirmed today they also expect / hope to be opening on 31st August, but said they’re also waiting for official government communication. They told me to keep looking at airport website which doesn’t mention 31st at all - just “closed to international travel until further notice.” Also frustrating as I owe the full balance for the holiday on 29th August which is obviously before we know we can even get into the country meaning we can’t easily switch to another destination last minute as we’d need to wait for BA to cancel then refund / offer alternative. Plane only looks like it’s sold a small proportion of seats too which also might mean it will be cancelled... :-("

So now is the time to position ourselves again as a select high-end destination and to respond to the demand already expressed by those who have the means ” now is the time to position ourselves again as a select high-end destination and to respond to the demand already expressed by those who have the means.""https:/…https://translate.google.co.uk/translate…If you want to read it in English you will have to see the whole Le Mauricien:"
"I was not impressed by the interview with the ex CEO of Air Mauritius. It was indeed a very long rambling and I did not like the tone.Why does he think Mauritius needs to reposition itself as a high-end destination for the wealthy ? He seems to think that the average european will not be able to afford long distance destination for a long time to come and concludes that opening borders too soon will leave empty shops and hotels. He clearly favours the very rich and has disdain for the average european. I don't understand why he has to mention the european, who lives in an appartment, that is stressed because of confinement and who does not have a garden like mauritians do . Can you believe that !!!The length of the interview suggests a carefully prepared article; no doubt reflecting the hidden agenda of making Mauritius a millionaire'a playground."
"Dano I absolutley agree with your observations about Pillay.I recall he was sacked from MK only eight months after being appointed Chief Executive Officer.The gardens observation puzzled me too!He maybe wants to go back to the days when we wouldnt allow charter airlines Dano and courted the so called ""higher end"" market.Someone should tell these people we are now in 2020 and you can't turn the clock back!"
"BroniaLe Mauricien refers to Pillay as :"" Economic observer and experienced administrator"". If there is one thing we do not need at this time of travel frustration, it's for the newspaper to give a platform to an ex CEO who is now clearly an ""ambassador"" for some major player in the tourist industry who favours the country remaining closed.Edited: 8:52 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Hi, I've been following this thread for a while and I've been stuck in mauritius for quite some time. Due to an emergency situation, I need to get out. I've found a confirmed flight soon but they need a Covid test for travel. Anyone know where to get the test done from and how long it will take to get the results? My flight is on Friday night (14th Aug)."
hi  I was wondering whether a foreigner can travel to mauritius on one of the repatriation planes if there are seats available n if he pays for his ticket. Any contact number or email.
No.Why are you thinking of asking?
We are due to fly on September 5th for our 25th wedding anniversary. We have had no real confirmation from anyone except that borders due to open September 1st. The hotel has not replied to my email and my brother is flying from Belfast so it's all getting a little frustrating!
Sorry but there has been no official statement as to when the borders might reopen. The September date is assumed because several airlines are supposedly resuming flights then but it is not officailly confirmed.The lack of information is frustrating for everyone.Which hotel are you staying?
We are staying at Beachcomber Victoria. Let's hope there is an official statement soon. Thanks for the reply.
Last I heard they were still using Victoria for repatriated quarantined Mauritians.You could try sending them a message on Facebook?I will see what I can find out later.
Thank you so much. I will also try messaging them via FB
We have had an Email from Emirates today. Our holiday has been cancelled as the Mauritius border will be closed until 30th September. Sorry folks no idea if that means they will be open on 1st October.
Apparently it is also UK not on the travel list. I have no idea if that will carry on .
"Thanks for the update Denise, I was already about to cancel and book somewhere else. I will now wait until I get the same confirmation as you as I do not want to go to Mauritius due to the indecisiveness of the borders."
"Same here, maybe we will try not Sep but May like you, the weather should be ok as well, but second thing is how they handle with the ecological disaster, the whole day trips to Ile Aux Cerfs, Aigrettes was so popular and wanna go again in May but there is so much oil :( I watch all the news and have photos of that ship which soon maybe break in half :( Meantime, only France promised help... it breaks my heart because I love this place..."
"I really don't know the ins and outs of it all Bronia, Maybe Emirates took the decision as the Mauritius goverment hav,nt."
"Hi Vaclav, it is very sad to see all the videos and photos of the oil spill. With the help of the ecologists and nature it will be beautiful again one day. We have been to Mauritius in May before, we have visited many timesThe maurian people are so kind and helpful. Love the country."
Well I am able to do mock bookings for first week in September for EK and Turkish. Not tried BA or MK yet Denise.None of them should be accepting bookings.Why nothing from the Mauritius government?If they are not opening borders until October they should have the decency to announce something and not leave it up to the airlines.
I’ve just tried with BA and can still book an outbound flight direct for 31 August.
Thanks MavenChar.Just tried Air Mauritius (MK) and nothing bookable until 2nd October.Either MK knows something none of the other airlines do or EK TK and BA are accepting bookings knowing they won't happen.
Also air France taking bookings and I see they are still flying via reunion.
That sounds suspicious on the governments side. I hope they warned all the hotels.
"I have not heard anything from Air France and my booking is for mid-september.However, I must say that the fact Air Mauritius does not accept booking until 2 October (as per Bronia's post) is very telling."
We were due to fly September 5th with BA . Travel agent rang Beachcomber and they confirmed they were cancelling due to non conformation of border opening.
"I have BA flights departing mid October. Wondering what to do given the lack of guidance from the Government. The Government would serve it's country better by discussing its options more openly. This Forbes article is a good read regarding the tanker disaster. Shows how slow the response was and the lack of planning should such a disaster ever happen. That side of the island receives the wind which is strong at this time of year which is why bad weather is a near certainty, despite being reported as being unfortunate or unlucky in some why. It's the high season for the windsurfers and kitesurfers for a reason.https:/…Does anyone know the amount of notice the hotels would need to be ready should the borders open?"
"Hello,yes, I was there last year in the middle of Sep and the weather was fantastic, 23-25 degrees, but it felt warmer, absolutely no humidity, maybe after rain but it rained only once, so it was like in my country, the ocean was warm for me as well, I hope May should be the same, maybe warmer little bit... I fell in love with this island, there was such a peace and ease and tranquility you know what I mean? The people always smiling, no worries, I returned totally calm LOL :) It became my heart thing you know."
"hi, please advise. What happens if there is a 14 day quarantine and I am only staying a one hotel for 3 nights at the begining of my trip to mauritius in October 2020?"
"Then it wouldnt be worth going to Mauritius.Besides, no one knows what the government protocol will be as they arent discussing it with the general public.So we have to sit tight and wait - yet again!As we have said it would be helpful if some communications were given by the government, even some indication of when and if the borders may open and if so to whom."
"Have been watching from the sidelines as we were due to fly out BA on 29th September, just contacted Best@ who we tend to book through to be advised that the flights have been cancelled. Was only looking on the BA site last night flights still showing, today they have disappeared and no communication from BA at all.Option from Best@ was full refund, try to book somewhere else or same deal next year. Think we will opt for transferring to next year at no extra cost.Something to look forward to....as long as the world does not go crazy again. Best@ assured me that they are covered by a abta if anything goes wrong.I hope anyone who is going later in the year gets away, will be thinking of you.See you next year Mauritius!"
We have had the offer from the hotel to honour this year's prices and offers but BA have increased fare by around £500 per couple! Not such a great deal.
Just tried mock bookings again with EK and TK and able to see early September flights still.Exploration that's bad of BA.When we changed our flights with TK from June to December there was no fare increase at all but the hotel which we booked independently won't budge on prices. OK the prices for December are more than in June but in general hotel prices are lower now so am disappointed in them.Can you not ask your travel company to change carriers?
"You're between a rock and a hard place Exploration. Hope things will work out eventually.Repatriations continue apace:21 Mauritians on board MK 852 will disembark at Plaisance airport at 6 p.m Thursday, August 13. O 12 are from Lesotho, 2 from Malawi, 4 from Zimbabwe and the remainder, 103, are from South Africa.According to our cross-checks, two Mauritians who were ready to be repatriated from Johannesburg, tested positive for Covid-19. Suddenly, they were removed from the passenger list. All passengers undergo PCR testing prior to boarding repatriation flights.https://defimedia.info/des-mauriciens-en-pro…There also appears to be a Paris flight to Mauritius tomorrow with MK:https:/…arrivals"
Hope everyone gets their issues sorted and you all get to visit Mauritius eventually.
"Just checked BA site. No direct flights in September now. There is weekly flight via Seychelles or flights via South Africa. Direct flights start Oct 1st with BA similar to Air Mauritius. Let's hope these don't have to be cancelled.If my kids end up back on online schooling, what I wouldn't give for us to be Mauritius. As another contributor said, one of the best of things about the Island are the people."

"First it was just indecision on the part of the government .. Now it is becoming a farce. What we are seeing is an inability to take action . Not knowing what to do , they just go quiet and hope the problem will go away. We saw that with the shipwreck as well.The experts that came to deal with the ecological disaster are being treated as a health threat despite reassurance from their negative Covid test results. They deserve to be treated better. It is time to get practical. The government need to show flexibility and act proportionately. There are no active cases of Covid currently in Mauritius and hospitals are not under pressure. It is the right time to ease the restrictions a bit and see how it goes. There are other countries that are shut down with no news but ,unlike Mauritius, they are not countries where tens of thousands of people had planned to travel to for holidaysl, weddings , etc."

It is like the goal post being moved constantly. First control of Covid is achieved but that is not enough. Now there is talk of second wave. Then there will be talk of the third wave.. and so it will go on.Meanwhile some countries have shown more initiative and practicality. For example the Maldives currently have tests only for those with symptons. No PCR required to enter the country if you have no symptoms. Seychelles , as we know, opened its borders on 1 August. There are some restrictions in Seychelles such as necessity to book in an approved hotel (same in Maldives) and PCR test. Otherwise they are pretty easy-going.The longer Mauritius keeps its border closed the more damage will be done to its economy. It is not a question of a second wave of Covid being disastrous to the country; it is more a case of anti-covid measures bringing disaster. Then we get a crippled economy (and let's not forget the financial blacklisting curently in force) and the country goes to the World bank and gets its hands and feet tied.Edited: 8:58 am, August 18, 2020 "
"Regarding the Wakashio, there I was hoping to do some diving in the area to see if there was anything dumped into the sea (apart from the oil) which would explain why the ship changed course and headed directly for the island."
"*He also emphasized that the government didnt appreciate foreign press reports which he thinks denigrates Mauritius*Mauritius needs serious PR advice.As a nation, Mauritius could be enjoying the kind of praise and profile the NZ is getting - the country acted very quickly and effectively, put in excellent systems very quickly, and although I recognise it is harder on a bigger scale, I would have loved to have seen the UK Gvt at as quickly and decisively as Mauritius at the start of the COVID crisis. The food deliveries to households, the alphabetical access to shops, the stopping of flights, and quarantining, and more. They could have got far more international kudos with a PR campaign, and letting other countries know how few deaths they experienced, and sharing good practice.uBt the current dithering , the ridiculous 'SUS' proposal, and the apparently shameful response to the tanker disaster have undermined all that.Again - they could have been loud and proud all over the world about their citizens efforts 'while waiting for the world's help', sending footage of the volunteer clean up to the BBC etc as soon as it started. It would have captured the heart of the world, and brought much sympathy for the government.Instead they seemed to almost keep it hush hush and trying to keep volunteers away, etc, trying to suppress the truth, sating the images were fake etc.They are a PR disaster - so not fair to blame to world's reports."

"A 22-year-old, placed in quarantine in a hotel in Belle-Mare, (Ambre) went off to meet his relatives on the beach Tuesday August 18, around 8 p.m.The man flew from London via Dubai to Mauritius on August 14. Still in quarantine, he left his room to meet his mother and his cousin on the beach not far from the establishment.In the early hours this morning, three relatives of the young man were placed in a quarantine center as a safety measure. An investigation was opened for violation of the Quarantine Center Act. He was reported by the doctor at the Ambre.https://www.lexpress.mu/article/381482/quara…https:/…Meanwhile Tourmag.com magazine asserts that the authorities indecision in reopening the borders harms tourism more than covid.The boss of Exotismes in Marseille (which sends at least 20,000 French tourists each year to Mauritius) said the continued closure of the Mauritian borders ""suggests that the epidemic is not really under control in Mauritius, that the country does not manage to have a safe health framework and that therefore the government may even be hiding things ... ""Interesting comments!He added that the Maldives and Seychelles are taking the high-end leadership in the Indian Ocean and the bankruptcy of Air Mauritius only added to the doubts of potential tourists who fear either seeing their ticket canceled at the last moment or not being able to return to France promptly in the event that MK's flights cease. .https://www.lexpress.mu/article/381491/reouv…"
"The boss of Exotismes echoes what I have been saying already about Seychelles and Maldives taking the lead. I agree totally with his comments about the government ""hiding things"". There comes a point when all the hidden stuff will come out."
"Hello everyone,the whole thing is terrible and weird. As it was mentioned before today, Seychelles or Maldives both have plans for tourists because they need them and only this paradise island does nothing.... but this is an epic fail of the government, what else we can say, locals need tourists , I wonder how long will it take them to understand that economy needs borders to be reopened ASAP !!!!!! I wonder how the government is able to pay those who are at home but would work in a hotel or in turism.. that ecological tragedy even makes it worse.You fill Mauritius on GOOGLE and see only tanker with oil :( :/I really hope in May next year, I will spend so much money there for everything with taste, it doesn't matter, to support Mauritius. God really bless them all , it is so hard this year."
"So sad the country is run by someone who likes to work in secret. Decision about the borders appear to have been made and leaked to airlines. However, PM maintains no decision made yet.With the Wakashio incident, we also saw the secretive approach. Instead of sending tug boats to pull the ship away from the reefs , the first act of the government was to immediatetly create a no go zone within a kilometre of the wreckage and then do absolutely nothing for two weeks."
"From today's Defi:The Mauritian borders have been closed since mid-March 2020. The question of reopening is still debated and no date has been finalized to date. However, the period late September / early October seems to suit the government. The priority, one source suggests, remains the safety of the population.The rest of the article is behind a pay wall (again!)https://defimedia.info/covid-19-vers-louvert…On the subject of repatriation 188 employees of the Royal Carribean were repatriated today on a flight from London.To date, eight repatriation flights have been carried out and a total of 1087 members have been repatriated.

I don't think It has anything to do with the safety of the population given that everybody entering the country can be tested. It is not as if tourists would be entering through a backdoor without any tests.The government already admitted their big agenda of repositioning Mauritius as a high-end destination and using the closed borders as an opportunity reassess everything . Perhaps introduce new laws and licences to effectively dictate who can and who cannot provide services to tourists. All this takes time to organise.

Should the border be still closed, I will be able to change again.Meanwhile , I will be spending the time doing more water sports on the UK's south coast and get beach-ready for my trip to Mauritius if and when it happens."
"This reinforces what I suggested may happen yesterday re repatriation and possible border reopening:The government has decided to move up a gear regarding the repatriation of Mauritians stranded abroad.Once this stage is completed, the authorities will be able to approach the next stage - namely the reopening of the borders.The government is therefore proposing to repatriate 2,800 Mauritians over the next three weeks, we learned from official sources.Social distancing on planes will no longer be practiced as all passengers must take a PCR test before being allowed to board. Consequently, the number of passengers by plane will drop from 150 to 300.Arrangements have been made locally with hotels to increase the quarantine capacity.Responding to the opposition leader's PNQ on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Steven Obeegadoo made it clear that the government's current priority remains the repatriation of Mauritians stranded abroad. "" The opening of the borders will be considered as soon as the creation of a laboratory at the airport has been completed, "" he said. Which, according to the Prime Minister, will take place in the coming weeks.It should be noted that an Air Mauritius flight as part of repatriation flights arrived in the country this morning with 188 people.https:/…"
"Thanks Bronia for the update. Common sense seem to be coming back and abandoning social distancing on the basis of negative PCR tests was overdue in my view. Doubling available seats on the airplane does speed up things.I mentioned earlier that , although my outgoing flight with Air France on 12th September had disappeared from the system (found out it was cancelled), the return flight on 27 September was still showing. Although irrlevant since I rebooked for October, it does suggests that late September may still be on the cards.

This is what emerges from a press release issued by the Ministry of Health on Monday, August 24.The new case was detected on a 21-year-old young man, who arrived in Mauritius on Sunday August 23 on board the MK015 repatriation flight from Paris.The result of the COVID-19 test carried out yesterday on the 21-year-old young man on his arrival in Mauritius was found to be positive even though he had been found negative on the PCR test before leaving France.According to the Ministry of Health, the condition of the asymptomatic patient (who has no visible symptoms) is considered stable. He was transferred to ENT hospital in Vacoas.According to the latest figures from the ministry, Mauritius has recorded 347 positive cases for COVID-19 and 10 deaths. 335 patients were cured of the disease.The total number of COVID-19 tests undertaken so far is 225,362, including 65,047 PCR tests and 160,315 rapid antigen tests. 971 passengers are accommodated in the various quarantine centers.https://defimedia.info/breaking-news-covid-1…What I don't get is these imported cases test negative before boarding the plane and this has happened in London, SA and now Paris?

If Mauritius really does adapt this protocol outlined above then they will definitely lose tourists.Not many can afford to stay for 3 weeks or more and spend 2 of those weeks locked in their hotels.I know I wouldnt bother.

We’re due to fly 2nd Oct - still no idea what is happening. We only have 2 weeks so quarantine would be the deal breaker - we wouldn’t get to do or see anything!
"I agree Bronia. They will lose tourists if they adopt that protocol. It is complete nonsense. There is no guarantee for the tourist that they will be able to enjoy the holiday after two weeks quarantine. We are seeing too many cases of negative PCR before embarkation and positive when landing. They should do as Seychelles do; give a guarantee that, even if tested positive, they will still enjoy the holiday and be allowed out but in isolation. Also, as in Seychelles, there should be no automatic quarantine upon landing.The tourist industry in MRU will suffer irreparable damage and so will the economy. Yet, the peddlers of doom and gloom who seem to have poisoned the minds of politicians around the world will get away with it."
Six new cases of corona detected. The infected people were all repatriated from India and were in quarantine when they were tested positive. They have since been transferred to the new ENT hospital for further treatment bringing the total number of active cases to 9.https://translate.google.com/translate…
This is disheartening as we’re booked for November for 10 nights. How do you read this for tourists holidaying for less than 2 weeks?

Thanks for the update Bronia. Let’s hope they make a decision soon so people can adjust any plans.
"Exactly Amy - wish they'd get a move on!Other countries have tourist protocols in situ which arent so draconian with no real problems.OK they are worried about reintroducing covid to Mauritius but they really can't keep borders closed indefinitely.Other countries do not impose quarantine once you have a negative result either - ie Greece springs to mind offhand.I would think its also a money spinner for the Mauritius government if they need more than one test as cannot imagine for one second they will offer free tests to tourists!Also it would encourage AI packages if no one is allowed out so no money going into the local economy, only to the hotels."
"I was wondering Bronia if you had heard anything about what countries will be let into Mauritiuswhen it opens its borders. I ask because when Emirates cancelled our holiday, it said the border was closed ,also the UK were not allowed entry into Mauritius."
Just checked Turkish Airlines who were scheduled to resume flights once a week to Mauritius in September and now seems to have no flights to Mauritius at all in September:https:/…
Mock bookings show no flights available until 2nd October with TK and 2nd October with MK.So we can probably count September out as well.
BA also have a flight scheduled to depart 1 Oct and land on the 2nd
My booking is for 1 oct with air mauritius via paris. It is not yet cancelled by travel republic but i am assuming it will be. Sad !
"I notice on some package sites (eg love holidays) there are flights bookable from 14 September. Obviously this could change, but it seems travel companies have more information than we do!We’re travelling in January 2021 and are still hopeful at the moment but we trust that an announcement will be made in good time so that alternative plans can be made if required. At the moment we’re just waiting to see what, if anything, is announced on 1 September."

"There was a big march today in Mauritius with the protesters accusing the mauritian government of incompetence. What is happening with MRU borders is that the government is incapable of making a decision. They have already proven that they cannot decide. The latest information coming out is that they are looking at the possibility of opening borders for tourists who stay for more that 14 days (because the first 14 days need to be spent locked up in a quarantine hotel).They are watching how Coved19 pans out around the world. In fact they said so many times. I have re-booked my September flight for mid-October but I am not holding out much hope. By the time the borders open fully and lockdown is over, there will be so much dissent among the populace. Not just Mauritius but the world over. So many industries have been dealt a terrible blow - Aviation, Retail, hospitality and many more. Billions of people have had their dreams and aspirations quashed.

I hope that they spend the next two months making preparations to open fully from November. Would be disappointed if they open the borders but with lots of limitations. Within the next two months they can finalise testing and procedures etc and the tourist industry can prepare itself.

More from Bronia's post following a press conference from the Prime Minister right nowThe reopening will be done in 3 phases.• Phase 1 is the repatriation of stranded Mauritians across the world till the 30th of September• Phase 2 is the partial reopening of our borders on the 1st of October to selected countries only- Initially only Mauritians living abroad and residents will be given priority to come to the island. Tourists from selected countries will be able to make their booking for flights and hotel online but will have to follow strict sanitary measures- I believe more info is required on this one.• Finally phase 3 the reopening no fixed date has been decided yetThe prime minister also talked about the protest following the Wakashio tragedy which I’ll post in the tanker thread
https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/…The speech is here.
"Well.. here we go again. Need to rebook again.They say there are active 10 positive cases. Chances are all will recover. Did I say ""will recover""? How can you recover if you do not even have symptoms.There is a lot of unrest in the country at the moment. Whilst the large protest of saturday 29th August may have been triggered by the Wakashio disaster , it was clearly more about the general incompetence of the government and the way it behaves as a dictatorship. The message to the government from the protestors was ""pick up your bags and go""!"
"Hi All, According to some local papers , borders will be closed until the 31st of October , there is apparently some notification from NOTAM in regards to this , see below link https:/…381993I myself got a flight booked for the 9th of October with BA from LGW"
My take on the speech is that it's a reaction to the anti-government marches and he's saying what he thinks the people want to hear to placate them.Nothing new there.
Hi AmyWhy is the uk unlikely to make the list? Is it because of the volume of cases in our country do you think?
Joshua I already posted the Express link and included the info from NOTAM - scroll back a page.Amy I would be surprised if French tourists were allowed in and not the UK as their figures are on the rise and a lot of countries including the UK wont allow people to visit France without quarantining on their return.
Hi Alec - That’s my assumption. I could be completely wrong but I’m not very hopeful! We’ve got flights booked on 2nd Oct so think they will now be cancelled.
Will you be able to rebook? Most countries are looking to accept uk so fingers crossed. We’re travelling in January 2021.
