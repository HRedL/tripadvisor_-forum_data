"President Sanchez ordered the State of Alarm yesterday. It starts on Monday, March 16, and ends on March 30.https://english.elpais.com/politics/2020-03-…This means that restaurants will be closed. Tourists could go to hotel restaurants, which will be open."
"Have you heard what is happening with tourists? I have retired relatives there, not due back for another 3 weeks :( Haven’t heard any update all week about them, hopefully they’re just busy trying to get a flight back to Canada."
That is mentioned in the original post canjun13 - they will have to go to hotels to eat out or simply dine in at their accom - food stores will still be open
".Getting people home is more important than getting a refund, I think we'll agree.Easyjet is trying to get people back who are trapped in Spain.This is more important than me getting my money back from a cancelled flight, or rebooking my next holiday to Spain.So to reduce the traffic on Easyjet's website so that people stuck in Spain can get home andavoiding the Easyjet website crashing, #I'mKeepingEasyjetWebsiteClear.I hope you are too.Best wishes, keep safe.."
Absolutely agreed Turista. I was is this situation a week ago - travelling to Venice airport to see if the early flight home I had booked at my own expense was flying. I would have paid a lot more than I did to get home and have now completed my first week of self isolation.

"The decree is clear. You cannot go out unless to go to work, a supermarket, pharmacy, health facility, to exercise a pet or a few other caring exemptions. These measures are vital to stopping the spread. Walking or driving to a local hotel restaurant is not permitted. You could already be infected and unwittingly spread it to others. This is very, very serious. Please obey the restrictions which say you must stay indoors."
Hope they don't keep extending the lockdown gradually until June as that is when it is supposed to peak!! People will revolt.
So how are tourists getting home...do airplanes continue to leave during lockdowns? If people can get an earlier flight home how do they get to the airport? Are taxi drivers putting themselves at risk?
Turista - I agree of course but I've seen posts from outraged people demanding easyJet buys them a taxi ride. Some people are even still asking if they should go to Spain!Another planet
