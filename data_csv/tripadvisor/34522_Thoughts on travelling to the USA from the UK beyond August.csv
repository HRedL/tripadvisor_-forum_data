Curious if the USA travel ban will be lifted by September as it seems airlines are starting to outline their plans for after summer.Anyone have any flights booked for September?
"We are due to fly to San Francisco at very end of August, returning from Las Vegas two weeks later in September but from US posts it would seem there will be no international flights landing, and Vegas will only be open for domestic customers. Just hope FCO advice is clear enough that flights are cancelled and we can can get a refund. Would prefer not to go until we have been vaccinated...."
"There is no ban on flights. There are trans Atlantic flights landing in the USA every day. Schedules are reduced and not all routes are operational but there’s no ban on flights.Whether non USA citizens and residents who have been in Europe or the UK recently will be allowed entry in the fall is anyone’s guess.Edited: 10:45 am, May 13, 2020 "
Curious if the USA travel ban will be lifted by September - The only person who knows is President Trump.You also have the FCO advice on non essential travel to be lifted.Airlines may plan for flights and some of these will operate but in my opinion I do not see the current restrictions being lifted by September.If the US President lifted the restriction and it led to a significant spike in infections there could be serious political fall out in an election year.Would you be happy to open your borders to visitors from the country with the highest number of covid deaths in Europe.I had to cancel my May 2020 trip to the USA and initially was planning it for Oct 2020 but with all the unknowns I have written 2020 off for all overseas travel.
He doesn't know.There's no advance planning or plans there.
"Yi p - - Easyjet to France, and that's a roll of the dice. There will be many many people with flights to the USA booked for Sept, not many will be expecting to fly, and even fewer would think of booking one at the moment.Re post #1 - - FCO advisory would trigger travel insurance, providing it was taken out before Covid. You'll have to wait and see if the airline cancel the flight or not for a refund."
"wes - all leisure travellers from the UK are banned from flying to the USA currently. This is actually something your president did. The ESTA and visa schemes (with a few exceptions) are both currently rescinded.When and if they will be reinstated is something I am not prepared to predict. I personally do not expect to fly to the USA this year, and am not sure I will travel there in 2021 either, for now. It all depends on far too many things that I don't have any control of or good feelings about. Plus, I happen to be getting poorer by the minute, and there's no sign of that being reversed for now. However, for Brits specifically, there needs to be more than the reinstatement of the ability of Brits to fly to the USA. We also need our FCO's travel advisory to change from categorically stating only essential travel is advised. Without that changing absolutely no UK issues travel insurance would be valid, and you'd need to be a fool to travel to the USA without good travel insurance in place. Further, again in relation to Brits, the UK government has recently warned against citizens expecting or hoping to be able to consider any 'exotic' travel from this summer, meaning to anywhere outside the UK or beyond certain EU countries. And, they will be required on return to the UK to quarantine for 14 days, meaning adding 14 days of leave to the amount needed for the trip. That's going to make it really tough for the employed or those with school/college age kids to travel outside of the UK. All in all, quite a steep slope to climb to be able to visit the USA at the moment, and possibly to the year end.However, I'd love to be proven wrong on this for everybody's sake!SWTEdited: 11:00 am, May 13, 2020 "
"Jackie - what exactly do you mean?I have BA flights for both September and October. Both are on routes that are currently suspended for passenger travel (but neither happens to be for the USA), although Flightaware still shows one route running - presumably freight only. If I go into MMB, my flights both come up as confirmed (and seat ressies showing, too).If I just put the flight number into the BA website, not signing in, none of the flights show up.SWT"
Post 6. 1 European country due to politics. Boris is denying now that this country is now not exempt from the quarantine measures introduced on the back of a fag packet. Brussels are already questioning the legality of it and mid June when Europe opens its boarders again should be interesting.
"Huh?? - - I trust you know what that political rant is about, because it makes no sense to me whatsoever. It also has nothing to do with flying to the USA Not that I can see."
"Re the subject ""Thoughts on travelling to the USA from the UK""There is the ""Are you allowed to?"" versus the ""Do you really want to?""If you book a flight now, and it flies, if you aren't on it you won't be getting your money back, nor will any travel insurance cover a refund. So if you are booking it you better be pretty sure that you will want to be on it, otherwise bye-bye money.The borders into the USA aren't going to go from completely closed to open in one step, I would imagine - I wouldn't be surprised if we see mandatory 14 day quarantine to all arriving passengers be implemented for example.And then there is the question of where in the USA you are going - Some areas have been extremely hard-hit by this (New York City being a banner example), but other large cities are following close behind. There is no telling right now whether some of the states opening up against the advice of the Task force will cause a massive uptick in infections or not we will know that in a few weeks.And of course, the whole issue of going through airports and sitting on planes with a bunch of strangers from who-knows-where in an enclosed space for hours. For some that is an acceptable risk, for others, no so much.I think that there are too many variables right now to really know. For me, as I am in an elevated risk group, I'm not planning on flying anywhere this year. My county in New York State has nowhere near the infections that the major cities have, and I don't want to expose myself any more than I have to."
Anyone traveling outside his or her own country needs to be sure to have medical insurance (or the ability to personally pay) for coronavirus related medical expenses as well as any additional living expenses resulting from a longer than expected stay in another country.
"@post 6 I was really responding to post 1 which specifically mentions a flight ban.And actually UK citizens are not banned from the USA. Entry is banned only for travelers that have been in the UK or Europe within the last 14 days. That makes it tough fir must UK citizens to come here but if you were an expat living in the Caribbean or Australia for example, there no usa law preventing you from visiting.https:/…map-and-travel-notices.htmlI have not seen anywhere that the ESTA scheme is rescinded anywhere. Maybe I missed it."
"https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/First page of CBP's ESTA application form, per link above.Suspension of Entry ..... UK citizens .....While you are correct that technically, a UK citizen who has not been in the UK could enter the USA, they cannot via the ESTA scheme. If you enter what should be a still valid ESTA ref number to check how long it has left to run it tells you it's suspended or rescinded - can't remember exactly which word was used.So, if I had been resident in an allowed country from before the virus started, held a UK passport, and need to fly to the USA, I'd still need to get a visa and there are only certain types of visas being allowed right now. Plus, from something else on this forum in a topic, I read that the department responsible for visa aplications and processing is not currently working. Like American's cannot currently get passports.No doubt, if you have diplomatic service connections and used those channels, things might be different.Anyway, it's all moot. Unless you are willing to self insure, I doubt it makes any sense for anybody to travel to the USA from the UK or as a British passport holder for some time, and then only when lots of official regulations change and tourist attractions, hotels and restaurants fully open up. But that's my view. SWT"
"What I can gather with the ESTA situation is that they will only be cancelled if you attempt to travel to the United states during the travel ban and are not a valid traveler.I have just checked my ESTA and it just says 'Approved' with no mention of a suspension - if we are allowed to travel to the US in September when we go it seems like it would be okay and we wouldn't need to get a new one, unless this is incorrect.The dilemma most people are facing is not booking a trip NOW, it's having already booked a trip BEFORE the virus and are left with a large amount of money lost, or at the very best quite difficult to get back, so most people would probably rather take their trip if restrictions are eased to save losing a lot of money."
