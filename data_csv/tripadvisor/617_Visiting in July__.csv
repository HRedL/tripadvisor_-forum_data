"As with everyone else, all of our travel plans for this summer have been rearranged. My daughter is graduating and as part of her grad trip we were planning to spend 2 nights in NYC. We have no plans for any indoor activities, no shows or museums which will probably be closed anyway. We’ve visited before and done those things. This was just a quick stop of mostly walking around seeing the sights outdoors, Central Park etc. If restaurants are open we’d go, but it’s not a big deal if they’re closed. I’m just wondering peoples opinions on if late July is way too soon even to walk the city?"
The NY Governor has spelled out some specific criteria for places to reopen. It is likely that NYC will be the last part of the state to return to normal. Some types of activities will reopen before others. It is hard to predict what will happen.
"It’s really hard to say. One can certainly walk the city, even now (maintaining distance and wearing a mask). I’ve only been to Manhattan once since this started, for a Dr’s appointment, and it was a bit surreal to see Midtown so quiet...but I go for runs and walks every day in my own Brooklyn neighborhood. You can still appreciate the city, it’s just quieter (and has shrunk to a walkable/bikeable radius). I think the biggest practical concerns for a visitor would be transit (buses & trains for essential workers/business only at this point, no telling how long that will last) and restaurants (you say that’s not a big deal for you, but are you prepared to eat every meal in your room?).I wouldn’t rule out a July visit out of hand, things may be somewhat looser then, but I wouldn’t make any non-cancellable plans, either."
"We were supposed to be there in a few days but had to cancel unfortunately. We were hoping to reschedule for this fall but we are not sure if that’s even promising. Of course we go for the theatre and a museum or two. Of course if your are not interested in those attractions then walking the neighborhoods of NYC is always fun and will be less crowded probably. I’m not sure I would want to go if restaurants, etc. are still closed. Then again the crowds, the noise, and the traffic are all part of the total experience of visiting NYC for us."
"People are out walking the city now, locals that is. So as long as you could get a flight, a hotel room and live with whatever restrictions/limitations the hotel has, plus maybe takeout food, it should be okay, if different than what you're used to."
I would suspect that NYC is the last place to open up within the U.S.A
"I have a mid-August trip still planned. Watching every day to see how easing goes, but since my kids say NYC would be fun to walk around and we prescheduled 2 walking tours (and 1 Broadway show), I'd be in just to see somewhere new.Since I have allergies, I'm bringing my own food, and we have a timeshare stay (that will actually be the big reason we'd cancel - if the resort won't be open), so cooking is no issue (now one of the 2 walking tours is a food tour, but, if we can't eat, we'd still like to see the area we're touring, since we picked 2 different areas for walking:). And we were never planning the Subway, but we're walking and Ubering...so, I'm staying hopeful."
"Thanks for all the responses, I’m feeling better about our plans. We’ll only be there 2 nights so I think we should be ok. We do typically take the subway to get around. If that is not an option are Uber’s still operating? We used them a few times last summer in NYC. We arrive at Penn Station and our hotel is in Times Square. Then we fly out of LaGuardia. As long as we can use Uber from Penn Station and to LaGuardia we should be fine. I was really surprised to see the cheap hotel prices for NYC!!"
"Ubers (and I assume taxis as well) are still operating. The issue with mass transit is the need to keep it accessible for essential workers who need to get to their jobs...there have been some horrifying pictures of crowded conditions on a few subway lines, so it’s kind of a moral issue: if everyone starts hopping on the subway, it puts the people who *have* to take it at even greater risk. But everything continues to evolve, so who knows what the situation may be in a couple of months."
If the restaurants aren't even open for table service by then to me that would be a sign that tourists shouldn't be visiting NYC. The city doesn't need more people at a time of socially distancing and I think looking at the status of the restaurant industry would be a good indicator since if they are allowed to open up for table service then that means social distancing has been relaxed a fair bit. I would stay off the subways. Some people have no option but to use them for work. In very general terms I wouldn't recommend New York in the summer. Its not very pleasant and much less so if many air conditioned places you would normally be able to stop in are closed.
"With the guidelines Cuomo has announced, I don’t think that NYC will be open again by July."
"Re #6 I would not count on your walk-in tours operating. Also, I am 99% sure your Broadway play will be canceled. So you need to come up with other things to amuse yourselves."
"I'll wait to make new plans til I see what's around and if/when Broadway refunds me (since I'll want the cash refund if the play doesn't run)...I have more things than I can fit in 3 days...so if the resort is open, I'm sure I'll find 3 days worth of things to do, even if it's switching things up:). Before, I was cutting things based on no time...now, I'll just cut things based on open vs closed...but I won't decide til early August, b/c every week seems to bring something new...and this week seems to be the week many, many places are starting the process of reopening, which I didn't expect would happen this soon even 2 weeks ago...so, who knows what 3 months will bring..."
I don’t think there is any chance you will be visiting in July...... sorry
"I love tourists. I love the energy of people visiting the city.But with the need to continue to social distance, there just isn't enough space, too many businesses are still trying to adjust, restaurants will be unable to have the same capacity...please don't come in July. We are just not going to be ready in 8 weeks."
"I love New York City and have gone for a week once a year for the past seven or eight years. I love the hole in the wall restaurants and bars, theater, live music (including that in subway stations), just walking around, and most of all the sheer energy of the place. I love the initial moment arriving, coming up onto 7th Ave from the depths of Penn Station, and having the city slap me across the face in a blare of noise, lights and crowded sidewalks. And I just cancelled this year's trip which was to be on early November. I don't think this will be close to over by then, although we may have a better picture. But July? No way.Cancelling November was a selfish decision, I don't think a lot of what I love about being in New York will be open, the little, crammed, wonderful restaurants, theater, live music bars (I'm talking about you, Red Lion), and, absent a vaccine, I think I'd be fearful of them even if they were open.I will miss my trip to New York, in many ways it is always the highlight of my year, and I look forward to returning when this is all behind us.I love New York, and New Yorkers, who, despite their undeserved reputation, are generally friendly, open, and helpful. Just keep moving with the flow on the sidewalks and know what you want before you get to the counter.Edited: 5:56 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"According to the NYC Mayor, he doesn't think NYC itself will be completely reopened until September (if there is no second wave). But, that should include Broadway and larger concert venues. However, this means that it should partially be reopened in July or definitely by August. Keep in mind, hotels are not supposed to be reopened until Phase 3 (which is the same phase restaurants and bars are to open). Therefore, end of July may be plausible, I am thinking August may be your best potential bet. Either way, make sure any travel reservations you make are refundable.Note, neighboring state of CT is to reopen a lot of businesses at once around May 20, which could put more pressure on NY to keep up with them, to avoid a surge of people traveling to CT. It will be interesting to see what happens.Edited: 10:26 pm, May 09, 2020 "
I've cancelled my planned visit for July this year. Covid-19 is still raging with a significant number of deaths everyday.
"The problem is that many deaths are being marked as COVID, even if you actually died from something else. If you tested positive for COVID, but got hit by a car, they will still count it as a COVID death. The number of deaths related to COVID is extremely manipulated. I know people who work in hospitals. Its the truth. So, do not go by death rate. The NEW infection rate in particular regions are what you need to focus on. Currently, NYC is now in a LOW transmission infection rate according to the Mayor last week. However, NYC is not expected to be fully reopened until September, but slow reopening of certain industries are expected to start in June (as of now).Edited: 11:09 am, May 11, 2020 "
"18 - ""If you tested positive for COVID, but got hit by a car, they will still count it as a COVID death.""Do you have any respectable fact based resources, not some second or third hand gossip/rumors, for that claim? Are they testing all accident victims for Covid wherever you live? https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/politi…"
"Yes, read the second paragraph section of this webpage, directly from the CDC itself. It clearly says that data includes ""PROBABLE deaths"". This means the death count includes UNCONFIRMED Corona deaths. The protocall is that IF someone tested positive for COVID dies, that death has to be listed as COVID related no matter what. You can go through all the CDC guidelines for certifying a death and educate yourself on this. https:/…tech_notes.htm"
"20 - Your link also saysCause-of-death classification and definition of deathsMortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (4).Coronavirus disease deaths are identified using the ICD–10 code U07.1. Deaths are coded to U07.1 when coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 are reported as a cause that contributed to death on the death certificate. These can include laboratory confirmed cases, as well as cases without laboratory confirmation. If the certifier suspects COVID-19 or determines it was likely (e.g., the circumstances were compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), they can report COVID-19 as “probable” or “presumed” on the death certificate ""Can you please direct me to a resource that explains the criteria for for a certifier to determine ""the circumstances were compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty"" and whiich could include a car crash victim as a presumed covid death? Thank youEdited: 1:48 pm, May 11, 2020 "
"FYI,The WHO has lost all credibility months ago. As soon as I saw you reference WHO, I dismissed everything you said. The WHO is highly corrupt, has provided false info about this to the US from the very beginning, and ultimately responsible for this virus entering our country in the first place since they failed to properly warn US officials in time. The US is no longer providing any funding to the WHO for this reason. Regarding someone being positive and dying in a car accident....if you look through CDC guidelines regarding how to cerify COVID deaths, it says that ALL presumed/UNconfirmed cases must be marked as COVID. Therefore anyone who has COVID that dies, gets certified as a COVID death."

"The ONLY amusement was the reference to The WHO, a proven unreliable source. Furthermore, the articles I just posted prove that I am correct and come directly from Dr. Birx herself!"
"***Government classifying all COVID patient deaths as COVID, regardless of cause!***If you look at the NYC daily Covid-19 deaths, you see something that supports the above:https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pd…As of May 8, there have been a total of 14,482 Covid-19 deaths in NYC, but if you look at the numbers, 93 deaths are from No Underlying Conditions. The majority of deaths are from those with Underlying Conditions, did any of those underlying conditions contribute to their death, likely in my opinion. Look at California, half of their deaths come from nursing homes:https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/…https:/…SNFsCOVID_19.aspxIt's obvious that people who are unhealthy are at risk in general, add a virus like Covid-19 and you have a potential death sentence. Nursing homes and hospitals can be dangerous places, especially for those with disease. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/20…https:/…index.htm"

"Here we go again -- just as ""there was no Holocaust"" now we have ""there is no COVID"" or maybe ""almost no COVID."". There is a lead story on this and all the crazy nutcases involved in it in today's New York Times. It is well worth reading -- you will learn more than you thought possible about where Fox News gets its disinformation.There is widespread belief no. of cases in China was wildly underreported because hospitals were so overrun many people were sent home, where they later died of what appeared to be pneumonia, so that is what went on death cert. absent absolute proof to contrary. Then there were the alleged satellite images of alleged mass burial pits, mass cremations, etc.A similar thing started happening in NYC, where people with mild symptoms were sent home. At the same time, in early to mid April, NYC ambulance crews were picking up 8 -10 times their normal loads of people who died at home (about 200 a day, compared to 15 - 25 a day).It got so bad they had to get National Guard to go around picking up bodies. Some of these died of other things -- stroke, heart attack, suicide, etc., but obviously some must have been related to COVID. When little testing was available there was nothing they could do about it. As testing became available they DID test. Maybe some people who died of ingrown toenail have been miscategorized as COVID because they tested positive, but it is likely a small number in the scheme of things.Could you just go back to ranting that this is no worse than regular flu, more die of regular flu, etc.?"

"Come. I’m in NY now. We walk around. Bike. Just put a mask on and keep distance. Many restaurants are open for takeout. You said that you are interested in walking, so you’ll be fine. In fact, you’ll enjoy the city without most tourists. And to some other posters... There’s no specific day for things to “open.” Places are getting open. Just gradually."
"Very true IVK, and thanks for bringing us back on topic. NYC is at a very low transmission rate right now and generally safe. Places are open for take out. Hopefully, they will be able to allow dining outside at least in the near future. But I dont think anything else will reopen until late into June. I also believe Hotel reopening isn't until Phase 3, yet others have said that some are already reopened."
"Places are not 'getting open'. The pause order is still in effect and has been extended to June for NYC. Who knows what the situation is in July, but most people walking around right now are certainly not doing so for tourism. Its usually people who need to go to the store, work or get some exercise. https:/…reopen-coronavirus-nyc-testing.html"

"The NYC Mayor said last week that transmission is low right now in NYC. It is fairly safe. There has been more people walking around the parks and relaxing on the grass. Yes, many restaurants and bars that were closed are now reopened for take out only. People are getting things to go and enjoying it in the park. Many parks did reopen too, along with streets for pedestrians only. Parts of upstate NY is scheduled to reopen on May 15. Hopefully NYC will follow soon after. But, I dont think hotels are allowed to reopen until Phase 3. If you are planning to visit NYC as a tourist though, I'd wait until it truly starts to reopen. My prediction is hopefully by end of July or early August. But I wouldn't count on any Broadway shows at all this summer."
"I wouldn't count on Broadway, bars, museums, movies, or using the subway until at least the end of August."
"I saw NBC Studio tours are willing to take Aug 1 reservations...so, that's a good sign a lot of tourist sites will be open by then, if not Broadway (this was a big desire from the fam, but I'm not booking it til August - it's easier to buy last minute than try to get refunds:).I also saw the SoL will restart reservations June 1, but they haven't announced for what date those will be for. This is our Broadway back up plan, but again, I'm not gonna buy except last minute b/c my fam wouldn't care about the crown:).So, I have hope, as long as my timeshare is open. As a ""not hotel, but a timeshare"", it may reopen prior to regular hotels, so I have more hope:)..."
"Things are getting open in the sense that some restaurants completely shut down in late March. Supermarkets were open 6 hours a day. Then things changed gradually in early April. Restaurants started offering take out a couple of times a week. Every business was different. But now most restaurants in my neighborhood offer take out every day. And supermarket hours are much longer. What’s more, I don’t see long lines outside stores the way they were in early April. So yes, things are getting more open in this sense. Restaurants are doing much better for take out. I’m not referring to high end restaurants. But you can certainly stay in the city and get a wide range of takeouts.Finally hospitals, from personal experience, are not insanely overwhelmed. So if an accident happens today, you can get medical care fairly easy. Which was not the case in early April. So I say things are getting better.Edited: 11:15 am, May 11, 2020 "
"And I even see ice cream trucks as of last week. I wish they disappeared for freaking good, but it’s still a sign that we are moving away from the dark ages of the early spring.Edited: 11:24 am, May 11, 2020 "
"I've noticed some small restaurant/cafe businesses opening up here and there. The grocery stores I deal with are keeping the same hours. Some of the pharmacies have actually reduced their hours since April. Lot of places are still boarded up. There are still lines for the grocery stores if you go during the day, but they are capacity control lines. The number of grocery shoppers is down significantly from the early days. In the end though it all boils down to that the stay at home is still in effect and there are only certain exceptions for going out (ie, to store, pharmacy,exercise, appointments, essential workers, etc). What is not on that list is tourism and its not appropriate to encourage tourists to return to NYC until the government gives the all clear."
"""I wouldn't count on Broadway, bars, museums, movies, or using the subway until at least the end of August."" Museums they may be able to work something out with capacity controls at least for the large museums. Broadway/bars and clubs I'm not sure when those can come back. If you look at what happened in Seoul as an indicator. They opened up the clubs and one guy going to the clubs on a single night led to an outbreak of 86 people and counting. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…"
"Re-schedule the trip for July 2021. If you're aye-okay with ice & snow, consider a visit last week of December into first week of January 2021. It's cold as all get out, but a visit is far more likely then versus in July 2020. That's a dream, imo, and unthinking. Use care and smarts when planning a trip to NYC. Please."
