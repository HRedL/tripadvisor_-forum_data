As most of us probably expected the April 16th entry ban for foreign nationals has been officially extended today until 30th of April
"I’m guessing it will be extended further in weeks to come, I think it will be very unlikely that any of us will get out there this summer"
Onyer where is that posted can't see it anywhere I'm following most government websites
"If you Google it, lots of website are featuring this news.https:/…1786162"

"Yes that is true, there are every evening updates made by the government. And even for domestic flights for instance you have to check in 4 hours before departure. Public transport has been limited a lot, over 65 years old people are not allowed to leave the house at all. There is aid for them, they can ask help by telephone for shopping and getting medications. Speaking for myself, we go only to town (Fethiye) once a week or so now, most shops are closed, restaurants are, cafes etc etc. Also bank opening hours have been limited a lot.Erasta is totally closed.My husband waits is the car and I do the shopping, the fish market is totally deserted and I have been to Migros twice being about the only person there. It is grim, I hope this will come to an end soon! For everyone of course!"
"FJ Fethiye must be the exception then because our local town was deserted when I went in for some essentials, I counted 10 people during the entire journey (excluding the few shop keepers in the places that are still open), Also all the news footage shows similar scenes across the country, including Ankara and Istanbul."
"No Idea , Sue, I was just shocked when I saw that video of Fethiye today."
"You know, as that one person who goes out to film the streets, they all share the same in common, curiosity... that is truly what I think. It is useless to go to town because all Paspatur is closed, most shopps arpound the fish market are closed. The fish market is open but the restaurants are closed (like the rest of the town) Having said that, yesterday it was Tuesday market, the markets are still on, and that does bring a lot of people down to Fethiye. There is really nothing to do in Fethiye, I have been twice in the past 3 weeks, it is very very quiet. But people do need to get out every now and then to get their groceries. Shops are by far not as empty as what I see from the Netherlands and the UK. People are not panic shopping, everything is wrapped up, also fruits and vegetables. And for instance the bus time table from Kaya to Fethiye has been reduced to only 3 buses a day, Faralya has only 2 buses. I am not going to town yet, but in the coming days I will need to go so I will let you know!"
"V.R. I think you need to go to F.B and look at Angel’s post. Town was packed cars double parked as usual, people walking around the pavements. I could not believe it, market day or not, so many cars parked at the town centre well away from the market and it was teaming with rain. So may cars driving around and big queues at the lights. I am not the only one that remarked with shock about this video. Looking at this post of Fethiye and then seeing our deserted streets and empty road here in the U.K. there is a stunning difference. If we go out now we must have a reason and Police are stopping cars and people walking around. If we do not have a good reason we face a fine of £60.00. Reasons are, to visit a Supermarket once per week or a Chemist. To go for a walk, but near our home, we cannot drive to take a walk and we must keep social distancing. Anything else we are not allowed to do. I think if the Police were doing the same thing in Fethiye they would have to employ hundreds more Policemen to stop every car, scooter, motor bike and pedestrian. I watched in amazement at a film for FRT TV where the lady working for the Station went into a Bakery and stood next to the Baker with a microphone and interviewed him. No social distancing no masks. Then she turned to his wife got right up close and interviewed her. This is total madness. Then there was film of a road accident when a motorcyclist was killed. The police and public all standing around so close to each other, again no social distancing and no masks or glove worn by the Police.. I also saw a video of a TV. Presenter talking to a large family group, all standing on the beach at Karagozler. No one over there seems to be taking this virus seriously and lots of people are in denial."
"I have seen that FJ, and all I can see, it is not that busy with people walking but yes a lot of cars, don't forget the banks are open and they are all close to each other. They always use the parking spaces in the town. I assure you Paspatur is totally dead, so is the umbrella street and the fish market. It is dead!Ask you friend why she did not stay at home and I do guess she is as curious as many of the others.I live in Kayaköy and people are at home, we are all staying home. And as I said I was in town twice in the past two weeks and I was alone in Migros, all alone! Then I was on the fish market to get some fresh veggies and fruit also there I was the only one. Only the shop owners were there. The I picked up a chicken dürüm for lunch outside Paspatur and that takeaway shop was the only one open, selling from the window and no seating space. That is also reality. Some want to show the bad some want to show the good. Nobody is now allowed to enter or exit Mugla province without permission anymore. You can debate if that came too late because in fact many from the cities did already come down to their summerhouses on the coast and brought the virus with them. Plus there was also a movie on FB about all cars coming down from Seydikemer being checked. Yes there are naive people and some people walk around with the looks of a real hero and a bottle of cologne in their hand but generally people stay at home. It is like want you want others to see and you you don't want other see. I live here, people are scared for the virus and people are also scared there will be no season. Honestly that is also the situation here.Edited: 4:30 am, April 01, 2020 "
"My friend was in Fethiye go to the Bank and was shocked at the amount of cars and people around Fethiye which is why she started to film. However, there is no restriction on anyone driving around in town. Police are not stopping cars, like they are in the U.K. Even with this killer vira, cars are still packing Fethiye.A business I know in Fethiye that sell clothing and have an online shop, where in Kaya at the Ghost Village, yesterday taking pictures of their models wearing the clothing they have for sale. That was really surprising that they would travel there to take photographs in these desperate times. This would never be allowed in the U.K. As they could be carrying the virus from one town to a village.Turkey will realise too late that they are being very slow to take action.Edited: 5:05 am, April 01, 2020 "
"I agree that that is really stupid, these are the people who think they are the exception. But stupid as anywhere else, I did see the pictures of the full beaches in the Netherlands and the UK only just a few days ago. I do agree that every government should put their foor down, you won't go anywhere in these days with our European arrogance and civil disobedience. We have to stand together so the time we quarantine ourselves will be so much shorter. That is really a shame."
"I think before you make statements like 'no one over there seems to be taking this seriously' you should check your facts, here are some images of Bodrum, for example.bodrummuhabiri.com/bos-sokaklar-havadan-goru…And as I said before, Turgutreis has been close to empty on the few occasions I've ventured in to town.As VR said, as with every where there are idiots who believe it doesn't apply to them and it would seem from what you say that many of them have gathered in Fethiye, but please do not throw around statements like that."
"Sue, please do not throw around assumptions. I was speaking about Fethiye when I said over there, as my post was about over there in Fethiye.I know nothing of your area, why should I? This is not the Bodrum or Turgutreis Forum. However, I am a bit baffled that in the whole of Turkey only the over 65’s are being locked in and not allowed to go out, which is why in my further post I said that Turkey were slow to take action. We over in the U.K. are all to stay in but for one trip to the supermarket or chemist each week and one walk per day and no going on unecessary trips our we can face a fine of £60.00Edited: 12:57 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"Actually FJ these are the facts about the lockdown in the UK:""The public have been ordered to “stay indoors” and to only leave the house for one of these four reasons:- Shopping for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Shopping trips should be as infrequent as possible- One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk, or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with- Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can continue to take their children to school- Travelling to and from work, but only where work absolutely cannot be done from homeThe government has announced strict social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people.""Shopping trips are to be ""as infrequent as possible"" - that is not the same as once a week."
"Given the absence of certain essential products, I am force to go shopping every other day in a bid to hunt these items down. If I was forced to go only once a week, there would be issues. Luckily there is no such regulation.Anyway, this thread has gone so massively off topic."
"Attagul, there is no one in the U.K that does no know that. It is explained to us every day. Especially here in Scotland, where we get our rules from the Scottish Government and it is advising us to shop once per week..Our rules are very strict. I am glad to say,. However, I did not want to bore Sue going through everything we have been told. I think she will already get the picture.Asif, We can shop once per week, we have everything in our Shops here in our part of Scotland the only thing missing is hand sanitised. However, the supermarkets have it available to use went we arrive.Topic may have gone off a bit, but, as we cannot get to Turkey we are keeping the forums alive.Edited: 2:26 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"Perhaps the situation is not clear for those living abroad, and what one little movie on FB does. All those people in the movie had something to do possibly and perhaps they were all filming how disobedient others are.Nevertheless all governments take steps according on hoe this develops. the first case here was on March 9, 5 weeks before that already in the UK. But we are living the same rules. Only go out if needed for necessary shopping and so. The total lockdown are for 65+ only and it means for them to totally not leave the house, not at all they must stay inside! There are special numbers for them to help out for bank work or shopping. Also expats (that relates to the topic) can make use of this help.The country is vast, with lots of remote places, the major focus seems on the big cities that are hit most.Edited: 2:45 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"O yes, forgot to mention that those who arrived from abroad (when that was still possible) had to self quarantine for 2 weeks and they were checked upon on a daily basis."
Let’s just pull together whether you’re Turkish or English. We all love Turkey; that’s why we’re on this forum. Let’s look forward to the time when this is all over and we can visit again.
"Hi Onyer, is it still the case?"
"There is no rule in force here in Scotland stating that we are only allowed out once a week to shop for necessities, however, we are being asked to avoid going out unless absolutely necessary & to make as little trip to shops as is possible, which most people I know are abiding by. We consider ourselves extremely lucky where we live - we have no real need to go out at all due to the local village businesses up and down Deeside providing free deliveries of all food essentials and medical needs on a regular basis. They’ve been a god send ......I just hope we all keep supporting them after this is all over because we owe them!https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/"
"Hi Ven R Yes they have now extended the travel ban for a further 15 days from today. It is now stricter and includes travel between Provences by car, rail, sea or air unless you are delivering goods or government business ie you can’t travel from Istanbul to Muğla Also there is a curfew during the weekends now"
"Travel ban between provinces was a bit late as so many people from places like Istanbul and Ankara rushed to places like Boddam and Fethiye, to get away from the virus and now they are stuck in these places and could have brought the virus with them."
I too would like to know this. Is the foreign entry ban still in force until 30th April?
Hi As it stands with the latest restrictions on the 19th the ban is now at least until 4th of May but much more likely to be longer EasyJet cancelled out flight on the 6th of May today
"Thanks for the update Onyer,My flight is on the 25th May, I am just waiting for Easyjet to cancel it officially so we can rebook/refund.Keep us posted."
"HiWe had flights also in April So far it looks like they are cancelling 11 to 14 days before the flight, also they did it per flight rather than the whole booking.They now have 2021 flights upto April 18th to Dalaman available to bookIf you want a refund rather than the voucher or flight change, I’ve put up a link on here In another post"
