Who ever heard about this site . I believe what they wrote on that site as much i believe about the tooth fairy .
"if thy do, china gets it first, china has big investments in Cuba in biotech companies they set them all up."
"The drug (Interferon alfa-2b) has apparently been approved around the world for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, chronic hepatitis B, and a variety of cancers.I read that there can be some side effects that have limited its approval in USA for anything but the ones mentioned above.I also read that in some countries (including Cuba) it has been used for treatment of shingles.Cuba did not invent this drug. But apparently, they seem to be manufacturing it in Cuba and plan to use it.…granma.cu/cuba/2020-03-17/biocubafarma-guar…radiorebelde.cu/english/…"
A friend in Cuba right now called to ask me to check his flight home tomorrow. At this time he said there is much talk within Cuba about this cure. That is why I researched it and found this site.He gathered this information on a local level. He is not in a resort.
"@6 this is all propaganda, even if its true china gets it first they can mass produce it for there citizen they built 2 hospitals in 1 week on site."
"interferon Alfa 2 B has not been developed in Cuba: it was at the University of Zurich and the licence belongs to Europe Medicines Agency. Ot is true however that Cuba produces it medication but they are not the only ones...Edited: 12:15 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Classic propaganda.
It is regular joe blow Cubans on the street talking about this. How does it make it propaganda. I am not saying it is true but it has come from people in the streets who have been speaking to other people that are more informed than any official source.
"joe blow Cuban on the street only knows if there beer shortages in Cuba in advance.^^^^Edited: 12:26 pm, March 17, 2020 "
The article states that Cuba has come up with a cure. It is all lies. They had nothing to do with the development of interferons and are claiming That they somehow have some sort of proof that certain type of interferons will cure covid 19. I don’t know the source of this article but it’s not a medical journal or anything like that.
"Cuba has been making and using interferon for quite awhile now.., and I read weeks ago that the Chinese had been using it to help with the virus."
Give your head a shake rat. Gossip on the street in Cuba is less reliable than the information offered on here as fact.
"Hardly propaganda. Alpha interferons are produced by vertebrate immune systems as a response to viral infections. The drug in question is actually called recombinant interferon alpha 2B (a ""synthetic"" version). I expect the use of it for covid-19 may be experimental, but there had been some promising results when it was tested on the SARS virus in 2003 or 2004.But then some of us like to believe that any information coming out of Cuba is merely propaganda. I do agree that gossip is something we should all be careful about believing.Edited: 12:37 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Well it is propaganda when they falsely take credit and invent a story about developing Interferon alfa-2b. They only manufacture it and they are not alone.Edited: 12:41 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Okay I give up you are all right I am wrong. I never said it was true I said they may have a cure. The fact is if you want the facts rather than gossip. They do have medicine they are using in Cuba it is in a testing phase. Other countries have also inquired about this medicine. It is there and is being used. For me I would think the info provided by relatives in the health care system in Cuba whether called gossip or not has somewhat valid. For this reason I will not be giving my head a shake anytime soon.
The particular article that the OP has posted States that Cuba has developed interferons when that is not the case. There’s a number of lies in that article. If you’re telling Cubans that they’re the ones that discovered this when that is definitely not the case then I would say that’s mass lying. Maybe interferons might be able to help with Covid 19 but to say that Cuba is responsible for the development of them is wrong. Also leading people to believe that there might potential he be a cure when very little testing has been completed is not good. Hoping for the best.
Jack there are also those that will believe everything that comes out Cuba .Seriously we all know that link from from the OP is a total joke but i guess some will continue to believe anything that they will find on the internet and take it for granted .
Interferon alpha 2B has been manufactured and used in the US and other countries for a long time. I don't know if it is still manufactured in the US or not. It now sees very little use because there are newer more effective drugs without the toxic side effects of Interferon alpha 2B. I was at a social gathering last Saturday where just about every attendee was either a physician or a senior hospital administrative person. I specifically asked about Interferon alpha 2B. No one assigned any value to it for COVID-19.
Ratwalto. Definitely don’t think it’s a situation where you’re right or wrong but A matter of not spreading fake news. You would think you could post an article just for discussion but there are too many people out there that believe everything they read.
"The original article is not a Cuban based website (in fact, it appears to be based in Hawaii), and when they imply that the drug was developed in Cuba, they are probably misinterpreting the actual information. I have not seen any of the official news out of Cuba that claims that the drug was developed in Cuba.It appears they are hoping that it works. But I have some doubts about it too."
The key word in my original post was may. Cuba may have a cure. I did not say I believe everything I read or hear is true. Far from it. I did not say the article was true. I did not say what my friend heard in Cuba was true.
"Rat, I never opened your link. I assumed it was to do with Interferon A 2b. I was referring to the arm chair quarterbacks and others on TA citing opinion as fact. Agreed, consider the source. Do ask yourself thou, Have you ever met a Cuban who admitted they were wrong? Gossip is a national sport."
