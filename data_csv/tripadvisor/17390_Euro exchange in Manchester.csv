"HiI am on a buget travel to athens, santorini, kos from 20/9 till 26/9, wanna know is it always better to exchange my GBP into EURO before flight?? or better to just use my HSBC debit card while traveling?If exchange for EURO, where does it usually offer BETTER rate? Would it be bank/ private agent/ ..etc? Does the rate stay the same for one particular day or maybe better rate near the end of the day?I am in Manchester UK area, any help appreciated as this is my first time Euro travel.Cheers all"
"It is usually better to take a small amount of Euros with you to see you through the first day while you get organised and then use your debit card to get cash from ATMs wherever you travel.Make sure you tell your bank before you travel, otherwise you may find your card blocked for 'unusual activity'.If you have a credit card, you can use that for payment overeas too, but again you must tell the card company before you travel.Don't feel tempted to carry large amounts of cash around in British Pounds or Euros... it is too risky."
"but if I use the ATM when i arrive, is there still transaction fee applied? and does it hand me Euro straight from ATM?Do you mean the euro ATM rate is better or same comparing with the exchange rate in uk?"
"You will get Euros from the ATM at your destination. Fees will be applied by your bank and an exchange rate to convert it into pounds.This still works out better than carrying lots of cash with you. Find out from your bank what its charges are for using the card to draw cash abroad. The exchange rate will be that on the day of the withdrawal.An alternative you could consider is a preloaded card, such as the Caxton Euro Traveller card which you can use without charge to make payments or draw cash from ATMs in Euros. You link that to your bank account and upload an amount of money onto to it, which is when Caxton applies its conversion rate, but your bank charges you nothing. You can top up the balance on the preloaded card via their website or by text if you need to.There may be little difference overall in the costs of currency conversion between those two, but both are better than changing a large amount of money before you travel."
"Unless you have one of the very rare debit cards which does not charge, you will be subject to 2 fees when you withdraw money in Greece - a flat rate fee, and a conversion fee. Since the flat rate fee is the same if you withdraw €20 or €300, then it makes sense to always withdraw as much as possible when using the ATM - €300 is within the limits of most cards, being a bit less than €300.The final rate after charges will be within a cent of what you can get here, as the exchange rate used at the ATM is the interbank rate, which is better than the standard tourist rate.I strongly advise you to get some € before you go, so you don't have to worry about getting money in the first couple of days. The best exchange rates at home these days seem to be at the new generation of ""money places"" - cash generator, money shop etc. Travel agents will often be a bit worse but may match a better rate, and in my experience post offices and banks are a bit behind.M&S and Tesco also do exchange at reasonable rates in some of their stores.Enjoy your holiday!

"Thanks a lot Steve and others.I am thinking the same too! i will go to athens, santorini, kos, and last pisa italy, how much would you recommend to have it for two people for 8 days?"
"Do you have all your accommodation and travel already booked and paid for?If so, in Greece the ballpark figure for a couple is about €100 per day per couple. You can live pretty well for that, unless you eat in upmarket places and drink cocktails till 3 am in nightclubs!! I imagine Italy will be a bit more expensive but not much."
If you do want to exchange in the airport. Book in advance as you get a dramatically better rate and just pick up on the day...…moneysavingexpert.com/holiday-money/
