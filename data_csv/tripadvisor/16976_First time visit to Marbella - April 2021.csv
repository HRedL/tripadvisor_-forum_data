"Hi everyone,Iâ€™m organising a trip to Marbella mid-April next year - first time, very excited! I know the season normally begins from end of April, but do you know if bars/restaurants will be open from mid-April? We travel on 15th for three nights.Just want to see if restaurants/bars will be open. Thank you in advance :)"
Marbella isa city of over a hundred and forty thousand people so apart from the places aimed a tourists there are plenty of all year places for the locals.Have you booked your accomodation yet. If so where is it
Thanks for coming back to me :)We are staying near PB. We ideally would like some nightlife so do you think bars/clubs will be open?Thanks!Nicolle
The bars and clubs in PB are generally pretty expensive.
