"Not too much has changed, but there have been some developments. - There are now 8 active cases of COVID-19 in Nepal, with one locally transmitted case. For those up on their Nepali geography, cases are in/near Baglung, Nepalgunj, and the Far West near Surkhet. Baglung and Butwal are the closest to Pokhara. (If there are really 8, I suspect there are 80, if not 800 unconfirmed cases).- The government has now dispatched testing equipment to all 7 provinces, although it's highly unlikely it will be properly used in some areas. Karnali province doesn't have two rupees to rub together, so I wouldn't expect much in the West. They're still gathering in large crowds for select festivals and sporting events. - The government has now taken to infighting and political dickering over the situation, which is tragic, but right on time. Idiots.- The lockdown has been extended nationwide until April 15. International flights are prohibited until late April. We suspect there will be no flights until early May.- There are still thousands of people crossing, and attempting to cross the southern border into Nepal. The military is monitoring the border. More than 8,000 people are ""in quarantine"" but that seems unlikely from our reports. There are rampant reports of COVID in the border states of India, and those people will get through to Nepal. - The newspapers continue to report of thousands of people ""getting tested"" but there are never published results. Per usual, national reporting sucks. In some part because local and provincial authorities are blocking journalists from getting on site.- There are very few evacuation flights being planned. The remaining foreigners, like me, have had to report our whereabouts to the Tourist Police and outline our plans, as well as list our resources to be able to stay put safely. - In less great news, there have been increased threats against foreigners. Locals are fearful foreigners have the virus, which is daft. Anyone here now, has been here for weeks. Even the national press is complicit in fanning the flames against tourists.My personal outlook - Despite the capacity to test 1,000 people a day, the influx of people coming in from India is the real problem. A lack of quarantine is an issue. The quarantine facilities in place now are a perfect place to breed more infections. There is a pending zombie apocolypse of potentially infected people on the border ready to invade Nepal and spread the disease to the farthest, most remote corners of the country. And the government is ill prepared to stop it.There is a slim chance those of us here now will be able to leave May 1. I suspect the viral cases will balloon before then, likely closing off Nepal for the entire monsoon season. It's about to get ugly.Edited: 1:47 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"Hi QuitouAs always thanks for the update. Really appreciate getting some news from the front line as it were. I suspect that even if air travel to Nepal becomes possible again in May there will be few takers as every point the plane touches down you will have to go for a fortnight in isolation. I would also, unfortunately, pick May for the crescendo of the pandemic in South Asia.EricMy Nepal Pages https://wanderingeric.org/category/nepal/Edited: 4:03 pm, April 08, 2020 "
Thanks too Quitou. A stark and depressing picture. I hope Nepal has a miraculous escape from the worst case scenario.scoodly
that doesn't look like an update - more like negative speculation from a bored tourist who should have left long ago
"@gymbell, Speculation? A little bit, but I doubt I'm wrong. Bored? Absolutely. I'm also not inclined one bit to leave. We're not tourists and have an objective. My organization has more than 200 portable chlorine makers here that we use to purify water on a community scale for more than 20,000 people. We are currently deploying those devices to produce high volumes of disinfectant solution to help communities prepare to defend against the creep of COVID. It's the same tool used to quell ebola in Africa. So, there is a reason why we stayed behind. I'm also a journalist with a team in the country providing information to various outlets.  As for negative, yes. The positives here include a long list of things related to the lockdown, which has been well executed, for the most part, in the metropolitan areas. That said, in typical Nepali fashion, for every three things the government does to put things on the right footing, they do one thing to unravel all of those efforts.It may sound negative. To me it's just heartbreaking reality.Edited: 10:51 pm, April 08, 2020 "
Thank you - I appreciate the first hand update. As someone who would have returned in November for my 20th trip I have many fond memories and like many pray and hope Nepal can dodge the worst while fearing it can't.

"Unfortunately we see a rise of nationalist and xenophobic politics all around the world. It is a very bad omen for the future of travel, or even for the future of the world."
"@gymbellYour post served as a good reminder to me --For the last 20 days, and for the next 30, we are staying with our friends at their hotel in Pokhara. We're the only guests in their 36 room hotel. They have provided us with a cook, two great meals a day, and today they went so far as to swap out the rugs and furniture in our room, just to give us a change.They are pulling out all the stops to make us comfortable and safe. That's the Nepal I know and love. A couple of weeks ago I helped produce a few local news pieces about Dorje Lama, a local restaurant owner who provided more than 400 free meals to travelers stuck in Pokhara. Such stories abound. These are dark times, made darker by a crappy government, but the people at large are doing their best. That's why I chose to live here."
why not report the positive stories on here if there are so manyreport some travel information like clear view of a pointy mountain or if the Gentians are flowering yetthe Nepal government doesn't know what they are doing any more than any other governmentit is no good being wise in hindsight as anyone can see what went wrong after it has happenedis the Prime Minister of Nepal in intensive care?are the streets of Kathmandu lined with refrigerated trucks full of bodies?perhaps Nepal is doing better than other places even if there is more that could be doneplenty of spoilt rich 20ish brats here complaining they are entitled to go to their beach houses to party with their friendsthankfully a large party of wedding guests all got fined today for breaking the rulesI can easily isolate in a big house on a big property and you can isolate in big rooms of a tourist hotel but it must be very difficult for the typical Nepal family and village to isolate when they live so closelythe homeless people here are being put in the unused hotels and the government is throwing money around to everyone (except me) but I doubt Nepal can do thatit was foreigners who caused all the infections here or people being in contact with them so being wary of foreigners is understandable though of course it is the travel or moving around that has caused the spreadI feel more sorry for the unfortunate people stranded with nothing on the India/Nepal border than for all the Australians stranded around the world with all their comforts and resources

"Kathmandu is also considered by a number of its own, to be one of the holiest places on earth. But this perception is devoid of regular samsaric conceptions, so I guess I will leave that one there. After the trauma of the earthquake, being labeled a ticking bomb is a lot of salt!"
"Hi Quitou, I just wanted to thank you for your in-depth analysis of the situation in Nepal. For those of us planning a trip in the not-too-distant-future (whenever that is!) it is invaluable to get such an unvarnished insight and enables realistic planning. As a fellow ex-journalist, I am all too familiar with many people's desire to hear good news, especially in times when they urgently need something to look forward to. However, I believe that it is ultimately always better to have a grasp on whatever is really happening to be able to make realistic plans. On a more general point, it sounds like Nepal is pretty much like most other places on earth - lovely, decent people led by inept politicians...!"
"@ gymbe1l ...again.Positive updates are diminishing, but an optimistic outlook quickly notes that there are only 8 active cases. The other strong positive is that the population at large, for the most part, is terrified and adhering to a very strict lockdown. Of course, there are exceptions. Most of the people on this forum stay within tourist zones, and probably don't know about the millions of Nepali in the remote areas for which science and medicine hold little weight. Getting that demographic to abide by lockdown rules is virtually impossible. These are people for whom black magic cures all.The good news as of late:- The international flight ban has been extended to April 30, and may push beyond.- The current lockdown will invariably extend to April 30. Internal communications leaked yesterday point that direction.- Domestic flights are slated to be open April 15, but the AOAN just announced salary cuts for pilots and workers, so, planes will likely be grounded all month.In other words, strong measures are in place to keep people locked in place. Movements are minimal.The concerning developments include:- Testing in Baglung looks to be a mess. Aside from the mob of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder in Nepali fashion, the test accuracy is under strong doubt. If not in the test itself, but the test application. Until more symptoms become obvious, it's hard to rely on test info.- Our sources in Banke observed a pending disaster in the quarantine camps. There are an estimated 10,000 people in those camps, in close quarters, with minimal safeguards in place to ensure those who leave, are negative. It's turned into a place where SUSPECTED people are clumped together, where the virus could spread, before those people are then dispatched to rural areas all over the west. It's a worst-case scenario in terms of planning and execution.- The hospitals in Nepalgunj, Surket, Chitwan, and elsewhere in the Terai are also turning away people with symptoms, nor are those people being traced. There are other problems developing between private and gov hospitals, but that's more about politics and corruption than anything.- The most pressing issue nationwide has to do with the implications of another week+ of lockdown. People are running out of food and fuel. The police are starting to lose control of the masses. In many areas the lockdown is showing weakness. There are now concerns about salaries for police. That could be a huge issue in the next two weeks.- From a general standpoint, the measures put in place are only moderately well executed, when they need to be flawless, like the testing program. The other measures, like the mass quarantine camps, are just a horrible idea, and terribly executed.All of this matters as it sets the stage for what is to come in the next 30-45 days. If the government can't stop their infighting, they will lose control of the border areas. The real x-factor here has less to do with Nepal, but what happens in Utter Pradesh, India. That will determine what happens between today and the end of monsooons."
"The magic is not always black....although there is some irony between animal sacrifice and healing.Hard for those of the Christian west to offer that irony to Hindus on Good Friday, as that story is basically a blood sacrifice as well to those not of that tradition.Can the scientists and the mystical lightly hold hands? As you suggest Q, millions of Nepalese just do not run on the tourists thought systems. Those that do, probably easily slip out of their thinly veiled modern persona, and back into the deeper unconscious of their traditions and DNA.The evidence of this is found as much in the valley as in the more far flung areas."
Nepal extends COVID-19 testing but no new cases @ https:/…
"@15 All of the foreign epidemiologists agree, something is not right with the testing. For 9 positive cases to have such close contact with dozens of people, yet only result in one transmission, is unlikely as it has no similar example anywhere in the world."
"what percentage of average Nepalis have TB and malaria treatments?leading research here is based on those 2 drugsmaybe not a cure all but if it holds Covid off in Nepal for some time then it may be a blessingalso how many are drinking immune boosting rose tea rather than wine, using immune boosting tumeric in meals rather than Mcfat from take aways etc"
"@gymbe1lOf the 30 million people here, only a tiny fraction have access to any medication at all, certainly not many with access to those types of meds. With regard to immune systems, some I'm sure are quite robust, but also consider that 50% of all kids here qualify as malnourished and/or under developed. Typically when typhoid, cholera, or even bouts of flu take hold here, it's pretty severe."
"Be aware that the local population is very young. Medium age is in the low 20ies. Only 15% is older than 50 years old.For people less than 50 years old, Covid-19 letality is less than 0.01% (with no real treatment).As around the world, the real sanitory challenge is presently for the elders. The youngers will heavily suffer later from the economic crisis.If coming back to Nepal, the risk for an old western visitor will be to meet an asymptomatic young nepali. Small probability if you are trekking out of the beaten track.Fabrice"

"Unprepared as lack of political will has come to the fore in positives and negatives due to this. By a positive, I mean the mechanics of Neo Liberalism are likely to be or have been, unscrewed to ward of an economic and social disaster. Australia is a case in point. A government that is basically the grand child of Margret Thatcher is recognising society exists! Where the funds are coming from to support society suggests governments have a bit more than they let on and people have suffered needlessly for years! It will be hard to put the ‘genie back in the lamp!’Do the powers that be have the same chest of support in Nepal? Most probably. More without the corruption of course. If anyone would like to help the people of Nepal, Rangjung Yeshe Shenpen works directly with people. At the moment they are supporting daily pay workers, As in India, these people are hit the hardest in the lockdown. To be sure, Shenpen is a branch of the KaNying Monastery, but the works are in the secular community by secular people.Edited: 6:57 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"There have been important updates as of today, not that page two of this thread wasn't...well....anyway.As of today, there are 13 active cases and many see this as the start of what most of us feared. The quarantine measures and lack of control at the border, have already created a problem the size of which, will not be known for a few weeks.The last four people to test positive came from the border area of Birgunj. Three Indian nationals tested positive yesterday. The real bad news is that they had been in Birgunj for two weeks. Which means they either imported the virus, or got it in the tightly packed quarantines and living areas in the area.Today's confirmed case is that of a tea shop owner in Birgunj. It would be inconceivable to think more transimissions have not been made.The lockdown has the aim to distance individuals and put a stop to large gatherings. Unfortunately, Nepal being Nepal, the quarantine centers have become the opposite of social distancing measures. They have in fact, served to corral people, healthy and sick, to then infect each other. Then, for reasons unknown or uneducated, people not showing symptoms are let to leave, dispatching the virus to te four corners of Nepal.While 99% of the country is on lockdown, the government created a place whereby 1%, near the danger zones, are placed in camps almost engineered to spread the virus. So, here we go. We assume the lockdown will hold until April 30 and beyond. Other measures will have to be addressed. Millions of people are running out of food and supplies.And of course, political infighting and corruption continues."
You have to think that herd immunity in all its sadness in getting there will be the end point....unless the Nepalese having a particular DNA
@16 You are right. All of the foreign epidemiologists agree something is not right with the testing. Another coronavirus positive case in Nepal; tally reaches 14. https://english.onlinekhabar.com/another-cor…
"I really want to know what time and when we can go to visit Nepal again ??? May be, long time this will be not possible ?"
"@Toni S, Believe me when I say, I need to start getting clients to Nepal as soon as possible. That prospect is looking grim for the fall. This could have been the government's time to shine, not that they have before, and while some positive steps have been made, they have constructed a scenario for the virus to flood the country. The answer to your question depends on two things: 1) How lucky Nepal gets with a low case count at the border. 2) How quickly the government addresses their missteps to create densely packed quarantine camps where the virus is most likely to enter the country.For now, there is no way to know where this is headed. The testing is ramping up, but the skill level of the people in place to facilitate those tests is uncertain. The test themselves could be the problem.Just basing my best guess on what the experts and trends say, if there is an explosion of positive results here along the border, it's easy to see how the virus could decimate every corner of the country, particularly in places like Kathmandu, Butwal, Nepalgunj, and even the most rural villages. If that happens, there is absolutely nothing to stop it. There are enough hospital beds to serve less than 100 people in a country with 30 million. The world would get it's first example of what an unchecked Covid outbreak looks like. So, too soon to tell. The next 30 days will provide the information you seek. If the outbreak balloons into the thousands, I would not see traveling here until well after the new year, maybe not until fall 2021. But who knows. Maybe the lockdown will do it's work and keep the virus in check. That seems like a long shot."
"It does not depend only on what happens in Nepal. It also depends on our home countries. Like right now it is forbidden for Europeans to travel outside of Europa, and it may well remain so till 2021. It also depends on airlines, prices may well explode especially if they must leave a third or half the seats only. There is also the huge concern of insurance, insurance companies will not cover the virus ...So I'm not optimistic. I don't see tourists in Nepal before mid 2021 at the earliest."
"Re:#26####if there is an explosion of positive results here along the border, it's easy to see how the virus could decimate every corner of the country####Don't be misled by the Western situation where elders and oversized people make a big part of the population. These people are really at risk, but there are not that many in Nepal. Look at the nepali population by age classes.For the rest of the population, the huge majority, the challenge will be to address the consequences of economic crisis. Not directly Covid-19.FabriceP.S.: medium age of the population is 23.6 years old vs in the 40s for most of western countries.Edited: 2:26 am, April 14, 2020 "
"For western travel companies, the difficulty will derive from coronavirus circulation in Nepal. This coronavirus circulation will not cause lot of deaths of nepali people.But without a vaccine, it will be a risk for western people travelling in Nepal if they are old or with a comorbidity (especially if oversized). With coronavirus circulation, they can have a contact with a covid-19 infected nepali, possibly asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic.Risk far lower for young people in good shape. These people should be the focus of marketing push of travelling companies.Fabrice"
"In the 1970s and 1980s we travelled without any insurance. But those days, even young people will not travel abroad without insurance."
"You would have to imagine that unless it is proven that immunity occurs after an initial illness, and certification in your passport, two weeks to every trip for quarantine will need to be added...or four, if the demand is the same from the country visited.In which case, to travel, do you go and get the virus and then the certificate, if applicable.....is it worth the risk given it is hard to predict ones bodily response. They will not be relaxing restrictions in Ozz ant time soon to social gatherings soooo....."
