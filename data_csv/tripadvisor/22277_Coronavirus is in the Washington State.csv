"Already one woman died. Others are infected. Since it is spreading like flu, I am not sure what kind of outcome we will see in the upcoming months. I booked airline tickets already, paid for the car rental, and paid for a two night stay. I guess now I will only be booking nights that you can get a full refund. I am not sure if other reservations I made, would be refunded. I used some miles as well for the booking."
"One person has claimed the victim was a woman. Everyone else says the patient was a man. It is a sad day. ""The patient was a man in his 50s who had underlying health conditions, according to Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington state. President Donald Trump and US officials previously said in a press briefing that the patient was a woman."" https:/…"
"The fatality was in Kirkland, not in Seattle, and the person who died had pulmonary problems before he went to the hospital. Hardly a reason to change your plans."
At the risk of fear mongering I think it's safe to assume that Covid-19 is everywhere. We're not scanning for people with fevers or otherwise at national or international US airports. I would assume that eventually you will come into contact and should take all necessary precautions.
"I am sorry that you are feeling anxious about your trip. You should do whatever action makes you feel the most comfortable. You didn't mention when you plan to travel. I will say, that I do believe it is true that the virus has probably made it quite a few places already. The fact that the majority of people with the disease have mild symptoms means that those cases go under the public heath radar. It is, sadly, those with additional risk factors that seem to have the higher rate of severe illness."
"I am not cancelling plans at the moment. I will just book lodging that can be refunded from now on. If the virus is going to go up in numbers to cause a safety issue, then we won’t travel to Washington but go elsewhere or stay home. Change of our travel plans in the past made me angry and sad. But I learned to not to be greedy with seeing beautiful sites and trust what’s meant to come. And count blessings everyday."
"If you think another place or your home place is safer, you are wrong. This is a virus that spreads everywhere it's just a question of when.Edited: 1:33 am, March 01, 2020 "
You might be right. We are not far from O’Hare Airport.
"Corona virus causes the common cold. You have caught and recovered from more corona virus infections than you can count. Covid-19 is clearly more dangerous, but so are cars, guns, and fatty foods.Meanwhile, 16,000 people have died of influenza so far this 'flu season in the US alone.....Edited: 11:09 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Not a good comparison. The regular flu has been around for a long time, it has a vaccine and a lot lower death rate. Corona virus has been around for 2 months, health officials still don't completely understand it, it is a lot more contagious and has a lot higher death rate."
"Coronavirus does NOT cause the “common cold.” It is similar to, but not the same pathogen as, influenza. SARS and MERS are caused by corona viruses (different ones). This one is new and different one; apparently not as deadly as those two but it appears to be highly contagious."
"So ... ensuring that advance travel purchases are refundable is a particularly good/great idea this year. Good call, Anna.Edited: 1:31 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"This isn't the place to discuss medical specifics (or lack thereof). Exposure to viruses exists everywhere, any time. Particularly given the fact that you had to sideline your previous trip, Anna, it seems you'd make refundable reservations regardless of the current situation.~ Colleen"
"I agree this is not the place for medical advice; I just wanted to dispel the notion that this coronavirus causes the common cold.For others making their travel plans for the next few months, I will point out that Alaska Airlines is offering a waiver for tickets purchased now through March 12, for travel up until June 1. Such tickets come with a one-time opportunity to change or cancel with no penalty.https://www.alaskaair.com/"
"There is no basis for ""clicking out"" my comment. To repeat: this isn't the venue to discuss medical specifics or lack thereof. (Not directing that at you, Enzian; I know you were simply responding to a misconception.) Anna, you experienced the realities of having to cancel a previous trip and if I were you, I'd make refundable travel purchases, too. I agree that this situation is concerning. We have a trip to New Orleans planned next month (flying Alaska), but have no plans to postpone. Viruses are present everywhere, any time. ~ Colleen"
"You are right, Colleen; there was nothing objectionable about you post. I read it as a reminder to stay on topic and avoid misinformation. Isn’t there a procedure for appealing the removal of a post? Or is that only for appeal of a closed topic. ( I guess as a DE I should know the answer, but I do not).The ease with which persons other than the Mods can force the removal of a post is an annoying feature of this forum. I am a firm believer in free speech and open discourse, and the only time I have “zapped” a post was in the case of profanity in “my” forum (Grand Canyon) that I felt was hurtful to the whole TA community."

"I see it has been reinstated, so that is good."
"Coleen,I didn’t make refundable reservations. I was going to add that on when booking airline tickets but was told that that insurance doesn’t really refund, and they usually find something not to pay. I should have looked elsewhere to buy insurance to cover trips for cancellations for ANY reason. But I didn’t. It would be a curse if something would come up again like last year when my husband dislocated his ankle and sustained fractures. He couldn’t walk for months. If we loose money again, then I will not make that mistake again. Hopefully, not. When booking our lodging now, I will only book where you can be refunded.The car rental and airline tickets won’t be refunded. I used miles for a two night stay. It said they give refunds with cancellation. But I used miles, so not sure how that would work.Edited: 1:31 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"""I will only book where you can be refunded.""You can make reservations with 24 hr cancellation often seen when you book direct with the hotels. You do not need to put any money down when making reservations onlyIf you cancel with less then 24 hrs you only lose that one night. the difference between Pay now to get a discount and just reserve with not money is what I call my insurance cost. It works even when using AAA/AARP discountsEdited: 2:26 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"If the region was actually talking about a quarantine, I’d understand, Anna, but it’s a single health care facility and the people who’ve died had underlying health issues. Meaning they were already sick. Meaning pretty much any virus or infection would’ve been bad news for them. I’m guessing you have no plans to visit any hospital, let alone that facility, so I’m not sure why you’d cancel at this point.You must be less indecisive than I am. I understand the nonrefundable plane reservations but there’s no good reason to book nonrefundable hotel or car rentals. Plans change, one might find a better deal elsewhere."
"Right now my sister and myself have a trip planned from May 27-June 2 which includes a afternoon visit to Seattle. We are flying into Portland and the trip is to see Mt. Rainier then go up to Seattle for the rest of the day before heading to the coast. Right now those plans are still in place, depending on what occurs between now and then will determine if we alter our plans. We could just skip the Seattle part and head for the coast where we will have far less large group contact with people. Both myself and my sister are in the ""higher"" risk category as seniors with some health issues."
"Marie--I don't think ""underlying health issues"" means they were already sick. My husbands coworker who is still in the hospital, technically has anunderlying health issue (born with it) but was not sick before this. It can mean a suppressed immune system, etc but that is different than already being sick."
"Getting refunds if cancelling your trip: Like cbaarch's advice (post #21). That said, we went the pre-paid route to get what we felt was a good rate several months ago. The hotel waived their normal policy and we have received a full refund (we were scheduled to arrive Saturday). I would guess other hotels may be following a similar practice given the current situation in Seattle. So if others are in a similar situation, see if they are open to waiving the policy."
"As of today, 3/4/2020, there are 10 dead of the Coronavirus in Washington State. Prayer would be appropriate."
"I don’t want to panic. What we can’t run from are the seats inside the aircraft. Imagine sitting in one for a few hours after someone was carrying the coronavirus. No washing hands will help. Yes, we can all wash hands, but whatever we carry with us also would have to be washed. Our handbags touch other surfaces as well. So even if you wash your hands, I don’t think you will put your handbag in the washing machine. It is almost impossible to keep it safe unless you stay away from crowds. For now, I booked two nights in Seattle. We might change to one. I am not even worried so much about myself but my family and then other people we come in contact with. So, we will still make plans. But I don’t hold so much enthusiasm anymore, because I am trying to accept that we might have to head elsewhere. I will monitor the situation in the upcoming months. Hopefully, it will not come to cancellation or change of plans."
You may want to google about the Sanitizing wipes with min 60% alcohol as that is one recommendation that I have seen when water/soap is not available. We have been using those kind of wipes way before this new virus showed up. One item we wipe is the TV remote in hotels.
"I see your point, but do you also plan to avoid movie theaters, park benches, restaurants? It could literally be anywhere people are. You’re probably statistically more likely to catch it at work, which is what at least one relative is concerned about. (Well, actually, she’s more concerned the school district will shut down and she won’t get paid, which seems unlikely. Who knows, though.)Mtngrl—perhaps “compromised in some way” would be a way to describe it. I agree, it doesn’t literally mean sick. Just vulnerable due to a pre-existing health condition. My point was that if one is healthy to begin with, it most likely isn’t dangerous."
"Marie--I agree, and I figured that is what you meant but wasn't sure:)I also agree that avoiding any place outside of ones home is not realistic. Heck, even stuff that is delivered to our home, someone has already touched. As for only one night in Seattle, do realize that Seattle itself is not the hub of this, it is on the east side in Kirkland and top and down this corridor. cbaarch--If someone is coming here, they need to bring any wipes or sanitizer with them. There are none to be found anywhere around here! Even aloe vera and isopropyl alcohol (to make your own) are gone."
"Even in metro Atlanta the hand sanitizer is hard to find. Fortunately, we already have small travel sizes to bring with us for our trip to Seattle next week."
Seattle will probably be very quiet and businesses may be closed. Many folks have been told to work at home and King County (where Seattle is located) has issued guidelines.https:/…protection.aspx
"Wheatie--I was out with a friend today in our suburb on the east side and it was dead. A few stores closed, but even at the restaurants it was a ghost town. We were both commenting how weird it was compared to normal."
Costco in Issaquah yesterday was packed! You had to line up to get tp or paper towels. It was nuts.
Wow. I was planning to go to a convention at an airport hotel this weekend and now I’m wondering how all of this might impact it.
"Of course it will be impacted, Marie. Our region is in over-the-top ""response"" mode ~ as inefficient& illogical as we know that to be, All of this is misconstrued and poorly handled, we know that. Unfortunately, the media and markets are in their own world.~ Colleen"
"Oh, I know, I’m just surprised the reaction has gone that far, and the convention people haven’t posted anything about it!The only “new” thing I’ve encountered is Starbucks refusing to use reusable containers, which...doesn’t really seem that effective, given that they’re not wiping down stuff or wearing gloves, but I suppose it can’t hurt..."
"On another travel forum I frequent for a foreign country someone has made a starred post which includes links to official governmental information about the coronavirus. TripAdvisor support made the post a sticky note (not sure of technical term).Since information is fluid and Washington state is, this far, on the front lines of both treatment and prevention, I'm wondering if something similar would be useful here. It would take away a lot of the speculation, rumors and misinformation."
"Does anybody know if there is a list or map of where the confirmed infected people were in the past couple of weeks or is it just assumed that there are enough of them that all of Seattle is contaminated at this point? I know with the measles in Chicago they were posting a list so people knew if they were at an increased risk of infection. I'm not too worried about me personally, but I have flown through Seattle a couple of times in the past couple of weeks (with some long layovers) and want to know if I'm at an increased risk of spreading it before I make further travel plans."
I haven’t seen anything that shows where those confirmed had been in the past but this is an interesting site that is updated many times per day.https:/…
I was watching the NBC news last night and it appears that downtown Seattle is nearly a ghost town as many of the top employers are having workers work from home. I was wondering for those living in the area how is it in downtown Seattle according to your local news and such.Right now my sister and myself are schedulled for a visit in late May for a afternoon visit to the Needle and Pike Market. We will decide once we get there based on the info at hand if we will do that or by pass and just head over to the coast for our drive down the coast to Calf.
This is sad. I wasn’t expecting reactions like that so soon. Some speculate it might subside in April like a regular flu. Others say it is unpredictable what we might encounter.Thank you for the link.
{is it just assumed that there are enough of them that all of Seattle is contaminated at this point}No that is not what is assumed.
I think the response so far is appropriate. There's one chance to try to contain the spread of this virus. I'd rather err on the side of caution.
"As suze said, no it is not assumed (by anyone reasonable, that is) that all of Seattle (or the region) is ""contaminated"". ~ Colleen"
"Kirk--I agree. Erring on the side of caution if it can prevent any more deaths is how I look at this. As I said before, this has hit way too close to home for our family, so I am not taking this lightly at all."
"really good website, one of the best that I've come across."
apologies..this relates to post #40 from DelRock.
"I received two emails, one from American Airlines, another one from Delta. American Airlines might rebook your flights if these were made recently so it seems. Delta sent an email about them cleaning the areas. Nothing about rebooking the flights.Some people believe that that new air is circulated, and there is no danger. You are pretty much stuck in the cubicle for a few hours, so that doesn’t cut it for me. I might order some masks for all of us. I am not cancelling plans as of yet. I stopped making any lodging reservations. I might as well get to it and do some research. I can always do it next year.Edited: 9:06 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I don't know who ""some people"" are, but those of us in the aviation industry know that the air is ""new"" about every three minutes. Far better than on a bus or train. Masks are unnecessary unless they make you feel as though you are accomplishing something."
"Anna, here's some info for you, as context:General face mask use is NOT recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). There is no good reason for you to order masks, especially given that they're limited in supply and should be used by those who genuinely need them (patients & caregivers with a communicable illness). As Bob mentioned, air is filtered & circulated on flights. It can seem like an germ incubator, but it's not a great environment for spreading a virus.There are no change fees on Delta flights booked in March, 2020, or for flights booked earlier, with travel taking place in March or April. American's current policy is similar. Your travel dates are farther out, I realize, but I'm adding this in response to your last post. ~ Colleen"
"Yes, Delta changed their policy overnight after taking a lot of flack over this. My husband was caught in it as he purchased his ticket before March 1 and was to travel in April, but with the change he can reschedule without a fee. He expenses all of this of course, but it still comes out of the bottom line for his company. So hopefully in another month or so we will feel more comfortable traveling internationally. Flying through Schipol was bad enough when this started, so I can only imagine what it is like now."
"It’s such an unfortunate subject to have to bring up but it’s the reality right now. We all want our families and everyone, everywhere to be safe and well - so it’s good to be able to hear from locals. What they are feeling and seeing is important because there are so many reports “everywhere” it’s hard to get a real, personal, living there, first hand point of view to help those of us who have trips planned to the area and am trying to decide what to do. Please keep the posts coming."
We're enjoying going out to eat and explore with fewer people around. At this time it seems like a good opportunity.There have been many event cancellations and postponements.https:/…Visit Seattle Updateshttps://visitseattle.org/travel-advisory/

"I just read that Harvard closed classes on the campus. They are going online. If they are closing, what does it say to the rest of the states.

"I was trying to contact American Airlines, but they didn’t pick up my call due to high call volume. I made reservations in February and with Delta in January.Edited: 10:37 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Well, Trump aside...Harvard is hardly the first university to close. UW (Seattle) is closed, for example. A CC near me closed. Neither personally impacts you...unless you have a student at Harvard?For the colleges, it’s a practical choice. They don’t have the staff needed to properly sanitize everything. That would cost a lot of money. They don’t “need” to be open.I think you’ve made your choice but I’d encourage you to take a deep breath. It’s serious, yes, but it doesn’t warrant the level of panic you seem to be experiencing."
Agreeing with Marie's comments.~ Colleen

"What “kind” of people go to Harvard? That’s the strangest post you’ve made yet. All sorts of people go to Harvard—providing they have the money, or a scholarship, or access to loans.I’m not downgrading it. Unless you have risk factors you haven’t told us about, it will, at most, slow you down for a few days. But my point is that the people who go to Harvard, or UW, or heck, a local elementary school, are still out and about. People who would otherwise go to a festival that has been cancelled are still working, traveling, grocery shopping. I’m all for taking precautions. I think it’s smart to cancel festivals, avoid cruise ships.That’s an interesting twist, Wheatie. Any news on whether they’re closing all schools? I mean, that’s the single most common gathering of 250+.Edited: 3:22 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"{I mentioned Harvard because you know what kind of people go there.}What does that mean? What ""kind of people""? And what does that have to do with the pandemic?I think those who are overly nervous about this should not travel at this time. Problem solved."
Seattle Public Schools have announced that they will close for 2 weeks. I think this will be the tip of the iceberg.
"Do you mean, Anna, that you think Harvard people are extra intelligent, so if they're not having face-to-face classes, that Really Means Something? Or....what? I realize some of the measures are intended to slow the spread of the virus, but there's a great deal of inconsistency and illogic at play. Example: Washington State University won't conduct in-person classes after spring break (which is next week). Students will continue to live en masse in residence halls & Greek houses, eat together at campus dining facilities, and so on & so forth ~ just won't be in class together. All righty then!~ Colleen"
"Wow, that’s something. Gotta be parents panicking over that. Jeez, Colleen, that’s nonsensical. Viruses spread like crazy in the dorms and Greek housing. Closing school only makes sense if they close down housing and pay to send the kids home. The main thing that has made me pause travel is that normally, I stay in hostels, and if you get sick in a hostel, it’s sheer misery whether you stay in place or go home. I was thinking about the quarantine panic when I was driving past the Lighthouse Mission yesterday. It’s all well and good to tell people to self quarantine, but that only works of the patient actually has somewhere to “self quarantine”. Homeless? No. Families? No. People with roommates? Nope. So that leaves people like me. I’d stay home if it was possible. But I still have pets, and other responsibilities, so it’s not even plausible that I could lock the door and not go out."
"Exactly, Marie. Much of the reaction gives the appearance of Doing Something. Yes! We are responding! Do not accuse us of inaction! Yada yada. But how do these mandates genuinely play out for the masses, one wonders? The reality is that ""self quarantine""is a matter of equity, not realistic for many (or most, really). Who knows where all the Seattle Public School kids who aren't in school are going to go, what they're going to do, for the next two weeks. ~ Colleen"

{Seems to me likely that at some point in the next year we will all get it.}How - by any stretch of the imagination - are statements like that helpful?
"Wheatie--I figured that announcement came shortly after you posted:) Agree with you, we need to do what we can. My husbands coworker is still in the hospital back east. He was in really bad shape and we wondered if he was going to survive it. My husband was not able to get tested, but was the sickest I have ever seen him and we have been married 31 years. Thankfully he does not have any medical issues, so he was fortunate if indeed this is what he had. At any rate, this is a big deal and I share the same opinion that any little bit I can do to stop the spread is worth it."
"I hear what you're saying, Wheatie (and Mtngirl as well) and value your input. I agree with you to a degree, but not in entirety. And I think much of the speculation, such as conjecturing that at some point within the next year we'll all get it, is unhelpful and ill-advised (no pun intended). ~ Colleen"
"We all need to ""do what we can"" is NOT the same as we're all gonna get it."
Did not mean to cause consternation. Sorry.
"After reading some, I believe there should be a lockdown in schools everywhere. There is an incubation period that lasts two weeks. It spreads too fast. In no time, doctors will have to choose who is going to get to the ICU. Look at Italy. Why wait to see what happens? Why not to prevent it and fight it the best way we can. It will be too late. We should start doing things when we still can.Edited: 12:39 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Locking down preK-12 schools sounds productive, but in fact results in more issues. Consider: what’s to become of the hundreds of thousands of children who aren’t fortunate enough to have stay at home parents they can simply hang out with for weeks on end? ~ Colleen"
They will have no choice if schools will close at a later time but a bit too late then to contain the virus. We are no different.
Anna--Many schools around here are announcing closures. Some for 2 weeks and some for 6 weeks. Our district is in the 6 week camp and I am supportive of that.

"Now, we know why hand sanitizers are hard to get. People saw it as making good money out of it and bought it in thousands on Ebay and Amazon. A bit too late for us. It became illegal after our president declared national emergency. But people were willing to spend $50 for a kit. The same with masks. This should be punishable by law. And I hope they in same way have to pay for it, more what they put into it."
"Nothing that ""our president"" did made the stockpiling of critical supplies illegal. The reason speculators who cleaned out the shelves of masks and sanitizers are now unable to sell is that Amazon and Ebay have barred them, and it serves them right. In addition, several state attorney generals are investigating these profiteers for price gouging. There are state laws on the books in places like Washington that address price gouging during emergencies."
There are more lenient cancellation policies in effect with businesses big and small as a direct result of covid-19 don’t feel like you’re locked into anything. Safety should be top priority.
"Earlier people said it will take about two months for it to die out. Now, there are speculations it could take up to one year. :(After seeing the situation in China, I believe it."
