"I'm considering going to Tanzania in October. (I put down a small deposit - that I'm okay with losing - on a safari yesterday.) I realize that everything could change between now and then, but is anyone actually in Tanzania right now who could comment on the state of things in terms of covid? Are people following proper health protocols and so on?"
"Hello please visit the website then you can read more about COVID-19 protocol but life is going on as normal with all precautions https://www.tanzaniatourism.go.tz/enEdited: 10:33 am, August 04, 2020 "
"Tanzania is basically carrying on as normal. The President has declared that the country is free of coronavirus due to the power of prayer. The president refused to report the number of cases of coronavirus and closed the lab, Tanzanians are not able to get a coronavirus test even if they have symptoms. So really there are no “health protocols”. Back in April and May people were wearing masks and washing hands ...I don’t think they have ever really done social distancing......but now people are just back to behaving normally. There may be some basic precautions in tourist hotels etc but really it is up to you to protect yourself if you can and decide whether you wish to take the “unknown risk” of visiting. If you do decide to go make sure you are good travel insurance because if you do get sick you do not want to end up in a Tanzanian hospital where medical treatment will be very different to a Western hospital And also because you will be taking up one of the few hospital beds that could be used by Tanzanians."
"Hi Shep, thanks so much for your reply. As an American, I hardly have any room to criticize, but it is pretty outrageous what their president has said and done regarding covid. I suppose I was wondering if anyone were around who had recently been on safari in Tanzania or in Zanzibar and could report whether any precautions were being taken in the tourism sector. Great reminder on insurance; I would never dream of going without it. I do think it's interesting that covid-specific travel medical insurance is dirt cheap, indicating that the underwriters think the chances of the client using it are quite low."
"I think realistically you will not find many people on safari there at the moment, tourist numbers are very low for obvious reasons. I suspect some places may be taking some basic precautions but it will very much depend on the individual person, hotel, lodge etc. People have all been told the country is Covid free and they should go about their normal business. I think you have to accept that precautions etc are never going to be the same as those we are seeing at home and levels of hygiene are always going to be variable ......we all know how easy it is to pick up a stomach bug whilst on safari/holiday in Africa....so I would say you need to be responsible for taking your own precautions. And don’t forget to take anti- malarial tablets as well."
"My only input is that you will require a ""Covid19 Certificate "" showing negative and dated within 72 hours of your arrival . This may be tricky coming from Kentucky but it is likely the airline won't permit you to board without seeing it so 72hours before 'check in' will most likely be OK.Everything as Shep states. There are some tourists arriving and I have seen a news report that President Magafuli has asked people to report adverse Covid comments about TZ on social media. Good luck with that."
"Quite right. I'm torn about going. On the one hand, I understand that we're in the middle of a pandemic. On the other hand, I have been in lockdown mode since February, am quite sure I don't have the virus and won't in October, am in a low-risk group, have some N95 masks to take with me for the flights, wash my hands all the time and always carry around hand wipes on vacation and use them before eating and periodically throughout the day, and basically my entire trip to Tanzania would be outdoors other than me being alone in a tent or hotel room. It seems to me like it should be safe, but of course there is still some level of risk."
"mfuwe, I'm aware of that. Why would obtaining a negative covid test within a certain timeframe be tricky in Kentucky?"
"To answer your questions; 1) is anyone actually in Tanzania right now who could comment on the state of things in terms of COVID? YES, basically as a TO on ground I would recommend anyone to Travel to Tanzania especially from October.2) Are people following proper health protocols and so on? Good question! I have been to northern circuit parks for the whole last week and saw a very few numbers of tourists around there. Social distancing, the use of proper disinfectants as well as wearing of mask has become part of daily life. At entry points to the parks, hotels/ safari lodges and camps are all prepared and practising to accommodate guests at that recommended level (as per Standard Operating Procedures) by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism in accordance to Ministry of Health in Tanzania. Parks gates, Washrooms, Safari vehicles and accommodations are all safe and clean but at the end, you should practice all the precautions by yourself.For example, in Serengeti National Park as it is the highest concentrated park there is a designated medical centre for COVID-19 patients. All PPE's are available including respirator and Oxygen machine (for 2 patients at once) . This Post is a holding while patient will be either sent to Fame or Airlifted to Nairobi Hospital by Air Ambulance (AMREF). Thus, In addition to client's insurance subscribed, your Operator has to make sure you get the valid policy from Flying Doctors Emergency Evacuations (AMREF) which will be charged in your quote so you can have the service anytime needed within 30days from your safari start date.Lastly, Good news, today KLM has started its route and just landed in Kilimanjaro for the first time since March. It gives more hope that until October, flights tickets will be available at any desired time by the tourist than now which need you to fit with Airline's schedule (x3 a week!).Donak Safaris experts"
"Donak, thank you! That is very useful information. There seem to be many flight options from where I am. However, I'm not sure if some will be cancelled at the last minute.Regarding the required negative covid test for entry into the country, do you happen to know if the actual test has to be taken within 72 hours of departure, or do you just need your results back within 72 hours? For example, if you're leaving on a Friday, could you get the test done the previous Friday and receive the results by Thursday and be good to go the next day, or would it be invalid because the previous Friday was more than 72 hours before? I know this literally just started so maybe no one knows yet."
"loongcat.""mfuwe, I'm aware of that. Why would obtaining a negative covid test within a certain time frame be tricky in Kentucky?""There are posts on this forum that say getting test results out to you within the 72 hours in USA is problematic. Do a search.Also to answer your other question, I understand your negative Certificate needs to show the test date was within 72 hours of your departure. You will appreciate that if much time has elapsed between the date of test and your departure there is always the possibility that you have been infected in the interval."
"mfuwe, okay, thanks. I was thinking that you just needed the results within 72 hours, not that the test needed to be taken within 72 hours - indeed, that presents a problem. (Side note, test result timelines are variable throughout the country. At my PCP they're taking 3-8 days. It just depends on the lab.) Hopefully by October rapid testing will be ubiquitous. Really appreciate everyone's responses."
"looongcat, try reaching out to PassPort Health, they said they can have results within 72 hours.https://www.passporthealthusa.com/"
"JLB, great idea! Thank you so much. I have used their service once before."
My pleasure
"looongcat, Travel advisory Number 5 of 5th august, 2020 says:-2. All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to get tested for COVID-19 and turn negative, as a condition for traveling , will be required to present a certificate upon arrival. Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to Covid 19 infections , will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested for RT-PCR;On the ground here life goes on but still people are taking precautions on civid 19 virus. Tourism business is starting slowly, at least you can see tourist jeeps with clients moving in the national parks. Our government introduced SOP as guidance for all tourism businesses to make sure those who decide to visit Tanzania are safe as well as those who work in tourism industry too etc.Karibu Tanzania,"
"brightsafaris, wow! That sounds like quite a change from what the policy was yesterday, no?"
"I am planning to travel to Tanzania on 31 August from the US. At this point, no COVID test is required to enter the US. Does your info from Travel advisory Number 5 of 5th august, 2020 mean that I will NOT need a negative COVID test to enter Tanzania? Can you provide a link where I can find the actual Tanzanian requirements? I have not been able to find one. Thanks so much!"
Klick here on Tanzania and yiou'll find the last requirements:https:/…1580226297.htm
"ReiseBeate, I've also been using IATA, but some tour operators, including brightsafaris above, posted a new update from today that seems to be in contrast with what IATA is listing right at this moment, at least. IATA currently says:Published 31.07.20201. Passengers and airline crew are subject to medical screening upon arrival.2. Passengers must have a medical certificate with a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19) test result issued at most 72 hours before departure.3. A completed ""Traveler’s Surveillance Form"" must be presented to the Port Health Authorities upon arrival.Apparently a new travel advisory from 5 August says:All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to get tested for COVID-19 and turn negative, as a condition for traveling , will be required to present a certificate upon arrival. Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to Covid 19 infections, will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested for RT-PCR.So it seems like they're moving this responsibility onto the airlines or other countries unless one has symptoms."
"So I did a little more research and found the article below. It seems as if clarification is coming out tomorrow, 06 August. I have a feeling that this could change a few more times in the coming weeks. My trekking company has already posted that the COVID test is required for entry, so I will have so wait and see, https:/…index.html"
"looongcat, thank you. Yes, it seems they're moving the responsibility to the airlines.So we only can wait and see what happens."
"Of course, regardless of the policy, the right thing to do for everyone would be to get a test before entering the country. The challenge, as has been discussed, is the 72-hour window. That is not the current standard in the US, unfortunately.I understand our current (rightfully) wild and chaotic image to the world, but not every American is running around without a mask going to people's barbecues and parties and bars all night long. Many of us are fortunate enough to be able to work from home, we always wear a mask, and have hardly left our houses since February or March. I would think that those interested in international travel would be more likely to belong to the latter group."
"My wife and I are traveling to Tanzania from the US on September 2nd for 3 nights in Zanzibar and a week on safari on the mainland. I'm keeping an eye on entry requirements closely, but for now, we are planning to try to get a COVID test within 72 hours of departure, but I have no idea if it will be possible to get the results in time prior to our flight. We did go to a drive-up testing site yesterday and get tested to find out how fast we receive the results. However, I wouldn't even know what kind of ""certificate"" they would accept - would just a printout or copy of the test results be sufficient? At this point, it's all very confusing."
"If there is actually a 72 hour rule, enforced on arrival, that means you'll need to have the test taken no more than 48 hours before departure, as it will take the better part of 24 hours to get to Tanzania from the USA... or maybe more, depending on the routing. The reason there is a slow turn around for test results in the USA, is because we dont have enough testing capacity in most areas. And you want a test solely for the purpose of going on vacation? Yet for some reason, folks on this and related forums think it is OK to take a pleasure trip across the globe in this environment? Just not sure what folks are thinking. Yes, Tanzania desperately needs foreign money to literally prevent people from starving. So send your dollars to an appropriate relief organization instead. and STAY HOME!"
"arf1410, I completely understand your perspective."
"Arfl410I completely agree. You can support the people of Tanzania without actually visiting. This is what we plan to continue doing until thing change. Whilst I would love to be back in Tanzania this seems the most sensible thing to do given that we are in the middle of a global pandemic.Edited: 1:34 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"I think it is okay to tentatively plan for the future, knowing that your trip will probably be postponed due to the pandemic.Because Tanzania isn't even testing or seemingly doing much of anything to stop the spread of covid, it's very possible the situation will look much bleaker in October and beyond as the virus gets completely out of control. I really hope their president will see the light and begin testing again asap. Otherwise they're going to lose many more lives, and of course, put tourists off for much longer, which seems to be a primary concern of theirs."
""" Yes, it seems they're moving the responsibility to the airlines.""Not so much that as taking the view that IF the airline has a ""No Cert, no fly"" policy then why test again on entry to the country? If you were clear on boarding back in sunny down town Ann Arbor you are still going to be clear at JRO or DAR.I do tend to agree with the sentiments of arf1410 in that if you are traveling for the altruistic purpose of 'helping a country's economy' you should not bother. The virus can only spread around the globe with travelers . No travel, no spread. Just send a few quid, more if you like, to a deserving cause and stay home frustrating though that is. I have not left home since 1st March and it hurts but I know I am safe here.BUT, I have plans as 'Work in progress', and as soon as it IS safe I am away to TZ but no way will I sit in a tin tube with strangers until then.Edited: 3:15 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"I regard travel to any destination should now depend upon the product of a reliable preventive vaccine. With most vaccines, anyone vaccinated is protected against being infected with the virus, and against passing it on to others. The more people who get vaccinated as soon as that option becomes available, the sooner the world can eradicate the virus -- which requires a host even to be considered ""alive."" When - if ever - the virus runs out of hosts, it will disappear. Until a vaccine becomes available, however, anything you do outside your own home has the potential to become infected and, even if you never develop symptoms, infecting others -- some of whom will also pass it on, and some of whom will die. As long as there is ANY virus cases where you live, you risk being a carrier at least -- and as soon as you get to the airport, you risk becoming infected, regardless of how careful you may be -- because, sadly, not everyone is as careful as you may be and all too many STILL don't understand that you may be infected yet asymptomatic and capable of passing death to some stranger you didn't even know was in the radius of the reach of your breath.I can hardly wait for that vaccine, even though I'm pretty sure we'll have to postpone our February 2021 booking until at the earliest next summer. While the production of an effective and safe vaccine has a decent chance of being available by early next year, distribution to an entire planet is going to take months, at least. There's no guarantee that you or I or anyone we know will be on the list of people they will need to priorities for the first doses that will become available. So -- patience. And if you can, do help Tanzania to weather this storm. They are between a rock and a hard place -- without tourism and us traveling to their country, they have little if any income, and risk widespread hunger. WITH tourism, they risk the spread of this virus beyond where it may be at present. They need our help. But our actual presence is a danger to both them and us. And that is as true of Italy or Singapore or Uruguay as it is of Tanzania. People, in general, need to stay put and those of us capable of helping should do what we can to support countries which count heavily on tourism to survive this economic disaster.I'll keep hoping for February, but I'm thinking our reach will need to be a bit further to be realistic: April prices are low, which would be nice, even given the rains -- or perhaps another dry season and a shot at a crossing at Kogatende. This time should be teaching us all more patience, more generosity, more self-control. It's certainly been teaching me these things. It's also been teaching me online grocery shopping . So there you go."
"sandyleelee, I totally get what you're saying. I have been locked down since February or March myself. (I've been saying February, but now that I think of it, I believe I met some friends to play a board game in March.)But what if we don't have a vaccine for 5 years - or maybe ever? There is some promise right now, but we don't know how long the antibodies will last. So if there is never a vaccine, does that mean none of us should ever travel again? What will happen to everyone working in the tourism industry - and what will happen to the animals, in the case of sub-Saharan Africa? I do think there is a way to travel safely, masked and socially distanced, especially where most tourists' activities are outside, like in Tanzania. But I have all of these questions myself. I'm not sure what the right answer is. I don't think it's safe to assume that a vaccine will be available soon, or that even if it is, that it will really work, since there's going to be quite a bit of opposition by a significant percentage of the population."
"sandyleelee, what a beautiful piece you've written - it brought tears to my eyes. Thank you for sharing your life with me, a total stranger. I am so sorry about your husband's health. I hope you are well. I will be thinking of both of you and hoping you can get back to Africa just as soon as is feasible. Would you mind telling me your favorite parts of Africa? I have never been, other than to Morocco as a student quite a while back. You are right on all counts. You make an excellent point that even a three-week vaccine would be enough for travel. And I would say that requiring tests for everyone to board planes would work now except that the false negative rate for the current covid test tends to be very high. At my own doctor's office it is believed to be 33%! This only adds to your points, of course.I should be more patient. I'm in my early 30s and will likely have several more decades in which to travel. I have already been to 27 countries, so I shouldn't be so greedy. The potential side effects of covid are indeed horrifying. One of my friends, who I believe is 29 or 30, formerly completely healthy, not even an ounce overweight, etc., got the virus and subsequently had two strokes and many terrible accompaniments. Worse, none of the emergency rooms she went to knew how to treat her, or could even truly confirm what had happened. She is slowly improving, but it's just unimaginable. I am so deeply sorry for her. This happened in March, when much less was known, and when we were still being told not to wear masks."
"Well, technically speaking, it won't be my first safari - I went to North India this past fall and had a wonderful afternoon riding bicycles with a Sikh guide at Keoladeo National Park. We spotted over 20 different types of birds, and I was prepared with my binos, which I had purchased for a previous trip to Costa Rica (didn't see too many birds there, but there were sloths, and my favorite - the tiny colorful frogs, mostly nocturnal!). I also went on two safaris at Ranthambore, resulting in two tiger sightings - more than many get to see by their fourth safari there. I would actually like to go back and spend about two days at Keoladeo - it was that much fun. But yes, it will be my first African safari, and you're right - I will start studying, which I try to do before each trip I take. Do you have any specific book or video recommendations? I will definitely read your trip reports. You write so eloquently that I feel I have met my required daily literature quota just from your posts :)"
"You can easily waste a perfectly good year with Stevenson and Fanshaw's Birds of East Africa, which I'm pretty sure is available on Amazon. I take that with me every day in the vehicle, and it supplements my guide's larger collection. For my first safari, I studied the National Audubon Society's Field Guide to African Wildlife. And, of course, there's a a lot of material right here on the internet!You might also consider studying some very basic Swahili. It's an interesting and lovely language, and the people you will meet will be THRILLED if you make the effort -- if you can merely greet your waiter, or the guy who hauls your luggage from the vehicle to your tent, or the guy who welcomes you with a cool face towel and some juice when you arrive at camp with the right greeting (""Hujambo"" more correct than the ubiquitous ""Jambo,"" for example), you'll get the most BEAUTIFUL smile in return. So worth the effort, and a lot of fun to study. There are several basic and very easy to use beginner texts at Amazon -- another way to build excitement, too!We didn't get up to the north when we were in India, so we've missed the tigers, and we had to cancel our trip to Costa Rica we had booked for this past May (for obvious reasons. Sigh.) But the sheer density of wildlife in the Serengeti is going to blow your mind. How long a safari are you planning? I' hope you can manage at least 10 days. And when are you planning to go -- what month(s)? I'm getting excited FOR YOU. I'm really good at having vicarious experiences. LOL. It's part of my charm!"
"Sandyleelee, I have been reading your post for years plus the ones above - Let me say the truth... You are so amazing!!am sorry about your husband's health issues.Tutaonana, Karibu Tanzania Tena."
"Epic writing from Mama Sandy as always. I thought I knew a fair bit about her before today but ""Wow"". I now know a bit more.Like her I have faith in a workable vaccine before too long so still pinning hopes on a couple more trips before the inevitable last one way one to the cemetery. I wonder if they have 'pop top hatches ' on a Hearse? I am so glad I got in my trip to Uganda in February before I was locked down to within 20 miles of my home.Getting off topic of course but mention of Keoladeo brought back memories.Keep smiling. Keep safe. Dream of Africa."
"Thanks sandy,You have summed up my feelings. I too am hopeful of a vaccine or a treatment sometime in 2021 that allows the world to return to some sort of normal. In the meantime our government policies discourage us from travelling and I respect that......it does make sense not to travel. .......though it also makes me sad. We need to get things under control so we can hug our families again and go to the shop without wearing a mask and go to a restaurant without worrying how close we are to the next table. I would love my daughter to be able to have the wedding she has worked so hard for and planned and has already had to postpone twice. I would also love my son to find another job having now been made redundant as the company he was working for has folded due to Coronavirus. I am lucky that I only have these things to worry about and have not lost anyone close to me to this horrible virus, but many are not so lucky. Covid 19 has affected us in many ways and I hope that by respecting the government advice not to travel I am doing my bit to avoid further deaths and or life changing medical issues for others. Once we have a vaccine and life returns to some sort of “new” normal I will be booking those foreign trips but until then I remain at home in the U.K. Thanks again Sandy for writing such great posts."
"Sandy, is it okay if I call you that? Thanks so much - have ordered some books to study, and also downloaded a Swahili app. Already I have noticed several beautiful words, like ""samahani"" and ""lala salama."" The process is reminiscent of early 2019, when I studied Japanese for four months before going on my first cherry blossom trip there. The safari I put a small deposit down for, but don't realistically expect to take, is 6 days on the northern Tanzania circuit in October. I do have until May to use this deposit, so something like February is possible, but again seems unlikely due to the circumstances. We'll have to see. Did you see that someone mentioned on this or another thread that there is actually a covid emergency station in the Serengeti intended to hold tourists until they could be medevaced to a hospital? I thought that was quite something. Meanwhile, locals cannot get a covid test even if they obviously have the virus. SighAlso, have you done the Miracle Experience Balloon Safari or any other balloon safaris, by chance? That one in particular has outstanding reviews. It's a little pricey for my taste but very well could be worth it."
"Sandy, you write beautifully about Africa, and what it means to you. I went to Tanzania in 2001 when I was 44, and, like you, the moment my feet touched the African soil I fell in love. I was on a 2 year VSO placement in Mwanza, and, if not the best 2 years of my life, certainly close. Ultimately I also fell in love with a handsome Sukuma lad, and brought him back to Shetland with me, where we had twin daughters together (me, at the ripe old age of 47!). So now half my heart, and half my family are in Tanzania, and I, too, miss it with a pain that is visceral. I long to go back again, to smell the air after rain, to feel the cool in the hour after dawn, to hear the birds. To speak Swahili, a beautiful, and thankfully fairly easy, language. To go on safari and hear the lions in the night. And yes, the birds!We are in the process of building a house, with the view to spending half the time in Mwanza, half in Shetland when I retire. But who knows whether this will ever be possible now? Although I don't believe in God, I do pray for this beautiful, peaceful, friendly country."
"Shep, my most heartfelt good wishes for your children. Both of those are very disappointing scenarios. I'm optimistic for the future in both cases, though. Sandy, thanks again for all your words of wisdom. First, there is nothing for me to cancel. All that happened is that I gave a tour operator a small deposit that's good through next May, made some hotel reservations in Arusha and Zanzibar that I can cancel, and am watching flight prices. I have not spent any money other than that small deposit. I actually have about eight weeks of vacation each year and would never dream of flying all the way to Tanzania for six days. I was going to stay in the area (Arusha, and maybe visit Moshi) for a few nights both before and after the safari and go to Zanzibar for a total of 2.5 weeks. One issue is that, because I am a solo traveler, it is quite a bit cheaper to join a group that is already going, and the group at the time I wanted happened to be going for six days. I'll admit that I wasn't super particular about it, however.It is true that I am a younger single person with an average income and Tanzania is a more expensive destination than Japan, Southeast Asia, India and other places that I've gone in recent years, and I could not afford to, say, do a 10-day safari in Tanzania, more weeks in Kenya, then head over to Rwanda for a $5000 gorilla trip, etc., at this time - hence the shorter 2.5-week timeline. Before ""settling"" on the plan above, I asked a couple of tour operators if it would be possible to extend the six days and perhaps spend more time in the Serengeti, Tarangire, and/or NCA, and they didn't seem to know what I was talking about - I suppose they are used to tourists wanting to rush through in less than a week. Perhaps I should, using your sage advice, design my own safari, make my own reservations, and then try to find a tour operator to do the driving. I must also mention that I would highly recommend Japan. I was there for 17 days last spring. Polite, hardworking people, everything everywhere is clean, and anything you put in your mouth will be the best thing you've ever tasted, particularly if you eat beef. When I got home, everything tasted like plastic. Also quite affordable."
Susan -- you are a sister-soul. You are.
"I'm not there (I'm in Kenya) but I keep up with several WhatsApp friends in Tanzania. They wouldn't lie to me as they've no real motive to do that to a close friend. What they tell me is the hospitals are not full to brimming and there are no visible traces of mass death (bodies in the streets, big cemetary expansions, etc).Having read about some countries that had steep rises followed by steep drops, I think it may be possible that the virus burned its way through the vulnerable population and is at a low ""R rate"" now, effectively meaning herd immunity may have been reached. I'm not asserting that as a scientist, only inferring it from what I hear.Some new research is suggesting that herd immunity may happen far below 60-70% and some places including Armenia, northern Italy and others may have reached it. In short they ""let it rip"" and the crisis was shortened.Edited: 11:58 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Sandy and Looongcat,Thanks you for your kind words. We are all gutted about the wedding. Our daughter has worked hard and saved the money for the wedding she has planned - it’s soul destroying to have to postpone once but heart breaking to do it twice, especially when we have no idea when wedding receptions will be allowed here in the U.K. (at the moment nothing is allowed - only a small socially distanced ceremony!!).Looongcat - I think Sandy has covered most aspects of a safari that you need to think about. I would start again with your planning and follow her advise. Over the last 10 years we done several safaris (we can’t afford to do them every time we visit Tanzania) which have been anything from 3- 10 days long depending on our budget and time available. One day I would love to go for an even longer safari. I would just add that however long or short our safari is I try and avoid “one night stands” where possible (the only exception I make is at the crater where I personally think I night is sufficient) - Generally I nighters really do mean you are rushing through places and not having enough time to actually sit back and enjoy what you are seeing. When we have done 3 night safaris we spend all 3 nights in one place to make the most of our time. I would say 10/12 days is a good length for a first Safari followed by seeing some other areas of the country and its people. I would go for cheaper safari accommodation and more days rather than less days and more expensive lodges. In reality you are out all day on safari so all you do is shower, eat and sleep at the lodge before you are off out again - so as long as the accommodation is clean and comfortable and the food edible then it’s fine with me. As I mentioned I would also spend sometime visiting places not on the “safari route” and spend some time with Tanzanians who are not involved with tourism,. We spend a lot of time in Moshi (I prefer it to Arusha) and also Mwanza but have also gone off the tourist route completely and spent time in Geita and Chato where you really see what life is like for most Tanzanians. Also these places are VERY cheap to stay in compared to a safari lodge so will make your budget go a lot further. I would spend some time visiting a school, market, local bars and restaurants (not tourist ones) go for hikes in the countryside, visit some lakes or mountains, climb up to a waterfall, visit a coffee or banana plantation. All these things are cheap to do and great fun.Have fun with your planning - don’t rush it"
"Kronick,I am not sure the opinion of a few locals is a reliable source of information. I am i the U.K. right now, I only know one person who has had Covid 19 and I don’t know anyone who has died. None of my friends or relatives have told me about anyone they know who has had it or died - so if you asked me personally based on my experience ...I would say that there is no coronavirus here in the U.K!! However you only need to look at the statistics and number of deaths to no my experience is not correct.....and I would completely wrong!!! Thousands have died here in the U.K......I just don’t happen to know any of them. However I do know of 2 of our friends in Tanzania who have almost certainly had Covid 19 but couldn’t get it confirmed as hospitals had been told not to do any testing.Really I don’t think the opinion of a few individuals can be used to draw any sort of conclusion about the current situation with coronavirus in Tanzania.Edited: 12:10 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"Thanks, Sandy - I will definitely do more research. Completely agree that it would be better not to be in a group, but it's about an $800 difference, which unfortunately is somewhat significant for me. Hopefully someday I'll be able to say otherwise :)"
"I concede that my info is anecdotal. But we're talking about a country where there's little reporting to support any of the narratives. Not comprehensive info from me, but what does anyone else have to offer? I did my best to answer the OP.Tanzania's response has been very different from that of the UK, so the trajectory and current stage of the epidemic there might be quite different. There's also the very different demographics with TZ having an overwhelmingly young population with fewer health complications for the virus to bite into. The UK is a good yardstick to discuss the UK but I don't feel it's as relevant to Africa as some people think."
"Kronick,My comments are not about comparing the U.K. with Tanzania which would be stupid but more about trying to draw some conclusions from the observations of a few individuals. Realistically no-one knows the true situation in Tanzania because as we know, they stopped testing and reporting months ago. I don’t think it is possible to guess what is going on there now so we all have to be responsible for our own actions and how they may affect others both in Tanzania and in our home country. I am not sure trying to make a “guess” as to the situation is useful and may lead to some people drawing the wrong conclusions and reading it as facrt That is what I am trying to say.Edited: 1:52 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"Bear in mind, looongcat, that you are only going by one quote. There may be others who can give you a better deal. It doesn't hurt to explore -- inquiring costs nothing -- you're only looking at one company, I gather."
"I got about six quotes. Safari Soles was the cheapest and has great reviews everywhere. I figure it's just the first time, not the only time, so it's not like it must be perfect.Edited: 4:46 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"Why is this thread full of jibbajabbering about safaris? People are more interested knowing how is the social distancing in general, are the bars and clubs open with restrictions etc."
Hi ... I am in Dar es Salaam atm. Arrived here on Monday. The country continues their normal walk of life...a simple temperature test at the airport and a health form to fill in. I seem to be the only person I've seen since my arrival using a mask and carrying a hand sanitizer with me.
"Which airline company you used? Another thread there's a recent post that in Zanzibar they require a negative Covid test but this is not the case in Dar?Edited: 3:16 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"Thanks very much for the update, Pragasen N. Stay well and safe please."
