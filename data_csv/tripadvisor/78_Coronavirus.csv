"We are planning a trip to Scotland in early May. Although we are personally not terribly concerned at this point by the coronavirus situation, we do have one question. Are the government's precautions likely to impact either our travel to and from Scotland or the ability to see the sights whilst there? I know this is in part a request to foretell the future, but if there are any indications as to what the Scottish government is likely to do which would affect us, we'd appreciate knowing what is the current thinking."
Nobody knows. It depends on what happens with Covid-19
"As predictable as whether the US government will let you leave the country, which you presumably don't know either."
"Only one case in Scotland to date!The UK Government announced its contingency plans today (see BBC News for details, including a press conference with the Prime Minister)There are no plans to “shut” the Country down so Attractions Etc will remain open!That’s not to say this could not change in the future!"
The current thinking is outlined in the UK govt's action planbedtime reading!https:/…
It's like asking what the weather will be like in May.... nobody has a clue ! It's a fast developing situation and anything could happen in the coming weeks. Or maybe nothing will.We'll just have to wait and see. Sorry can't be more helpful.
"We are also watching this as our 10 yr anniversary is last week of April. We have trips insurance, but that will not cover all things. Also, we are looking hard at flight changes/cancellations (so far British Airways has not cancelled the flights from New Orleans to Heathrow). Another consideration is the going out of country and getting back in.... I really do not recall SARS or MERS being this bad, globally. Any new news, pls keep posted here. Combing through so many versions of the news is sometimes very difficult. I have utilized a lot of what you wonderful people have talked about to help plan this trip. Thank you all for the help with it."
"Getting back in is entirely down to your own Government, nothing to do with ours.Just don’t rely on US Media outlets! If you must rely on the media then stick to the Beeb!Or read up on the official ScotGov link already provided!"
"I'm going to repeat what Madscotsman said.Please don't just google the newspapers. So many do and come up with the daily rags that sensationalise to sell.Stick to the Scotgov link and BBC news website. While it can have it's moments of emphasising the negative, it's updated as it happens https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/scotlandSo far everything is going on as normal. Bring your own hand gel. 60,million people have been told to use it repeatedly but no one thought about ensuring there were enough stocks in place!"
"< 60,million people have been told to use it repeatedly >Soap, hot water and the ability to sing Happy Birthday twice is all you need - and better than hand gel"
My singing is awful. Is it ok if I just speak the words instead ?
According to the Supreme Leader you have to sing it.
"Alanrow there is no hand get available in over a 50 mile radius, toilets/washrooms have all been closed due to government cuts in funding and cafes are on winter opening, if at all. Though there is enough water around in the floods.My DIY hand sanitiser is made from Vodka. It has the dual ability to be able to be used as a mouthwash too ;-)Edited: 5:07 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"""My DIY hand sanitiser is made from Vodka.""As the OP is visiting Scotland I think Glen ""Somthing-or-other"" might be more appropriate."
"Jimmy, I did use some blended scotch the first time. It was what I had in the house. Can't afford the good stuff these days. The increase in price must be some sort of revenge on the English.But for something that's sprayed on door handles and the like I'd rather waste Vodka"
"A Doctor on the Lunchtime News today said much the same, soap and water, and unless the hand Gel has at least 60% Alcohol in is it’s useless!Up in Scotland we sing the Altered Images version!"
35% by vol. It will have to be a double then.So it's soap and a puddle then as we have no washrooms open round here.
"'Up in Scotland we sing the Altered Images version!' Better to sing 'I Could Be Happy' ... all of these things I do, get away, run away, far away, how do I escape from you. Perfect lyric when addressing the virus."
"As Toopaz says, don’t take your lead from the media. Look to Government advice (both home and away). As I posted on another thread:“ No one knows, just as no one knows whether and how far/how fast it will spread where you live.You need to watch for Government advisories and not base your decision on media hype. Remember, if a second person is diagnosed in a particular country, “two people have Coronavirus in X country” isn’t a headline; “numbers of people diagnosed has doubled in the last week” certainly is. Same story but the second sounds more dramatic.”"
"""35% by vol. It will have to be a double then.""A double is still 35% by vol! Although I'll assume you were being humorous. And if you were, I laughed!"
"IKR, we have both at our disposal. And I did not say thanks earlier for the links about the news. Thanks. They are helpful as well. I agree about the whole sensationalism regarding the news. The same happens when we have a hurricane threat in south US. Then they end up showing a good breeze and then say the winds are kicking up stronger, lol."
"""Ability to see the sights"" may depend on what sights you want to see. Hiking in Glencoe, for example - no problem.But it is conceivable that venues where a high concentration of people are in a small space - Museums, Art Galleries, Edinburgh Castle - could close. But right now, it's impossible to say what will happen."
"Scotland is very sparsely populated. Apart from its half a dozen cities, most of the spectacular parts are not the cities.To date, only 3 cases of Coronavirus have been specified. Normal hygiene and you'll be fine."
"Alexander, I'm reading this same ""you'll be fine"" advice all over the forums.But the OP is *not* posting out of concern of getting infected. Their concern is whether any measures that the government might put in place would have an impact on their holiday. ""Normal hygiene"" will not make a closed museum re-open, a cancelled flight put back on, or get you out of a quarantined hotel."
"No-one knows. Think of the worse case scenario and decide whether you can cope with it. The country seems to be as ready for Coronavirus as one can be. On a positive note some restaurants are a little quieter and tables easier to book. I'm off to gargle with vodka and wash my hands with soap and water until I complete a hearty rendition of God Save the Queen once, or Happy Birthday (Altered Images version) twice. Happy days."
"According to a Chinese Restauranteur I know, Chinese Restaurants and Takeaways are feeling the pinch just now!"
There is no sense worrying about it. I personally am more worried about United canceling my flight in June than I am about Scotland having restrictions.
"I've booked to come to Edinburgh next week on the train. Must admit I'm having 2nd thoughts, especially if places like the castle are closed. Will keep checking"
"I agree, if the Tourist attractions you want to visit are closed, you might want to rethink your trip. If you are staying self catering in a remote location and spending all your time in the great Scottish outdoors, then you will be fine until lockdown restrictions apply."
Staying in centre of Edinburgh air bnb so no refund available unless exceptional circumstances
"Right now, there are plans to close venues of over 500, so that affects theatres and concerts from Monday, but there are no specific plans as yet for other places like the Castle, as far as I know. That's from the Scottish government.Westminster seems to be saying they're going to wait a while.Meantime many organisations are making their own decisions, which might or might not follow government guidelines. Redwimp, there's little likelihood of a voluntary refund, so you might as well let things run until just before you leave. Do you have any insurance? it's too late to buy it now as existing 'events' would be excluded."
We were also scheduled to be in Scotland for our 10th anniversary end of April. Watching how this all unfolds. A fluid situation to say the least...
"I certainly think that travel limitations enforced by Governments due to a pandemic are exceptional circumstances !!Edited: 4:33 am, March 13, 2020 "
I should add.....WHEN they happen!
"""Highland Games might be affected ... we simply don't know yet.""Some will definitely be affected. Decisions already been taken. Expect confirmation soon."
"No insurance no, but that wouldn’t cover if I just decided not to go because of the risk anyway.I think it’s just the prospect of some of the attractions closing, the train journey etc. which makes us nervous"
Me and my husband are due to go to Scotland on the 15th of May by coach I don't know what do do either we are going to loch Lomond it will or supposed to be our first holiday .
"# 27, airlines will do their utmost to fly passengers or they'll lose large amounts of revenue. We're flying to JFK in June with Delta and wild horses won't stop us."
My husband and I are flying into Edinburgh for a two week trip at the end of April. We currently have all of our fingers and toes crossed that the worst will be behind us by then.
We are flying to Edinburgh from Germany to do a one week trip with a campervan in mid-April if our new flights won’t be cancelled. We will only stay in remote locations and have been working in home office for three weeks already now. So fingers crossed. We thought about canceling but we won’t get our money back so decided to be as careful as possible at the airport but still try to go....
"""We thought about canceling but we won’t get our money back so decided to be as careful as possible at the airport but still try to go....""Oh dear......"
"#42........ Are you serious? stay at home,DO NOT travel here, the UK government says""avoid non essential travel"" What do you mean by ""remote locations"" campsites are closing, do you intend to trespass?,?how will you get fuel? food? Remote where? Is there no limit to the selfishness of people ? ( and I managed not to swear once)"
"John m - wild horses may not stop you but the might of the US Dept of Homeland Security definitely will unless the current advice changes, which means us all isolating as much as possible to stop the spread of the virus. I hope you get there in June."
"Meknm, please read and hopefully all these hard facts will help you reach an informed, sensible decision:https:/…explainers-51632801Edited: 5:53 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"I cancelled my trip last week had an idea this was where we were heading, think was a wise choice"
"PS... why is your campervan rental company still operating? do they not understand ""non essential travel.after all, do they not define it?. All scottish schools are closed, doctors surgeries are locked and you need to phone to gain entry, Rural populations are crying out for tourists to stay away, Have you not heard, there is a global viral pandemic?"
"Guys, I am SORRY, I did not mean to be insensible. We talked to the embassy a couple of days ago and they said if we're healthy there is no prob. Situations changed drastically and next to writing the post I was on the phone with our airline to get the flight cancelled!Campervan rental will still charge us though.Edited: 6:00 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"'Campervan rental will still charge us though""If they do claim on travel insurance."
"yes, we'll try but travel insurance won't cover due to the pandemic situation - we already talked to them about a week ago.thats why, a couple of days ago, we decided to go - as we saved money a long time for this trip.edit: we're not going!Edited: 6:06 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Fair enough, name and shame campervan firm utter rogues should be ashamed of themselves, as said, non essential travel is their business, they should all cease trading NOW, we ourselves and other local businesses will lose out big time financially, this cannot be a priority at the moment."
"I don't think any company can refuse to refund money for a holiday paid in good faith, and before the pandemic hit us. How can they live with themselves for behaving in this way? I agree, name and shame, but before you do that, tell them you are going to put it on Trip Advisor. Their behaviour is astonishing given the circumstances. I'm sure they don't want to lose money but quite honestly, neither do the hundreds of thousands of businesses across the country who are in the same situation. I'm sure when All this settles down you will be eager to come back and enjoy the trip you had planned and saved for, for so long. I feel we could really be looking at long term restrictions. Think September or even October, especially if people in the UK, and by that I mean residents, not visitors, fail to take this crisis seriously. The Government should have locked down the country last week, if not before that! All this shilly shallying is just what the virus needs. Rant over ( for the moment!)"
"Absolutely, they should do the right thing. Is Tripadvisor going to do the right thing? I have two properties booked in July, 1 in York and 1 in Edinburgh and from the information I've found so far I cannot get my deposits back. If you treat people like this in times like these they will not come back."
"we are going to Edinburgh in July, from USA, do you think restaurants, hotels and shops will be open"
"@Christine F if you do make it to Edinburgh then be prepared for lots of restrictions to be in place.No one currently knows what will happen, but July will certainly not be ""normal"" no matter what."
