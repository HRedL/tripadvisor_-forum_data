"All international destinations, except for hotspots like Brazil, are level 3."
"Not all countries are level 3, best to check destination before planning a visit, for example New Zealand is level 1. Best to be informed and not rely solely upon wishful thinking.*******************https:/…coronavirus-new-zealand"

"Right move for NZ, bad news for US. B/T/W what is situation in Broward?"
"@Bobcat - I am in Martin/St Lucie County. We just had our death rate here spike in last week. The local municipalities have mandated mask wearing in public places but enforcement is a problem and we have too many ""constitutional scholars"" who feel their rights are threatened by wearing a face covering in public. SAD."
Okay Johnny -thank you-be safe and well.
