"@Lucy C - there are still flights going to Majorca - for example ,Vuelling are flying today from my local airport .If you are prepared to travel, then the FCO advice is just that - advice. And others have said ,you can get insured ,albeit more expensive."
"Encouraging people to continue to travel against government advice is extremely irresponsible. The better advice would be to wait and see if the ban is lifted by the time of expected travel, or switch to a different destination that is not included in the ban."
"I have a holiday booked for 28th august and i really hope i am going, just hope they have lifted the restrictions by then."
Lucy C have to agree with you. Not sure going against advise is a good idea. People taking the risk probably do not care if they get covid or who they may infect alone the way. Missing holidays for one year is not the end of the world.
@Lucy C - Re post 4 - rubbish - adults are entitled to make their own minds up . You are much more likely to catch it in some of the towns around the UK currently - some pubs are almost bursting at the seams!!
"Unfortunately Dave, there are some that do need to be reminded that whilst a global health emergency is taking place, perhaps it might be a good idea to follow the rules that have been put in place to mitigate the spread of an invisible, initially symptom-free, highly contagious virus. You know, perhaps instead taking it abroad with you, putting pressure on other health systems. Or unwittingly bringing it back to this country, adding pressure to our own health system. Perhaps it might be an idea just to be a little less selfish at the moment, and give a thought to others who have no choice but to suffer the consequences of the thoughtless actions of others. The ones who would ‘make their own minds up’ are the very ones helping to give this virus traction. It’s a little inconvenience in the short term, in order to save lives, maybe even your own life Dave. Think about that.Edited: 11:49 am, August 03, 2020 "
"Loving how some folk correlate their chances of catching C19 to how busy their local pubs are ! Its that attitude and the ""I will make my own mind up regardless of medical and government advice"" brigade that are prolonging this whole debacle for everyone."
"Could you be any more patronising Lucy. Get over yourself. People come on here for advice around holidays, not to be lectured thanks all the same."
"I've a jet 2 flight on 16th August,I've cancelled my hotel as I can't have 2 weeks off work quarantined and my son can't either as he is at school when we arrive back ! I'm just hopefully waiting for jet 2 to take notice of the FCO advice and offer me a refund or voucher for my £473 !"
"Truth hurts sometimes doesn’t it. Never mind, we will still be here to treat you and save your life (hopefully) when you get blue lighted into A&E. Prevention is always better, and I’ve seen the consequences of this be deadly, but not everyone can see the bigger picture. And aggression is the default response. Please stay safe everyone."
"Well said Lucy .... I’ ve had to cancel 2 holidays , 1 in Italy and 1 in Mallorca . Disappointing but hopefully it is only for this year ."
Holiday forum Lucy. Remember that. Last time I checked the government was advising not ordering people not to travel.Get of your soap box and get a life.
"My responses have been replies to #3 and #8. I didn’t change the subject, I answered the OP question then poor advice was given by someone else. Please keep up, my suggestion was the measures are in place to protect all of us, and we all should be following them. Then each of us might then be afforded the luxury of a holiday to our chosen destination when it is safer for us all to do so. It’s a shame to have to re-explain something so basic but here we are."
"Hi Lucy, #2,4,6,9,14,17 Understandable if you are unable to holiday this year , assuming it was Cala D'or as you are on this forum , and feeling a bit down as we would all do but no reason for you to preach to others rights and wrongs.""Driving from UK "" asking for advice of people who have done the trip. Your helpful response #18https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g187…""Inflatables Los Cristianos"" Asking for advice if can be used on beach and sea. Your helpful response #6https:/…107476554This forum has been very good with people helping people and sure you may find it useful also.Stay safe."
"WOW. Bit Creepy that Don. Someone has their panties in a bunch! The facts are the facts, wether you like them or not. And thanks, I am doing my best to stay safe, as I hope you are too."
"Lucy if I want health advice I will look in the appropriate place. I don't expect to be patronised or preached to on a holiday forum. Contrary to what you seem to think , most people are well aware of what the restrictions are and what government advice is. I for one, don't need anyone on here to tell me. I have my own brain and my own mind."
"@Lucy C - Final word from me, we will have to agree to disagree. Personally, we have made the decision NOT to travel this year but that is OUR choice."
Seems unfair to target one poster when at least three others on this thread agree with her. I haven't the inclination to go through Lucy's posts but from what I recall she has always been a helpful contributor. It's pretty obvious how much she loves the island - something we all share in common.
"Some folk are just more Covid paranoid and see it as a mass epidemic slaughtering millions of people every day and view every approaching stranger with horror.Others see it as a very low number of deaths now, very low infection rate (1 to 2 is 100% increase) and most people who do have symptoms don't really notice, measures in place are destroying the economy maybe forever.2 sides of the same coin.Our choice is now not to go purely because everyone has - or may - have to pretend to quarantine for 2 weeks on return (which is what people do) and our insurance would have been invalid because of FCO advice (Covid was covered)"
Wish it was still just an epidemic. That would mean it was restricted to a region or a country. This pandemic has affected all but one continent - Antarctica. Lucky penguins.
"Forgot to say, I’ll stick to answers on google. Disgusted tbh!!"
Sorry we won't be hearing from you again Kim. It is a travel forum you're absolutely right but it's understandable that most travel discussions may include the current pandemic. It is not at all off topic or unrelated. Obviously if you need statistics and up to date advice you're right to go to the direct sources.
"Well done to Carolyn with her first post on the forum and samsung131 not only answering her question but slipping in “nice to say please “. Didn’t it go slightly off topic, getting a bit heated but in the end we must have learned something which is what the forum is all about.  We have also had discussions with our kids in the last day or so of us flying to Glasgow this w/e, staying in a hotel, just for 3 days as one of the very rare occasions when all the family, from London & France, will be together but shot down from all directions for even suggesting it. Not just because we are coming from Spain but they just don’t want us to travel full stop until totally safe to do so again. Stay safe also and look forward to your holiday whenever that will be."
"Covid survival rate is 98.54%. Statically you’ve got more chance of falling out of bed and dying, all a load of nonsense"
“A load of nonsense”? I’ll pass on your reassurances to the families of friends who died or who remain seriously ill and to those left with long term health problems and to the people trying to keep your friends and family safe by taking the virus seriously.
Ditto post #32. Nothing like this has occurred throughout the world for over 100 years.

Ditto post #32.
"We've already had 2 holidays cancelled this year. Majorca & Menorca. Now we are due to fly out to Majorca on 2/9. (All holidays were booked 2019). The hotel we booked has given us a credit note as they have decided to close for this year. However the flights with Easyjet I assume will go ahead. Unfortunately we will not be going. I lost my mum to Covid in April and I do not want to risk getting on a plane. We could have booked another hotel if we had wanted to travel. I really don't understand if government as saying only essential travel, how people are still allowed to travel. We couldn't do the 14 days quarantine either as I work and wouldn't be able to take the extra time off. Such a shame, but I would sooner be safe & healthy than worry about catching this awful illness. I think Trip Advisor is always a great way of keeping up to date on everything and use it a lot to give reviews and be as helpful as possible. Keep well everyone and enjoy the rest of summer, where ever you decide to spend it. x"
"Hi Louria #36 Not sure if you know but you can change your Easyjet flights free of charge to next year if 14 days or earlier before flights. You just need to pay the difference in flight prices. Easyjet have also offered to let you have a voucher instead if flying to Spain (but you have to phone them for this), Majorca etc which is what I have done for my flights. Hope this helps"
"hol39.. Thank you for answering my message. If I call and can get through, would you know when the voucher would need to be used by? Would prefer a voucher so we could sort out hotel later on, for next year. Don't particularly want to have to book a flight now for next year! Didn't realise we could do this. Much appreciated."
Hi hol39. I've just called Easyjet and managed to get a voucher. Thank you SO much for the helpful advise. Take care.and keep well x
"Think the cut off for the voucher is a year from it being issued but you dont have to have flown by then just booked flights by then. Also I thought after my post I got an email off Easyjet about 4 days before travel giving me the options if I didn't want to fly. I was due to fly 1st August to Majorca and the quarantine and FCO advice had changed the weekend before. So they were also offering to change flight without a flight change fee even though within 14 days of travel. I'm not sure whether they are offering the voucher option closer to the time, maybe seeing if FCO changes but you could phone and ask."
That's great. Glad you got sorted

People like you are just bitter. It’s a forum not a political debate. What have you said about the doctors and nurses that have gone on a holiday? Are they terrible too!! Get a life
"it could be if you have a life limiting illness, for us it could be the last holiday we will have. this a reply to LucyEdited: 9:28 am, August 19, 2020 "
