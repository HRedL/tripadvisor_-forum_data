"I'm not worried about getting sick. As many have said, more people will die from common US influenza, dengue, accidents, etc.I am worried about enjoying my long planned expensive trip. I don't want to wear mask. I don't want to think twice about eating street food. I don't want to notice and be aware of someone coughing or sneezing. I also, don't want to find myself in the position getting caught up somewhere because one of us has a fever or the possibility air travel is effected. I will go another time. My 2 cents."
If those are the reasons you would never leave home.
"You have more confirmed cases of coronavirus in your own country than in Vietnam, make sure not to step out of your front door while you're at it."
"What a completely stupid attitude to take, why bother leaving your home town for the rest of your life. Have traveled to the far east for over 20 years and the only places that have made me unwell are high end hotels 3 times meals at the hotel have made me unwell, never from street food restaurants or there toilet facilities. Get a grip you have more chance of being run down by a bus or a plain crash..."
"Up to the OP if they want to cancel their holiday, no reason to give them any abuse for it surely ?"

Couldn't agree more jaynewcastle11. We have travelled extensively over the years and just back from SE Asia and if I'm going to catch the novel Coronavirus I'd rather it was in my own country with Immediate access to good medical care.
"A person explains why they are cancelling their trip.Makes no accusations, just explains the reasons for his/her decision.And then gets attacked.Disgraceful. Scott"
I did the same and for the same reasons as you. Everyone has to evaluate their own comfort level. I know this decision was not taken lightly and without cost. Next year!
"I too have cancelled as it's supposed to be a holiday. I;m getting far too anxious.The situation is changing too rapidly and one could find oneself quarantined having taken every precaution. It's simply got a bit too risky for me. I consider that it all comes down to one's appetite for risk and the ability to place things in ones own, often self-defined, perspective."
"Totally agree! I am also cancelling my trip for all these reasons. Everyone has to make decisions so they are most comfortable. I love food and markets and I don't want to wear face masks, fever screenings at airports, possible quaratines because somebody on a flight has a fever etc...not a fun vacation for me at all."
"Yeah, I'll never leave my house right?? Man the ignorance from the keyboard warriors. Reasons like enjoying my vacation or not getting stuck somewhere? Yeah, if those reasons where present you are right, I would not leave my home.I've traveled all over the world with my family of 4 and quite frequently one of us gets a cold or something. This is NOT the time, if you can prevent it, to be traveling no matter what is said.I would much rather be stuck in familiar surroundings, where I know the lay of the land, than stuck where I don't. I'll be back, but not when I need my temperature checked to return home."
"I agree with you OP, I am cancelling my trip in February for the same reasons.This is bigger than everyday motor accidents and such.China has issued the largest quarantine in human history. The country has put 16 cities on lockdown, affecting an estimated 46 million people.It’s the first time in 50 years that the U.S. has issued a mandatory quarantine order.Governments are taking this VERY serious, and this has only been known for less than a month."

"I am going to monitor the situation best I can. We are booked to leave for Hanoi at the end of March. Bloody virus better not keep me from seeing my son after a year ☹️Edited: 5:45 pm, February 03, 2020 "
I'm in the same boat. I am going to monitor the situation. We are not leaving until early April. It is our family's first trip in Asia so I want it to be a positive experience. Having said that I may not be able to afford not to go... I see my travel insurance doesn't cover pandemics or epidemics.
"It is of course purely your choice if you decide not to go, as things currently standThere e many tourists here enjoying their holidays of courseI've been travelling SE Asia since late December, the last 4 weeks in Thailand and now Vietnam"

I am going in march to the grand prix and airfare today is cheaper than when we booked 6 months ago
"If that is how you feel, it is better you cancel your trip then !!However, there will NEVER be a time that travel is 100% risk free, that is why we take out travel insurance !Travel safe !Keith"
that is why we take out travel insurance !======================================Are epidemics and pandemics covered?
I have booked for June flights And accommodation all paid for my travel insurance does not cover epidemics or pandemics ...so if we cancel we loose all the money we paid .... I’m just going to wait and see how the next few months playout then make my decision to cancel or not . Everyone should check there travel insurance
"This thread has been useful. We're about to leave next week for 21 days in Vietnam. We were feeling comfortable (Vietnam seems to have things under control) until the latest developments in Italy and Korea, where it has blown out rapidly. Not too fussed about getting sick (the odds are low) but would not like to be caught up in a regional lockdown and/or be worrying about getting a cold and being quarantined even for a few days because it looks like the virus.Also not sure how much the ""experience"" of Vietnam will be altered. Have been three times and am looking forward to sharing it with my partner who has never been. But if it all happens behind masks, if streets are empty, if vendors are not cooking or are keeping their distance then it will be markedly different.On the other hand, if visitors are fewer it might be heaps better!!!Not making a decision till Friday - nearly all our bookings can be cancelled or transferred to a future date without penalty."
"We're in exactly same boat as Tony, up until S.Korea, Italy and Iran it was a go for us, but now we're leaning towards moving our holidays till end of the year. We also can cancel most of hotels, so not big financial hit, will wait till Friday and decide."
"@nfrank, That is EXACTLY why we cancelled our trip. I really wanted to go back to SE Asia and was SUPER excited about going. I was questioning about our decisions to cancel at first but after reading lots about the virus, having those restrictions and worries, it was just not worth it. I would rather enjoy our trip fully without worrying about not to eat this n that, what not to do and where not to go or where we cant go. We are still bummed out but hey, Vietnam will always there! Thanks for your post!"
"""Are epidemics and pandemics covered?""Depends on your travel insurance policy conditions. If WHO / FCO advises against travel to a country AFTER you have booked, then you will probably get a refund, but as far as this current virus is concerned I am not aware that is the case, so answer is NO !I would still be more concerned about catching Dengue Fever (or involved in a road accident !) while in Vietnam than catching this Corona virus.As far as I read, Vietnam is taking extensive measures to contain the spread (ie closing schools / universities and signs everywhere reminding sensible preventative measures to take)."
"I am NOT bringing this post up from Jan 30th to say I told you so or rub it in but, rather ask those of you that thought it was a good idea to attack my post and personal beliefs to remember that next time. Turns out I was correct but, even if I wasn't, I was attempting to make the best decision for my family which we all should do. I wanted to pass on, what I believed, to be good reasons to cancel in the hopes it would cause others to at least consider the best decisions for them and their families.Think and consider other ways, or none at all, to respond to posts in the future. Be well and take care of those around you."
