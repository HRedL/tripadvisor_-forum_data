"Hi All DE's,I have been advised by the Travel Doc to consider a pre exposure rabies shot. I have travelled to SE asia before and not taken one however I have never been to Cambodia and have only recently heard that it's a bit of an epidemic. Is this the case? My partner and I only wish to travel to Siem Reap then bus it to PP then to Kampot. I reckon we will only be in the country a maximum of 3 weeks and doubt that we will wander around villages as this shall be our first time. If a rabies shot is required should I consider getting it in Cambodia or my home country (which is ££££!). I thank you all kindly in advance and would apreciate your comments.Bianca"
"It's NOT an epidemic. Avoid dogs,monkeys and bats when you can, you wil be fine."
"I think your travel doc is way over-reacting but I'm not a travel doc! If it was me, I'd be finding another travel doc - I've been to all of those places a couple of times and rabies has never been even on the 'to think about' list.I keep my hep A, typhoid and tetanus vaccinations up to date and use bug spray to keep the mozzies at bay - no cure for dengue so you have to avoid being bitten and since you are taking precautions to avoid being bitten by dengue mozzies, malaria mozzies will be stopped too."
"Wow! Fast responses! Thank you both!I guess if worst happens then I'll get the shot. But other than that I will 100% stay away from dogs, monkeys and bats... I have a fear of dogs anyway. Most of all I'll enjoy my holiday! :)"
"Hello Bianca,Please read this:tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g293939-i9162-k…Best regards. Ian"
Cheers Ian! I'll certainly practice caution when there. I am up to date on all of my other shots and if the worst happens I won't be far away from a hospital. I was considering buying a dog repellant device (sound emmiting) so I may well do so.
"Bianca,Please relax a little.It is most uncommon for typical tourists to be concerned about Rabies.Yes, those people working regularly in the hamlets are well advised to have the Rabies series of shots, as indeed have I, but it is not necessary for average tourists.But please remember that those very cute monkeys and their babies are WILD animals so be ultra cautious when in their presence. Apart from Rabies, I've seen wild monkeys remove large chunks of flesh from people!All best regards. Ian"
"Hiya Ian,Yeah I'm very wary of monkeys! As cute as they are I'd rather watch them from afar. I've seen what they can do to people when I was in Malaysia! :)Will be doing fairly touristy things so I'll take heed of all of your advice and relax. Tbh I wasn't even thinking about a rabies shot until the travel nurse suggested it but then again she suggested JE & I know for sure we won't need that! As always the TA community have helped vastly! Thank you all so much! :)"
