"I was reading the Nassau Guardian. The director of labor was quoted, he hopes to have things turned around in the Bahamas by October. This was when referencing unemployment . I hope it does not take this long, for the great people of the Bahamas and families like mine who can’t wait to go back to help stimulate their economy . Our June trip, I feel is looking doubtful ."
"Her's the thing -- the vast majority of our visitors come from the USA. Until the US gets COVID-19 under control, the Bahamas borders will remain closed so as not to jeopardize the health of our people. This isn't going to happen anytime soon -- particularly with no cohesive national plan and each state left to their own devices. People are still flying to Hawaii for vacation, for goodness sake's! So, even if the Bahamas gets COVID-19 under control, there will be no significant tourism until the USA is COVID-19 free. That won't happen much before Nov/Dec, imho. We look forward to welcming everyone back, but only when it's safe to do so. Please be patient, and everyone, stay safe!"
"Currently, the IHME model shows the first day in the US with no deaths will be June 20. There will still be people recovering, though and there could be a second wave."
"Does the HME model take into account the disparity in different states and how each is handling the crisis? Some states currently have no restrictions in place, others just a few. Until there is a national plan and a consistent one, I don't see how the US can get this virus under control throughout the entire country, or there will be constant reinfection hot spots cropping up."
"Yes, the IHME is for the US as a whole, with each state evaluated individually based on what is being done locally and added together to come up with the total numbers for the US. Dr Brix gets an daily update from all states at 2 a.m. and then the modeling experts crunch the numbers, update the model based on real data, then revise the model where necessary. You can see the daily results of the modeling here: https:/…united-states-of-americaThere is a drop down box at the top that is labeled ""United States of America."" If you click on it you can choose any of the 50 states to see not only not only what type of orders the citizens of the state are under -- which is taken into account in the model -- and the projections for resource use and deaths. All of these are added together to get a total projection for the country.I totally disagree that a one-size-fits all approach is needed. Why should Arkansas have to be under the same restrictions as New York? AK has no stay at home order (but I can guarantee you they are still social distancing, wearing masks, etc. Their total projected deaths is 199, even though they are not as restrictive as New York (13463 deaths). The dynamics of the two states are vastly different, so the restrictions should not be the same.Speaking of New York, they are turning the corner. The daily deaths are in decline, there are more being discharged from the hospital than new admittances. I, for one (of many) am very pleased that there is no orders from the federal level on what all 330 million should be doing. The federal level is slow and bureaucratic. Instead of one team fighting this for everyone, we have 50 teams responding to what is needed in their state. Last Monday, based on how things are being handled, the death projections for my state (TX) dropped from over 6000 to 2042 and we will come nowhere near the limits of our resources (beds, ICU beds, invasive ventilators).Like I said above, a second wave is in the realm of possibilities, but Dr Fauci does not seem as concerned about that as the current wave. He says by then we will be much better equipped to respond. Testing will be well-established with adequate supply of PPE and we will be able to quickly identify, isolate, do contact tracing, quarantine those contacts, etc. And of course we will still be social distancing, washing hands frequently, etc. All of this will help prevent any outbreaks from getting to a level where stay at home orders are needed. Most will be able to go about their business except for the most vulnerable.Edited: 12:15 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"Whoops, it's Dr Birx, not Brix."
Good stuff cnj
"Thank you for the detailed explanation. I wish I could be as optimistic. All it will take is a few infected people travelling again to restart the surges in large populated areas. And there is new evidence coming out of South Korea that even those recovered are not entirely immune to reinfection. I've also seen some experts suggest this virus may also be mutating -- making reinfection, as well as a vaccine far more challenging. Of course, no one really knows what will happen, as this is such a new crisis - and even the experts are updating their insights literally on a daily basis. Either way, this is going to be a lengthy process. I'm very proud of our Bahamas leadership for taking immediate action as soon as the first case appeared in the Bahamas. This, added with the lockdowns, curfews and other measures will hopefully spare us the worst of this scourge. Time will tell how we've done, but even if we get things under control quickly, our borders will likely remain closed until other areas have done the same."
