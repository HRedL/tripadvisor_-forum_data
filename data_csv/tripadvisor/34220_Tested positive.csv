Has anyone had the test on arrival at the airport and tested positive? It would be interesting to know what your experience was after testing positive. Thanks
"I believe that a Health Official will contact you and you will go to an approved Hotel.I believe a second test is done after 7 days.Edited: 2:59 am, August 21, 2020 "
"5. Positive test result for COVID-19 diseaseMandatory confinement, if necessary compulsively, for a period of 14 days, in a health establishment, in the respective home or in an accommodation establishment (in case you are in a hotel, you'll be sent to another, the one specifically designated by the health authorities for this purpose), by decision of the competent health authorities:a) For patients with COVID-19 and those infected with SARS-CoV-2;b) For citizens for whom the health authority or other health professionals have determined active surveillance.it's on Visit Madeira and it's 14 days and you have to test negative twice to be considered recovered. http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/useful-info/corona-virus-(covid-19)/information-to-visitors-(covid-19)"
"paw63 - I agree it would be interesting to know what happens. Do men in long black coats (wearing face masks, naturally) come and drag you off to some isolated hotel?But in reality, I believe there have been very few people that have had a positive test. There were two reported just recently, from mainland Portugal, but it's not an every-day occurrence."
"Do men in long black coats (wearing face masks, naturally) come and drag you off to some isolated hotel? Not on black, on white PPE equipment and can also be women...There are almost daily positive cases at arrival, majority are locals returning (or family visiting) so they will stay at their residences, but some do go to the designated hotel."
"I believe it was mentioned on another post that if you tested positive you were sent to another hotel , then after 7 Days tested again and if was negative then you are allowed to go on your way to wherever. The poster HADN'T tested negative but was sharing what she believed to be correct . I've read up on this the now , not exactly crystal clear really. Before anyone jumps in , I know all too well it's a difficult situation to manage. As original poster said be interesting to hear from a ""Real Life"" case , though for the life of me I wouldn't want my worst enemy to catch Covid ."
"People who travel to Madeira are asked to fill a health questionaire where they include their email and phone number. In case one is tested positive, authorithies will use those contacts to establish communication with the ones involved and the required steps that need to be taken. This could be as simple as saying they will send a means of transport to pick you up where you are accomodated at time X to send you to hotel Y, your room number is Z, you will be provided with meals at times A,B,C, etc. This is all based upon the assumption you don't need hospitalization. If you do, you will be taken to hospital for assistance.That person will now be followed by the health authorithy and medical team. Based on a number of aspects, the authorithies may decide to test you after 7 days, or it may only test you after 14 days. If you have some sort of symptoms after 7 days, for sure you will not be tested and you will need to be kept isolated. If you don't have any symptoms after the 7th day you will probably get a test. All based on medical decisions.Edited: 5:37 am, August 21, 2020 "
"Alex S this is based on what has happened with a few cases that have tested positive in the last few weeks. I believe the 7 day test criteria is not stated officially as a standard procedure because, as I said, that will depend on a few factors which are analyzed by the health authorithy. Some people could simply read it as a standard procedure and request the test after 7 days which will not be happening in all cases."
Cheers for that fnc_paulo
"Either way, there is a good chance that you will have missed your flight home by the tome you are 'released' and will have to purchase a new flight home.Could be expensive."
"Yes may well end up quite an expense HO101.......my master plan to check Hotels policy prior to arrival regarding refund of nights NOT stayed in hotel , I assume you get a refund , which in turn would pay flight home . That sounds too simple though.Accommodation and meals in COVID hotel picked up by authorities but website says your flight home to be paid by Your insurance company. I’m sure they will be chuffed at that .Edited: 7:15 am, August 21, 2020 "
I was told on the island last week that the hotel used for those testing positive is in Santa Cruz near the airport. I also know of one person who send just one night in the hotel waiting for test result (pre 1 July) who said the hotel was great and he was fed and watered for 24 hours at the cost of the government
"When it all kicked off, those testing positive were isolated at the un-used Quinta do Lord resort near Canical.Then they started to use a number of hotels - including the big one on the sea front at Santa Cruz, one on Machico and a couple of others I think.Decent hotel, but no way to spend a holiday."
Two more positive cases reported today and another 3 under investigation.One of the positives is from the UK.Both are young men.Currently there are 23 people in the quarantine hotel.
"H0101 : If you travel with TUI you get free Covid cover, which pays all medical expenses and includes a new return flight if required:https:/…our-promiseSo not as expensive as you might expect."
"That's a very good offer from Tui, David.Other operators - take note.(I wonder what happens if they stop flying to your locations, due to new Covid restrictions?)Edited: 9:32 am, August 22, 2020 "
But not until beginning of Noveber as they are not flying or doing any package deals to Madeira until then.Come November that offer might not be there.Who knowsRob
"It does say between now and the end of the year, Rob.I think they might start up again before November now that Madeira has been added to the quarantine-free list."

If you are tested positive are you allowed to fly home before the 14 days are up
"I’d think definitely NO , I’m sure I read your return flight cost has to be covered by your insurance. Think I read on Madeirasafe.com , not 100% sure tho ."
Hazel from our visit my understanding is only if you later test negative. Authorities/medics would make those decisions about when you are retested etc based on your case.
What would happen if you were travelling as a family and one of your children tested positive? Surely they would not be expected to go to the quarantine hotel on their own and a parent could go - imagine the trauma
"Nay787 as you might imagine children are not separated from their parents in any circunstances. I think there is a general misconception of what quarantine is. Quarantine is not abandoning or punishing for being infected. At least not in Madeira. Not even couples are separated. In fact if you are travelling and live with someone that is infected you are considered a close contact by authorithies so you need to self isolate as well and probably be tested later on.Edited: 8:14 am, August 27, 2020 "
"oh yes that makes sense, we have cancelled our holiday until next year but was just thinking as we have young children.Edited: 8:21 am, August 27, 2020 "
