"I would appreciate if TripAdvisor could add a filter for ""no pets allowed"" on hotel searches. I refuse to stay in a hotel that allows pets, and it would save lots of time to search with this filter addition. Thank you!"
"The information about any hotel listed on here is submitted by the hotel itself or any ordinary TripAdvisor member can submit details of a listing. TripAdvisor don't go out and visit and research each hotel to gather information about whether they allow pets or not. I'm not sure how accurate any ""pets"" or ""no pets"" info is on here.I don't like dogs, so I would like to know if the owner has dogs running all around the guesthouse, or whether guests will be bringing smelly dogs. I usually find that information on the official website of the guesthouse itself. I browse TripAdvisor listings and reviews pages, but I don't 100% rely on the accuracy of the description info on that page. I double check."
"It's a difficult search filter. As a parent with a child who has a severe allergy to dog and cat dander (hair, faeces, urine, saliva, all airborne) it's difficult to choose somewhere just because it says no pets allowed (we used to end up after a day in A+E until I started to question everyone involved). We find many don't allow you to bring pets as they have a small petting zoo of their own! We went to stay in a holiday let in Buckfastleigh, Devon. The owners said no pets, we checked and still no pets. After my family booked for us all to have a family gathering I called only to find out the own lives next door with her dog that's allowed free reign including on changeover days. She said the dog isn't sent into the cottage on purpose unless it's to chase out the cat!There needs to be a more obvious filter i.e NO PETS ENVIRONMENT or PET ALLERGY FRIENDLYAt the moment, I do the search and then put in the pet friendly filter, write down all that allow pets and then one by one contact the others to check. It takes weeks to find somewhere, it's usually the luxury end but worth every penny!"
Even a no pets allowed policy will not guarantee that there will not be animals. Service animals are allowed to go anywhere their owners are allowed to go. It is against the law to refuse them.
"That's a very fair point, lobomago. I think that there can also be a difference between no visiting pets and ther ebeing no pets at a property. In the end, as is usaully the case, the best thing to do is to contact the accommodation and ask for some detailed information."
Is there a chain that doesn't allow pets?
"Welcome to the forums, Shelly.I am sure there are more, but the one I am aware of, is Marriott Courtyards. The other Marriotts (Residence Inn, Ritz-Carlton, etc.) do permit pets, but not the Courtyards. However, some pets are tiny enough to put in a purse, and sneak in, so, even though they are not permitted, they might be guests. Just recently, I saw a sign at a Palm Springs Courtyard about a $250 fine if pets are brought into a room."
"Shelley, as another poster has said, a no pets rule won't necessarily mean no animals as there may be service animals there or the owners may have pets."
Thank you!
"Service animal is a big con job, a way to circumvent the law to con people into thinking you can't go anywhere without your pet., It is another extreme of life in America. It's not much different that continued use of your disability parking sticker after your hip is healed. The only service animals i can see are those that are used for the blind. Not sure how this con got started, another law that many flagrantly use to their advantage. I am staying at a place in Siesta key Fla and I feel as if I am at the humane society there are so many dogs here. I will not come back and have been coming her for over 15 years, each year it gets worse. Keep your dogs at home or don't get one."
"I am currently staying at a resort in Siesta key Fla. Actually it feels like I am visiting a humane society convention. The number of dogs at this place is off the charts and each year getting worse, I will not come back again after 15 straight years or more. It's another excess of America. pet owners must think its cute to have rufus tag along on vacation., Rufus has to urinate somewhere and do his business and dog owners are not often discreet . In addition, the service animal tag put on these animals is another con for most people. When did we become so dependent upon an animal helping us get through the day. Guide dogs for the blind use to be the the only animals that received a special consideration which is as it should be. Even airlines are now looking at the motives people people bringing their pets on airlines. It's not much different than getting your special sticker for parking when disabled and not turning it back once your better . I see many people using disabled stickers that seem quite able to walk an addition 20 steps. Americans seems to feel there are due some special privilege ."
"Agree!!!. I have bad allergies and find searching for ""no pets"" brings up the opposite in all searches everywhere! It is very frustrating and time consuming to find a hotel that wont make me sick!"
Yes!!!! Good idea!
I find it amazing that some properties are now going rather over the top to attract people with small dogssecretsresorts.com/en_us/offers/small-dogs-w…
"I see more and more of these tiny dogs being carried around in purses, and sometimes, snuck into fancy hotels. At least, this way, they don’t have to be snuck in, inside a duffle bag."
"Eh, I'm of two minds on dogs. Dogs have been following their people over hill and dale ever since we domesticated them, and I think we in the western world went way overboard in banning them from everywhere in the latter 20th century. However, now certain people seem to be swinging back the other direction - they can't be parted from Fifi for more than 10 minutes. There has to be reasonable middle somewhere."

"smushie, there are trained and certified service animals, and there are emotional support animals. While some ES animals are also trained and used responsibly, many are not. You can get ES animal stuff over the internet with basically no certification at all - and many people do that, just so they can take their pets everywhere. IMO that ruins it for everyone who truly needs the help.Edited: 1 year ago "
Maybe it depends on where you live? I see a ridiculous number of badly-behaved little dogs wearing official-looking vests. :-(

"Hi everyone,Thanks to you all.Ive actually met others who similar to me.I have allergies to dogs and cats and find it extremely difficult to get a hotel, that doesn't allow pets, some say they don't until you turn up..I'm absolutely fed up of this.If you say something then your cast as a ""Dog Haters"" not fair.I have a few businesses and travel a lot.Even if me and my wife pop up to The Lake district, its impossible.So i'm taking a bold step to stick up for us!!!!Im going to have a ravel website built which ONLY deals with accommodation that DO NOT ALLOW PETS.Anyone with me?I live in North Yorkshire, England,"
"I love dogs let me make that clear and have had two or three over our lives but believe there's a place and a hotel room is not one of those places especially if used by non-dog owners. Unless hotels can keep rooms ONLY for dog owners so that every other guest doesn't have to put up with beds that dogs have been on and rugs full of hair (and with the best will in the world, not every hair will be removed). But how do you prove that a dog hasn't been in the room? Wait until you're taken to the emergency room while heaving with an asthma attack or covered in a allergen reactive rash?It's about time dog owners realised that their dog might be the love of their life, but isn't that of others.Since the National Trust have started to allow dogs, we've unsubscribed and I know many others who've done the same. Not because we're ""dog haters"" - an easy argument to throw at anyone - but because we'd like a day out not surrounded by the smell. Why take a dog to a National Trust property? Is it going to be interested in the history of the place?We have friends who insist on taking their dog everywhere - including dog-friendly restaurants - yet before they had their dog, used to complain about being near them while eating out. When we go to one of these places, we're often seated near the door - at one restaurant we were squeezed in at a table in the stone flagged reception area with people coming and going, door opening to the freezing air. As we'd already booked and paid ahead we just ate and left.One restaurant meal was absolutely ruined half way through eating due to someone arriving with a dog that suffered serious halitosis made worse by this untrained dog straining at it's leash. We didn't stay for our planned puddings.We stayed at one hotel which was SO dog friendly the smell was overwhelming. Fortunately, we only had one night booked and by the time we'd arrived after a long journey, it was too late to find anywhere else. We didn't even have breakfast but chose to leave beforehand.I think soon there will be a backlash as many hotels will have to refurbish their rooms more often as, in order to open their doors to pet owners, they may not have taken into account ""little accidents"".Edited: 1 year ago "

"Amberfox47 in post #25At the risk of a painful pun, you shouldn’t “ Run with the hare and also hunt with the hounds”, as your review of the Old Boathouse, published today, says that you visited the place with your friends and their dog, so it seems you are happy to inflict dogs on people when it suits you and your friends..We’ve been NT Members for years, and have visited 20 of their properties this year alone.The NT have allowed dogs onto their properties for many years, with some restrictions about access to formal gardens, parkland, the interior of the property, etc, and we have never had the slightest problem with them in any place we’ve been to, nor have we ever smelt dog breath or pee either."
"I can't see any other way of doing things than to allow business to decide for themselves whether to welcome dogs or not. Provided the policy is made clear, then people can make their own choice as to whether to patronise businesses according to their own views and beliefs."
"I agree! My brother is severely allergic to dogs and cannot stay in a room where a dog has been if he wants to continue to breathe. I'm not kidding. I've been trying to help him book a room in London and all three of the hotels I've contacted thus far allow dogs--not even dog-free floors or rooms. I am not allergic but since we couldn't have dogs as I grew up, don't care to be in a room with dog fur or the smell. Personal preference, but a STRONG one."
Leave them home please!

True but I find this an unfair policy. People who use service dogs or assistance dogs are protected by the equality act (UK) and may take there dogs where they go. But...What about people like me who are severely allergic to dogs and can't breath when in the same area or an area a dog has been in. And I will end up in the A&E/ER because of it. Surely this classifies a disability and should be protected by the same equality act or should I have to sleep in my car in the hotel car park as I have done in the past.
"Camper..Welcome to Tripadvisor today..Presumably you manage, in your day to day life, to avoid anywhere and everywhere that might have been recently frequented or visited by dogs, and thus have avoid ending up in A&E/ER, so my best advice would be for you to write reviews of all the places you have stayed and visited where you didn’t have to sleep in your car, for the benefit of other members who also have such an apparently acute and severe allergic reaction to the ( previous) presence of dogs somewhere...RegardsMondialEdited: 1 year ago "
"I have a caravan. Cos you can't trust hotels.I get so frustrated with people's attitude towards this allergy cos if someone was allergic to seafood and a prawn came out in the salad by accident at a restaurant there would be uproar.I understand seafood allergy is deadly my friend suffers but I have also been unable to breath and rushed to hospital from a hotel all because it wasn't pet free as described. The hotel owners attitude was ""well I cleaned the room before you arrived. I thought that would be fine""."
Happy caravaning to you....Seems you don’t need to worry about dogs in hotels now..RegardsMondial.
No but I am trying to rent an RV in America to tour but out of 12 companies so far not one can provide a pet free one. So my holiday of a lifetime that I have spent years saving for might not happen.

"I have been looking for the same thing. No pets allowed. No matter how I word the request, I keep getting results for pet friendly places. I have even told a hotel I have pet allergies and was put in a room where the previous guest was a smelly dog. We were moved pretty quickly."
Working Dogs for the Blind or Disabled are trained dogs. The huge majority of people's pets are not trained. I would never want to stay in a Hotel room where animals have been kept. Hotel cleaners neither have the time nor the equipment to sterilise a room satisfactorily. If I wanted to sleep where animals are - I would book into a zoo.
"If certain Hotels are forced to accept animals in their Hotels, it is because the Hotel does not attract enough clients to be profitable . This is perhaps because the Hotel is lacking in standards in some way."
I take it you do not like animals then Marvin !!!

"agree totally smushie - no hotel room is ever sterile especially the door handles, light switches and other small bits and bobs. I completely ""get"" issues for people with skin allergies but those with extreme conditions would not risk themselves by staying in standard hotels anyway. People with other allergies are just at risk (if not more) if they suffer from food allergies. We have a family member with a nut allergy and I am constantly amazed at the general ignorance amongst the general public (including staff in food outlets and bars) of the life threatening issues for those with food allergies of coming into contact accidentally with the allergen that they need to avoid which if introduced to them can trigger immediate anaphylactic shock (and possible death in the worst case scenario).Going back to the issue of pets , we have never taken our (hairy) dog to a hotel ,but after booking into a Travel Lodge overnight on our way to stay with friends to go to a funeral, I noticed that for an additional fee we could have brought him with us and left him at the friends home whilst going to the funeral rather than paying arranging kennel fees) - it hadn't occurred to me that chains like that allowed dogs etc to stay. The fee was £20 per pet per stay for up to 2 domestic pets (not to be left unattended in the room at any time) - the charge being to cover the extra cleaning required to remove pet hair etc from furnishingsEdited: 1 year ago "
"I know that our dog is much better behaved than many children I have seen in hotels and other places Smushie . Allowing their little darlings to run riot seems to be an increasingly common thing amongst young parents these days . In contrast our dog is welcome everywhere he goes because he knows his place - that he is a dog, he does exactly what humans tell him to ."
I would also like to know if a hotel is a no-dogs hotel.. I dislike dogs in dining rooms and also do not agree with dogs being left on their own in hotel bedrooms whining. There should be filters on all booking sites for non pet friendly hotels.

"Wow, what a thread. I've just read through it all. We stay in hotels with our dog every now and then. At least in Finland not every hotel allows pets... there have been many nice little independent hotels we would've been interested in but had to pass.Allergies are one thing but please note that not all dogs are some whining, barking, mayhem on four legs. Ours has been house trained since the age of 9 weeks and doesn't have ""accidents"" nor does he make noise in the room."
"I am highly allergic to cats and dogs and have allergy induced asthma. Respiratory issues fall under ADA rights; however, the travel industry appears to careless about people with ADA respiratory needs in order to get additional dollars for pet charges. We have to write our legislators to advocate for laws to protect our public health and safety first and uphold ADA respiratory rights. I am sure once a lawsuit is filed they may start thinking about the health and safety of people before profits."
"I am currently searching Brookings, Oregon and have found that there appears to be NO hotel there that has a 'no pets' policy. I have done a lot of research and spent a lot of time looking at property websites and have become quite discouraged since I have allergies to an extreme extent. Though I have been to 'no pets' hotels that have had 'service animals', and it does seem that some people abuse that, (more recently than in the past), I still think a search for 'no pets' can be a useful tool as much as the 'pet friendly' tool. You'd still have to check the individual property, but it could help with filtering the queries with much less time spent. As for my Brookings dilemma, if anyone knows of a nice property along the ocean that doesn't accept pets, I'd like to know about it. Meanwhile, I am checking rentals that charge quite a bit more but say 'no pets'.(Yes, I know how owners can take their pets in the properties when cleaning, as one person commented below)."

"I travel often for business, and I going to the doctor for a second time in 4 months with bug bites (not bed bugs) likely ticks from a recent hotel stay. Friends stayed in a hotel between closing on old/new home, and their pets caught fleas (they never had them before). Hotels are not taking the proper procedures between guests with pets to ensure the rooms are insect free. (We know how quickly they turn those rooms around - and time is money.) When I search for non pet friendly or pet free hotels, I get lists of the best pet-friendly hotels. I have to find a way to stay in at least pet free rooms. I can't keep getting bitten and/or have my allergies flare. BTW, I stay at Marriott and Hyatt exclusively."
"I also have allergies to cats and dogs and it is becoming harder to find hotels that are not pet friendly, as if everyone wants to live in a zoo. Its funny that I can't have a peanut on a plane but people can bring their allergen carrying pets everywhere. One thing I do if I can't find a hotel that does not say pet friendly (even though we know of the people that con with service animals) is call the hotel first and tell them you have allergies, they will most likely tell you more specifically of the pet policy.. I do not know if some hotels still have the hypoallergenic rooms but even if they take pets, some only allow them on the lower floors so they can disturb each other and you can get a higher floor.

"Dogs are gross...love them, but not inside. Those of you complaining about sanitization...humans, for the most part, have self control not to lick the remote, rub their behind on the carpet, pee on the floor, and we (humans) take showers daily.I do not have any allergies towards animals, but have to lie and say I do so hotels will try and accommodate my need for cleanliness (crazy that I prefer not to have to sleep in a bed that an animal has slept in). It stinks looking for hotels anymore because I have to call and ask them, ""Are you a pet-friendly hotel?"" A filter is needed pronto. If they have one for pet-friendly, they need to have one for no pets allowed except service animals (which does not include ES by the way)."
I agree
"Melissa,Sounds like you have a law suit.Best of luck,Hunt"
"I wish they would post that!! Westin allows pets on their time share owned properties and they don’t designate certain rooms for pets and ones for humans!! Where did the human rights go?? Believe me, they can clean/deodorize the room, but someone with allergies will still have issues! My son did and it was two nights of not so great sleep!! He was coughing bad!!"
"Maybe this is new, or perhaps I am just seeing such, and noticing it for the first time, but more hotels *seem* to be listing “pet friendly,” on their Websites??Hunt"
"I have the same allergies and it got to the point where I feel that Hotels, airports and other public services put dogs and cats before people...where does this insanity stops???"
All sites should have a No Pets button. It's so time-consuming to have to check the policies on every hotel. We aren't talking about service animals (that have enough hotels to go to) or pets that are snuck in. I just want to choose only the hotels that do not allow pets either paid or free. Pet allergy people need to have places to go just the same as people who love traveling with their pet. It isn't fair that they have an option to choose but we don't.
Shela CWelcome to the forums... I think post #1 adequately summed up the difficulties of having a “ No pets allowed” search filter almost exactly 2 years ago..
"Want to add that just because a property doesn’t allow guests to bring pets, it doesn’t mean that the property is animal-free. I have stayed at several (maybe even many) hostels that have a strict no outside pet policy, but the hostel has a hostel dog and/or cat. Obviously the hostel animals aren’t sleeping in the droms/private rooms at night, but if the concern is allergies, then the animals would be all over the common rooms, etc."
"I would like to reiterate the request that a “no-pets” or “no-pets except service animals” be added. I have a severe allergy and must travel to hotels with emergency medication. A filter may not guarantee a completely animal-free hotel, but it narrows down the field of places to call and, in my experience, the managers of no-pets facilities tend to be more knowledgeable about allergies. If a filter also assists those who prefer pets-free hotels for personal reasons, that fact simply demonstrates more traveler interest in the filter. Whether people should or should not travel with pets or which pets should qualify as service animals is a completely separate issue. Pet-friendly is already a common filter."
Fully agree....not everyone wants dogs around or can be sure they were not allowed in unsuitable places or beds !My wife is strongly allergic to dogs and cats....and we need to be assured there are none.
"I have an allergy to cats and dogs and find that more and more hotel/inns are allowing dogs into their rooms. I can understand on the floor in the bar but not in the dining room or in the bedrooms. It is a sad reflection on society to think that hoteliers have dogs on an equal footing to human beings. In fact on a higher footing than humans, as I do not know of any dogs allergic to humans"
"Basically these days if you are allergic to pets you are screwed. Can't travel on airplanes, go to hotels, and now even stores and restaurants are pet - friendly zones. So. For me. I have to be cloistered at home."
The role and status of pets within our society is outside the scope of this forum. I think that the discussion here needs to focus on Tripadvisor and it's features.
As you can see pet allergies have a dire affect on many people who want to use TripAdvisor for health related travel information.
Are you not allergic to service animals?
"Service animals have dander I assume. So. Of course. Allergies are to the dander, not the function of the animal."
Food and cigarette smoke allergies are politically correct and accommodated. Pet allergies are dismissed and denigrated and definitely not accommodated nor even tolerated.
"My point is that it's businesses and owners that decide whether pets are allowed or not. If anyone has an allergy to anything, as I do with some food types, Tripadvisor is not a reliable place to get any information on, and they cannot control what restaurants etc choose to do."
"And my point is that service animals are allowed everywhere by law. So it doesn't really matter if a place disallows pets, you might still find yourself sitting next to a Belgian Malinois."
"Well, I have also just spent HOURS trying to find a pet-free motel because of allergies. I am having no luck at all. There is no correct ""filter"" that will bring up hotels or motels that do not allow pets, or at the VERY LEAST have a few rooms that are pet free. From all the folks searching for this, it seems there is a substantial group of people with this need that is being completely and totally ignored by the motel industry."
"As has been explained, being pet free does not mean service animal free. I don't know what the answer to the problem is. It's beyond Tripadvisor to sort out."
"Agree, we need more hotels with NO pet policy and maybe even NO kids policy. For the record I have kids, but cringe when I see kids or dog in a hotel just figuring I will be paying to hear them both. Arg. I think I would rather stay in a smoking room rather than one that has had pets. When I see a 4-5star hotel on Yelp with photos of dogs on the bed I just can hardly believe it. Do pet owners not know dogs lick their butts? I have had the 4am dog wakeup call too and it feels so wrong to pay for that at a hotel. And to hear people loudly scold their dogs is so irritating as well. Like kids playing video games on airplanes without headphones. Just to know a dog probably pooped on the floor somewhere in the room is enough to really make you NOT want to spend the night there."
"Well said and I couldn't agree more strongly. We've just arrived back from two days in Cornwall. During that time I've been attacked but not bitten by two dogs. Had to play hopscotch to and from the beach, watched dogs pooing as we ate breakfast and see 'responsible owners' pick it up, but not all of it, in a little plastic bag and wrap it tightly then a knot and swing the bag of poo proudly as we retch over our full English breakfast in our unsuspecting 'dog friendly' hotel/Pub/Restaurant. Wet dog smells haunt every meal time as waitresses make their way around beady-eyed, recumbent dogs watching every mouthful as they dribble onto their urine-soaked carpet.Perhaps we can get publish a list from Cornwall County Council whose inspiration it was to allow dogs to infest every establishment in Cornwall with dogs, of all establishments who won't allow dogs. I'm certain I will not be first in the queue and it is my sincere wish that Cornwall County Council spend some time and research to educate more catering staff, especially cooks at their marvellous Camborne Catering College."
Right behind you on all points!
"I have spent days trying to find a hotels in Rome and Paris that DO NOT accept pets. Also NO SMOKING properties. It’s an impossible and frustrating task that’s for sure. There are many people who would prefer a pet free hotel. There are also many people who suffer from allergies and need a clean environment.It would be great if websites could clarify the hotel policies. I understand that service animals would be exempt and perhaps these could be assigned to certain rooms. Hopefully one day PETS ALLOWED and NO PETS ALLOWED will be clearly indicated in all websites, including TripAdvisor.Thank you and Regards."
"The problem is that any third party site might not be accurate or up to date. Even if I set up a new site tomorrow which would be dedicated to listing only completely pet free hotels, where would I get the info from and how would I know that it was correct?Don't get me wrong, I think that such a resource would be useful in trying to present an overview and a start point, but the reality is that one would still need to confirm with the accommodation that the place is suitable for whatever needs you have. And even then they could lie, either deliberately or accidentally.It is a problem, but there is not an easy solution."
Yet many dog owners complain that it's very difficult to find Hotels that accept dogs.
"Indeed, Ray, you are correct. The problem exists in reverse as well. I've seen hotels misdescribe themselves as being dog friendly when they aren't really, not to my definition anyway."
Yes to this!!! Not everyone is Felix and Fido crazy. I don’t want to be in a hotel with barking dogs and meowing cats.
"I know and understand. The point is that TA is riddled with errors and no third party site can ever keep things up to date themselves. They are reliant on information given to them by owners and guests. The potential for errors, either deliberately or accidentally, will always be there with any site that depends on user generated content.I don't object to a filter, but don't expect it to give you brilliant results every time."
"I often find the hotel’s official website does not specify their pet policy. I then go to Trip Advisor who sometimes state Yes or No to pets. To confirm I then email the hotel in question. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every hotel stated their PET POLICY on their official website, as they do with NO SMOKING. etc. This would solve the problem and would not be a headache for TA. More importantly strait forward for the customer."
"I would not rely on TA for any information.I would say TA is the least reliable source of information.The problem with pets is in some countries guide dogs or I think they are called service dogs in the US are allowed by law, so how can you have a complete ban on pets if some dogs are allowed?"
"I understand ‘service’ dogs exempt by law in many countries. Perhaps these guests could be allocated a specific room for this purpose with wooden floors. My ‘beef’ is having to sleep in a room where dogs /cats may well have slept in the bed or on the furniture etc. There are many infections/bacteria/fleas etc. that can be passed on to humans especially babies, children. Not to mention people with allergies. People pay a lot for accommodation and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to choose a NO PETS ALLOWED property and have confidence that is exactly what it is."
The US also has laws against discriminating against those who have disabilities. We try hard to integrate those folks into society not segregate them!!
So. People with anxiety have disabilities. But. People with allergies do not? Definition alert!
So am I to understand that even if you are very allergic to pet dander you cannot travel because you cannot find any places to stay that are safe ?How sad in this day and age!
Surely everyone can be accommodated here. It’s got nothing to do with discrimination.The needs of people who require service animals is catered for. The needs of people who have allergies or want a pet free hotel room is not.
"That is surely something for local legislators? It's local laws on accessibility and discrimination that require service animals to be accepted even if the accommodation wants to be completely pet free.The idea of separate rooms and separate floors being kept aside sounds like a good one, but I have my doubts about that kind of practice being legal under UK laws. And maybe elsewhere, too.Anyway, as I've said, this is beyond the scope of a travel website, especially in a section that is meant to be about how to make the site better :-)"
A separate room is a good idea but not many hotels will want to lose money on a dedicated room just on the change that a person with a guide dog shows up. I have stayed in many places in the UK and abroad and I can't remember ever having a problem with pets. I get hayfever so dogs or cat fur can be an issue for me.
"Sooner or later they will be sued for omeone slipping on animals urine on the floor, the place I stayed for a week had urine all in the hallways, just waiting for an accident to happen. People expect the hotel to babysit their scared animals while they leave for hours, and quietly look the other way as they urinate all over these hotels. The tenants above me left their franticdog for 4 hours while it tore up the room and barked/howled looking for its owners. So this is how you treat your ""family"". Get a kennel."
"NormaredWho do you think will get sued, please, and why did you stay for a week in a place where there was “ urine in all the hallways “?I doubt any hotelier will a” quietly look the other way” whilst guests’ pets pee everywhere...Best regardsEdited: 1 year ago "
I agree i think they should add a no pets allowed filter
They can't by law in many countries.
"We prefer to stay in Marriotts, and some of their brands (Residence Inn, for one) allow pets. Every pet, (both cats and dogs) that we have ever seen in a Hotel has been well behaved, and well taken care of by their owner. We have shared elevators with pets, hallways, stairwells, and outside areas. Not once have we ever seen urine in any hallway, or smelled it anywhere. If it was how you say, why in the world would you stay there for a week?We do not have a pet."
Which country are you talking about #102?
"Good grief, it sounds like a terrible hotel if they are happy to allow guests pets to damage their property!Or could there be a bit of exaggeration and hyperbole going on?At any rate, I still can't see much here that is relevant to TA, the travel website."
People look to Trip Advisor for reviews and information on hotels. So. An accurate filter that directs people with allergies to places who accommodate them is a key piece of information for those travelers.
"The point is that the filter is never going to be accurate. I think that people should top regarding TA as a one stop shop for everything they need for a trip (if they do) because despite what the site might claim, it's anything but.Whenever someone has a special requirement of any sort, I suggest not looking at a third party travel site largely made up of user generated content, but instead, to contact the business directly.It's not perfect, but it's surely better than reliance on a site which is riddled with errors. A site where people post reviews to the wrong business, where they can get confused about details or wrongly remember things, and where businesses sometimes don't even know they are listed, never mind try and keep the information here up to date and correct. I don't see any point at all in looking for such a key piece of information when there's a good chance that the key information won't be accurate."
"""An accurate filter that directs people with allergies to places who accommodate them is a key piece of information for those travelers.""But guide dogs or service dogs I believe they are called in the US are allowed by law in many countries. So they can't ban all dogs. Best to check all the reviews, I often scan the bad reviews as this can quickly show potential issues. TA reviews are not that accurate as there is no check the reviewer has even stayed there."
"I'd be happy to start with a list of hotels which at least SAY they care about accommodating people with allergies to pet dander. Then, travelers can go to the direct source for more accurate information about how they do that."
"We've been sold a very expensive two weeks in Florida via tui who failed to tell us it's a pet friendly hotel (apparently they weren't even aware, it's not stated in tui website, we only found out upon having a look at the hotel upon getting home from travel agents) my daughter has breathing issues which are made much worse by animal dander. We asked tui to find out if we can have a room no pets gave ever stayed in, they said the hotel have said that's fine they have rooms but upon contacting the hotel directly ourselves they've said they accept pets in ALL rooms. Tui are refusing to change our hotel (which also means changing dates as there's nothing in Orlando now for the dates we chose, we booked last week for September this year), apparently if we want to change we have to pay but I don't feel that's right as we paid EXTRA for a nicer hotel and we weren't told about the pets (the other hotel this company owns does not accept pets but they are refusing to change us). So TUI told us we would have a pet free room, hotel told us different. If my daughter was to end up in hospital due to their ineptitude they be responsible. Any opinions on this?"
What has this got to do with Trip Advisor please? It doesn't seem as if you looked at the hotel website to see what their policy regarding pets was before you decided to book via TUI?Edited: 1 year ago 
">>they've said they accept pets in ALL rooms<<I'm afraid this is the sort of stuff you'll find out only by contacting the hotel directly. Not even the hotel websites usually go into the details like this. Some hotels allow pets in some particular rooms only, some hotels have a pet floor meaning they only allow pets in rooms on that floor... etc. I doubt any third party agency will know these particulars."
"Best to check before booking if you have certain conditions. I would check the reviews out for a start, if that does not reveal anything then contact to Hotel directly to make sure."
">>>I'd be happy to start with a list of hotels which at least SAY they care about accommodating people with allergies to pet dander.<<<It seems to me that this wouldn't be any better than a Google search. The post by Annoyed demonstrates what a minefield this area can be, and how little any third party will know about a hotel policy."
Obviously the laws that require service animals to be allowed everywhere do not address the disabilities of people with allergies to dander who are left to stay home or take the risk of suffering or worse. It is discriminatory but the lobby for so-called service animals clearly has won.
"The ‘PC’ brigade pops its head up again. Just as there are ‘pet friendly’ hotels and many exist in this category.So too there should be ‘allergy free’ hotels which include a No Pets Allowed policy. It’s time authorities bodies revisit this issue and implement fairer regulations. Of course this has got nothing to do with TA but in the meantime common sense should prevail - we don’t need all hotels to be ‘pet friendly’. Come on Hotel Associations, do something about it."
Thank you.
"Service animals are a con job? What is wrong with you? Are you confused about service animals vs. the trend of ""support"" animals. Anyway, obviously, you should stay home and I'm sure everyone would be a lot happier to be around dogs than you."

"Dander - free hotels. Or at least floors. Please! Cannot count on any hotelier to tell the truth so cannot stay at hotels without great risk to my health. Even those with so-called pet-free floors, people seem to bring their animals into those rooms as well. Unless you have this disability, you cannot understand the severe health discomfort and real life risk."
Dander is the issue. Not the function of the animal. Service animals have dander. So. Let people have their service animals. Of course. Just not where I sleep.
"I am extremely allergic to dogs and cats. They are my number 1 & 2 top allergies. When I react it triggers asthma and a whole host of other symptoms. My allergist says that the only solution (in my case) is to avoid animals. I cannot stay with family because most have pets and I am forced to resort to hotels. Usually it's the higher end ones as someone already noted in this post. I have encountered the odd hotel that have rooms for people with allergies, however, can't remember which ones now. It would be VERY helpful if there was a filter for these hypo-allergenic hotels. Of course that is only the starting point. For me, follow-up is always required. A hypo-allergenic room is no good if it's in a hotel that allows pets in other rooms. When the cleaning staff start vacuuming it quickly stirs up everything which spreads throughout the building. With a vacation rental I have to ask the history of the property as well and sometimes sticking with a good landlord/property manager helps.The other beef I have is with pets on airplanes, but that's for another post!PS - I love dogs!"
"I feel for you and your situation, breckeni, and I am pleased to see that you realise that a filter would just be a starting point at best. I don't object to a filter, I just feel that too many people would rely on it and not follow up to ensure that the accommodation will really meet their specific needs.In that respect, there's a possibility that the filter could end up being dangerous for some rather than helpful."
"RojBlake. You are correct. Even when I followed up directly with the Delamar Hotel in West Hartford, and they assured me that my room would be dander-free it was not. Then they told me that their records showed that no pets were ever permitted in that room, yet there had clearly been a pet in it and most likely on the bed. The severe reaction I had was obvious.So. Yes. A filter will not make the problem go away for dander allergy sufferers. Hotels are not necessarily honest or maybe people just sneak animals in without their knowledge. It seems nothing will alleviate the problem for people with allergies at this point. Animal-owners have taken over hotels, airplanes & etc."
Me too. Tiresome trying to find such a place
"Recently stayed in the Castle Inn Hotel near Keswick in the lake district. They have pet rooms.However I was unable to find a dog free pub/hotel/cafe/restaurant in the town. the pedestrian only centre is knee deep in dogs pee. Unbelievable. Every door way, lamp post, bollard, bench leg, bit of street furniture is covered in it. (do not stand still for too long). Human beings are secondary. Alergy,?, forget it"
"I agree that there should be a pet free filter. At present, it unfairly differentiates between people with pets and those who wish, or have, to be in an animal free environment.This is a discriminatory bias towards dog owners. I find that trying to find somewhere to stay where I'm not going to be in contact with animals is frustrating and overly time consuming. A filter would reduce the amount of time spent searching for suitable hotels, B&Bs, restaurants etc. I'm very allergic to animals and contact with them triggers a life threatening asthma attack. Even if a property says it's pet free I always double check directly with them. I usually do this via email so that I have proof of whatever they have told me.Allergies and asthma can kill. It's about time these problems were taken seriously. Like other members who have commented here, I too feel like a second class citizen. I'm essentially secondary to dogs."
"HAve you read the comments that try to explain the drawbacks of having a filter? I don't think it is an effective solution to the problem, but I'm not opposed to having it."
Thanks for the heads up!
"Great idea, I would also use a NO pets hotel."
Isn't there a problem with this as Service Animals are to be accommodated in lodging and restauranthttps:/…I can see both sides of the problem and have mentioned it in discussions. Where does accommodating one disabilaty impact on anothers disability?
"#142 - yes, absolutely. That's the first thing I think of when people complain about this and demand a ""no pets"" filter."
"Or a no pets hotel :-)I appreciate that some people have allergies that amount to being a disability. I sympathise with that, but this is a big issue that can't be resolved by a filer or by TA."
There is no going back it seems unless there are NO PETS hotels. But. Then the ADA lobby will object. One disability clearly trumps the other. So. We are left with staying home or staying at glorified kennels now.
There's nothing that Tripadvisor can do. Such problems are way outside the scope of the site.
"Great idea. Allergy sufferers can start our own sites to rate hotels for such things.And. Comment on TripAdvisor to help others.Edited: 6:58 pm, November 18, 2019 "
"The person to requested a filter for hotels who do not allow pets is a great idea. As that person I refuse to stay where animals ""dogs/cats "" are allow to stay as well"
"Will be starting a new site soon for all dander allergy sufferers who want to travel without anxiety or fear of health or breathing risks. Pet-free spas, hotels, air travel. Have amassed an investor group to help counteract the dog lobby. Stay tuned!Edited: 10:16 pm, December 16, 2019 "
"I think it's great that you are doing something. I hope that your information will be up to date and accurate in order to help others.I think there's room for the 'dog lobby' and the 'allergy lobby'. It's just that TA is not the place for either to argue the merits of their respective positions.Edited: 7:35 am, December 17, 2019 "
"Obviously we will continue to comment on experiences at various hotels, restaurants on Trip Advisor so that future customers will know what to expect."
That's great - exactly what reviews are for! I should have been more specific and said that the TA forums are not the place to argue the merits :-)
"If you do get such a site up and running, I would be very interested to hear about it. Like many others, I am very allergic to dogs and cats. Over the past 5-7 years it is harder and harder to travel and fly. Having a 'No Pets' filter would make a big difference. I do the same as the earlier person who ticks on 'pet friendly' lists those places and then excludes manually from the list."
"Recently stayed at the Delamar Hotel in West Hartford CT where they assured us that our room had never had an animal in it. Yet, there was clearly dander in the room, and on the bed. Beware! If they say they ""deep cleaned"" the room, it means there was an animal in it. And ""deep cleaning"" does not get rid of the dander on the bed.Many hotels are not truthful about their so-called pet-free rooms. It is very dangerous for those who have severe pet dander allergies.Solution? Keep reviewing your experiences with hotels which do not truly have pet-free rooms."
Fully agree with you. About time this filter was added. Same with camping websites. There should especially be a filter on restaurants and in fact I cannot understand why dogs aren’t banned from any areas where food is served .
I prefer a NO PET Hotel myself
"There is currently no such thing as a PET FREE hotel. Service, emotional support animals have made hotels into kennels and there are not enough of us to make a hotel fight the ADA. Plus they must be making more money on people who want Fido sleeping on the beds. It's a disaster for those with dander allergies. So. Be mindful when they say PET FREE, there is a chance a pet has slept on the bed anyway."
"There doesn't seem to be a public place anymore where a person can have a meal, or take a trip without being confronted by someone's pet dander, barking, jumping, humping, sniffing your body parts, slobbering and well, much worse. So. As the pet owners constantly tell me, stay home.If you allergic to, fearful of or don't like their pet, you are a hateful horrible human being. That's what it's come to. Soon creating a website to amass our kindred spirits, but afraid most of the $$$$ are with them. So far. Follow the money."
"I guess it comes as a shock and affront to some people that there are in fact animals out there in the general environment. If you have a pet or have been anywhere that has pets then there's a good chance you're carrying things from those pets. The wind is blowing pet-things. The dirt contains pet-things.I am allergic to pretty much everything that grows: if it produces pollen, it makes me itch and sneeze. I don't expect any place to rid itself of flowers in the yard or on the tables, or to insist that patrons, vendors and employees wipe themselves down before entering in an effort to keep pollen out. I just take my antihistamines and move on with my day.Edited: 4:47 pm, January 02, 2020 "
Clearly you don't have severe allergies to dander which are not alleviated by taking anithistamines (which are not healthy to take every day anyway).
"No one is complaining about animals or pets in the ""general environment"" but in airplanes, hotel rooms and restaurants where proximity can trigger asthma, throat closing, breathing impairment and risk of anaphylaxis.Sneezing and itching is just an everyday thing, This is quite different."
I am totally with you! I have had a heck of a time finding luxury hotels that only allow people ( or certified service dogs only)
I normally request a no-pet room since my husband has cat allergies. I assume (maybe I am naive and wrong on this) that first floor rooms are generally given to pets. I would think that there are enough people with allergies that hotels would keep some rooms pet-free.
As someone who suffers from a severe pet allergy I couldn’t agree more with your comments. It’s a shame that all directories and hotel information does not include this information. Like yourselves we have found that it’s the top end hotels tend to be totally pet free and also we have now taken to going on cruise to avoid contact with dogs.
"I am the opposite, i refuse to give money to hotels that dont allow pets. So yes, this would be very helpful."
Really excellent idea. People let their pets behave atrociously.
I am allergic to dogs and cats also among other things but have 2 and allergy shots have taken care of that issue. Most of the high end hotels I have been at allow pets and I am happy for that thigh I generally don’t travel with mine. One of the finest hotels in the world actually has two house cats that you see often.
Seriously? Shots and you are fine? Wow. It must be a miracle. So happy you love the owner of the best hotel's cats. Not everybody will.
It is ridiculous that people can't go on a once in a lifetime trip to somewhere like Venice without leaving Bowser behind. A dog doesn't care where he is. He's just as happy in the backyard with a stick than standing next to the Grand Canal. Leave the dog in a kennel. It's an animal. He's not your child. It's a DOG. It's an animal. He'll be just fine in a kennel and you won't ruin other peoples' magical holiday.
"You sound a bit harsh Ken, but as a former dog owner I do agree with the underlying sentiment. We never took our dog away with us. I think we have to recognise, though, hat to some folks a dog is part of the family, and in some cases the children in a family group might be very upset at leaving the hound behind."
"I agree that a dog is a dog and leave my two at home. They are there to protect my home and my family. I love them dearly but do not wish to inflict my dogs on other people, who have the right to holiday without pets, if they choose. But if we're talking about behaviour, I see more badly behaved children than I do dogs.One answer, get a caravan/motor home, whether you wish to take Fido, Felix and the bloody Budgie or if you wish to be 100% sure it's pet free, it's simple."
"Perhaps harsh. But as a non-dog owner, I've had countless trips ruined by barking dogs, and it's the same at home in the apartment with barking dogs going on for hours. To the owner, it's a member of the family. But to everyone else around you, it's an animal, and nothing more. It's ultmately about respect for others, and there's very little of that around, about thinking of others. If the family has little ones who are going to cry all the time about leaving their pet behind, then those little ones are too young to travel. One reader writes about peoples' rotten kids and what do we do about that, but that's a WHOLE other issue! Take care."
I think I'd rather be bothered by a badly behaved dog or small child than a badly behaved adult. The dog or child is only behaving appropriately for its age or species; the obnoxious drunks and gropers and cussers and smokers and the rest have no such excuse.
RojBlake You clearly want dogs and pets allowed. We get it.
"You clearly don't want pets allowed. We get that as well.And I don't, as it happens. I want there to be some places that choose to allow them and some places that choose not to allow them. I am just as keen for people with allergies to b accommodated as I am those who want to travel with pets. As it goes I'm luckiy that I don't have health issues that make it difficult or impossible to stay in a place which accepts pets, that's why I'm in favour of pet free places.In the end, though, this thread isn't about our personal beliefs, it's about the desirability and practicality of adding a filter.We can all carry on discussing it or we can just give up and accept that it's TA's decision what they do with their site, and that they can't do anything about the wider issues."
"Having severe dander allergies or anxiety around other people's pets isn't a personal belief. So. If hotels could just be clear and honest about their pet policies and ""pet free"" rooms it would really be wonderful.Unfortunately, hotels make more money from pet owners it seems so that's the bottom line."
I completely agree with you that hotels should be much clearer about their policies and enforce those policies properly with consistency.Money is the bottom line in so many case and TA is no exception to that!
"Trip Advisor is supposed to advise travelers with helpful information. ""Pets Allowed Hotels"" or not would seem to be more than helpful information for travelers. Understand that they may not have the financial incentive to do so.In the meantime, best to keep reviewing individual experiences with hotels which are not clear or honest about pets in rooms."
"I fully agree. Silly me. I was hoping there was an actual way to chat to TripAdvisor.Still maybe, if enough people comment. . ?"
What about the people like myself who have severe allergies?!It’s terribleEverywhere I go it’s a pet friendly hotel
"TA can't do anything to alter that. If they introduced filters the information produced would not necessarily be particularly accurate.Even the information in reviews may be incorrect, either due to time passing or maybe because the reviewer is mistaken."
Stop the apologists for hoteliers who have turned their properties into virtual kennels. Keep reviewing bad experiences with hotels which are dishonest about animals in rooms! People's health and welfare are at stake.
"Reviews are good. They will highlight lying hotels who say one hing and yet do another.But that doesn't mean that every review is going to be honest and accurate, so it's not a solution. Most of the hotels that don't care will probably continue not to care."
Keep writing those reviews! We'll take whatever we can get for information to save major health issues.
"Today, on Recent Tucson Reviews, there is a review from somebody, who came to Tucson for a family funeral. They brought their pet with them, not only because the Hotel’s website said “pet friendly”, but, also, because when making the reservation, they confirmed that fact with the hotel over the phone. Well, when they were checking in, the front desk told them that no pets are allowed. Big disconnect somewhere."
Happens both ways. I was told no pets had ever been in the hotel room we stayed in and got very sick from dander. So. Keep those reviews going! Everybody needs accurate information and keep hotels accountable.
"#185,If you want “accurate information,” then TA would be the very last place to look to - they have their agendas, and truth is not one of those.Hunt"
"I agree, but I'm out now. The discussion is just going around in circles.If anyone wants to believe that TA is going to sort this problem out, or that reviews will force hotels to change, then please be my guest and carry on."
Excellent. We will keep writing our TA reviews with any chance it'll make a difference for those who suffer from dander allergies or anxiety around other people's animals.
"I also do not like dogs. Yet I am staying at a hotel that does not allow children but ESA are allowed. Of course, there was no warning ahead of time about dogs, just no children allowed. Dogs allowed but not children!!! I would like to file a complaint about this. Any suggestions??"
It is not just America. I am overseas and staying at a hotel where 2 large dogs are considered emotional support dogs. No children allowed but dogs are.
What hotel? Write a review on TA and all other sites.
I agree we don't have pets because we don't like them. So why would we want to pay good money to stay with them. Most dog owners are selfish and think we must all love them but they are dirty.
#193The dogs or their owners ?
"I was looking on the internet to see if there was a list of any no-pets-allowed hotels for those of us who love and have pets ourselves, but don't want to share other people's pets when we travel. I found this question from two years ago and decided to re-ask in case there was something published. Anyone?Edited: 7:12 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"Please disregard the prior message about requesting information, thank you."
People like you make it hard for people with service animals.The ADA works with the Deptmant of Justice these animals are protected my federal laws.My son isn't blind he has a severe traumatic brain injury due to being hit by a drunk driver why don't you people focus and the laws that are being broken DWI and drugs in your motel room discriminate much there is a place in hell for people like you maybe one day you'll need a service animal
"Lana, I'm sure you have a valid point, and possibly you're very angry, but unfortunately your post is very difficult to understand.It sounds like you're suggesting that people who don't want to stay in hotels that allow animals would think it's acceptable to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Also it seems a little excessive that you think non-animal lovers should end up in hell (which doesn't exist anyway).For the record, I don't have an issue with hotels that allow animals, but I do expect the animals to be well behaved. Mind you, I expect that of humans, too, and am often disappointed."
Allergies are not considered disabilities? Severe breathing reactions are not important to the ADA? Anxiety and fear of animals is not as important as other kinds of anxieties or disabilities?
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hea…Coronavirus carried from humans to dogs. 3/4/20Edited: 8:12 pm, March 04, 2020 "
I agree. They could at least have 10% pet free rooms. My husband has severe allergies and they get angry if you request no-pet room. Sorry but are they going to pay for an ambulance trip and Decadron shot? No!
I too would appreciate this. Pet allergies.
Totally agree. No pets allowed should be a standard filter.
"That would be good. Why people want to sleep with their animals is beyond me. Dogs skid along carpets leaving traces of faeces, urinate, leave fleasAnd now with this Covid-19 could be spreading the virus on their costs/furRevolting. If you’re allergic make sure hotels tell the truth and there really have been no dogs in roomsBetter still “Pets Not Allowed” is a good policy, places can be a forensic experts wet dream anyway Best of luck"

Human coronaviruses are most commonly spread from an infected person through: respiratory droplets; close, prolonged personal contact; and touching an infected area, then touching mouth, nose or eyes before washing hands.""∞∞https:/…How-COVID-19-Spreads""[Heading] How COVID-19 spreads > [Subheading] How does the virus spread.""The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).""∞∞∞Insist on honesty from hotels on their ""No dogs allowed"" policies, but dogs and fleas have nothing to do with COVID-19.Edited: 8:46 pm, May 31, 2020 "
">>>Yes, people lie<<<Yes, even without pets"
Covid or not. Pets are not everyone's cuppa tea and can cause real physical and mental harm and anguish to those who are allergic and fearful. So. Please. Be honest about pet policies. Human lives are at stake.
Post 208 - Who are you asking to be honest? If the wrong information appears on TA it is the fault of the business who hasn’t updated the information. Never rely on the information on a third party web site for something that is important to you. Always contact the business in question.
"Aldergreen in #209 Tablesedge in #208 has been complaining in this forum about this particular issue for over a year now, yet still doesn’t seem to grasp the simple fact that TA can only display the information provided to it by accommodation owners..I would expect anyone with pet allergies, which are so serious as to be life threatening , to check directly with their intended or potential lodgings to check exactly what their pet policies are..TA isn’t, never was, and can’t ever reasonably expected to be, a global policeman for every allergy, ( no matter how serious it may be ) personal preference, whim, dislike, or anything else.."
"Maybe tablesedge has grasped that it's not TA being dishonest but owners and managers of hotels? That's how I read 208 first time around, which is why I didn't answer.I'm probably wrong, though. I haven't had a very good record at guessing things in recent weeks.Edited: 3:30 am, June 09, 2020 "
"Roj - that is why I was asking who was supposed to be honest. I didn’t know if he/she was referring to TA or to the business owners. If it’s owners, the chances that they will read that post is slim to none."
"Yes, I agree with you. My position on this hasn't changed in months, but I gre a litle tired of pointing out that TA can't do anything more than display information from guests and business representatives even if it wanted to.You can have any filter you want, but ultimately it's only as good as the underlying data.My message is don't rely on TA and, yes, accommodation providers can and do lie."
"Never said to rely on TA, just be nice to have a screen to start the process. Of course, you have to go directly to the hotel or restaurant to ask them directly what their policy is. Websites are not always updated. The problem is that many hotel desk people and/or owners are either lying or unaware that animals have stayed in their rooms and on their beds, so asking for a more vigilant caring industry and accurate information. With Covid and everything else, who wants to stay at a hotel or eat in a restaurant now anyway?"
"Also, can read people's experiences who comment on TA about these issues where they've eaten or stayed."
"So basically what tablesedge is saying is that you can’t rely on TA and you can’t rely on the business because many lie anyway. So what’s the point of a filter in the first place if it is so inaccurate?Edited: 1:02 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"That is the flaw in the idea of coming to TA first. I can understand why those who search for accommodation on this site want a one stop shop for everything, but the reality is that the desire can' be fulfilled. That's partly because if you can't rely on what a hotel says or does when you contact them, getting info from a third party is going to be far more difficult.And reviews have to be assessed critically as well. Some reviewers may be in league with the business, some might be competing against it, so again there's no guarantee whatsoever that the info contained in a review is totally accurate.Looking for patterns in reviews will help, but by far the best approach is to contact accommodation providers and ask them questions - rigorous ones if appropriate because your health would be under threat."
Got it. TA is not a place for general first stop travel information and their reviews are not worth reading because they are mostly bogus.
"Tablesedge in #219 Can we therefore reasonably deduce, from your comments, that your 151 reviews are also “ not worth reading because they are mostly bogus” ?It’s a dangerous position,... sitting on a fence, and expecting support from both sides of it..One side has stinging nettles, and the other side of the fence has things you wouldn’t like to step into...."
Sarcasm. Responding to #218.
Tablesedge in #221 I see no sarcasm in RojBlake’s comments in #218..None at all...
My response was sarcastic. Oh boy.
You’re beating a dead horse here. Why not just let it go.
"Bonne chance, hoteliers. Allons-y."
"Yes,I agree ,I dont want to stay either,plus my daughter is very allergic and skin breaks out,thank you"
"Yes,hooray!"
This thread has turned into a right mess. It is now impossible to read. I will ask TA via the Help Centre if they will consider closing it.
