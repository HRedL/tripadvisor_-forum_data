"I have been working on a tiny little surprise for you. No hints until it's ready for the unveiling. I do, however, need your help.Being that people ask some of the craziest questions and often GREAT ones, I need help with a small list of questions, health related.What are your top 10 health/medical concerns about traveling to Cabo? I don't care how insignificant you might think it is...or how obvious (followed with a ""duh""!) it is to you, as it may not be common sense to someone else.Please be patient with the surprise, as I already wear like, 27 different hats so it's taking longer than I thought!THANK YOU!!! "
Before my first trip I wanted to know :Can you drink the water?: Where do I get medical attention if needed?:Do pharmacias carry american medicine?:What is the best remedy for a hangover?:)Well..that's only 4 but # 4 is very important so that counts for 2..:)I LOVE surprises!!!
"Can I drink the water?Should I buy pharmasuticals (SP?) in Mexico?Mosquitos? (I love that one)Montezumas revengeHow hot is it? (another beauty)Do I need to worry about the ice cubes?Sunscreen how much SPF?Are the pools heated?Street Taco vendors, OK to eat?Swimming in the ocean, hows the undertow?My $.02 JenF4B"
"Is the water safe? (course...you could ask that AnywhereUm...I lost my script for (Viagra, antibiotics, vicodin, etc) Can I just walk into a pharmacy and get some? For my buddy, or course.How hot does it get?If people are always drinking bottled H2O, what about the ice in the drinks? Or in the shower!! Should I brush my teeth in Cabo?? Ahhhggg!(This wasn't an actual list the I PERSONALLY would ask, right? Just questions you've seen?)"
"Only one I can think of:""Can I go into Mexico without TwinRX?""Considering you can get Hep anywhere, but god forbid it's all ready to get us in Mexico! Haha"
"If I fall and get hurt, where do I go for help?What kind of medical information (insurance info)do I need to have to get help at the local hospitals?Is there ONE hospital you'd recommend where the doctors understand/speak English fluently?What do you do when you get stung by jellyfish?What medications at the pharmacia should I buy when I get:  Montezuma's Revenge? common cold cough rash sunburnedYour project sounds interesting and I can hardly wait to see what you are creating!"
"Thank you all for the starter questions! Give me some time (meaning a few weeks) and all will be revealed. It'll be cheesy but hey, that's me!For this Q&A, I can tell you that I am doing an official interview with a doctor (think Trapper's list but for medical stuff). Oh, and for the jelly fish question...pee on yourself. Seriously. You would be surprised at how quickly it can help with the pain. Same goes for certain bites. (I will have an official answer on that along with my surprise, as really it does depend on the jelly fish.)Please keep the Q's coming! P.S. Yes you can walk into a pharmacy and buy Viagra for your ""friend"". ;-)"
"You asked :)1) If I purchase an Emergency Locator System and activate it in Baja; How long will it take emergency responders to find me?2) What is the cost of medical evacuation from Cabo San Lucas to San Diego? Should I buy the insurance?3) How long on average will I last before I get Montezuma's Revenge?4) Is there a vaccine for Dengue Fever? Do I need one?5) I like to surf. Is there a shark repellant product available in Mexico so I don't get my limbs nibbled on?6) Scorpions, Centipedes and Jelly Fish stings; What can I do?7) If I need hospitalization, which ones do I go to and which ones should I avoid & why?8) When I purchase the extra insurance for a rental car or ATV excursion, does that include medical?9) Should I wear a respirator in dusty desert areas?10) Can I trust the pharmacy drugs if they are being imported from China?Thanks for asking :)"
"Oh wow - where to begin. A couple years ago I didn't really have any questions and thought things would just work out. Now my questions are:1. Which hospital is the best for a serious illness like pneumonia or a heart attack?2. How would I go about finding an American doctor?3. What are the procedures to follow if someone dies in Cabo?4. Are there translators available, because even english speaking hospital staff don't understand everything I'm trying to say. And I can't always understand them.5. Which is the best insurance for a med-evac situation?Here is what I learned when Dave got sick in Cabo.1. The cardiologist in Cabo was very pompous. And his diagnosis was totally wrong. It made a serious situation very scary.2. We had med-evac insurance through our health insurance, but we had to pay up front in Cabo. We paid the hospital $6,000, the ground ambulance $1,000 and the air ambulance $24,000. That's a total of $31,000 and it took 9 months to be reimbursed.3. We were so thankful we had a cell phone that worked in Cabo and could call our doctors at home.4. Always carry your actual prescription bottles with you. Not just a list. "
"Sounds like a great idea! I don't have many concerns as we have traveled to Mexico for 20 years. The only ones I can think of are already mentioned.. For me it's Montezuma hanging over my head. 3 trips ago found out having a black & hairy tongue was directly related to taking large amounts of Pepto Bismol.... looked really disgusting! Have had to visit the Dentist though while in PV, difficult to find one that was fluent in Enlish. Other questions that I have wondered were about fish/shellfish in particular - buying from vendors on the beach and hoping it was fresh and had been properly iced.This will be great as we have friends that are soooo paranoid, they will not eat off site..and are missing out on a lot of great dining."
"Not sure I like your name cuz we are going there Sat. But I don't care, just take me away!!!Here goes,1. Shrinkage (hear the water is really cold)2. Belly Button Lint (are Mexican fibres toxic?)3. Toe Jam (is Mexian toe jam seedless, if so it should be called ""toe jelly"")4. Jock Itch (is it legal to scratch yourself in pubic, sorry, I mean public?)5. Canuck's Crack (that's what happens to Canadian skin when it goes from frostbite to sunburn city)6. Hockey Withdrawl (do any T.V. channels carry the Leaf games?)7. Razor Burn (should I change blades before shaving my back?)8. Ear Wax (can I use it on my bikinni line?)9. Willnots ( will I get down there and not want to come home?)10. Eye Sore (are there any Europeans sunbathing nude?)"
I do appologize for my previous post. I'm just killing time til my first visit to Cabo!! CAN'T WAIT!!!!
"Yes! please answer why it is ""I -hate-tesoro?""You are there 24/7---so what's the deal?"
"snowkitty99,In '93 I was a big Maple Leaf fan. I loved Doug Gilour and Ken Baumgartner. Go Leafs! ***getawaynow,Google the resort in question, and it'll tell our story. It has nothing to do with the ""hotel""."
"Snowkitty......I just loved it.....!!!!Don't ever apologize for having a sense of humor on this Forum......:)Most of us really enjoy a giggle....:)As for medical ""concerns""....I take with me all the ""junk"" I normally have at home...meds wise....But what worked for me was...""break an arm""...? Lots of tequila.....and an early flight home..:(That part was a bummer.... "
"hey I-Hate-Tesoro, last Sat. they retired Doug Gilmors Jersy in Toronto. My daughter and I are big fans and cried our eyes out. I will check out how you got your name. Thanks"
Thank you dalababe for the kind words!
"Jen, a ""Trapper's List"" for medical facilities, ect. is a great idea!I like NewGrama's list. I would also like to know where to find them and their phone numbers. Thank you very much for working on this. - Dave28 hats now?"
"I'm fairly sure I didn't see anyone ask, ""Can I eat the salads"". Sounds like a fun thing you are doing! Can't wait to see it!"
1. The fear of hospitalization 2. Montezumas revenge (got it in Rivera Maya several years ago-sooo sick!!)3. Bed bugs - I am in the apartment management industry and have had to deal with this dreadful epidemic 
"Well, I have ""grave"" concerns about the spread of ""STD"" in Cabo San Lucas. In Particular as I hear, from a TA Member known as DGUS. ;) "
"What medication do I ask for regarding severe ear ache. I actually had to do this once in Cabo, flying kills my ears. I just can't remember the name, but it worked great! Even doing the scuba ""blow"" during the flight does not help."
Lets see! How about; 1: Does my health insurance cover me in Cabo? 2: How much is it to see the doctor at my resort? 3: Can I bring back meds that cost less in Cobo back home? 4: Do I need a blood test to get married in Cabo? 5: Can I get a Cabo Dr. to write me a prescription for me? 6: If a shark bites me can I keep the tooth? 7: Is there a restriction on the amount and type of meds I can bring back home? 8: Can a prescription written by my Dr. be filled in Cabo? 9: Is it true that the ice from ice machines with holes in it is safe and crushed ice is not? 10: Is it true that a bottle of Clase Azul and a girl by the name of Juanita is good for medicinal purposes? :p Dr. Juan Megal Sanchez 
Sharkey:)STD:..doesn't that stand forSharkslayer Transmitted Diseases??:)Don't blame dgus for your transmissions...IHT...PLEASE use some of Snowkitty's suggestions..in your final list...LOL!!You guys just crack me up!!!!
Sitting here in the land of ice and snow...I think I'm suffering from P.M.S.......(Pack My Suitcase) come on April.....Ken........
What a good idea. Seeing as we have traveled to Cabo since the late'80's I can't think of any questions. Newgramma- does have a good list of questions and being older these days I would have to say that her list would also be mine. 
Oh! I have an actual question that I forgot about! Where is the closest Hyperbaric Chamber in Cabo?
"So Jennifer, what's the surprize? :pLarry"
"I pulled this from NewGrama's list...We had med-evac insurance through our health insurance, but we had to pay up front in Cabo. We paid the hospital $6,000, the ground ambulance $1,000 and the air ambulance $24,000. That's a total of $31,000How does a person pay the upfront medical costs when the cost of the care is in the mucho thousands? "
Beach Fever - I can tell you what we did. We put it on 3 credit cards. 
Are the tacos really made of dog meat?
"Great idea. Here are my questions:1. Is there any danger of malaria if you leave the city?2. Is the fruit safe to eat that the vendors sell on the street? Or is the water they use to wash the fruit with safe? What about the lime wedges that are served with your cervezas?3. What is the protocol if you get sick at a resort and need to be taken to a hospital? (I had an incident 2 yrs ago where I know now that something was put in one of my drinks. My husband went back up to the room and I was laying in the sun. I began to feel numb and couldn't move. He came back down and saw the shape I was in and wanted me to go to the hospital--I refused. I managed to walk back up to the room, but I was out for the rest of the night)Good luck with the project! Look forward to it."
