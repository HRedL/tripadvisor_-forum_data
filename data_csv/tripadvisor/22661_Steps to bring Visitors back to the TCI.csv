"We just cancelled our third international trip, and cannot wait to return to the TCI. As much as we'd love to go tomorrow, we want the Islanders to be as safe and protected as possible, and support the Government's decision to keep the borders closed.A lot of the Regular Posters on this Forum own condos, villas, businesses, etc. They should know... Have any of the Resorts instituted a Special Assessment to cover the additional costs that will be necessary to keep everyone safe? The Resorts should be planning and collecting supplies now. Many people have standing reservations and/or credits/vouchers, and many others will be afraid to travel internationally for a while, so raising prices isn't going to work. Resorts and Businesses on all of the Islands are going to have to invest significant resources to ensure to guests that their businesses and properties are safe.We have given this a lot of thought and think Resorts, Businesses, Restaurants and the Government should do all of the following: 1) Encourage Social Distancing -- keep guests/patrons at least 6 feet apart from others whenever possible2) Move all loungers and chairs into the direct sun between uses and wipe them down with lysol or similar between uses3) Visitors should handle their own luggage at the airport, into and out of cabs and in to their rental units4) Resorts, Restaurants, Taxis should provide lysol or similar cleaning products in all rental units and in all locations so customers can wipe down chairs, handles, surfaces, etc themselves5) Restaurants should use disposable plates, glasses, napkins and utensils. This will cause a lot of waste (economic and environmental), but a $2.00 fee can be added to each entree to cover some of the purchase and disposal costs6) Resorts and all businesses should institute contactless payments wherever possible7) Resorts and all businesses should request that customers use their own pens OR provide brand new pens anytime something needs to be signed OR should disinfect pens with lysol or similar after each use8) Resorts should encourage minimal use of housekeeping. Towel exchanges should be made every 3rd day, at most. Almost all units have washers and dryers -- Resorts/Owners should ensure that there is enough detergent and other cleaning supplies 9) Mask use should be encouraged inside (in Airport, grocery store, etc.). Everyone should have a mask since airlines are requiring them10) Resorts should provide lysol wipes or similar for any shared resource bicycles, tennis rackets, etc11) The government should Eliminate/Postpone high density events like the Fish Fry12) Contactless thermometers should be used to take temperatures at the airport and before entering restaurants. If temperature is spiked, deny entry/quarantine -- as appropriate -- and lodging details need to be shared and someone needs to follow-up.If anyone else has thoughts or suggestions, please add to the list. If the above actions are taken, we think that people will slowly return. With 90 to 100 degree temperatures, and the beach as the draw, asking tourists to wear masks outdoors is not practical. And, yes, having to wear masks and needing to self-clean is no one's perfect, but we should all be used to it in our everyday lives by the time the island opens up and people may want to help the island economically and may be ready for a change of scenery.Stay and Travel safe! ;-)"

"So true, removed previous my post as per usual, I had a typo.! Thank you for your post."
How would you eat at a restaurant if you have to wear a mask? Will they even be open to sit down and eat?
Very well out thought suggestions. We canceled both of our trips this year but are excitedly waiting for our 3 tris planned next year.
"None of that sounds like a vacation to me.We will just stick to our villa when we rent and head over in September, for me having already had it I see others as the issue and will be happy to self isolate at the pool or on the BeachMasks when your shopping and in public spaces is completelyReasonable, eating out will have to change though eating outside is preferred as long as tables are well spread outAnyone with a cough needs to hide away, would you want to eat with the table behind you coughing?Some good points but with various countries ignoring the guidelines it may be longer than we want before borders open"
"Until the high season arrives I am guessing travel numbers will be way down which would solve much of the ""distancing"" on beaches & dining. Getting all of the suggested supplies to TCI might be more of an issue. Hopefully the fresh air & sunshine do their part. Be safe."
"Yeah, that doesn’t sound like a vacation to me. If I were to go, which I am not, I’d stay at a smaller place and quarantine on the beach. I wouldn’t stay in a villa there, the virus would be the least of my concerns, rather, I’d be worried about being taken out by the gang running around killing people they rob. I would have thought that activity would cool off, but I see a 77 year old man was shot to death during another robbery."
"#3 Many restaurants on Provo have outdoor seating. Obviously not an equivalent amount of seats, but enough that I believe spacing patrons indoors far away from each other and utilizing outdoor spaces, could work, short term.We also wonder if the Government might make an exception and let a place like Le Bouchon extend their tables in the evening further down the sidewalk then they typically do. Maybe Restaurants will want to add a few potted palms and convert their parking lots to table space? It obviously wouldn't be the best ambiance, but eating on paper/plastic plates would kill the mood anyway. These are just suggestions to help the Island get back to business. Vacationing, anywhere, in the near term, won't be what it was, but if we adjust to a new normal we can support the businesses and people and place that we all love."
I don't understand the recommendation for plastic utensils and plates. Soap and water kills the virus. Why wouldn't restaurants use their china and utensils?
"Still no response why disposable plates, cups and utensils are necessary? Plus an extra charge? Why? There is no scientific explanation for such a recommendation. If anything, it's extremely wasteful and anti-environmental."
I am also pro environment Lisa. I very rarely use paper plates or plastic utensils. I don't even like that they use paper bags for groceries as I am pro tree.
"Lisa: Thank you for your responses. You truly make sense and yes, am a Trump supporter. This guy has been they hell. Whoever the a president is, goes through all the negativity, etc. o.k., not about America. Per the guidelines, about T&C. I am sooo happy the Calvary (UK Military) has been brought in to help with the upticking of crime on the island for the past two years. People on this forum did not, so pay attention, did not like what I exposed so ... guess we all need to tread lightly. However, the truth shall set one free. Some on this forum who own, are not transparent, did not want it exposed because of the economical value. Crime is crime.Everything I have said today is o.k. according to the guidelines.

"Ok, Vacay. So how come nobody else questions Dagney's Rules for Proper Living? In my little town, we have a Clam Bar right on the water by the bridge. You can get burgers, lobster rolls, clams on the half shell and steamers. Now I Iove steamers. Last summer, they raised the price to $25 for a serving of steamers. Not a huge serving, either. I brought my friend there for her birthday. And they served everything on paper plates. Plastic cups. Plastic utensils. The bill for 2 with 1 glass of wine each and tip came to $90! I went home and looked up the menu at Rothman's steak house and found I could have gotten the exact same meal for the same price, but with china, glassware and real utensils. Okay, so we wouldn't sit next to the boatyard. Big deal. I won't go back to the Clam Bar. Big rip off (even if you get to watch Billy Joel crash his boat into the sandbar .. lol) But I certainly don't want to go away on vacation and use paper plates unless it is someplace like the Conch Shack."
"Lisa: I have three restaurant stops while shopping for years, . Morell’s, Italian place three doors down and Rothmans. Always worked mid-town. Understand what you are saying. Lately, been shopping downtown; a change."
Ben Bensons was my weekly place. Went to the closing. .
"Lisa: The disposable plates and silverware. Not about anything else but restaurant saving some $$ because they have to cut their seating 50%. They save $$ on staff costs. Do not like but this maybe the way of the world. Personally did not grow up with plastic utensils or plates. Who dines this way for $150-200? Things might change. Sad, no one getting an automatic extra tip serving me pasta, steak, etc., with plastic.Edited: 3:38 pm, May 05, 2020 "

off2GCM: which post are you referring to? Please give the name or number.
"Re: #18 Yes, there was a thread on this forum last year about the plastic bag ban:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14739…Of course I am aware, but last year flights were arriving/departing, there were no curfews, stores and restaurants were open and people weren't getting sick and dying from a novel virus. The point is that the Island has to adapt to a new normal to survive. In many US towns, grocery stores will no longer allow you to bring your own bag and they are not charging the legally-mandated bag fee for plastic or paper. This situation is unprecedented.#9,10,16: While I agree that few would prefer dining with disposable plates and utensils (and the waste is financially and environmentally destructive), disposable is much safer for restaurant staff. This virus is spread through the air and through person to person contact. A plate doesn't go from a table to a dishwasher or sink. It is touched by many hands and comes in contact with numerous surfaces. A disposable plate and disposable utensils ensures that one waiter/busboy with gloves can take potentially contaminated items from a table to the trash -- minimizing the risk of contagion. Many people infected with Covid19 are asymptomatic (I will provide a link with an example below). Anyone who is trying to fit a 2019 vacation mentality into a post-Covid world, in the short term, is in for a rude awakening. Turks is a small island nation with limited resources... the priority needs to be the health, safety and well-being of their resident population.[ A US food processing plant found almost 400 employees/nearly 20% were CoronaVirus positive and asymptomatic https:/…index.html ]"
"Yeah, I'm not buying the ""less employees have to touch the plates/glasses/utensils"" thought process. A bus boy with gloves clears the table into a tub that gets scraped and loaded into a dishwasher which sterilizes everything. The food is still going to have to be plated by the chef and delivered to the table by the waiter. I did see a hysterical video on Facebook of a waitress practicing tossing food to tables from 6' away, stuff landing upside down and falling on the floor. Had to watch it a few times, was so funny."
"Dagney, totally agree with you.Times have changed and the new “new” who knows what that will bring.Travelling etc has totally changed now.Personally for us, no travelling in 2020."
Test at airport or negative certificate?Where's Ray? I suggested this weeks ago and was met by hysteria from Ray in NJ how it was mathematically impossible. Or improbable. Or I don't know what. Read:https://news.yahoo.com/bahamas-haiti-want-ne…
"Re: #24ALTHOUGH - we should be very wary of false positives from these tests, and therefore I would prefer tourists have a ""negative certificate"" instead of the airport tests:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…"
"I think a temperature check at the airport could be done or maybe a positive antibody test. As of right now, we need to get our own areas back up and running. I watched a documentary on Netflix about this virus. It is in the lower category for being deadly but that also means that it can infect more people as the majority of people do not die from it and can still walk around to infect other people."
"#26This thread is about steps to bring visitors back to TCI. There are probably millions of people who will test negative for Covid, but also test negative for antibodies. I seriously doubt I have any antibodies as I have been at home since March 6th, But if next November, I test negative for Covid, why should I be prohibited from travelling?"
Lisa I don't think you should.
"#28LOL! You don't think I should travel if I test negative for Covid in November. Do tell, why is that, Vacay? If TCI has no new cases of Covid and every arrival tests negative, what is the problem?"
Lisa re-read your question to me and then re-read my answer.
"#30Vacay, you may think you're being ""cute"" or ""all knowing"", but you are seriously just being obtuse and authoritarian. If I test NEGATIVE for Covid and there are no cases on TCI, then there is absolutely no reason why there needsto be ANY social distancing or masks or plastic plates anywhere on the islands EXCEPT on the plane and in the airport. So other than being disagreeable, give me a scientific reason why international travel should not be allowed with those NEGATIVE certificates? Maybe you want me to get a rabies vaccine, too ... LOL"
"I agreed with you. Your question was, ""Why should I be prohibited from traveling?"" I said, "" I don't think you should"""
"Sadly, reading comprehension isn't a requirement in the TA ""Terms of Use"":-)"
Hahahaha! Oh good - I re-read your earlier reply. Well good then. And I see Ray is awake. What do you have to say about Covid negative certificates to travel? Hmmm?
"RJP: You are too funny. I loved your statements on a client/ tourist taking a private plane to T&C ... good for that family. Now everyone can do but why vilify someone who might want to do? I bet you flew out of Morristown, NJ or Teterboro, NJ when on business. I have. In the end, saved businesses time and $$."
I can’t stand how this forum has lowered again even during a pandemic and no tourism. It could be end of times and there would still be this nonsense. It’s all related. The same MO. One drops off and another pops on. I don’t even want to come on to check updates even for useful things like reports on airlines and getting the “temperatures“ on how fellow regular travelers are feeling...
"**Now everyone can do but why vilify someone who might want to do?**(raising hand) I villified them! Why? Because they were the OP and were worried about whether they would get a full refund or not on their deposit. I'm sorry, but if you can afford to charter a jet to TCI, losing a portion of your deposit really shouldn't be a financial worry - or a worry for anyone else here in TA. Except. Ray. Ray understands those kinds of problems. He's building a business plan .... LOL"
"We were based out of Trenton-Mercer, but did use Morristown on occasion. Never used Teterboro, which is a nightmare given proximity to EWR, LGA, and JFK approaches."
"** on how fellow regular travelers are feeling...**... as opposed to what, IRREGULAR travelers? LOL!"
"#31 and I quote  If I test NEGATIVE for Covid and there are no cases on TCI, then there is absolutely no reason why there needsto be ANY social distancing or masks or plastic plates anywhere on the islands How naive this comment is."
"Just a general note, as of 4/28/20, Trip advisor has reduced their workforce by 900 employees. This has been mentioned throughout the business world."

"SeeMe Travels,A little delayed, my apologies, but your post #36 resonates with me. Specifically your comment, ""The same MO. One drops off and another pops on....."" No need to lose faith in humanity, most of these people you reference with apparent disdain are one in the same - just under different names. (The writing styles are a dead giveaway.....) There is still a wealth of information to be had here once you wade through the nonsensical banter that surfaces far too often. (I actually get quite a kick out of most of it on so many fronts.) So sad that we won't be coming to Provo until next year, we were supposed to leave next Wednesday for a couple of weeks. The lovely Mrs. Noles is in ""depression"" but we feel we are doing the right thing by giving everyone a chance to get past this and on a true road to recovery; both physically and fiscally."
"Re: #25 Worried about False Positive? But... Not At All worried about False Negatives? That's illogical.Re: #26 See above. You could be negative because you were just recently infected -- you'd be sick but asymptomatic with no indications in blood/saliva until a few days later when your immune system kicks in --> by then, you'd already be out mingling with others on the island. Many ""boutique"" hotels do not have full kitchens, so you'd be wining and dining and potentially exposing restaurant staff and other patrons.Re: #40 100% correctRe: #43 this problem is easily solved. 1) hot flashes do not cause significant core temperature spikes in all women. The whole reason you sweat is because your body is trying to maintain its core temperature, 2) for the unlucky whose core temp rises, they can be pulled to the side, similar to extra customs scrutiny, and tested again in 10-15 minutes, 3) hot flashes almost always last 10 minutes or less, 60 seconds to 4-5 minutes is typical, 4) visitors/residents who have been pulled aside can be retested with either a contactless thermometer again, or with a disposable oral thermometer. But, yes, for the protection of all, I believe there is going to have to be health screenings at the airport, And if you have a persistent fever and any other symptoms, you should Not be allowed to freely wander the island.Utilizing Science and Best Practices is the only way this virus can be mitigated and controlled. The days of wishful and ignorant thinking, where ""15 cases... would fall to zero...and the virus would disappear... like a miracle"" are, thankfully, far behind us. We're at approximately 76,400 reported/documented US deaths.RE: #22 the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that medical staff In Their Own Homes consider using disposable plates, cups and silverware. See below:https:/…covid19_home.html""... Consider using disposable plates, cups, and utensils....""Obviously a restaurant is going to have to screen their food preparers, chefs, waiters, etc. The tub that you've referenced is not emptied and disinfected after each use, nor would it be practical to do so. So where would one store those potentially contaminated dishes/silverware and that contaminated tub? Disposable minimizes risk for all. There can be a direct link between clean plate/waiter/patron(s). Waiters could deal only with clean plates and busboys with soiled ones. And the soiled should go right in the trash.As I said earlier, the days of wishful and ignorant thinking should be behind us. Ignorance can literally get you and others killed. N.B. I am reading and posting to learn and share knowledge. I will no longer be responding individually. I wish you all good health and safe travels."
Mynoles1 thank you for your kind words. I usually scroll on by those posts but the saturation on each one just got to me. Sorry you won’t be going this year. I was supposed to leave this Saturday. It’s hard & I’m not counting on any travel this year especially since I’m in a hot spot. I don’t know when I’m getting out of the house never mind travel. Im so thankful it has been contained in TCI so far. Buying time... On an interesting note I was just sent a photo of a huge water spout that was over the east end of long bay today. It was really cool and told it was up there for about 10 minutes. Stay positive! We’ll get back.

Open islands filled with food where customers all touch the same serving utensils and serve themselves, will no longer be viable.

They will also need an even more sophisticated and precise dining schedule to assure social distancing during dining times. Open Buffets cannot be made safe.

You get yourself banned. No one else.
"No bickering needed. No confirmed flights, no vacation/ holiday. Simple. Save your $$."
"In light of the tragic fire at Ports of Call... I suggest:14) Waive (for up to 24 months) import duties and limits on any necessary and helpful supplies that tourists, business owners, returning locals and their families can ship to or carry into the TCI to protect the health and welfare of residents and tourists (I know some supplies are already being excepted). This will further reduce government revenue at a bad time, but it's clear that health and welfare are more important than revenue and this may encourage sharing and cooperation which will keep everyone safer."
"Dagny, it’s the only government revenue—there are no taxes. How do you propose that will work? (No revenue at all?)Can’t get taxes from resorts and restaurants if not open. And what does 1 fire have to do with the whole island waiving duty?Not trying to sound snarky, trying to understand how that would work. Please help explain!Thanks in advance"
"#61 Government has suspended duty for I think another month. They typically do for emergencies like hurricanes. I suspect the Premier will extend the duty free exemption in her address on 1 June. And I agree wholeheartedly with you.#62. With all due respect and at risk of backlash there are a ton of taxes in the TCI. There is a 12% hotel and tourism tax. There are taxes on land transfers, insurance policies, vehicle registrations, bank transfers, etc and while not exactly taxes there are tons of permitting fees and ad valorum fees. Import duty is about 30% maybe 38% of Government revenue if I recall but it's definitely not all of it. Government needs to something other than do nothing. The usual first step is reduce customs duty then squeeze small businesses. It would not surprise me if real estate taxes were enacted in the next two years. Hope not but the Government will be looking for money."
". Data is based on the 2017-2018 TCI Government Budget recurrent revenue of $278,075,799. Customs duties (tariffs) are the primary source of revenue for the government, at 35% of total revenue. This is followed by the tourist-targeted Accommodation Tax, which accounts for 21% of revenue. Customs Import Duties $68,042,411 24.5% Accommodation Tax $59,152,185 21.3% Customs Processing Fee $33,524,768 12.1% Stamp Duty on Land $26,554,353 9.5% Work Permits $23,220,751 8.4% Fuel Tax $8,547,136 3.1% Communications Tax $4,819,891 1.7% Gaming Department $4,496,398 1.6% Vehicle and Driver Licencing $4,418,876 1.6% Telecom Licences $3,420,343 1.2% Seaport Departure Tax $3,132,570 1.1% All Other Revenue $38,746,117 13.9%"

"#64 thanks for looking it up. I'm too lazy to look it up and busy doing something in the real world . Reducing duty is a good way to employ people if investment is there as construction tends to go way up when the Gov't waives duty. I'd love to see Gov't reduce some of their spending even if only symbolically like sharing vehicles instead of trying to have one for every minister on every Island but that's just non resident me. Nah...Never happen.  It's the ""All other revenue"" that scares the beJesus out of me. That category used to be less than about 5%"
"Currently duty tax is on construction items onlyNo accommodations are open to tourists so no accommodation tax coming in for 2 months nowNo one able to sell any real estate during lockdown for more than a monthLockdown no one was suppose to drive around, there goes the fuel taxCustoms closed for 2 months No land sales for a month (remember lockdown?)No work permits renewed, government was closed. Expats kicked out in next 2 weeks that didn’t renew before the lockdownRestaurants were closed more than a month-no tax revenue.

"Have no idea what Richard #66 means. Anyone? #68 posted.Moving on, Blamona, you made plenty of statements. Please tell all of us the exact numbers that are expedited on this post. % per transaction is fine. You were very vague, high level,Thank you."
"Off21GCm: You claim a tourist-targeted accommodation tax is 21%. O.K. Correct. The true tax explanation is 12% tax and then the additional 10% service charge. This equals 21%. The 12% goes to the govt. and the additional 10% is given to the employees per an equation per the resort/ villas. Just being transparent. This 10%, employees are having issues with ... whatever the equation the resort or property mgmt. firm has deemed. Hey, maybe it pays for some of the employees? On a $800/ night accommodation , the 10% service charge is worth $$ to pay for something ($80.00/night). However, not sure which level of employees receive what. Up to the employers and their government. As guests, we just pay.Please remember, average non-mgmt. hospitality wage on Provo is $6.50 - 7.50/ hr.

"Re: #62 I'm sorry that my posts so often confuse you. In #61 I said: ""Waive... import duties and limits on any necessary and helpful supplies that tourists, business owners, returning locals and their families can ship to or carry into the TCI to protect the health and welfare of residents and tourists"" -- nowhere did I say to waive ALL import duties on ALL items leading to ZERO revenue.To clarify, I am talking about things like: hand sanitizer, gloves, disinfecting sprays and wipes, masks, plastic plates/utensils, thermometers, plexiglass, etc, etc. Also #62 Regarding the Fire at Ports of Call -- I think importing rebuilding materials after a fire or natural disaster should also be excepted from duties. The owner/builder already paid duties for the initial build and encouraging the repair of destroyed personal and commercial property should be encouraged. There is precedent for this in US Tax Law. The US Internal Revenue Service often gives a tax credit/deduction to taxpayers who suffer as a result of a natural disaster like a Wildfire, Flood, Hurricane, etc.Belated thank you to the other posters who responded about duties in my absence. Stay and Travel Safe Everyone! :-)"
"Fire at POC—that’s what insurance is forThere’s already a reduction in duty for construction items so they can prepare for hurricane season, so you know. Started during this coronavirus and the premier talked extension very about it. So that part is already happening so you know. And the other monies they collect are tied to tourism and foreigners—business licenses, residency and work permits, accommodation tax and service charges, this is the majority of the revenue, so reducing duty tax on construction items is a bandaid when an operation is required"
"blamona: All businesses to include the restaurant, do they REALLY have insurance? You might not know. Curious.Cagney: US tax code is different than T&C tax code. Not sure what the island govt. does for their business for this type of fire situation.Edited: 7:00 pm, May 31, 2020 "
Does anyone here really care about this stuff ? Enough already. Please.
For posters on this forum: please consider if what you are writing is better suited to facebook. This forum is about providing information to help travellers. Whether businesses have insurance or what the duty for construction material amounts to is TOTALLY irrelevent. Do i give a whotsit if the VAT in France is higher on a glass of beer OR not applied.

"#77, etc, etc: This is the type of short-sighted thinking and mob-mentality antagonism that holds people down. How much off-island money do you and your friends bring in to the TCI? This is a tourist forum. I am a tourist. Myself and people like me bring the cash you so desperately need. I shared suggestions re: protocols and materials that people like me will need to see to feel comfortable traveling to the TCI. You know why? Because if Businesses and the TCI Government try to move forward with ""business as usual"" without these protocols and materials in place, then myself and people like me will not come to the TCI. You know who will come? People who don't take this virus seriously, who think it's ""just like the flu"" and who have not worn masks in their communities or in the airports they travel thru or on the planes that they will fly on to visit. I hope those tourists read my list of suggestions and review the old CoronaVirus / COVID-19 threads on this forum (where people argued it was ""just like the flu"" and ""Nothing to see here... I'm still going... it's not a plague"" ) and act responsibly to protect the Islanders even if they don't ""think"" the precautions are necessary. The Islanders need to be protected.With a limited appetite for international travel (and the current inability to travel internationally, at all) the Island and its business community are going to have to reassure people that the TCI is safe . I am one voice on this forum, but I know that my opinions are shared by many.Stay and Travel Safe!"
"#85 etc... Did you give Baker your list for what you need to hit the Cape & the islands (if you are from MA), post the same list on other TA forums? Or just TCI? I agree with points re; buffets etc but this isn’t original thought re: operational strategies when reopening in this new era. I feel that the post while having some valid points is a bit condescending in its writing. When someone else on island pointed it out, it hit a chord with me as it seems to recur within this TCI travel forum. TCI tourism will be fine in the long run whether you or I decide to return. It’s up to the TCI govt and their SME’s to determine the path forward. Be Well"

"BDT, Stop fooling around and tell us what you really think. A little over the top, got anger? Well we all have. No one likes what's going on in this world. In our little corner we have thousands of deaths and riots in the streets. Leadership has abandoned us. Everyone has been touched by this. We are all living or trying to adjust to the new normal. People are scared. What do you say we cut them some slack."
"#92 - I did not delete the post and I stand by it. Somehow DagnyG can apparently say whatever she wants to on TA and it not get deleted but I merely call her out for patronizing us with her 12 point plan and my voice gets deleted. They also deleted the other posters comments who supported mine in calling her out. Yes. I am American but I am also BOTC so I am a citizen here as well and it is my Government. Now with no evidence whatsoever DagnyG's suggest I would leave my home of 19 years. She is dead wrong. Then she goes on to patronize again about thinking for yourself after she clearly has done so much thinking for us. Apparently also unaware that TCI's are British citizens and can move to England any time they want.For anybody interested in finding out direct from our Premier and our Governor what steps we will be taking tune in to http://www.rtc89fm.com/livestream.htm at 6pm tonight.Edited: 4:22 pm, June 02, 2020 "

"Because the original post is based on opinions, and according to the original poster everyone has a right to opinions, I fully support that Tewks reposted the deleted comment. Dagny if you’re allowed your opinion so should browndogs. To get back to original thread, dagny’s opinions on how TCI should open are her opinions. I trust that the premier has set 4 phases to do it safely, and July 22 will be open to tourists At 6 today you can listen live on the radio, and a recap will be written on the premiers Facebook page. The only opinion to open safely and on time that counts is the premier herselfAll others including the original post and my own opinions are speculations. Travel safe everyone!Edited: 5:58 pm, June 02, 2020 "
I think I am in LOVE with BrownDog! Just saying!
"Re: #97 et al: Like many of you, I love this island and many of the people who call it home. It seems the Premier agrees with me... it is too early to state that July 22nd will definitely be the date that the island opens with no limitations re: quarantines, etc. Health and Safety need to be the most important consideration. We must all -- locals and tourists alike -- work together to keep people healthy and safe.Stay and Travel safe!"
"https:/…As I postedon other threads, nice to bring up one TA deemed closed. Good thing we can now continue to reply. Link above shows 4 phases with dates straight from premiers official page. The only true source with no opinion.Edited: 8:31 pm, June 02, 2020 "
wow weird
And crearlo July 22 full opening with tourists. Directly from official premierCan’t get much clearer than that
