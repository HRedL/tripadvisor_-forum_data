Possibly going in early August... trying to get vibes of how it is :)
We get there Monday. Been a little anxious but all the reports I have seen are that they have it dialed in. I am looking forward to having the place to ourselves though.

"It's choices like yours that are making it so much more difficult for those of us who have the capability to think here in the States .... and if you can't see the validity in that assertion, and what the implications are to those here, then you've progressed much deeper than ignorance.Edited: 10:39 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"World Traveler, why don't you channel that anger and call your local officials to complain about the rioters and protesters spreading the virus instead of people traveling to Mexico. You are a real lunatic."
Fine.Whatever.
We'll talk again in a month or so.
"Man what happened here LOL! World Traveler, I respect your opinion and will not argue with you on this public forum. I have my own opinion and the way Iâ€™m managing and handling this Covid issue. Have a drink my man (or lady) and just chill. And feel free not to respond to this thread anymore. Thanks :)Edited: 10:22 pm, July 01, 2020 "
I am not concerned. I refuse to live in fear. There are hundreds of risks we take on each day. Covid is just one more to navigate. Cheers and enjoy a margarita in mexico.
