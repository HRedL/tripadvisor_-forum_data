Due to recent covid-19 we are trying to call but to no success. Does anyone managed to get through.
"Hi, It took me 2 days to get through. But eventually I did and changed my dates to next year.I was calling from Ireland dialing Irish number provided as well as french number +33160306053"
I've been trying for three days to change booking with no joy.
