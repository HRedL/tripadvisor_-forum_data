HiI understand New Caledonia has a dengue fever epidemic at the moment.Should travelers be concerned we have tickets for May 2013?Thanks
"Hello,Dengue outbreaks are quite regular in New Caledonia especially during summer, but it should not be a major concern for your holidays. Just use repellent to avoid mosquito bites as the disease is transmitted this way (as you would have done to avoid itching).Locals are exposed all year long to government information about how to destroy larvae nests, and the various cities regularly proceed to pesticide spreading, which both contributes to efficiently reducing the threat. Finally, If you manage to get bitten by a dengue transmitting mosquito, the symptoms are similar to flu ones... nothing you'll die of. :)Some more reading: tripadvisor.com/…45823586"
Indeed there is something to worry about. Check out the news (link below) to see that there have been three deaths caused by Dengue recentlyabc.net.au/news/…4653938I would visit a travel health clinic to get expert advice on how to protect yourself and follow it!!Edited: 7 years ago 
"I still say that there is no reason to be more worried about dengue than influenza for instance.In NSW, an average of 1.5 people for 100'000 die of influenza each year. In NZ, it is 400 people each year (for 4M inhabitants). That's not frankly more than 3 people in 7 month for 250'000 inhabitants. And I still don't visit my doctor before visiting Australia or NZ. :)In both cases, death are mostly old people in bad health conditions, or not people not seeing the doctor although they have a very bad fever. Or people not paying attention to this (from the link above):""Also note that you must not take Aspirin if you have the previous symptoms, as it may lead to hemorrhages (but paracetamol and ibuprofene are fine).""Moreover, the difference between flu and dengue is that dengue vectors are mosquitoes, that you can avoid using repellent, whereas flu is a virus (and there is a vaccine for flu, that's true).(figures sources: http://www.fightflu.co.nz/influenza-facts/ and health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/C… )"
"We have just got back from our holiday and once there our host told us it is the early evening mosquitoes that were the main concern, so we took precautions throughout the day as needed, insect repellent occasionally and covered up (mainly from the sun) but if we heard the mosquitoes in the evening we quickly went inside and used the plug in insect repellent things that were supplied. To be honest we only saw two mosquitoes over the whole trip, and we were careful around stagnant water etc.On walking and driving around New Caledonia we can now see where the problem areas could be with regard to living conditions, i.e by rivers and in shanti type accomodation and open drains etc"
"Hi there , I have had Dengue fever trust me you don't ever want it , if ever there were a low time in my life where i literally didnt. care if I lived or died that has to be it, if I contract it again the chance of death is greatly increased. If you go you would be wise to use a repellent 24/7 Trust me this is not your average fluEdited: 7 years ago "
