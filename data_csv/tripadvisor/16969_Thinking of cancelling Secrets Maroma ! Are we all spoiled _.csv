"You know, everyone has to admit that after opening and successfully operating perhaps dozens of top shelf, highly rated resorts with excellent reputations, the temporary situation at Secrets Maroma IS a major miscalculation on the companies part, no doubt about it ! However in a few weeks or short months, everything will be perfect as expected and everyone will completely forget these opening ""gitches / screw-ups"" and everyone will only remember ... "" I think they had some opening hiccups "" !But after reading many posts from people ""who haven't even been there yet"", we're contemplating cancelling our trip tomorrow ! After all, we cannot be expected to lie on ""dark brown lounges"" AND with no cushions, it's unthinkable ! No lobstah, it's barbaric ! ""Anticipating / guessing"" that the pool water isn't quite the right temperature, totally unacceptable ! And then there's music at the pool, how dare they ? That could be the deal breaker of all time ! Beds may be too hard, room service may not be quick enough, charging for drinks of $ 250.00 bottles of specialty liquors, I enjoy a cigar in the evening but we don't smoke cigarettes, and the thought that they actually allow people to smoke ""outdoors"" in the pool area with that ocean breeze blowing in a country that allows smoking, well I might classify that as cruel and unusual ! Not to mention that I'm thinking that the beach cleanup guy's moustache might not be properly trimmed ! Yup, with all of the above suppositions, anticipation and outright speculative speculation from people that haven't been there yet... we just might have to unpack and not go tomorrow ( but maybe not ) ! After all, how much can one be expected to endure from one of the top rated resort companies around that has 1,000's of positive reviews on it's resorts ? Yeah, it has been a screw-up re the opening date, spa not open yet, and yeah it will definitely be forgotten very soon,,, but are we willing to chance it in paradise for 8 days of sun, great food and service just to put up with all of the above possible speculative situations,,,,, especially with the unbelievable special rate we got ( apparantly to compensate for some opening situations ) hmmmm ? Oh my goodness, decisions, decisions ! What to do ! What to do !"
"LOL just spit out my coffee reading that one :)And to think, years ago we booked hotels/resorts/vacations without tripadvisor or the internet? And gasp...we had wonderful trips. "
Stoney: You must have been asleep when I posted my thoughts last night. LoL.
"Hey, does this mean we can't be ""loud"" and have fun at the Swim up Bar?Heck, with Gustav on the way I'm just hoping to get there!And for those of you who can't live without the lobstah...... The shrimp is always better in Mexico.I need a margarita, stat!"
Stoney wake up from that nightmare8 days in Mexico vs New Jersey; come on!!!You will have a wonderful time!
"Matt, I'll be looking forward to your report. Are you planning on posting while you are there? As long as I don't hear that Pina Coladas are a premium I'm good. :-)"
"Well, Stonecreek, all kidding aside, I actually attempted to switch my family (7 of us) to The Grand, but the week in October we are scheduled to go to Maroma the Iberostar website is showing The Grand as SOLD OUT. You see, we absolutely LOVED The Grand and wonder if Maroma is up for the challenge. Truthfully, we booked Maroma at such a great rate it was too good to pass up!So basically we will be at Maroma the second week of October........hopefully to be pleasantly surprised. Having stayed at one of ""the best"", Maroma has alot to live up to!The Grand has spoiled me :( !"
"Xrtek and Lucie, I'm not kidding or having a nightmare.....Let me see now ...MEXICO vs NJNJ Vs MEXICOMEXICO Vs NJNope... still not quite sure yet !But IF we decide to go, of course we'll report from on the ground,,,, IF we still go !"
"Sometimes comparing resorts is like comparing apples and oranges, they are both fruits but taste and appear different.The Grand is one georgous property, huge marble buildings, very glitzy and from most accounts great service and food. I have not stayed there but have stayed at the Iberostars as it was being completed last year.Secrets appears to be a bit lower key, but no less lovely.I have stayed at Capri and loved it for it's down to earth and friendly service as well as the very nice rooms and property.So maybe one will not be better than the other, they will just be different and appeal to different people.We don't all like the same things and we should'nt insist that our tastes are better than others."
"Leave it to another person from NJ to express the situation perfectly. Nice job with the post, that pretty much sums it up. People need to realize, if you book a resort that is just opening, then you risk opening hiccups, period. I'm sure they will be ranking number 1 on tripadvisor by the end of the year and everyone will relax. We're going Oct 11-18th and I can't wait. As far as being spoiled from other resorts, that's not the point of trying someplace new, is it? If there's a problem with this resort when you get there I'm sure they'll make it up to you if you ask. Is any vacation really perfect? It's not home for starters and it's one of the nicest beaches in the world, my guess is that it'll be a good time. It is what you make it, period! Cheers! P.S. Represent NJ! Only the strong survive! LOL"
"Hey Diggy, my bf and I will be there Oct. 11th to the 18th too. I think most if not all of the problems will be solved by then! Can't wait. See you at the bar!"
"Still contemplating.... not sure if we can handle the ""dark brown"" chairs !NJ vs Mexico ....... hmmmm... still not sure !"
"OK, I opened this wondering what would cause someone to not go on vacation. I started reading and soon had my best laugh of the day! Great post. Have a great trip, assuming you decide to go. Keep us all updated on the resort."
Let me help you with your decision.... I will take your place and you can enjoy 7 days in Pittsburgh? Sounds like a deal to me...
"Let's see now,,,,8 days in Pittsburg, NJ or sunny Mexico.... another tough one to decide ! But right now I'm now much more concerned about the cold scented towels and champagne upon arrival, my wife doesn't know if she wants to go through all that ! Still contemplating !"
"Ok Melissa, imagine my chagrin, we are just getting past the brown chairs and cool towels thing and you hit me with Pittsburgh,,, AND I spell it wrong ! Do ya see how difficult a task it is trying to decide ? Now, just imagine, we're presented with the report of a mosquito sighting in a place, in the tropics, on a few humid acres that were just recently carved out of the jungle ! A mosquito,,, in that environment,,,, what do you suppose they'll hit me with next, perhaps BLUE beach towels ? I hate BLUE beach towels !! Blue beach towels could just be the deal breaker !Decisions, argh !!!"
"Man, no one told me about the blue beach towels, they simply won't do!So, ya packed yet?Go have a Margarita and think about your choice!"
Pittsburgh has Black and Fold towels?!?!?
Sorry - I meant Black and GOLD towels. I got so excited about the possibility of you coming to Pittsburgh and me going to Maroma...
"See Melissa, now it's an epidemic of spelling errorzz !"
"Stoney....Have you lost your marbles...ha haYou neen Trip advisor AA (which stands for TripAdvisor that needs ALOT of Alchohol) LOL,and really quick!I'm just worried at this point that we won't even make it in on Sat,With Gustov approaching! Please if you do go....ha ha. Please shout out the weather reports, so we can make a last minute decision if that's what we are up against..... "
Just got a report of some new information from the mosquito ridden resort of blue towels ....Apparently the first guests to arrive on Sunday will be put in charge of the beach detail to brace up the pole with a wind sock on top to check the direction of Gustavs' winds !You just can't make this stuff up !!!!
"The mosquito's were called to tribal counsel and voted Stonecreek out of SMB. He'll be spending the week at Pittsburgh's Holiday Inn Express!!Anywho, hope everyone arrives safely and has a great time. See you at the swin up next Tuesday."
"Ok, the boss says Pittsburgh is out, I just printed our boarding passes so I guess we're going to take our chances down there ! We've resolved ourselves to the fact that the chairs are brown and we'll have to take a deep breath and try to put up with the towel siuation.... But for the life of me I still don't know how we're possibly going to cope with the pool temerature and the music !"
OMGThank goodness you came aroundI was getting worried about your state of mind
"Stonecreek,There's a lobstah loose, arm yourself with cocktail forks and melted butter!Safe travels, look forward to meeting next week."
"No lobstah's Queenie, I believe we've established that they're forbidden fruit at SMB ! Sleepytime now, early wake-up !"
"Hey Stonecreek,Wake up.... ;)I thought you were going in December? Did you change or going twice?"
"Yes oh smudgemeister, we are going twice, today and December 3rd thru 12th ! Didn't want to miss seeing you in December !"
"Well were heading to the airport in a few minutes, very early, still dark.Hope we've made the right decision !We'll try to make the best of it ! Whatever we find !Will report from on the ground on the brown beach chairs, blue towels, music, etc ! Hope we can cope !"
"PS: Just learned of another possible landmine,,,, topless women ! Another decision,,, we'll talk about it in the car !!!!"
"Stoney, you're going twice bro??? Now I'm really concerned about you. I sure that you're going to have major issues dealing with Paradise twice in a span of only a couple of months. Feel free to contact me if you need to be talked off the ledge. :)"
"Diggy, I am from sjersey. We will be there from the 15-22. I agree nj vs. mexico. Let me think!!!. But Oct is my favorite month in nj. Eagles are have a buy that weekend so dh is thrilled. Meet you at he pool:)"
"Stoney, To think that I almost made the same mistake as you. This is just barbaric. Especially those blue beach towels that you can take a many as you want and not have to turn in your towel card. Then there’s no lobstah, I was able to get lobstah at that other resort after making a reservation two days in advance for dinner and having them check my wrist band. What is wrong with SNB? I just checked with my travel agent and they think that there's an extra charge for topless sunbathing. I think we’re going to cancel and maybe do a week in Atlantic City the first week in September. Are you able to recommend a nice resort on the boardwalk with a beach in the top 1000? (No dig on Jersey) Thanks"
"StoneCreek - I just got back from SMB and absolutely loved every second of it. There are plenty of floats for the pool, the water is the perfect temperature, the beds are not too hard, the service was quick, there IS music at the pool. The air conditioning worked everywhere, the shows were good, they serve top-shelf liquor for no extra charge. I can't say one negative thing... "
"My husband and I are at SWB now reporting to you from the business center/we brought our laptop, but have no wi-fi service in our room, we've asked the concierge, and he says we should have connection, but no luck as of today. The pool chaise lounges are actually pretty comfortable, and yes the water is pretty warm, warmer than I prefer for such hot weather. Make sure and get to the pool before noon, because most of the chairs have been claimed by then. We have a swim up suite and I really like itits not very private, considering the pool is shared by about 8 rooms. Speaking of privacy, the bathroom isn't very private-I mean, we asked if they could put up the curtain that divides the bedroom and the bathroom *it's a curtain that hangs on one side of the jacuzzi tub. ANyway, they were happy to do that. I mean, I don't know about any of you but some things are private to me, like using the restroom...We arrived yesterday at 1230pm and were told that our room would be ready by 230, we didn't actually get into our room until 400. The air conditioning works great in the room, it actually shuts off when you open the door. One thing we were upset about is that we were wanting to do some shopping in Cancun for the day, and they no longer have a shuttle that will take you there. A cabride to Cancun is $60.00 round trip, so your best bet would be to find another couple to go in on it with you. Over all the resort is very nice, and in a month or so they should have all of the bugs worked out. We would consider returning in the fiture. The service is great. "
 Are they saying anything at all about the weather situation?
"Personally I hope people settle for the Secrets Maroma Beach in lieu of the Grand Paraiso, it will help keep the prices down. I will say to all honeymooners you would be better off booking the Grand at this point in time. Secrets has a 72 hour cancellation policy, so if you get to Mexico and try to switch to another hotel other than secrets you are stuck with rack rates.I stayed at the Grand last year right after it opened and everything was running well and all the buildings snd lsndscape were completed. We went to the secrets maroma beach this year. I cannot tell you how dissapointing it was. I beleive even when it is completed it will not touch the grand. If you like a stark plain contemporary atmosphere, it is perfect for you. I prefer a lush tropical feel.One last note, do not use Cheap Carribean when booking vacations. Toni at Cheap Carribean is very unhelpful and unfriendly. Next year we will use Apple or Fun Jet. Good luck"
"while I have only booked through cheapcarrebbean once, It was almost half the cost for the package I picked than apple vacations and funjet, plus I got WAY better flights. while I dont know about how helpful this guy is, thats why you should do as much research as possible before so you do not have to count on anyone else for your plans. granted things come up I understand. but I would rather do my research and save a thousand or two thousand dollars. just my opinionty"
