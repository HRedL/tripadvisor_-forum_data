"Heading out on Jan23 for El Coz...... will be travelling with another couple, in total we will have 2-13yr old girls, a 10 yr old girl and 12yr old boy. Anyone else going with children of like ages????"
no one with kids???????
"We just got back from this resort. Was our third time there and we will not return. My advice would be to make sure you get a room in the tower--not one of the older rooms. Plus, be careful of what you eat as many people got sick while we were there (including 3 out of 4 of us). Do not drink the water or eat the ice and be sure to brush your teeth with bottled water. Leave the maid a tip and she will give you extra bottles of water. Be sure to go to the other side of the island and eat at Coconuts."
"As a travel agent I sell many hotels in Cozumel. The El Cozumeleno has many repeat clients year to year because of the great service, cleanliness and close proximitey to the town. I am not too sure what you may have been ill from, but I don't think it was the water or ice as I also just returned from two weeks of drinking the restaurant and bar water and ice as it is my drink of choice and in the past ten years it has never made me ill. As far as the food making you sick, my guess would be maybe the food you ate off resort in a place that does not have a huge turnover as opposed to the resort food......or maybe it was too much sun, food and drinks which is usually the culprit as your system is not used to so much overload in one week.Before you trash a establisment, you should be very sure of what you are talking about., as you may be taking someones means of feeding their family away with reducing the people who may visit there because of your comments."
There's always kids at this resort & plenty of activities to keep them entertained.
You are right so forgive me for trashing the place. The people & service at el cozumeleno were good. But it wasn't the drinks and/or sun that made numerous people sick duing our stay. Not just at this hotel but others as well. They must have received a bad shipment of some food while we were on the island. But we did love it in Cozumel. Its beautiful there!
i just received a call from travel agent to cancel our visit to el cozumeleno on sunday jan. 2. we were told the hotel was cancelling everyone due to health and safety reason. we have been moved to the occidental grand. we could have cancelled with a full refund as well but chose the transfer. anyone know the reason ?
"I'm not too sure, I have clients there starting tomorrow for a month and clients there on the 7th for a week and I haven't heard anything from the tour operator about cancellations."
"yeah. i found it kind of strange. i asked the reason and all i was told was that there was safety or health concerns and that was it. we did not have a choice on whether to go or not. we have been excited about this place because a friend has been there 9 times now. we visited them there last month while in playa to see the hotel. it looks to be just what we would enjoy. oh well, if you do hear anything i appreciate you letting me know. thanks...."
we were told that we were being cancelled by sunquest. ?????
"All I know is that we just returned from that hotel and there was a bad sickness outbreak that began on Dec. 28. It was the talk of the hotel as the majority of the people there got sick. It was only a 24 hour sickness but it was the sickest I've ever been in my life...and no, it wasn't because of the drinks because we didn't drink anything except coffee, juice & cokes while there."
"If it is true that there is an ""epidemic"" at the hotel, then they are correct in sending guests elsewhere so they can fix the problem.I have never stayed at the Grand but would not object to being sent there."
When they moved you to the Occidental did it cost more for you as I found that resort to be a lot higher in price. Just curious
no. either take move or get full refund.money was not mentioned.
My clients left as scheduled for El Cozumeleno ......no issues to report. I'm wondering if Sunquest didn't have any availability at that hotel as they just started there a few weeks ago. Westjet and Air Canada Vacations is still selling this hotel and did not transfer any of their passengers.
Pig flu part 2? ; )
thanks for your input. that is what i was wondering about. we booked back in sept.(group of 8 family members) and really wanted this resort because of location to town and the fabulous snorkeling out front. i will be pissed if it is just because of overbooking.!!!!!!!!!!!
"Don't worry, 6 of us were transfered to the Grand last year from another property - because of overbooking. All of us would go back in a heartbeat - snorkelled right off the beach. Nice quiet resort. Sandy beach, really close to Columbia reef. Great food, no problem getting into alacartes. Large clean rooms. Top shelf liquor. One of our best trips - Enjoy!"
thanks very much. i appreciate the reassurance. sounds nice.Edited: 9 years ago
