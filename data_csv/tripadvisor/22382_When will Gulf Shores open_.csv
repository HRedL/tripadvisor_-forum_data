What’s the timeline looking like for things to start getting back to normal in Gulf Shores and Orange Beach area? I’m ready for a vacation.
Watch here for updateshttps:/…COVID-19-Coronavirus
The beach just re-opened. They are still advising to stay home and to limit unnecessary travel though. Restaurants are still take-out only. Can't say every condo has restricted access but most I've seen do with amenities like pools and gyms closed.
We have booked for the end of May and are so ready to get our toes in the sand and enjoy some Doc's gumbo!
You think everything will be opened up by the end of May?
"Robert C. has given you some wonderful advice.At this time, we do not know when restaurants and attractions will open. They are closed per the Governor's order until May 15th at least. Be sure to check back for more information as we receive it."
"""Open""...Sort of..not normal, not the same. I think attractions may still be closed, restaurants at x%,beach open, grocery stores open."
Having to cancel our family vacation to Hawaii :( This is an area our family has never adventured to but considering. Mid - late July? Watching for tips and good advice.
"So very sorry you are not traveling to Hawaii. Our area is very quaint with beautiful white powder sand beaches. The biggest tip I can give you is that Mid July is the busiest time of year here. Consider local rental management companies for your lodging such as Brett-Robinson, Young's Sun Coast, Meyer and Reed are all reputable and excellent choices."
Thank you for your response. I booked a beautiful condo at Mustique. All of our kids and grands will be arriving mid July so I sure hope things are opening up by then.
