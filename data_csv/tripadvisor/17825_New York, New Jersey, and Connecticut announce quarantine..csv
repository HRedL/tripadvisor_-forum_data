People coming from states where the rate of transmission is rising will be required to self quarantine for 14 days. Ted Lamont says Mass and RI are cooperating too. Unclear if they are requiring the sameQuarantine.
"Alabama Arkansas South Carolina Texas Florida and a few others above the infection rate will be affected. So if you’re from one of the affected states, don’t plan a trip to NY until your infection rates go down.Edited: 11:46 am, June 24, 2020 "
Arizona also
I couldn’t type fast enough.
Last count 26 states have rising rates. Good for these states...must protect your residents.
"North carolina, Utah and washington also. Its based upon week to week calculations. States can be added or removed from quarantine requirement based on their numbers."
"Does this thing have any “ teeth “ to it?I don’t see a lot of details out there yet, It’s being referred to as a “ travel advisory”. But will there be any literal enforcement? To be honest, I don’t see how there can be."
"""""It’s being referred to as a “ travel advisory”. But will there be any literal enforcement?"" If caught violating quarantine there will be a $2,000 fine for first offense (5k second offense up to $10k per offense) and people will be placed into a mandatory quarantine at their own expense. They will also have port authority records so will be able to determine who recently flew into NYC. In an ideal world people from states where the virus isn't being dealt with properly would at least have the respect not to come to another state and then violate quarantine requirements. Unfortunately we don't live in an ideal world."
"The Governor said something like, as with any law, you can break the law and not get caught. But state police, businesses, etc will be on the lookout. The state health departments will be issuing the details on how it will be implemented and what the requirements are. The governor called it a law. Not a travel advisory."
"going to have to agree with @6 the ""teeth"" here could be very tough...any self reported quarantine implies some willingness to comply and we have seen that to be an issue here in US. I really don't know...sort of like the masks...violations seem to only be noticed by other residents. And the extensive contact tracing that Bloomberg was in charge of...how is that coming? It seems people don't even want to give the medical professionals and leads on contacts (in some cases) so not going to work well. I like this idea but do question any real ""teeth""."
>>>States can be added or removed from quarantine requirement based on their numbers.<<<So a quarantine requirement could be imposed (or dropped?) *after* someone is already here? I foresee lots of confusion and near-impossibility of enforcement; seems more symbolic than anything else.
"Other states have focused on airports and lodging for enforcement. Sure, you won't be able to stop the people driving in on day trips from Ohio or Virginia, but most people aren't going to do that."
"""So a quarantine requirement could be imposed (or dropped?) *after* someone is already here?"" - My guess would be if you arrive and are told you have to self quarantine for two weeks then you are required to self quarantine for two weeks, so what if the case numbers dropped in the state you came from a week after you left it. The numbers were high when you left. In reality I don't see many people being caught in that particular situation, because hopefully most people from the states with quarantine requirements would simply not come into the region to begin with."
"""I also have no clue how this will be enforced. The NYPD isn't going to prioritize stopping cars with FL(as an example) plates. Clerks may ask. Who knows!""Montana used the state police to enforce their 14 day quarantine for out of staters."
"“ because hopefully most people from the states with quarantine requirements would simply not come into the region to begin with.”Let’s hope so. But the people who don’t care ( and there are many!) will just lie.If they fly in and get a rental car...If the hotel clerk asks and the answer is “ we have a second home upstate and have been there for a month, we’re just staying in the city for a couple nights on our way home...”"
"#11 - yes, I suppose hotels would be in a position to enforce, but it’s hard to see them doing it, frankly. Random room checks at odd hours? I don’t see how airports/airlines/Amtrak could possibly enforce, other than by canceling flights and/or refusing to allow someone from a quarantine state to board (remember, people from one state often fly into/out of airports in another). License plates? Maybe, if people drive, but random rental car plates will confound things. (Pretty sure I’ve driven cars with Florida plates that I picked up locally.) Plus, who knows which states people may have driven through or what they did there or who they came in close contact with along the way.If lists are updated weekly, let’s say on Monday, someone arriving on Sunday could fall into a different quarantine bucket than someone arriving a day later - with no discernible difference in their risk. Honestly, the more I think about it, the sillier this seems. More substantively, I believe these kinds of dramatic symbolic announcements distract from the behavioral changes that make a genuine difference in transmission. Stepping off my soapbox now..."
It doesn't seem silly to me at all given what is going on around the country. It sends a message to people from high COVID states that now is not the time to come up here for tourism. I could totally see people from high COVID count states deciding they want to go on vacation and looking at the northeast with the low covid numbers as being particularly attractive to visit. Hopefully this will discourage that.
"These three governors simply want to restrict ones rights, don't kid yourselves, this is about control.https:/…From the above story:""The order does not block people from traveling. But it does make clear that if you've been in a state that meets the guidelines -- like taking a vacation to Florida and then coming home, or visiting New York from Texas on business -- you will have to quarantine for 14 days on arriving.""How are they going to enforce this? The simply answer is, they are not going to be able to. Fear mongering, that's all that's happening here, these governors want this to be front and center, for many reasons."
I can also see Florida residents wanting to escape the heat and see NY as a respite with a controlled situation and cooler weather...Europe off the table this summer...lets to to NY!!
"I wish I could say I was shocked that there were still people in NYC of all places with the attitude of #21.Edited: 1:33 pm, June 24, 2020 "

"I'm glad to see this imposed. How will it be enforced? Well, how about the good old honor system, for one. New York has been through hell. Please just respect this and visit at another time or quarantine the 14 days."
"I believe the Governor is being quoted as saying this is a ""symbolic"" gesture. I would expect enforcement, if any, only in most extreme cases."
"""I am not saying people will do that. But they can and the enforcement will be a hit and miss."" In fairness I think the number of people who are going to come here and violate quarantine and then lie to law enforcement about it are going to be minimal. My guess is that most people will not see coming into the region as being worth the potential risk or worth the hassle of having to self quarantine. Just by having the policy will discourage many visitors with the exception of the few knuckleheads who think the rules just don't apply to them."
"""The other thing is that MANY locals do want visitors to come back."" Pretty sure most don't want people from a place like florida with an extremely high COVID count bringing in the virus and risking the whole city being pushed back into shutdown."
"""I was just speaking to enforcement. If I had a trip planned here for July 4th and REALLY still wanted to come, there are very easy ways around the quarantine."" yea they aren't going to be able to stop people who are really determined."
"There will be a significant number (I am not guesstimating that number) who will simply comply with the advisory. And that alone would help reduce the spread. My parents are planning to drive back from Florida on Sunday, arriving Monday afternoon (hopefully). They miss their kids and grandkids. As soon as the presser was over I called my mom to see if she could get on the road today to miss the requirement. She said no, and was sad. But my parents will comply because they love their kids and grandkids and if there’s a risk of spread, they don’t want to be responsible. Plus, they want others to respect the safeguards. It’s a social contract. Some people will accept the social contract. Some won’t."
"#31 - I agree, it's purely symbolic. And yet with so many pressing challenges (juggling continued public health vigilance with the state's reopening, expanding testing and contact tracing, figuring how to fill gaping budget holes), we're now going to need at least a minimal infrastructure to track and update and communicate the rules and publicize (nationally) the ever-changing quarantine list. It's really not a time for symbolism or tit-for-tat."
"""I believe the Governor is being quoted as saying this is a ""symbolic"" gesture. I would expect enforcement, if any, only in most extreme cases."" He never said it was a symbolic gesture. He was asked if it was and he specifically said it was not a symbolic gesture and that there will be enforcement. https://gothamist.com/news/ny-nj-and-ct-impo…"
"If masks are so effective and a requirement here in the three states announcing the quarantine today, then what's the issue. If a resident of NY, NJ, or CT comes back next week from Florida through one of our airports, is law enforcement going to be notified? I can't see how they can enforce this, fully agree it's more of symbolic gesture. At a minimum, people need to go food shopping. I see this as just another scare tactic, again, if masks are so effective, then why the concern."

"Also, excellent point Springerandy about masks. They are simply NOT too effective (17% to be exact), which is why they are so concerned about these people coming from high risk areas."
"40. “...if masks are so effective, then why the concern.”They need to be worn to be effective at all!They’re even more effective if everyone wears one!!Edited: 2:55 pm, June 24, 2020 "
">>>They are simply NOT too effective (17% to be exact)<<<Mike, in all seriousness, what's your source for that very exact figure - and what exactly is it measuring (protection for the wearer, protection for an unmasked second person, protection for both if both are masked)?Believe it or not, even though our general perspectives are very different, I think we're actually aligned on the idea that announcing state-based quarantines is not a good or effective measure. But in my case - and it seems this is where we differ - it's precisely because I think there are much more effective means/messages to protect public health . . . masks and social distancing and avoiding crowds, especially indoors, being first and foremost."
"While I agree voluntary cooperation is probably the main hope, remember there are lots of potential ways to test the ""stories"" - plane/train tickets, electronic hotel room lock records, credit/debit card activity, license plate & EZ-Pass readers throughout the region, etc.How did Florida handle their order on us? Have they made an example of anyone?"
"For all of the people worried about enforcement:Do you stop at red lights only when a cop is sitting on the street corner? Wear seatbelts? Shop lift?Report your income properly on your tax returns? Do you only obey laws when you think you’ll get caught or do you obey laws for any other reasons, including being a law abiding citizen even if you disagree w the law?Enforcement is a problem for every law. Only a small percentage get caught violating any law. But that doesn’t mean they stop making laws for health and safety. Hopefully, this will either make people aware and increase safety or they will do it out of fear. Either way, if it has the net effect of reducing the spread, it’s a good thing. This reminds me of people who want to negotiate the default provisions of a contract. The answer is always “don’t default”. Hopefully, there are people who just want to be good citizens, regardless of risk of getting caught. To the extent that laws are aspirational, well, I don’t have a problem w that. I personally don’t pick and choose which laws to follow based on risk of getting caught. That’s how I live....except jaywalking. I can’t seem to control myself. 12 step program, maybe."
"More to the point ""effective,"" or not, in exactly what type of situation? When you're an ICU nurse and a patient with COVID vomits into your face? When you're in a bar enjoying a couple of beers and it's so noisy the the person next to you has to lean over and practically yell to be heard? When you're at a convention's crowded cocktail hour and you realize there are some good networking opportunities and you slowly make your way through the crowded room to get up close to the person you most want to talk to and stand there like sardines for 20 minutes describing your latest projects?"
"By the way, three of the earliest clusters in northeast US (though were spread throughout US) have been attributed to the following scenarios where there was a lot if animated, face to face talking going on over a period of time:Drug company corporate conference at Boston hotel50th birthday party in Fairfield CTConvention at NY Hilton on 6th AveThese were all last winter (Jan-early Mar) so assume no masks worn."
"Thank you, Rita. Your post #46 said elegantly what I was thinkingRe: hotel clerks reporting people violating quarantine rules - it has actually happened in other places - Hawaii, Banff, Maine, etc."
In Hawaii I'm surprised people actually make it to the hotel as I have heard they intercept people at the airport and if they can't prove they have a place to stay for 14 days then the state of Hawaii buys them a one way plane ticket home.
"To summarize, the current quarantine states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Washington.For most if not all of these states, travel (for business or pleasure) would require at least one night lodging. The quarantine may discourage this travel, and if so diminish hotel use.With this, hotel investors and managers of more than 140 Manhattan hotels yet-to-reopen may find further challenge to their dates and decisions. In addition, other Manhattan hotels which are open may further consider their current operating plans. Finally, more than 2 dozen new hotels are tentatively scheduled to open between September 2020–December 2021 (subject to change).A mid-year report on Manhattan hotel re-opening activity, and hotels permanently closed this far in 2020, will be provided in early July at:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763…Edited: 3:36 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"I doubt if hotels want to get involved in this. I think a more likely scenario is that confirms go out with warnings about possible quarantine rules in effect in NY, that it is guest responsibility to review those to determine if any apply to guest, to recheck them, and that guest assumes all responsibility for any adverse consequences that may result from non-compliance. Then hotel could do whatever it wanted, depending on who is on quarantine list at time of guest arrival."
"Linda E., here is actual proof from a medical journal for the effectiveness of a cloth mask. It was found that 97% of particles can STILL penetrate a cloth mask. Therefore, they are actually only 3% effective. I gave them the benefit of doubt by saying 17%, but actually only 3%. Here is the source. An actual medical journal experiment (not CNN).https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577"
"Mike, with respect - that article doesn't say what you seem to think it does (it was comparing the efficacy of cloth masks vs. medical masks in a health care setting). I also don't get why you said ""17% to be exact"" in your post and are now saying 17% was a ""benefit of the doubt"" figure (you, like, rounded up?). Most of us who advocate consistent & universal mask wearing when social distancing isn't possible are focused on the protection it gives OTHER people, not the wearer.Edited: 3:49 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"But listen Mikey, you still haven't described the ENVIRONMENT in which that testing was done. Was it while a doc was intubating a patient, was it when the patient threw up in doc's face, or was it while two people were sitting in Starbucks having a cup of coffee. Please give details. All scientific studies do that.I believe recent studies are showing level of exposure (amount of droplets, etc) may affect whether get virus and, if so, seriousness of case, with most serious cases linked to most intense exposure and therefore most intense masks (like N95) may be needed there and not in situations where likely exposure much less.In any event, I see mask as a maybe small assurance that this person may also wash hands after wiping bottom. I see lack of mask as person who doesn't wash hands either.Edited: 3:59 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Here is a study that was actually done this year unlike the previous study, that deals specifically with this pandemic unlike the previous study, and deals with the idea of the public wearing masks and not focusing on what types of facemasks that healthcare workers are wearing unlike the previous study. The result of the study is that face masks work at flattening the curve. I'm not sure why people keep trying to debate this. We have seen it first hand the places where the population largely adopts mask use and socially distance flattens the curve. The places where people refuse to consistently use masks don't flatten the curve and have case counts going up.. https:/…2009637117"

"***Enforcement is a problem for every law. Only a small percentage get caught violating any law. But that doesn’t mean they stop making laws for health and safety. Hopefully, this will either make people aware and increase safety or they will do it out of fear. ***Great observation Risa and I agree, especially the part of ""they will do it out of fear"". That is exactly what these three governors want, people to be fearful. And since so many like posting studies about how effective masks are, then there is no quarantine or travel advisory needed, there is already a law that says that people in NY, NJ, and CT have to wear face masks. Problem solved, just enforce the mask law."
"Red, your study only proves that COVID is transmitted airborne as the dominant route. It has nothing to do with the effectiveness of masks. My study proved that non surgical masks allow 97% of particals to get through. This does NOT matter whether it is the flu, cold, or COVID. This is fact."

"A few interesting observations;Why isn’t California on the list?Looks like quite a few of these named states had the tri states on their “quarantine when entering“ list at some point. Is the governor retaliating? Could it be that New York’s numbers are so low for now because the state is just now reopening and behind all the other states in the phases, which is going to obviously cause spikes?"
"""Could it be that New York’s numbers are so low for now because the state is just now reopening and behind all the other states in the phases, which is going to obviously cause spikes?"" Some of these states opened up prematurely. They never got their numbers down in the first place and they started opening up. Also, in some of these places people aren't social distancing/using face masks. As New York opens up there will be an increase of cases, but they are opening slowly to prevent what is going on in other parts of the country where they keep setting records for daily new cases etc from happening here, so in the end if everything works the way it is supposed to we won't see anything like what is going on in places like Florida, Texas, arizona etc.As for California I think its not on the list based on the formula they are using. California has soo many people that even though they have a lot of cases its a smaller percentage of the overall state population than some of these other places. Still I kinda think they should include california, especially given all the coast to coast flights."
"#56, 61To be fair, there has actually been pressure in the scientific community to retract that study: https:/…pnas_loe_061820_v3.pdfHere is a discussion of their concerns: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/…Basically, since there is no good process for determining—in real time—just how much protection solely wearing a mask offers someone out in public (versus other mitigating factors such as hand washing and physical distancing of 6 feet or more) the authors of the above letter are concerned that the study might be used to erroneously promote the benefits of ONLY wearing masks without also stressing the greater benefit that arises in the public sphere from washing hands with soap and water, as well as maintaining a minimum distance of six feet between individuals.Bottom line is that wearing masks in public may ADD a level of protection BUT that alone is NOT sufficient to stop the COVID-19 virus from spreading! So for those who need, or want, to interact with individuals outside their personal bubble group, washing your hands with soap and water, along with remaining socially distanced, is just as important, if not more, in stopping the spread of Covid; mask wearing provides added benefits as seen in the various countries where this is being done routinely.Edit: The last paragraph of my post is the main message ;-)Edited: 5:47 pm, June 24, 2020 "

A state with an overall low infection rate can have boiling hot spots. Etc. etc.And, of course, the situation is constantly changing. A state can be off the list one day and on it the next. Maybe the quarantine will increase awareness & discourage travel from hot spots, containing the virus's spread. That's what some here have argued and I hope they're right. But it still seems to me that the important message is about continuing to social distance and wear a mask - wherever you're from, wherever you go."
"@66 Thanks. I read through your links. I noticed all the scientists mentioned agree that masks are effective at preventing and slowing the spread of the virus.None of them are suggesting otherwise. Its just a question of the difficulty of evaluating the impact of masks when they were being used in conjunction with other methods to control the spread of the virus. My point was never that masks are the only solution but that they have a impact on reducing the spread of the virus. Obviously people need to socially distance and wash hands etc as well, but none of them are saying masks are ineffective or not sound public policy."

That it will reduce the number of people coming from those hot spots. I don't think anyone here who supports the idea of a self quarantine requirement from high COVID count states thinks that means we don't have to socially distance and wear a mask, because obviously the virus is still here on a lower scale and we need to remain vigilant otherwise it can flare up real fast, which we have seen in place like Beijing and Seoul. Cities where they are very on top of the situation and they had sudden large outbreaks when they opened up too much. Fortunately for them their system flagged those cases and they were able to contact trace to stop the spread. I'm not as optimistic about NYC catching outbreaks in time."

">>>That it will reduce the number of people coming from those hot spots.<<<Except as I also said - not all parts of those states are hot spots, not all hot spots are in those states, and containing movement within and across state lines (which are meaningless to the virus) is nigh on impossible."

"These debates confuse and discourage me. In any given day, we do hundreds of things to take care of our health proactively and prophylactically. We watch our diets, wear sunscreen, exercise, wear seatbelts, sunscreen, take vitamins and probiotics, hell, condom use. Cars are designed with crumple zones and better sight lines. None of those alone prevent cancer. None prevent death from car accidents. None prevent all sexually transmitted disease, They help. They reduce risk. So you have multiple sources of protection.. Why is this so hard to understand? And why is it hard to understand that the higher the risk, the more precautions you take? Right now, the result of testing shows NYC is at about 1.2%. Masks should protect most people from casual exposure. If you introduce a population with much higher incidence of the disease, the rate will go up. So you increase your protections. Even an epidemiological idiot like me can understand that. Why keep fighting about it?"
"Risa -It would be a boring world if we all agreed. Regarding the quarantine, your circumstance in NYC is different than my circumstance in upstate NY. I think issuing a blanket quarantine is lazy quite frankly. Regarding masks and social distancing, I agree that both should be done and do both but there was such mixed messaging that like it or not it influenced people's attitudes especially regarding masks. I have seen less social distancing now that people are wearing masks which I do find extremely frustrating.I hope you don't consider this post as fighting; I come in peace :)."
"I have no objections to masks or to be quarantined. I have altered my plans, observed the required restrictionseven when I felt some were more damaging then helpful. I do get a kick out of politicians who attacked others for doing what they now want to do. When New York was the epicenter of Covid-19 in the US and Rhode Island wanted to make sure New Yorkers fleeing to other places would be quarantined in Rhode Island - here was NY response:""I understand the goal ... but there’s a point of absurdity, and I think what Rhode Island did is at that point of absurdity,"" said Cuomo. “We have to keep the ideas and the policies we implement positive rather than reactionary and emotional.”To reiterate, I do think the masks and quarantined make sense be it in Rhode Island or NY."
"Not sure what debate you’re talking about, Risa. Masks? I agree, because at this point I think the evidence is compelling...though not too long ago, I would have disagreed, as would many of us here (maybe even you: did you wear a mask in early March?). The thinking changed pretty quickly.Or are you talking about state-based quarantines? For which, as far as I know, there’s no evidence they are helpful, and plenty of reasons (I’ve tried to articulate some) to be skeptical of them. It’s a new policy and it’s very much open to debate. Maybe i’ll change my mind as things develop. Or maybe you will. I’m just surprised anyone would think it was open and shut at this point. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn’t mean they’re stupid or uncaring."
"# 63I applaud the actions of the governors trying to keep their citizens safe especially in consideration that many governors still believe c-19 is a hoax, their actions indicate such.I do not think the governor's are retaliating but it they are, isn't that good leadership as retaliation has become the thing to do over the past 41 months?"
"1. I was talking about the battling studies about masks. No, I did not wear a mask on March 9, when I first went in to my own quarantine. I couldn't get them but a physician friend sent them to me early on. In the beginning weeks, I did not go out more than once a week, and when I did, I wore a mask.2. I didn't call anyone stupid or uncaring. The very opposite. Do not put words in my mouth. I was trying to do the opposite, that is, expand the thinking that we all do multiple things to take care of ourselves, why not add one more? Stop making this divisive. I didn't disagree with any one person, I didn't call anyone names. 3. Laws are laws. Do you agree with every law you obey? I don't. I do follow them anyhow. I don't know if the quarantines make sense. I don't believe that they were instituted without careful consideration, however. (that is my belief, I don't assume anyone shares my beliefs. But I do postulate that based on knowing a little bit about how things are debated in Albany and hashed out. I know that they don't just do anything without exhaustive analysis. That is personal experience. Do you think it would be better to live in a place where people picked and chose which laws to follow? I don't. 4. When I don't think a law is right, I fight against it. I don't advocate ignoring it. That's just me. But let's be clear and not put words in my mouth. Anyone is free to think what they want. I would plead for civility. And stop putting words into my mouth."
"Ran out of time to edit but wanted to clarify on quarantines/border closings: I do think they can be helpful for isolated areas that are in a position to control entry, like Hawaii, or even Maine (not an island, obviously, but with relatively few points of entry). There’s a cost to it, but it can help control the spread...New Zealand is probably the best example of success at the national level. But these were blanket policies, not targeted at specific states (much less an ever-evolving roster of states). In a state as big and diverse as NY, with as many points of entry as NY has, the situation is very different."
"rjr, I hear you. I hear your message. It's a tough call, trying to find the one size that fits all, but we are one state - having NJ and CT follow the same rules makes sense to me. As I mentioned earlier, my parents are driving home from Florida on Sunday. They have been very well behaved, taking all precautions, ordering food in, or ordering ahead and having food placed in the car, wearing masks, staying socially distant (they're in a nice development where it isn't hard to walk on the walkways and maintain distance). And they want to see their kids. Now they will have to quarantine for 2 weeks. My mom is a bit shaken up about it, but when I said that I would go to NJ and stand on the porch (and I'm sad and tearful), she said no, she will wait. It sucks. But when I hear that my best friend in Boca is warring with her husband because she knows her stepdaughter is partying it up in Miami without social distancing and without a mask, and then wants to come into the house, and my friend doesn't want her to (dumb girl posts her party photos on Instagram), I get why Florida is such a mess."

Text of the Executive Order. https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-205-quar…The Commissioner of Health is charged with issuing the specific protocols and guidelines.
"Risa,I’ve been struggling to find the words to help you feel better: all I could come up with was “Governor Cuomo”. At this point in time, imho, New York City is where it is because of his leadership. He may have made mistakes at first, and struggled to take decisive action early on for various reasons, but he came through in the end. I’m sure that going forward he is acutely aware that this situation is unlike anything any of us have ever seen and he will not hesitate to do what is best to protect the state as well as NYC.As far as feeling confused and discouraged, hang in there and continue to do what feels right for you regardless of what others are saying. It is always better to be proactive, and that is exactly what you have been doing. May your parents have a safe noneventful journey home, and before you know it those 2 weeks will have zoomed by!"
"Thank you for your very kind words, DeltaWing. I appreciate them greatly."

"I understand - it's disappointing if you had travel plans and are now impacted by the quarantine but if it keeps others safer, keep your chin up, don't argue about whether you agree or disagree, want a quarantine, don't want it. It really doesn't help. Let's say things that help us to be upbeat and positive during a most difficult time. This is one summer, not every summer forever. (well, let's hope and pray it's one summer). Our family vacation that we've planned for 5 years was impacted when Maine announced their 14 day quarantine. Many said it would get relaxed but the back and forth, will they, won't they, etc., became too stressful so we postponed our trip to next summer. Instead, we're renting a property locally. The disappointment passes and we're thrilled that we will all still get together as we originally planned. Is it Maine? Nope. Will we be together? Yes. Let's get over ourselves and move forward. We don't have to agree about it but let's at least do our best to BE KIND, be positive and look forward to the time that this dreaded virus is in our rear-view mirrors. We can do this. We all need to be vigilant no matter where we are, no matter where we go. Mask up. We can do this. We must. Stay well."
Sounds good. Enjoy your vacation!
"Travelerfiveseven and others, I hope you all realize that this mandatory quarantine does indeed directly violate the 14th Amendment any way you look at it. Personally, I am amazed no one has said anything on that angle yet. Here are a few lines to educate some of you: ""No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""With that said, I DO understand why NY, NJ, and CT want this mandatory quarantine for US travelers from other states. Furthermore, I do agree that it could prevent future spikes. However, it does scare me that Governors continue to think they are above the law and Constitution. The entire point of the Constitution is to protect our freedoms and liberties and it doesn't say anywhere except if there is a virus. It is a gray area since we never dealt with anything like this in our lifetime, but I do want everyone to remember that freedom did not come free and many of our ancestors had to win wars to maintain our freedom. I just pray that our Government is not using this virus as a tool to slowly take away the freedoms we all have."
"Linda, COVID does not care what setting it is in. It doesn't care whether you are in a health care setting or Supermarket! The fact remains that 97% of droplets can penetrate right through cloth masks. Studies have proved this. Not sure why you cannot comprehend this. Even thousands of health care providers got COVID with proper surgical masks because even THEY are not fool proof."
"Sigh - again with the post removals. I mostly disagree with Mike, but didn’t see anything inappropriate in his removed post. And I mostly agree with DeltaWing, but think this isn’t the place for tributes to individual politicians."
"#105 - setting does matter; the intensity of exposure (not sure if that’s the right term, but hopefully the meaning is clear) is MUCH higher in a health care setting than when two people pass each other in the aisle of a store. Plus, the BMJ study wasn’t designed to (and didn’t) assess the efficacy of universal mask-wearing at slowing the community spread of Covid-19. It was to assess the relative protection that *different kinds of masks* provide to health care workers dealing with unmasked patients with other respiratory diseases. What if both people were wearing masks and just going about their daily routines - which is more analogous to the situation most of us face? We don’t know because that’s not what the study looked at. Other evidence seems to indicate that widespread mask wearing is an important tool (not 100% by any means) to reduce community spread. For the record, I agree that cloth masks are less effective than surgical masks which are less effective than n95 masks which are less effective than n95 masks plus a face shield etc. etc. But what’s frustrating to me (and I think others) is this attitude that because face-coverings, especially improvised cloth ones, aren’t 100% effective, they’re useless and silly and tyrannical. My advice is to drop this argument."
"Linda, you should drop the argument. The virus doesn't say to itself ""I am in a health care setting so I wont infect anyone"". LOL. The setting doesn't matter, except that it transmits easier indoors than outdoors. The only setting indoors that makes a difference would be the ventilation. Regarding the 14th Amendment, you are correct that if it is NOT a law that everyone from those states must quarantine and just a recommendation. I was under the impression it was a temporary law. The 17% effective number I threw out there was actually from a Dr. who I saw talking on TV about masks. But, the actual study documented in medical journals clearly says 97% of particles can penetrate cloth masks. Therefore, only 3% effective would be the correct figure based on this recent study. Now, perhaps we can get this thread back on subject regarding this quarantine ""suggestion"" from outside states.Edited: 1:26 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"All Red States on the list. Not political? yeah, right.Where is California? Oh yeah, they are blue. Didn’t the governor threaten to sue Rhode Island for this same plot?"
"Kurt2fish, Washington is also on the list. As you may know from my posts on this thread, I'm not a fan of the policy (or the person who spearheaded it in NY), but it *is* data-based. These are the states that are currently above a threshold rate of infection.Is the threshold arbitrary? Sure, any cut-off figure is going to be somewhat arbitrary.Is there an element of tit-for-tat? Very possibly (I guess Texas also imposed a mandatory quarantine requirement on people flying in from NY at some point). But does it specifically target Red states? No."
"Supposedly from the latest article I have read, Washington was on the list in error and has been taken off."
"I am hoping to go to Acadia national Park in Maine in AugustI have been on the fence because of the Quarentine, I spoke to the Hotel I would stay at ,and the hotel told me me the quarentine was a joke, All I have to do is sign a letter saying I don't have the virus and the hotel didn't care otherwiseBar Habor, ME needs the tourists more than NYC does as its a total tourist town, NYC will survive, but there are other places that might need the help"
"Gee thanks, howardform. In case you truly want to follow the rules, you will find the Certificate of Compliance on this page:https:/…keepmainehealthyFrom some of your previous posts, you have also indicated you're not crazy about wearing a mask. Please be aware that many businesses will be requiring that you wear one. Sadly, a consortium of Maine businesses has just had to announce a ""Let's Be Kind"" campaign to protect their workers and customers.Last I knew, Bar Harbor had zero covid cases. I'm pretty sure they'd like to keep it that way."
"I have not made a final decision on going to Acadia yet...I will have a mask with me, I do wear one when going inside, its outside that I usually dontI am not going to go to Acadia National Park unless there is some lifting of the Quanrentine. I actually am hopeful.It was the hotel that volunteered the information, I didn't ask them, They clearly need the business, I really have no intention of breaking any laws."
"The cleck at the hotel even told me there was someone at the hotel from NY (Obviously my very strong NY Accent and NY License plate is a dead giveaway for me, I couldn't hide too easily)"
"Kurt2fish, you’re right...Washington is no longer on the list. I appreciate the correction.I do think that if this policy is pursued seriously, the list of states is going to be in a constant state of flux."
"Below there is a link to a peer reviewed medical journal with a study that show masks work. They are recommended by the CDC, WHO, many state health departments. They do not take the place of social distancing but in a place like NYC in many neighborhoods social distancing is not possible. Studies about hospital settings are not relevant. That deals with medical providers who are providing treatment to COVID patients and obviously the patients can't have a mask on when they are intubating patients which is an aerosol generating procedure that is is very risky. ""With face masks, the chance of infection or transmission was 3% with a mask compared with 17% without a mask, a reduction of more than 80%"" - Technically its 17.4% risk without mask to 3.1% chance with. https://www.livescience.com/face-masks-eye-p…https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltextEdited: 3:43 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"Seems like the maine quarantine requirement says if you tested negative within the 72 hours prior to arriving in Maine you don't need to quarantine. That seems reasonable, although getting the test and getting the results back quickly may be difficult for some."
"Red - that’s correct. Based on comments in our forums and the Alaska forums, some people will find the 72 hour turnaround easier to do than others."
My understanding is that Hawaii recently announced it would be going that same route.
"""My understanding is that Hawaii recently announced it would be going that same route."" that makes sense since Hawaii is soo reliant on tourism for their economy. Hopefully airlines will check for proof of negative tests before allowing people to board. There have already been cases where people who know they are covid positive have taken flights anyway. Would suck to lose a vacation to quarantine because someone on the plane ignored the rules."
"Red, you just put your finger on one of my travel nightmares. Being careful, following the rules conscientiously, and then being screwed by someone who did neither. That, more than safety per se, is my biggest hesitation about flying in the current environment."
"I don't know what ""route"" for Hawaii is referred to in #121, but it is my understanding that for months Hawaiian officials have been meeting flights arriving from places other than Hawaiian airports and if a person doesn't have a plan for 14 days quarantine and can't come up with one pretty quickly, then the state of Hawaii buys that person a one-way ticket back to wherever he or she came from. Are they easing up on that rule?"
"According to a recent post on the Hawaii forums, starting August 1 upon arrival at the airport:""1. ****Valid NEGATIVE test 3 days before arrival equals No quarantine. Test results must be in hand.2. No Valid test equals 14 days quarantine.3. Temperature screens and if a 100.4 or more, they will be separated and given time in an air conditioned room before a second temp scan. They will also be offered a CV-19 test."
"A striking description of events, leading to the quarantine, is the Times article:“Florida Smirked at New York’s Virus Crisis. Now It Has Its Own”.https:/…Edited: 7:31 am, June 26, 2020 "
"It easier to quarentine Hawaii than NY , Since almost everyone flies into Hawaii, just check them in at the Airport, there are so many backroads into NY its impossible to monitor the borders"
"Yes, lots of back roads in New York State but the out of state license plate will give it away. Decent people will obey the quarantine. To be completely honest, I'm not a fan of the negative test within 72 hours. In many areas, tests are tough to come by and with surges all over the US, we really should be utilizing testing in better ways than people who want to travel."
"""Decent people will obey the quarantine.""That pretty much says it all. You know...laws and civilized society and all...."
"Yup, I don't disagree with you but I do know many many people who will honor quarantines. There are many good people in this world who understand and care."
"""The out of state license plate will give it away."" There are actually a number of New Yorkers who permanently live here, but have their cars registered in another state to save on auto insurance. This is obviously illegal, but few seem to be caught."
"also folks who live 6 months (or more) elsewhere and have a second home in NY, especially upstate. They'd have out of state plates but could easily quarantine at their NY home for 2 weeks before venturing out"
Texas re-imposing shutdown of bars. First state to go backwards on the re-opening. Interesting.https:/…
"Correct. We have many Floridians, too. And probably any state is cheaper to register a car than NYS. Nonetheless, not every out of state plate means they live in NY and another State."
"There are plenty of Snow Birds who live the winter in Florida and the Summer in NY. They have Florida Plates, but they re really New YorkersF"

"So the cop pulls over a car with FL license plates and the drive talks like he is straight outta Brooklyn, What do you think is supposed to happen"
I don't think the police will be sitting at the border looking to pull over every car with an out of state plate. I do think you have a higher chance of being pulled over and an inquiry being triggered if you have out of state plates. Its not uncommon for criminals to use rental cars to run guns/drugs etc up the coast. Out of state plates in certain neighborhoods or at odd hours have always drawn the attention of cops and I don't see why now would be any different.
"Omg, Red, Brooklyn is full of cars with out of state plates. And this is the first time I’ve ever heard of rental cars being viewed suspiciously. I think the odds of being pulled over because of out of state plates are pretty close to zero. I view this quarantine as aspirational and signal-sending at best. Personally, I think we’re all in this together, and dislike policies that single out particular states. I just hope that people - *wherever* they’re from - will behave responsibly. Whether this quarantine requirement encourages that or detracts from that or has no impact whatsoever remains to be seen."
"Actually its ""probable cause"". Although to pull a car over the police only need to meet the standard of a reasonable suspicion. Don't worry the police will find some basis for the stop. Out tail light, person hit the center line of the road with a tire, one of the bulbs over license plate doesn't work, they smelled the odor of marihuana when they passed the car with the windows down, not coming to a complete stop at the stop sign, etc the list goes on and on. Part of the reason we are seeing the protests."
How many of you have had the personal experience of being in a car that gets pulled over by the cops anywhere in the US?
"*raises hand*Edited: 4:38 pm, June 26, 2020 "
*raises hand*
"@146 & 147 You applied the wrong legal standard for a car stop. I will accept your representation that you previously were an attorney but its clear your field was not criminal law. The information I posted was absolutely correct. I'm not suggesting its appropriate behavior by the police (I'm also not talking about cops who make up the violations [although there are some that do]) because if they follow someone long enough there is usually some minor violation they will see to use as a basis as a stop. I'm stating what the reality is not how they should behave in an ideal world (I am not suggesting I support this practice but this is the reality of how it is). If you had litigated suppression hearings in NYC you would know that these are routine reasons given by the police for car stops and judges routinely deny the suppression of evidence in those types of circumstances.Again though the point isn't really about suppression issues etc, but that there is a higher chance that police typically look closer at cars with out of state plates even more so with rentals (they won't say that is why they stopped the car but that's why they focused on the car in the first place) and if your license says your from a state with high COVID cases there will likely be an inquiry. You aren't going to be litigating the basis for a stop when it comes to being subjected to quarantine requirements which is what we are talking about."
"***How many of you have had the personal experience of being in a car that gets pulled over by the cops anywhere in the US?***Just like ter1413, I’ve been pulled over many times over the years."
"Hi Kaye, just to answer I have, and to a few of Ter1413's questions too. I'm driving with SC plates, and still have a house on Staten Island. Already been subject to undue scrutiny when a truck I was behind, doing the same speed, went on his way while I got pulled over in a radar trap in the nonsensical speed limits.Edited: 6:24 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Again the standard for police to stop a car and request a license (a requirement in NY vehicle and traffic law) in New York is NOT probable cause. It is reasonable suspicion a much lower standard. Probable cause deals with further searches/arrest etc. Not really relevant when it comes to the topic at hand which is simply a car stop. As mentioned above I am not saying I agree with the police acting this way and I am not talking about cases where they make up fact patters to justify the stop. I'm merely stating the reality of what happens on NYC streets. I'm not going to engage in this back and forth further. Some people will never be convinced, but below is the relevant case law in the state of New York and anyone who is claiming this is not the law is either ignorant of the law or intentionally misleading people. Any attorney who handles these cases in New York should be aware of the court of appeals case People v. Ingle being that it addresses this very issue. ""A single automobile traveling on a public highway may be stopped for a ""routine traffic check"" when a police officer reasonably suspects a violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.""""It should be emphasized that, in the context of a motor vehicle inspection ""stop"", the degree of suspicion required to justify the stop is minimal. Nothing like probable cause as that term is used in the criminal law is required.""""It should be emphasized that the factual basis required to support a stop for a ""routine traffic check"" is minimal. An actual violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law need not be detectable. For example, an automobile in a general state of dilapidation might properly arouse suspicion of equipment violations. All that is required is that the stop be not the product of mere whim, caprice, or idle curiosity. It is enough if the stop is based upon ""specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion"" ""https:/…197544936ny2d4131390"

"""You actually see more travel questions for upstate now than the city as you can travel to various upstate locations."" I'm thinking the tourism industry for upstate new york is going to do quite well this summer, mainly with regional domestic travelers. Not a lot opened up in the city at the moment that would draw tourists and when it gets really hot NYC isn't really enjoyable to walk around outside compared to the outdoors of upstate.Edited: 8:03 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"In general I know summer is travel season, but NYC really isnt that nice to visit in the summer. Its hot and Humid. I hardly went in to Manhattan in the summer before the Pandemic (I havent been to Manhattan since February),"
"Gov Cuomo added more states for 14-days self-quarantines: California, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Tennessee. The state previously mandated quarantines for travelers from Alabama, Florida, Texas, Arizona, Utah, Arkansas, North Carolina and South Carolina. Total 16 states. https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/06…"
Let’s be clear about language: it’s any state whose rate of infection exceeds the standard. States can come off the list when they get the virus under control. It’s about the numbers.
More states added to the list today.
"It’s ok ter, I hardly went to Queens the summer before the pandemic (Ferry to Astoria for the Noguchi museum may have been the only time in the summer of 2019.

Now he wants to to the same thing he previously criticized.Some countries have said that if you enter their country, you need to have a document no older that 72 hours stating the you were negative for COVID. NY,NJ or CT could have done that but instead they assumed every one entering the state from other areas with high numbers is sick. It's like being arrested because you MIGHT commit a crime.

"It would be totally impractical, to have people show some sort of document with test results. Plus, there isn't enough manpower here to do that. Hawaii and possibly some other states and countries may be doing that, but many, including most of Europe, are not. They are simply barring everyone arriving from US."

@176 Actually what trump was proposing was telling people in New York they are not allowed to leave the state. That would be unconstitutional. What new york is doing is saying if you come from specific states with high COVID numbers you have to self-quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. Major difference. There are exceptions for essential workers etc. Nobody is saying people can't travel to New York only that the need to self quarantine. Florida and some other states have the same type of rules in place this is hardly a new policy.
"***This quarantine is poorly decided and a bit hypocritical.***Cuomo and Murphy want this to go on for as long as possible. Cuomo stopped daily press conferences, but that didn’t last long. Indoor dining was supposed to start in NJ today, but Murphy canned that a few days ago, with no clear answer as to when indoor dining will be allowed.Both of these guys are power hungry and want to maintain control. I asked earlier about proof that “they are watching flights”, nothing from that person who made that claim."
"Springerandy, I tend to agree with you on the quarantine (amazing, I know!), which I view as poorly conceived grandstanding.The delay of indoor dining, in contrast, I think is a reasonable response to what’s been learned from the experience of other states. Not that one can’t still argue about it, but it seems to me to be in a different category."
"On ""they are watching flights,"" I'm quite certain I read somewhere or heard on TV that they might (not necessarily ""would"") do random checks -- like meet a flight and ask all the passengers to fill out forms with their details, including where they can be reached over the next 14 days. Obviously, if someone wasn't planning to be here for 14 days, was just here for 3 or 4 or 5 days, like a long weekend, officials might suggest they not leave the airport -- just get on the next flight back to wherever they came from, unless they could claim an exception.Even the Dept of Homeland Security -- DHS -- doesn't check those people still coming in from otherwise barred countries and subject to 14 day quarantine (often US citizens resident abroad either returning for good or temporarily). I have heard stories of people being shocked because not only did nobody ask them about their health, take their temp,etc, but nobody asked where they would be for the next 14 days (so of course there was no followup to see if they were really there and feeling okay). I think one person mentioned being asked if she had been to China recently."
"This disease is all about the numbers. One infected person can be the cause of a huge cluster. And it takes a while after infection for symptoms to manifest, so someone can be infecting others before they know they have it. The purpose of the self quarantine, like every other part of limiting the spread of this disease, is to engage people in VOLUNTARY behavior that limits the spread. They want you to wear a mask because it slows the spread, and now they're asking people to self quarantine because it slows the spread. It's not that they're looking to catch people to penalize them, they want to make people invest in our collective health care. So for all of the people who are worrying about enforcement mechanisms, you're picking the wrong fight - the fight is to make people understand that choosing to follow this directive is a way to do something good for the larger community. The minimal sacrifice is all we're being asked to do, just as in the beginning we were asked to just stay the #$&% at home to stop the spread.There are many people (like my law abiding parents) who will just suck it up and stay home in self quarantine for two weeks, simply because they believe in obeying the law and believe in being good citizens. I don't understand arguing about enforcement instead of arguing about how to get people to invest in exercising good judgement? After all, so many others are making much greater sacrifices. I have ethical concerns about asking people to make the kind of sacrifice some people are making in connection with finding a vaccine, but I have unlimited respect for the people choosing to do so, and their commitment to making the world safer. This sacrifice is extraordinary. https:/… So if you're a snowbird and coming back from Florida, or visiting friends or family coming from Texas, stay at home for two weeks. It's not that hard. Don't do it because you might get a $2000 ticket. Don't not do it because enforcement is weak. Do it because it's the safer thing for the country to stop the spread. If you call yourself a patriot, stop the spread already so we can all go back to work, all shop normally, and all start eating in restaurants again.Edited: 8:22 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"Yes, I have heard of returning Americans subject to quarantine going home and isolating for 14 days because, even though the fools who work for DHS either didn't understand or didn't care about the law, they did."
">>>I don't understand arguing about enforcement instead of arguing about how to get people to invest in exercising good judgement?<<<And that is precisely why I think the quarantine is misguided. It focuses on arbitrary political boundaries, numerical cut-offs and the threat of steep fines (therefore *inviting* the focus on enforcement we’ve seen on this thread) rather than good judgment & responsibility."
"So if people weren't exercising good judgment, how would you do it, Linda? I'm genuinely curious. As others stated, a test for everyone traveling into the state wouldn't work. How do you get people from states where they have not taken the virus seriously and aren't exercising good behavior to just not come to NY and reinfect us all. I would posit (I could be very wrong here), that the loss to the state of NY and the loss to individual people is greater than anywhere else, and none of us want to go backwards...how would you stop people from coming to the state and re-infecting?"
(I'm making the assumption that we are on the same page with regard to goals. It's the methodology you disagree with. I don't know whether a quarantine is the best solution...I just take it as the one we've been offered.)
The problem is without enforcement we have already seen some people will not exercise good judgement. Heck you still have people arguing over wearing a face mask and its effectiveness. Without the threat of possible fines for getting caught I can just see some people thinking they will make a summer trip to New York from a designated state for leisure and doing whatever they want without self quarantine. Anything that discourages people from flocking to New York from a COVID hot zone is a good thing as far as I am concerned. We have seen how irresponsible some in the country are so I dont think its reasonable to expect people to suddenly take this seriously.
"Risa - It’s tough, because there’s been no national strategy or coordination. All NY can really do is focus on behavior within its borders. Insist on masks and distancing. Postpone reopening of indoor dining (and esp drinking) as we’ve done. Keep tourist destinations closed. If the concern is that great, then close hotels to all but essential travel.Quarantine requirements in a state as big and porous as NY, as I’ve tried to make clear, are IMO bound to be ineffective. The people who will be responsible enough to observe them are likely to be the people who were responsible in the targeted state and would also be (or would have been) responsible here. People like your parents, say. Meanwhile, folks who were in the crowded bar in East Lansing in my former state of Michigan - the source of a cluster of I think 150 cases and counting - are free to come here and party in the East Village, because the statewide average for Michigan is well below the quarantine threshold. To think we’re the least bit safer because we’re maintaining an ever-changing list of states that fall just above or just below an arbitrary, lagging cut-off is foolish (IMO).Since you asked!Edited: 8:51 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"""To think we’re the least bit safer because we’re maintaining an ever-changing list of states that fall just above or just below an arbitrary, lagging cut-off is foolish (IMO)."" The states above the cutoff line are on an upswing and will likely be on the list for weeks maybe even months. Its not like there are states that will be on the list one week and off the next week and then back three weeks later. If a state is crossing the line in terms of numbers there is a significant problem and its not going away anytime soon."
"I agree with Red. I have no interest in having bored people, possibly virus laden people, from Florida or Texas or Arizona coming to NYC to get away from whatever is going on where they live, and anything that discourages them is a good thing in my opinion.I was just listening to a discussion of some of the things other countries -- countries that were generally more successful than us dealing with the virus -- did that we didn't do. Number one was restricting travel within the country (of course, these determinations were made at national level in those countries, and we don't have planning at national level, so is left to states to do best they can).Edited: 8:59 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"""Number one was restricting travel within the country (of course, these determinations were made at national level in those countries, and we don't have planning at national level, so is left to states to do best they can)."" Correct and Linda made this exact same point. In the US though it would need to be a coordinated response between the federal and state governments. Neither can effectively do something like that on their own, but if all were on the same page it could be accomplished. Honestly in terms of the economy a regional approach makes sense. Seems like they would want to protect the regions that can generate economic movement to help support the states being forced into shutdown. This is not like the start of the pandemic where the virus was all over the place and we just didnt have the testing to know where it was. We know where its spreading and where its not spreading at this point so we can utilize this type of regional approach for the good of the country."
"Linda, we are 95% on the same page, and where we are not is just a matter of how you look at it, not a fundamental difference in aspirations.The things you mention that NY is doing already are all good. And I suspect (and the governor broadly hinted) that keeping indoor dining in NYC shut down is to disincentivize people from coming in to the state. He can't shut down tourism entirely - the people against it are just too outraged. But it appears to me that he is trying to find ways to disincentivize coming to the city and state. And there will be people who see that there's a quarantine and say ehhh, forget it, I'll wait. It will turn people off, some people. And others, like my parents, who follow the laws...well, some of them may have been infected (someone I know just told me today of someone who was following all behaviors recommended and came down with it, and has no idea how. It happens. It's highly contagious). So anyone who follows the rules, everyone who follows the rules, those are cases that will be contained. You can focus on the percentage who won't follow, or you can look at the numbers who do follow. And every single person who does follow them is saving lives that they dont' even know about. You can't prove the absence of a negative, but we know that the less people out there infecting others, the better. You never get 100% compliance with laws - ever. Some people stopped drinking and driving because of public education, or stopped texting and driving, but some still do both, and a small percentage will have accidents. People run red lights, and when they do, a small percentage get into accidents. Most don't get caught, most don't get into accidents. We don't focus on all of the people who do follow the law, but they are saving lives when they do, as will the people who follow the quarantine. And that's why it's there. Without it, trust me, my parents would not have gotten a test, and they would have seen at least 5 of their 8 grandchildren by now (and their great grandchild), not to mention their kids. But because of the quarantine, I was able to talk them in to getting a test and they're staying home. There are thousands like them. And each one is saving lives. So yes, there are people who aren't following the quarantine, and we will see the numbers increase. But without it, and without the PSAs about masks, and without the other rules, we would be Texas, or Georgia. Or Alabama. or Whatever. (but we could never be Florida. Those people are just beyond stupid. There isn't a word for them yet.)This study comes close to proving that the absence of a negative actually is a positive.https:/…Edited: 9:19 pm, July 02, 2020 "

"Well, I am glad to see no one has an answer as to how these arbitrary State quarantines can possibly be enforced. Any talk of wishing for an ""honor system"" is just plain silliness."
"Quarantine requests + no indoor dining + no,bars + no attractions = people staying away due to lack of options for entertainment.  You can’t seal the borders, but you can make it less attractive to come visit."
"I live in a beach town that is known for 4th of July celebrations. We have been invited to several parties, but I plan on staying home and comforting my terrified pets. I understand that the location of the Macy's fireworks has not been disclosed in order to avoid crowds gathering to watch. If I am wrong about that, please correct me. There's talk of BLM protests out in the Hamptons. Wishing everyone a peaceful and blessed Independence Day."
"I don't think anyone believes that ""the honor system"" will result in enforcement - but I do know good people who will abide by it and out of respect for the citizens of this State who have been through hell, we hope people will take it seriously. As for other enforcement: ""You know, you can speed in your car, and if you don’t get caught, you’re fine,” Cuomo said on CNN. “You can drink too much and get in a car and drive home, and if you don’t get caught, you’re fine. But if you fly into New York, we’ll have your name, we’ll know where you’re supposed to be staying, there will be random checks.”Edited: 9:24 am, July 03, 2020 "
">>>Cuomo: ”But if you fly into New York, we’ll have your name, we’ll know where you’re supposed to be staying, there will be random checks.”<<<This is the kind of bluster that turns people (or at least this person) off. Really? There are officials standing by at airports, checking IDs and collecting hotel/residence information? And an enforcement infrastructure in place to make random telephone calls/knock on doors and then follow up? Has *anyone* heard reports this is happening? To the extent people on this thread are focused on enforcement, rather than the underlying ethical case for responsible behavior, I blame credulity-straining statements like this. Meanwhile, one major ongoing violation of state/city requirements that the authorities *are* in a position to act on is NYPD cops not wearing masks. I saw several hundred violators yesterday but am not holding my breath that any will face discipline. (In fact, a number of the unmasked, non-distanced individuals were supervisors.)"
Weren't there a number of flights in the last year or so where passengers were exposed to measles? How did they track/contact those at risk?
"For contact tracing, I assume they’d use passenger manifests. (Which of course won’t have information about where people are planning to stay at their destination.)"
"Quite honestly, i don't care if it turns people off. We don't need the risk."

Cuomo wants power and control, same with Murphy."
"It is unlikely airlines would cooperate in providing passenger manifests. They haven't previously when the info was requested for contact tracing. Nor have they on their own taken the initiative to contact other passengers when they find out one or more passengers on a flight tests positive. It's different in many other countries, where cooperation is required by law."
"Of course enforcement is going to be limited. Hopefully, the majority of people will be honest and do the right thing. I'm happy about the quarantine because in my work there is no such thing as physical distancing. I wear a surgical mask and my patients wear a cloth mask (though they need lessons on the correct way to wear it). I have a patient that is going to one of the ""hot spots"" and she is voluntarily quarantining when she gets back, however, if she didn't we would still tell her that she needs to wait the 14 days before she can come back to see me. Without the quarantine rules, I would not be able to do that."
"I believe Murphy has kidney cancer. Actually, I think he had just been released from hispital following surgery when this began. He has never given me impression he is power hungry --sick perhaps, tired perhaps, but not power hungry. Maybe he will seem more power hungry as his condition improves.I think if NYS starts to see links between virus cases here and travelers from other states,then they will find a way to get the info they need."

"george: That is really interesting. When I went to dentist about 2 weeks ago they took my temp and maybe asked 1 or 2 questions, but nothing formal.

"QQ2 - Our guidelines have changed as things have evolved. Before we had community spread in our area, we asked people if they had been out of the county, had contact with a known covid+ person or had any of the symptoms. Once we had community spread in our area, we stopped asking about being outside of the county. Now that we have very few cases in our county but other areas of the country have increased spread, we are starting to ask about travel again, in addition to taking temps, asking about known contact with covid+ person and if the person had any covid symptoms in last 14 days.To me, it makes sense. If an area has very few cases and those people are isolated, the only way it's going to increase is if people travel around and bring it (back) to the area. Obviously nothing is 100%.#214 - to clarify, I work for a hospital but not in the hospital itself, it is an off site outpatient clinic so similar to a chiropractors office but we follow hospital policies"
"FYI -New York State has set up a way for residents to report violators of the new travel advisory issued to include more states this week.Initially the restriction, which states that anyone traveling outside of New York to a state with a higher infection rate needs to quarantine for 14-days upon return.When that quarantine mandate was announced, some asked ‘how’ exactly the state would make it happen.Turns out there will be a form on the state website for residents to report others for violating.Governor Andrew Cuomo says airports will also be tracking people who fly into the state.“We are working with the airlines for them to give passengers upon landing a slip where you have to fill out who you are, where you are, where you are coming from, where you are going,” Cuomo said. “They’ll be collected by the Port Authority and entered into a database. We will then do random checks off that database.”"
I'm sure this guy will comply with the self-quarantine requirement when he returns from Florida. He wouldn't even wear the mask on the plane.https:/…
There are seious constitutional issues here. 4th and 14th amendments come to mind. This is defacto house arrest without being charged or convicted of a crime. I can see a bunch of Habeas Corpus motions in the near future if enforcement is really stepped up.  Actually New Jersey can't enforce this without violating a federal court settlement that requires the state to prove medical necessity to order an individual into quarantine. I doubt coming from a certain state is going to be enough to justify the order.

And one that looks particularly bad in retrospect, given where things are now. I'm very happy he came around. Wish he could admit past mistakes. It would make the public believe more in the current quarantine if he admitted he was wrong in the past. And it REALLY was a bad look when he made it look like this was a tit-for-tat thing with Florida by mentioning them quarantining NYers months ago. But you couldn't ask for a better way to keep the virus around forever than to have free travel between high infection areas and low infection ones... and then back again, and back again..._______To be honest, I'd rather we just did what Maine is doing - rather than a list of specific states, the quarantine applies to anyone from outside of the northeast region. But that's tougher for us because we (and NJ) border other states outside the ""safer"" region.Edited: 2:38 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"""Wish he could admit past mistakes."" He has over, and over. He has said that he takes full responsibility for all of the decisions made, but credits New Yorkers - all New Yorkers - for all of the success in getting ""down the mountain."" He has said that numerous times. I find it funny that often the same people who think he took too long to shut down NY, when no one really understood what was going on are the same people who think we aren't opening fast enough. And the same people who hold him responsible are the ones questioning every decision he makes. And the ones saying quarantine won't work are the same ones saying it's not enforceable. He has had a very clear message:: regular people will make this thing go away. Everyday New Yorkers should: Wear a mask. Exercise social distancing. If you're coming from a place with a high rate of transmission, self quarantine. This requires cooperation of the people. The interest here isn't ticketing people, it's making people CHOOSE to participate in our own safety. That's the focus. That is the entire strategy. It relied on people exercising self discipline. He resisted shutting down at first because he hoped people would choose to distance themselves. He resisted issuing an executive order on masks but instead went with public awareness campaigns. He cautioned over and over about rising numbers in other states and only when that wasn't working he issued the quarantine order. Sure, the enforcement is weak. That's because it is not about his personal power but rather a symbol and an encouragement and an incentive. Stay home, or self isolate. I think he's been pretty clear."
I think it is likely that the Governors of NY/ NJ/CT were aware of the contentiousness of the advisory and had the foresight to examine laws and precedent with an awareness of the potential controversy and inevitable legal challenges.
"""I find it funny that often the same people who think he took too long to shut down NY, when no one really understood what was going on are the same people who think we aren't opening fast enough."" Eh... I guess there are people who just want to criticize, but the facts show we clearly took too long to shut down. That said, I've been very happy with the pace of reopening, ESPECIALLY the decision to postpone indoor dining and bars, despite those being 2 of my favorite activities before the pandemic. Anyway, I have no complaints whatsoever about the NY pandemic response since April or so onwards; even Fauci has directly mentioned NY as a model of a state that actually uses science to determine reopening."
"""I think it is likely that the Governors of NY/ NJ/CT were aware of the contentiousness of the advisory and had the foresight to examine laws and precedent with an awareness of the potential controversy and inevitable legal challenges."" - exactly.

I think Cuomo has done well but there were some missteps early on and they took too long to shutdown, because it was a situation where with each passing day lives were being lost as a result of the inaction. Its like they were in denial about what was happening. I think part of the problem in NYC is the clown we have has a mayor. His antics have really harmed the city and while cuomo is not blameless in their spats its become pretty clear to me that the mayor is the main problem.Edited: 3:21 pm, July 04, 2020 "
