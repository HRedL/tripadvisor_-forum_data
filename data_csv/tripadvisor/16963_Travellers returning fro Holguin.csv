What is happening with flights coming back from Holguin with 12-20 passengers suffering from intestinal problems and flu like symptoms. A few passengers were actually hospitalized.
"If you go to the main Cuba forum at this link:tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g147270-i91-Cuba…You will find literally dozens of threads on this subject, far too many to list here."
"There are a dozen different explanations....Some people say it's some kind of stomach flu ,others food poisoning,ect ect .....My husband and I were in one of those planes and he is sick( to the point that he had to go to the hospital and hooked up to IV ) for dehydration....I ,on the other hand, am totally fine and we drank and ate pretty much the same.So it's a hit and miss and some of it depends how you (and your stomach) can handle cultural change. For our next trip,though we will take Dukarol just to be on the safe site.....Don't let it spoil your trip"
It is probably just a bug going around the hotel.. Happened to me a few years ago and hubby was fine..HAppens in Canada too..Doubt it was food poisoning..You are right depends on your system etc.
If people are coming from varadero sick and holguin the surly it can't be food from one resort. And if people have traveled for only one week could of been something they picked up befor or during travel. Not long ago all the primary school children here were sick. Same symptoms. From several school. It was simply a bug and with one child in a school of hundreds it travels fast and wide. Scary but it happens all over the world.
"Remember the swine flue epidemic? Unfortunately, it happens."
"It's the flue season, many people in Holland got it right now, don't blame a country.And the swine flue thing, more people in the US and the UK got it that time than in Mexico, but Mexico whas the first that reported it, but it looks that it came from the US.And the big medicine guy's were happy to sell expensive medicines !!"
"I have not seen any reports from Varadero Just Holguin with planes landing in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto.. and 4 hotels that I have read were mentioned..All it takes is one person the the plane going to different resorts and it spreads..."
~~All it takes is one person the the plane going to different resorts and it spreads...~~~Amen
Dukoral will not protect you from a gastrointestinal virus.
Only one report so far from a retuning UK traveller.
WOW Bellagio so I guess it is all here in Canada..
"It does seem like it is dying down a bit Bellagio. No Canadian carriers have reported ill passengers since Saturday. I know that Cubana, Canjet and Westjet all had flights arriving in the last few days to Ontario.The last Canadian news report stated that resorts were implementing strict sanitization rules etc......we can hope! Most people that have reported were part of a much larger group...of which most got sick. Makes sense if they were all spending a lot of time together."
"I must admit I'm at a loss to know why only one returning Brit has mentioned it. It's not made any news bulletins over here at all. Maybe later on it the week, who knows?"
Yes they do seem to be groups Wedding party form Montreal 28/29 were ill..Canjet plane returning
Glad to hear that there are no fresh reports.
Maybe the Brits as we know stay for 2-3 weeks and Canadians 1.. Hope that they will be ok and the bug has gone.. You will see I guess this weekend.
poupoun:There is already a report in from one Brit who landed back into Gatwick this morning.Reply # 31 on this thread:tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g285732-i398-k50…
Yes but one is nothing compared to Canada.. Glad we werent there then right?? Poor people.. HAppened to me my first trip 6 yrs ago at Club Amigo Not fun bit not the fault of the hotels..
