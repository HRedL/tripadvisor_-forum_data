"HiCan anyone advise , see FCO advice below , it has exceptions in Sharm El Sheik area ? Confusing??Does this mean we can travel to Sharm ??The FCO advise against all travel to:the Governorate of North Sinai.The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:the Governorate of South Sinai, except the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq.the area west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions, excluding the coastal areas between the Nile Delta and Marsa Matruh (as shown on the map)."
"“ Does this mean we can travel to Sharm ??”No it doesn’t If you look at the top of the page it advises against all but essential travel to all countries apart from those exempt Egypt is not on the exempt list KarenEdited: 2:03 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"Thanks for your reply Karen , the FCO advice states country’s and territories, I know Egypt is not on the list, just questioning why it has the exception of the areas such as Sharm etc It clearly states all travel except for the areas Conflicting don’t you agree?Hopefully, Egypt will be on the list ASAP , I would go tomorrow if I could"
"HiNo I don’t agree it’s conflicting The advisory at the top of the page totally overrules anything in the body of the text They can’t go on all countries with exceptions and change everything.. the exemption for Sharm has been there a long time because of the issues in Sinai karenEdited: 2:35 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"Karen is right you have to read the whole section relating to the Country you plan to visit. The FCO advice regarding all but essential travel ban over rides everything else, it then goes on to say that if you are in Egypt the following areas are ones to avoid. The area of Sharm has been exempt from this section of the advice for a long time due to its geographical position right at the end of the peninsula, if you have ever travelled out of sharm you will also see that it has a ruddy great wall checking incoming and outgoing vehicles as well, which really keeps it safe.Many people on the Sharm facebooks pages at the moment are hoping that Egypt will get put onto the 'you can now travel' list by the UK government and the good news is that this is being reviewed weekly now, not each three weeks as previous. I think the announcements are now made on Fridays. A good indicator is if the airlines are cancelling flights and Tui and Easy Jet have cancelled all August flights and some September ones. You are able to fly schedule to Egypt but of course if you fly without FCO permission then of course your travel insurance is compromised.Hope you get sorted soon"
"I have posted this info in relation to travel to Hurghada, but I think you'll find it helpful.My travel wasn't considered 'essential' by my insurers, so I spent a long time trying to find alternative insurance.I was eventually directed to BIBA and then to a very helpful person called Sam at a company called Higos. She managed to find me a policy which will insure me for travel to Egypt and for medical cover (but not cancellation) in relation to Covid.I hope this information is useful."
"I don't see any conflict - Their statement could be clearer, admittedlyWhat the FCO 'CURRENTLY' states is:-""The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:the Governorate of South Sinai, except the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq.""So, it's a sort of double negative - You can't go, except for.....It would be a LOT clearer if they just said - You CAN go to "" the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq.""Which is fine, but.....The over-riding advice is, however, you can't go ANYWHERE!! (Except)i.e. this page https://tinyurl.com/y68ldrra states:-The Foreign & Commonwealth Office currently advises British nationals against all but essential international travel. Travel to some countries and territories is currently exempted.This advice is being kept under constant review. Travel disruption is still possible and national control measures may be brought in with little notice, so check our travel guidance.The list of countries you CAN go to is on this page https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…Egypt isn't listed!Edited: 6:09 am, July 30, 2020 "
Dohhh.......Yes.......
"Claire, please make sure you are actually covered for Egypt, and make sure it is in writing."
"Am a bit miffed. My posts have been removed as the Powers That Be seem to think they broke TA guidelines. I have just reread the guidelines and I can't see how they did. I wasn't advertising or self promoting, I just shared my experience in order to help others as I spent hours and hours researching before I could find the right cover. Other people have said which company they got their insurance through and I was actually careful not to give the actual name of the company itself or the full name of the broker. Baffled.To the kind person who suggested I ensure that Egypt is named on the policy, thanks. It's taken a lot of toing and froing, but I've been adamant that the wording needed to be very clear to show I had cover in Egypt, so fingers crossed that the airport authorities will be satisfied.Seeing as my other posts are somehow deemed inappropriate, may I suggest that BIBA was my route to eventually getting cover. They seem to be an advisory service and I don't think that this can therefore be seen as promotional!"
If you travel before advisory lifted then your insurance is null and void.Hopefully you aren't until ban lifted.X
"Hi Caz,With respect, your comment applies to mainstream travel insurers. There are several of us on this forum who have obtained travel insurance, that covers us to travel to Egypt while the restrictions are in place and that insurance also provides health cover for the virus, as required by the Egyptian authorities.Please accept that there are those of us that have spent many many hours research to obtain appropriate insurance and we might know quite a lot about what we are talking about.Thanks and apologies for my correcting you."
"HiI am in Sharm and may have to return to the UK to sort some things out.But I only want to stay a few days.Is that possible, or will I have have to stay at least 14 days in quarantine?Thanks"
"Hi Ken,2 weeks quarantine for arrivals from Egypt I'm afraid and have your online track and trace form completed before arrival. Check out FCO website for the web address of the form.Just finishing my quarantine after returning from Egypt 2 weeks ago. Getting cabin fever now.Alan"
"“... will I have have to stay at least 14 days in quarantine?”I hope so. The purpose of a quarantine is to reduce the virus’ rate of spread by isolating people seen as possible carriers from the general population. If visitors from Egypt are on the 14-days isolation list, then it wouldn’t make much sense to let them wander around for a few days and then quarantine them if they don’t leave the country.Edited: 4:29 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"I meant if I stayed only for a few days in a hotel in quarantine, and then wanted to come back to Egypt.I understand I wouldn't be able to stay with any of my family or friends.Would I be allowed to see them, or would I have to stay in a hotel room for 14 days watching TV?Could I go to a supermarket or off licence?Sorry but I am not sure if self isolating for 14 days means that literally.I"

"If you travel from an exempt country but have been in a country that is not exempt within the last 14 days, you will need to self-isolate for the remainder of the 14 days since you were in a non-exempt country. For example, if you arrive in the UK from a country that is exempt, but you travelled to the exempt country 4 days ago from a country that is not exempt you will need to self-isolate for 10 daysDoes that mean if you go to a country which is exempt, from Sharm, for 14 days,then the UK, you do not have to self isolate in the UK?Even more confused."
"What’s confusing? The virus’ incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) is estimated to be around 14 days max. Therefore, if you spend at least 14 day’s in an exempt country, why would you need to quarantine when you get to the UK?Of course you could/should be subject to quarantine when you arrive in the exempt country. A friend of mine just arrived in Italy after a few months in Hurghada and is now self isolating at home for 14 days or so.Nor does “exempt” mean you can’t catch the virus in the country in question. The risk is just thought to be low enough that that a quarantine isn’t necessary. This is subject to change as the risk is re-evaluated on a regular basis, eg Spain."
"Hi Ken,“If you travel from an exempt country but have been in a country that is not exempt within the last 14 days, you will need to self-isolate for the remainder of the 14 days since you were in a non-exempt country.”Yes, you will still need to self-quarantine on your arrival in the UK, for 14 days. I am sure it was Karen K that helpfully pointed out to me and others, that transit / stopover through an exempt country is not a way around the rules. Personally, I always intended to do the required quarantine.“For example, if you arrive in the UK from a country that is exempt, but you travelled to the exempt country 4 days ago from a country that is not exempt you will need to self-isolate for 10 days”If you mean can you clock up days in UK exempt countries (with an agreement for travel with Egypt) before your arrival in the UK, in order to reduce your quarantine days in the UK?I would sincerely hope not. It would rather defeat the purpose of quarantine. “Does that mean if you go to a country which is exempt, from Sharm, for 14 days,then the UK, you do not have to self isolate in the UK?”As far as I can see (always happy to hear when I might go wrong), If you leave Sharm, spend 14 days in a country that has an agreement with Egypt and an agreement with the UK, then when you arrive in UK you will not have to self-quarantine.I do apologise, it is late now and my eyesight is failing. On my first day out of quarantine, I will go to Barnard Castle to check it out."
"Just want to clarify as I didn't know this until Lesley 150 sent the link. Thanks.We can go to a country from Egypt, which doesn't have a 14 day quarantine rule on arrival.Then go to the UK and not have to self isolate?I only need a few days in the UK to sort things out, but wouldn't mind a 14 day holiday in a country where I didn't have to self isolate, then go to the UK with no risk.Does anyone know which countries people can go to from Egypt and not have to quarantine!Thank you Lesley for the link."
Sorry Alan.I did not see your reply before I sent my last.Thanks.Glad your quarantine has now finished. Where did you self isolate?I am single and do not really understand if the 14 day quarantine means you cannot meet your family or friends or anybody for 14 days.Thanks for your reply
"You're welcome Ken and regarding post 22, you are right unfortunately as far as i know. So you could go from Egypt to Italy and then fly from Italy to the UK and not have to quarantine."
"But, you would probably have to quarantine on arrival in Italy.Edited: 9:57 am, August 01, 2020 "
Yes you would need to quarantine in Italy for 14 days Egypt isn’t on there exempt list Karen
"It's all a bit silly at the moment, it will have changed by the time you get there. But when you fly out, check-in scans your passport etc, and it gets scanned when you land. Do you really think you can go around un-noticed?"

"So all I have to do now is find a country which is on the UK exempt list and does not require anyone arriving from Egypt to self isolate for 14 days.Spend 14 days holiday there, then go to the UK and not have to self isolate?It is getting silly, confusing and contrary but it's in the rules."
"Yes it’s getting silly. If the relevant governments are on the ball (a risky assumption, admittedly), you wont find one. After all, the country that lets you in to pass 14 days quarantine free before flying on to the UK is gambling on you being virus free and putting its own population at risk for your convenience, Why not bite the bullet and either wait for the UK to take Egypt off the “essential travel only” list or just self isolate and be done with it?"
"Pegasus have resumed flights to and from Istanbul and Sharm and Hurgada today, 3 times a week.Not sure if you have to self-isolate when you get to Turkey though."
"Ken Thompson, your real name, is it Dominic Cummings by any chance?"
I am also confused because Tui are sarting flights 12 Sep and they promise no flights to quarantine on return areas
tui are resuming holidays to sharm 12 Sep and the promise no flights to quarantine areas
"What do you meand with ""they promise no flights to quarantine areas"" ?"
The problem with that is that the areas from which return will require quarantine are changing more often that many people change their socks. They would have to do an awful lot of rescheduling and reorganising!
"I have read this article from 17th Aug which may help explain. https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales… -“Tui confirmed that no holidays will go ahead to any destination where a customer will be required to quarantine on arrival or upon return to the UK.However, holidays to popular destinations including Greece, Croatia and Portugal are currently still available - although the situation is being closely monitored.Speaking to North Wales Live, a TUI UK spokesperson said: “As per our TUI Holiday Promise, we won’t take customers on holiday if we know they're required to quarantine on arrival or on their return home.“We’re closely monitoring Government advice and should this change, we’ll adapt our holiday programme and proactively contact all impacted customers to discuss their options.“If a customer’s holiday can’t go ahead due to COVID-19, they’ll have the option to receive a refund credit note for the full value of their holiday or a cash refund.”-As far as I can see, they are selling holidays, but it doesn't mean that they will go."
It states on their app and website...we only take you on holiday where their is no quarantine on return!!!!
I have been saying since 27th June that TUI have cancelled everything currently from UK to Egypt.Even Travel Agent system shows no flights this year here in Resort and I Know TUI are showing Marsa Alam still but I can assure you they will not be taking off.Unfortunately some here do not like the truth with TUI and yes affected my business.I would not travel under FCO advice it's there for a reason.
