"My wife and I will be in Amsterdam for a 2 day stay. I am wondering how safe we should feel exploring the RLD and everything it has to offer on one of our nights. Are there any other saftey concerns we should have, or areas to avoid.Thanks! "
Hi Rookie- I just returned from Amsterdam a few weeks ago. I went to the RLD several times both during the day and at night. I felt totally comfortable all the time. There was the occasional person who would pass by and whisper an offer for hard drugs....i.e.....cocaine....but I never felt threatened or unsafe. The RLD is definetly something to see even if you are not into what it has to offer. I would definetly reccomend seeing it.
Rookie- Thought I would add this. In terms of the street dealers....I just ignored them and kept walking. They followed me for a very short distance and then left me alone. Its nothing you wouldn't experience in any big city with an aggressive pan handler or street dealer....just wanted to clarify that for you....enjoy your stay....its a wonderful city.
"yes thats good information, any area , not just RLD , you need to keep alert . There is almost always a heavy police presence in the RLD . There are always picpockets about in heavily used areas in any city and Amsterdam is no exception.Visit the RLD at night to get the best out of it , its always crowded with tourists so you wont be alone. Have fun !"
"I was approached by men a couple of different times, I just smiled, said no thank you and kept on walking. We two women had no problems anywhere at any time of day or night."
I have been around the RLD with my 16 yr old son with no problems whatsoever. Wouldnt have any concerns about going back ...Like any big city watch your bag and ignore the offer of drugs if anyone approaches you. Go with the flow and enjoy. Tania BTW....Dont take any photos of the girls/ lady boys in the windows.....That would cause you problems !!!
"I agree with taniadom, don't photograph the women in the windows or you'll get into trouble. Also watch out for drunken lads on their batchelor party/stag nights. That can get a bit rough and rowdy. I expect the female equivelent can as well, all things being equal!!"
"I just visited the Netherlands two weeks ago. In the RLD, make sure to keep any valuables secure or dont take them at all. We all felt completely safe and comfortable. Each night we walked in the RLD we never were approached by anyone, however, we were vigilant like in any city. It was just that I felt much safer than in any US city after dark. Again, no cameras in RLD. Have fun!"
"Hi, I was there in March. No problems at all. Just make sure to follow what people say about keeping minimal valuables with you and in front of you. It's a very interesting place. Have FUN. You'll miss Amsterdam when you leave, there's something about the carefree atmosphere!K :)"
amsterdam reminds me of NYC before the crack epidemic came.
"I still love NYC, I never tire of it and I feel safer there now then i did when i was younger, Guiliani did clean the city up quite a bit"
"No worries at all, as long as you keep to normal city rules. Don't stray off the beaten track, don't walk alone down the darker allies etc.We walked through at about 9pm and had several offers of highly illegal substances! We just ignored them, carried on walking and they didn't bother us again.Have a brilliant time :-)"
"I have been with my husband to the RLD. No nonsense whatsoever. I was not sure where the streets got very narrow, but otherwise ok.Enjoy!"
My boyfriend and I visited the RLD a couple of times. The only areas where we felt like we were being watched were some of the streets on the way up to the RLD. I would keep all of your valuables back at the hotel and I kept my back under my jacket but I felt safe walking around. It is definitely a sight worth seeing though-the RLD is brilliant
"I never actually had any problems in Amsterdam but it was one of only two cities (the other being Barcelona) where I felt unsafe. Cairo, Marseille, Moscow... those were much less creepy than Amsterdam. I got off the train and literally had to step over piles of bodies (alive, but drunk or stoned) on the pavement outside the train station. There were loud-speakers warning tourists not to accept ""free taxi rides to hotels"", evidently implying they were run by kidnappers or thieves.The one thing I wanted out of Amsterdam was a good Indonesian meal. I looked down the street, saw an Indonesian place, walked over, got a wonderful meal, then went back to the station and got on the first train to Brussels!"
"oh dear , sorry to hear of you problems . Why did you feel unsafe? I dont know of any Indonisian restaurants close to the train station. Anyway , hope you enjoyed your meal ."
"Free taxi rides or indeed walking chaperones to hotels usually imply the hotel is an illegal one, there is a big problem with this in Amsterdam at the moment. It is common sense to most people to not accept something free that you didn't ask for. I never heard of anyone being kidnapped but it is quite common to get ripped off by a taxi that drives you all around the city rather than taking you directly to your destination, if you take an official taxi this won't happen. A few years ago some tourists were having their stuff stolen after they were dropped off in the middle of nowhere but that's not a problem now. "
">oh dear , sorry to hear of you problems . Why did you feel unsafe?Maybe I was expecting chocolates and windmills and wooden shoes... ;-) Seriously, the piles of bodies and the ""free ride"" announcements (in English!) creeped me out. It was my first impression of Amsterdam. It gave the impression of being a debauched, unsafe place. I'd expect such things in Algeria or Cambodia, not north-western Europe.> I dont know of any Indonisian restaurants close to the train station. Anyway , hope you enjoyed your meal . I did, very much! My trip was in 1986, I'm sure things will have changed. Other than the meal, the loudspeakers and the bodies lying around, I don't remember much about Amsterdam. I've never thought of going back, however.>Free taxi rides or indeed walking chaperones to hotels usually imply the hotel is an illegal one, there is a big problem with this in Amsterdam at the moment. It is common sense to most people to not accept something free that you didn't ask for.Good advice. I did get a chaperoned walk to a hotel in Rome once and the hotel was very nice, so I wouldn't call it a hard-and-fast rule.Thanks,Ben"
"hi Ben , yes I think you would find things have changed a bit . I fully agree that Centraal Station was proberbly not the best introduction to the city. There certainly used to be several "" down and outs "" who congregated in that area. Not so much today and there is normally a good police presence there.Another topic on safety in years gonebye is Zeedijk. It certainly wasnt totally safe 30 years ago. But it has been cleaned up and is now perfectly safe for tourists and locals alike.And yes it is possible to get a good hotel from the touts , but wouldnt advise it in Amsterdam, there are plenty of good hotels providing you do a bit of research.regards geoff"
"I'm glad to hear Amsterdam has improved, I might just have to give it a second chance. Thanks!"
do try it again-its a great city to visit
Be extremely careful with your valuables when you are exiting the trains and walking up the stairs to Central Station. I have observed pickpockets who mill around waiting for the crowds and then slide in.....it is very busy at times and there are people jostling all about you. 
"After a recent visit (two weeks ago) I never saw any ""down and outs"" Everything was clean and busy with people sticking to their own business. Although the information, and ticket windows or security were very helpful. I was surprised at the excellent english spoken everywhere. It is embarassing that many of us visitors dont speak dutch."
