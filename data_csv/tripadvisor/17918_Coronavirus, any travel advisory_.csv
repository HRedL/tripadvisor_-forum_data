"Is there any travel advisory from the government or airlines regarding the virus?I am planning to travel to Prague, Vienna and Budapest this coming May. I am asking because I've heard all planes coming from Asia cannot land in Italy. Also in Italy, an Asian tourist guy was beaten just because apparently the suspect is mad about the virus and comes from China.I am Asian coming and residing from USA. Do I need to worry?"
"Mostly harmless.Don't panic, but don't forget your towel."
"At the moment there is nothing to worry about, let us hope that in 3 months time the situation remains the same. As of today there appear to have been no confirmed cases in Hungary. But keep an eye on the news - obviously.Sage advice from luftmensch regarding the towel.Edited: 2:09 am, February 21, 2020 "
"when i left budapest 3 weeks ago just after the outbreak chinese planes were at the airport both arriving and departing some peoplewere wearing masks didnt see aybody being abusive or having abuse at them, in fact i was sitting waiting at assistance point and some chinese young people helped me , hope you will be able to travel and enjoy at moment bbc are reporting inncubation and isolation times are 14 days this is the offical world health organisation guidelines,Edited: 10:11 am, February 21, 2020 "
"Just don't wear a mouth mask ...It singles out Asians in Europe as people who might be infected, to be fearful of.Its early days but corona virus seems to have very mild effect on healthy people, but does seem to be more infectious than standard flu which in a bad year can kill 10,000 plus in UK alone."
"There is a screening at the airport, passangers' fever is checked. If anybody has fever, they are put into quarantine instantly, and taken to the isolation hospital."
I;m also concerned as I would be travelling by end of March to Budapest & then Vienna.I'm travelling with my family also.
I am also traveling early May. What is the significance of the towel?
In my opinion everybody should skip travelling in/to the northern hemisphere for the next few weeks. After that we'll see what will happen in/to the world.
"kbzs, sage advice, which sadly will be ignored.pat742, I think that Luftmensch may have been joking (perhaps you are ?): he does that from time to time, humour him."
roman u feeling better
"The only news from Expatloop is that there are currently still no confirmed cases within Hungary: however, a government spokesman admitted that is is very unlikely that Hungary can avoid the virus."
"And I am better, thank you - went to see Mephisto tonight, a Hungarian film made in 1981."
"Roman Citizen can you imagine I had to translate it at a film festival in Kiev back in 1981 more than 5 times!!! Once 2 times in a single day:))) All that went along with some funny comments from my future wife and a University mate (laughing at that super strangely sounding, to them, Hungarian language). We were hiding at that little interpreter's cabin and the audience couldn't understand why I was sometimes fighting hard not to laugh out loud at my partners comments. That was really great fun, especially taking into consideration how serious was the movie itself. The director would surely had killed us all if he'd present:)"
"It's a Tour de Force by the lead actor: some of the Hungarians I know couldn't believe that I was going to see it, but I thought it was wonderful, though perhaps, as my late Father said of many a film, 'it didn't end'. Visually it is a stunning film."
"I can only reiterate, please refrain from, any non essential travel to affected areas, or if you live near such area, consider not traveling at all.Thank you for your understanding.Edited: 8:23 am, February 28, 2020 "
"I saw Mephisto on initial release in London in 1981.Klaus Maria Brandauer gave that brilliant Oscar winning performance, but he spoke his native German in the international release of the movie. Maybe dubbed for its Hungarian release ?Great film but as I recall very much German speaking. (have it as a Pirate Bay / torrent download somewhere, so will give it a check)."
"Maybe now is the time to take advantage of cheaper travel and hotel prices. Thinking of Paris or Rome or Bologna next weekend.Covid-19 threat is massively overstated for healthy people. Also great time to invest in stocks and equity funds, this 12% drop is an unreal opportunity."
"OF COURSE it was all dubbed!His voice belongs to the late Szakácsi Sándor. He dubbed Brandauer in 8 vocal tones. Also he dubbed him in Colonel Redl as well.Naturally all the other foreign stars were dubbed by Hungarian stars.Szabó István's latest movie ""The final report"" just have been release a few days ago. Brandauer is again the main character. I haven't seen the movie yet, but quite a few reviews on the net are not happy with his dubbing by Csankó Zoltán. Also many people say while the movie is not bad, but not as good as Szabó István's earlier flicks.Probably besides the USA, Hungary is the second country in the world that prefers only dubbed movies."
"Eva please,I know that cheap travels sounds attractive, but who wants to be quarantined for 14 or even more days in god knows what conditions. Nowadays it can happen to you absolutely anywhere. All those people who left China on board of a Ukrainian evacuation plane (some were foreigners from Argentina etc) were extremely happy. Then after more than 24 hours of flying up and around and having been frighten to death by violent local crowds (4 places in Ukraine refused to accept them, all along with road blocks, tire burning, clashes with police, AKA Ukrainian hospitality) and being taken to a hastily emptied remote village barrack of the national Guard, now consider this as their greatest mistake. A nice Ukrainian lady even advised the government to open some abandoned hotels in the Chernobil zone... So after that warm welcome many evacuees told their friends that it would probably much better to remain in China. Italy's health care system is already on a verge of collapse under the heavy influx of new patients. So be careful when choosing your destination. I am in the travel business for quite a long time and have seen many dramatic events, but also cancelled my February trip to Hong Kong and the Philippines, whatever lucrative were the HK hotel prices. Usually being the most expensive in the world, but now running around 70-85 $US for THREE nights in 4 star hotels. Normally it would be 150-200 $US for a single night!!! But walking on empty streets in a damned mask and receiving a cup of coffee squeezed under the door and watching all the closed attractions from outside is not my cup of tea. Only positive thing for me, that knowing all the hidden corners of tickets purchasing schemes, I had dirt cheap, flexible tickets valid till the end of the year. By October-November it should be over and then I will gladly fly."

"Béla, I'd reconsider visiting anywhere in Northern Italy now as things are changing so quickly. Sienna, one of my favourite cities, has had its first case and Rome too is looking to be affected very soon with possible museum and restaurant closures.I'd still regard Naploli and Sicilia as safe as anywhere in Europe, although included in general anti-Italy tourist advice.As to Paris, its as safe as my local London, but hit by a downturn in Chinese and I guess very soon American visitors. No way will you be held in quarantine in a typical city hotel where you don't interact with other guests, it's not like the resort hotel on Tenerife. No European area can lock down like Hubei / Wuhan, or even Schengen be rescinded."
"I have the same exact question. Same trip, same time frame. Also from the USA."
"Honestly, this time of year, in Northern hemisphere winter, you're thousand times more likely to catch influenza than Covid-19.Travelling to Central Europe presents no more risk than walking the streets of New York."
"I disagree with Laura...I would be watching things very closely. To recamtmy earlier.post, while I'm not worried about contracting the virus, I'm very worried about being held for two weeks to make sure I'm not infected. If you are booked with on refundable fares, watch things and don't cancel. If not yet booked, make sure you buy trip insurance or hold.off on booking. Tbh, I suspect fares will only go down anyway.Yes, the normal flu kills far more than Corona virus but the mortality rate of those who do catch it are far lower.Edited: 9:07 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Yeah Chris,I also love those childish comments about influenza. Yeah, there are thousand times more influenza disease cases, but at an average there is ONE mortality per about 1,300 (Thirteen hundred if someone can't get the figures properly) people and ONE mortality for every 29-40 (twenty nine to forty) people, so the difference is tremendous, hence are all the risks and hype.Concerning travel as Eva's advantage of cheaper hotel and ticket prices it's all sounds perfect until you are trapped somewhere like Miami (however that would be a favorite trap for me, until money lasts:) ) cause the whole AA crew refused to fly to Milan (now almost all their flights to Italy have been cancelled through April 25. Even big shots like Juventus are suffering:Italian football club Juventus have quarantined their entire Under-23 squad and cancelled training sessions after four players of their recent opponents US Pianese ASD tested positive for corona virus and those are just a few examples out of thousands similar and zillion more to follow.You definitely better pay a premium for your travel dates could be modified. Just in case...Edited: 10:11 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Seems like the Louvre has closed its doors after a staff union meeting today, staff concerned about their safety and French unions not emasculated like those in the UK.Guess Orsay and other museums will soon follow. Government has banned indoor events of more than 5000 attendance, how soon will Opera and theatre decide to close. All this because of 130 confirmed corona virus cases as I write. This is going to be a massive hit for tourism all around the world. In my town a primary school teacher has been infected, people talking about the issue but as of now no changes in behaviour. I view taking the train to Paris as no more risky than my regular trips into London where I worked for two decades. So if some really cheap Eurostar fares become available with cheap hotel deals I might well pack my bag for a short break."
"Even myself being hit by the drop in tourist arrivals, I still admit that it is not a very bad perspective in general. AKA helping to clean cities of the ever ruining hordes of mass tourism. Many European cities have already implemented drastic measures for curbing down the number of visitors, others planning to do so in the nearest future, like 3 to 10 Euros daily tax for Venice visitors or blocking the access numbers in Dubrovnik etc., etc.Only in Budapest the number of newly opened hotels have risen threefold and tons of others follow suit. All that makes a terrible influx on environment (zillions of planes in the sky), heavy burden on infrastructure, sever price rises for locals and the least can go on forever.All in all while i general this ""little nasty"" virus is a terrible disaster, on the other side helps governments and local councils to resolve that problem without enormous additional costs. So as it always has been: ""For someone its a war, for someone it's his dear mother"".PS,Eva, by the time you will get your cheap train hotel fair, whole of France will be shut down for good. Well, at least you will have a chance to roam the totally deserted streets of Paris in complete solitude:)"

I also believe those who work for the Center for Disease Control, who are mostly been there for life. Anyone Trump appointed would voice the same opinion as Trump which is total ignorance."
"You are asking total strangers and quite a few of the Posters don't even live in Budapest, so their advice on current situation is of zero value.Only you can decide whether it is safe or not. Official news, government internet resources, live reports are your best friends today. Just forget rubbish type facebooks, twitters and other junk info giants.For the time being we don't have such severe measures like in the most hit countries, China, Italy, South Korea etc. But its just a matter of days, probably even hours. Neighboring countries started to introduce very strict rules, like Austria requires and allows to enter anyone coming from Italy having an official certificate of not being infected!!!Our government already have cancelled all the March 15th celebrations (this one is not so bad, because in the recent 10 years it has turned into a massive government supported propaganda rallies), people over 65 are strongly recommended not to go out, all the schools are recommended not to organize school trips or excursions. Many companies drastically reduced the ""rights"" of their employees, like no air travel, cancelled conferences, business trips, concerts (like Santana's for next week), sports events have been cancelled, etc., etc. Our main air carrier, Wizzair cancelled ALL the flights to Italy and Israel (Israel introduced a ""voluntary"" quarantine for all the incoming passengers) till April 3. Flixbus followed suit, no buses from Italy till April 3.Opposition in the Parliament strongly insists on closing all the schools. While the ruling majority usually sweeps away 99% of those requests or initiatives, this one definitely will be introduced soonest, like it has happened even in the very lightly hit Czech republic.The biggest challenge we are facing now is the return of thousands of Hungarians from Italy (our embassy ""sheepishly"" advised them doing this, AKA if some of them already having been infected, even being not aware of that fact, just bring your stuff over here) followed by hordes of migrant Ukrainian workers. Since whole of Italy has shut down, there is not much option left for those guys. For almost 90% of the Ukrainian and Romanian migrant workers the one and only way home is to drive through Hungary and there is still almost non existent control infection control at the border with Slovenia and South-Eastern borders with Austria.OOPS, just have received the excellent news that Slovenia has decided to shut its borders for people coming from Italy, only transportation of goods allowed!Even our would be puppet king OV said today at a special industry/commerce meeting, that this years tourist season has been definitely busted and everybody has to be ready to leave his own comfort zone! This person is among my top 10 list of persona non-gratas and he was probably the leader of that list back from 1989! Now I have to admit sadly that he is damn right.Yesterday I visited two hotels (one also is a main office of a partner company) and the other hotel for a cup of coffee. Both are centrally located and usually 80% booked almost all year long. When leaving talked a bit to the receptionists and both have sadly informed me of EVERY single day's coming cancellations (some were even for Christmas period!!!) and NO bookings in the nearest couple of months:))So much about tourism..."
Great and informative post Bela. Stay healthy.- Greyhound
"This is posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Budapest:“ March 10, 2020Country-Specific InformationHungary has twelve confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders.The Hungarian government has so far not imposed any trade bans or other restrictions as a result of COVID-19.The Hungarian government has asked its citizens not to any travel to infected areas.Budapest’s Liszt Ferenc airport reports that airport staff will measure the temperatures of arriving passengers of Iranian citizenship, as well as passengers arriving from Seoul, Northern Italy, and China.Entry and Exit RequirementsThe Hungarian government raised its travel warning to Hubei province in China to Level 1: Travel Not Recommended.Two Chinese carriers have temporarily suspended their direct routes between Hungary and mainland China. Starting February 7 until March 27, Hainan Airlines suspended its flights to Chongqing, and Shanghai Airlines to Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi’an. Air China has announced new limitations on the airline’s flights from Hungary to China. Wizz Air reported the cancellation of flights to Italy to mid-March.Quarantine InformationThere are individuals who have been quarantined in Hungary as precautionary measure due to the possibility they may be infected.The Hungarian government has stated that if such individuals remain symptom-free for more than two weeks they can be released."
"I have also booked trip for prague, vienna abda budapest at 6th may?"
I would add that I strongly believe the numbers are.so low in Hungary because they are not testing and are likely underreporting the numbers. Angela Merkel has said Germany should be prepared for 60% of German residents to catch the disease this year. I don't know why that wouldn't be true for all eu countries.
"** I don't know why that wouldn't be true for all eu countries **@cpfoutz: I agree and I believe you hit the nail right on the head.While the world is experiencing the advent of this outbreak and the medical community is grappling to delineate the COVID-19 virus, naturally, the politicians faced with Ad hoc decision-making based on statistics in their domicile.Perhaps, it is not a surprise that in the Pan European the reactions by the political leaders are varied at this moment, although I have a feeling that at some point, not so distant all EU countries will be in line with a unified decision.Australian researchers predicted that the deadly virus will take about 15 million lives when it hits nadir (read it on Yahoo). A few doctors in Iran just announced they discovered the cure against the Coronavirus and in 8 to 10 weeks it would be available in the market (I will believe it when I see it).In summary, as we go through this difficult odyssey, there will be cacophony of varied opposing voices before dust settles."
"Actually, predictions are 40-70% of the world population will catch the virus this year. As of now, all events over 100 people are cancelled. This includes clubs and bars over 100 people.The government has essentially declared martial law and is shutting down universities (online courses only), putting border control at Austria and Slovenia and not allowing anyone except Hungarian citizens from s. Korea, China, italy, iran."
"Chris,PLEASE DO NOT PANIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VÉSZHELYZET only means state of emergency.Martial Law means STATÁRIUM in Hungarian and involves the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions by a government, like curfews, food rationing, ban on movement of people etc., etc., which is NOT the current situation in Hungary.Martial law is a TOTALLY different situation!!!!!!! Even in the Wuhan province they have introduced only a very light form of that form of governance.In Hungary even the schools are not closed down for the moment.Edited: 9:42 am, March 11, 2020 "
"I posted this in a separate topic:Today a state of emergency was enacted in Hungary due to the Covid-19 epidemic.A comprehensive entry ban for travelling from Italy, Iran, S Korea, and China will be in force from tomorrow, 12 March at midnight (00:00 Central European time). This applies to citizens of any country coming from these four, except Hungarian citizens who will be subject to mandatory quarantine for 14 days.To enforce the entry ban, temporary border controls will be re-established on the intra-Schengen border of Hungary and Slovenia and Austria.Right now not every detail is clear, on the press briefing they told this does not apply to goods transport.Probably everything will be clearer for tomorrowRight now if you haven't been in these four countries there is no reason to be concerned. Restrictions may happen, as they did in other countries in Europe, such as cancellation of sport events, theatre shows etc.But there in NO martial law. Local legislation have 3 or 4 degrees of the state of emergency, this is the LOWEST possible one (martial law is the highest)"
Here is a summary in English from Hungarian press:https:/…
"PSAnd I simply LOVE the debilitating stupidity of our ""dear"" gov. decisions, like that government speaking trumpet's explanation of today's decision not closing down public schools:""The schoolchildren are not prone to this infection so there is no need to close the schools."" NO COMMENTS!!!"
The press release mentions that outdoors public events of over 500 people are banned - does this mean the Easter market will be cancelled?
HelloDo you know if the baths will still be open? What about museums and the ruin pubs?Thank you
"Closure of cinemas, theatres was explicitly mentionedIt was also mentioned that ""restaurants"" will stay open but ""clubs"" have to close the same way like cinemas or theatres. Would be interested too where will pubs or bars belongWe are now waiting for the government decree to flesh out the details (e.g. it was mentioned that they intend to cut air and rail links with the virus hot-spots but it is not clear whether trains between Hungary and Slovenia/Austria will be affected)Probably we will know more tomorrow..."
It will take a couple.of days to see how this plays out but let's just say if you are coming for a party Budapest isn't the place. Clubs and large ruin pubs will be limited to 100 and likely will at least partially close. Places like szimpla may get a pass because it is technically outdoors. Not a place I would risk though and I am pretty adventurous.
I think whole Europe is not a place for party now. Everywhere there is ban/limitation.
"I've got no interest in partying so that's not a worry :) I was hoping to visit the ruin pubs though, just for the experience, but mainly I'll be seeing landmarks and museums, the szechenyi baths and going to some nice restaurants (already reserved them). Hopefully I'll still be able to do most of that"
"Thank you for the update, very helpful. I'll be keeping a close eye on developments"
"I read now that two prominent ruin pubs/bars , Instant and Szimpla just announced that they are going to close indefinitely until the situation does not improve."
Facebook posts on both venues confirm this.Check Facebook for most up.to date information on any venue you may be looking at.
"School kids are absolutely a contagion vector in this epidemic, even if they ride it easily.Kids lick stuff, play with their snot, hard to install adult hygiene discipline in them. Witness how epidemics of mumps and measles used to spread before MMR. Also they are frequently in the care of their grandparents, the most vulnerable sector of the population. But closing schools has huge impact on industry as many parents need then to be off work to care for them.I applaud the sensible stuff Hungary is doing, even though it puts a huge damper on tourism. Here in the UK, pushing 500 cases and seeing the runes in Italy, Germany and France, nothing public has been closed down. A horse racing festival with daily crowds of over 60,000 is ongoing ... I don't fear for myself despite spending time in hospital on antibiotic drip with pneumonia last year, rather my 89 year old mum, because she is so active using buses to go into town, doing her own supermarket shopping, a frequent cinema and theatre attender through a support group she's involved with.Should she self isolate being in the most vulnerable group ?

"Hello,I was wondering about the flight connections between Budapest, Barcelona and Prague. Thank you"
"For the moment no disruption. But it seems the situation changes by the day or by the hour. Slovakia announced very severe lockdown measures (cut ALL international transport links), and the Czech premier mentioned that ""radical"" measures will be taken to curb the epidemic.Meanwhile the number of cases is increasing fast in Spain too. So it might be that flights between Budapest and Barcelona/Prague will be cut not because of Hungary but the measures of the destination country."
"From tomorrow on (07:00 local) , the Czech Republic and Slovakia canceled most or all of their international trains.Therefore all trains from Budapest to these two countries, and those to Germany and Poland which go through them, have been canceled as well.Have no info about flights yet."
"Czechia has banned all travellers from China, S Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, UK, Denmark, and France.So pretty much in shut down mode, bugger tourist industry and tens of thousands of people who rely on it to live. Wonder if it will have a better outcome than the UK, which for now is taking a relaxed approach, saving hard hitting measures until virus really starts ramping up. Danger with total containment is that when you stop measures background virus is still around, and will start infecting people all over again, until population immunity or vaccine halts it."
@Laura-Eva- well trump thinks because UK is not in Schengen and has closed boarders that Uk is safer. But then you have flights from all over coming into Heathrow and potentially carrying the virus. Trump also thinks his “wall” will keep the virus in mexico. So much for anything he says or his crdibility.
"US has already enough contagion to spread an epidemic.Viruses love air travel, rather than a slow boat. We can't kill them, just build up our resistance, a battle the human race has won over recorded history, with casualties we cannot accept in modern times."

From 16 March the Czech Republic enacted a total entry ban for foreign citizens. That definitely answers the question about flights from Budapest to Prague.
"We are supposed to be heading to Budapest from Vienna in a couple of days. I would be crazy disappointed if I cant visit (absolutely understand though) but is there going to be anything open. Here in Austria restaurants, shops, museums and even hotels are said to be closing Monday next week."

"Hi,There was some misunderstanding recently, but let's pretend you are talking about those 2-14 day river cruises to or from Budapest.I don't like to repeat yesterday's or even earlier posts or infos, like quite a few posters around here doing constantly (they probably have an urge to show up or simply don'r read other people's post) but now have to repeat that: ALL those river cruises have been cancelled till April 28!"
Thank you. I apologize for asking the same question as others.
Jet2 have cancelled all flights to Budapest as of now and will be flying customers home upto and including the 20th March.
"Devastated but probably for the best, I'll still be visiting as soon as we're able to. More time to practise my Hungarian I suppose"
That's it. Total entry ban for foreigners just announced (dont know about the details)So I assume you should cancel if your planned trip was in the next 2-4 weeks (nobody knows how long this can last)

"According to a Hungarian friend, it is being reported that the airport will close this evening. I will post as soon as I can find more information."
"Hi Rommel, from today, only Hungarian residents can pass the borders of Hungary in order to stop the spread of the virus. Approximately 30-40% of the restaurants and other tourism-related places are already closed, and as they have to close their doors at 3 pm, there will be far more that remain closed all day. Schools, pre-schools are closed, everybody who is capable has to work from home and isolate themselves from other people. We hope, it will be better in May when you will arrive, or even sooner. Please check the cancellation policy of the hotel you have booked, as they might be changed. Take care. Marta"
"Roman Citizen, Magyar Hírlap, today 20:15hrs reported Kovács Zoltán, minister for international communications saying that it is the borders which are closed but ""we are not closing the airport"".If you look on Flight Radar you can see that there was a pretty full list of departures tonight with normal punctuality. Tomorrow seems pretty normal too, with both El-Al and WizzAir running flights from Tel Aviv, and BA departures to London Heathrow. I'm guessing people using Budapest as a transfer hub will not be affected as long as they remain air-side. Its the airlines which will eventually close flights, so all the more urgency to make your journey ASAP."

"Hi, I wondered, is there a 14 day quarantine for arrivals from the UK (with a UK passport) at present? I was hoping to have a couple of days in Budapest en route to Sicily on 19th-22nd June but will go straight to Italy from the UK if so. ThanksEdited: 5:42 am, June 04, 2020 "
"https:/…entry-requirementsPersonally I think that it is unlikely that travel from and to the UK will get any easier before the end of August. Like her neighbours, Hungary has been very successful in limiting the impact of Covid-19 upon the nation's health - unlike the UK. They are not going to throw that away, they will wait until countries like the UK (and Sweden etc) show that they have the disease firmly under control before allowing people arriving from those countries to enter."
"Ok thanks, yes makes sense, I was probably being overly optimistic since I haven't been to Budapest before and was hopeful of ticking it off my list. Nevermind, I'll wait until later in the year.Edited: 8:26 am, June 04, 2020 "
