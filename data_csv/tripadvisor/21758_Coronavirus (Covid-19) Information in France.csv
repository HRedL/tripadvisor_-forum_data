"Hello Travelers, Tripadvisor has created this thread to be an ongoing resource for anyone seeking information about Coronavirus (Covid-19) and travel to France. Many travelers have already contributed to information about the Coronavirus, and we are hoping you will share any new updates or recommendations pertaining to Coronavirus in France here. Some of the information we’re seeing travelers seek out is: What attractions have been closed, or have re-opened for business?Are there any specific local resources for following news or other information? Have there been any significant disruptions to government services (such as public transport or airport/train stations)?What types of disruptions to local businesses have been noted?For more details on the situation globally please visit this Tripadvisor guide: https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019Additional threads with useful information that have already been started by our travelers can be found here:https://www.tripadvisor.com/Search…Please feel free to respond to this post with questions or information about this important issue, or share links to existing forum posts with useful information.

We already have several of these threads. Are you sure we need another one? The information is already spread out too far.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g20790…
I agree that there are already too many threads on this topic.What I find also strange is that two weeks ago I asked for my informative post to be pin on the Paris and the France forum. But it was only put up in the Paris forum : https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…And now this new one appears.
"Hello both, Thank you for taking your time to share links to the existing topics and for all of the information you have already posted.

Macron is having a press conference right now...close to 600 new cases in last 24 hours....
"Maybe some good news...If you go to the government website for: National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD, 20894 USA And do a search for: COVID-19 False-positiveYou find an article how testing for the virus produces false positive results as high as 80%.That's great news and perhaps why so many famous people and politicians testing positive are surviving.Here is the article:[Potential false-positive rate among the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' in close contacts of COVID-19 patients].Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been carrying out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives."
"What version of these many tests was this for? And where and when was this article published? Could you provide a link? My understanding is that there are also false negatives. My guess is that celebrities and politicians and people like Javier Solana are being tested multiple times. Certainly that was the standard of care in Wuhan, where a woung physician who ended up dying of Covid 19 tested positive then negative, before dying.  https:/…coronavirus-death-life.html"
"Just google the article text, the first result is the exact page on that Center for Biotechnology website.The most famous young doctor, Li Wenliang, has his own wiki page, he's known as a hero whistle-blower trying to save others lives with the real story during the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan:Li Wenliang (Chinese: 李文亮; pinyin: Lǐ Wénliàng; 12 October 1986 – 7 February 2020) was a Chinese ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital who on 30 December 2019 warned fellow colleagues about a possible outbreak of an illness that resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), later acknowledged as COVID-19, on WeChat. He became a whistleblower when his warnings were later shared publicly.[1][2] On 3 January 2020, Wuhan police summoned and admonished him for ""making false comments on the Internet"".[1][3] Li returned to work, later contracted the virus from an infected patient and died from the disease on 7 February 2020, at age 33.[4][5]"

Here is a TV news report from Bourdin Direct on the Marseilles institute with a virus cure drug trial actually treating COVID positive patients right now that are showing signs of improvement every day of treatment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOvNltz3ZmQCopy and paste the comments into TRANSLATE to see what the population thinks.
"Has there been any info posted by the French government stating that tourism companies do not have to give reimbursements, but can issue credit vouchers instead? We book a bike trip with RandoVélo for June but have tried to cancel (within there normal cancellation policy meaning we would get all back but 5% which we are ok with) and they are refusing to refund our money stating that the government is protecting them and does not require them to refund money for trips. We do not what other steps to take."
"travelbuggal_23, if the policy you are within their cancellation period is still valid after April 15th which is the current and latest extension date for the government controls then I would try a couple days after to cancel again. If the controls are extended again until April 30th then I would try again then to cancel. This is my humble opinion only."
The cancelation policy means we have to cancel before April 5th. Do you have any links to the government directive that has been referred to?
"I do not know of this verbiage your tour company is using to avoid giving you a refund. I think I vaguely understood a Macron speech at the start of these controls saying no one would be kicked out of rental properties for missing payments so maybe this statement was just the beginning of a longer sentence protecting businesses. Since then, my friends that have 2nd properties they have rented with yearly contracts to French citizens have taken advantage of this and have stopped paying their rents. Rent income my friends have depended on.Anyway, if they won't give you vouchers, nor rescheduling options, nor any refund money for cancelling then if it were me then I would not cancel since that would make any contract null & void. But that may be bad advice. But if it were me, I would try to continue to search for answers and also alternative ways of using or selling my booking so I would reopen a dialogue with them.However, I also believe it's a stretch but that is also only a belief which I do not know of any official website with the rules. Even if true, it's bad business. Sorry, not much help but at least I am not blaming the victim."

"How likely is travel in July to France? We have booked flights and apartments and arriving july 1st. So far our flights are not canceled. We purchased tickets through Justfly.com and they will not allow for a change to tickets for later travel until a travel advisory is issued, however, it states on travel.gov ""do not travel"". I know that no one can predict the future, however, any input would be appreciated."
"@16 No crystal ball here but we have a trip planned for arrival July 1 and just today made my first contact to cancel a guide in Provence. He had a deposit and had no problem refunding...in fact it seems that more or less they expect few if any tourists this summer. From my perspective way too much uncertainty as to when travel will be fun and comfortable again...probably not this summer. The airlines are moving week by week in their travel waiver and will wait on that. It is not fun deconstructing a trip that you put together and were looking forward to but just the reality this year.You might check with your apartment etc. and see what their policies are given the circumstances. Good luck.Edited: 7:32 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"> any links to the government directive that has been referred to?on service-public.fr :https:/…A13965the usual Code du tourisme has been void by the government, and that link summarizes what you can expect. Only chance to get entitled a refund is if you booked a ""voyage à forfait"" directly from a french based operator. With a RandoVélo tour it may be the case. they are french company located in France and the product they sell is a combo transportation+accomodation, but then the ""transportation"" point is what needs to be checked, like if it's about tickets to/from or if the bicycle rides do fall in the category. And well too, how it was sold to you, the whole ""forfait"" label...you may need a french lawyer to actually make sense of the temporary directive relatively to what you bought and to start a legal claim in France..."
"Barbara P, wait for the Macron speech Monday night to plot a graph of where the government's head is at. Mainstream seems to be back-pedalling on the numbers of what constitutes an actual covid statistic so that might influence the direction. The latest extension is about to expire also which is obviously showing signs of fatigue. Let's see what this weekend brings too. Tic toc"
Thank you. I will patiently wait to see the direction the government takes.
"Sounds like you are in the same boat as us. It's a waiting game which is tough. Hopefully, we will know more next week."
Now our Spain /U.K. ferry in May has been cancelled and we have to drive through Spain and France to Calais to travel through the Eurotunnel. Does anyone know if any hotels are open in France for travellers.
Wasnt there a press conference today about the plan to reopen France? Do we have date yet for when cafes and such will reopen?
"The French government announced this afternoon that any person that enters France must go into mandatory quarantine, till July 24, although this date could still change."
May 11 things will start to reopen with guidelines and certain area restrictions. For the French the priority seems to be hairdressers and barbershops. Bakeries have been open since the beginning. Cafés are near the last on the priority so ask again in June.
HiI have a flight from Middle East to Canada in July and have very long stopover in Paris. Does anyone know if it is now possible for international travellers to leave the airport and spend the night at a hotel to catch the flight the next day? Or the current travel restrictions do not allow that??Would really appreciate a response
"No official announcement from France but it seems several EU and Schengen countries are pointing at allowing tourists from other EU/Schengen countries to enter.This is what the PM was quoted as saying:European Union Nationals may soon be eligible to enter France, as the country is planning to open its borders on June 15, given that the situation does not worsen in the meantime.The possibility of opening the borders for non-essential purposes to all EU and Schengen citizens was presented by the French Prime Minister Éduoard Philippe during a press conference on phase 2 of the containment exit plan of the country“Some European countries chose to reopen their borders before others, and I respect that decision…We take our decisions at our own pace, and we believe that the right time to access our territory is June 15,” Prime Minister Philippe said during the conference, referring to some countries as the Baltic States, which have already opened their borders for a limited number of EU nationals.According to the French Primer, the quarantine will not be obligatory for travellers from EU; however, such a measure can be imposed in a reciprocity move to the nationals of countries that require French citizens to go through quarantine of present negative COVID-19 test results.“France will be for the reopening of EU inner borders, starting from June 15, if the health situation allows it, of course, without two-week self-isolation for travellers coming from a European country. We will apply reciprocity measures towards EU countries who would decide to close their borders or impose two-week quarantines to French people,” the PM said.https:/…No word yet on tourists from countries outside the EU/Schengen."
So the EU seems to be heading in the direction of opening up to the outside world this summer:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…
"@29 not so sure that ""outside world "" includes the US!"
"True, a lot of things have already changed since last week and it could change more before July."
"Hello, I have the Eurostar booked for 15th of June , London to Lyon. My trip is unfortunately not for pleasure. I am just wondering what the government deem as a family emergency? My father lives there and needs my help.Edited: 7:00 am, June 06, 2020 "
I still cant find the current status for travel to France from USA. Does anyone know?
"#33, I believe you haven’t found anything because there is no current plan yet for US citizens to be allowed in. It’s still unfolding for EU members and other European (non-EU) countries. Perhaps there will be more information on June 15, but it seems that France is, understandably, opening slowly."
So USA citizens currently not allowed? Even the embassys website is vague.
"toddhart, Correct. As of now, no US citizens are allowed to enter France, unless it’s for “essential” travel - not tourism.As of now, France will first be opening it’s borders to countries within the EU and then other European countries. So far, there is little or no mention as to when the borders will be open to people from the US.Also, remember there is still a Level 4 Global Health advisory in place, which advises US citizens to,avoid all international travel due to covid.Edited: 9:37 pm, June 09, 2020 "
"An EU body says EU to open to external tourists from July 1.Confusing because several member states have said they would use their own lists and criteria to determine which tourists from countries outside Schengen will be allowed to enter.https:/…But if some countries allow tourists from outside the EU to enter, then presumably with internal border restrictions lifted, those outside tourists could go anywhere within Schengen/EU?"
"Hi, I want to buy a ticket from Helsinki to Paris arriving on 28th of June and I’m still wondering If I should purchase now because I think the tickets are getting more and more expensive. I want to visit my girlfriend and we are in a LDR so I really hope it will work out. I’m scared to not able to go after buying the tickets but also I’m afraid to have to pay a lot for the plane tickets :( I wonder If it is sure that we can travel from Helsinki to Paris after June 15th?"
Latest news about France opening borders for EU countries starting from 15/6: https:/…amp
"@39 THANKS for that link. My take away for complete certainty will be ""French president Emmanuel Macron is expected to clarify the situation in his speech to the nation on Sunday evening."" I have a small hotel who is waiting for that statement to be sure that the new bookings they are now taking from EU guests will be allowed to come. If so they should then be ready to refund my deposit since my room has been sold again and I can't come."
"#37“ But if some countries allow tourists from outside the EU to enter, then presumably with internal border restrictions lifted, those outside tourists could go anywhere within Schengen/EU?”Of course, rules change faster than a speeding bullet, but I believe that travel restrictions are determined by place of origin."
"Macron announced first steps for easing restrictions from the pandemic:The French president announced in the speech that:- Starting tomorrow, June 15, all of mainland France will be classified as a “green zone” with regard to Covid-19 risk. Virtually all lockdown restrictions will be lifted, allowing bars and restaurants to open again, notably in the Paris region, where their operations have been restricted.- Overseas territories Mayotte and French Guaiana will remain classified as “orange” zones- All schools and nurseries will be able to reopen as of Monday, June 22- Nursing home visits will once again be allowed- Large gatherings will remain restricted- He will make another speech in July outlining longer-term policy responses to the Covid-19 crisishttps://www.france24.com/en/20200614-live-fr…German site shows map tracking last 7-day averages of new cases:https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuart…"
"Can you visit France if you are not a residence ? We have Uk passports., and second home in France"
Yes You can now. Though I think there will be 2 weeks quarantine.
"Yes you can now visit, there is a 14 day VOLUNTARY quarantine in France where they suggest you self isolate on arrival but it is not compulsory.When returning to the UK currently you will have mandatory 14 day quarantine with a fine of £1000 if you are caught away from home.I am visiting our 2nd home in France on Monday, never stayed away so long and cannot wait!"
I hate to say voluntary quarantine is a joke; either there is or there isn't!
I’ve vlogged about our attempts to get back to France from the UK and what happened. You can watch them here: https://youtu.be/f26WI54vzjc
"The request for quarantine is real, but in France you cannot forcibly restrict the freedom of movement of a person without a judge's ruling, so it's not possible to put someone in isolation against their will. So this is based on the self-responsability of the person (which is very obviously a big leap of faith :( )."
Hi Can an EU citizen still not fly Paris to Guadeloupe freely?
"Are there any reports on how much tourist activity there is since the country opened its borders a week or two ago?Are the hotels and restaurants full, half-full, less than half full still?Are the popular tourist venues or the trains as busy or nearly as busy as they would normally be?For instance, there was a report that on the first day Spain opened its borders earlier this week, 100 planes arrived (not all international). Don't know how that compares to the number of flights which would normally arrive there this time of the year."
"There should be some reports, for English, try the local.frIn real time I've been seeing quite an active local scene. I was in Chartres the other day and the cafés around the cathedral were closer to empty than full. But the big square for locals was buzzing. My local main street hotel is still closed which is normally full.Some borders are open, opening,.. but people appear cautious staying in familiar surroundings, family homes, or isolated locations.Outdoor seating at restaurants is saving some sense of economy, bars in my town all have free street terrace seating and they're full of French people."
"OTOH, I read another account that beaches in Nice were full and so were the restaurants and cafes.Nobody wearing masks or keeping distance."
"Hi, can anyone let know if a US citizen is currently allowed to enter France?My impression from a couple of French government websites is that a US citizen would NOT be allowed to enter France, but if someone can stay with certainty this is the case, I’d appreciate it.Thanks"

"HI,Please could anyone advise on the following - i'm getting confusing information and the gov. website is as clear as mud, with conflicting messages on essential travel and self isolation.a) Once we have arrived in France from the UK via euro tunnel, can we travel by car to various locations down the west coast, staying in 4 or 5 different towns or are we required to stay in one place?b) do we need to complete any online declaration before we leave the UK? c) How welcoming are the French people during this difficult time?

"Hi there.We are very confused too. Hoping to travel to the Vendee in August but not sure what to expect regarding restictions, quarantine on arrival etc. We have heard that lockdowns can be regional and happenfast if there is an regional outbreak of Covid 19 - is this true?

"Bonjour, Daniel,I looked for information, but could not find anything definite. It is possible that holders of a Hungary passport may enter France only under certain conditions, as listed in the declaration. This means that tourism is not a qualifying condition. Please check with a local embassy or even an airline representative to verity this information. Good luck and please return to say whether or not you were able to travel to Nice.MrsJAS"
"Hungary is in Schengen and in theory you can now enter France freely : https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/FRAThe document you are listing is for entry in a French oversea territory (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Réunion, Guyane...), not for mainland France where Nice is located. So that document is twice not relevant to your trip. See here the official French information : https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-a… (in English a bit down the page). The recommended document for trips to mainland France (""France metropolitaine"") is here : https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/content/downlo… but it's clearly written that it's not be filled by visitors from EU state members."

"Hi FolksI'm hoping someone will be able to help with this. I was due to go to Paris on May 13th to 18th. With Covid19 that didn't happen. I tried to arrange a change of dates with the hotel but they aren't responding to any contact. I've tried ringing them, emailing them and using their 'contact us' webform. But no reply. I'm attempting to arrange a credit card charge back with BOI. In lieu of a confirmation from the hotel that they could not supply the service, someone from BOI suggested I send confirmation from Aer Lingus that the flight was cancelled (which I have) and some official notice from the French government confirming they weren't allowing in tourists or they were but with restrictions. I've googled this but can only find news reports. I'm hoping someone who maybe speaks French could point me towards any such government announcement. I'd be very grateful if any one can help with this. Again the dates were 13th to 18th May.Kind regards."

"Hellohttps://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/soins-et-m…Above is the official French ministry of health advice as at 20th July. you can copy and paste into google translate for full text. This is the answer to your 2 questions:The wearing of face masks applies to anyone aged 11 years old and aboveThe regulation is pretty specific about the type of mask so with a bandana you might be refused entrance to enclosed public places.The mask can be a disposable medical face mask. The French government has placed a price cap of 95 cents per maskOr a reusable 3 layers fabric ""Masque grand public"" that complies with the AFNOR NFEN14683 (equivalent to British standard) widely available in supermarkets from 2.5 euros. these have to be washed at 60 degrees after each use.From what I understand a mask is to be worn everywhere except the street, the open countryside and the beachA fine of 135 euros can be incurred for not wearing the maskHope this helps"
"Hi, I have a question I have been unable to find the answer to, but I do apologize if I've missed a prior post during my search. I'm an American visiting my partner in the UK while I'm between jobs. I completed the appropriate two week quarantine last week. We are planning to take a trip together and, given the amount of time we've both spent in the UK over the past year, were wondering if France would be possible for a cycling trip. She is a UK citizen and resident (back home to get a graduate degree), so she should not be an issue. Some people have intimated that I might be allowed in given that I have quarantined in an approved country, but this seems a bit sketchy to me as it would seem to make the non-approved restrictions quite porous. I am not looking to break any rules/laws. To be clear/sum up, I am an American citizen and resident, have completed the quarantine in the UK, and of course would follow any local guidelines/laws on PPE.Has anyone in a similar situation succeeded or failed or have any links to appropriate rules?

Thank you so much.
We are travelling to France on Sunday via Eurotunnel and understand no forms to fill in - we are confused about the return to UK form on GOV.UK website as states cannot be completed more than 48 hours in advance and we do not have internet access etc at our place in France. Has anyone recently travelled back to UK from France who can advise please.Thanks in advance!
"HiWe came back on Sunday and you must fill the form in before you arrive at the tunnel to check in, you can do this on your mobile phone on the way which we did and once it is filled in they send you an email with a reference number which you show at passport control.Good luck"
Thanks for sharing your experience. There's a lot of information online and it gets confusing. My son is going to use the tunnel next week and I wanted to make sure how it works. Your message was in the right time and place. Lucky me.
"Hello everyone. Apologies if this has been answered already. Are there any tests or quarantine measures in place at Paris airports for EU citizens wanting to visit Paris? Croatians in particular. Tourist purposes.Any form that has to be filled in prior to flying?According to some websites I found, there are no restrictions of any kind neither forms to be filled for EU people.Edited: 5:57 pm, July 30, 2020 "

"Hello, I'm sorry if this has been asked before, but I'm on a short leash (I'll be leaving on saturday) and I don't know what to expect.What is exactly the current restrictions situation in France? Because judging by the titles it appears France is on the verge of a lockdown (and I'm afraid it will be, sooner or later, like any other - european - country), but digging deeper in local news it seems that things are smoother than presented. Is it only Nice which is going to mandate masks in outdoor places (and other smaller towns - whose name I'd like to know)? Is it true that these measures are in effect til Friday 8th? Are there strong chances they're likely to be extended?I'm in fact going to Nice first, then countinue eastbound.Personal note:it makes me laugh that statements say these measures are implemented ""to protect tourism"", what do they think they will make to tourists' opinion?Edited: 10:24 pm, August 05, 2020 "

Can anybody comment on the viability of US citizens, not resident in the US , successfully gaining entry into France in particular? The French embassy has told us, via e-mail, that it is up to the border authorities on a day-to-day basis but that's not concrete enough to schedule flights, hotels,etc. Thanks!"
"I understand that to enter France you have to be tested and have results of a negative COVID PCR test no less than 72 hours old. With the long lag times for test results, this seems like a tight window. Has anyone had any experience with this ?Edited: 6:48 pm, August 15, 2020 "
I have been told you cannot board without the results. It has to be a PCR test but rapid results are not accepted.
St Tropez requires masks to be worn.
Sounds like masks are required even outdoors in many cities.Police are telling people out of courtesy but fines are also possible.
