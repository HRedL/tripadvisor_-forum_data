Anyone know if any cases in Menorca yet?
Yes one a physician from Mateu Orfila hospital who is progressing well and another 71 year old one who was in a Ciutadella hotel and had come from Madrid and is in a grave condition. There are several suspected cases as neither had followed protocol of phoning 061. One went to A & E and the other to a health centre. More info can be found by checking www.menorca.info daily for up to date situation.

"I live here on Menorca permanently and confirm that the media are reporting exactly the situation that dettorifan has outlined. Unfortunately, the fact that the authorities have not quarantined the hotel where the tourist who came from Madrid was staying, or prevented his travelling companions from moving freely around the island is not encouraging. There was a previous discussion thread on this forum, but it was removed. I don’t know why. I will provide only factual updated information on this new thread if it is of interest to people. However, if not, perhaps those people who objected to the previous thread will let me know and I will desist. Cheers."
"Thanks, I suspected there would be case or two as its pretty much spread to the entire world now. We are over beginning of April Apartment hunting again"
Antarctica is free of Coronavirus if that’s any use to you ?
DiggerCardiff Not quite true. A penguin was tested but once they unwrapped it the penguin was found not to have the virus but was covered in chocolate as a precaution
"Agree QS , would rather trust your reports than some of the stuff we’re reading here"
"I would like you to keep people updated,im over in august for the 18th time and unless the government says no,i will be over with no worries"
"Yes please, Qualityspy, I’d appreciate updates.We’ve booked for July and it’s getting worrying now."
dufferI cannot see why you are worrying yet as who knows what the situation will be like in JulyI should point out that there is a case today at the hospital in Aintree ( your neck of the woods) so personally that would concern me more
I was watching the chief medical officer on the news tonight and he said to expect the spread of the virus to peak in the summer. That’s worrying
I agree QS. Speculation is not helpful. Better to take it case by case basis and on current advice. Thanks for the updates.
"There are apparently two cases in Menorca. One is reported to be a tourist from Madrid staying in Ciutadella, who is now in isolation in the hospital in Mahon. His wife has also been isolated as a precaution. There are 11 cases altogether in the Balearics. Posted 1935 10th March."
We are due to come in 2 weeks so please keep us posted.
Keep safe Qualityspy1

"I am assuming that these are probably more infected spanish tourists visiting the island under the ""Immerso"" scheme :-("
If they are being cared for at home doubt they were from Imserso programme but obviously had some link to Madrid.
"True - I worded that badly - I meant that the ""Madrid connection"" mentioned by QS1 probably suggests contact with an ""Immerso scheme"" tourist from the mainland . I could be completely wrong of course but...…..Edited: 7:50 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Despite the small numbee of cases in the Balearics we have cancelled our proposed Easter visit due to our age and underlying health conditions and the difficulty in finding adequate insurance. Menorca reports a 30% cancellation of bookings and the knock on effects of this are that hotel chains are looking to consolidate bookings. Without the buffer of Imserso for at least the bext month there are also plans to delay the start of the season to mid May so those with early holidays booked may have to accept there might be changes.Edited: 8:31 am, March 11, 2020 "
That is not good news. I am due to travel out on 2 June (self catering) and am still hoping that things will have calmed down by then but who knows...…….Thankfully I am on a flights and accom only package through Love Holidays so have ATOL & ABTA protection - I normally book direct with EasyJet & the apartment complex and only did it via Love holidays because I found a really good price in their New Year's Eve sale
I thinks it's swings and roundabouts really. Booking will Atol and Abta protection is great under normal circumstances and if you cancel with a valid reason. Booking direct or through an agency with free cancellation allows you to hedge your bets by booking more than one accommodation or change your mind and cancel without having a reason. The downside to that is you would lose your flight which unless they are cheap you may not want to do. In 58 years have only cancelled twice and have had airlines go bust three times! Let's hope our later visit comes off!
"Was thinking of booking a 4 night break this evening from the 11th of may ,don't normally do this but will be booking through On The Beach Agents, just gives us peace of mind if anything gets cancelled ,but unsure what to do now."
"Statement this afternoon, published in El Pais.“ Under ideal circumstances, if all of the measures being taken to control the spread of coronavirus work perfectly in Spain, the Health Ministry believes that the Covid-19 epidemic could come to an end in the country in two months. But this outcome is so idyllic that the experts consider it to be highly unlikely. “In the worst case, it could last four or five months,” said Fernando Simón, the director of the Health Ministry’s Coordination Center for Health Alerts and Emergencies. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Simón confirmed the latest number of confirmed infections in Spain at 2,109, and the number of deaths at 49.”This doesn’t mean cancel your holiday, but it is information to help you plan ahead, especially if you are coming via Madrid or Barcelona."
"insurance companies are adding extra insurance regarding virus , if already sorted insurance speak to your company , mine was when renewing annual , but was able to add on to daughters single trip policy"
"It was my post that got deleted, after extensive contact with TA it appears that my account was ghosted and alot of my posts got deleted.Its funny that I sort of predicted this but the so called experts flamed me, gotta wonder how that was coincidental?????"
"Are you suggesting that the Destination Experts removed your posts and were responsible for ""ghosting"" your account Gerard? If so you credit us with more power than we possess - DEs do not have the power to close down threads at will - the TA moderators do that - any member can report a thread to the moderators but they are the ones who review it"
"Good news, no new cases on Menorca today. From Monday next, all schools across the Balearics are to close. All public meetings, shows, sports etc are either not taking place or will be played behind closed doors for a month. So, nothing unexpected as the total number of cases across Spain as a whole has risen to over 3000, with all communities except the two enclaves in Northern Africa affected."
"Thanks for update ,"
That is a good way of limiting spread IMO . Hopefully the cases that have been discovered already will have not infected too many others
The bigger question is have they said about plans for the start of the tourist influx from April when the Easter holidays start.That's when there will be a greater risk surely of the numbers increasing on the island.
I found this forum really interesting about Menorca and the Coronavirus . We We are due to come to Menorca in May for a month as we usually do but feel it may be a bit foolish to do so with everything that is going on. Particularly as my husband has health issues.We stand to lose our flight money unless flights get banned so will keep checking the situation.
"ValBee9 - we have cancelled and are in the same boat and although have not lost money on accommodation we too will lose flight money unless flights are cancelled or airport closed. That is still a possibility and we shall have to watch the situation as it develops. Your doctor is the best person to advise on your particular medical risk. Nobody on this forum can or should attempt to advise you on that aspect.Edited: 6:30 pm, March 12, 2020 "
EasyJet are making changes to their cancellation policy as from tomorrow which may be of benefit to some people. So far as I can see terms and conditions with Jet2 remain as before.
I’ve rung Jet 2 and they’ve said I can put my deposit already paid onto a holiday for next year.
"That is interesting Dettorifan . My upcoming ""Love Holidays"" package trip in June has EasyJet flights in it -I will keep watching the situation as I have no intention of cancelling at this stage because would be gutted to not go"
"Alison -That sounds like a holiday deposit as flight only are paid in full at time of booking.Edited: 4:35 am, March 13, 2020 "
Yes that is correct
3 cases confirmed
"HiThat's interesting, we are booked flight only in May and have paid in full so maybe we can get in touch after reading your email. That gives me a bit of hope."
Due to fly out on may 2nd for 2 weeks. Fingers crossed!
"Alison P, did you have to pay any admin fees regarding the change? I've just read on Jet2's facebook page that someone has tried to change holidays but are facing difficulties. I am seriously thinking of changing mine too and transfer deposit for a 2021 holiday, waiting to see what things are like come this July and booking last minute. I don't fancy getting to Menorca, then taking ill there, or not be able to get back easily. I dont have our travel insurance yet (I know, stupid), as I was holding off til after the Brexit confusion so dont know where we would stand now re. Corona virus."
"Brief update following today’s press conference. There are still only three cases here on Menorca, but another five new cases today on Mallorca. The measures outlined below will remain in force for the next 15 days.The President of the Government, Francina Armengol, details at this time in a press conference that clubs, 'pubs', bingo halls and betting halls, sports centers and gyms must close, in addition to reducing to a third the expected capacity of all cinemas, restaurants and bars , to prevent the disease from advancing."
"All paid up for 2 weeks AI for 3!, so all we can do is wait , would be hard to change to any other holiday destination as we need full disabled facilities.fingers crossed it won’t come to that ."
"Have a look at the advice given by Martin Lewis on Tv this week https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlan…https:/… is worth a glance tooEdited: 12:30 pm, March 13, 2020 "
",,,just a reminder when posting / reading . It should be x CONFIRMED cases, which does not mean only x cases of infected people ( just tested people ). There may well be others infected. Like Detorrifan I think about how additional people may cause stresses/illness into the local population/health system resources"
"Thank you Tom. We do seem to have a problem when it comes to verified figures (even when very small). The island’s health authority is stating three confirmed cases here undergoing treatment currently and responding well. However, at the very top of the online Menorca paper it quotes just two case here. rtve.es give rolling updates on numbers by autonomous community and states 30 across the Balearic Islands, whereas the local government states 26. In any event, here on Menorca it really does seem that people are either staying at home to see what happens, or venturing to the supermarkets to stockpile. Seems the same throughout Europe from the messages I’ve received. One of our regular contributors has noted that custard creams have disappeared as well as the usual loo rolls etc! Strange times."
"Very odd - perhaps somewhere someone has suggested that custard creams some sort of antiviral properties ! I am sorry that you are stuck there in the middle of it . I know that you have lived on the island for some years but are the locals starting to close ranks and pull back from the ex-pats at all? Things are definitely getting very serious all over Spain aren't they - at my weekly spanish class today, one of my friends whose British son has lived and worked in Valencia for over 20 years told me that she has just been told by him that the he Valencian Regional Government,(on instruction of the Ministry of Health) has agreed to postpone the celebration of Las Fallas this month . The decision to cancel the main events of the annual Las Fallas fiesta is a huge thing for the Valencians - I am told that this is the first time it has been cancelled since General Franco was in power!Edited: 2:45 pm, March 13, 2020 "
No custard creams in torbay either.. but there is also a lack of everything else too. We are still hoping to get there in August. But flights are horrendous prices at present over £300 ea with EJ. Not sure with collapse of Flybe if Exeter can afford to stay open either. As we have a villa booked we are not worried too much as we can keep ourselves to ourselves. Only issue will be flights being cancelled. Are the Baleric government asking for full details of every one arriving. A friend went to Morrocco last week and had to complete a form which included questions re other travel and also which seat in the plane they were sat in on arrival. Return journey to LGW nothing checked or details taken.
"This evening the president of menorca island council, has applied to the central government asking to close the airport and both cuitadella and mahon ports during the 15 day lock down.It must be said that this request has not been accepted at this time, but I merely inform you, especially if anyone has travel plans to or from menorca during the next 15days"

"Thank You for the information Derek B. There are many regular visitors to Menorca who are very worried about the situation facing Menorcan residents current situation and send our best wishes to you all@ skimad - Post 57 wasn't really appropriate was it . we already know that people in mainland Spain are in lockdown in several areas and that the death toll is rising - you have no idea who might use this forum who has family members or friends who are high risk for serious complications if they contract the virus and they will probably find your comment upsettingEdited: 4:29 am, March 14, 2020 "

"All cool. I started a new thread purely to give current info that is relevant to immediate travel plans to the island. This thread is still useful for people to look further ahead and share thoughts, concerns and anything else. All stay well. Cheers, Ruth."
The custard creams scenario was me ...bizarrely that day the huge Sainsburys near us had 6 packets of biscuits (own brand digestives) in the entire biscuit aisle. All is well as this morning I’ve discovered Tesco’s have rhubarb and custard flavour ones! Keep safe everyone. I’m so sad reading about our beloved Menorca.☹️
It developed from your post - not because of it. The removed post was a flippant and somewhat inappropriate in response to Post 56) but no harm has been done honestly so please do not worry about it !
Same to you on hols!
"No, nothing at all"
"I just want to wish well for all the locals, both for their jobs and health, a holiday is just a holiday, yes we may lose money, yes we may be unhappy about it but at the end of the day its people we are talking about.Stay safe and healthy our self indulgent holidays will wait."
"We are due to fly from London to Menorca next Saturday, 21st with our children. We have flights with EasyJet and an Airbnb booking. Not sure what to do yet... it is advised to travel only if necessary, but I don’t want to loose the money we paid!!!!"
"Good morning Jenny. The UK foreign office are now advising against travel to anywhere in Spain, which includes the islands. EasyJet along with other airlines have suspended flights. From 8am tomorrow the whole of Spain is in lockdown for two weeks. Only essential journeys, for example to buy food and medicines are allowed. This is being enforced by the police. There are no shops, bars or restaurants open. Believe me, you would not want to come here now, even if you could. You will need to contact your insurance company about a refund for accommodation and EasyJet for your flights."
Yes 3 confirmed
"Hi perhaps read the next entitled Covid-19 Menorca which I update every day, using the info that we are being given by the health authorities which cover all three islands."
You have to take the dogs out one by one?
"Oh bestcornishcat, that’s a brilliant idea! I haven’t a clue about what that taking dogs out one by one means? Think Mr Google translate had a head fit there!"
Re one by one. Basically two people or more cant walk one dog. Considering they are probably from the same household cant see the point in that one. Ruth you can go to a pet store (according to the rules). So go get a harness and take it turns to take fluffy for a walk.
What are the chances of our holiday on may 16 th ??thanks mark
"Hi. No one can say for sure really. Even if Spain has turned the corner by then, the UK might be in lockdown. You have nothing to gain by cancelling now if you have a package booked. If you are doing a DIY holiday and have free cancellation options, then think carefully. The media here are suggesting that even if restrictions lift, it will be June before things start to return to normal."
What is the latest coronavirus situation in Menorca?
"Hi. The island has 47 cases as of now, but more are expected as some residents in a retirement home have been identified as probable cases. 8 people are in ICU. The only people being tested are those who are very severely ill, so the numbers mean nothing.The lockdown is being enforced by the police and civil guard. There are checkpoints to stop cars to check why and where people are travelling. Food supplies are being maintained, but with vastly reduced choice, but that’s ok.The hardest thing is not being allowed out to exercise. For families in flats with only a small balcony it is hell. As the figures across Spain and the islands are still on the upward trajectory, my guess is that the emergency lockdown will continue beyond the 12 April date. Better times will return one day."
"Hoping for better times QS and the time when we can return to visit our favourite Island , keep safe and keep posting, updates, thinking of you all."

I have read that hotel sur menorca is going to be used for patients with mild symptoms. I did mention to hubby the other day as I live in Torquay that there are many empty hotels all of which have an suites. That these would make idea isolation rooms with meals delivered from the kitchen. Or even For key workers so that they don't have to return home and give it family who may still be out and about shopping.
"Anch'io ho prenotato per il mese di maggio ma purtroppo ho annullato tutto, voli e hotel in quanto non sara' per tutti una ripresa veloce."
"grazie, temo che tu abbia ragione e ci vorranno molti, molti mesi. If possible could you post in English language on this site as it is the uk version of Trip Advisor rather than the .it version? . Cio!"
"Amanda H ,that is a very good suggestion hope this will happen at some point, All around the country should follow suit too."
That is an excellent idea - anything that helps the medics deal with this nightmare is worth considering
"Thanks for info, stay safe"
"Apparently there are contingency plans for the use of the Artiem Rey Carlos as well. In Mallorca they are using hotels for health workers but not considered necessary in Menirca. I am told by doctor today at Mateu Orfila that they are currently coping. He got stopped by police in his car today for taking his uncle to the supermarket in the car without him sitting behind. Don't know if this is a rule here but I haven't heard of it.Edited: 10:40 am, April 04, 2020 "
"Hi all. Yes, if you have to take someone in your car for a medical appointment they must sit in the back seat. Two people cannot be in a car for any other reason. I think he got off lightly due to being a medic as normally the police are not allowing a driver to take another person shopping. Their reasoning is that the driver should do the shopping and deliver it to the older/ vulnerable person’s home. Ditto farmacia."
Any updateWe are due to go to Menorca in October not sure how likely this is?
"Great news, ill leave it a few more weeks before we book flights ,see how things go first ."
"Up to now it's looking more hopeful for us to go to Menorca this summer but unless the rules change you will have to self isolate for 14 days on return to UK or face a £1000 fine. May be okay for retirees but not everyone.Edited: 12:51 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"As far as I know Menorca is free of the Virus, the last I heard was there were 3 cases in the Islands. The big issue here is people bringing the virus in. I believe the tourists will be allowed to return from June 15, Germans only. General tourism will return on July 1st. The problem is this apply to UK visitors, the big unknown."
Hi. Just to confirm. There have been no new cases on Menorca for 34 consecutive days now. Nor are there any people in hospital or under the care of community health services with the virus. The risk now is imported cases as freedom of movement between the islands has begun.
"I have just noticed that the FCO have now issued a major change to their travel advice - https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice currently only says ""...The Foreign & Commonwealth Office currently advises British nationals against all but essential international travel. This advice is being kept under constant review. …"" and is no longer talking about avoiding non essential travel and returning home urgentlyHas anyone seen anything recently about how the vaccine development is coming along?"
Menorcaregular that’s always been the advice hasn’t it? Avoid all but essential travel? Re the vaccine I believe they are close but issue is with testing it’s efficiency reliably due to lockdown...even if something was rolled out in September I’m guessing it would be given in priority order ie elderly and vulnerable first. I think it would take a while for everyone to get it.
It used to say more than it does now - stuff like advising those abroad to return home etc - it is a lot more watered down now TBH
Ah ok. I assume they think everyone who needed to come home already has! I hope they remove it altogether soon!
"Hi all,We have just had confirmed that our family holiday (6 of us) is going ahead as planned at the end of July, hows Menorca looking so far?"
Is Jordi's still there? I normally avoid anything vaguely akin to a burger joint but we had a couple of snack type lunches there last summer (they do things other than burgers) and the food was very nice
"Hi. yes, Jordis is still there and open."
"Last year it seemed very popular with young Spaniards. I was told that it was connected to Ca Na Marga in Ses Salines but I do not know if that is correct or not - perhaps Dogdad or one of his son's might knowEdited: 4:57 am, July 06, 2020 "
