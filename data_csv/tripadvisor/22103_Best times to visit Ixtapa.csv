We are having to reschedule our Ixtapa for Spring Break ( end of March) d/t COVID-19. Thinking about the Fall of this year. How is the weather in October or November? Are those good times to go? I think it's the tail end of the rainy season and wondering if the humidity is still too high.
Best kept secret is that November is probably one of the best times.
"We have gone at the end of October the last 5 years, can be a little hot but itâ€™s great pool weather and no crowds. When our son was younger we used to go over Thanksgiving and the weather was perfect, more people but not too bad at all."
"I love late November to mid December.Everything is fresh and clean in town, all the restaurants, shops, and bars are open and gearing up for the high season. Not many tourists yet. And the rains have stopped but the weather is great. The ocean is warm and the hillsides are lush and green still as opposed to the dead grey-brown of later winter.Edited: 9:46 am, March 18, 2020 "
"End of October for us every year.Love it then, everything is green green green!Keith"
After the Coronavirus becomes history.
