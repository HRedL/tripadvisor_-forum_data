"This morning at the Calle 38 beach, I watched police place yellow tape across the beach access.Here's a report from Por Esto...https://translate.google.com/translate…"
Someone staying at grand Hyatt posted a letter from management notifying guests of beach closure :(.
Youve gotta be kidding me man just my luck i arrive on tuesday. Is this only going to be for a week or an extended period of time
If I was a betting man I would guess an extended period of time.
My guess is an extended period.
It will depend on where you are staying if you are at a beach front resort it sounds like some resorts will grant you access in the case of the Grand Hyatt they are not it appears but not the case with all resorts. If you are not at a beach front property though I would say your out of luck or if your at the Grand Hyatt.
"So some resorts are allowing beach access...All public beaches have remained closed - at least officially - since the initial shut down in March correct? I know access to our beach to the north of town remains taped off...Edited: 9:47 am, July 20, 2020 "
"Since March, access to all beaches was supposed to be officially closed for public access, but we got lucky at Playa, and the barriers & patrols were removed for a couple of weeks.Over the past month, SOME beachside hotels/resorts have been allowing guests to go onto the beach, and no action was taken to remove them. Don't know if this will continue. Yesterday, there was no beach access from hotels or beach clubs."
Certainly confusing to folks with plans to visit anytime soon...Reading similar reports for Coz...
"""Certainly confusing to folks with plans to visit anytime soon..""That is for sure.BP"
Bahamas is taking it a step further. https:/…
"I’m watching this carefully, because this will be the deciding factor in our decision to keep our vacation or cancel. If we cannot go to the beach, we will not be coming. We have a pool here. And honestly I’m not a fond of the entertainment people trying to make me play fun stupid games and loud music"
Do you guys think people will start going to the beaches again even though they are closes and the police won’t care or will it be strictly enforced. This just ruined my vacation I really looked foward to the beach there has to be atleast one that people will still go to no?
Yes the Bahamas ban on commercial flights from the US is the latest embarrassment...What a shame the greatest country in the world has become The laughingstock of other developed countries...
"Jonny the beaches will be open someday, right now there is a Global pandemic raging, and activities here and anywhere in the Caribbean are restricted..."
I just dont get how closing a beach does anything. Why not make it so you have to wear a mask or only arrrive in a group of 1-2 people. It makes no sense this solves nothing except ruining peoples vacations and costing them tourist money
"Jonny, reschedule and stop whining, it is what it is.I'm normally pretty live and let live but I also believe in respecting and obeying the laws of another country when I am a visitor."
I dont care im going to the beach regardless they can kick me out if they want
#17 and that is the reason why other countries are now banning the US from visiting them.
">> ""I dont care im going to the beach regardless they can kick me out if they want""Try it and let us know how it goes.You could be spending 36 hours detained by the police."
That's 36 hours and your cellmates are NOT American and the Mohansic Golf Course is not on the activities list.
"MisterBee is correct, a woman I know who lives down a bit north of Tulum reports penalties can include a fine of 4300 pesos and/or up to 36 hours in jail.Hopefully the authorities will start to enforce the law strictly and protect their citizens from entitled jerks like Jonny."
It is time to accept that Mexico is not open for tourism and will not be until they get to the Green stage and promise to never return to more stringent phases.
"Plenty of people on the beach, in the ocean and pool at the Hard Rockhttps://www.hrhcancun.com/webcam.htm"

Some folks are just selfish bas#$&§$ with no regard for their fellow man...So disappointing...

The beaches are open to tourist only at this point or locals if they are guest at a resort but basically you have to be at a beach front hotel or resort to use the beach now.
"Post 26, Your reference to “self-entitled (NY-ers) that are the laughing stock of the developed world” is just a tad reversed from reality...lol. NY is fighting (STILL) to protect citizens, at least those who care, while the pandemic rages in other states because people feel entitled and laugh at the concept of public health and safety...It’s a terrible time, and people in every state are guilty. But for this discussion, I really don’t understand why the Mexican gov’t does not at least require evidence of a negative COVID test, whether foreigners or residents..."
"A test isn't required for many reasons including they can be faked, you need the proper staff to read them and interpret them, people can still become positive after a negative test, etc, etc. Hopefully a test will be available soon that can detect quickly if someone is infected at point of entry. If so, they are either quarantined or returned to the country that they came from (but hopefully they won't be allowed to leave their country in the first place)."
"Bluewater, this virus is a flu level event, not a middle ages bubonic plague. New York state has a fatality rate about 16 times higher than Texas (deaths/100,000 people). I don't know what is going on in several northeastern US states, but they have nothing to be proud about.As for tourism in the area, I suggest briefing residents on all aspects of this virus. That means including Mexican medical people, US medical experts and people with my view to counter the hysteria promoted by most others.Then they can verify what they have been told, discuss their options and if they chose, they can open up completely, shut down everything until a vaccine is developed (may never happen), a near 100% treatment is found (may never happen or the virus dies off (may never happen). Or any other possible course of action."
Wow. We just booked at The Five Beaches Resort for 8/25-31. Hoping the beaches will be open by then. Need my daily walk on the beach ! Anyone else planning a trip end of August ????
Yup called RIU Lupita opens 1Aug along with beach club access. We arrive 11Aug. Woo hoo!
"Post 29, a negative test (performed correctly, and within 5 days of arrival, of course) is indeed a good indicator you are not carrying the virus into that destination. It is a no-brainer, the gov’t just has to care more about the residents and the economy. You don’t think that is a good reason to screen for that? Certainly you may contract the virus during your travel, but at least you are known not to be an asymptomatic carrier.Post 30, not sure what news outlets you watch but obviously your news is just a tad skewed or actually reversed. The NE US is the one area that has been successful in minimizing the spread and opening safely. It is people returning from the southern states that are not helping.Let’s refrain from this rhetoric and keep to topic, shall we?"
"Tryan I was just at The Fives two weeks ago and saw another agent there this week and they were on the beach with no issues. I think if you’re on private property at a beachfront resort you are okay. Now walking? That I’m not sure of. I’m speaking just going into the beach in front of the resortEdited: 9:52 am, July 22, 2020 "
https:/…index.htmDeaths by state.....NE US compared to Florida. Take a look. Successful my.....
The bomb already went off in the NE with thousands suffering morbidity and mortality. At least management has improved since then of the infected. Bodies were piling up in several NY hospitals. Mexico otoh is barely testing anyone so true prevalence unknown. Buyer beware.Mexico: 6552 tests per million Bangladesh: 6473 tests per million Not to pick on Mexico but they can do better. Also trying to find state specific info
State specific data here:https:/…
"Post #33 - I would suggest that you read my post again. I simply pointed out some limitations with people providing a negative COVID-19 test as a condition of entry. If it could be done properly of course it would be helpful. If it can't be done properly as per what I have indicated then a fake negative test is worse than no test at all. We really need a test that can be done at the airport and provide rapid and accurate results. That is not yet available but is being worked on many teams in many countries. This is reality, not rhetoric."
Does this apply to resort guests?

"Beaches are closed for EVERYONE including resort guests, but no one was doing anything to remove guests who went onto the beach.That changed on Sunday when police did close the beaches, and they were instructing people to go home. The Grand Hyatt issued a letter to guests stating that beach access was closed to everyone including guests.But as time goes by, people will gradually return to the beach, Today, I saw 6 people on the beach even though the barrier is still in place."
"THEY CAN DO BETTER, by telling tourists, STAY HOME.Come on, this is like having a party at the Twin Towers, after the first strike."
