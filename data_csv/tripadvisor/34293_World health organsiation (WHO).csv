We are travelling out in 3 weeks and checking travel insurance they say insurance will be void if we go against WHO advice. I have tried to look for up to date information and can’t see any advice . ( I know it’s there somewhere) Flying Cathay Pacific from UK who will let us rebook before June but as there’s 4 of us. it’s getting holidays together again. Regards
"BBCThe new coronavirus has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China.""The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems."
Could this be relevant? https:/…The advisories from individual countries are more specific.
If you can rebook without penalty that's what I would do. At this point there is no reason to go. HK has closed most of its entry point. Lots of tourist sites are closed. And you may experience difficulty getting back to your home country. A period of quarantine is not out of the question.
"Ask your travel insurer!Another question to ask them (which I asked my travel insurer after the SARS saga - I was in HK with a one-year continuous travel insurance during that period) is what happens if the advisory comes in force while you're in an affected area already.You can of course try to rebook your flights to an unaffected place, but there's no guarantee that that place isn't affected come tomorrow."
Thank you for your advice. I will be phoning travel insurance today. The main reason for our visit was to visit my son whom is working out there. The other issue is for the 4 of us traveling is getting time off together. At present I’m going to wait and see a little longer too too see if Cathay Pacific cancel flights. Unfortunately due too sons work schedule he can’t get time off to come home.
Currently the WHO advise is not recommending to avoid travel and the spread outside of China has only increased by 7 to 153 cases since the previous day report https:/…The uncertainty might be what happens if the infections increase outside China enough for WHO change the advice and you might be travelling then.

"Don't rely on WHO for anything except political pandering to China, and issuing orders to lock the barn long after the horses have bolted. WHO leadership has been borderline criminal since mid-January, in their malfeasance and kowtowing to the Chinese government desire to downplay the seriousness of the situation."
"Hard to say, WHO is the world, China not the world nor center of the universe, ditto for Asia. These are parts and bits of the world. My friends in Asia are shocked we are not wearing mask in the US, and there is no shortage of masks. I have not seen one person wearing mask in New York City in the last 5 days. I walk in the rush hour crowd daily going to and from work in New York City, no mask and no emergency. The world is bigger than China. There is really no emergency in the world, just a part of the world."
"My issues with WHO go back decades, before China was out from under Mao's thumb. It's an organization that is unbelievably corrupt and less interested in global public health than in currying political favor and financial resources for questionable purposes. I wouldn't have a WHO ""doctor"" touch my dog, much less a human. If WHO advises not to wear a face mask, I'd wear two. Credibility less than zero."
">> Don't rely on WHO for anything except political pandering to China, and issuing orders to lock the barn long after the horses have bolted. There is a story in the French paper Le Monde on this. It is behind a pay wall. https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article…RFI (Radio France Internationale) covered the story in Chinese.http://www.rfi.fr/tw/中國/20200201-武漢疫情緊急-世衛組織為什麼遲遲作出決定Use google translate.Edited: 5:20 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"No intention to defend WHO, but if it declares a GLOBAL heath emergency, what about rest of the world has nothing to do with it? If you are in China or the Far East where everybody is wearing a mask, you’d think the whole world is the same, the fact is opposite. Where I am, no mask, no mask shortage, no crisis, economy is great, business is great, stock market is great, near zero unemployment, air is clean, water is clean. If WHO declares a global emergency, we may get piss off at WHO.BTW, public health is always politics, anywhere."
"CDC in its official docs says they never track flu death, hospitals don’t track flu death, why? Because CDC says flu doesn’t kill. There is no flu death to track, The numbers are estimates of death caused by complications resulted from flu. How they come to these numbers? CDC report is too long, too many word for me. Google it yourself."
Google it.
"I agree with Mac, the fear of Coronavirus is largely in Asia, and there is no need to wear masks in public. I’m in Los Angeles and just returned from Europe in the past week, there is no worries here and neither did CDC or WHO declare the virus to be of a pandemic."
