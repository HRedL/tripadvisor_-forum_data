"Police officers will be acting with discretion and common sense in these cases, for more details, section 5 on this link refers to the possible fines, seehttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/f…"
"Elmers is right, but there’s going to be somebody who will be made an example.This unfortunate will be a very obviously guilty person probably from a chosen group that’s been targets for maximum publicity purposes. Don’t let it be you."
"Well, I for one hope it is enforced properly."
"I hope it's enforced properly too, the rest of my family are all still having to travel to work, the only reason I'm not is because of my health and I feel so guilty about it"
"It's become clear that this outbreak is extremely serious, and anyone who believes it isn't and it's just a holiday really does need to be made examples of for the good of everyone in the front line of the fight against this disease."
"May be they can begin with all the tv news crews. I can't see how they are on essential work.""and for those who don’t mind as they have no money, I’m sure that suitable punishments can be used. ""Oh yes we are all in it together. All the well off ones sciving at home getting paid in full looking down their noses at ones with no money.What aboy offering some help to those in need rather than carping."
"There does seem to be some confusion about work. The idea isn’t that only essential work should be undertaken out of the home. The CMO was clear yesterday, I think it was, that the modelling builds in people going to work if they can’t do that work from home - the question is whether it is essential for your work that you travel to it rather than do it at home. The intention is to keep business going as much as possible, since if the economy completely collapses we’ll have no way of paying for this."
"Many businesses have been told to close. Their employees have no choice but to stay at home. Those who can't work from home but are not essential workers have a difficult choice to make, especially if they live with a person who is at risk of developing a serious illness should they get infected.At the same time, essential workers have to go to work if they are not displaying any symptoms themselves. It's a strange and challenging situation and there are no easy answers."
I hope they have a go at the easy targets.There are people still holidaying in their motor homes and camper vans on the moor. Some with the whole family. They think they are so clever being rebellious and different.
"""I hope they have a go at the easy targets.""Why would you want to single out a certain type os person. If they are driving a Mercedes then it is ok. As big a problem is those in high powered cars and motor cycles using the emptier roads as a race track.I nearly typed near empty but around me they aren't.What is puzzling me is the where the near constant stream of helicopters is going to and from Elstree aerodrome.I guess if you have the money flaunt it."
£60 is an absolute joke. I make that in an hour. Is that really a dettterent? Makes me quite angry.
"Re Post 13 ... Do I wish to know that some are earning £60 an hour or any other sum, that I used to see popping into my Bank account regularly.Thankfully, I get Benefit assistance from my local Housing & Council Tax Departments and that has to be calculated along with my State Pension and a small private pension which means that, approximately, I am living on £240 a week ... being a Senior Citizen, in West London. Annually that equates to £12,480.For the hell of it, let's say someone earning £60 an hour, before Tax, does a 40 hr week ... then their annual income sits at a gross figure of £124,800.Think of those who may need your understanding at these unprecedented times.Keep wellAnthony K"
"""£60 is an absolute joke. I make that in an hour""Some people don't make that in a day."
"Sir Don, you are welcome to pay more if you wish."
"""£60 is an absolute joke. I make that in an hour. Is that really a dettterent? Makes me quite angry.""Well good for you. So everybody on minimum wage or no wage should be fined as that they earn the same as a pratt on £60 per hour.It makes me angry that people on £2400 plus a week dictate how other less well off should live their lives.And you spelling and use of a keyboard is appalling for somebody who earns £60 per hour."
"#8 ""Oh yes we are all in it together. All the well off ones sciving at home getting paid in full looking down their noses at ones with no money.""Where do you get that they are skiving? My colleagues and I are all working from home, trying to fit that in with juggling childcare, care visits to vulnerable relatives and queueing for half an hour to enter a supermarket to shop for multiple households. Yes I'm lucky that I'm still on full pay, but I'm working bloody hard for it."
"Unless you are a registered Carer, thus a key-worker, you should not be making ""care visits to vulnerable relatives."" Those ""vulnerable relatives"" are quarantined, even from you, for good reason.Anthony K"
And how do you think they are going to eat?

"Good luck with that. I take it you don't have an elderly, infirm, fairly immobile relative. Even if I could get an online delivery, he couldn't carry the bags inside, unpack them and cook. Really, don't preach when you don't know the circumstances. Care visits are one of the allowed reasons for leaving your house.Edited: 6:47 am, March 31, 2020 "

A couple with a 3 year old child were struggling, yes struggling. Both working from home and between the 2 of them couldn't both do their work at home and deal with the 3 year old who ""demanded"" constant attention. Really. How do they theink the child carer dealt with this demanding 3 year old,.They were getting 2 incomes. Try doing it with no income."
"""You can go online and place an order to be billed to you and delivered wherever needed.""hahahahahahahaAnd the elderly who don't know one end of a keyboard or tablet from the other, assuming they are even connected.This is like the Government speaking. Do everything on line, there is no nned for cash. Everything is cashless now. Try living in the real World."
I am classed as an essential worker so still going to work. I have a letter from my work that allows me out to work.
"Currently we dont need such letters in the UK, though it is obviously something that might come in.Id need one rather sharpish if they brought it in as I have to do daily checks at work."
"#24. I'm not going to speak for anyone else. How can you? I am working far more than 8 hours a day as back office support for key workers. My colleagues who have children are working when they can, late into the evening and at weekends. It's not about hours, it's about getting the job done. Which in the public sector usually means far more hours than you're paid for."
"""Currently we dont need such letters in the UK, though it is obviously something that might come in.""My work have issued us with letters in case we are stopped. I don't know what clout they actually have in real life though!"
"""are you really telling me that everybody working from home is doing a full 8 hour day.""I guess not everyone but I would think most people have. If childcare is becoming a problem, then some people are doing 'split shifts' with work before children get up and then more work after they go back to sleep.""I head thsi on Womans Hour yesterday.""1st rule of Women's Hour - don't believe everything on Women's Hour."
"“ Grocery stores will do non-contact, to the door, delivery services of Goods, ordered online, at acceptable times of the day.You can go online and place an order to be billed to you and delivered wherever needed“Not in my area of London you can’t. No slots available at all even for vulnerable people."
^^^ Same with my area of Chicago. I did have luck once online shopping at midnight. New time slots had become available. Perhaps in London also? Good luck!
"""Which in the public sector usually means far more hours than you're paid for.""Well at least you are getting paid something. And by the way, people in the private sector also have to do unpaid hours.I hope that the Government is keeping an eye on the level or resentment in the country that there clearly is between the haves and the have nots."
"I am thankful that I continue to have a job and money coming in, and I am sorry for those who now don't, but it's not my fault. No person is to blame, and it's pointless and divisive to drive resentment or imply that people you don't know are lazy, fraudulent and undeserving."

"I, too, have a letter from work just in case. While our line of work doesn't seem ""essential"" at first glance, some of our products are actually supplied to manufacturers of medical devices.Currently I am the only person in the company not in a high risk group so go in a few days a week.However, I know someone who splits her time between Germany and the UK and has a place close to my office. As she is in Germany at the moment, she has kindly offered that I stay at her flat when I have two consecutive office days. An offer I accepted.Just to add, I am more socially distant in the office than anywhere else. The last few office days, I was the only person in the building and had the garden (shared with 10 other buildings) to myself."
">>My work have issued us with letters in case we are stopped<<Oh same here, they arrived today for us as the Uni did it in case things went that far and simply so essential staff have something to wave to make things quicker as there are police patrols pulling people over on radial roads.Edited: 1:36 pm, March 31, 2020 "
There had to be an example!https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-n…Ouch!
"""North Tyneside Magistrates' Court imposed a £660 fine under the Coronavirus Act 2020 on Monday.""Now that's gotta smart ...Anthony K"
"I was under the (mistaken?) impression that you didn't have to give your name to the police or tell them what you were doing - so long as you weren't doing anything wrong.So she wouldn't have been fined for that. If she was doing something wrong, or wouldn't explain what she was doing when they arrested her, then refusing to give her name or an explanation, would aggravate the offence. But she had to have been breaching the regulations in the first place. (Until someone who knows puts me right, of course.)And, while I'm at it, the government is not saying only people doing “essential” work can go to work. Anyone who cannot work from home can still go to work."
">>are you really telling me that everybody working from home is doing a full 8 hour day<<Oh no, we just sit on our a*ses doing nothing."
>>> are you really telling me that everybody working from home is doing a full 8 hour day.<<<Do you really believe that everybody working in a workplace of any kind is putting in a full 8 hour shift ?
"Re 38-40, even though the case had been approved by the CPS and she had been convicted by the magistrates, comment from lawyers and a report in The Times querying the validity of the charge has led to the police and CPS applying to the court to have the conviction set aside because they applied the wrong law. They are not going to pursue a prosecution under any other provision:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-n…Whatever the rights and wrongs of her action, the fact that she could be prosecuted and convicted without anyone realising that the law didn't say what the police obviously thought it did is very worrying. As Lord Sumption recently said, the police are not entitled to operate as enforcers of what ministers say in guidance, only in enforcing what Parliament passes as law."
"So it would appear (#40) that I know more about the law than the police, the CPS and the magistrates. I'm not sure whether to be pleased or not.In the end I daresay she probably was away from home unlawfully, it will have helped to get the basic message across, and the wrong has been swiftly righted. So no bad thing?"
"I can't wait to get back to work on Monday! I was bored to death sitting about at home on my day off on annual leave today, and I will be bored to death over the weekend too! Easter weekend will be even worse - 4 days off with no pubs, restaurants, museums, shops etc etc open! All of these people ""self isolating"" or ""working from home"" are taking the pee pee and behaving as if it's one big holiday! They post all over Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram - ""poor me, poor us, 12th day of self isolation, BLAH BLAH BLAH""......then you'll see them down Asda or Tesco half an hour later, or out running in their newly acquired lycra, or cycling with the kiddiwinks on their brand new bicycles, that have actually been in the garage since 2017! Grrr!"
"All of these people ""self isolating"" or ""working from home"" are taking the pee pee and behaving as if it's one big holiday!Not so, I have been forced into 12 weeks isolation for a health condition that makes me vulnerable, I'm a front line worker, I should be out there with my colleagues but instead I'm stuck at home and yes I put loads of posts on Facebook cos I'm so bored I have nothing else to do."
"Obviously I didn't mean ""All""! Please allow me to use some artistic licence to demonstrate that a hell of a lot of people are STILL taking the pee pee! Stay safe Red W. ;-)"

""">>are you really telling me that everybody working from home is doing a full 8 hour day<<Oh no, we just sit on our a*ses doing nothing.""Well some appear to spend all theit time doing the child care.And before the crisis when ever I hear "" working from home"", well may be a bit.At my last job one of my co workers was working from home, well she was working but it was just for another client."
"""""North Tyneside Magistrates' Court imposed a £660 fine under the Coronavirus Act 2020 on Monday.""Now that's gotta smart ...Anthony K""Yes especially as the police acted incorrectly."
Police acting incorrectly ... quelle surprise.CheersAnthony K
Cam I think some of those at home have been furloughed so are at home but not working.
"""Police acting incorrectly ... quelle surprise.""They threw some dye on some lake in Derbyshire.The perils of rushed out emergency legislation."
"#53 I think many have been furloughed so are at home not working.The point that I was really trying to make was that far from all being in this together there are many many people who are suffering more than others, not withastanding those that actualy have the virus.There are however a lot of very defamatory comments being slung about and I am guessing by a lot of people who aren't really having to suffer becasue they can work from home. It seems that some people's perception of having it tough is they work more hours than they are being paid for. Well that is normal anyway. Or they can't juggle working at home and dealing with child care."
"""The point that I was really trying to make was that far from all being in this together ...

There was an extremely depressing article on the BBC News business page. I am not going to repeat it here but suggesting that the economic indicators are pointing to a far worse recession than 2008 and akin to the great depression.
"The great depression of 2020 is a ferocious cloud of virulence hanging over every landscape, seascape and cityscape, that does not have a silver lining.Personally, my monetary losses could be no more than a few pounds that I have in my Current Account, that I might have to spend sooner than expected.I live in the UK, Covid-19 or no Covid-19, I am oppressed by a Government that is determined to ruin my nation.C'est la vieAnthony K"
I’m no fan of this government Antony but I think your statement is something of an insult to those many people in the world forced to live under oppressive regimes .
"<<< ""Police acting incorrectly ... quelle surprise.""They threw some dye on some lake in Derbyshire. >>>Which they have done at least twice in the past to deter people from swimming in it, seeing as it's an old quarry, with rusting machinery and rotting carcasses in it, and has a chemical make-up similar to bleach."

"Re Post 60 ... then rather than throwing dye in it, wouldn't it have been better to, simply, drain it and remove all the detritus. Anthony K"
"Just a thought, but who would be responsible and pay for safely draining it? It’s always easy to come up with neat ideas.... but ?"
"How on earth do you drain a quarry and clear it of rubbish and make the water safe?If people can't take personal responsibility to not swim in it then that's their problem.If putting dye in it to stop day tourists then so be it. These are odd times and quick decisions have to be made. It wasn't a life changing decision, so no harm done."
smudge99If you drain the quarry and remove the detritus why fill it with water... a dry quarry would be hard to swim in.Anthony K
"""Which they have done at least twice in the past to deter people from swimming in it, seeing as it's an old quarry, with rusting machinery and rotting carcasses in it, and has a chemical make-up similar to bleach.""In that case won't the dye make it more attractive!"
"Quarrys tend to fill up with ground water, that’s why it’s full of water. So you’d need to pump it for time immemorial, who’d pay for it? Sorry but a ridiculous idea."
"I believe it was proposed to drain it, but the conclusion was that to do so would pose a danger to the local water supply. And no-one filled it up in the first place. It's a hole in the ground. It rains in Derbyshire.In any case the point here is that this is really fake news. Someone wanted a bit more in their newspaper report than the using drones to photograph walkers. They found this.

"In other news, the Health Secretary said: ""If you don't want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home, then you've got to follow the rules.""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52172035Lets see how many thousands of idiots go to the beach today in this warm and sunny weather! :-/"
I hope the Government has the army on standby as the police will not be able to enforce a stricter lockdown if exercise outside the home is banned. The overwhelming majority are following the guidelines and doing what is asked of us. Target the individuals who are not doing so. Sledgehammers to crack nuts comes to mind.
