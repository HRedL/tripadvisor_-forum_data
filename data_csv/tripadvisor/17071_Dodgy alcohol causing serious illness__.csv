Im due to fly to cancun on honeymoon in two weeks and am hearing about people getting very sick and one dying from sub par alcohol. We are staying in the secrets maroma resort..is it safe to go??
Adulterated Booze cut with rubbing alcohol has been an issue here and there! If it is ingested it can make you gravely ill or in some instances be fatal.  Waterd down booze is more of a problem at some places. It stratches the pours out and maximizes profits.Having said that it is not an epidemic in the area. If you get a drink that smells funny dump it. Most of us have our favorite types or brands of liqour and know exactly what they taste like if it's off to you dump it. I don't believe there is a reason to be scared at this point but certainly be vigillant.I've never been to Secrets Maroma it has a great reputation and is one of the best Resorts around IMO. Congrats on your Nuptials and have a great stay!!
"People ""dying"" is not an epidemic in Cancun like the Media wants you to think.  go and enjoy yourself!!!"
"We just came back from this area. We ONLY drank at our resort. If you're off your resort I'd recommend ONLY drinking bottled water or beer in a bottle/can. We didn't get sick our entire trip, I think that sticking to mixed drinks/water/any drinks with ice -at your resort- will keep you free and clear :)"
"There are 2 issues here. One is the potential for adulterated alcohol and the other is the potential for eating or drinking contaminated food. The OP is concerned about the adulterated alcohol - which is an issue, but not nearly as big of one as the media would like us to think it is. A juicy story about Mexicans poisoning Americans with bad booze gets a lot of hits. The issues with the alcohol seem to have a few different causes. Some cases sound like it is clearly adulterated alcohol. Other cases sound like guests were drugged (by whom is not clear). And other cases sound like people have just drunk too much, too quickly. I don't believe that the adulterated alcohol is as big of an issue as some because if it was, then lots of people would get sick. In almost every case, it is a couple people here, and a couple people there."
