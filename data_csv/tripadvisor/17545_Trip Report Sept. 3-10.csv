"Hello everyone, after being glued to my computer screen monitoring the Tropical Storms etc., I wanted to let you know that we had a fantastic week! Some rain here and there, which is obviously expected. Beaches weren't bad at all. We went to Mullet (was a bit rough) but swimable. Then Cupecoy, was beautiful and Baie Rouge which was the calmest. Great Bay surprisingly was really nice too, took a dip after some shopping....Only huge difference that I noticed from my many years of travel in SXM are the mosquitos....much more this time (which is probably because of hurricane season) and they attack the most right after sunset. So just drown yourself in repellant and you'll be all good! I finally got to do the extreme zip lining....it was truly an awesome experience....just amazing!! We stayed at the Royal Palm this time, it was very clean...again a few mosquitos in our room which was a bit annoying because I couldn't get away from them...we were on the 2nd floor, nice view. The pool was closed after our third day for renovations. Traffic on the island seems to have gotten worse and worse, but I understand that they were trying to clean up the island, so I fully understand.....Any questions....my pleasure to answer."
I just love trip reports!Did you get to any restaurants?The mosquitos are always bad after a hurricane passes through.How much was the zip lines-did you do the extreme?Did you get to eat at the Loterie Farm? I love that place.Thanks for posting.
"We got to a few! Seems like the time just flew by!! Wish I were able to do more. We did Toppers, Pinapple Pete's, the Royal Palm's resturant is actually very good as well....Yes I did the extreme! It was 55 Euros, which was $71 US. It was a fantastic experience! Never has so much fun!"
"Thank you for the post, it makes me look forward to the visit, and I wasn't even thinking about Mosquitos. We have reservations at the atrium oct 9. Anything that is a must do?"
glad you had a good trip! unfortunately mosquitos and denague fever have reached epidemic levels in the caribbean and eastern mexico this year (well before hurrican season). glad you used repellent and hope everyone reading this does as well!
