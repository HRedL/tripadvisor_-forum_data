"Not to take this lightly, but if things there don't improve, they may want to consider turning some of the hotels into hospitals, This is a 2 day old report. Yesterday was a ""new"" record at 7,615 reported cases and 578 more deaths.https:/…"
"Ted....seems the tempest in the teapot continues. The saddest part of this entire Covid virus is that no one is telling the entire story. 80% of all deaths occur in people over the age of 65. Many of those under 65 who have died have had compromising health issues which narrows the real threat to many of the infected to about 10% of all deaths. Certainly masks, distancing and cleanliness will help diminish infection but the reality is that for 90% of those infected they will recover. So it seems to me that we should be protecting the elderly more vigorously than any other age demographic. I lost my mother to Covid in May due to poor management in the care facility in which she resided. So as I see it, if you are 65 or older you have a real problem otherwise all this ballyhoo about Covid is nothing more than an absurd concoction perpetrated on the general public by the fourth estate and dirty politicians.https:/…older-adults.html"
"On possitive note, the US federal government is saving about 160 million a month in social security payments they no longer have to make."
#2What a sick and insensitive comment.
It was a sarcastic comment related to the statement above that it only affects those 65 or older.
"Gennarro, Sorry for the loss of your mother due to Covid19 in May.  While the facility might be partly to blame (idk), certainly your governor is also complicent for actually sending Covid19 patients to care facilities/nursing homes, which undoubtedly exposed those most vulnerable to succumbing to Corona to begin with.Again very sorry for your loss."
"gotyourpajamas, thank you."
"Yes, sarcasm after somebody shares the fact that their mother died from covid. Pretty insensitive but sadly that's the norm on this forum."
"Saw an article today that showed Oxford has a vaccine showing great promise, and said there might be a vaccine before the end of the year. Cross my fingers for a December trip!!"
"TedI hope you have been appropriately scolded by our resident schoolmarm.She of course, fails to realize that you and G have shared many an adult beverage, and are, in fact friends.But that's not important to those self absorbed, holier than thou denizens from our left coast.Virtue signaling is what they do."

"Gennaro, so sorry to hear about your mother. She must have been close to 100 years old, given your age. But it is always sad to lose your mother, no matter when. I also lost a close relative early on to Covid, he wasn't a senior citizen, but did suffer from cancer. Perhaps it was a blessing. It was that death that led me to get out of dodge. Ted, I think you should pick up your girlfriend/sister and get her out of the city and you out of Florida. The death count that came out in Florida today is horrendous. Florida is reporting 11,461 new cases per day; 3.79 million US cases and 140,716 deaths as of 1:00 pm on July 20."
"Leroy, Florida is not a safe place to be, especially the east coast. However, if I were to require hospitalization because of the virus or for any other reason, I'd rather be there than in Mexico. My chances of survival would be 100% better in Florida. As long as we're talking numbers, Florida has tested over 3 million people and has recorded 5,075 deaths on 360,000 positive cases to date, whereas Mexico has only tested 830,000 people to date and has recorded 40,000 deaths on 350,000 positive cases. More than 1 out of every 10 with Covid-19 die in Mexico versus 1 out of every 70 in Florida. Now Leroy, you want to talk about the cartels?Edited: 8:37 am, July 21, 2020 "
"""More than 1 out of every 10 with Covid-19 die in Mexico versus 1 out of every 70 in Florida. ""This is misleading. The reason for the higher mortality is it takes more serious symptoms or hospitalization to get diagnosed with COVID in Mexico. You cite the numbers yourself. This has been stated over and over on tripadvisor Mexico.Edited: 8:54 am, July 21, 2020 "
"Ah! I see the Old Fart Jokes are falling flat with those that are not aware of us Old Farts!Shame on you two!! I'll buy the next round.Here in MN we still hover around a 4% Positive test rate, with 70+% of fatalities still occurring at Senior facilities. So our hypochondriacal population remains about the same.I still have my Tinfoil Hat on about when this really did hit the U.S. shores and think it was months sooner than the February reporting. But that's just me, and I might (chuckle) be a bit cynical.Y'all do for you what ya gotta do.LaterKeith"
"Actually Keith, there is some speculation that some of the people we were with in Ixtapa/Zihua back in January may have had it then, my wife being one of them. Another couple who stayed into February also had mild symptoms. Without readily available ""post"" Covid testing, it's hard to say, but would be nice to know."
After returning from Z in February my spouse and me were both sick with all the covid symptoms for three weeks. Not terribly ill but enough to get us to a doctor. Recently we both went to be tested for Covid anti-bodies and came up negative for both of us. Patiently here waiting for the vaccine. I see it happening late November.
"Gen, I SO hope you're right....that would be just in time for my December trip...Mike"
Hardly any testing in Mexico. On par with Bangladesh and Guatemala.
"Keith,You are *not* an Old FartTechnically, you are an Ancient Fart.And yes, you can buy the *first* round. But make it quick, we dont know how much longer you're gonna be around.Edited: 4:56 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"Mikey, I'm thinking you might want to rethink your plans. You dont want to be travelling from one petri dish to another..G is nothing if not hopelessly optimistic.Edited: 5:24 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"Optimism is all I've got at this point Babba….IF i get a vaccine, I'm there!Mike"
"Brother, I hear you... That being said, from what I see from this side of the border, I'm not filled with confidence. In my tiny corner of the planet, we haven't had a case in days. Everybody has obeyed the obvious.. Wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands. Duh..Frankly I look south of the border and shudder,.All the best to you"
"Yup, and another 6,859 cases today with 915 more deaths."
