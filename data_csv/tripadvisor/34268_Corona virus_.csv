We hope to visit in late April. Have there been any reported cases of corona virus in the area? Thanks
"Have you tried googling ""coronavirus nîmes""? If you go to the general France forum you can read through the dozens of posts on this subject in the various forums."
"By late April it's very likely that they will be reported cases of Coronavirus pretty much everywhere (including where you live).Here you have a day by day report of the situation in France https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-…If youdownload the pdf (""télécharger"") under ""point épidémiologique"" you have a breakdown of the cases by French region. Currently there are some cases reported for all French regions.Edited: 1:48 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"Wait. That is seven weeks away. If you have already booked flights etc and cancel now you will not get any money back. When governments start banning travel and airlines stop flying, then you are going to get a refund.Check your insurance situation now.Meanwhile, just do the only thing you or anyone else can, keep up with the news."
"Thanks everyone. I realize the situation may change, but wanted a current status. I will keep updated through the website Soph provided, as the Paris forum has many threads, but all focused on Paris.A few cases will not stop our going, but I have a weak immune system and need to be more careful than most people.My biggest fear is a major outbreak occurring after we arrive in France and facing cancelled return flights or a 14 day quarantine similar to that imposed by the US regarding Italy.Thanks again for everyone being so helpful."
I'm in Nimes right now. Life is going on as usual. Anyone's guess what will happen nearly 2 months from now.
"I suggested searching the general France forum, not the Paris forum, and there are many threads under the general France forum category for many locations in France. And I'll assume you can use google to find out any needed updated info for anywhere on the planet. I understand your concern but this is a developing situation and no one in France has any special info that can't otherwise be found on any number of internet sites. The situation changes daily and will obviously be different in roughly two months from now when you visit (for better or worse) and only you can decide what level of risk you are willing to accept (with relevant government warnings)."
"This website is updated hourly https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/It is worth noting that at 08.00 today the raw death rate was 6.2% for USA and 1.7% for France. So, France has twice the cases, but only half the deaths of US."
"Mike Pence himself has said that the USA will not have enough kits to test all the suspected cases, and it's likely that the actual number of cases in USA is much higher than the official one.Edited: 3:02 am, March 06, 2020 "
The overall global raw death rate is around 3.5%.France has 423 cases and 7 deaths or 1.65%US has 233 cases and 14 deaths or 6.0%Something curious either in US or with US data ?
"I heard on the news this morning that people in USA have to pay for their tests, unlike in Europe where we have national healthcare systems.So if you are ill and cannot afford the doctor, in the USA the more likelihood you die.I don't know if that explains it, but it was stated in that context."
"Now rich folks could also catch it, could that cause a swing to the ""Obamacare loving"" democrats ?"
"No, people in the US will not have to pay for testing if their insurance does not cover it.And comparing the 14 reported deaths here to the 7 in France is meaningless because the numbers are so small. The virus may have arrived here before it did in France and so much depends on who is exposed to it. An early exposure in the US was in a nursing home, so sadly there were a cluster of deaths there."
">>No, people in the US will not have to pay for testing if their insurance does not cover it.<<About 1/3 of the US are not covered to regulations requiring free testing, at least as of this morninghttps:/… The new $8.3 billion law expands testing, but I haven't seen reports that it guarantees free testing. Does it?"
"Re: high percentage of U.S. deaths: I believe most of the deaths occurred after the virus struck a nursing home.Edited: 12:03 am, March 07, 2020 "
"I'm also in Nimes at the moment, and it's business as usual. You may want to avoid crowded areas like the gare at peak times, but there's a chance the warmer weather in April will limit the spread of the virus. If you can't get your money back, you can always wait to spend anything else. There's lots you can do here just by taking the bus (even goes to Avignon), which requires no advance booking and is 3 euros roundtrip. Best of luck!"
"Thanks Artemis. Reading that Merkel believes 60-70% of Germans my become infected has made me very pessimistic that Barcelona and Paris, which I planned to visit before and after Nimes, will be regarded as safe to visit."
