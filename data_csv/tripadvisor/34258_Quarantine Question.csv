It specifically says ...((look at the end of letter B below, and the ending part on Quarantine.))II. ELIGIBILITYIndividuals who obtain testing pursuant to this Order must be (1) at least 12 months of age or older, and (2)fall into one of the categories outlined in sections A, B, or C below.

Thanks. I was told by a Hilton rep that the policy was essentially “shelter in place.
