any tentative date for bars opening up?
"No, nothing yet."
"Most restaurants have a bar and those are open, but you can't sit or stand at the bar - only at a table or take out."
At the restaurants with bars do you need to order food in order to have drinks? Just curious if restrictions are similar to our requirements here in NY to help prevent social drinking at bars late night...

"I have major problems with this new advisory. Look at the criteria for determining levels (https:/…how-level-is-determined.html) and then take into account that (a) the population of the USVI is on four different islands; (b) the CDC bases it's criteria on positive cases per 100,000 population and the population of the USVI is total 160,000; (c) we are doing a larger number of tests than many other jurisdictions and the majority are very mild cases; (d) since the virus came to our shores we have (albeit sadly) recorded only 9 Covid-related deaths; and (d) there has never been more than two at a time patients hospitalized here with Covid-19 and currently just one on St Thomas and one on St Croix. Also note that the CDC recommends that visitors to the USVI have typhoid vaccinations before traveling here (there hasn't been a case of typhoid here in generations); and they also recommend rabies vaccines because ""bats in the USVI carry rabies"" - which in fact they don't (https:/…usvirgin-islands).I believe the CDC confuses us with the poorest areas of such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic."
"All good points STTResident, appreciate this more realistic “look” at the situation on STT in particular."
