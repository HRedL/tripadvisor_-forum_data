Just wondered if anybody knew of cash is still being accepted in Trogir or do business prefer card? Trying to work out wether worth changing my money before etc?Thanks:)
"Cash is definitely accepted everywhere. However due to current situation with COVID-19, some supermarkets prefer contactless cards. Either way, you're safe."
Amazing thank you!!!
"Some restaurants didn't take cards - so check out menus before you sit down. However, I suspect that Covid-19 may have changed that."
"Very helpful thank you, we found that when we did Dubrovnik years ago but thought Rona might have flipped the situation completely but I definitely will get some currency changed even if itâ€™s just used for tipping etc in the end always helpful to have some :)"
