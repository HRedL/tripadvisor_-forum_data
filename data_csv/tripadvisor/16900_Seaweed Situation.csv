Can anyone recently back from EPM or TBH report on the abnormal sargassum invasion? How bad is the seaweed at the beach? I've been reading reviews and it seems to be an issue all over including the Caribbean.
We had one day where it was piled up about a foot deep with dead fish. Down at beloved the guys were fishing them out and putting them in black sacks (probably for the beloved buffet ;-)It really didn't bother us and some days it was nice and clear. At the end of the day if it is a particularly bad day you can always retreat to the pool.

Oh wow thanks for the pics.
Holy crap. That's even worse than we had it last year. At least our sea grass was free of dead fish. Gross.
"'I've been reading reviews and it seems to be an issue all over including the Caribbean'You're right Johnny, the reviews and threads I've been reading recently seem to indicate there is a lot if sea grass on lots of beaches in lots of different areas for some reason??!!"
"That is beyond gross and I can't believe it's all over the Caribbean . I just looked at pictures from people in Jamaica and others in PDC,and I'm not seeing this.....am I seeing dead fish too ?"
"I've been reading reviews mentioning Seagrass/weed H7, but not seen any pics with a dead fish in it!! LOL"
"Hclub, that's a dead fish alright... BBQ anyone?"
"The seaweed was worse when we were there, but luckily there were no dead fish."
"BeachWanderer, looking at the two pictures more closely, while it seems to be piled a bit thicker at the shore than when we were there, I think it was wider-- we would have had to go a good 30 feet before finding clear water (no thanks- eww).Edited: 5 years ago "
"Champagne- same here. There was a much wider band of ""weed"" actually in the water that we would have had to wade through if we wanted to enter the water."
"BTW I have a friend staying at Live Aqua in Cancun right now. I asked her about sea grass and she says there is none- so it's not ""all over the Caribbean""."
"I actually saw it in Barbados, north coast, when I was there in August and my friend in Antigua said its a problem there as well. The webcams in Akumal and Playa del Carmen has been showing varying degrees of the seaweed pile up over the past few weeks.Edited: 5 years ago "

I can't imagine swimming it that water. We love Excellence but when we were there a few years ago the sea weed in the water was almost as bad. I don't think this is anything new or going to go away in the future. Just a fact of life and only varies in the severity.

"I would think between the fish and the seagrass, it couldn't smell that great either...."
"I believe Johnny too, and I have read several threads recently about this problem elsewhere, but thats Mother Nature for you."
its part of climate change.
We have just returned from a 21 night trip to Punta / Cap Cana and many resorts there have had problems with weed in the last few weeks
"<BTW I have a friend staying at Live Aqua in Cancun right now. I asked her about sea grass and she says there is none- so it's not ""all over the Caribbean''>Johnny, Champers is right, it's not 'all over the Caribbean' just certain areas :-)"
"I try my best!! :-) anyway, I'm younger than you cheeky!!"
We have just come back from EPM from 2 week holiday. Some days there was seaweed and other days nice & clear . We were there also the day that the fish washed up all along the shoreline - even as far as the new Secrets. Not sure what had happened. The day before we went over to Isla & the same thing there - a few dead fish we thought it was from one of the fishing boats along the shoreline. We did have two days of storms not sure if the weather / currents brought them to shore.The seaweed was only at the shoreline we didn't have to wade through & the sea was lovely with sand beneath your feet and no rocks. I will try and post some pictures shortly along with my review.
Thanks for the informationVery strange about all the dead fish
slickpic.com/users/…Pictures of the beach during our stay 10-25 October. We were on the beach most days except when there were thunderstorms & the 'fishy day'
Thanks for the photosWe saw far worse in Punta / Cap Cana on a few days
"Depending on where u stay,the resort will hire a Seaweed Removal team that will remove seaweed all day long.and believe me they do a great job.."
"Good pic's aligaz. Guess that's old Mother Nature for you. The clean up seems a bit of a fruitless task and maybe more of an attempt to psychologically pacify guests (no bad thing)Really didn't affect our use of the beach, maybe visits to Southend on sea (apologies to cousins across the pond if this reference means nothing to you) as a youngster, where there were much worse things to stand in or smell, has given me a different tolerance."
"Thanks for the pics aligaz, the beach actually looks pretty nice ! Hope it's as nice in 3 weeks :)"
JohnnyHave you had any issue with weed in Trinidad?
"We are here now and haven't had much of a problem. One day it was pretty bad but the resort does a good job cleaning it up, and it wasn't bad enough not to go in the ocean"
What happened to Johnny's reply to the question about seaweed in Trinidad with links to their local newspapers? It seems to have disappeared. It was interesting to read about. Perhaps TA removed it because a Q and A about seaweed in various destinations was off-topic to Playa Mujeres? That would certainly make sense if that were the case.
Odd that there is no removal message for the deleted post
"<Odd that there is no removal message for the deleted post>Flip, I agree. It's hard sometimes to figure out why some things disappear on TA and others stay up with messages with why they were removed.Edited: 5 years ago "
"""Perhaps TA removed it because a Q and A about seaweed in various destinations was off-topic to Playa Mujeres?""More than likely. It was totally irrelevant here."
"I think because Johnny thought the problem was ''all over including the Caribbean'' people began to compare areas. As we all know, some threads do digress!! Just hope the seagrass isn't causing problems next October!!(342 days!!)"
"<More than likely. It was totally irrelevant here.>You're probably right, Champagne. It was not about PM. I'm just not sure why the question didn't disappear as well since that was also off-topic from the seaweed situation in PM, or, why, we didn't see one of those official off-topic posts reminding members to discuss London when on the London forums or whatever it is they say, exactly."
"Obviously a very bad year for the region in general. I have been reading these forums for years and have never seen threads posted for Playa Maroma, Tulum, and other areas before. Over 10 days in Sept. we had 2 bad days in Puerto Morelos and one moderately heavy day at EPM. tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g150812-i23-k79026…"
"<Johnny, Have you had any issue with weed in Trinidad?> I also wondered what the seaweed situation in Trinidad was like?But as Champers and RM rightly point out, it was way off topic.I'm pleased to see from recent reports it now appears to be much better in the PM area."
"<I also wondered what the seaweed situation in Trinidad was like?>Jerry, you sound unsure about whether you were wondering this, but in case you were, here is a link to the Trinidad and Tobago forums to help you with your trip planning there:tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g147387-i548-Trini…So good that things are better in the last few days with the seaweed situation in PM! I hope that remains, but things are so changeable on that beach."
Or any beach RMtripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g663501-i11489-k…
It's an epidemic!! Johnny may have been onto something?Thanks RMEdited: 5 years ago 
"The seaweed has been a problem for many areas this year, Google Galveston seaweed 2014 to see how bad it can be. There is some interesting information here http://seas-forecast.com/ including a map showing the loop route the weed takes from the Sargasso sea and a forecast section based on observations for certain areas."
"No problem, Jerry! Enjoy Trinidad and Tobago. I've met many people from there who are quite wonderful so I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I've heard no concerns with seaweed where I am headed, so I'm not concerned. It's always better to start with a nicer beach regardless, IMO. However, you do have those lovely pools at places like EPM to help balance out that beach so that's a nice fall back to those who are heading to PM if they do have to deal with a seaweed problem."
Just saw my comment was removed but yes sea weed in this part of the world as well .
Thanks Johnny ;-)
