"Wondering how big an issue is measles for travelers visiting Paris? Particularly for people travelling with kids, who might not be able to get the MMR vaccine - babies under 6 months, or immunocompromised kids."
Does Paris pose a particular threat? I wouldn't see why--but I can understand how air travel in general (all that germy air in the plane) would be a risk for picking up any kind of virus. There are doctors who specialize in travel and contagious diseases (and of course your pediatrician) with whom you should consult.
Paris specifically because of the measles outbreak in Europe...and France is supposed to have been hit hard.
"France has one of the longest life expectancies in the Western world and an excellent healthcare system. There has been a slight rise in the number of cases, which is still less than 1000 in the entire country for 2012. Not exactly an 'outbreak' and far from being 'hard hit' I think you ma want to change your news source."
"The vaccine being highly recommended and widely done in children aged 1 year old, I've never heard of a case of measles around me (and with three kids I know a bunch of families in three different schools).Looking for figures, I find there were one thousand people hospitalized with measles in France last year. It's too much, considering the aim was to completely eradicate the illness, but still not enough to be called an epidemic."
"Phread, Flore, and I all have kids in the school system in France....and not one of us know anyone who's had the measles. I haven't seen a single flyer or memo to parents come home -- and this in a system which sends home flyers for lice and stomach flu.That 1000 cases is out of population of 62 million (plus visitors!) -- so it's still happily very, very rare, and I'm guessing the incidence of measles in the US is at least as high, if not higher, especially given the drift in recent years of not vaccinating children (which is an entirely different issue)Edited: 7 years ago "
I work with children and have never heard of a measles outbreak here either.
"The ''epidemic'', such as it is, is down in the south west.The year before it was in the south east, mainly Hault alpesThe number of cases has been miniscule in terma of the population but as mentioned earlier this is considered an epidemic because the authorities want zero cases.more info here…sante.fr/Dossiers-thematiques/Maladies-infe…Edited: 7 years ago "
"Thank you all. In the US, we were told there is an outbreak in Europe and france is one of the countries heavily hit. Hence this question...."
"is it 1000 cases or 1000 hospitalized -- since measles rarely requires hospitalization that would be an issueit is risky to travel anywhere including the US with babies too young to have their full vaccination -- whooping cough and measles have both made a comeback all over the world on the other hand, most people my age have had measles and pretty much everything else that kids today avoid and lived to tell the tale -- it is a calculated risk -- measles rarely causes life long damage or death in an otherwise healthy child -- although it can -- we actually had a family friend who lost a son to measles at age 5 when I was a child --"
"My data was very clear it was 1000 hospitalized in 2011, and the site selkieNice refers to has a number of 14996 cases for 2011, but it seems from their graphs that the 2011 epidemic break has passed, and there'll be much fewer cases in 2012 (maybe as little as 1000 actual cases for 2012).You can follow epidemics in France week by week here, if that looks like fun : http://websenti.u707.jussieu.fr/sentiweb/The three main diseases followed are chickenpox, gastroenteritis and flu-like syndrom.Edited: 7 years ago "
"I know a young adult who has been hospitalized for two weeks due to measles (high fever and difficulties breathing). He had no long lasting side effect, just a big fear."
Is this in Paris?
"Yes, in Paris but it was at least a year ago and now he's 100% ok.(he's 25ish)Edited: 7 years ago "
"okay - thank you. I have visited paris many times when i was single... was really looking forward to this trip. Hopefully, I don't need to cancel it!"
"Just follow up with your doctor if your kids are too young yet for the vaccine or are immunocompromised. This would apply to any travel, especially when using mass transit and, of course, flights."
