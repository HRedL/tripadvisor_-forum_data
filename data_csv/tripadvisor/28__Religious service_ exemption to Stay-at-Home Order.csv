"The Order of the Governor, specifying ""religious"" group exemption, may not be fully in alignment with other Florida priorities including temporary limit on COVID-19 diagnosed and asymptomatic transmission risk: 1. Florida, with a large population (3rd-largest US state, over 20 million residents), thus has substantial COVID-19 transmission risk. 2. About 25% (about 4 million) of those residents are older than 60—COVID-19 vulnerable. 3. The economy relies heavily on an $86 billion/yr. tourism industry; family protection from COVID-19 risk has public confidence and business implications. 4. Orlando-area theme parks and water parks had averaged over 250,000 visitors daily. The business model of many is packed crowds—acute COVID-19 risk.5. Among 125 million annual visitors are up to one million ‘snowbirds”—many elderly with age and preexisting condition COVID-19 risk.6. The data expresses COVID-19 risk: prior to the Order, Florida had over 7700 COVID-19 cases (1000 within the prior 24 hours) and more than 100 deaths.Edited: 11:25 am, April 02, 2020 "

"Re: Post 321. A thread including public health concerns should not be suppressed. 2.

The data is over 1 million cases, over 54,000 deaths and over 38,000 other critically or seriously ill COVID-19 international cases have already been identified. Of these, almost one-quarter-million cases are in the US—more than twice as many as any other country. In Florida, some models predict as many as 10,000 deaths if full, serious and systematic measures are not implemented.3. Respect means respect for the dignity and worth of each contributor making their best effort, and respect for each human life at risk in this catastrophe. Suggestions for how to best accomplish this should be given immediate attention on the merits.4.

"Our Christian church has been ""remote"" for several weeks now with Bible study groups remote as well. This is the best way to engage in your Biblical studies and devotion at the present time. Both Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday will be unusual this year."
What happened to common sense? Just because the doors are open does not mean people have to go. The doors are open to the grocery store but I don't go there unless I absolutely can't live without something. I think God will forgive me for not attending church and I can pray at home. No need to endanger myself or others to attend services. Unless you live under a rock you know there is a major virus out there with the potential to kill people. The people who are still trying to go out and about are part of the problem. And my belief is that the churches should close their doors for the safety of the people rather than letting them believe because its a church God will protect you. I may be wrong but I believe all of the counties in our state and I am sure other states have the right to take action and limit people interaction. We should not have wait for an executive order for most of us to do what needs to be done. Stay home people.
You act like you are providing some kind of public service. No one is coming to TripAdvisor to get updates on the coronavirus. And all it does is bump down legitimate questions to regurgitate the same things over and over. It’s like a crazy obsession. Worry about what your own state is doing.
"Especially for spap, mojomo and SwimFan:I come with great respect for you and those of deep faith and conviction, and for those who may also be concerned for the immediate present with the contagion risks of groups. Your own support of and experience with ""remote"" worship, especially for the present, is inspiring.I believe there is no sufficient public health alternative to a state-wide requirement of closing secular, religious and other group facilities until the deadly contagion risks of the virus is resolved--and that this has been an approach in hurricanes, severe threats to public health, and other disasters used effectively and successfully in Florida over the years.. However, I understand the Governor has a different view. Thus as an alternative, the Governor could have re-affirmed respect for every person of sacred principle and devotion, provided information in supportive terms at the same time with his authority concerning what are also the secular implications of the group-crowd-virus issue, emphasize there are alternatives for personal worship and this situation is TEMPORARY--and in doing so, elicit cooperation and avert possible extensive human suffering in keeping with cherished respect for life. If the Governor had been willing to implement a tone and emphasis like this, he might have led and received more favorable response and press coverage than he has thus far--and elicited state-wide cooperation and solemnity. His approach could have acknowledged the importance of what he understands to be the appropriate separation of Church and State, and that we all share as One in the human condition. The second surprise Order supplement of the Governor was not in keeping with this approach.Given the frequency of effort to suppress my posts on the public health issues of state policy toward residents and visitors in this thread (later to be restored, which is appreciated), I am hopeful that spap, mojomo, SwimFan and others will see this.
