"I am going to be in Holland and surrounding area for 10 days the beginning of January. I plan on staying at the Stayokay in Den Hagg for the beginning of my trip and ending in Amsterdam (not sure of Hostel). I would like to bring my Laptop to do some necessary work during downtime, however I was wondering were would be the best place to store my laptop and other valuables while I am out and about exploring the country. Is the security lockers at most hostels large and safe enough to accommodate a laptop? ThanksAlso, if anyone has any “Must Do” attractions considering my itinerary, I am open to suggestions!!"
My advice would be: email them to ask. Don't just take the chance. Laptop theft is epidemic.
Would you consider staying at a reputile hotel? From such a location you would have peace of mind that your property is safe. I don't mean to discredit hostels in Amsterdam they are fun and all around at great prices -it would be bad luck to lose a computer
