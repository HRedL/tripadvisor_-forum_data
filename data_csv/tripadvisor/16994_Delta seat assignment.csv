"There's no shame involved. They didn't have seats available when you purchased your ticket. They hold some back at the gate for a variety of reasons. Like all airlines do. So you purchased a ticket, and they put you on a plane and got you to your destination. That's the way it works. If that's not a good resolution for you, I'm not sure what to recommend. Would you have preferred they double booked the seats and let you fight it out with the other passenger assigned to the same seat once you boarded?"
"My daughter flies Delta four or five times a year to visit us. She generally is not able to purchase tickets far in advance due to her work schedule, and she does not have status to permit her to select seats in Economy Plus. Accordingly, she always has to receive her seat assignments at the gate. I appreciate the frustration. They have a little boy and their only goal is to try and get two seats together so that their son does not have to sit between two strangers.As the previous poster indicated, this is common with all airlines. I make lots of plane reservations for an older daughter who travel extensively for business. She always books at the last minute, and it is rare when I am able to select a seat for her. She never flies on Delta as her loyalty program is with another airline. They have identical seat selection and boarding policies.If I arrive at my destination within a reasonable amount of time, and my luggage arrives with me I consider my flight to be successful. I never purchase a ticket with the expectation that I will have a guaranteed seat assignment."
Were you unable to select seats when you purchased? Your other post makes it sound like you waited until check-in to try to select seats.Edited: 7 years ago 
"And then they were! So....that's done, and they got you to your destination. Usually when you see that message it simply means they don't have any more pre-assigned seats to assign. Of course when you see that message you're free to stop the purchase and book with another airline, too."
"Being in Detroit (major hub of Delta) I fly them almose exclusivly. The only time seats are not shown as available is when everything but the seats they hold back for premium fliers are all taken. This typically happens when you book close to when you are leaving or near a holiday.They do overbook (not often) but generally there are seats when you get to the gate and lucky you, most were meant for premium passingers so you might get an exit row, economy comfort, front of coach or even the golden ride, first class (have only seen that once).Edited: 7 years ago "
"Forgot to mention, they have a new lowest fare class, ""E"" I think that does not allow you to preselect your seats. Sort of like the old standby fares."
"OP writes, ""we"". That may be a factor, as well. How many would ""we"" be?"
"Yeah, it sounds like you booked at the last minute? Normally you get to select seats for free at time of purchase, unless it's a late booking. BUT: you can always see what seats are available BEFORE you book, if you don't want to book a flight without knowing that you'll have pre-assigned seats. If knowing where you'll be sitting is that important to you, check first. (I travel with a baby, so I always check before I book to make sure there are two or three seats available together in a row that's appropriate for the carseat.)"

"Just booked a Delta roundtrip flight for the first time in memory. Expedia let us choose seats, but when the confirmation came, the return seats are confirmed, but the first flight says to check with airline. Went to Delta site and only seats available are upgrade. Am on hold to Delta now (quoted 3 hour wait!!!!!) to see what gives, but Googled to see what the general concensus is. Now I figure I'll be told seats will be assigned at the gate, even though we picked the seats out before purchase. My only real concern is if we don't get on the flight, our son's drive to pick us up is longer than our flight, so he will have made the drive for nothing."
"Will--after days of irregular ops and dealing w/any airline on the Sunday after a major holiday, you probably should try your call in a day or two. U nless your trip is imminent, I'd take of advantage of a better day for CS. (and be very nice about your waiting for them to get reg ops)Remember, you booked with a third party.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Thousands of passengers had flights delayed or cancelled due to winter storms yesterday. Customer Service agents at Delta are working over-time to try to get passengers from yesterday to their appropriate destination. Wait times today are not reflective of Delta's normal customer service response time. I always book directly with my airline. It has never seemed logical to put a third party between myself and my airline. Expedia may let you select seats, but there is no guarantee that Expedia's seat maps are up-to-date of that Expedia will successfully transfer your preferences to Delta. I do appreciate your concern. On those few occasions when I have waited for seat assignments at the gate I have always worried that I might not get on the flight. That has, however, never happened. I have always received a seat. It helps me feel more secure to arrive at the gate one hour before the flight leaves and get in the first part of the line for seat assignments. I did see two members of a family of four who could not get on the plane because it was full. They all came to the gate just as the agent was closing the door and printing her final passenger list. Their four seats had been given away when it was 15 minutes before take-off and they were not there. The gate agent managed to get the children on the flight, but the parents had to wait until tomorrow. So you can try to call when things calm down if you have time to wait. Otherwise get to the airport early. The previous poster had good advice. Treat the Delta employees in a respectful manner. The fact that you booked with Expedia rather than directly with your airline makes the whole process more difficult for the airline employees."
I'm flying cross the US on Delta in April - I just change our seat assignments for the 2nd time - there is no charge and I just moved us to the back - hoping that the seat between the 2 of us will remain empty - it's a red eye flight I did however book direct - Idon't understand why people book with expedia - just another layer to go wrong
"@IrishFan, Really?? No shame?? There is NO difference between overselling and double booking. Either way, it is a shady practice in that they intentionally bury these terms and explicitly expect the traveller to be ignorant to these scenarios. It may be ""legal"", but it is still shameful.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Hi,re: 17""Either way, it is a shady practice in that they intentionally bury these terms and explicitly expect the traveller to be ignorant to these scenarios. It may be ""legal"", but it is still shameful.""==> Wholly disagree. It is just one tool that they use to mitigate the risk of a no-show. I do think that IF tickets were like concert tickets - a one-time, use-it-or-loose-it situation, that this overbooking practice and need for it, would stop. But, so long as tickets can and often are changeable and such, overbooking will need to continue as they need someway to mitigate their risk of flying with open seats.I don't think you - as the consumer - can have it both ways... If you want that flexibility to be able to change or be re-accommodated on a later flight -- for whatever reason, then overbooking is the trade-off. The alternative really would be going to a point-to-point only business model and one whereby tickets would be of zero value after the flight has departed period.To a somewhat similar degree this is why some restaurants knowingly take more table reservations than they have actual tables -- because statistically they know some percentage will not show up, and that table then goes unfilled with lost revenue.. The only way to offset that is a non-refundable table reservation fee that would be used to off-set a no-shows dinner tab.If you don't allow for that, the result really ends up being higher prices for everyone else as a means of ""subsidizing"" the no-show factor.Travel Safe,"
"Not having a seat available to assign you at time of booking isn't the same as double booking. They release the unsold premium seats the day of the flight to flyers with status, and that frees up additional seats in the economy cabin for people who booked too close to the flight to be able to select seats. That's what ""no shame"" means."
Thank you for saying that Delta is charging extra for seating assignments in advance of the flight. No more booking tickets with delta if I can avoid it.
"photography4u, who said that? Some seats do have a fee, others do not. Read more at the Delta website: delta.com/content/www/en_US/support/faqs/pla… and delta.com/content/…preferred-seating.html"
"""No more booking tickets with delta if I can avoid it.""Eight years on TA, and this is your first ""contribution"" to the forums? No trip reports or travel advice for other readers?At any rate, Delta only charges extra for Economy Comfort - all other seating is available without additional charge, with some caveats. ""Preferred"" seating (such as exit rows and aisle or window seats toward the front of the plane) is often held out for status flyers. However these seats are usually released at OLCI and can be taken by anyone, as long as they are not previously assigned. Delta is actually one of the few airlines (or see it seems) that does *not* charge extra to select a seat.If you don't want to fly Delta that is your choice, but please make sure you are basing the decision on accurate information.-JimG"
"Same message for us and we're traveling with kids. For some reason they had no problem giving us seat assignments for the way home. Two ideas: 1 - They are trying to stress you into paying for seat assignments ""only $29 each for preferred"" 2 - It's a ploy for getting people off their cell phones and talking to gate agents again. Did the union push for this? Odd and certainly not customer friendly. I'm back with Travelocity or Expedia vs. booking with Delta directly."
"My dad and I had to make a sudden trip to Italy a few years ago and so we booked rather last-minute tickets on American and our outward bound seats had to be assigned by American because we fell into that group where yeah, we'll get seats but we don't know where due to their holding back some percentage of seat assignments. We lucked out- got bulkhead seats- because it was an international connection and the plane was running late due to weather."
"I'm having this issue today on online check in. I'd like to get the mobile check in, but cannot as I am not currently assigned a seat. I booked 45 days ago, but did have to make a change 17 days ago. This was the first time I booked over the phone. I've never encountered this before, I figured if I buy the ticket, then I've got a spot on the plane, nothing was mentioned in my booking that I'd be a standby passenger, had they done that I would have reconsidered making the change and come up with an alternative solution to changing my flight. I'm nerve racked now as I have a timeline, if my flight was cancelled or delayed due to mechanical issues, or weather, I get that, but due to overbooking the flight, man that is just frustrating. That should be made clear..... not all of us are seasoned travelers, and there isn't exactly a manual that comes with this and being an inexperienced flyer, this is causing some anxiety.So yes shame, maybe not on delta, but the booking person I spoke with, it could have been easily said ""sir to let you know this flight is an overbooked flight and a possibility of not departing on the scheduled flight could occur, you will be put on a standby list"" That should be required, I could then make an INFORMED decision to try calling another airline, another flight, another solution...."
"barlando, there is no union with the frontline employees (same w/their flight attendants).Edited: 5 years ago "
"Tim, have you read through this thread at all? The fact that they are not able to pre-assign you a seat does not mean that the flight is necessarily overbooked. There are a number of seats that the airline holds back from being pre-assigned so that they have seats available for their high status flyers who often book at the last minute. They will assign you one of these seats at the gate."
"I booked with Delta. I remember on their website, it does say that sometimes assignments may only be available at check in. I booked rather early (10 months early), and I had the option to choose my seats. They probably have a set number that can be assigned in advanced, some seats reserved for priority flyers like most airlines. I guess it depends how long in advance you book.I do see my seat numbers on our etickets and on delta.com. We'll see if those are our real seats when we get on the plane, I guess."
"The other thing that happens with Delta (at least I think it was Delta) is that they have Economy Comfort (think that's what they're called) which have extra legroom. You have to pay for those if you want to book them in advance, so if that's all that's left they won't allow you to choose a seat. They give them to people for free if that's all that's left at check in though. I'd also keep checking your booking, as I've had seats open up that weren't there when I booked. One time when I booked, the only seats for me and my daughter were probably 6 rows apart. Later I was able to move us to one row in front of the other. Still later, I was able to move us to seats together, all between booking and check in. The more often you check the more likely you are to see if seats open up."
"Im having the same issue today. I went to print my boarding pass for a flight tomorrow a.m. I booked the flight 6 weeks ago using Delta frequent flyer miles. My boarding pass says I need to check at the gate for seat assignment even though I chose my seats 6 weeks ago. I called the 800 # and they verified that I do have an assigned seat. Not sure whats going on, but hope I get to take off on time!"
"According to Delta's web site, ""Basic Economy (E booking class) is a value-fare option for price-driven customers. When you purchase Basic Economy, you will typically enjoy our lowest fare, but seats will be assigned at check-in and you will not be able to change or refund your ticket after the Risk Free Cancellation period."""
"I've just returned from my trip, and what Delta said was that there was a plane change from the time I booked my flight. My question is why wouldn't existing seats be transferred to the new plane before allowing new seat assignments be made? This seemed to affect about a dozen people. It seems like it should be an easy programming fix to transfer existing seats. On my return flight I had the original requested seat."
"you have no idea why the others had seat changes, do you? no way to guess and we sure can't either."
"The reason given to others at the gate, was that the plane was changed at some time."
"If you book their economy fare, you cannot reserve a seat, ever. Period. That's their policy. They will assign a seat at the gate. That's why I flew for 3 hours in a middle seat next to a very large person this morning while the person in front of me fully reclined their seat for the entire trip. If you don't like it, don't fly Delta economy. Which is why I will never fly Delta again."
"I have booked last minute with United and have always had a seat assigned - although it has been a few years. I usually fly SW now.Does this happen with United also now? Or most airlines?Being someone that is a bit claustrophobic, I will do anything to secure an aisle seat. Not knowing where I am going to sit for a 5-6 hour flight would put me in a bit of a panic, although I realize I would survive."
"I always book an economy fare on Delta, and have always been able to reserve a seat."
"""I always book an economy fare on Delta, and have always been able to reserve a seat.""Please see message 32. It's right from their web site. Perhaps this is new policy?"
"Not sure what the policy is all about, but the reason I fly Delta over a competitor is because of the free assigned seats. Scheduling, luggage and other fees are pretty much the same, at least for the areas I fly to."
"I am flying the return leg tomorrow and it shows as seat assigned at gate. I called them and they told me that if you book super economy, you cannot reserve a seat. Maybe this is a new policy since you last flew with them."
"It could be. If so, Delta will no longer be my preferred carrier. Good luck on your return flight!"
It sounds like Delta is giving people a choice: book regular economy and seat selection is free. Book Super Economy if you don't care about seat selection but want to save money.Here's some info: foxnews.com/travel/…Edited: 5 years ago

"TerriKS, not quite. I just did a test run on Delta's site for San Diego to MSP which is the itinerary that put me in the middle seat. For Coach fares they offered ""Main Cabin"" and ""Basic Economy."" Main Cabin pax get to choose their seats and board before the Basic Economy pax. The $ difference for a rnd trip is $80.By the way, it was my error to use the term Super economy. Delta calls it Basic economy.Thank you for the Fox News article. Perhaps the ""Delta Comfort"" fare is offered on wide bodies or X-country flights."
"At least on the delta website it seems they do a reasonable job of informing people _before_ purchase that there is no advance seat assignment for basic economy. Those fares are listed in a separate column and right at the top of the column it says ""Nonchangeable. Seat assigned at check-in. Limited Medallion® benefits."""
"I like the way that Delta is doing it as opposed to BA where everyone except those with status have to pay for seat selection when they book. I know that it really works out to the same amount of money, but I think that people feel like they have a more of a choice when it's presented this way. You can choose the bare bones fare, or the fare that gives you seat selection and a couple of other amenities."
>>Im having the same issue today. I went to print my boarding pass for a flight tomorrow a.m. I booked the flight 6 weeks ago using Delta frequent flyer miles. My boarding pass says I need to check at the gate for seat assignment even though I chose my seats 6 weeks ago.<<My dad and I booked seats in economy in March to go visit my sister and brother-in-law this past week and our seats stayed assigned both coming and going. Maybe because it was a puddle jumper?
"I have just experienced the same thing. It happens when we buy 'economy' fare. I purchased the flights through our rewards program, and, during the purchasing process, the only thing that showed about seating was ""Delta chooses not to share their seating chart."" It did NOT say anything about 'seating being assigned after checkin.""There have been others responding to try to make this look like a normal approach, and ""you made it to your destination, so be quiet.""For some of us, these flights are a special occasion: anniversary, first vacation in a long time, celebration of a daughter surviving and being released from care after a traumatic brain injury. The statements like that are cold-hearted, and I empathize with you.During the process of purchasing tickets, it is never disclosed that seats will not be available for assignment. This is wrong, and it is a means of coercion to sell tickets. Seems like a class action suit to me."
"Look, you live right by CVG. Why not go to the desk agent if you're not willing to call customer service? You bought with reward points--you mean Skymiles? There is a separate number for that CS dept. I'm sure they would have assisted if you had bothered. Why would an agent believe a story of any sort (congrats to your child's recovery)? BTW, if you think some people are ""cold-hearted"", empathy is not the correct word. No one here has had previous comment from you (or against you) regarding your situation. Lots of people have anniversaries and don't get vacations very often. DYKWIA comes to mind, regarding preferential treatment in your case. Sorry, but that is how I feel."
"Very good catch, mrcycling. Hopefully, we'll hear from her shortly."

"This did not ever used to be the case with airlines, I've only noticed it very recently. Last time it was American, this time Delta. When I inquired about the reasons, I was told it was because I used an online booking service (Kayak, Orbitz, etc.) instead of booking directly with the Airline, but I have always used Kayak, Orbitz, etc., and I used to be able to pick my seats and have them still there when I flew. I think it is one of those subtle ways a company makes it less ""pleasant' to use the service that provides a discount, thereby discouraging people from doing it. At the very least, they should tell you up front when you are booking that you won't get that seat, so why waste time picking it?"
Purchasing airfare from an airline is a contract with the carrier for transport not for a specific seat. There are many reasons that seats are held before deparure. There are actually some aircraft that have seats for disabed and handicapped pax which are not always booked in advance.More often than you know there are equipment changes within hours of a flight and even though it may be the same aircraft the internal configuration is not always the same. Having a pre-assigned does not assure you of any thing. Being on time does. Seeing an agent at the counter before you go to the gate is a good plan. Attacking the gate agents as they approach the podium is not. They have already seen their flight and know what they have to work with. they will do their best for you. Courtesy and patience go a long way.
"My business company books my tickets through Egencia, which is the business sister site of Expedia, and lets me choose airlines, including seats as I book. Generally I choose Delta because I think they consistently put safety first. They always let passengers know if there is an issue with a plane or if there is a reason for a change in plans, and I feel that they put safety before meeting schedules--and still have the best on time record. I have actually overheard pilots on other airlines--American to be blunt--discussing their frustration with occasionally needing to takeoff with aircraft which they think should be kept in for maintainance--so safety to me trumps all else. I have a frequent flyer number and considerable mileage built up. That said, this time, the weekend of many, many Spring Breaks apparently, I could not choose my seat on the final flight of my return trip--all others, yes, but not the final one.. I tried calling the phone assistance line on Egencia. I went to the airport early both directions and tried to get a seat assignment. Even in Atlanta I went to the help station and all they did was print out a boarding pass that said I would get my seat assignment at the gate. Even at the gate, they would not give me a pass which left me wondering whether or not they had overbooked the flight and I was going to be bumped at the last minute. Certainly the gate attendant appeared mystified until finally a second person let me know that yes, I would be able to board the flight and I would get my seat assignment as I boarded the plane. When I boarded and they handed me my seat assignment I understood why. I was seated in row 38 out of 40. My guess is that for the incredibly bad seats at the very back of the plane they give out those assignments as the passengers board so that they do not have to deal with those persons requesting them to check for a seat further forward. They just don't want to deal with it. In fact, everybody in the very back of the plane was murmuring how grateful they were to be on the plane at all. Everyone thought they were not going to make the flight. Quite the strategy. Let everyone feel uncertain, put them in really bad seats at the very last moment when there's not a moment to question anything and not only have they not had to deal with people wanting changes but many people with bad seats are just happy to have a seat at all. Tactically brilliant.I thought it was pretty awful. The only thing that made me okay with the whole situation was that there were high winds in my destination city with gusts of 45-50 mph. Delta pilots will sometimes bring the plane down in a slow spiral descent which takes longer but is smoother. If there's an aviation issue, I want to be on Delta. The desk people are remarkably unhelpful but their pilots are super amazing."
"""Delta pilots will sometimes bring the plane down in a slow spiral descent which takes longer but is smoother. If there's an aviation issue, I want to be on Delta. ""So air traffic control gives different instructions for landing approaches to pilots on Delta flights than they do on other airlines? That's...interesting."
Something is rotten in the planes of Delta!
"Shakespeare's Sis,I feel your pain. The *whole world* was on Spring Break and traveling these last couple of weekends could be trying. A lot of people to deal with but you would think airlines learn and have the know how by now.If they want to, they can make the process better.I think there were a lot of oversold flights, one of ours was and the ticket agent offered 300 USD/pp for voluntary denied boarding, no takers until she went to her limit of 500. The agent was so happy that she practically hugged the folks who volunteered.We got our seats but there were always someone on the standby lists on all flights and on ALL 4 of my flights the seats were 100% occupied. Of course they were checking carry on luggage for free as the planes were full. So here is a tip: if you have carryon luggage and would like to check it, don't, wait til you get to gate and chances are you can check it in for free. Save yourself 25$.>>Quite the strategy. Let everyone feel uncertain, put them in really bad seats at the very last moment when there's not a moment to question anything and not only have they not had to deal with people wanting changes but many people with bad seats are just happy to have a seat at all. Tactically brilliant.<<Well, I don't know if what happened was that purposeful, but creating fear, uncertainty and doubt in customers' minds can give someone ability to influence what you want them to do and think. The seating thing on planes is an example of that. I would agree that the flight crew are often the best of what is in aviation. I have not seen a significant difference in pilots' skills between different airlines. I think they all have similar training and requirements, with years of experience making the difference.We know what we are, but know not what seats we may be.:)"
Great closing line. Perfect really.
"If you buy your tickets on Deltas website it clearly shows you the basic economy, Main economy etc. and the pros/cons. If you don't then your problem is not with Delta. Just another reason to avoid 3rd party booking agents."
"Sounds like many are buying DL tickets from CheapOair, Bravofly, Opodo, and other 3rd party sites, and are not seeing the seat maps. Maybe complain to them?Hunt"
They sell all the seats on the plane. They hold back on seat assignments in hopes that people will upgrade to Economy Comfort at the gate. If a passenger who had a seat assignment upgraded they would have to assign them a new seat # and move people around.
"My theory or deduction is they are holding off on seat assignments in hopes that people will upgrade to Economy Comfort at the gate. If people do upgrade and the flight is full they wind up having to move people around. Example: on a hundred passenger plane (minus first class seats) with 16 Economy Comfort seats (16%), for sake of argument no one buys economy comfort at time of booking, then when the plane is 84% booked they will not let the last 16 people booked get a seat assignment or till they get to the gate. If 16 people upgrade to Economy Comfort then Delta cashes in on the upgrade fees. If only 10 upgrade then 6 lucky unassigned people finally get their seat assignments put in Economy Comfort the other 10 get empty seats left by the people who paid for an upgrade. So if you are unassigned you can look at it two ways, frustrated that you did not get to pick your seat or hopeful that you might get assigned a Comfort seat without paying an upgrade fee. My last flight they seemed to reduce the price of the upgrade at the gate to entice people to upgrade -- so there were no lucky passengers but I overheard that one couple only paid $29 upgrade fee for a 3 hour flight. Something I will definitely look for next time I fly Delta."
"Just returned from a short flight, which I booked 8 weeks in advance, arrived well ahead of the suggested arrival time and was assigned the pit-toilet, engine noise, worst seats on the plane row! This is the second time Delta has done this. The last time was a flight from Paris. This is not random or chance that it happened on consecutive trips. I fly often and no other airline has done this seating. Is there something I am missing?"
I assume you chose the cheapest fare that doesn't permit advance seat assignments...
"If I toss a coin 4 times and it comes up heads each time, can I say that it can't be random or chance? No, I can only say that the odds were against it happening, but it did.... or do you think the airline has you on some sort of ""give them the worst seats on the plane"" list due to some transgression (real or imagined)? That they leave those seats empty until someone on that list tries to fly?Fact is there are better and worse seats on a plane. People that have elite status with the airline or who are willing to pay extra get their choice of the good ones. People who are not willing to pay stand a better chance of getting not-so-good ones (reduced legroom, near a bathroom, etc.), but it is most definitely chance and luck. Personally, I don't care about that if I am not paying extra - I just care that I have a safe trip to my chosen destination and that the airline gets me there pretty much when they say they will. Because that is exactly what I am paying them for, nothing more. Anything else is a bonus that I am grateful for."
"<<<This is not random or chance that it happened on consecutive trips. I fly often and no other airline has done this seating. Is there something I am missing?>>>You must have purchased a Basic Economy ticket, otherwise you would have had the option to choose your seats when you purchased your ticket. So no, it's not random, it's what you purchased.From Delta's website:<<<Basic Economy (E booking class) is a value-fare option for price-driven customers. When you purchase Basic Economy, you typically will enjoy our lowest fare, but seats will be assigned at check-in>>>"
My solution is simple---I don't fly Delta. Their prices are not better and their treatment is poor.
"""Just returned from a short flight, which I booked 8 weeks in advance, arrived well ahead of the suggested arrival time and was assigned the pit-toilet, engine noise, worst seats on the plane row!

"It sounds like you booked an ""E"" fare ticket, booked late, or are traveling with a larger group. Or some mix of that. If you bought E class, that's why. You get a better fare but no advance seat assignment. For medallion status flyers, if you book that E class you get the same treatment and no chance of an upgrade. If you booked late, that's just a natural consequence if the plane is full. Sad you try to blame the airline instead. Not sure the shame belongs with them."
"Seat assignments continue to be a hot topic on this forum. Before booking, people need to be aware of the seating policy of the airline they are choosing to fly - can I pick a seat at the time of purchase? Can I pick a set at OLCI? Is it open boarding? Will there be an extra charge for picking a seat? Will some seats cost more than others? Are there seats together available on our preferred flights? If you know all of this before purchasing then you shouldn't have so many surprises - and complaints - about where you end up sitting. Planes simply are not configured to let everyone sit together or in a location they want. Some passengers will be split up, some will be stuck in the middle seat, and some will get the seats near the lavatory.There are a set number of seats on each flight and frankly, the airline really doesn't care who sits where or if people are sitting together or in a row they like. The airlines are simply interested in filling the seats."
"Flying this summer to Europe making reservations last fall. We went with comfort + seats on Delta for the extra leg room for my tall husband. Last night I looked under My Trips online and realized that Delta changed my seat assignment to a non window seat, basically the window is missing in that row of seats. SeatGuru calls it a bad seat. Not happy since I enjoy looking out a window. I called Delta and they said there was nothing they could do if we want comfort +. Frustrating since we made reservations so far in advance."
I know it's frustrating. The lesson learned here is to check your itinerary often. Especially when you book far in advance. Schedules and aircrafts change. It's possible you could have found a window seat if you had looked shortly after the change was made.Of course it's still possible a window seat could become available. Plans change. Keep checking.
"Perk - I have had seat assignments changed, sometimes because of a change in equipment, others for seemingly unknown reasons. I've learned to constantly monitor my reservations for schedule changes and seat assignments, as the further in advance you book, the more likely these things will happen. I feel you pain!"
"Perk - check back 24 hours before departure, that is when Delta usually moves lower medallions from + to first or business which frees up some + seats to move into."
"BarbP makes a great point - check reservations, and seat assignments often.Schedules can, and do change, as can equipment. I check weekly, and also have all alerts set for both e-mails and text, so usually get notifications, but occasionally, things fall through the cracks, so I check.As travel dates approach, I check those more frequently.A few years ago, my wife got bumped out of paid (no upgrade, miles or certificates) Global First Class, but we caught that 3 mos out, so time to find alternatives. No reason was ever given for that happening, and everyone (at UA) just scratched their heads - but we moved to flights out of LAX, instead of SFO, and all was OK. However, if we had not caught the problem, things could have gone pear-shaped in a very bad way.Always monitor all reservations, and seating assignments.Travel safely,Hunt"
"Thank you, lesson learned."
Same situation. I got a seat in the end but booked over a month in advance so why didn't I have a seat? When I asked at the gate the delta rep was extremely rude and abrupt. Horrible attitude. It's a shame to say a successful flight means I got there in spite of crap like this. I didn't purchase a Spirit ticket this is a MAJOR airline and a FULL PRICE fare. I may as well fly spirit or allegiance if I want this kind of service
"Just checked back, we were able to move. Thanks for the advise."
"Tis best to select one airline and garner ELITE status.If one is always seeking the ""cheapest ticket,"" there will be hassles.Flying is trying enough, and long ago we decided to obtain Delta Elite Status -- We always select our seating online at the time of purchase, and often do get an upgrade to First Class.Slainte"
"Wow, apparently this is a big problem with Delta.Last time it happened I didn't care, because they didn't let us choose our seats when we bought the tickets. No problem.But this time we paid extra for Comfort+ and we got to choose all our seats when we bought the tickets. I go to check in yesterday and all of a sudden my wife and I are seated separately on one of the flights and I don't have seats assigned on the other 3 legs of my flights. But my wife does have assigned seats (the ones we chose) for all of her flights...What is going on? Why is this becoming such a common problem with Delta? I've been flying delta almost exclusively for the past 5 years and this hasn't affected me at all until recently. Now its happening every time..."
"It's NOT a big problem but it happens--with other major carriers. Best advice is still to call the airline and politely ask about getting your seat assignments. Don't get huffy as that could put an agent on edge. (Applies to most customer service personnel). In a perfect world, all people get the best treatment from all humans...anyone can have a bad day and anyone can have a difficult situation to present...Edited: 4 years ago "
I purchased a ticket in advance through Travelocity. What happens if I get to the gate and don't get a seat?
"Laurie,Are you flying on one of DL's Basic Economy tickets, which only assigns seats at OLCI (24 hours in advance) or at the airport? If you are on a regular Economy ticket, is it that you didn't get to select a seat at the time of booking so you currently have no seat assignment? If you're in regular Economy (or higher fare class), have you checked your reservation on the DL website to see what shows and if there are seats available now for selection? The airlines hold seats for release at check-in at the airport, so even if the seat map shows no seats available, it doesn't mean there aren't. If you don't have a seat assignment prior to going to the airport then arrive as early as possible to be among the first to get listed for a seat assignment. At some airports you will see your name listed on an overhead screen as awaiting a seat assignment. Monitor that and check in with the gate agent.If the flight is overbooked, DL will ask for volunteers to take another flight and offer some sort of incentive to do so. If there are not enough volunteers, then some people might get bumped involuntarily, based on a number of factors such as fare class. Depending on your status, you could find yourself on another flight in an overbooked situation.Does that help at all?Edited: 4 years ago "
"I believe everyone would prefer having their seats signed ahead of time and trip well planed. According to your statement, the only other option is the airline double book the seat, which is not ture. The airline can simply be well organized and assign seat to each passenger ahead of time. If you believe this is not the case, please elaborate ""a variety of reasons""."
"One reason was already posted, you buy the cheapest fare ""E"" it clearly says you can not choose a seat ahead of time period."
"Are 3rd party bookers the only ones who can actually buy E class tickets on Delta ? I don't even see an option for an E fare when I log in and do a search on Delta. The lowest I get are V or X fares, which allow one to choose seats at the time of booking and the option to upgrade to Delta One."
"Oh, I see. I had just searched my normal trip to Prague, Cr, rather than a domestic trip."

There is a shame in this. Anxiety is justified especially on many an occasion I have arrived at the gate to find that flight is oversold!
I wasn't aware that there ere only 2 choices ie no assignment or double booking. How about the old system where they assign a seat fro free. What is wrong with that.?
"I'm lost as to how the only two choices for seats on DL are no seat assignment or double booking. As has already been explained, if you buy the new, cheapest 'E' fares (available only a certain routes) , you do not get to select a seat in advance. All of the other fare classes will allow you to select as seat assignment at purchase or anytime before the flight and yes, it is free unless you want extra leg room or a seat designated as ""preferred"". Preferred seats are those towards the front of the plane and exit rows. If you want a standard economy seat you will be bale to select one, but of course selection will decrease the closer it gets to the flight's departure. I'm not sure why there is so much confusion about this. UA and AA are also following suit with DL's low fares so that they may be competitive with other LCC's, who also charge for advance seat assignments. Therefore, when selecting your flights by price, you need to make sure you understand the T&C's of your ticket. You may have to wait until you get to the airport to get a seat assignment. You may not like it, but that's part of getting the cheaper fare."
Happened to me to. Someone claimed tickets from travel portals are not guaranteed seats on Delta. Bunch of crap! Might as well save the money and fly Southwest
"Jay B--NO seat is guaranteed on ANY airline. Many people depend on DL and other legacy carriers where WN does not fly. WN doesn't necessarily have the cheapest fares, but they do offer some nice perks like free bag, change fee, etc. Who is ""someone"", re: DL seats? Do you mean third party agents? It's in writing before you buy tkts, just like DL and E fares."
"So here's maybe a stupid question since you are clearly an expert....why let me purchase a ticket if there is no seat available? I get that someone might cancel but there should be some alert letting you know that...like ""swim at your own risk"". So yes shame on airlines for not being upfront. I have the same issue tomorrow and booked my flight two weeks ago. I'm on a very tight schedule and if I don't make the flight it ruins a business trip. But as long as the airline gets the money it's ok right?"
"I always check to see what seats are available for selection BEFORE buying a ticket. It might mean I select a different flight if I'm not happy with what is showing available, although for short flights it usually doesn't matter that much. Airlines will hold back seats for on-line and even gate check-in. I've looked at flights on the first day they are released and will already see seats marked as unavailable because of this. Actually two weeks isn't that large of an advance booking, as for major carriers like DL, flights usually become available 330 days in advance, so by 14 days out things are often quite picked over. I realize that when you are traveling for business it's not always possible to book weeks or months in advance, but that's the reality when it comes to seat selection. Just because there are no seats currently showing for selection doesn't mean you won't be seated on the flight.Edited: 3 years ago "

"kyshel - Bez just joined today and apparently hasn't yet realized that there will be a lot of opinions expressed in this forum, especially on hot topics like seat assignments. I can't quite recall anyone previously calling posts they don't agree with ""douche"", but I guess there's a first time for everything. A lot of people do make numerous posts, as they are quite active on the forum. How that leads to the assumption that people are being paid to do so or that they must work for the airlines is beyond me. Everyone has the right to express their opinion. If you don't agree with it, you're free to either express your own or simply don't post. Could a bad experience with DL (or any other airline) because of a seat assignment, have prompted the post?"

"<<<How offensive is post 110? WOW--no other comment--just WOW...>>>Totally agree. There is no comparison to being sent to the back of the bus because of skin color, despite paying the same fare as those at the front of the bus, to airlines recognizing that people will pay more for certain preferable seats. The poster also makes the assumption that people of color are always poor.I have sat quite happily at the back of the plane, and find economy seats to all be basically the same, though I prefer a window seat and will choose one whenever possible."
My seats w2re not assigned until I reached the gate and I purchased my ticket two months in advance.Edited: 2 years ago 
What type of ticket did you purchase? If it was the cheapest fare available (Basic Economy) then it doesn't matter when you bought it - those seats are *always* assigned at the gate.-JimG
"I purchased tickets weeks in advance. First time I could NOT get seat assignment. No I did buy 1st class, but it's not like I purchased lowest discount option either. I even pre paid for express boarding. Now at the airport, my wife and I have been assigned seats far apart. I am glad to learn Delta could care less about family or group purchase. We are cattle and the slaughter house doesn't care what order the livestock arrives. NEVER again, will I pay for a Delta ticket. Hundreds of flights, and have never felt so stupid or insignificant."
"So JJ you are saying you could not get an advance seat assignment at time of purchase or at OLCI? If you could not get seat assignments until you are at the airport (which seems odd) , then it is not surprising that you were not assigned seats together, as at that point there probably none available. It is impossible for any airline to give every passenger the seats they want on a plane and sometimes the only option is to split people up. That includes couples, families, and groups traveling together. It has happened from time to time with my husband and me. I don't see where having paid for priority boarding has anything to do with your seat assignment. Seat assignments are never guaranteed no matter how far in advance you paid for your ticket.I think referring to passengers as cattle and DL as a slaughterhouse is a bit over-the-top. Also because you didn't get to sit with your wife you felt stupid and insignificant? Good grief! Well, since this happens all the time, there is apparently a lot of ""stupid and insignificant"" people running around out there.Talk about being overly dramatic."
"#116 is just another in the epidemic of troll posts today from ""new"" one-post TA members."
"No I'm not a one post or a troll. If I post, I will follow (within reason). Have not had a flight, so wonderful, it deserved a special mention, hence no previous raves. I also had never been offered vouchers, before I had an option to print a ""special"" boarding pass, that has no gate or seat assignment.I will admit, the cattle analogy, was harsh, and maybe unfair. I consider my time valuable enough, to avoid doing business with companies that create a sense of uncertainty. I am aware of overbooking, and getting bumped. It is why I buy in advance, and pay for boarding upgrades. Still no guaranty, but greatly reduced odds... If doing those things, are not enough, to even create the illusion of a successful trip, then i cannot consider them a confident choice."
"""I even pre paid for express boarding""Did you buy this ticket at Delta.com? I have been a Delta customer for years, and they are a great airline - never heard of them offering paid ""express boarding"" (whatever that is). If you bought this from a third party site and chose the cheapest seats, then those were likely Basic Economy seats, which do not allow seat selection.Please clarify what you bought and who you bought it from. Without knowing that info it's really pointless for us to try and offer advice or comments.-JimG"

"JimG , I think JJ is referring to DL's Priority Boarding, which apparently can now be purchased as an extra. Here's the linkhttps:/…priority-boarding.htmlJ J, you state you are ""not a one post"". Then why was the TA post counter originally displayed under your post #116 shown as ""1 Post""? It has now changed to ""2 Posts"", as you have come back with a response. Are you implying that you have posted previously on TA but under another screen name/? That is the only way to reset your post counter.Apparently JJ you are under the impression that buying early and buying upgrades guarantees a ""successful trip"". They do not. Neither DL or any other airline is going to guarantee anything with regards to seat assignments,smoothy boarding, on-time departures, an uneventful flight - things that most people would consider part of a successful trip. As I said before, if you did not have seat assignments prior to arriving at the airport, it is not surprising you were not seated together. Apparently you, and far too many others (based on the number of posts here on TA), are expecting an airline to move people around so you can have the seats you want. While this may occur on some occasions, the airlines are not going to create a game of musical chairs so everyone is happy with their seats. IMO, DL got you from point A to point B. That's really all that contractually you signed up for. If you had paid for upgraded seats and didn't get them, then you would be entitled to a refund of that cost, but that was not the case. This situation could have happened on any airline, so you may eventually find that none of them are a ""confident choice"".Edited: 2 years ago "
"I didn't book at the last minute - well over 2 weeks in advance and still couldn't select seats at the time of booking. I agree with the poster, this is frustrating and adds to anxiety especially when traveling pregnant - I would have reserved an isle seat if given the opportunity."
Can you choose your seat if you pay? I’d say at least half of the seats were preferred so not free when I did a trial booking on Delta yesterday.
"We purchased a ticket for my wife to fly American to Dallas. They were purchased about a month ago. We could not select a seat at that time. That's OK. Last night we went to do the online check in and still could not select a seat unless we paid extra $ (one of the available seats was 18A). I told her not to pay the money as they were obligated to give her a seat at the price she paid when we booked. She went to the airport, checked her bag and checked in. Still no seat assigned so she went to the counter and asked why? The lady smiled and gave her a new boarding pass at no extra cost. Seat 18A. I think this is just a way for the airlines to pocket more money and it is shameful. Delta does the same thing. They make you think you are possibly not going to get a seat so you pay the extra just to be safe. Its a scam."
"""just a way for the airlines to pocket more money""Assignments made at the airport are based on available seating. Probably when you checked in, they thought there was still a chance that someone would pay extra for 18A (or that it might be taken by a Frequent Flyer). At some point they decide that's not going to happen so they give the seat to whomever is next in line when they start assigning seats.Out of curiosity do you also complain at restaurants when you request a table for two, but they seat you at a table for four because that is what's available at the time? It's the same thing (in this case at least) with airline seats - no conspiracies afoot, just good old Supply and Demand.-JimG"
"Apples and oranges. But, yes, if I made a table for two reservation at a restaurant a month in advance and they gave me a table for four, I would complain. Had we paid the extra for the preferred seat (18A) when we did the online check in we would be out the extra $ and she'd still be sitting in 18A. In my opinion this just seems wrong. It also seems predatory, a lot of people will pay the extra because they think they won't get seated if they don't. And I think the airlines are counting on that happening.Edited: 2 years ago "
"""a lot of people will pay the extra because they think they won't get seated if they don't.""Surely your wife didn't believe she wouldn't have a seat on the flight unless she paid extra. Did she think she would stand?"
"I don’t think the wife was consulted. Her husband told her not to pay. She could, of course, have asked the airline what would happen if she didn’t pay to choose a seat. The answer would be that one would be allocated by the airline. Problem solved (not that there was a problem as far as I can see)."
"I can't see a problem either. There was a choice of whethe rto pay to select a seat or not. It was decided (by the husband) that they should not pay. So the wife got a seat at the airport. Apparently, though, it's disgraceful that Delta ever offered the chance to select that seat for a price.Personally, I'd be quite happy in that position."
"Actually she did and she was going to pay for a preferred seat until I suggested that she shouldn't have to. She is not as seasoned a traveller as most of you folks that post on this site. Most people aren't that savvy to how all of this works and again, I think the airlines are counting on that. Just my opinion."
"I think you guys are missing my point. As most of you know, when you go to check in online 24 hours in advance you can only select preferred seating for more $. Not other seats are shown as available. To the non-seasoned traveller (my wife) it appears as though there is no choice but to pay the extra. In my opinion that just seems wrong. Of course the airlines can do whatever they want but maybe that could state that there are still x number of seats available that will be assigned at the gate. Or maybe they could say that based on the low fare your seat will be assigned at the gate. Just something so that the traveller is assured that they will get a seat even if they don't pay the extra fee.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I don't know if Delta is still doing this, or maybe on just some flights, but when I in the past have looked to book a flight, one thing that comes up with the search results has been the opportunity to get details on the flight -- like type of aircraft, seats available,etc. I have used this as I like to know if there are aisle seats available before I book, at least on a long flight. I assume that if no seats are available or no seats without an extra charge are available, then it would show no seats availabe or a price would pop up when one scrolled over a particular seat. Did you or your wife look into this when doing the initial booking? It would be disconcerting if they were showing seats availble before you booked, then not letting you select one as soon as you have booked. In the past I have always been given the option to select a seat as soon as I confirmed the booking. Keep in mind that if that doesn't happen for you, have until midnight the following day (on Delta at least) to cancel the booking and get all your money back."
"Also, am not sure is clear to me whether your wife was on ""Basic Economy"" fare. There are no advance seat assignments for those. All at gate as I understand it. ""Basic Economy"" now comes up first of all the many economy fares offered."
"Yeah, I get that now. It would just be nice if while checking in that was brought to the traveller's attention. That would be reassuring."
"Good info, will look further next time we book. Thx."
"I think Delta may be getting negative feedback on the seat assignment thing. When I was looking at some flights the other day, when my results came up, I noticed that they had added something in prominent red letters, either :seat assignment incuded"" (above ""main cabin"" column) or ""seat assignment not inclluded"" (over"" basic economy"" column) I assume because not everyone is getting the message on what is and is not included in ""basic economy."""
"Yeah, you can definitely get nicer seats on Basic Economy but I wouldn't bank on it. My dad and I did basic economy from TUS to MCO through Houston and from Houston to MCO we got 24 A and B on a full flight (I'm guessing a last minute cancellation). The other three flights were the last row or the next to last row and we were not seated together."
"If you book and pay on Delta but don't realize until after you've done that that you've booked ""Basic Economy"" i(no advance seat assignment) instead of ""Main Cabin"" (advance seat assignment) keep in mind you can cancel your booking until midnight of the following day and get all your money back. However, it would probably be better to slow down when doing a booking on Delta or any other airline and make sure you understand what is or is not included in your fare, esp. for things that may be important to you. Almost without exception, the first (cheapest) fare you see in your online search results is going to be a ""basic"" fare that does not include many things that used to be included in the first (cheapest) fare you saw in your search results just a couple of years ago."
"I've got return flights between Glasgow and New York and just logged into my flight booking as I'm trying to sort out API forms and have discovered that Delta have split up my return flight seating which I done ages ago. Our flight from Glasgow is fine, 4 seats in the same row but our return only has 2 together with the other 2 being split into singles further up the cabin. Any ideas how or why they've changed it as I can't fix it as seems to be no other seats together on the flight."
"You could call Delta and ask them. It could be something like a change of equipment or it could be higher status flyers came along and took your seats, or it could have been they needed seats together to satisfy obligations to someone traveling with a small child or children. I have been moved like that even when just me flying alone. They don't seem to have any obligation to notify people of changes like that. Call and ask them why and if there's anything they can do about it."
Not true you have already paid. Some of these posts sound like paid airline employees. You should get your seats assigned at the time of payment! If they don't do that you should have an option to cancel your purchase. Period!!
You get the message after you have purchased the tickets. You should get that message before purchase! So you can opt out and go with another flight or airline. Some of these post sound like paid airline employees. You either have a seat for the price I am willing to pay or you don't! I shouldn't not have to wait till I get to the airline to discover that. Period.
Well I always expect to get exactly what I paid for. And no it does not happen all the time on all the airlines! More travelers should be more demanding and concern with the treatment of the airlines period!! You sale a seat only to find when I arrive that in fact I have no seat . BS. That's doesnt fly for me friend sorry.
"Basic Economy states when you go to purchase that you cannot pick your seats, Harold. It's plain English so I'm not sure why you're getting all up on your high horse over it."
"Harold T - Delta certainly does not assign seats at time of purchase. You have the option of selecting your own seat for free then or anytime after you have purchased your ticket. If you don't do this, you risk not getting the seats you want and/or sitting with other members of your party. Other airlines may not allow you to select seats in advance unless you pay a fee. If you don't pay extra, then you have to wait until on-line check-in(OLCI). In the case of the relatively new Basic Economy fares, you do not have the option of selecting a seat in advance or at OLCI - they are assigned at the gate.Seat availability is available before you book and pay for your ticket. Each flight shown will have a link to the seat map so you can check availability to see if there are seats together if you need more than one or in locations you like. If there aren't seats to your liking, you can simply look at a different flight. This is not information that is hidden until after you book and pay for your flight, so I'm not understanding your<<You get the message after you have purchased the tickets. You should get that message before purchase!>>.You seem to be forgetting that no seat assignment is ever guaranteed - something the airlines make quite clear in their T&C's. Yes, it is annoying and frustrating when the seats you have selected in advance are no longer available without any explanation, but it happens. We usually book seats well in advance and I periodically check them to make sure nothing has changed, especially if I have received a notification that there has been any kind of schedule change. By monitoring my seats on a regular basis I have been able to re-select other seats when our original selection has changed. If you wait until you are doing OLCI, it may be too late to move. Let's be realistic. It is impossible for the airlines to seat everyone in the seats they prefer and always with the people they are flying with. Some people are going to be disappointed in the seats they get, especially the nearer to the departure date that they book. We have had it happen a few times, but we get over it. We're usually just happy to get where we're going with no big issues - we don't consider not getting a great seat and/or even sitting together to being one."
"Sometimes GA's anticipate that the overheads will become full prior to all passengers boarding the plane, so they will be proactive and gate check bags to avoid delaying the flight's departure time while baggage is trying to be stowed away.As for your seat assignments, were you on a Basic Economy ticket? That would explain why you ended up towards the back of the plane, as those are less desirably seats and usually among the last to be selected or assigned. If you were on a regular Economy or higher fare, why didn't you select your seats for free at the time of booking?"
"I quit flying Delta 2 years ago, because of this. I bought main cabin tickets, selected my seats and paid for priority boarding. When I got to the gate, my seat was reassigned to the second row from the back. Having priority boarding, I was the firstt to board the back of the plane! I've since gone to Southwest and have never looked back! I even still have enough Delta miles for a free flight! The worst customer service I have ever experienced."
"Had you checked on your seat assignments between booking and the day of your flight? I've sometimes found seats have been changed after booking but since I monitor my reservations regularly, I caught it while there were still other decent seats available. Did they give you an explanation as to why your seats were reassigned?"
Is this a serious complaint? You got your seats reassigned once and as a result you start to fly a carrier where you can never get assigned seats? Come on....
Just checked CJketts profile and all 7 of his/her posts have been on just this one topic - issues with DL seat assignments. Guess they just can't let it go! LOL
"I do understand the change from Delta to Southwest. I used SW a few times due to the lower cost, but stayed with them after experiencing loss of assigned seats with both Delta and United.I know it doesn't make sense to some, but I am an anxious flyer when it comes to where I am sitting. I would rather pay $15 and KNOW that I will get an aisle seat rather than have to keep checking my seat assignments, calling if I cannot change them back, or deal with being told that my seat will be assigned at the airport. I have had to deal with cancelled flights, delayed flights, etc - and that I can deal with. What I cannot deal with is booking a seat well in advance, and then having to “babysit” that reservation and deal with whatever changes may happen. (And for the the person who said “or it could be higher status flyers came along and took your seats, or it could have been they needed seats together to satisfy obligations to someone traveling with a small child or children.”, I take issue with that because if I have booked, I should not be bumped because someone with higher status wants my seat. Also, if a family is booking, they would be able to see at the time of booking that there is not space together. Obviously, the airlines cannot know WHY I booked that seat and WHY it was important for me to have an aisle seat - but if I booked it, it is because I wanted it.)If you expect one thing, and get another that is less than satisfying, you are disappointed. With Southwest, I only expect an aisle seat, which I have always been able to get."
I completely agree with JEM4258. There was not just one incident with Delta. This happened multiple times and decided enough was enough! Not sure why BarbP and Jay1676 think they know so much!
"CJKetts - Back in June of 2015 you complained about your seats being reassigned because of a plane change ""at some point"", which you might have detected prior to your flight if you had been monitoring your reservation, thus giving you time to re-select seats. At that time you also declared that DL was no longer your preferred carrier because of this, so why still complain about it more than 3 years later, especially if you stopped flying DL 2 years ago? The original post is 5 years old.JEM4258 - The point is that a seat assignment is never guaranteed , no matter whether you pay or not. Circumstances, including a change of aircraft, can result in seats being re-assigned. I agree that people should not be bumped because of families or other groups wanting to sit together, but sometimes there is a situation that requires it (possibly a seat for an air marshal, for example). If you don't want to ""babysit"" your reservation, then there's a chance you will not know of issues related to your flight (including seat changes) until it is too late to try to rectify them. This is hardly a situation that is unique to DL or UA. As for always getting an aisle seat on SW, you've been very lucky. What will you do if you don't get one, as those too are never guaranteed?"
Amen n ditto. Drlta sucks
"BarbP - I am very aware that seats are never guaranteed. And I have seen those that have been chastised for not ""babysitting"" their flights regularly to make sure there have been no changes. Infrequent flyers are not aware of that - and I did not know of it until I read it on the forums. I have learned so much here, but we need to remember that most people do not fly regularly for business or pleasure. I have never had to do that with SW - just check the day before to see if there are any changes, and then the day of to make sure it is still on schedule. I have flown SW for at least 10 years and have always been able to get an aisle seat. I do, however, do the EB when going to Vegas or anywhere that I think I may not remember to to check-in at the 24 hour mark. I have always been in A or B."
"“I often wonder where this rumor of higher status flyers getting people bumped out of pre-assigned seats comes from.”============+1. I’m pretty high up with United and the only times in the last 14 years I’ve been “bumped” were due to an equipment change. And in both cases I’d checked, seen the seat change and nabbed *better* seats than I previously had (one of those was 2 days ago). And I used to be a FF with Delta and never had an issue with them either. Stuff does happen. There’s the pesky federal air marshals who can show up and demand a particular seats, and the airline cannot (by law) tell you that your seat was given away to a FAM. And yes once in a while the reservation system could have a glitch and cause an issue. JEM4258 I appreciate your needs and how WN suits you. It doesn’t suit me as I can’t be guaranteed to check in exactly 24 hours before departure and get the priority boarding (or whatever WN calls it). The fact that DL/AA/UA still allow free advance seat reservation at booking is good for people like me, and it’s a dwindling “benefit” globally."
Delta's seat assignment system sucks. No better word describes it. Pay for a seat before check it; at check in it's free. Things like that make me not use an airline.Jerry
"I'm just reading through this thread while waiting to board our Delta flight; I looked it up because, like the original commenter, we were told at check in that our seats would be assigned at the gate. We were the first passengers at our gate and when we asked the woman behind the desk for our seat assignments, she said to wait for our last name to be called. Another attendant took our boarding passes from me, so I asked him if the whole plane needed their seats assigned or... ""No there are only 13 of you, so..."" He trailed off as he turned away, and I was more confused than ever. As this is an anniversary getaway and we are keen to sit together, after 20 minutes while other passengers arrived, I eventually went back up and waited in the line of passengers voluntarily checking their huge carryons (for free - smart people, they waited for the courtesy checkin at the gate when the flight is fully booked to save the $30 bag fee). When I got to the desk I politely asked the computer attendant for the status of our seats, explaining we haven't traveled in the States for a while and the no seat assignment is new. She was very kind, explaining it was just that we booked an Economy Class E ticket (the lowest), and those get assigned at the very end. Then she handed me two boarding passes with seats next to each other, remarking that it doesn't always happen that there ARE adjoining seats available in Economy Class E. Overall a pleasant experience once I had the situation explained. Very thankful I get to sit next to my husband on our anniversary getaway!"
"Carolyn B,I’m glad it worked out for you and Happy Anniversary. What you booked (“Economy Claas E”) was Basic Economy, the cheapest fare intended to compete with the low cost carriers. And one of the restrictions of Basic Economy is no seat selection at all, and you get what you’re given at either check in or the gate. I reckon you (eventually) got a very nice agent. And the agent is right. Get what you’re given means precisely that. If all that’s available are middles ten rows apart that’s what you get. If you haven’t flown the return then be prepared. Had you booked directly with the airline this would have been explained loud and clear with a pop-up (that you have to acknowledge before proceeding, and that comes up when you select the fare. All three of the major carriers now have Basic Economy (with United not allowing a full size carry on on domestic BE fares). So in future be sure to check the fare you’re buying and book directly with the airline. Have a great trip."
No that happens when you check in For your flight. Already payed for. No refunds.
"I agree. Delta makes s’est assignments impossible to figure out and they actually lie to people about it. On December 7th I booked two main cabin tickets from Minneapolis to Paris. When I tried to reserve seats, it didn’t work. So I called them in order to make the seat assignments over the phone. I was told that seats were not available for reservation at the time and that I should call 45 days prior to the trip to reserve seats. It made me mad, but what can a person do? A month later, I called on a lark to see what would happen if I tried to reserve seats. This time I was told that all of the free seats were already booked except for a few single seats here and there. She said if we wanted to sit together we had to upgrade to Delta Comfort to the tune of $100 per seat. I complained and told her about them saying I could only book seats 45 days in advance and she just said she didn’t know why someone would tell me that. On a nice vacation to Paris for our anniversary, of course I want to sit with my husband! So, not seeing any other choice I paid the price.A few days later I called customer service to complain and ask for a refund since I was misinformed by one of their employees. No dice. I’m stuck. I did wangle 5000 points for each of us, but no monetary refund. This time I was told that more free seats do in fact open up 45 days ahead and when I was told the free seats were gone, that meant “of the seats we HAD released to date, the free ones are gone!” I’m so angry with Delta that I’m gong to use another airline next time even if it means making one or two stops!!Edited: 1 year ago "
"With the introduction of Basic Economy fares both domestically and now on many international routes, what is included in the fare has made booking tickets tricky. You have to be very careful that you are not booking Basic Economy if you want to get advance seat assignments and also possible bring a carry-on .The rules are not the same between all airlines and therefore you must check before buying you tickets to make sure you know what you are getting..If you booked a standard Economy fare on DL, it is odd that you could not pick your seats at the time you made the reservation and paid. I'm currently looking at some DL flights for June and can see the available seats on the set map before even filling in the passenger info. If you are flying on some airlines as part of some sort of package (land tour or cruise) those tickets are not usually purchased by the cruise/tour company until 45 days ahead of time, which would coincide with the 45-day time frame karge mentioned. When you actually get control of your reservation in Manage by Booking/Trips seems to be different for different airlines. For two trips where we were booked on UA we had control soon after the reservation was made by the cruise company . For an upcoming trip in November, AA assigned seats when they made the reservation but won't allow me to change them. I called the cruise company to get them changed while there was still a good selection, as all of the assigned seats were adjacent or one row from the bathrooms. This whole seat assignment process is getting out of control, as more and more seats are getting blocked out as Preferred seats and seats for Elite flyers, especially aisle seats. I don't mind a few bucks to reserve a seat but having to pay almost $100 each to get two of the seats that are in a section of only two on a plane with a 2-4-2 configuration is a bit ridiculous. Otherwise you are stuck in the two middle seats of the 4-seat section, as most of the aisles have been blocked out for Elite flyers. Maybe you can still get those aisle seats at the last minute if there aren't enough Elite flyers, but for a 9-hr flight I'm not risking it."
"I agree with #167 that at time you are looking at fights on DL website it will let you see available seats. I always check that to make sure there are plenty of kind of seats I want before booking.However, once last summer after I did this, booked main cabin seats, then went to select seats, website told me no seats available (except 1st class if I wanted to pay more) on one of the 2 flights (even though minutes earlier had shown me practically empty coach section). I was enraged and tweeted about it. I was contacted almost immediately by DL and assigned seats for both my flights.If DL had not contacted me or had not offered a satisfactory solution, I would have simply canceled both flights, gotten the full refund I am entitled to when canceling within 24 hours, and started all over again with either DL or another airline. I would never wait 30 or 45 days or any other period for a seat assignment. I get it at the time of booking or I don't go.You need to be very very careful when booking coach these days and make sure you don't book ""basic economy"" if you don't want to live with its restrictions."
"What I object to, is not being told at booking through Expedia that the flights I booked are Basic Economy fares.All Expedia said was that seats would be assigned at check-in. Indeed, for one of our flights, two seats were assigned to us, together in the same row at check-in. I was able to pay extra to get seat assignments in advance for our two return flights - I understand the fare differences.What worries/scares me is that no matter what I do, I can't seem to determine if there are actually available seats on this flight. I booked the flights three months in advance, yet my sister-in-law, who just booked last week, already has her seat assigned on this flight. Perhaps we'll get lucky and all be assigned in the same row (that would be nice!) but I have a feeling that my wife and I will be separated on this flight - not fun when you are partially handicapped, as I am."
"No I expect them to tell me at the time I purchase a seat, give me the option if I want to fly under those terms. Thats what I expect. Nothing more or less. If they can't do that then I won't buy. If you fly on there term good for you. When I fly I fly on my terms, my cash my terms. Or don't fly. Next airline!"

"If they don't have seats available, they shouldn't be selling tickets to fly! I think some of the people defending the airlines must be paid to do so! No I don't expect then to double book! And I don't expect them to sell me a ticket either! If there are no seats! Period!"
"Harold, you just don't get it, do you? When & whether you can select a seat depends on the class of ticket you've bought. If you book basic economy, as clearly stated on Delta's website, your seat will be assigned at check-in.Nobody's saying there are no seats available, just that you are not able to select a seat. If you want to select your seat you need to book a higher, more expensive class of ticket.Edited: 1 year ago "
">>I think some of the people defending the airlines must be paid to do so! <<Harold T: Seriously, please go find a new hobby! 3 of your 5 posts accusing forum regulars of being paid to post positively about an airline!!! Maybe the fact is that it's just not the version of the truth you'd like to read?"
"Have any of the people complaining about not being able to book a seat in advance called DL for an explanation? As been stated, if a BE fare was purchased, advance seat assignments aren't allowed. If airlines hold back seats to accommodate BE passengers and flight crews needing to be re-postioned, then they have to have a cut-off for the number of seats that can be selected in advance. Another possibility is that tour companies may have a hold on a number of seats. There's a variety of explanations but anyone here is just guessing, so only DL can supply the answer. Harold, accusing TA members of being paid by the airline to post positive responses and defend them is really over-the-top!"
"I find that most online travel sites are disclosing the rules of basic economy fares. It's up to the user now to read the rules, and as most of them do not, they complain later. Expedia has a dropdown menu that says ""Rules and restrictions apply"" and the first option, which is ""Seat Choice"" says ""Not Allowed"". Similar for Orbitz. Also, when you look at the passengers who got seats assigned at the gate,in some cases they get far better seats than the ones they could have been able to choose. Airlines now have ""preferred"" seats for frequent travelers, some of these seats are held until last minute in case a frequent flyer books the flight, others are vacated by frequent flyers if they are upgraded to a higher cabin, in the end these seats are released for passengers waiting to get a seat assigned."
HaroldPlease just stay home. I think that's going to work out much better for you because your expectations of airline behavior are not realistic. It's not just Delta this is how ALL of the airlines work (except maybe Spirit. SInce I won't fly them for any reason I am not sure what their rules are)
"Harold, don't stay home, there are great reasons to travel. And don't stop voicing your opinion. We need different viewpoints.This seating thing has been manipulated, massaged any which way to increase the airlines' bottom lines and customers have the rights to give feedback on how they feel about it, even if all airlines follow each other's footsteps. The whole thing about making people wait to the end to find out where they sit is to increase the anxiety and demand so that they can sell seat selection in advance. The airlines are not so concerned with fairness. You could be selecting a seat for 25 dollars and then someone on basic economy ticket can snag an extra legroom seat worth 35 for nothing. Some people buying basic economy just want to know where they sit, even if the seats are in the middle. They want to know when they buy that they have assigned seats. It's not that they want to select the seats."
I def want to be able to pick my seat! I am a big person and can not sit in a middle seat! Not being able to choose your seat now when booking online sucks!
"I have experienced the same thing. Unfortunately, airlines are nickeling and diming everything they can possibly wrap their hands around."
"No shame on you for not understanding the terms of your fare when you purchased it. Sounds like you bought a basic economy fare which does not entitle you to a seat assignment until you reach the gate and may not entitle you to an overhead wheeled carry on either. These fares look great when they pop up, but when you realize what you are really buying, it may not be worth it. And no, I don't work for an airline. I used to be a travel agent and I am aware that airlines will do anything they can to squeeze a buck, so I make sure I read all of the small print about what I am am buying in anticipation that the airline will screw me.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Still beating this topic to death after 6 years! By now one should be aware that airlines have de-bundled things in order to provide cheaper BASIC fares. What used to be included in a ticket price now isn't. If you want to pick your seat, have a carry-on, have a checked bag or bags, have even a snack - it may now come at an extra price over and above the cost of just purchasing a seat somewhere on the plane. It's buyer beware, so make sure you read all of the T&C's before you hit BUY."
You are booking on Delta and don’t understand that you can’t book your seat when you pick a basic economy fare it’s because you are honestly trying to not to understand. They throw up a big alert telling you what the restrictions are and offering you the chance to buy a higher price ticket that includes seat assignments I even saw the same type of thing on Expedia this week. Maybe you should read before you hit purchase
"I disagree. Planes have limited seats. You pay for one seat when you buy a ticket. If they have a seat, they need to assign it. I recently flew with my son, we were both given seat assignments when I paid for the tickets but during checkin online, my son's status changed to ""at the gate"". My son happens to be autistic, and you can't imagine the anxiety that can induce for someone, irregardless of my son's situation. I believe there is shame. If the airline doesn't have room on the flight, say so and let me find a flight where I know I have a seat. Leaving it to the airline has left me cold and sleepless on many a night as a consultant. Airlines sell a service, if they can't provide a reliable service they need to state that outright."
"Chris - I suggest that the next time you book, at least with Delta, you check the ""special assistance"" box when you do the booking, then they will ask some more questions and make arrangements for further communications. I have had the experience with Delta of being moved a couple of seats in one direction or another between the time of booking and actual flight. Normally this didn't bother me. But a couple of years ago, because of an injury I'd had, it was important to me not to be moved at all from the seat I'd chosen. So I checked the special assistance box and when they later contacted me I explained what had happened and what I needed (not to be moved) and they said fine, not to worry, you won't be moved. I imagine they would treat your need to be sure you were sitting next to your autistic son in a similar way.One other thing, I have seen posts on this forum from people who say seat assignments had been changed or withheld because of random selection for extra security screening at airport. This has not happened to me and I don't know if it is true, but I suppose it's a possibility in your case.Finally, I suggest you write to Delta telling them how upset you were about this, having thought your seat selections were firm, and see what kind of explanation you get."
"Chris, I’ve had contact with Delta special assistance before. And this year I flew twice with my adult autistic son with no issues with Delta.This is from an e-mail I received from Delta special assistance. “For future reference we’re committed to providing assistance to all people with disabilities, and I’d like you to know we offer a dedicated Disability Assistance Line at 404-209-3434. The agents who answer this phone line are devoted to helping with whatever the concern may be either before, during or after traveling with us”"
"<< Finally, I suggest you write to Delta telling them how upset you were about this, having thought your seat selections were firm,... >>Keep in mind that airlines don't ever guaranteet your seat selection. Seats can be changed for a variety of reasons, so you will need to see if DL will provide the reason for changing your son's. If you hadn't requested ""special assistance"", as mentioned above, they would likely not be aware of your son's autism."
