How look situation at Alicante? We habe flight on Tuesday and we wondering if we should go. Any advises?
Is the situation likely to be any worse than you home town/city?
The situation changes every day but you have the same risk as in the UK.
"Spain is now the second worse Country for the virus after Italy. Schools are shut. If it was me I would stay home, but we each have to make our own decisions"
"It depends where in Spain, in Alicante the situation is not worse than where I live in the UK. Madrid is much worse."
You are right. However it's escalating fast. The local town hall has closed all amenities. They have also started to panic buy here. You must know how fast this virus spreads. We will know in the next two weeks how this will go.
I have a flight today is I good to go or not ?
Bars and restaurants are open at home
Has there been a reduction in coronavirus since lock down?
"The coronavirus problem is still increasing. Hopefully it will be decreasing by the end of the year. We are still in lockdown. Everything is closed, including restaurants. You are not allowed to walk on the streets."
