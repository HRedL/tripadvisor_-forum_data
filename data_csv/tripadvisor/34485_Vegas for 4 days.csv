We are suppose to leave Sunday March 22 for Vegas and leave Thursday March 26th. Thinking it may be a peaceful vacation.
Have fun?
Good luck with that.
"It will certainly be quiet. Although it won't be a typical Vegas visit.Have you checked with your hotel today to see if they will still be open and accepting guests?Edited: 2:21 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Yes it’s still open. I have been checking daily.

"OP,Though things are changing hourly, at this moment, the list of what is open, and running, is likely much shorter, than the list of what is closed down.I would keep checking with the hotel, to monitor their situation.Best of luck,Hunt"
#13. Thank you. I was thinking same thing. We may have to post pone. So far our flight has not been cancelled. And I have tried the last four days to call them and can’t get thru.
The Venetian and Palazzo have just announced closure as well in Las Vegas. You never mentioned your hotel but it would be wise to rethink a visit right now as our city has had new closures for several days in a row.Have you looked at CDC recommendations for Leisure travel right now.https:/…travel-in-the-us.html
"Not sure if this is a fake post or not (literally everyone else has cancelled their March trips), but most airlines have information about changing/cancelling flights on their website to limit the amount of calls they are getting. Most are offering no fees to change flights. Which airline are you booked with?"
We are to stay at the Flamingo. There is a group of us. Flying Allegiant. I was checking earlier and they are still taking booking for the dune buggy’s in the desert. It just blows my mind that I get called or moron or questioned because I just made this account and my first post. Apparently I’m the first one to ever have a first post. Smh.
“ It just blows my mind that I get called or moron or questioned because I just made this account and my first post”I think it’s more about your irrational decision to take a leisurely vacation trip in the middle of a pandemic when everyone is being urged to stay home. But welcome to TripAdvisor!
Irishfan... so you haven’t left your house?? Irrational decision how. Did I say I was going? I said were suppose to!! Apparently you can’t read. *TROLL*
It’s a bad time to travel. You might contract the virus then spread it around when you get back to Iowa.
Just reschedule. I just did that today. :-( I mean...almost everything if not everything will be closed...…
"I think you’re getting some blowback because of the last line of your post. Kinda sounded tongue in cheek. We are in the first weeks of a pandemic. People are being asked to hunker down to help stop the spread and instead of asking should I go, you say it might be a peaceful vacation."
