Some thoughts to ponder on. Here’s the link....Lynphdhttps:/…
better give my private jet a polish...
"Got room for a little 'un, MalDiva?"
"Yes, Dianna. It's quite a big one, with all mod cons, walnut veneer, exquisitely comfortable soft leather, reclining seats, and a butler. Also lambs' wool blankets and goose down pillows on the full sized beds, and a well-stocked bar. Plus a chef from each continent to ensure variety and choice of meals. And the toilets have integral automated 'bottom showers'..."
"Sounds no less than I am accustomed to. Just send me the itinerary and I will be there. May I bring Hubby as an accessory, please?"
"Room for a big un Maldiva, I swear I have put on at least a stone in the last 3 weeks. My stretchy jim jams are at the point of no return (I do have standards before you all comment, at 9pm every evening I do change from day-time jammies to night time ones!) Mr W will not be accompanying me so I can overspill into his seat if that's OK with you. He took early retirement last week (arranged several months ago) and is happy enough atm to take in the rural Somerset country side where we are lucky enough to live. Meanwhile I am going nuts with him opening the fridge door every 2 minutes and can't wait for a holiday (all my plans for family celebrations and surprise getaways have now been mothballed). So Maldiva, get that jet fired up pronto!"
"Woodpecker, between the hours of 9am and 7pm, PJs become 'loungewear.' I have walked the dog a couple of times in my loungewear, but people from outside of the village (that would be them there 'outsiders') have started taking their daily exercise in the surrounding fields and footpaths, which is cramping my style.We have space for Mr W as well if he wants/you want? Dianna, yes, of course. The more the merrier :)If need be we can charter a second. I can't promise it'll be quite up to the luxurious standard of MalDivaOne (possibly no bottom showering loo), but I am sure it'll be reasonably comfortable...Luckily Facebook's algorithm has decided I am the target market for such things and I have been served lots of ads for hiring a private jet for the last few months. To be honest, I am glad because before that I was getting mostly facelifts and Russian brides..."
"Maldiva, you've not mentioned the in-flight entertainment, I cannot sleep properly on a plane when I try to, however stick me in front of a 7"" screen and try and concentrate on anything other than ""50 first dates"" and that's me dribbling onto Mr W's shoulder so add a good selection of mentally unchallenging media to the transport and we're good to go!Funny you should mention the about FB algorithms, I don't know whether it's because I follow just about every baking, cooking and recipe page going of late but this past couple of weeks I am receiving loads of invitations to relieve me of ££ whilst I perform an exercise class with a select few others in a video conferencing type format. Now apart from the fact that I have no wish to inflict my derriere (which at the best of times resembles, when moving, several small children knocking seven bells out of each other behind a closed curtain) on Arina in Estonia, there is also the security aspect. Mr W has seen over the last few weeks the contents of his staff's studies, kitchens, dining room and garden sheds and is very wary of our artwork from our reception room at Woodpecker Towers being seen by all and sundry should I partake in such online exercise. I have told him that no-one is interested in his ""Dog playing pool"" or ""Tennis player scratching bum"" posters but to no avail so I am therefore having to take other measures. I am bringing the Lidl water hammock down from the holiday cupboard and reposing in it in front of the TV, out of date tube of Sour cream cheese and chive pringles in one hand and pina colada in the other watching Shameem and Shamaam at Amilla Fushi do their stuff whilst my upper assests socially distance themselves! Chin Chin! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOmOXVrQkEo"
We’ll get Robbie...and perhaps give Gary a call as well...
Mindless drivel.
"@Damien H, I am sorry that you felt the need to save your first ever post in order to criticise us. Yes, it may be mindless drivel, apart from the original post, but many of us on the forum and beyond are suffering in these really difficult times. Some of us have lost jobs, lost income, are going stir crazy, are ill or have loved ones battling this ferocious disease as we speak or worse. We all do our best to assist travellers as best we can and whilst most posts on this thread are only loosely travel based, I do think we should be cut some slack and allowed a little down time.In the meantime if you have a query we can help with, we would be happy to help. Just open a new thread and forum members will do their best to assist.Stay safe and Happy Easter."
"Is 'Mindless drivel' anything other than mindless drivel?I happen to know for an absolute, undisputable fact that there are people on this forum engaged day to day in caring for the sick, co-ordinating the national, regional and local responses and providing numerous vital services...and quite frankly if they wish to engage in drivel, mindless or otherwise, when they require some down-time, that is also their absolute right. What's more, these are positive people, raising morale and providing the services that are keeping the country running and who will help to rebuild 'normality' afterwards...luckily not the type of people who scan online forums in search of places to spread their own negativity."
"In fact, we'll probably get Gary and Robbie to sing a duet on the outward journey especially dedicated to those very people..."
Wow Sonos post is completely inaccurate For one the virus doesn’t seem to mind heat plenty of cases in hot countries for example AustraliaThe fact is until there is a vaccine (Not guaranteed after all the common cold is a corona virus ) we achieve herd immunity (70% of population have been infected and built up immunity (No guarantee as data not yet available on how long immunity will last or if the virus will mutate ) or every single case of Covid worldwide is eradicated ( No chance far too many people have it to track and trace )it will continue to spread. Unfortunately we are just at the beginning I’m afraid this will be going on for a minimum of At least another year.Many carriers show no symptoms so basic temperature tests at an airport are pretty useless Off course there will come a time relatively soon when the cost of the economy and social structure outweighs the cost in lives and for many people who are young fit and healthy the virus represents minimal risk. So ultimately we probably have to accept that 80% of us will get this virus and hope our health systems can upscale quickly and avoid being overwhelmed this will also include the Maldives Sorry to sound bleak but I’m just telling you the facts personally I can’t think of anything worse than being seriously ill in a foreign country so I will not be booking a holiday until the situation is under control probably a minimum of 2 years time.
"Good morning, Some interesting posts. Travel will change due to COVID-19. Booking priorities, higher demands of safety and hygiene, and guest expectations will all have a dramatic shift. What can resorts do now, to more effectively deal with this change? How do we transition into the new period of hospitality? I am sure many of our resorts would appreciate your ideas. Sunny regards, Jason"
"Hi Jason, Thankyou for your questions. My personal thoughts pre-existed the C-19 pandemic. Since our last visit to the Maldives, one of us now has an underlying health condition. Therefore, to make any return to the Maldives, I would be looking at selecting a Resort based on my confidence that they could provide adequate medical support to guests, should it be needed. Knowing the set up of the individual Resort islands and their distance from Male is one thing, but I would want to know the action plan and actual logistics of accessing medical care. Hopefully it would remain a “what if” scenario, but I would need to have the answers to be able to make an informed decision about booking a trip. Maybe this is something that potential guests already regularly ask you about, before making their choice. Please note that I haven’t tried asking the question myself directly to any Resorts, but that was my thought as soon as I saw your question. Lyn"
"Hi Lyn, Thank you for your response. You have a good point. Resorts need to innovate and adapt quickly. We need effective solutions. We are currently brainstorming and we are unsure what airlines and government will do but am sure some type of medical passport, pre-travel testing might be considered. Will testing have to happen before guests and staff travel? Will we need to tests all of our team on a regular basis? Will buffets become a thing of the past? Is a hygiene department now essential?What additional hygiene protocols must be put in place? Rooms and public areas. Social distancing. Will this continue? How do we adapt our resorts to this new norm? How do we make sure our spa experience is safe for all concerned?  Would be brilliant to get our forum regulars involved in helping our industry find solutions. Thank you, Jason"
"Hi Jason, these are all good questions, but IMO few of them are answerable yet. The reason the virus is a problem is that it is new...so the extent of the problem when it is established worldwide is not known. For example, it was never clear that this particular virus would be less of a problem in hot weather. Lots and lots of people hoped it would, and that became an ‘internet fact’ that didn’t come to fruition, although I understand the latest thoughts on that (also not yet proven) are that it is actually spreading more slowly in hotter countries, but not as slowly as people hoped- time will tell whether it is slower enough to be significant. I guess we’ll find out when we’ve lived with it for four seasons.And we don’t yet know if it it will mutate regularly like the flu virus. This will be important in determining the extent of any future problem. Again, we’ll know more when we’ve lived with it for more time.At some stage it will become part of the new normal - it’s just that, IMO, it’s hard to envisage that ATM. Remember the days when some countries wouldn’t let people who were HIV +ve enter? My guess is that next summer we’ll have a much better idea of where we are. In the short term, which I guess is what the question addresses(?)... it’s hard at the moment to predict when things will even settle down, and as the new ‘ normal’ is unclear, it’s hard to predict what steps may - or may not - be required. I’d say agility is key...and asking the question demonstrates some agility! I would add (to those resorts for whom it is relevant - not pointing at Jason, to be clear ), what they can do now is treat travellers with consideration and make their refunds, and pay their staff appropriately through the crisis. This will encourage people to visit them in future. Remaining afloat by leaving hard working staff and loyal holidaymakers unable to pay their bills (ie treading on individuals’ heads to keep theirs above water) is disgusting. The resorts who play fairly are those who’ll get my business going forward. Those who don’t will clearly never get a recommendation from me and I hope they struggle to recruit staff going forward and sink anyway. It’s in times of trouble that true colours emerge (applies to agents too). Oh, and personally I’d like to see the same hygiene standards maintained going forward whatever happens!I don’t imagine social distancing as it is ATM will continue into the longer term (and could see little point to it in resort after having sat in a plane for 12 hours, then stood in the arrivals hall for a couple of hours, then sat on a seaplane or domestic flight)...which begs an interesting question when combined with Lyn’s thoughts - is this going to be the era of the resort close to Male, and associated rocketing prices. People regularly ask about access to emergency care here - I’d like to see all resorts’ websites explaining their protocol, and what facilities they have in resort (including a defibrillator)."
"The problem is this is a Novel Virus that has a rampant infection rate hygiene would be impossible to implement at the required levels imagine staff having to wash hands every time before and after they touch an item for example how many staff touch a plate before it is served. As to medical facilities at resorts again impossible in reality it would require a fully equipped intensive care unit with oxygen and ventilator and highly trained staff to provide support or alternatively a fast medical transfer to a hospital with ICU unit.I really feel for the travel industry but I can’t see any short term solutions Other related issues will be travel & medical insurance policies that will simply exclude Covid 19 related coverThere may be some options in the future if a drug treatment is found that can reduce the severity or of course a vaccine becomes available. Perhaps testing in the future if they can find an effective test that gives results within a few minutes. Problems with all of these options is scale it will take a long time to develop, source materials, manufacture and distribute on the scale required."
"Jason - These are excellent questions about the right solutions. Unfortunately, we don't know enough about the COVID19 (and post-COVID19) dynamics to determine the best solutions. Specially, we don't know enough about (a) the behaviour of the virus, and (b) the behaviour of the economy. Both of these will have huge impacts on the measures that resorts take to make themselves attractive.For example, if Immunity Certificates become widespread, then requiring them will be a simple way to protect the destination and slipstream easily into the tourism workflow (many countries require certain vaccinations for entry visas). If, in the other hand, immunity from COVID19 is determined to have limitations, then a number of safety protocols will be adopted into every day life and those will be naturally extended to place like the Maldives.I'm not even getting into the economic dynamics post COVID19 which may have a significant impact on how the tourism industry functions (eg. if the airline industry contracts significantly, then maybe charters re-emerge as a popular arrival mode and that will affect marketing, pricing, packages, etc).Bruce, Maldives Completewww.maldivescomplete.com"
"Yes i agree with ""Bruce"" his statement. Just wanted to say on the hygiene comment. If it was not yet a rule, it should have been there from long time ago. And hygiene is not only depending on Resorts but also the attitude of guests. Even if a resort 100% sterile, a guest can make with 1 gesture a place not safe. Hygiene should be by now a world ""normal"". And not responsibility of 1 but of all. Well said ""Bruce"". All stay safe."
"Thanks Peter.And here's a proposal for new beachwear for the resort boutique (which combines Jason's discussion of post-COVID changes with the earlier ""mindless drivel"") - https://www.instagram.com/p/B-y3GlKjns2/Bruce, Maldives Completewww.maldivescomplete.com"
"Morning all, Hope you are all safe and well. Just to expand our thinking on hygiene. Hygiene has and will be of the utmost importance. There are several changes in the operation that I am alluding to on how far do we go, what can we start working on now whilst we are temporarily closed. Obviously we can not know the answer now as we are all still leaving about COVID-19 and a vaccine or cure would affect our reaction. I feel that the airlines and government will drive much of the change. All guest must sanitise hands before going into a restaurant or bar. Similar to the cruise industry standards. Menus not to be paper and shared. Salt and pepper on tables to be reviewed? Restaurants and bars to cater for smaller numbers, more space between tables. Buffets? No entry and exit doors on public areas toilets, unless they are automated. Public area toilets must have automated bins, soap pumps, taps and alcohol-based sanitizers in all villas and public area toilets. Five-star hotels would never have a cleaning log on the entry of public toilets. Will that change? Excursions, gym and activities to be completed with fewer numbers. Room check out and check-in times reviewed to all more cleaning time. Do guest want some of see cleaners cleaning where before, this was done out of guest sight. Do they want to see our checklist and quality checks? This is some of the questions we are having with our team to provoke further thought and to complete a measured response. Sunny regards, Jason"
Thank you for the laugh and your feedback. :-) I am glad we both have the same issue with public area toilets entry and exit doors. We will get moving on redesigning ours now.
"We don’t know what any new rules may or may not be when borders are opened, of course. Will we have to prove immunity either due to having had the virus and been tested or by receiving a vaccine or will a country be deemed safe enough to let loose their population? Whatever happens, I suspect, human nature being what it is, that after a short honeymoon period of ultra care being taken by guests things will then be the same as before.I would welcome some of the measures you suggest, Jason, particularly those associated with toilets and restaurants and pretty much agree with MalDiva's post above.Buffets have never been my preference. Coronavirus or no Coronavirus some people's grasp on what is acceptable when selecting food is questionable to say the least.Personally a cleaning log is not something I would be insisting upon. It only shows who did the cleaning at a particular time and not how well or who has used the facilities since and how. Nor do I particularly want to be watching someone doing the cleaning. After all I will be on holiday and want to put the real world to one side for my week or two. There has to be some trust in the training of personnel and their intention to do a good job.Anything which is left to the guests themselves, however, is pot luck. For example, in the early days of the virus at the end of January just as the incoming Chinese flights were banned, I was in TheMaldives and the resort had placed hand sanitisers at both entrances to the buffet restaurant. It was shocking how many people simply walked straight past or worse actually stopped and pretended to use the sanitiser! In the same way there are those minorities in all countries who think the lockdown rules do not apply because “ it won’t happen to them” or so they believe.As far as numbers on excursions and activities etc is concerned, will that not be determined by what the situation is when we are all released from our current lockdowns and able to resume our lives? Do we want to go on holiday when self- distancing restrictions are still in place and what is the point if we have travelled on planes for several hours and possible public transport, too. May not be applicable to those with private jets, of course!I hope that when we are all able to re-arrange our holidays that we can go and relax and leave current restrictions and fears and sadness behind. Meanwhile good luck to you and the Team, Jason, and to all the other resort staff who are “ stuck” in Paradise but still working hard."
"In regards to Amilla and doing some changes at the moment, may i suggest 3 things in the toilet that i know did not just bother me but other guests too:- lower the toilet itself, very odd when my feet do not touch the floor, never had that before in any resort.-Why is the washing basin at one end of the toilet and the towel to dry your hands at the complete opposite side?- I was never able to reach for the toilet paper while seated on the toilet so people come up with all kind of ideas where they could place the toilet paper roll instead"
"Morning ab, Great feedback and we will do what we can to add to this to the list. Very practical advice and you sound like your an architect. Again, thank you. Jason"
The latest thoughts from Sonu.....https:/…
Thanks for the laugh at the beginning of this thread. Haven't seen anything like it since 'A Typical Day' 10yrs ago.I think the report in your last post Lynphd is a tad optimistic and desirable rather than realistic.My only ray of sunshine in all this is that the reefs will be amazing having been left to rest. Maybe it's time to return to holidays for keen divers. Pristine reefs have been slowly destroyed since mass tourism became the order of the day.I remember the Maldives first opening up to this and it was a rare place to visit though the cost being high meant I never expected to go but the quality of the islands was second to none.
https:/…
https:/… $1m... 50 friends and family only ... a fortnight... all inclusive... house wine only?
"""Maldiva"" in Amilla they do the same https://www.amilla.mv/residences-ownership In my mind maybe to go around the Visa story, as the Maldives government makes exceptions for investors.. https://avas.mv/en/82210"
A new article from Sonu:https:/…
"A worthwhile read and we need to find a way to reopen the economy with the least possible risk. Would agree that those closed borders are not economically sustainable for a great deal longer. Finding a safe way to do this will be the challenge and testing, testing and testing would be a good start."
"Yes it is interesting the new piece and opinion. In my view as soon one of the big airline carriers (KLM, Turkish, Emirates etc) start to fly on Maldives, the Government will follow fast on that (With the suitable health restrictions) . I can not imagine that resorts reopen (With staff, Services etc all running) without the possibility of enough guest to arrive. Stay safe ..."
"The airlines wont make a decision on flying to the Maldives until the Maldives Government come up with a plan that enables visitors to visit in safety.The only issue I have with article like this no matter how well intentioned I can't help but feel there is a lot of self interest in it, but I shouldn't be supersized as this is how big business and Governments work with lobbyists influencing them."
