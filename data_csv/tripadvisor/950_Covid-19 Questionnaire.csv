"I was reading somewhere that upon entering Mexico that a covid-19 questionnaire had to be filled out. If so, is it possible to download this online?"
"As I understand the situation, passengers have their temperatures taken, and only passengers with elevated temperatures have to undergo a further examination which includes a questionnaire. I doubt that the questionnaire is online (but I haven't looked for it).Edited: 9:45 am, June 27, 2020 "
"I have a friend who just returned from Cancun. She had to fill out a questionnaire when arriving, but she did not have her temperature taken at the airport. She didn’t see anyone having their temp taken upon arrival and they were doing random temp checks upon departure. Her temperature wasn’t taken until she arrived at Unico."
"Is there a form or questionnaire regarding covid 19 you need to complete , when ""leaving "" to return home. Before you go through security. I have seen some posts , about an app or website with a questionnaire. you have fill out and show security before you can get your return flight terminal. Thanks"
"There is no form to leave the USA (at least at DFW) or to enter Mexico (at least at CUN). You may have to do a questionnaire if the thermal scanner picks up an elevated temperature from you on arrival, but it’s not SOP."
You will also be required to fill out a form of your flight is randomly chosen to be inspected. Then everyone on the flight must fill out a questionnaire. This doesn't happen every day but it has been happening.
"I just got back today, I had to fill out a questionnaire when arriving and a new one at my layover. No big deal just asked if you been exposed and such. 2 mins to fil out."
I can confirm this I just left Cancun today and you have to fill the questionnaire on your way back.
"Can confirm the DFW and Cancun statements, everyone gets their temperature checked by a thermal camera after passing customs. They are not coming and ask you to stop and then take your temperature, they are using a non-invasive method."
"People on vacation will absolutely lie about their exposure to prevent being tested and quarantined. It's unbelievable that at the very least, Americans aren't being required to test negative in the few days prior to leaving our highly infected country."
