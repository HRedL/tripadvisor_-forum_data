"Hello,from 21.03. we would like to travel one week to Cambodia and two weeks to Vietnam. Our contact in Vietnam has advised against a trip to Vietnam, which is extremely avoided as a European. Alternatively we are thinking about three weeks in Cambodia. Does anyone have any information about how things are currently going there? Or are you shunned as a European - like in Vietnam?Thanks a lot!Frank"
"There is one confirmed case in Siem Reap and the Government has closed all schools in SR as a precaution. Sanitation and personal hygiene are not to the standards Europeans are used to (or would like) but there have been no blanket shut-downs that might affect tourists other than schools at this point. It's a tough call to decide whether to continue with your trip but I seriously doubt you will be shunned - Cambodia is suffering terribly from the decline in visitors from China so all tourism will be welcome. It's whether the airlines are still flying that I would be more concerned about and whether your travel insurance will cover you in the event of further closures, flight cancellations etc that I would be concerned about."
"Frank, at the moment the Cambodian people will likely be fine with you. However, in your post you worry about yourself. You need to consider whether you might inadvertently be the one who spreads the virus to a country which at the moment the local population is almost entirely free of it. Locals are suffering from lack of tourism, but medical bills here can financially cripple families for years - assuming that the required healthcare is actually available. I would bite the bullet and delay your trip to when all this is over and you can enjoy Cambodia worry-free"
"Well looks like Cambodia is a no-go for you as well. temporarily baring entry to 5 nationalities, Germans included. It simply not a good time to embark on any international trip, as more and more doors are closing."
"Cambodia now has 7 confirmed Corona virus cases and probably many more as most people are not being tested.The visa and travel regulations are changing daily. As Ian posted, arrival by water is now barred at all ports/locations in Cambodia.Be prepared for a potentially longer holiday than you had planned on if you leave your home country. If/when you get to a destination you may have more trouble trying to return to your home."
"Looks like your trip won’t happen right now, but please, please try to reschedule when this is all over!"
"According to this, Cambodia now has twelve (12) confirmed COV-19 cases and another country has been added to the temporarily banned from entry list.https:/…virus-cases-now-upped-12-kingdomBest regards. Ian"
And this water shortage in some Phnom Penh districts is not going to help matters as far as citizens maintaining high standards of personal hygiene and hand washing goes.https:/…water-shortages-raise-alarm-ppBest regards. Ian
"The water shortage reason was given as:“We can supply 600,000 cubic metres per day while demand has now exceeded 700,000 cubic metres. We are about 100,000 cubic meters short,”With tourism down dramatically, both foreign and domestic, and some factories closing - why is the demand for water so high?"
Tourists who are still visiting Mondulkiri province are telling stories of being one of only a handful of people staying at every guesthouse and hotel they visit in all of Cambodia...And the buses that are usually full this time of year with 15 - 25 people per bus now often have only 3 - 6 people per bus.
"And to update, Cambodia now has 24 confirmed COVID-19 cases.Details here:https:/…Best regards. Ian"
