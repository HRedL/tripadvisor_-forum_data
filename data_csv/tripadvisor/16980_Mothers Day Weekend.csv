Hello! Before all the corona virus craziness I booked for May 9-11. I have not cancelled my plans yet. Is anyone else going at that time? I don’t want to cancel until a week before if necessary. What are your opinions? Thanks.

"We have cancelled all travel plans, until late May, and that trip is under close scrutiny.May?Likely not going to happen.Hunt"
We have flights booked.
Okay thank you! We thought about rescheduling to July but I am not sure if I want to do that just yet....
I'm switching from first week of may to first week of June. I'm still worried that wont be enough time.
"Well, as far as your flights are concerned, there's no need yet to change/cancel. It's likely better for you, in fact, if you hold off until closer to (as in, very close to) your travel dates. Things are changing at such a rapid pace, that the options airlines offer now are guaranteed to be different a week or month from now. We don't know what else you have lined up. Did you book refundable lodging, or...? I wouldn't expect to travel to NOLA over Mother's Day weekend, but I'd hold off on changing things until late April or early May. I'd decide then whether to cancel outright or rebook. Pushing it back to early June, like someone said, isn't going to cut it, imo.~ Colleen"
"I booked my flights with Southwest. They offered no fee for changing flights. I did book a non refundable hotel. If the epidemic gets worse do you know if I could dispute the charge with my credit card company if I needed to cancel. I just read a new article about the epidemic in Nola and it’s looking really bad. :-(Edited: 12:11 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Hmmm... tough call. That's still so close to the time frame of the suggested downtime. My son lives in NOLA & we canceled our Easter trip there but I'm not so sure that May is even a good time. For us, we are going to wait and see what Dr. Fauci & other experts say. It may be in the middle of summer before it's ok. Good luck & let us know what you plan.Edited: 9:45 am, March 27, 2020 "
"""I did book a non refundable hotel. If the epidemic gets worse do you know if I could dispute the charge with my credit card company if I needed to cancel.""No. When you book a nonrefundable rate, the terms are very clear. There's nothing to dispute with the cc company. You'd need to reach out directly to the hotel. Many are working with the customers, either extending refunds or allowing them to rebook.~ Colleen"
"Thanks Etude. Coleen, Thank you for your great advice."
"We will not be open by Mother's Day here in New Orleans. We are really just at the beginning here. Being from Washington, you should appreciate that."
The OP is from Tennessee. I’m from Washington and also gave the thumbs down to Mother’s Day in NOLA (or traveling anywhere imo).~ Colleen
my bad I missed that -
"No reason to cancel it now if you can wait until the week before, right?"
I was able to cancel the hotel and switch my flights. I preferred doing early to lock in the low prices. I already got travel funds from southwest because the flight dropped $26 each way.
