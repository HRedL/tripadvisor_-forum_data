"HiiI booked a holiday to spain about a week ago. and now im hearing about how there might be another lockdown there so i might need to cancel my flights if I feel its unsafe to go. I have flights booked with ryanair and a trying to buy travel insurance but I dont get which one to get. I saw 3 different kinds: Insurance:cancellation for unexpected circumstances (yes)ticket refund and gadget insurance (no)multi trip (no)Insurance plus:cancellation for unexpected circumstances (yes)ticket refund and gadget insurance (yes)multi trip (no)Annual insurance:cancellation for unexpected circumstances (yes)ticket refund and gadget insurance (no)multi trip (yes)Firslty, I dont unsertand the difference between ""cancellation for unexpected circumstances"" and ""refund"". which one would I need if I want to cancel my flight and get a refund? and secondly, i have 2 flights so I was hoping to get the multi trip one but it doesnt offer the refund. im so confused. which one do i go with?."
I don't think any travel insurance policy will cover you for anything claims that you make resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.If you booked your flights recently then you should be able to change them without fee to another date.
"Which travel policies are these? It's a bit hard to comment when you've not linked to the policy or any of the general policy exclusions.Unexpected circumstances usually relate to accidents, deaths etc which prevent you from going. You're not going to get an insurer to cover for cancellation because a country goes into lockdown. Covid is a known problem and you knew the state of play in Spain and the associated risks when you booked. It's unlikely they'd go into a national lockdown, regional maybe. The raised infection rates are due to outbreaks in specific areas."
"""I don't think any travel insurance policy will cover you for anything claims that you make resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.""A sweeping incorrect generalisation, for example in the UK you can get cover from Staysure for covid related claims although it wont cover disinclination to travel which looks like the OP is doing.https:/…"
"Insure and Go, who we use and have an annual policy has just written to us to say this:-For any trips booked under your current policy you will now have cover for Coronavirus related claims, unless at the time of booking your trip there is something to suggest that it is unlikely to go ahead.That is, of course, for a policy we had taken out before the pandemic (although up till now we were not covered).It's still a bit ambiguous since a suggestion that it is unlikely to go ahead, is a bit vague, and one they can wriggle out of.Maybe contact them to see what they say?"
"""there might be another lockdown there so i might need to cancel my flights if I feel its unsafe to go.""You might find an insurance company in the UK.But it will be some work from your side to check that they cover for a pandemic (some unfortunately do not).Then you need to understand the reasons the insurance will accept for your cancelling the trip. Then there is also a timing issue. If you conclude the insurance after a lockdown and/or other measures have been announced, you might be too late for them to cover.Then you need to check what they cover (flight, hotel, rental car etc.) and to which degree (100% or less) and to which maximum amount in total.Unless you find an insurance which accepts more or less any reason for cancellation, you will have to go through the small print and/or call them to check what they really cover.Important is also to have the coverage reasons in written. Words can be misunderstood and might be hard to proof."

"Some great up-to-date info on this thread, thank you Tom & Bella.I'm (tentatively) booked from 1st week in Sept and, like others, trying to make a last minute well informed decision. The 'insure & go' is a clear shift in position and a positve one that could well tip the balance.And for the OP, as others have said, Ryanair will let you change your flights and are waiving all change fees for imminent tavel, that is by far your best option. Insurance does not cover 'planned' events, it covers the unforseen, with caveats. Buying it because you might change your mind is not an unforseen event, and buying it after the surge means the cause is not unforseen either.Visit Ryanair and read through the options"
"@ FCB - the OP appears to be referring to the lockdowns in Spain, at their intended destination, giving cause for concern. We couldn't spell lockdown let alone implement one."
"As others have said, many travel insurance policies bought after the WHO declared Covid 19 to be a pandemic will not cover you for Covid related claims. If you find one that does, read the terms and conditions *very* carefully.Policies taken out prior to that *should* cover you as Covid was an unexpected circumstance at the time of purchase, but again, read the t and c's carefully.Generally it is not advisable to take out Insurance offered by Airlines and/or Tour Operator as they are often poor value, with the terms heavily weighted in the Airline/Tour Operator's favour.Edited: 7:48 am, July 19, 2020 "
"<< I wouldn't call the ""lock down"" that the UK imposed a true lock down. >>I think the OP means another lockdown in Spain, not the UK."
"I was looking through some UK-based polices for a friend and the limitations are more on the non-medical side. So you are covered if you get ill (including COVID-19) but not if a lockdown or travel restriction comes into force. This is usually restricted to journeys that have been booked since 13th March.Here is AXA's take on it:""If I buy a travel policy now, does it cover me for coronavirus?New and existing customers will be covered for emergency medical claims related to coronavirus in countries exempt from the current FCO advice against all but essential travel. Customers will also be covered if they, someone they are travelling with or a close relative (as defined within the policy) contracts coronavirus and/or if they or someone they are travelling with has to quarantine before their trip and cannot travel, so long as they were unaffected and able to travel at the time they purchased the policy and at the time they booked their trip.However, new policies or trips booked from 13th March* will not be covered against any non-medical cancellation or disruption, including lockdowns, FCO advice against travel or any other country’s advice not to travel there. For claims such as these, customers should arrange a refund with their tour operator and / or airline."""
"JBB, Leyland10,Noted, thanks. Post is removed."
"We have an annual policy through ""Insure and Go"" as well. In the light of their latest communication we've just booked a villa in Lanzarote for 3 weeks in November. If things go Pete Tong, it looks as if we will be covered."
"""it looks as if we will be covered.""It really depends when you booked that villa in Lanzarote. If you have booked before 13th March, then you are covered re. Corona related issues. If you booked after 13th March, you are not covered:""By 13th March 2020, following the World Health Organisation’s decision to class the outbreak as a global pandemic, we considered Coronavirus to be a known event. This meant that no cover was available for Coronavirus related events for any trip booked after this date, even on existing policies.""|https://www.insureandgo.com/help/coronavirus"
"As I said, our travel insurance was taken out before the 13th March and I expect that as Howard L has said they have one as well it was likely to be taken out before that date too."
"But although HowardL took out the insurance before 13th March, he has only just booked his November trip. Dubai Phil's post suggests he will not therefore be covered even with an existing policy."
"Insure & Go also say ""On 14th July 2020 we reintroduced cover for Coronavirus related claims under some sections of the policy. The level of cover available will depend on when you bought your policy.""I don't know which sections they were, but presumably Howard does."
"This is what my email saidWe’re writing to let you know about some improvements to the level of cover available for Coronavirus (meaning COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2), or any mutation or variation of these). Earlier this year, we wrote to you to let you know that we would not be providing cover for any Coronavirus related claims for trips booked on or after 13th March. We’re pleased to tell you that this has now changed and the restriction has been lifted. For any trips booked under your current policy you will now have cover for Coronavirus related claims, unless at the time of booking your trip there is something to suggest that it is unlikely to go ahead. Please check our FAQs if you have any questions about this. Seems to me that it means if I book a trip now, we're covered (unless there is something to suggest....) which is a little ambiguous."
"I booked a flight with Ryanair because they advertised free changes without change fee but I should have read the fine print. They only allow you to change one leg and there are several other restrictions that make their offer, well, not very helpful. I had to change my return by two days and still had to pay the change fee (even though my ticket was purchased in July and travel is in August). They’re very tricky like that. So no their insurance will not cover your Covid situation and you will not be refunded."
