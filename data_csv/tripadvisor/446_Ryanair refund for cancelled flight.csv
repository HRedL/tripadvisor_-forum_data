Get Refund button doesn't work and when you enter flight reservation number it says it is invalid. It is either a system fault or an avoidance tactic by Ryanair not to pay the refund.
It's a technical glitch. Try again in a day or two.
"And, that statement is factually based on what?"
"I'm trying to get refund for few days already. When I press refund button it says there is a problem with my reservation, when I'm trying to submit the refund form it says the booking ref no is invalid."
did you book directly with Ryanair or through a 3rd party?
""" When I press refund button it says there is a problem with my reservation, when I'm trying to submit the refund form it says the booking ref no is invalid.""As mentioned earlier, there's a problem with their refund page, probably due to the large number of people trying to request refunds at the moment. Keep trying (people have reported that requests sometimes do get through after multiple attempts) or try when there's less pressure on the system (i.e. during the night or early morning). There's no deadline for claiming a refund so there's no hurry."
directly with ryanair
Is a scam flight was canceled but they don't have money because Rynaair are out of cash. So They will be do whatever they can to not refund you anything. Flight was canceled you know that Rynaair know that. Unfortunately we cannot process your application for one of the following reasons: Flight has not been cancelled or delayed > 3 hours

"Hi there, did you ever get your refund from Ryanair? Our flight got cancelled on the 27th of March due to the coronavirus and we had the exact same problem as you when trying to claim our money back. They are still trying to get out of giving us the refund back even now."
">>> They are still trying to get out of giving us the refund back even now. <<<No they are not, they are overwhelmed by demand, at a time when they are understaffed. They have had to reduce the number of people working in customer services so that they can practise social distancing in the workplace."
https:/…2024.03.2020.pdfHave a read - what date was your flight scheduled for? - not what date was it cancelled - what date were you supposed to fly?
"Employee? Oh, yes they are. That is compl. B-sh, this kind of things are automated - cancelled flight = return payment sum to buyers. Rynair tries no to pay, end of story."
"Two cancelled flights, asked for refund via link several weeks ago.Got automated email saying busy still not got a refund weeks later.Will have to do a section 75 via credit card as can't get hold of anyone to discuss it.Nice one Ryanair."
"Just received another email saying that it's going to take a while to get a refund.Funnily enough that is for the 19th to 22nd of April flight, no mention of the flight that has already gone from 31st March to 7th April.Maybe refund for that is on its way or im i delusional."
Not just me then.Come on Ryanair starting refunding your customers you say you have the balance sheet to ride this storm out.So start putting your money where your mouth is.
Maybe they're monitoring the forums and are putting your claims at the bottom of the pile every time you slag them off! :-)
Knowing my luck they probably are. LOL .See what happens with my July flights to Corfu.

Not had a email mentioning that a refund will be given after pandemic over so will wait and see.
"I had 2 reservations cancelled at Ryanair. Both were more than a month ago. I submitted the refund requests. I sent some more emails to them and there is still no money. Today I received this voucher from them for one booking. I started the chat but in the last 2 hours there is no reply ...I found out that I am also entitled for compensation for one of the reservations, because they cancelled it less than 2 weeks before departure. That is an extra 250 euro / flight if I am right. I made complaints at several boards. I launched a descriptive note on passenger rights, email adresses, compensation etc. on a fb forum. Ryanair: you should have paid the reimbursement and the compensation within 7 days but you failed to do so. It is overdue by a month now."
21I suspect that compensation won't be an option if due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
"If you think you are entitled to compensation under the EC261 then I'm afraid not, as it has exclusions in it that kick in. You ARE entitled to a full refund, though.I doubt you will get much action by posting on boards. Ryanair are the only people that can help, and you need to know what you are entitled to (a full refund, but NOT compensation) and stick to your guns.There is anecdotal evidence on here that RyanAir are issuing full refunds, once they have cancelled the flights."
thanks for the reply.It is not vis major. They decided to stop the flights. They could have operated their flights further but they decided because of - obvious - economical reason. That is not vis major.
"I am thinking about issuing a "" European Payment Order"" against Ryanair since they failed to pay the reimbursement within 7 days. They do not communicate either."
"""They decided to stop the flights. They could have operated their flights further but they decided because of - obvious - economical reason. That is not vis major.""Whether it is or it isn't, the EC has explicitly said that cancellations due to corona-virus should be treated as extraordinary for purposes of EU261 compensation so you're going down a dead-end if you try to pursue this. The right to a refund still stands though."
"Having received a cancellation notice, I submitted an online refund request on 29th March. The online facility stated a refund would show in my account within 7 - 10 days. Subsequently had the refund request confirmed on their chat line only it would take up to 30 working days. They've now introduced the voucher scam so as to hang onto our money even longer. If you still want a cash refund you've got to go via their chatline - waiting 2 hours this morning before I had to give up and been on an hour this evening. They're not going to answer are they? As if we don't have enough stress to deal with. I really wish I didn't have to use them and will use other airlines wherever possible in the future."
"We refer to your correspondence dated 08/05/2020.We apologise for the cancellation of your flight FR7148 from Dublin to Vilnius on the 26/05/2020 which was due to the current worldwide COVID 19 crisis.As per interpretive guidelines on EU passenger rights, announced by the EU commission on cancellations caused due to COVID 19, this is now classified as an extraordinary circumstance and compensation does not apply under EU261/2004.We hope the above clarifies the matter and we have now closed your claim.Yours sincerely,Y. Zakhrestiian"
"This thread is about refunds, not compensation. Extraordinary circumstances are irrelevant to the former."
