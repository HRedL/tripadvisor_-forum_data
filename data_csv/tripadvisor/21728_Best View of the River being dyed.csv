Hello - I am visiting Chicago and land Saturday at 7am. Staying at the Hyatt Rivernorth. The plan is to drop off our luggage and head straight to the action!We are hoping to be downtown by 8:30am. By this time what would be the best area/restaurant/bar to go to? We are first time tourist and hoping to see the river being dyed. Any recommendations greatly appreciated!

"Maybe Bridges, the 2nd floor lobby bar, at LondonHouse?https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-…Also, several photos of the view.Enjoy,Hunt"
We always hit the steps by the Wendella office and then over to Billy Goat for our first round. Enjoy Chicago!!

"In case you don't want to bother with the link, or cannot access the Tribune website, Chicago has cancelled (or ""postponed"" as Mayor Lightfoot said) Saturday’s downtown parade *and* dyeing of the Chicago River, Sunday’s South Side Irish Parade, and Sunday's NorthWest Irish Parade (in the Norwood Park neighborhood)."
