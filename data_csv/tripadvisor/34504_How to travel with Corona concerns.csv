"I'm just thinking that whether we like it or not, another variable has been added to our travel concerns. Just thought we could create a helpful advice list for those worried about this virus -whether catching it or being quarantined. So here's a few pieces I've read so far. Please add if you think of anything.If you are taking life sustaining meds, bring 3 weeks extra (minimum)If you are young and healthy no big worries-but if you are possibly exposed, you could be a carrier-stay away from those more at risk for 14 days after your return.If elderly or if you have a chronic disease, know what areas and resorts have reported cases.Wipe the seat, seatbelt, food tray on the planeWash hands often.Don't let the media create hysteria-know the facts"

"You do know that nearly all viruses are spread person to person, right? That's why they are called viruses."
"How it's spread is not a sure, known thing. Most likely person to person.""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads""https:/…transmission.html."
"travltowhrvr, virus such as this one can also be transmitted via surfaces-more likely from hard surfaces such as doorknobs, elevator buttons, etc. Also possibly from soft surfaces. Viruses can live from a few hours to a few days on such surfaces which is why you disinfect things when there is a virus outbreak.Many people are worried about travelling, so I thought that creating a list of preventative measures and useful advice might be helpful."
<< “ That's why they are called viruses.” >>Huh?
If you did read the question right I had asked about immigration with the crowd. If you ever traveled there you would know it's body to body with also many Europeans.Oh and BTW droplets from a sneeze spreads 6 fix.My main question is I believe many people all over are cancelling which will make going through immigration smoothly
<< “I believe many people all over are cancelling which will make going through immigration smoothly.” >>Booked a flight for my wife and daughter last week. When we were first choosing flights there were 10 seats left on their flight. When we chose seats a few days later there were only four seats left.Not sure about people “all over” but doesn’t look like anyone from this area is cancelling. At least not for next week.
Great I have one more place to call then off in MayThanks
