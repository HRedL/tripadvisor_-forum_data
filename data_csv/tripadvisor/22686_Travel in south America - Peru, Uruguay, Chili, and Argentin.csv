"We are retired, good health with being used to walking quite a bit and want to travel to Peru (Machu PIcchu), Chile, Argentina and Uruguay in an approximate 14 day or more trip in late May and early June. We are flying from the western US. Does anyone have any recommendations as to which city is best to fly into from the western US? We are planning on making a circular trip to each of these countries. Any suggestions about best practices, places to see, places to stay away from, means of transportation and things to watch out for. Is it easy to travel between these countries? I realize this is a broad description but any help or practical suggestions would be appreciated. We like Airbnb places to stay and using the train and are comfortable with those in other countries. Any reasonable suggestions appreciated. We are seasoned travelers to some areas but this is our first trip to South America. Our budget is open, but not high end at this point. Thank you for any help you could give us. Delta"
"hi,its nice to hear you are coming down here, its very nice and interesting!have you contacted any agency somewhere? For example in Buenos Aires, there are many agencies that actually plan your trip within those countries, like Say Hueque or similar. Their main client is for example Vaya Adventures.do you enjoy mountains, rivers, deserts, cities? Please provide more info.Edited: 6:18 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"as for Uruguay - its a few hours (depending on the city you're going to) away from Buenos Aires, Argentina so this could be easily booked/done on your own or by your hotel. A day trip to Colonia de Sacramento or 1 night in Montevideo."
"My first impression is your ambitious wish list needs more than 14 days. Distances are great, you will fly between most of these destinations.Fly to Lima then fly or bus to Cusco. Adjust to altitude for a few days, stay and visit for 2-5 days..Back to Cusco- maybe fly to Santiago de Chile (don't know if this is possible to go direct or via Lima)Santiago is nice, Valparaiso is fantastic. You can get there by bus.If you have designs on Patagonia, insert that here.Or take a bus to Mendoza Arg across the Andes, explore wine country.Fly or overnight comfy bus to Buenos AiresSpend a few days in the beautiful city.You can take a hovercraft ferry to Colonia Uruguay for the day, or catch a bus to Montevideo, spend a few days, return to BsAs and fly home to USA from EZE.I'm thinking 3 weeks.."
"Four countries in fourteen days? Surely you are not serious? Allow a day to travel between each and that leaves 2.5 days for each country! I would strongly recommend sticking to just one country. Which one depends entirely upon your interests. If this is your first time to South America I would suggest Peru. Very diverse with some iconic sights. Cusco and the Sacred Valley is incredible and could easily fill 7-9 days. Lima is a fascinating city with the best food in South America. Maybe the jungle as a side trip, or Arequipa and the Colca Canyon Late May/early June is a perfect time and there is a well developed travel infrastructure. No mailing trains but a few ""specialist "" rides from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes (for Machu Picchu) and Cusco to Puno. Most travel would be done by bus or plane and is reasonably efficient. You may find some inspiration in the Peru section of our blog @ https://accidentalnomads.com/category/peru/As you have posted in the Argentine forum, I assume that must be high up your wish list. BA is great for a few days. It has some great restaurants, bars tango shows and cultural sights. Iguazu falls is one of South America’s most iconic sites (2-3) days. Salta and the northwest offers some dramatic scenery, great wine and food and is perfect for a self drive road trip of a week or so. Some info on our time there @ https:/…No trains worth considering. Transport is mainly going to involve buses which are very comfortable and efficient or planes - comfortable but notorious for cancellations and delays.I would forget about Uruguay, especially a first trip lasting just 14 days. Colonia or Montevideo is doable as a side trip from BA but I would not recommend it. Chile being very long, thin and with vast distances, would be a little difficult in 14 days but I suppose you could fly into Santiago and head north - Valaparaiso, Chile, Iquique and San Pedro de Atacama. Nice, but it wouldn’t be my first choice.You mention you are ""planning on making a circular trip to each of these countries"" . I suggest spending some time on kayak.com or Skyscanner.com to check out routes between those countries. I think you will find it not as easy as you may think and proably very expensive. May be worth checking out something like Lanpass with LATAM if you book your international flights with them."
FAR TOOOOOO ambitious for 14 days!Stick to Argentina and have fun.ALL WE HAVE IS THIS MOMENT!
The area you are talking about spans half a continent. I dont know how you expect people to help you.Give us your preliminary itinerary and things you want to see and then people can make suggestions.
"Agree with crellston. Argentina is the eighth largest country in the world. Peru is the 20th largest. And Chile is the longest. You will be spending four or five days on airplanes to travel your proposed itinerary, and then two more days to travel to and from home. I also agree to just do Peru on your visit. It is a fantastic introduction to South America. That’s what we did (over 11days), and on our second trip we were more ambitious, traveling to Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Chile (over 18 days).Edited: 6:45 pm, February 29, 2020 "
Thank you for your message. We have contacted a few travel agencies but haven't made any final decisions yet. We do love the outdoors and are looking forward to seeing any sites near these specific cities besides Machu Picchu.
"Thank you for your information. We had read you need to adjust to the altitude in Peru so I may need to add a few days to that part of the trip. I was wondering if it might be too ambitious but would love to try to use one of these cities, either Santiago or Buenos Aires as a base. I was trying to get an idea of which one would be better so glad to hear about interesting sites near each one that would be worth spending time to see. I will give some thought to adding more days as we could do that."
Thank you so much for your input. I see what we were considering was way to much from the comments. I think we will just consider Peru since that seemed to be the consensus from most people- to just pick one and enjoy it.
Thank you as we would not want to spend most of the time traveling from one place to another. I think we will just pick one and get into the sites there - most likely Peru. I guess the others will have to wait for another time.
"Royal Dutch KLM do flights between Chile and Buenos Aries . It is very good service .we have just completed travel between these two countries lots to see and do. You will enjoy .Try and get a couple of days near iguazu falls , they are worth visiting"
"I agree with others that 4 countries is ambitious for two weeks (though I definitely understand the desire to see a lot as South America has so much to offer!).Peru is fabulous and a great place to start. You could easily fill 2 weeks there if you want to include the Amazon, Lake Titicaca, the Colca Canyon or Paracas, but if you want to focus on just Machu Picchu/Cusco/Sacred Valley that would still leave time for another destination. There are a couple of convenient flight connections that might be of interest. The first is Lima to Calama, Chile (3 days each week) so you could experience the Atacama Desert and then perhaps fly home via Santiago to see a bit of that city and surrounding areas like Valparaiso and wine country. The second is Lima to Foz do Iguacu, Brazil so you could explore Iguazu Falls (which straddles the border of Brazil and Argentina) and depart via Buenos Aires to have a few days in that city.Just some ideas. Any of the countries on your list will provide a wonderful South America experience, but you’ll have more time to actually enjoy the places you are visiting if you limit moving around.Enjoy your trip!Jennifer Gillmore – Lead Consultant, Latin America – Travel BeyondEdited: 10:48 am, March 26, 2020 "
"Agree with the others on timing. That said, I visited Peru last year for 8 days (we were limited by time off work and wish I had at least 10 and could easily fill 14). We also visited Argentina and Uruguay this year and spent 3 weeks. We wish we had more time there as well and have begun to plan a return trip next year to see what we missed this time, I know this is a BA forum, but, If MP is high on your list - I would stick with Peru alone for 14 days. Go back to SA later and see BA/Argentina separately, with more time,Edited: 4:10 pm, March 10, 2020 "
