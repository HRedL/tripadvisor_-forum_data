How is Hobart being affected? We are due to visit and spend 2 nights there this weekend..
There are two confirmed cases in Hobart at the moment.Google ABC Hobart and or the Hobart Mercury for newspaper reports.That's TWO confirmed cases.
Thanks will do.
"On March 15th there have been 5 cases reported in Hobart and Launceston. Although low, a cruise liner that docked in Hobart would not let their passengers leave the ship in fear that just one case contracted would spread to thousands on the ship. Tasmania has not yet reached crisis stage."
Thanks to everyone for the info.
We were planning on heading to Hobart this week but will be canceling due to corona virus. Seems like Mona and the markets will not be opening so we will not be wasting our time and money. If these shut who knows what else will. Looks like they are trying to kill their tourism industry

Sharlene we are saving our health system. Your tourist dollars are just not important.
