Does anyone know how many cases of COVID are in Icmeler and Marmaris ?
"There's no data published in Turkey nor even any general discussion of what is going on for small settlements - we'd be snowed under with essentially random data - unless there's an actual localised outbreak (so we do get info on hamlets from time to time) which means İçmeler is out, and Marmaris is too. However, the daily incidence of new cases is currently about 0.56 cases per 100,000 in the overall Aegean region.Assuming that rate applies to Marmaris, which has a summer population of about 400,000 (though I would guess less this year), then 2 or 3-ish cases per day? Depends, really, on how many sick people from Istanbul are making their way down there...You can find this sort of info on this thread which I will update later when today's data come out: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293… (post 187 for my latest weekly comment)."
"I can, however, say that according to the latest news, Covid-19 is at below detectable levels in Marmaris sewage. :)"
thank you
