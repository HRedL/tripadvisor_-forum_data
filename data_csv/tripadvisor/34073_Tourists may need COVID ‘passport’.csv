"Operative world - ""MAY"". The situation is rife with problems - 76 hours with a negative test does not mean the landing passenger did not catch it within that time frame or ON the plane. Testing upon arrival makes more sense to me at least. Whatever they need though, I know I'll comply."
"I agree. A test result that is up to 5 days old is useless. Rapid tests are, from what I read, not reliable.  Something has to be in place because this island is gearing up for a May 31st reopening. I pray we’re ready."
"In alot of places, one cannot simply go get tested; there has to be a reason for the test (maybe travel could be a reason?). Not really sure how this works"
"uoftn you would be surprised how much testing has opened up in the past week. Probably 75% of the sites require a referral, but I think most people could find a free testing site within 25+ miles. CVS and other retail locations are finally starting up drive through testing. There are at least 8-10 free sites within 30 minutes of me. Quest Labs is offering it at many sites without a referral.We have 5700 cases and 480 deaths in my County. I was tested Friday. It would be quite easy for me to get infected in three to five days. Honestly, there has to be some type of testing upon arrival. Also, which Countries have the green light to enter Jamaica? Everyone?"
"<<<< Also, which Countries have the green light to enter Jamaica >>>>My reading of the news and the announcements by the Government, only folks who are residence of Jamaica, but stuck outside of Jamaica are allowed to reenter. They all must go thru a 14 day isolation that is mostly taking place in several resorts (the Bahia is one of them).I recall that diplomats can also reenter and I recall a story that they can bypass the testing and isolation."
"The whole process have to be fine tuned and all aspects must be covered . Undue pressure from wealthy hoteliers must not be allowed to override serious safety concerns . Yes, i would like to see the island open its borders but safety have to be of paramount importance . There is no point in opening a bit too early and have to put up with a very serious surge of cases afterwards . This would inevitability set back Jamaica for months or perhaps years . So, for those who have been waiting for the country to open please be a little bit more patient. It is thus much better to be safe than sorry ."
"""Also, which Countries have the green light to enter Jamaica? Everyone?""NONE at the moment. Repatriation flights for Jamaican citizens have been coming in and those passengers are under strict quarantine for 2 weeks."
I should have been clearer on that. Yes I know none. My question is concerning when Jamaica opens on 5/31. Is it open to all Countries?
"Wow Cebakes. What’s the population on your county. My province has 1.68 million and we have had 592 cases and 6 deaths. On another note, Canada and the US have announced today that the cdn/us border will remain closed another 30 days.....really makes me pause to think about those hoping to go to Jamaica in June and July. I am so worried about a massive outbreak in Jamaica as a result of letting people in from all over the world. Stay safe.Edited: 11:57 am, May 19, 2020 "
"We have about 566,000 in our county. We are a Western suburb of Philly. Probably 70% of the deaths were in nursing homes. The State has not shared the true stats of how many were sick in nursing homes. It did rage thru nursing homes. There has been zero issues in the hospitals. Its more concentrated in the Eastern half of the county in higher density areas, so its not like I lived or live in fear. Most people in the immediate area have been quarantining, wearing masks, washing hands, and safe distancing. We still go out and safely live our lives."
"I hope Jamaica is careful.I know I would be afraid if my Country Canada opened to the US .I'm to close to all the US big numbers.Last place I traveled to was Las Vegas after leaving UT and my grandchildren Then home through DTW.I'm out.Nobody can even supply masks , who the F_c_would travel now for fun?"
"I live in Connecticut, between Boston and NYC and we are the only US state not yet open although the ban is supposedly ending tomorrow.It is impossible for me to imagine flying anywhere at the moment. wearing a mask, as I do in public, for 4 hours to JA plus pre and post flight hours in airports and subsequent travel from there and to be worried the whole time about possibly getting sick??. No thanks not for me.Having been hospitalized in Jamaica once before I wouldn't want to even think about it now. That's just my opinion and hopefully anybody that wants to test the odds I wish well!!"
"john g,I too have needed medical help in Jamaica. To those who are thinking of going as soon as travel opens, please know that Jamaica is NOT a place to need medical help."
Jeanne. It’s good to hear that from someone with first hand experience. I couldn’t agree more.
Completely agree with you. No trip for us either. Add the fact that some Jamaican hotels are requiring face masks and gloves at their buffets. Simply no worth the bother.
"Jeanne and Jon , my husband totally healthy needed help once we where sent to Sav.I also have needed help , I was so lucky I was helped at the place I stayed more than once.It's hard to imagine getting 19 there :(TooCold hopefully your starting your spring :)"
Lorna. It hit 28 today so I refused to go outside until my work day was done. Way too hard to go back to my home office to work when the kids are laying out in then sun and the dogs are in the pool lol
"Too_Cold, we have half a million fewer than you in our county, over 8000 cases and over 500 deaths. That’s nothing, of course, compared to NYC where I know several who have died. It’s such a challenge in the U.S. with places being hit so differently. There’s a tendency for many in our areas with fewer cases thus far to minimize it. Maybe that’s human nature, but it’s hard to see people not taking it seriously or being willing to help protect fellow citizens just because they don’t know anyone personally who is ill or who has died. I haven’t heard similar rhetoric from Canadians, but I’m not as tuned in.It’s so good to see Jamaica among the 20 countries successfully combating the virus. Their proactive, protective response has surely saved scores of lives. I hope things stay safe."
"#11. Jamaica is very careful. We’ve had several communities on total lockdown due to the virus, we have to sanitize our hands before entering any business, and mask wearing is mandatory. Don’t wear it and you can be arrested and you most certainly won’t gain access to any business. We limit the number of people in businesses as well. We’ve been doing this for weeks... I’m afraid to go to the US where simple hand hygiene practices are not in place. I was talking to a US couple the other day who extended their stay another three months and have to leave in two weeks.. they are afraid to go home and want to stay here. They’re ticked because JA said no ( they don’t qualify for anything over the 6 mths) and are ticked at the US Embassy for telling them they can’t help either; they need to go home."
"Lol, Too Cold so glad your getting lovely weather :)Hi Mary :)I always appreciate your words"
"Iriestar, Not sure where your home country is, Jamaica? But here in America there is a huge divide on this subject and I don't want this post to be a starting point for political discourse on this thread. But many folks here in the US do not take the virus as seriously as it seems you in Jamaica do. Although you are on an island, which in of itself, it may be easier to control the spread, your government has placed serious restrictions in place that have so far worked in keeping the incidence of infections and resultant deaths to a minimum. What will happen in JA when the travel ban is lifted is anybody's guess. You can't survive without tourism but you certainly won't survive if there is an outbreak the likes of what has happened here!! God Bless us all!!"
I concur with with john g .Hoping Jamaica doesn't succumb to the powers that only consider money.
"I personally am taking it seriously, but I agree with john g. It has been difficult here in the states as we are getting such conflicting info. I am really glad that Jamaica has taken the situation so seriously. I know that tourism is needed and I know that many of us are anxious to return. I would feel absolutely terrible if I brought the virus with me and then passed it on to any of my friends in Jamaica. In my simple opinion, I am not ready to take that risk....not so concerned for myself but for the others around me. I am trying to help financially in a few households and I know that Jamaica will welcome everyone back with open arms once we all get a handle on this virus.We are scheduled to arrive on island 9/23/20. I am being hopefully optimistic, but in reality, I do not believe that travel will be a smart idea for the rest of this year. Stay strong and stay safe everyone."
A lot of wisdom on the site :)Blessings Jamaica See You Again
A lot of wisdom on the site :)Blessings !Jamaica See You Again
"Additionally, my passport is currently in renewal limbo, LOL. Received for renewal on 3/3/20 and the message continues to say ""reviewing your information"" So, I am obviously not going anywhere right now!"
"Jeanne W, thank you I just realized ours are both up this year !"
"I would get it started Lorna, LOL!By the way, it is good to have you back!"
LoL!I'll will :)Thank you it's nice to be back :))My IPad had been causing so many problems.I'm glad my duct tape is working once again .....I thought I was gone again Im only hooked up on my IPad
"John... yes, I live in Jamaica and I am quite proud of our PM and how’s he’s handling things. We do have some people who can’t take direction and they’ve been made an example of. They’ve been arrested and fined up to 1m jmd. That’s not a lot in US dollars but it’s a helluva lot of money to those acting foolish. We’ll see what happens when we open.. we’re still under a mandatory mask in public order and trust me, it sucks wearing a mask in this heat. So many places have turned off their AC to help combat transmission. We’ll get through this and we will welcome everyone with open arms... from a distance"
"Hopefully it doesn't happen, but considering everything going on it wouldn't be surprising."
"My concern with a COVID passport is even though you may have been tested, who's to say you then didn't come into contact with it and your results change since your test? It really isn't easy to get results quickly. St. Lucia started to require a negative test within 48 hours prior to landing and that didn't work, now they are shut down again. We need to go back to living life. I am in the herd immunity camp and believe it will not change the outcome continually staying at home. Other countries have proven that. I'm ready to go on my July vacation until someone tells me otherwise."
"you may be in the herd immunity camp, but jamaica has too many foreign visitors and too few capable medical facilities to be playing with anything like that. https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achi…What will it take to achieve herd immunity with SARS-CoV-2?As with any other infection, there are two ways to achieve herd immunity: A large proportion of the population either gets infected or gets a protective vaccine. Based on early estimates of this virus’s infectiousness, we will likely need at least 70% of the population to be immune to have herd protection. In the worst case (for example, if we do not perform physical distancing or enact other measures to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2), the virus can infect this many people in a matter of a few months. This would overwhelm our hospitals and lead to high death rates. In the best case, we maintain current levels of infection—or even reduce these levels—until a vaccine becomes available. This will take concerted effort on the part of the entire population, with some level of continued physical distancing for an extended period, likely a year or longer, before a highly effective vaccine can be developed, tested, and mass produced. The most likely case is somewhere in the middle, where infection rates rise and fall over time; we may relax social distancing measures when numbers of infections fall, and then may need to re-implement these measures as numbers increase again. Prolonged effort will be required to prevent major outbreaks until a vaccine is developed. Even then, SARS-CoV-2 could still infect children before they can be vaccinated or adults after their immunity wanes. But it is unlikely in the long term to have the explosive spread that we are seeing right now because much of the population will be immune in the future.Why is getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 to “get it over with” not a good idea?With some other diseases, such as chickenpox before the varicella vaccine was developed, people sometimes exposed themselves intentionally as a way of achieving immunity. For less severe diseases, this approach might be reasonable. But the situation for SARS-CoV-2 is very different: COVID-19 carries a much higher risk of severe disease and even death.The death rate for COVID-19 is unknown, but current data suggest it is 10 times higher than for the flu. It’s higher still among vulnerable groups like the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. Even if the same number of people ultimately get infected with SARS-CoV-2, it’s best to space those infections over time to avoid overwhelming our doctors and hospitals. Quicker is not always better, as we have seen in previous epidemics with high mortality rates, such as the 1918 Flu pandemic.i'm actually shocked that anyone would have the blls to say something like: ""I am in the herd immunity camp and believe it will not change the outcome continually staying at home. Other countries have proven that. I'm ready to go on my July vacation until someone tells me otherwise."""
