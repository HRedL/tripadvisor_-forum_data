"Thailand's Coronavirus statistics show a relatively small number of infected persons and an amazingly small number of deaths attributed to the virus.In Louisiana alone however, where the weather is pretty hot at this time of the year, there are something like 13,000 cases and around 500 deaths.Are Thailand's figures accurate/reliable?"
"I have wondered the same, but all the SEA countries numbers are small relative to EU and North America.I do think weather is a factor. New Orleans may be warm but not tropical like Thailand. I have read that optimal temperature for transmission is 9 degrees and that over 27 and the virus wilts.Also while it would be easy to suppress the total number of cases, a little more difficult to understate deaths. (are morgues full in Thailand?)Also worth noting is that Thailand has only done 25,000 tests, a fraction of western countries. (the worldometers website is now publishing testing statistics)Masks is another factor - it's now looking like all the supposed western experts are flip flopping on the usefulness of masks.Edited: 2:26 pm, April 06, 2020 "
"Yes the figures for Thailand are relatively low but they are the second highest among their near neighbours. I put it down to (mainly) the low number of tests being done e.g. Thailand has tested 359 people per one million population whereas the USA has tested 5,291 people per one million. As for the number of deaths there will be a lot of ""he/she was old"" and just died.By the way KhunBill the true UK figures will be far higher than the published ""confirmed"" cases as you can't be ""confirmed unless you are tested and people with relatively mild symptoms don't get tested just told to ""self quarantine"" at home."
"Louisiana is not a major destination for beach goers from the North.Biloxi/ Gulfport, Mississippi or even Alabama Gulf Coast beaches are more popular than Louisiana for beachgoers.Where are these LA beaches?"
"A few more stats:"" Analysis of how infection was transmitted between confirmed cases in #Bangkok & their close contacts showed that contact occurred mostly at:home (35%)*social gathering (21%)work (22%)a crowded place (16%).* In the provinces, this figure is 49% """
"- lack of testing- people dying but having their deaths recorded as something else e.g. common flu or their death not reaching whatever authority it is that reports the figures- many more people wearing masks than in western countries- temperature checks everywhere, every shop, every communal building- sanitiser everywhere and thais actually using it whenever they see itall will contribute to the lower numbersalso the virus could be less harmful to south east asian people. could be genetic or could be to do with environmental conditions e.g. higher temperatures which kills it quicker on surfaces etc."
"No countries are showing accurate figures because it’s not possible to test everyone. Some just make a better effort than others. Indonesia is showing similar numbers to Thailand but with nearly ten times the deaths reported. Indonesia has conducted only 42 tests per million population and Thailand 359. Funerals in Jakarta for March were 40% higher than any month since at least Jan 2018 (no reliable figures before that). Bodies are being wrapped in plastic for burial. Doesn’t seem to me that a hot climate is a big factor in keeping numbers low. Australia has tested 11,900 per million and that is still not accurate. Until yesterday you could only be tested if you’d recently returned from overseas or had been in close contact with someone who had. Now they will test anyone over 65 with symptoms. If you’re 64 and have symptoms you won’t be tested. Anyone know what qualifies you for a test in Thailand?"
That’s a good way to keep numbers down.
"""""Anyone know what qualifies you for a test in Thailand?"" ... being able to pay for it.""Daughter has full / free insurance, and she didn't bother getting tested. 13 of her friends and classmates did test positive.Same, no testing, goes with most 'minor symptom' cases of anything. Especially at the cost for most to get tested.She said it was like the flu, but a bit worse. Though no drama or anything drastic. As long as her breathing wasn't affected, she didn't see any need to go to the hospital. More like, too lazy to leave condo, since Uni teaching online anyway."
"This is self-explanatory:Louisiana: 512 deaths14,867 total cases 1,809 patients hospitalized 563 in need of ventilators 69,166 tests completed General public does not wear masksOnly seriously ill persons are hospitalizedSocial distancing ? Please google Mardi GrasThailand:27 deaths2,258 Total cases1407 patients hospitalized 30 critical cases 71,860 samples tested as of last SaturdayAlmost everyone on the street and in shops wears masksEvery single person infected by SARS-CoV-2 is hospitalized Social distancing"
"""Almost everyone on the street and in shops wears masks""In the UK we are told repeatidly that masks have no effect in contracting the virus at least. I don't buy Thailand's figures or China's come to that. As for Japan?Most of the figures look so far off I am not sure how relevant they are. I am puzzled by the figures for Germany. Very high number of cases but very few deaths but I think they might do far more tests.From the UK I am appalled by our figures, the extremely slow response, the complete failure to use the breathing space before it hit to be prepared."
"Germany have been doing a lot of tests - second in total after the USA and nearly four times as many as France who have done the third most. Thailand much less than Louisiana which will be a factor.The issue with face masks, as I understand it, is more down to how they are used than whether they are effective in themselves. That's why different countries are making different calls on if people should wear them.Surgical masks offer no filtering but are effective at preventing exposure to larger droplets. This is only when worn properly for short periods of time, not touched, refitted, reused, and disposed of properly, etc. N95 masks offer more protection by filtering out smaller particles but you still have the other issues and a potential a for a false sense of security to change behaviour.I've seen lots of people with masks take them off to drink coffee or put mobile phones up to their face to take a call, pull the mask down when hot, etc. We also have a supply issue right now so governments with stock issues are going to prioritise health workers rather than telling everyone to go out and wear masks all the time.Edited: 7:16 am, April 07, 2020 "
"Cam131999, the sad truth is that your government is lying. Just go to every ER in your country and look what the staff is wearing. The US CDC has already changed its mind and recommends wearing masks. The truth is that the UK government doesn’t have masks available for the general public and that’s why they won’t recommend wearing masks.And even more uncomfortable truth is that the UK doesn’t have another hospital beds for all the COVID 19 patients and the NHS sends sick people home knowing that the illness can deteriorate rapidly and it would be best if everyone with symptoms is hospitalized. The 11 factories in Thailand produce more than 50 million masks a months. And everyone who tests positive ends up in a hospital here and won’t be discharged until negative."
Chris you're right about not enough masks in UK but their effectiveness is down to how they are used. A lot of people increase their risk by using them wrongly.Lots of studies on this.
Rather ironic that the UK Prime Minister is now hospitalised with the virus having lectured us all on what we should and shouldn't be doing.
"The total # of cases is not really that relevant. Whats more important is the number of people requiring hospitalisation, relative to capacity. So far Thailand's healthcare system is not overwhelmed and morgues are not full, so even though their numbers may be understated they are still miles ahead of most western countries."
"""Germany have been doing a lot of tests - second in total after the USA and nearly four times as many as France who have done the third most.""This actually doesnt really mean all that much, as they might have tested say 20,000 people, but for a country that has 320 million people, thats a drop in the ocean in terms of tests done.When its broken down into a per capita testing rate, its actually not that brilliant at all.Top Three countries in a per capita (in a million) testing rates are:IcelandItalyAustraliaEdited: 9:35 am, April 07, 2020 "
"Psyvolt, you got your maths wrong. Germany does 100,000 tests per DAY, Australia 10,000 per day.That compares with total tests of 152,979 people in the UK until early April..."
"""That compares with total tests of 152,979 people in the UK until early April.""Which no doubt will not be achieved. People are keeping their fingers crossed for a vaccine. I am not keeping my fingers crossed about getting a vaccination in the UK."
"Out of curiosity Psyvolt, where did you get your figures from? I count us at 21st going off the figures in this list at this precise moment:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Faroe Islands are leading the pack at over 100KPM..... but that’s only five thousand odd."
"Australia has tested more persons per million than Germany has. The UK has done over 266,000 tests."
WHO changed their advice on masks today:https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak
"Chris, which bit changed? I've not read the whole thing but they are still saying: ""the wide use of masks by healthypeople in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks"""
I see they are mentioning advantages to wearing masks in certain circumstances but then identify the risks. We knew that already though.
"Who cares what WHO says.The statement contradicts itself. States 'healthcare' workers, assuming they are healthy, should wear to protect from getting infected and or spreading.Then says, healthy people shouldn't wear, because of shortage, and healthcare workers are a priority.Really .... so mush for classless society.Sick people should wear to prevent spreading. Incubation period up to 2 weeks, without fever or symptoms. So if healthy, then infected, you wouldn't know for up to 2 weeks, while you spread the disease, since not wearing a mask.Great F'g advise.Everyone wears a mask, and logically seems a better idea.If WHO would have done their job, with China's outbreak, we possibly wouldn't be in this situation now.But now, we are supposed to listen to them, and be 2nd class citizens, and not use common sense, because of their failures."
"Not Me, if you read and understand what they are saying it makes sense. Bottom line is that masks offer levels of protection when used correctly but most community people don't use them correctly, and can actually end up increasing their risk as a result.Trained health care professions do use them correctly hence that advice.If you have the virus then any barrier between you and others is preventative.Edited: 1:01 pm, April 07, 2020 "
"That would be the same with all. People who use motorcycles or vehicles properly vs people who don't use properly.So responsible people are suppose to put themselves at risk because of the irresponsible.Because some people are idiots, it's assumed we all are.That logic doesn't even work on a stupid person.Why I don't take advise from WHO."
""" If you have the virus then any barrier between you and others is preventative.""Call me crazy.... but ... mask = barrier"
"The WHO has been wrong every step of the way. They said it was wrong to try to screen at borders or shut out travellers from infected areas, that masks were not effective and neither was the antibody blood test (that produces a result in 5 minutes). Asian countries ignored the WHOs advice and western countries followed their advice. Now all western countries are flip flopping."
@StingRaySeems UK hasn't done a lot of testing considering the population going by your post. Thought they do more.

"And just to add to one of my earlier posts, we have extended testing criteria to anyone who deals with large numbers of the public. They don’t specify which exact professions, I imagine so they can still interpret it as they see fit in order to ration the tests. Police, supermarket workers, Centrelink employees??? Who knows."
"I do agree with all of your points Mr. C. Also, I can’t see the point of reporting total infections when, here at least, almost half have already recovered. The media loves to put a bad spin on everything and our government is lapping the public fear up. What’s happening here is every totalitarian government’s wet dream. People are surrendering civil rights without questioning, some even begging them to take more. Almost universal blind obedience to every new restriction. Citizens reporting each other to authorities..... divide and conquer. So many businesses forced to close instead of being allowed to innovate to work around distancing guidelines. Millions of unemployed. Our government keeps saying to expect at least six months of this and telling business owners to “hibernate”. Preposterous. While I don’t believe the restrictions will last that long, many do and will not be willing to hang on that long. The government is giving them no hope. At least say a month from now we will review closures. The only statistic that really matters here is community transmission and at the moment that is very low."
"""And how many with ""Almost universal blind obedience "" .... will simply say, OK, you saved us, take our money, we're so happy just to be alive.""Tax exiles, Apple, Amazon et al excluded."
"All who earn, pay taxes one way or another. Especially USA, you can't hide."
"Infections tests only show a small % of cases, true numbers could be 100x the figures, until they role out tests that show who has had it we don't really know.Even the death figures are not accurate as many countries are now only counting hospital deaths, even New York has not got enough testing to test everyone who dies outside hospitals. If you think there is not a problem then look at the hospitals and the morgues, in some cities there are converting other buildings into morgues or using refrigerated trucks. You can't compare annual figures with this virus, it has only been around a few months, look at the daily rates over the last month. Yesterday the USA had about 15x the daily suicide rate."
""" The test rate in Thailand currently stands at 1,079 cases per one million population while the infection rate is at 2.8% of people tested.The rate of infection discovery is not different from South Korea despite the fact South Korea conducted many more tests, as high as 9,099 cases per one million population while its infection rate stood at 2.19%, said Taweesin Visanuyothin, spokesman of the Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA).""https:/…ccsa-defends-testsEdited: 8:27 pm, April 08, 2020 "

"Well that thread veered off the subject quickly. Here it is late May, and TH only reports 0 or 1 or 2 new infections a day, of course near the border where the bad filthy evil foreigners invade and bring in the virus across the border lol. As if TH were basically virus-free, and there were no new cases, even severe ones, in the slums of Bangkok, full of uneducated people in cramped quarters under precarious conditions of hygiene. What gives?Anyone here actually IN Thailand to confirm what is going on; the expected new COVID cases should hit a plateau, but the reported numbers here are better than those of New Zealand, Germany etc. What's the true picture from inside the country?"
"Here in Ko Samui, the last confirmed COVID 19 case happened 42 days ago. I went to the largest hospital on the island several times in the last 2 months. Mostly empty. And the infectious disease specialist had time for a chat (she had only one COVID 19 patient then).Many people in the so called first world are not willing to make the changes necessary to battle the virus and instead question those who have succeeded. In Thailand everyone was wearing proper medical masks when the governments in Europe and North America were telling their people that it wasn’t necessary."

One can get rough idea of effect of Covid 19 by comparing the number of deaths and/or funeral in February/March/May year on year.Compare the number of deaths this March with March for the previous 5 years.
‘One can get rough idea of effect of Covid 19 by comparing the number of deaths and/or funeral in February/March/May year on year.‘ : the total number of deaths in Thailand in March - April 2020 certainly decreased vs 2019 because of much lower numbers of traffic casualties.
