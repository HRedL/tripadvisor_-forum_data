"Hi all,I'm planning a Canary Islands trip in Oct 2014 and would like to understand if there're any concerns regarding the recent Ebola virus in Africa, given the proximity.Thanks!"
777Wanderlust:Today there is no danger of the Ebola virus in any part of Spain.
I would read this blog out of the Canaries and RECONSIDER.…wordpress.com/2014/…
Would love to hear more on this. We are due to go in September with two small children and are thinking of cancelling now
"Going in October. Planes are falling out of the sky too, but it doesn't stop people flying.220, immigration is massive in Dublin/Ireland and you don't know who has what, as you sit on the Luas/A&E/GP surgeries/use public facilities etc."
Not helpful canary time.
"A load of scare mongering and why does it not surprise me that the article has been posted by somebody in the US.If it was unsafe to visit the Canary Islands there would be no tour operators flying there. Ebola is contracted from bodily fluids, I imagine very similar to the way AIDS is transmitted."
"It's ridiculous nonsense to cancel a holiday to the Canary Islands because of Ebola. If it gets to a shutdown for the Canary Islands then it'll be a general shutdown with planes grounded everywhere. I'm on Fuerteventura, less than 100km from Western Sahara, and we aren't losing any sleep. It's true that there is a Protocol in place, and it isn't just on a piece of paper. I saw with my own eyes yesterday the Guardia Civil inspecting the coastline as boats can in theory come over but there haven't been any as long as I've lived here (2 years). So, yes, they are being careful and making sure we're protected even better from ALL the diseases etc that malnourished refugees can bring with them. There are no regular links to Africa from here - our tourists come from Europe and go home to Europe - if they're contaminate then you lot need to be at least as scared staying at home as coming here! Why not let the health authorities deal with it? Why let it spoil your holidays for nothing?"
"Well put, Sheila."
"I am going to Fuerteventura in September, I am concerned, but not cancelling. If anything happens i will just stay where I am :(I really hope there will be some more people hired to check the waters around Canary Islands. islandconnections.eu/1000003/1000043/0/42565…"
"Really wish there was a ""thumbs up"" button here Sheila."
"We are booked to go to Canaries in November. This outbreak seems to be getting worse and spreading with more fatalities on a daily basis. I am very sceptical when it comes to 'official statements' via government bodies, the tendancy to dumb things down, especially when it relates to an area so heavily reliant on the tourist industry. The Islands have a long history of people travelling across in boats to work illegally so why not now to escape this dreadful outbreak of Ebola? It's so easy to criticise us for being silly or over caucus but I would rather wait and see what happens, we will not be having our holiday in the Canaries this year."
"If you listen to the news, then you will know it is contracted via bodily fluids and the reason that it has spread through these African countries is because they don't have the medical facilities or the know how to contain it as in Western countries.To cancel a holiday to the Canaries in November IMHO is just madness, but everybody to their own."
"Ok. To the best of my knowledge, Ebola is transmitted by bodily fluids and sweat. I live on Lanzarote and 2 days ago was waiting to see a doctor in the Centro de Salud in Playa Blanca. I have overactive sweat glands and was literally dripping, yet nobody moved away from me?????????? I would not sit next to anybody like me at the moment. I think it is inevitable that we will get cases of Ebola in the Canaries being so close to Morocco and the Western Sahara where almost all boats leave from to get here. Que sera sera, there is nothing any of us can do about it. Let us all be very grateful it is not airborne-if it was, South Westerly winds or a Calima would probably wipe us all out. Happy days??????????????"
AThe Canary Islands are very safe.Health is very forward.I've lived there in the past and I want to return to live there.
"read Faywray's recommended blog above. I was going in November but have changed my mind, They talk of boats washed up on shore and its occupants missing. I think I won't bother and you need to make your own mind up"
"Did you read the entire link, HeidiCambridge? Like where it says: ""Outrageous Minds"" (the title of the whole blog thing); followed by""Alternative News Lunatic Fringe Esoteric""; and the tab headings:ET UFOs Dead men's Secrets RaHow loony can you get? If you believe anything on there, you'll believe anything at all."
Many illegal immigrants here.Edited: 6 years ago 
"There are many illegal immigrants everywhere, but as posted earlier, unless you have ""close"" contact with someone carrying this disease, you are very unlikely to be affected. We are going to Lanza in October and I could be worried about an ash cloud, but as I have no control over that either I will take things as they come."
"hi re your question did you make a decision what to do?. we too are travelling out to gran canaria in october, and now i am becoming very worried whether we are doing the right thing?"
"Very worried about what, exactly?There is no Ebola case in the Canaries! What more can we say? The whole epidemic is a worry, I agree. But you aren't exposing yourself to it coming here on holiday."
I find this thread absurd. If there was any high risk of catching Ebola in the Canaries there would be Foreign Office warnings and tour operators would not be flying there.
"It isn't absurd at all. Whilst there may not be a high risk of catching Ebola in the Canaries now, it is spreading and there might be a risk in October/November when the people posting have their holidays booked. I'm not saying they should cancel, but they are right to at least think about it and ask the question, especially if they can cancel now and get most/all of their money back which they might not be able to do closer to their holiday.Also, in response to an earlier post - Ebola is far easier to catch then AIDS. The following is from the WHO""Ebola spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids."""
"So basically, you are advocating that none of us should travel anywhere, as ""there might be a risk in October/November"", or next year or next Wednesday. With worldwide travel so readily available and many airborne diseases around, the fact that Ebola is spread by the means above,means I am more likely to catch something on the bus than in the Canaries."
"Another reason it is so prolific in Africa is that they do not have the means to control it as in Western countries. I don't understand what kind of satisfaction scare mongerers get. If it was unsafe, then the FCO would be advising against travel to the Canaries.I have a number of British and Spanish friends who live in both Gran Canaria and Tenerife whom I speak to on a regular basis. Not one of them has even mentioned Ebola, so can't imagine they are living under fear or threat of it."
"The problem is, there are a lot of Africans in Tenerife, mostly selling hats/sunglasses/beads etc. what I don't know is, how long they have been there, do they commute at any time and if so, is it to any area which has the infection? Bearing in mind that it has now infected a Spanish nurse, in Spain I have to add, just how safe are we? Rather worrying. Remember that initially there was no great alarm as previous outbreaks had been rather small. There is also a growing consensus that the Black Death which killed millions across Europe was not caused by rats fleas as first thought but rather was Ebola as Bubonic plague does not spread as fast!"
"I hate to sound negative but the WHO have not issued any statements recently and you have to acknowledge that it has caught most health providers by surprise by the rate at which it is spreading. Never forget that there are commercial concerns at stake here and it stifles free expression, least of all, avoids panic in the streets. So caution is not such a bad thing. Expect the worst and hope for the best but be cautious as to who you come into contact with. To summarise, don't think that the public interests are close to the powers that be hearts, it isn't and never will be, at least not until, typically, the horse has already bolted some distant time past!"
"Ebola is spread through body fluids. Now a sneeze contains body fluids. Think about the tests on bowls of peanuts in a pub or bar - in some cases scores of different urine was found on the nuts, another body fluid. Even touching somebody's sweat can transmit it! Are handshakes a thing of the past? An infected person can carry the virus for up to twenty two days before showing any signs of having contracted the disease. The reality is, we should all be concerned. I am heading over in November and to be honest, it does concern me."
Makes u wonder why there's been no mention of the canarys in England me and my whole family are going to Tenerife in January wonder if I could get a refund because we've all went of it now
"I'm sorry, Lee, but I can't make any sense of your post. You want a refund for a holiday in Tenerife? I guess that depends on your insurance cover and your reason for wanting a refund.But this thread was started by a question about Ebola. I don't imagine you post is anything to do with that topic as there's absolutely no Ebola virus in the Canaries. I doubt that the fact that one nurse in Madrid (what, 2000km away?) has caught it from her patient is likely to risk your health."
"Actually Lee, you probably stand as much chance of catching it on a bus pretty much anywhere in the world as we live in a very internationally mobile world so, no escape really. I think we should all at least be wary that we can catch transmissible diseases quite easily if we don't at least take some precautions like making sure your hands are clean before eating especially after shopping etc. it's a frightening disease for sure but you can't let it rule your life. Recent research for example, analysed supermarket shopping trollies and found a whole host of nasty bacteria on the handles. We're all gonna get paranoid!"
"I am also worrying now after Madrid, I know a lot of Spanish go to Canaries on holiday"
"Yes, we get some Spanish here. Quite a large number go to London, too. And how many Brits go to Spain and then return home?Why do people think that this is a prime place to get Ebola???"
"The reason there are quite a lot of Spanish in the Canaries might have something to do with the fact that it is Spain.As Sheila has already said, Madrid is a long way from the Canary Islands."
Hi bethanyWouldn’t be the same place without them a bit like EastEnders without any Londoners.
"Hi, I live in Fuerteventura, and in my opinion there are as many chances of getting ebola in your country as in the Canary Islands. There are many international flights from Africa to your countries, and not from Africa to Fuerteventura, planes just fly in from Europe and the rest of the Canaries. So the diesease will come to the islands by plane, and so will do in your countries. People are not longing coming illegally to the Canaries by boat. They now try to get to Europe via Melilla, Ceuta or Italy, and it is a really long trip. Refugees take months, sometimes years to get to Melilla, for example, and the disease shows symptons in 21 days. So I would worry more about people travelling to airports than illegal immigrants getting to Europe on boats."
"Personally I can't wait to get back to the Canaries in a couple of weeks. Anyone Considering cancelling your holidays, consider giving them to me instead and I will enjoy them for you. Unless you are intending on visiting a poverty stricken country with no health care then no thanks! Sheila there is no point trying to reason with some people, if the papers told them cutting off your big toe will grant them a long happy life they would probably do it...."
I'm off to Gran Canaria in October and I'm a bit worried too as the world health map shows the Canaries as one of the places where they have live cases and are treating someone for Ebola!
This Is complete RUBISH where is your evidence?
"While I agree with some of the pro-canaries posts. I also feel you should not be so naive thinking such a virus may not hit your shores, especially seeing how close you are to the coast of Africa. If anything Canaries will be seen as a potential high risk of infection due to its location. WHO will not say so as it will affect commercial businesses (airlines). But you can bet they will be keeping an eye on the immediate surrounding areas.I came here as my son is going to lanzarote next week with his mum and wanted to see what situation was with local health org in lanzarote regarding ebola.Can someone please detail what protocols are in place?Edited: 5 years ago "
"the naive thinking is that the canary islands are closer to africa nowadays than edinburgh, london, tokio, buenos aires, ny, etc it is close in a map, that's all, by plane all the world is less than 10h far away, well, say 24h if it is not a direct flight. i am sure that there are lot more people flying from that africa area to the UK than to the canary islands, and i don't see you worried about it (in fact there were an infected person flying from ¿monrovia? to Dallas and if i am not wrong it is not a coastal town at side of Tenerife).The medias SELL news, so listen them but then think a bit for yourself.By the way, the risk of being infected with HIV or Hepatitis in your day live is much higher than being infected by ebola, and better don't talk about plane crashes and things like that."
"im not listening to the news I am actually asking about the protocols from reading your local news on http://www.islandconnections.eu.The word is used a lot but no mention fo the 'protocols'.Why are people on here using HIV as a comparison? it is nothing like ebola. or the situation of contracting it. you point out (or are trying to) contradicitons to my comment while not actually listing the protocols, which I am having a hard time finding online.It is admirable that you think you are less at risk than London, Dallas etc. While and I quote""the head of the Tropical Disease Research Institute in Tenerife revealed that stringent checks were being carried out on the weekly cargo ship between Guinea and the islands.""1 little slip up with these vessels then what?So rather than contradict those who are concerned show some compassion and consideration for the real concerns family members have over their family memebers visitng the canaries.I bet Spain thought they would not have an outbreak either, but look at them now. I agree anywhere flights are flying to out of the troublesome areas in africa are at risk. However as that statement says up there you have vessels coming to your shores daily official and illegal. So that is an increased risk in itself.Now can someone please list or point me in the direction of the canaries ebola protocols."
"Hi MichaelI doubt if there are any that you will see, but they will always be in place.Your sort of comments do not help. Maybe you could persuade them not to come and spoil their day."
"help who exactly? the busniess owners on here defending their country of sake of tourists?or contradict the BS from some of the other posters?Im looking for info. obviosuly no-one on here can provide it.rather than address the serious question I have asked you choose to pan me off with off the hand comments, that are not helping myself or anyone else on here who has the same conerns as myself.human beings are not machines they make mistakes as evident in US and Spain.who would thought in this day and age when you seek answers all you get is patronised... nice.forget replying. i will call your officials and get an answer."
00 34 928 then your number
"If you google ebola and infected countries/maps etc it comes up in many a search. I guess people can only go on what they can research but what we don't know if that information is incorrect. However, I don't think you can really claim it to be 'rubbish' as that's an opinion and the fact is it has spread and that happened somehow. More worrying than contracting the disease during normal daily activities on holiday is ending up in hospital for a different reason, we all know that spread of infections is rife in hospitals. Then there's the risk of coming into contact with a dog or a bat (experts say the disease originates and is carried in bats) who have developed immunity."
"The word starts with P and ends with A.... ands its not Puka!Paranoia!:), dont forget the zombie apocalypse coming soon - are you ready;)!"

LBKE72RubbishEdited: 5 years ago 
Caleta_Surfer:Lol!
"LBKE72Do you really expect people to believe that the authorities in the canary islands are treating someone for Ebola, because you supposedly read a publication from the World Health Organization stating this to be the case. No and that is why I referred to your erroneous comments as rubbish. It is hard enough to think about these poor people suffering the way they are, and also being aware of the threat that we all face from this awful situation, without people like you spreading this sort of rubbish. Which is why I used the word rubbish because I felt it appropriate for your comments."
"I'm also off to lanzorote in 12 days!!! 21st Oct for a week with my three children, I'm worried about how close Africa is because earlier this year I travelled to gran canaria and saw a number of African people selling wristbands ect...I understand how ebola is transmitted but can't help but be petrified of me and my kids contracting this dreadful illness..I'm trying to stay calm and level headed and have no plans to cancel because there's been no reported outbreak in the canaries but I fear that my worry and preventative measures may spoil my experience especially as we are going all inclusive and I can't monitor how food ect is being prepared also afraid of me and my family using the bathroom facilities for fear of contamination from possible carriers, very stressed atm HELP."
"LBKE72Please post a link to the WHO map that shows the Canary Islands are an affected country because I can't find it on their website. Which island has ebola, one of them, all of them?kiterunnerThe affected countries in West Africa are miles away. I've just come back from 3 weeks in Lanzarote, and am hoping to rebook for December. I can't think of any reason not to at this stage. There's as much chance as someone affected from Africa coming to the UK as there is to the Canaries."
"Please put your money where your mouth is LBKE72. GIVE US A LINK!!!I have tried hard to find any backing to your increasingly alarming claims, and I can't find anything at all bar the ones where they print any old nonsense. I prefer to stick to reasoned sites. Like the Centre for Disease Control, on its website that carries specific information for travellers to specific countries: …cdc.gov/travel/…canary-islands Notice there are no warnings at all about the Canaries? And yet their main page is full of this nasty disease: http://www.cdc.gov/I can't find information on the protocol for the Canary Islands but I wouldn't understand it anyway as I don't read Spanish well. Do you? If so, you should have more luck finding it.I'm not a lover of politicians, nor do I trust them over much. But governments can't do anything right by some people, can they? If they take too many precautions then those who are predisposed to panicking panic; if they do nothing more than the situation warrants then those panickers panic about what they aren't being told. Lose, lose situation, I'm afraid!It's a dreadful shame if people are going to lose their hard-earned and long awaited Canary Islands holiday simply because of the panicking that's going on."
"Please, kiterunner, let's not go back to the days when every African person was believed to be some sort of risk. What makes you think that those people you saw have ever visited the affected areas? Don't you think they might just have been living in GC for some while?I'm afraid you are likely to have your holiday spoilt. It sounds as though this has stirred up a real feeling of paranoia in you. That's something a travel website can't help you with. I honestly think it would be a good idea to have a word with your GP asap. You really don't want to be panicking your kids and giving them an awful complex, growing up thinking that shaking hands with any black-skinned person is dangerous."
"If you'd bothered to read my previous posts I had written:'I guess people can only go on what they can research but what we don't know if that information is incorrect'So I don't think I can be accused of making increasing alarming claims! I had also stated that spread of infections is rife in hospital - that's a fact. Ebola is carried by bats and dogs (mammals) - fact. Some are immune - fact! Sorry if that alarmed you!It seems to me some people just like to pick other peoples opinions and actual facts apart like a terrier at your ankles. Live and let live, some people are concerned, some aren't. And it wasn't me asking about protocol.Another fact - I'm going to Gran Canaria in October with my 10 year old."
"LBKE72What you said was ""I'm off to Gran Canaria in October and I'm a bit worried too as the world health map shows the Canaries as one of the places where they have live cases and are treating someone for Ebola!""So will you post the link to the map on the WHO that shows this to be true? If it does, then I'm sure people would like to see it so they can then make informed decisions. Unless, of course you're saying the information the WHO give out isn't correct?Edited: 5 years ago "
"i've not seen a single report talking about the ebola in the Canary Islands in any Spanish media, so no, there are noone infected there.There are a case in Madrid, a member of the staff that take care of the 2 Spanish doctors who were infected in Africa (i think they were in Sierra Leone), and some people is/were under quarentinne as their were in contact with the nurse, but any of them got a positive on the tests. even her husband has not been infected."
I just managed 2 weeks there and have survived with great memory's :)
"The reference to protocol. Has nothing to do with this, you made a statement.I'm off to Gran Canaria in October and I'm a bit worried too as the world health map shows the Canaries as one of the places where they have live cases and are treating someone for Ebola!Until you can back up this earlier claim that you made on the site with a link on the WHO site there is no point in you making any further contributions to the thread unless it is to apologise to the people that you have caused unnecessary upset too or annoyed."
"For me its simple. Its booked, im going, I want to enjoy it, so im only listening to the comments of the positive and more informed posters.Shame on 777wanderlust for being a troll. Shame on anyone who spoils other folks holidays with their gloomy posts.Edited: 5 years ago "
"And shame on karl mb, sally b and lee g for being the same person......I suspect....shame on you......although shame on me if im wrong..lol....but I doubt it."
Kiterunner.I am so saddened by your comments Please do not worry everything will be fine and you will have a great holiday with your family. I am coming to the islands in a few days with my partner and children we will be safer there than in London not that there is anything to be worried about at home.
"Sorry for duplication but I omitted the name on the previous post.LBKE72The reference to protocol. Has nothing to do with this, you made a statement.I'm off to Gran Canaria in October and I'm a bit worried too as the world health map shows the Canaries as one of the places where they have live cases and are treating someone for Ebola!Until you can back up this earlier claim that you made on the site with a link on the WHO site there is no point in you making any further contributions to the thread unless it is to apologise to the people that you have caused unnecessary upset too or annoyed. Also another piece of rubbish you that said is. I had also stated that spread of infections is rife in hospital - that's a fact. What have ordinary hospital infections got in common with Ebola? Answer Nothing."
"In spite of all the hype, it is still very difficult to catch Ebola. There are a lot of very negative people out there."
Are we at a higer risk if we travel to Lanzarote if contacting Ebola virus
Why would you be?
No You will be fine. Late at night in PDC there might be some other things about so be careful.
"I am due to go here for Xmas. As things stand I still intend to travel, however, unlike some who will still go regardless, I am keeping an open mind and I somewhat expect that I may choose to change my plans. If the situation changes in any way that makes me feel taking my family there will put them at any additional risk - and I mean ANY - we will bail out - the lost money will not be a factor in my decision at all. Today I have moved a little more towards the possibility of canceling especially given the latest info from the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). Today it reported a sharp increase of Ebola cases in the Guinean capital, Conakry, dashing hopes that that the disease was being stabilised there. They also reported that at least one in 20 of those killed in the latest outbreak were trained medical workers. Given that Conarkry has a busy shipping line with tenerife, I think it there is a high risk that ebola may get in that way. So at the moment I just keep checking the news especially info from the charities as I have more faith that it will have no political in balance. And before anyone says but there are risks here- I know that as I said above I will cancel if I think there is any additional risks in going."
"<<Are we at a higer risk if we travel to Lanzarote if contacting Ebola virus>>Why would you be. As I posted earlier, I've just come back after 3 weeks there, and am hoping to go back in December. I'm just waiting for leave to be agreed. The Canary Islands are no more at risk than anywhere else.I honestly think if people start cancelling trips to countries because there is just a risk that ebola might get there, then it would be better if they stayed at home and never came out of their own front doors. There is as much risk that ebola will get to your own town.Obviously its a different matter if it does actually arrive on the island in question."
"I'm planning a trip from London to the Isle of Wight in Oct 2014 and would like to understand if there're any concerns regarding the recent Ebola virus in Africa, given the marginally greater proximity of the IoW to Africa."
"In fact, next year, I'm also thinking of going to France, Italy and Greece, all of which are also closer to Africa...Maybe I'd be better off staying in bed? After all, look what happened to henny penny! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henny_Penny"

"Well spotted sheila I suffer from anxiety, im not a Rascist. I'm the black girl in the picture actually!!! So no threat of me teaching my kids to be afraid to shake black people's hands..I'm afraid of ebola not black people..I added a comment for information not to be patronised, I don't think my question is out of order at all, I'm genuinely concerned that's all the same way I'm concerned about a white person catching ebola in Britain and giving it to me..the only reason I'm uber concerned about lanzorote is the closeness to Africa nothing more nothing less.. I think an attack on somebodys emotional state/ concern is much more prejudice then me trying to protect mine and my families health.. I decided to visit lanzorote because I hear it's beautiful I don't think any less of the island because of this out break..I just want to go there and enjoy and protect my self and family the best way I know how so personally think you should stop acting as if we who are seeking info are personelly attacking the place"
"kiterunnerLanzarote is a beautiful island :-)As I posted previously, I've just come back from 3 weeks in Lanza and if I can't go back in December because Mr LS can't get leave agreed I will be very upset. The thought of catching ebola there has never entered my head, any more than the thought of catching it in my own town has. Lanzarote is a long way from the affected countries. It's as far from Guinea as Manchester is from Faro. There would possibly be a rethink if there was confirmed case on the island any time between now and when I hopefully go back, but not otherwise."
"Kiterunner, I'm not a mind-reader and all I can do is take people's words at face value. You come across to me, an ordinary non-medical person, as paranoid. That's a medical condition and I was simply stating that you may need professional help rather than the advice of fellow tourists. I'm not attacking or patronising you and I apologise if it came over that way.The problem is, I can say ""there's no more risk of coming here than going to the shop next door"" until I'm blue in the face, can't I? Will it make any difference to the way you see things?Of course we all need to monitor the situation - nobody's making light of this disease. But there's a hell of a difference between monitoring and taking care on the one hand, and totally over-reacting to imaginary situations on the other."
"Apology accepted sheila and I'm sorry of my comment came across in anyway prejudiced to anybody in anyway (not me at all), I will be visiting lanzorote soon and although we may have got our wires crossed my excitement far out weighs any concerns I have about holidaying there , and thankfully yours and everybody's comments have made me put any Worries I have into perspective and I will be doing muy upmost best to just chill enjoy and not offend worry any body with my own concerns..thanx for everybodies input :)"
I am also going at the end of October and have been full of anxiety too
It is totally understandable that any forthcoming trips to any of the Canary Islands by tourists is going to raise concern due to the proximity of the countries dealing with ebola in Africa. Tourists are well aware of the Africans selling wears on the streets that may have just arrived from that part of Africa and had unintentional contact with a person who may have contracted the virus or been incubating the disease. Having seen how virulent this virus can be even for health professionals in full protective suits to catch this virus (the Spanish nurse and the American nurse) people will watch how this spreads and avoid the places that are likely to import it including the hub airport countries such as the uk etc etc. Having been to the Canary Islands many times I have witnessed the coast guards searching for small boats full of Africans illegally trying to enter the first island they have sailed to and this is obviously a possible way the virus could be spread and enter the islands. It is logical people will feel anxious about travelling to the islands given the geographical proximity in the same way the boats full of Africans are in the med trying to get to Italy/Gibraltar. To dismiss the comments and concerns of the people who may travel to these countries on this forum is arrogance and fool hardy and likely to backfire when ebola does eventually spread.
"arrogant and fool? wow, thanks!!do you know how long does it take to an illegal person (remember, illegal = bad, legal = good, as if a person could be good or bad just for being born here or there ) arrive to the Canary Islands?do you know how long does it take to a legal person move to any place in the world?do you know how many days can be an infected person without any sympthom? do you know that tests at airports are mostly a waste of time and money?replying to these questions then you have 2 options:- the Canary Islands is as safe, or even safer, than the place where i live.- we all gonna die!!!"
"Actually, ostriches don't actually bury their heads in the sand, it's more attributed to humans. If however, you lift your head over the parapet you might just see some interesting information. It is a real concern, there's no denying:- naturalnews.com/2-Ebola-quarantine-outbreak-…"
"After 80+ posts I really don't think there is any value in keeping posting the same old things. Either you believe what your government, the WHO and others who ought to be ""in the know"" are saying, or you don't. If you believe them then you'll be as happy to travel to the Canaries as anywhere else in the world. If you don't believe them, why would you believe those of us who do, and/or those of us who know the islands intimately?Nobody here is denying the existence of the disease and its dangers; nobody is claiming that there will never be a case of it in the islands. I just know I'm currently not concerned for my own safety living here. If you come on holiday I'm sure you'll have a great time. If you don't feel happy about coming, it's simple: don't come. Just don't try to panic others with unsubstantiated rumours."
Heaven help us if we start believing some of the hyperbole and claptrap written in that link at post #83!!
"I too think that it is only natural for someone going on a holiday to look at risks of going anywhere when there is an outbreak of a deadly virus! Yes people should check the facts and there is nowhere that states there has been any outbreak In the Canary Islands apart from a report that said a boat arriving from Africa may pose a risk in Gran Canaria or sparks fears. But that's not to say there are no risks to come.I came here too to look at the risk before my up and coming holiday to lanzarote, I have family living there and have been to lanzarote hundreds of times before and am well aware of the African markets and helicopters circling with some boats of illegal immigrants but as the outbreak is in Sierra leone guinea area this does not even normally have direct links to the Canaries and a plane journey is about 14 hours so a boat especially the kind of rowing boats used to get there, would take weeks and most Poe immigrants die on the way without ebola!! so I don't fear it because of the illegal immigrants, So I will be taking my holiday in november but may chose to avoid the African market this time and not because of anyone's color of skin which is an outrageous claim, it's simply because I know it's a market that people come to sell items from Africa, I do not know what area of Africa and who may have been in contact of anyone with the virus so for that reason I will chose to avoid it on this occasion. I don't think ridiculing anyone for being concerned is helpful and in fact if we all had an attitude of not taking any precautions then the virus would spread for sure!! I also think anywhere is a risk as there are nurses who have been treating and helping and yes with massive precautions and still contracting it, with the disaster that seem to be from all over the globe who travelling to and from all countries which seems crazy to me! Surely there should be some form of quarantine period!! But as far as holidaying to Lanzarote goes have rationally weighed up the risks and will still go! But I for one being a t1 diabetic and catching the flu could see me off a lot easier than a non diabetic then I like to research and weigh up risks! My heart goes out to the people who actually live in these areas and praise to the people who put themselves in harms way to help! The UKS response is laughable asking people to tick a sheet to say if they have been in contact with anytime with it and looking for people at airports that may look unwell!! Seriously!!! Oh but that's only the major airports which apparently only consist of Heathrow and Gatwick that serve London like that's the only part of the UK!"
"<<but as the outbreak is in Sierra leone guinea area this does not even normally have direct links to the Canaries and a plane journey is about 14 hours >>Lol. Not unless the Canaries have floated off somewhere the other side of the US. More like 4 hours. There are direct shipping lines from Conakry to the Canaries. I agree though, anyone trying to go from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia on a little boat to the Canaries certainly wouldn't arrive alive if they had ebola."
I mean with stops x
"Jeez, remind me to never ask for holiday advice on Trip Advisor! Sheila, wind your neck in, in fact all of you who have the cheek to call people paranoid, stupid, etc when someone has asked a genuine question on a real crisis happening not 40 miles from the shores of Fuerteventura. Families are bound to be concerned with children travelling here as guess what? Children are not very good at expressing how ill they feel when they become ill and by the time they have become totally dehydrated, maybe it's too late."
"If there was a serious risk of Ebola in the Canaries there would be a foreign office warning. There is no more danger of catching Ebola in the Canaries than there is in the UK.Probably a travel website is not the place to be asking questions about diseases. I doubt many of the contributors on TA are experts in the field. They are just giving their opinion. So, if general opinions are not wanted, then don't ask the question."
ThePartridgeFamily62Please get you facts right before you contribute to the thread.Your other comments do not help either.
"I did have the same question to ask , and honestly having a concern I do think that the beautiful Canary Island region and it's environs are definitely going to be affected by the Ebola virus, so it is inevitable that the tourist industry will be affected. We trust that people being people aren't going to be truthful about contacts or origins,And this area has a large African community it' is a thought worth considering , however think of the struggle these people have come through to get there and some of us spend a while there relaxing. The authorities are obviously more concerned about limiting the damage to the industry as it is always going to be about money, but my decision will be not to go."
"Just back from fuerte , dont appear to have contracted ebola yet so happy days. Going back in january to try again.."

"No, it doesn't have a large ""african community"" AT ALL. Are you for real? There more Koreans living in the islands than africans, and the ones there would only be in some parts of some islands. And the ones there are almost all from Spanish Guinea, Nigeria or Angola, none which are affected by Ebola. Furhermore, whatever boats may come…which now are almost none and has been for a few years before ebola, will make it to shore this time. You know what I think? I think you exposed as ignorant racist for whom ""All africans"" must be the same and if they are black they must be ""all a risk"". You cretin."

None.
"You know may ""pateras"" (boats) there has been this year? 2 Have you been keeping up with the news? At all? Because Spain is in the grips of really bad financial crisis with 23% unemployment. DO you know that means? Immigrants stop trying to travel to places where there are no jobs, reason why the boats stopped coming some 5 years ago."
"FInally, a person making sense."
"I can't believe the number of people on here sprouting It will, won't, is likely to or nor not likely to- Fact is we don't know if it will get there or anywhere else. To be concerned due to actual FACTS- not hearsay does and not make anyone a racist (what a stupid comment). I am concerned due to actual info I have found out from trusted sources - Medicine Sans Frontières (MSF), CDC and infection control Europe MAA. sources for trial/ off licence use infoFacts -1. MSF- Conarky is now the biggest hot spot for Ebola in Guinea- The biggest shipping route from there uses Tenerife as its first stop. I don't care what colour / ethnic origin the sailors are - just who they have been in contact with before sailing and on Tenerife2.MAA/ CDC - Because of the above the main hospital in tenerife is earmarked as the main center for all ships in the region to be sent if anyone on them falls ill with suspected Ebola- even cruie ships - one RCI ship carried out a drill for this on tenerife last week3. There is an African community - However, most probably aren't traveling back and forth any more than similar communities in the UK - I would have the same concern about contact with those in UK Liberian communities as they may even be more likely to be traveling back and forth- before any one shouts racist - I have the same concerns with other UK nationals flying back and forth for oil and mining jobs in infected regions. On saying that I would not go to the African Market at the moment- and again before some shouts racist the close friends we go with are coloured and they also want to avoid this.3.There is no Ebola in tenerife that we know of yet4. We do not know if its more likely there than say LondonFor me as I said before if I feel more at risk there by the time my holiday comes than here in scotland I will not take my family. For balance I am also keeping my eye on London as I am due to go there in late Nov- If there is an out break there I will be rethinking that too. Not sure what my plan is if it get here!!"
Post 86 reported as harrassment
did you mean 96 - can not see much issue with 86  I could tell that the poster of 96 was just looking to provoke a response here - a troll - so I just tend to ignore them. A few more posts like that and hopefully they will be band.Edited: 5 years ago 
"Oops my mistake. It was 96.People are entitled to their opinions and it doesn't matter whether you agree or not, but you don't have to be rude and insulting."
Post 94 Was not appropriate either.

"I used coloured deliberately as they are not of African decent - but a different mixed race- and I didn't want to be misleading on here and portray them as such. Not all ethnic people have any issue with being called coloured - this mixed race family described themselves as such, so as they do, then I have no reason or issue with doing so also. As for what they call me - well they are as close as family to us, we have been friends since school, shared a flat as students and we have holidayed together for over 20 years since - I think they would know if I was racist !!"
"Ebola testing being carried out in Tenerife after an arrival from Sierra Leone (who had had contact with Ebola victims) reported sore throat and moderate fever.Sounds like it's being handled well as the article I read (in Spanish) indicated that the guy voluntarily isolated himself upon return (on 12 October) and did not go to work. The hospital activated its Ebola procedure and he was taken to hospital in a prepared ambulance and is now in a negative pressure isolation room. As a precaution his two housemates have been admitted too but they are not symptomatic.Samples have been sent to the Carlos III hospital in Spain for testing, hopefully it will turn out to be nothing. (travelling to Lanzarote next month but tbh think any risk is higher in central London where I am now!)Edited: 5 years ago "
"...Here is the Spanish (from El Pais)Además, hoy el Gobierno de Canarias ha activado el protocolo ante posibles casos de ébola para atender en el hospital de La Candelaria, en Tenerife, a un paciente que salió de Sierra Leona hace ocho días y que tiene fiebre, informa Txema Santana. Es un hombre que llegó a Bruselas el pasado día 8. El día 12 llegó a Tenerife. Tiene 37,7 de fiebre. Permanecen aisladas también las dos personas que conviven con él. No presentan síntomas, según han informado las autoridades sanitarias canarias en una rueda de prensa.Se trata, según ha sabido EL PAÍS, de un enfermero de Cruz Roja que ha trabajado durante un mes en el hospital que tiene esta organización en la ciudad de Kenema. Cruz Roja puso en marcha un hospital específico para tratar a enfermos de ébola a principios de agosto por el que han pasado 35 de sus delegados, explica Juan Jesús Hernández, responsable del Plan de Salud de Cruz Roja. El enfermero pasó allí 30 días. De los 35 delegados de la organización, cuatro siguen allí, nueve están en vigilancia activa supervisada y los otros 20 ya han superado los 21 días de cuarentena, ha añadido.La directora del Servicio Canario de Salud (SCS), Juana María Reyes, ha informado de que el paciente ingresado en La Candelaria (Tenerife) en virtud de la aplicación del Protocolo de Ingreso Hospitalario por ébola estuvo en una zona de ""alto riesgo"" en Sierra Leona y, por tanto, en ""contacto directo"" con el virus. Además, Reyes ha detallado que dos familiares directos serán también ingresados en el complejo hospitalario para seguir su observación por cuestiones de seguridad, aunque ha aclarado que ""no tienen clínica"".He is a Red Cross worker who was treating victims in Kenema, so he is likely to have been hyper-alert to any symptoms and acted responsibly with contact etc. Hope that assuages any fears :)"
"One person is now being tested for Ebola at the hospital in Candelaria after returning from Sierra Leone and developing a fever, 37.7 C. That was 16 October 2014. The results are due today as samples have been sent to Madrid. Clearly this is as yet unconfirmed, if it is Ebola then to identify contacts of this individual.Edited: 5 years ago "

"I too, have booked to go to Tenerife in January and I am considering cancelling. I may be overreacting but the looky looky men, as they are known, who come across from Africa illegally to sell watches, jewellery etc could possibly carry the disease to the island. As it is passed via body fluids, as some people have already said, a sneeze, or an unwashed hand from a carrier touching things, could spread it. I have looked at Simon Calders web site..he's an expert on travelling and he says its fine to go, but I am going to wait till end of November before I decide what to do as that is when I pay the remaining cost of the holiday. As it is, if I cancel I would lose the deposit. . You would not get any refund if you cancel."

"The risk is close to zero, there is no Ebola in Tenerife and the African street salesmen are almost all from Senegal where the Ebola situation is stable and they will soon be Ebola free. A very different picture from some other African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone where Ebola is far from under control. Some people have been tested in Tenerife, but all have been found to be clear. Enjoy your holiday :-)"
Senegal was declared Ebola free 10 days ago.
"With the ammount of Illegal immigrants arriving on its shores and yesterday 35 with fevr and symptoms, I would be wary but with air travel it could be in uk and not canaries first who knows.?? you pay your money and take your chances."
"StMichael, please elaborate. Whose shores are they arriving on, and which countries are they arriving from?"
"35 with fever and symptoms??? Pull the other one! The boat arrived in GC from Saharan, an Ebola-free country. One person had a temperature and 3 others were unwell (probably seasick!). None have Ebola - NONE. 3 gave their country of origin as Sierra Leone or Guinea but maybe they left there when they were kids - they didn't come straight from there.The police and other authorities took all the necessary precautions, as they should. But there is no danger to anyone in the Canary Islands. And no Ebola here."
Business as usual here.... Nothing to worry about 7th November 2014.As safe as anywhere else.
just come home from canary islands i seem ok :)
and why shouldn't you be OK?
