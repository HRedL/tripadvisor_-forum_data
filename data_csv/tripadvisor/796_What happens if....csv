Can someone explain what happens if you are in Cancun and either have a fever or your tested and have Covid? I’m sure I’m not the only one who wants to know. Thanks! I’m hoping heading there on the 26th.
You get to go to a hospital at your own expense for a few weeks.
"Just had some friends return. He got a fever towards the end of their trip. They requested the hotel call a doctor, they did a rapid covid test at the hotel, it was negative. They told him that the rapid test is not as reliable during the early stages of covid and they took him by ambulance to the hospital. They did blood work and another covid test, which was also negative. Cost him $2k USD, he was allowed to fly home the next day without any issues, but was told if the covid test was positive, he would have to stay in Cancun. That is the risk of traveling, if you get it while there, you are stuck or you are perhaps around other guests that may have symptoms, don't want to say anything for fear of being stuck in Cancun. He is now home waiting to take another covid test while his symptoms persist."
What happens if they scan you going in or returning and your have a fever?
">> ""What happens if they scan you going in or returning and your have a fever?""Arriving passengers are scanned. Passengers with elevated temperatures are taken aside for further examination to determine Covid-19. If negative, you're free to continue. If positive, you'll be spending a couple of weeks in isolation in a hospital at your expense."
"Any potential travelers to Mexico are watching this issue very carefully. I am wondering if the local authorities will be taking the approach to pass as many people as possible on the temperature screening in order to continue to rebuild the tourism trade and minimize the impact of COVID-19 in this area. It is not clear to me what the threshold for what is considered a positive test for the temperature test. Alternatively it's possible that there might be an effort to have at least some positive tests so that people are moved to an ""all inclusive"" hospital while they undergo quarantine. This will be at a significant cost that will not be covered by health insurance. It will also cause issues with rebooking of flights and costs there as well. You will also have to continue paying for your originally booked accommodation (resort, condo, etc.) . Regardless of what happens, you will be at the mercy of the local authorities. Thus, as with some many things with COVID-19, who knows how this is going to roll out? Only time will tell."
Does people know you can get ABROAD medical coverage! Blue Cross & Blue Shield offers it through some company. You pay nothing except the CO-PAY! Most people get this when they are studying abroad...
What Blue Cross is this? It covers Covid?
"It’s HTH Travel Gap Excursion PlanIt’s one million in coverage for $53 dollars, but it changes based on how long you’ll be gone and ages."
"Well, im packing tylenol. I dont think they accept insurance there"
"If you have a fever or c19 symptoms when you’re due to travel, please don’t take Tylenol to reduce your fever in order to be allowed in Cancun, cancel your trip.I bought travel insurance through Travelsafe for my upcoming trip to Mexico. It includes medical coverage for c19. It was fairly reasonable, $125 for 2 of us for a week.Edited: 8:13 pm, July 11, 2020 "
What happens.....you discover booking a holiday in the middle of a pandemic was not a smart move.
"not sure about Cancun but here in Merida, none of the private hospitals have room for COVID patients - going to a public hospital is the last place you want to be hospitalized"
No....just curious. Smart remarks aren’t needed.
"medical insurance will not cover you,,,,you will have to prove you did not have virus before the start of trip....how will you do that..?? tests are unreliable,,,,,you will be fighting the insurance company to try and get paid,,,,,,they will use every loophole to not cover you,....if you are hospitalized in mexico expect big bills...you option would be to try and get on a plane and get back home,,,,unfortunately you will be risking spreading to all the other passengers,,,,,,,,unfortunately there will be some who will take this option to avoid paying large medical bills in mexico...Edited: 2:11 am, July 12, 2020 "
“Medical insurance will not cover you”.This is a blanket statement which is not necessarily accurate. There are some companies which are offering medical coverage for c19 when traveling out of the USA. Do your due diligence when purchasing travel insurance. I had our insurance agent review the medical coverage portion of the travel insurance policy before we made the purchase.
"If you make out of the airport there are some resorts, Riu and Palladium, that have pretty decent plans in place in case of infection. Their websites explain them pretty well. Remains to be seen if they really follow thru. From Palladium: When travelling with Palladium Hotel Group, guests will now be able to benefit from free health care insurance during their stay at selected hotels and resorts in the Americas."
"“Medical insurance will not cover you”they will not pay out,,,they put that on the policy to sell it.. if you get sick you must prove you did not have virus before policy came into effect,,,,good luck with that.....expect huge medical bills if hospitalized in mexico....Edited: 12:07 pm, July 12, 2020 "
medical insurance will not cover you? Both my partner and I just got off the phone in the last few days with our insurance companies. And guess what both of us will be covered in Mexico if we get Covid! His policy will actually fly him home. I’m having to buy separate $50 policy that would cover medical flight home if I got Covid.Yes we may have to pay in advance and get reimbursed. However both of us have a credit card with incredibly high limits and a decent amount of cash in the bank. So this is not going to be a real dealbreaker
Karma.......
Yikes! Can you share which resort they were staying at? Hope your friend is well.
"medical insurance will not cover you?how will you prove you did not have covid before your trip....even if you have a test these are deemed unreliable.....you will pay all your medical bills then you can expect long fight with insurance company to try and get reimbursed,,,,,,,they will use every loophole to avoid paying......how will you get home??? will you get on a plane and risk infecting all the other passengers ??....or long stay in mexico???https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/2…Edited: 3:35 am, July 13, 2020 "
"Greg.... you might share some more info regarding the insurance carrier you are referring to so travelers will know not to purchase from this company. The travel insurance I purchased has an extensive section regarding coverage for C19, which includes coverage for C19 as a pre-existing condition if you purchased the policy more than 21 days before traveling. The insurance policy is underwritten by a reputable company. We also have some basic coverage from our health insurance for international travel, but we were like Carol and concerned about having additional coverage for circumstances such as medical evac."
"Greg probably can't share more information because he's on a mission... to create fear.Generally if you purchase Travel Insurance at about the same time as you pay for the trip then you won't even have to worry about this pre-existing clause Greg is fixated on. I am not saying someone should or should not travel, but please base your decision on facts not 'Trip Advisor Fear Mongering"""
"From Travel Guard's insurance informationFOR POLICIES PURCHASED ON OR AFTER MARCH 11On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. Therefore, any losses for trip cancellation, trip interruption and/or trip delay caused by or resulting from quarantine due to COVID-19 is not considered “Unforeseen” and will not be covered under the terms and conditions of this insurance policy.However, this does not affect any Medical Benefits available under the insurance policy. If you contract COVID-19 prior to departure, you would be covered for Trip Cancellation, if you have a confirmed and documented diagnosis and/or you are medically unable to travel at the time of departure due to COVID-19. If you contract COVID-19 while on a covered trip, you would be covered for Medical Expense and Trip Interruption/Curtailment benefits if you have a confirmed and documented diagnosis.Hmmm... looks to me like Covid is covered if I get it at home or away...."
"Thanks for the info, Carol! All travel insurance policies are different & the blanket statements being made by greg are simply untrue.Edited: 9:50 am, July 13, 2020 "
"""you can rest assured you are covered for both for medical treatment and getting back if you contract coronavirus while you are on holiday.""try to prove you contracted it on holidayThe incubation period for the novel coronavirus is between 2 and 14 days.you could add coronavius as a pre existing condition on your policy then obviously you cannot travel on plane....i dont think the other passengers would be very happy..GOOD LUCK,,,Edited: 10:43 am, July 13, 2020 "
"I am seeing some hotel chains offering free health insurance when you book that covers covid. For example the Palladium will give you a $5,000 policy."
