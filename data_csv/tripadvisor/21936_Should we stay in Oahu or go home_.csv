"We arrived in Oahu 3 days ago and are staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It has been an unbelievable vacation so far. We just found out that our home state of Indiana has its first reported case of Covid 19! We are scheduled to fly home on the 11th. Should we just stay until things have settled down? I know it may be weeks, months, or even years but maybe that would be the safest thing to do. ; )"
Pick up the phone and call friends and family ... maybe co-workers ... and ask them the same questions. Although my heart goes out to you ... it would be unwise or unfair to take a stab at an answer.
Stay in Hawaii until the whole burns out.... should be late summer.
yes - milk that stay in Hawaii for as long as you can . . . :)
Well there has just been first confirmed case of coronavirus on Oahu.. At this point it's pretty much impossible to escape the virus (unless vacationing in Antarctica appeals to you;) So you might as well stay in Hawaii and have some fun in a meantime!https:/…
"What would going home do for you? Will it mean taking care of family you are worrying about, or just going home to be there?"
We are coming from Australia for our annual visit to participate in the fabulous Hapalua. Nothing will stop us - two weeks in paradise.....
Well if there is Covid 19 on Oahu then maybe we should just go to Kauai? Actually we were on Chinaman’s Hat yesterday maybe we should have stayed!
"Robin,SW created a corona virus post and there is a lot of good info there.IMO it’s probably everywhere and we just don’t know it bc we aren’t testing every person who sneezes and blows their nose. If I was already there I would just wash my hands often and try to enjoy my vacation. But I do understand your concern if you or your party is elderly or has medical conditions.Good luck."
"I don't think this is a serous question guys. I think she is kind of trying to find an excuse to stay in Hawaii and wonder if this one works.She's just having some fun and I'm glad she is enjoying Hawaii. If I had to go home to Indiana, I would probably prefer to stay in Hawaii too. She does not need any more ""coronavirus advice"" I don't think."
"I also think this is a ""joke"". But not really a very funny one given the seriousness of this crisis.Because most people couldn't extend a Hawaiian vacation for ""years"" regardless of the reason."

What Suze said.
Placebets is right. It was in humor. Hawaii is so unbelievably beautiful and romantic. I would love to have an excuse to stay longer. Suze I am sorry if you do not think it is funny. This is a travel forum and I come here for enjoyment and information. There are other places to go for serious information. The humor is in the fact that no one could extend a vacation for years. At least no one I know. Robinson Caruso excludes.
"People visit the forums for many reasons. Restaurants, safety, bars, sports, shows, transportation, cars, condos, museums, surf lessons, shopping....All of which are allowed by TA."
"And I am sorry that you think Covid 19 is something to unnecessarily start a ""funny"" thread about.I'm sure there are other topics you can bring joy and humor to this forum with."
"Hello! We are due to arrive at the same hotel this coming Saturday. If you haven't already, no need t come home early. Enjoy your time. Our plan is to still come to Hawaii for our week, barring any canceled flights, etc. We have had our trip planned for a long time and it is a risk, but to be with my family and spend this time. I am curious to know how things are on the ground at this hotel as well as have you seen other impact around the island, such as things being closed, etc? No worries. My home state is Missouri."
The more people keep traveling the longer and faster covid will spread. That. Is an inconvenient truth. Too bad places have to lockdown like China or New Rochelle to stop people from not thinking about the larger impacts of choices.
"There is a graph I saw on tv and again on Facebook, which I believe is a good indication of what needs to happen to slow this virus down. It's going to require all of us to help with this. The article with the graph makes so much sense. I'm sure many have seen 5he graph. I'm going to try to see about posting info here, in case some have not seen it. We are all going to have to do our part."
