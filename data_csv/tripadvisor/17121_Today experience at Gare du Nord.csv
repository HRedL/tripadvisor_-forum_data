"Hi,Today we arrived at Gare du Nord from London. I had read many advices and tips on here. But we were still experiencing scam. We got into the official taxi stand waiting for the big taxi for our family of 5. The first taxi came. We specifically asked for metered taxi. The guy said ok the put out luggage in the trunk. We got in the car and tell him we need to go to 20 Rue de Cujas. He then said it's a set fee of 75 euro. I said no, meter please. He said no so we refused and got out. We came back to the taxi stand and told the official guy that that guy wants to charge 75 euro and want a metered taxi. He put us on another taxi and said metered. We got in and the taxi started when the taxi driver said 55 euro. I told him no and asked for meter. He said that because we take a van taxi as a family, it'sa set fee. I knew this is not the case but decided to just take it. After all, kids are tired.This experience really gives Paris a bad impression. I had a feeling that the official guy at the taxi stand is in with the taxi drivers. I want to warn family that will take taxi that this did happen to us and be vigilant.Christina"
That's disgraceful. It sounds like it is a scam epidemic probably because so many others have already gotten away with it.
"Yeah, about time the authorities got on top of this, but until people start reporting the scammers through the correct channels, I fear it will continue."
"At least when you decide to be bilked take a photo of the license plate etc and report them to the police. This is disgraceful. While I would not have stayed in that cab, I can understand why you did. But the guy should be reported.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Yes, it’s really discouraging that this continues to happen. I too wish people would report this through the channels. Maybe if it’s reported enough, the authorities will do something."
I am furious for you ! This was pulled on me too and I’ve been visiting Paris for decades ! It’s bullsh8t and needs to be dealt with and I don’t want no nanny pamby apologist trying to gloss this over ! I only wish you hadn’t paid the second time ! When this happened to me my friend I was with was so embarrassed that I demanded the driver return us to station ! But I held firm . These criminals only get away with it because tourists can be tired and stressed - grifting creeps
So sorry this has happened to you. I hope it doesn't spoil your trip to Paris. Can you just confirm where you got in the taxis at Gare du Nord?Enjoy the rest of your stay with Navigo Decouverte in hand!
We got into the official taxi stand.We got off the train. Followed the sign for taxi by turning right outside. You can't really miss it. It's an official taxi stand with designated lanes set up.Edited: 1 year ago 
"""Can you just confirm where you got in the taxis at Gare du Nord?""There is no reason to further confirm what was already plainly stated and described. OP says they had read the warnings, they went to the official taxi stand and even spoke to the attendant.There is no other place at Gare du Nord with a line of taxis and an attendant other than the official taxi stand. There may be lots of illegal drivers who approach you in the station who are not taxis, but there is not a ""fake"" taxi stand outside that looks like the real thing with an attendant and line of taxis.So no need to suggest or question that OP might have been somewhere other than the official stand. Besides, this same thing has been reported on this forum time and time again over the last few years, so there is nothing particularly unusual about it at this point."
"Some people ""think"" they are at the official taxi rank when they exit the front of the station. Some scams involve a guy with a hi-vis vest on ""pretending"" to be a dispatcher, so it's worth checking and confirming that this wasn't the case.Thank you OP for responding - enjoy your trip and thanks for the warning."
"Inside every taxi on the left passenger window, there is the registration number of the taxi in large print.I have bitten my tongue on lots of occasions when experts here have reassured posters that taxis are completely honest in Paris. Since I take so few taxis, I am not at all on expert on them; but I would have liked to be able to believe what the ""experts"" were posting. My own impression over the years is that immigrant taxi drivers are generally honest (because they have more to lose in case of a problem) and that a lot of the French taxi drivers are crooks when they know they are driving naive suckers around. But I won't say that, because it would not be politically correct.Anyway, I took a taxi the other day for the first time in about four years, because I had to go to Orly at 5 a.m. The taxi driver seemed okay, but he seemed to be hesitating with his meter setting. So I said ""the fare is 35 euros, isn't it?"" which he confirmed, and then the meter displayed that amount immediately.I will continue to use public transportation whenever possible, and good luck to the rest of you."
OP perpetuated the problem bu not getting out of the taxi.
"Hi kerouac2,Hmmm...I didn't see any big number on the passenger side window. The only thing I saw is some kind of sticker on the windshield on the passenger side. It was small so I couldn't see clearly the number. I'll Google it to find a picture.Thks for your tip..."
"The number is on the sticker and it is the biggest thing to see there, because everything else is in fine print."
"OP, sorry it happened to you and thanks for the heads up.I hope you have a great visit in Paris with the family.Paris is a very special place.Not for nuthin, but also thanks for responding to the earlier negative (and really ignorant) comment someone posted. with 3 tired kids, just off a train and wanting to get to my hotel...I would have taken the same course of action you did!"
"We got scammed also from Gare du Nord after being in the official taxi line - they are all in on the scam. Everyone is a tourist that is in that taxi line. We waited in line and the guy that was organizing the line asked for 5-6 people for the mini van and we had 4 - he said ok if I don’t get 5 or 6 people he will take you. My husband asked how much the fare was to St. Germain and he said “you have to ask the driver” so he put our bags in and got in and then the driver said 75 euros and I said no way let us out or put on your meter but he said no it’s a flat rate, a van, to the left bank, etc etc. We were in the middle of traffic by this point so couldn’t get out and I told him you are ripping us off. He also said cash only. My husband told him he only had pounds since we just came from London and hadn’t stopped at the ATM and that he would give him 60 pounds. My husband just wanted to get to the hotel at this point. So frustrating that I read all of the posts on TA about gypsy taxis and the official taxi line so I thought we were doing everything right and still got scammed! We are experienced travelers also, not our first time to Europe. We were with our kids and luggage too so just hopping out in the middle of traffic wasn’t an option!"
"Until people start taking photographic evidence (the taxi license and tag number) and report it, this disgraceful behavior is going to continue unabated.It’s awful and I’m sorry, Christie."
"I really dislike being ripped off by taxi drivers, but it is so common all around the world. At Gare du Nord, would it be best to walk a couple of hundred metres perhaps, and hail a driver using Uber or G7?"
"Hi Christie F,I totally understand what you went through. It sounds exactly like what happened to us 4 weeks ago. You are right! They are all in on this...the guy at the official stand and the taxi drivers. Because of this experience, I avoided taking taxi in Paris like a plague. We took the metro and bus the whole time we were there. It's easy and stress-free.Hope you still had a fabulous vacay there!"
After reading 1 too many reports of dishonest taxi drivers in Paris we have avoided taking taxis in Paris as much as possible. We did take a taxi from Gare Lyon to Mont Marte in December. It was 25E.
"Would it work to act a little star-struck and ask, on setting out, for a photo with ""my very first Paris taxi""? With the driver, at the back, with the number plate in view? Perhaps, more realistically, passengers could ask, before getting in, if the trip will be metered? What kind of basic French could visitors use?Only have your luggage loaded when the answer is ""oui"". If passengers have difficulty, just open the door - even a little. It will be a bold driver that continues with a door waving, even a little, in the breeze.Cheating is cheating in any language!"
"I'm very sorry about this bad experience. If there was no registration number on the passenger window (you really cannot miss it), then it's probably a sign that the taxi is actually not licensed. In that case you can take a picture of the license plate and report the incident using this form : https:/…20form.pdf (do not fill ""registration number"" if you didn't see one but state in the description that there wasn't one and add license plate number). If you have no information about the taxi it's more difficult but I would still report it. Maybe if there are enough complaints going up the official way the authorities will think about taking measures (one can hope)."
"I've never actually taken a taxi in Paris, but do they have to have a sticker? I tried googling and mostly they say to check for the illuminated sign and the meter (which is in the rear view mirror, I guess - not sure if that's always true). The only sticker I see mentioned says it's on the rear window (3rd link).https:/…1b7a05441fcfhttps:/…fake-taxishttps:/…As an aside, how do you say ""meter"" in French? Google translate says ""compteur de taxi.""Edited: 1 year ago "

"@Op: I commend you for having enough courage to deal with this adversity to the reasonable extent while considering for your children at the same time and thank you for sharing your taxi plight. I hope this horrid incident did not blight your trip experience. I used the Taxi from the CDG airport once, when I traveled with my family. While the driver was loading our luggage, I was in front taking photos of the license plate and the parking permit on the right front bumper. Inside the cab, I immediately checked the passenger side windshield for the driver’s permit number. The absence of driver’s permit on the windshield and the absence of parking permit on the front bumper is an alarm for none official taxi."
We have taken taxis many times in Paris and always to the airport without any issues at all. This seems to be a Gare du Nord phenomenon and I am a bit surprised the city hasn't done something about it.The taxi drivers are shooting themselves in the foot because people who read this are likely to go with Uber.Edited: 1 year ago 
"It was tried, in a fashion, on me from CDG a couple of years ago. We arrived on a Sunday, and on the way, the driver tried to tell me there was a weekend surcharge of €10. His English was quite good, and I told him I’d never heard of that and was he very, very sure???He very pleasantly backed down and all was well. But it’s definitely a thing. And it’s too bad because as you say, Janet, the taxi drivers are doing themselves a disservice."
I can imagine how many people this has happened to considering only a few would know to come to Trip Advisor and report their warning. Somebody should just stand there and take some videos right at the dispatcher and taxi drivers.
"Totally agree with you Janet.These taxi drivers are hurting their livelihood. I avoided taking the taxi the whole time I was there.My children refuse to come back to Paris for vacation but I will still come back as I do love the food and the architecture. I will plan my next trip accordingly so that I won't have to take any taxi at all. On this trip, we used the Navigo Decouverte passes and they are awesome!"
"Hi Soph5035,Thank you for the form and tip about license plate. I couldn't get his taxi # or his license # but filled out the form and reported the incident anyway.I hope something will be done about it!"
"I have only taken cabs upon arrival and departure from CDG with no incident, and it is too bad that one experience (I assume) left such a negative impression on your kids; maybe as they get older, they will realize that things do happen while traveling, and if they eliminate every place where things go wrong, well they will be limited.. that said, you did have quite a trial, how terrible both cab drivers were crooked. And people wonder why lyft and uber are so popular!"
"** This seems to be a Gare du Nord phenomenon and I am a bit surprised the city hasn't done something about it. **I am sure a noticeable consumer complaints will catch the official's attentions. However, most consumers for variety of reasons might not file a grievance. For instance, they might be from another country and not knowing the flat rate does not apply at Gare du Nord. They might be well informed (like the OP in this case) knowing the journey is metered but not sure where to file a grievance, not a TA user or maybe they just don't have the time or the patience to deal with the matter."
"This can't be a mystery to those who control the cab system. They don't need perfect complaints to act. when we were in Hong Kong every one was handed an information sheet which spelled out the costs to Hong Kong from the airport, that the tolls were included, that there were no tolls on the return trip etc etc. This allowed me to play hardball with a cheating cabbie on the way back to the airport. Send inspectors and undercover agents etc etc. To allow this to be the introduction to Paris so many visitors receive is not good for Paris."
"Your narrative about the Hong Kong solution seems very pragmatic and effective. In fact, several years ago, the Airport authorities in Tehran deployed similar solution to stem the rise of fare corruption, the program was a stellar and alas, they abandoned it after some period. The crux with the inspector is the temptation to form a triangular alliance with the dispatcher and the driver to receive kickbacks. These resources mainly recruited from lower socio economics and in major metropolitan most likely their emolument is not commensurate with the cost of living. Of course, NOT everyone is corrupt, however, it seems the existence of disingenuous elements in this industry is pandemic and not limited to Gare du Nord, Paris, Bangkok, NYC and so on.Edited: 1 year ago "
