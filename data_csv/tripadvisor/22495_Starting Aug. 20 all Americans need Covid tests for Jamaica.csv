New reg announced late yesterday.
Good! Though in my opinion a 10 day window is is too much time from test to travel but it's better than nothing. The world needs a fairly reliable rapid test at the airport as well as pretesting. One would think that could be possible in this day and age. It a shame we dony have one in place.
Can you please forward you web link to the new requirements please it’s not noted on visit jamaica.com. If I need to do something different it would be good to know now!
"Beginning August 20, 2020, all persons visiting Jamaica aged 12 and over who are residents of the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Dominican Republic or Mexico, will be required to obtain a COVID-19 RT-PCR test within 10 days prior to their intended date of travel. The test result must be uploaded as part of the Travel Authorization application process.Until the above mentioned measures takes effect on August 20, the similar requirement for residents of Arizona, Florida, New York and Texas in the USA, will continue to apply. The test should be performed at a medical laboratory that is accredited by the relevant national health authorities. For the United States of America, the medical laboratory should be accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP)."
I would love to see the website info so that I can ensure I’m not missing anything can you send a link please?
It pops up on visitjamaica.com. Is there a chance its being blocked by a pop up blocker?
"<< “ A rapid test at the departure airport entrance, still outdoors, for all travel would be awesome.” >>If you do the math on that you’ll see how impractical that is. While the processing of a single test may be rapid (around 15 min for a negative test) each machine can only process one test at a time. So processing 200 passengers for just one flight would take 3,000 minutes with one machine. Yup. Even with a “rapid test” machine at every gate it would take FIFTY HOURS to screen and board just one flight. Two machines per flight would bring that down to 25 hrs. Four machines... 12.5hrs. Eight machines... just over six hours. 16 machines PER FLIGHT would still take more than three hours to board a single flight. Thirty-two machines would get that down to around 1.5 hours.That’s 32 machines PER FLIGHT.An airport like BWI typically has about 700 flights per day. Newark about 1,200 flights a day. Atlanta is over 2,000.So, at peak travel times you’d need about 6,000 test machines — and 6,000 trained personnel — at Atlanta airport.The problem is not how long the test takes... it’s trying to do hundreds of thousands of them a day in a single location.Edited: 8:22 am, August 15, 2020 "
Awesome!! Excellent move by the govt! This might keep some people from traveling but those who are will be negative at the time and will still be monitored here on the island.
RJP-NJ. I understand it's really not practical. Wishful thinking...
"Irestar, the JA govt should have required the test since the day the borders opened. Americans would have complied and still come to the island."
"Cebakes: I totally agree.,, but I think it should be any visitor, from any country, should be tested. Covid is worldwide. Our first cluster of cases came in from the UK."
"I understand that they are requiring the RT-PCR test, however that can take at least 7-10 days for the results to come back (I work in a hospital, and I called this morning to verify)... that being said, since the test is only valid 10 days prior to arrival, and we have to complete the travel authorization and upload the proof of negative status, will they accept a rapid test instead of the PCR?... not really sure how travelers are expected to produce both in the allocated time if the labs are behind"
"You need a PCR test plain and simple I’m sure you understand working in a hospital those rapid tests prove nothing. So get your PCR 10 days out (which is a very generous time, Aruba requires 3 days) and plan on spending your vacation at the resort.Keep Jamaica safe"
"point being if a test is only valid for 10 days prior to arrival and it could take longer to get the results, maybe allow more time or another type of test such as the SOFIA... there are multiple types of tests, and to be quite honest the validity of ALL tests have come under scrutiny, not just the rapid tests"
"@letsgo I agree! give everyone a rapid test. who cares about how long people have to wait to get out the airport. The safety of all is more important. If anyone has an issue with it stay home and go to miami. So happy they are testing everyone. I wish they did not ban attractions though. Even the best all inclusive gets boring after a while. They should at least let people travel along the corridor, make the tracker mandatory and fine people who refuse to social distance/wear mask properly or face deportation."
There are rapid test that have been developed and are going through the approval process. This is one of them:Israeli-Designed Instant Coronavirus Breathalyzer Could Be Rolled out Globally ( https:/… )
"You are all lucky to even be traveling to Jamaica as most Jamaicans can’t come to USA at the moment.So go by the rules or stay home, doesn’t matter what you think the govt should do, after you go home you won’t be thinking of the citizens of Jamaica."
"first of all, we have family there so you might want to mind your business... you have no idea who we are or what our business is there...I asked a question and you Karen came in all hot and holier than thou, so for your uneducated information, YES we will be continuing to be thinking of the people in Jamaica once we leave, the same as we have been prior to arrival, THANK YOU"
"yes, good luck!!"
CnJ-TX that test would be incredibly helpful! Those type of tests cant come soon enough. Would you even need people to administer them? Pick one up at the door and show your result.
We're supposed to be there on the 22nd as well! We called all over and was able to get appts tomorrow evening and they said it should take 3 days. I hope we get it in time! They said it's a PCR test but not RT-PCR. Does it have to be RT-PCR or is just PCR sufficient?
Those are the same test
I haven’t seen anything mandating the reverse transcription vs traditional PCR test. The important part seems to be that the lab where the test is run is CAP accredited. I’m also in Maryland so will message you w some info.
"#24 This was taken right off the visitjamaica website: it’s always been an RT-PCR test using a CAP certified lab. @@@@@@@@@@ IMPORTANTAll residents of the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Dominican Republic or Mexico who are 12 years of age or over, with travel dates of August 20, 2020 or later will be required to obtain a COVID-19 RT-PCR test. The test should be conducted within 10 days of the intended travel date at a medical laboratory that is accredited by the relevant national health authorities. For the United States of America, the medical laboratory should be accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP)."
Can anyone confirm if the molecular RNA tests at AFC clinics in mass are acceptable ?
"Dear Sunseeker,It's the right kind of test but you need to find out which lab your AFC clinic uses. Jamaica requires that the lab be accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP)."
"Thank you! They send it to Labcorp which is CAP accredited so we're OK. At the bottom of the visitJamaica website it gives you a link to check if the lab is accredited and it says:""Need a test?Find a CAP accredited lab near youAccredited Laboratory and Biorepository Directory(request a PCR test)"""
Quest Labs are CAP certified as well.
Everything is described in the visit Jamaica web site: https:/…
Has anyone completed a travel authorization form within the last day or two? How long is it taking to get an approval?
It can take 36 hours.. says so on the site I believe.
It was instant on Saturday
"We uploaded our tests on Saturday (the 15th) and nothing yet. They are giving a 2 day time frame, but I'm not sure if that's two calendar days or two business days."
"just FYI, may be helpful to someone... if you're a Healthcare worker and getting the pcr test, let them know as they may fast track the results for you if you're one of the travelers who are getting the information last minute and traveling close to the 20th, or in an area where testing is taking longer, as the pcr test is one of the ones that seem to take a bit more time"
"My arrival is 9/3. We are currently booked 4 nights at Hideaway and 3 nights at Tensing. Will they not allow us to switch resorts even though both are within the Resilient Corridor? In addition, what about walking the beach???"
"kristiemlove,Current protocols say that you have to remain on one resort property and not move to another property. Please go to the Visit Jamaica website to see the protocols."
"""My arrival is 9/3. We are currently booked 4 nights at Hideaway and 3 nights at Tensing. Will they not allow us to switch resorts even though both are within the Resilient Corridor? In addition, what about walking the beach???""You will not be allowed to stay at two resorts/hotels. They will make you pick one - better you do that in advance than waiting to see if you can do that at the airport as that will just take that much more time (they will make you prove you have changed your arrangements before they let you leave the airport).Walking the beach is a no-no under the current stay-at-resort/hotel rule. Stay on your hotel property means just that - ON your hotel property."
Tourists are now allowed to move along the resilient corridor again. Pushback caused jamaican government to reverse decision. Still need a covid test before you arrive
@bkkDid that happen today? We arrived yesterday and we told to stay on our resort. I'll look it up but that's great. Does that mean we can leave for excursions? Thanks
"Cannot see any reversal on the Visit Jamaica website. It still states :-Stay in Resilient CorridorThis measure applies only for tourist visitors who are staying in the “resilient corridor” designated for tourism purposes. Under this measure, persons are required to remain at their hotel/resort within the corridor for the duration of their stay.Angie."
@kaina jamaicaobserver.com/front-page/…It seems as it has not officially been reversed but It is expected and an announcement to be made really soon in regards to the reversal. Hopefully before you depart. This newspaper article was published 3 hours ago per their website
"We are scheduled for Jamaica on 09/05. We have our negative pcr tests from an accredited lab. We are from Arkansas in the United States. I am trying to find out if we will be required to test again at the airport if we do not have symptoms and if we will have to quarantine, we are staying at moon palace in the resilient corridor. If we have to test, and wait at the resort for results, can we leave our room?"
"No, they will not test you, make sure you upload that test as soon as possible ( 5 days before) there have been some delays on getting the verification letter."
"Our tests are from Baptist Hospital and results come thru ""mychart"" but they say Covid19 test negative. I have verified the lab and type of test but it doesn't actually say that on the results sheet. Will this be a problem?"
we are going to jamaica in a few days. can you tell me how things went from when you landed?
"Updated protocol regarding Covid tests from Visit Jamaica...Pixel tests are not accepted.IMPORTANT: COVID-19 PCR test required for some countriesAll residents of the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Dominican Republic or Mexico who are 12 years of age or over, are required to obtain a COVID-19 PCR test to submit a Travel Authorization application. Uploaded results using home test kits (ex. Pixel by LabCorp), along with antibody and antigen tests are NOT accepted. The sample should be collected no more than 10 days before the intended travel date, at a medical laboratory that is accredited by the relevant national health authorities. For the United States of America, the medical laboratory should be accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP)."
"highly recommend paying for club money, 3 planes landed same time as us and while we had a wait it was minor... had to answer a few health questions and show our authorization a couple times and that was it (aside from the usual)...oh and temp check and sanitizer of courseEdited: 12:28 pm, yesterday "
This is a good thing but should be for anyone from outside of Jamaica as well.
"""This is a good thing but should be for anyone from outside of Jamaica as well.""Why? Many countries have this thing well under control. The countries listed, including the US don't - and the US being the worst of all.Statistics alone say that someone traveling from the US has a far, far greater chance of having the virus than say someone from Norway. Yes, someone from Norway CAN come in with the virus but the chances of that are far less than someone coming in from the US, Mexico, Brazil etc. It's a numbers thing and our numbers s*ck.Edited: 2:15 pm, today "
