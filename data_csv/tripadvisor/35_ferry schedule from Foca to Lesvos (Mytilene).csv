"Hello! I'm hoping this is the right forum for posting this question. I'd like to find the ferry schedule from Foca to Lesvos (Mytilene) on or around August 13, 2010. Is there a schedule available online, and also, is it possible to purchase tickets online as well?"
"Hi,I have written down can take a look at the link.  http://www.feribot.net/feribot/"
"Thank you! This may be a naive question, but I couldn't see Foca as a stop in the departures section of your link... is it under a different name?"
"Hi,I'm sorry I forgot to mention earlier.Tours to the island of Lesbos from Foca will begin in June.You can not get information from the first round in June.When making a call in June you can also get help from turyol.com .I apologize for the mistake again."
"Thank you! I've waited and now that it's June, how should I find the ticket information online? I tried the website you posted but couldn't get results for August 12-14, though I'd heard that there is a ferry that runs during that time... thanks again!"
"""www.turyolonline.com""from this site, you can find the information you want.Here are the phone numbers of agencies you can contact. If you have any question please don't hesitate to ask me."
"Thank you! This very helpful. So, if I'm understanding the Turkish correctly (google translate), there is a ferry from Foca to Lesvos on Fridays at 18:00 (6pm) in August?If so, I tried to input ""August 13, 2010"" from Foca to Mytilene, one way, in order to purchase tickets and it says ""We do not have voyage with entered criterions!"" ... is it just too early to purchase the August tickets online, or should I just chalk it up to a poorly run site and try to contact the foca tourism office or a travel agency to purchase tickets instead?"
