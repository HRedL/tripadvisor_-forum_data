"Hello, we’ve of course canceled our planned trip to Alsace this summer, but I’m still interested in monitoring the situation in the region. Can anyone suggest a reliable website that provides daily case #s for the Haut-Rhin department? I can only find data for all of France. Thank you, I hope all reading this and your friends and family are staying healthy and sane."

Can I have an update regarding hotels and safety in Alsace
Most hotels are open with safety precautions in place. In most cases information appears on a hotels website page or they will provide it (in French) in response to an email request.Expect to have to wear a mask in public areas.
Any new updates for August 2020? Are the cases lower now in Alsace?
