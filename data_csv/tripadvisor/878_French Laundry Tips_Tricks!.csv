Any suggestions on better times to get into French Laundry? Tips or tricks or recommendations? We’ve tried for years for every trip we’ve taken and we’ve never had luck. We have the Amex which used to provide preferred reservations but my understanding is Amex has ended its relationship with Thomas Keller within the past year. I’m sure most tips and tricks are kept secret for a reason so I may not get a response! I’m just so bummed we can’t get in despite trying everything.
"Go to their web site and try various dates that work for you.If nothing shows, up put your self on the wait list.https://www.thomaskeller.com/tflMake your reservation far in advance.This is a difficult year as many restaurants in California are closed.Tricks that worked in the past won't work this year.So make your reservation on line or call the restaurant directly."
I have heard (no personal experience as this is way above my pay grade) that some hotel concierge has connections and can get you in. It's also easier at lunch than dinner.Don't know what the situation is during COVID.
Somehow French Laundry and Covid-19 aren't a fit for fine dining. How anyone could enjoy fine dining during a pandemic is mind boggling.
"To each their own. I try to be more positive about the situation, even when others (like yourself) insist on focusing on the negative. More glass half full than half empty. I am fortunate to still have a job and good health, so I try to pay it forward and support local restaurants when they need it most. If any restaurant is equipped to ensure a memorable experience, even during a pandemic, it's French Laundry."
Thank you to everyone for the suggestions and recommendations!
"Follow their instagram (@_tfl_) for announcements of when blocks of reservations will be released. For example, reservations for the month of September will be released on August 15th at 10:00am (PST). Be sure to pre-register an account with Tock, if you don't already have one so you're ready to go. Dinner reservations for parties of two are the first to go. As mini noted, join the waitlist for any/all dates that would work for you. Kellie M. Napa Valley Bike Tours"
"The FL is seating guests outdoors, and anyone passing by can observe that they are, without a doubt, enjoying fine dining and having a great time."
How could #4 be removed? It was a sensible post. Please repost.
"As has been suggested, twice we went through the Concierge at Villagio, and Meadowood.Once, we did use AMEX Platinum Concierge.Have not been post-C, so no comments on how things might work now?Best of luck,Hunt"
"Its a more difficult scene for dining than in the past here in California. With so many restaurants shuttered and locals trying to escape Shelter in Place, some of the tricks of the past won't work. Reservations/Wait List is the norm for 2020. Also be flexible with when you want to dine. Just responding what I've found out this year for Loop Garou."
"Mini,Thank you for the update.We had a Central Coast, Paso and Sonoma trip scheduled, for mid-Autumn, but cancelled.Have not had any meetings in CA, since early Mar, and the prognosis does not look good, at least for us.By the time we get back, much will likely have changed, yet again.Hunt"
"Maybe ""sensible"" is subjective."
"Thanks to everyone who provided helpful advice. I appreciate it!Edited: 9:15 pm, August 12, 2020 "
"Also I’m sure everything is much different in the Napa area post Covid. I know here in Vegas it’s been extremely tough on our economy, particularly for the small local businesses. We considered canceling our trip but choose to go, spend our money, and just be safe about things. Still plan to enjoy our time and do what we can to support the Napa area since it has a special place in our hearts. We have other restaurants in mind (Bistro Jeanty, Bottega, Farmhouse at Long Meadow, Celadon, Rutherford Inn) so while we will be disappointed if we miss French Laundry, we know there are more fantastic options to enjoy."
"OP,Hope that all works out for you!Most of all, enjoy in these odd times.Travel safely, and stay healthy!Hunt"
"Just found reservations available on Tock for 8/21 at 7pm by selecting ""find next available"" after my original choice was not. Mind you prepaid @$350pp. I have noticed alot of high end dining including Alinea now taking reservations on Tock, as are wineries."
"One of the tips (pre-covid) that I give is to be open to having lunch there. If you are on the waitlist, it opens your options. Since I'm still furloughed I haven't tried it post-covid. :/"
