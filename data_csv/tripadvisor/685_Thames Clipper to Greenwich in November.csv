"Assuming all this Covid nonsense is over by then, we're planning on visiting London in November. Would like to take the Thames Clipper to Greenwich in the morning. IF I'm reading the schedule correctly, the earliest time from the London Eye Pier appears to be 0833. Wondering how long it takes to get to Greenwich via the Clipper, and also when the Royal Observatory opens (having trouble on their site as they are still doing the social distancing thing right now)? Also, is there a nice place in Greenwich for afternoon tea?"
"The Thames Clipper timetable is here:https://www.thamesclippers.com/assets/doc/TC…You can see the departure times from the London Eye and the arrival times at Greenwich. Subtract one from the other and that's how long it takes.Plenty of nice places to eat in Greenwhich, but it's a bit difficult to know what will be open in November. Best to check back closer to the time."
"Yeah, a Global pandemic where many thousands if not millions, have already died is ""nonsense""...."
"I don't think there is an opening date for the Royal Observatory so that's is probably why there is no further details as yet.Also bear in mind the timetable for the Thames Clipper is a temporary one and is subject to change. TBH you probably will not be able to finalize your plans until nearer the time. That is assuming the 2 week quarantine has been lifted by then.If I remember correctly the Pavilion Café in Greenwich park done Cream Teas,"
You could keep an eye on the Fan Museum and its cream teas.https://www.thefanmuseum.org.uk/orangery
"Don't set off so early. The Clipper service carries commuters from central London stations to Canary Wharf in the morning rush hour. Though commuter volumes are tiny at the moment, by November I'd expect more people (though not pre covid levels) to be traveling to the Wharf, and you'll be fighting for space with commuters. Set off after 0930 and you'll not be fighting for space.In any case, None of the sites in Greenwich will be open before 1000"
I doubt if the Covid 'nonsense' will be over by November. If anything just gearing up for a second wave. Planning any international travel (esp from the US) for the rest of this year is reckless in the extreme.
I don't think that any of families who have lost loved ones would be happy about describing covid-19 as nonsense.
