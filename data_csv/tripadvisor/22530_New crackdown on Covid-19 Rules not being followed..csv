Wise. IMO should have happened before the K. Bayram holiday though!
"Good, but the horse has been followed by all the farm animals out of the bar (yes) door. :/"
I agree CosyCarol. They should have been out in full force over the Bayram holiday. I hope that they start making more inspections in all touristic areas including Antalya

"Better late than never but I also agree with cosycarol's opinion. I assume we shall see the high jump on the new case (regardless on how many tests done) around the second - third week of August. Following twitter ""coronavirus turkey agency"" with its video clips showing no mask, no social distancing, crowded on beaches and city centers, those have scared me :( Anyway we shall see what will happen."
"I wonder how the trace and trace would work with all the people who descended on the Fethiye area last week and put tents up on beaches, car parks and pieces of land. Then left, leaving all their rubbish behind them including human waste. The photos of the rubbish on one beach was unbelievable.. I felt sorry for the council workers having to clean it up."
Me tooFJ. It sounds as bad as Bournemouth etc... then they will be the first to wonder why the cases of this horrible virus are increasing.
"Me too FJ. Actually I think campsites should be closed down or limited in the amount of tents that can be put up with social distancing in place. I would imagine that these camp site owners could care less and only about making money during bayram. It is supposed to be in a more controlled manner. Everyone has ID taken, Temperatures checked and telephone numbers are recorded."
What's been happening??
As in many other places. People have forgotten common sense in favour of running about as before the pandemic!! Masks worn only by those that are responsible. People not observing the social distancing rules. All gone willy nilly! Bars opening..... You can guess the rest!!

Sorry to say not many wearing masks tonight on the prom in Calis beach.
Has anyone been told what the hotel procedure is if a guest or member of staff is confirmed as having Covid?
"They locked down a hotel in Tenerife after two guests tested positive for it, so would think it would be the same."
