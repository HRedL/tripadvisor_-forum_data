Effective July 22 closing. UK & others still open. Be safe.
I hope this is resolved for my hopeful travel plans in June of next year as I will not be traveling if I have to take a test first.
"The TCI government is basically doing a “soft opening”. They’re aware that many tourists will for now not be able to meet the guidelines/regulations to enter TCI. Added to that is the fact that Beaches will not be opening on the 22nd with no announcement of when just yet.This will allow a return of tourists, but at a slow and steady pace. Hopefully, they’ll be able to control a major spread of the virus. Only time will tell...The Bahamas has a 10 day testing window (way too long and way too risky). So, 3 wks after opening, they have to put on restrictions for US travellers."
"Maca if the problem was the 10 day testing window they would have shortened it for all. They closed the door to the US and other countries that are out of control and finding some visitors are not obeying the rules. They left the test period in place and left open the door to countries that are following safe guidelines and reducing their numbers. I heard they had/or are having a NASCAR race in one of the southern states with 50k spectators, yeeha.Edited: 6:02 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Oh, I totally agree."
"I spoke to my friend living in Bahamas. She told me the biggest spike came from Bahamians returning that we not required to show negative test. Visitors are requiredIt sounds like the premier of TCI learned from that, she now requires all to have the negative test to return, even if the islander went off island for just one day"

"Okay, you got me ! I don't like race cars that can't turn right, but to each their own. The spike is because of those returning from where? Bahamasair has stopped all flights to the US but not anywhere else."

"People from the Bahamas ( and TCI actually) go to the states on a regular basis to shop. Hang out at MIA Bahamasair check-in counter and let me know what you think. Canada is a bit of a hike to go shopping. The doors have closed to the US in the Bahamas and will start to close elsewhere in the Caribbean soon. They will miss the tourist dollars but it is the only way to keep their people safe from those that won't do what's best for themselves and those around them, under the guise they have a right to do what they want and nobody can tell them what to do."
"Trust me Lisa, a lot of the local traffic heading to Canada is guys that have met girls on vacation(CM) that are looking to pursue a relationship( it generally doesn't turn out well). The main sport on island is wife/husband swapping! I'll take yours if you take mine.Edited: 9:23 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Maca , if you agree with me again you will be on my Xmas card list! This year it's my new red speedo collectors editions. Shot at Malcolm's beach."
Guess I won’t agree with you again. Not a fan of speedos!
"Lisa M - the only proof you need is USA 60,000+ daily new cases if Covid daily - a pandemic that is out of controlHere in the U.K. we are such a great country we have this under control, An air bridge would be the next stop for the U.K.!"
"Reading all the feedback from the Premier, they have no interest in banning US visitors- they believe the Covid test 5 days out will remove the riskGame on as they say..."
"""Miss the strike zone."" Yep."

"Like Dr. Jim said, it is their country, not yours. They (specific country) set the rules. If you have cured cancer or diabetes or are a billionaire with political persuasion, one cannot change things.Just deal with where you can travel and try to enjoy life."
#2 - you’ll be missed.
"And I will miss vacationing in the Caribbean. I just know that the tests are not infallible and I would not want to have a false positive and not be on my own turf. I went to Maine and NH in place of my trip to Grace Bay. I absolutely loved Bar Harbor, Maine!"
"The US is certainly blowing it when it comes to any semblance of leadership regarding the pandemic but it’s worth noting their death rate is lower than France, Italy, Sweden, Spain, and especially UK. Anyway, I’m thankful to be in Canada right now. Despite our own PM being somewhat of a putz, we’ve handled it fairly well."
Then USA has a lower death rate that who? Keep taking those tables they are certainly doing something
"True. Out of 200+ cpu tries, the USA is better than 6 or 7."
I believe that everyone now arriving on a commercial flight into the Bahamas must quarantine for 14 days. Might be something that could happen also with TCI depending on Covid spread in a few weeks/months.
Oh we talking about Rugby....
I was using this:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/The deaths per million.
Now for the actual reality - new daily cases?
Tick tock
"Until there is a worldwide standard of practice accepted by the entire planet where every single country is testing and providing/reporting data on the exact same criteria of test subjects, then the comparison of new daily cases has as much worth as a $3 bill."
"Ryan, I hear you. Glad that I live in Canada also. The province I live in has been Covid free for 3 days now..Feels great, but know it won’t stay that way.I believe we’re the only province in Canada to be able make that statement!Edited: 12:35 am, July 28, 2020 "
What province do you live in
"Matt , what your saying is you wish your system was as transparent as the U.K. and yes I agree we are very fortunate in this great countryStill let’s hope things start the plateau in the US"
"Deepwater, maca lives in Nova Scotia, same province as myself. We have had no new cases in almost 2 weeks now and no active cases, so yes we are Covid free at the moment."
"#38That doesn't mean you are ""Covid free"" - it just means no one with Covid was tested in the past two weeks. In my village on LI, we had no new cases for 3 weeks, now, post 4th of July, we have 4 new cases."
I believe the real issue the 4.5 Million US residents who have tested positive with Covid-19Canada is around 115k with the U.K. at 300kIt’s going to be a long hot summer....
"#39, that's because you were lax over the 4th , got out and partied. We're careful . No active cases, no new cases = no Covid."
"#39I, me, personally, was NOT lax over the 4th of July and yes, quite possibly, those who did party without properly socially distancing, are the new cases. However, again, you cannot claim Covid-free as you do not have any proof that the virus is completely gone from your region. Since you Canadians and Brits seem to think you're so transparent, I wonder if you have a town by town positive Covid-19 map like I do?https:/…3545ec3d3a3e4ac1babe7d4714fedb56"
"Sure it very well might come back in the near future, I fully expect it to, but I also expect for us to be able to identify and isolate those cases. Right now, no new, no active cases = C-19 free."
"Again, just because there were no new positives in an area for 2 weeks does NOT mean an area is Covid-free. It means no one who was tested during those 2 weeks got a positive result. There could be 100 asymptomatic individuals who are contagious running around. But if you believe your area is totally Covid-free then I guess you don't need masks anymore, right?"
"No positive tests is Covid free - that’s a fact - so to be clear if an area had no cases in 14 days it would simply be Zero positive cases, test results none, etc etc - that would be free as is nadaNobody is saying it won’t come back, the point being the poor old USA isn’t being lead it’s just floundering but fingers crossed it sorts itself out and we can all get back to normality Stay safe"
"Yes here in the U.K. we can look at area by area, number of tests number if positive folk - it’s an official web site that hasn’t had to bow to politicsEdited: 12:09 pm, July 28, 2020 "

"Canada may have flattened the curve, but it is not on the downside of the curve like NY and is still showing new cases. You're not ""better"" than the U.S.A. and you are not a Covid-free country! Btw, I cycled the entire southern shore of Nova Scotia as a teenager, lovely countryside. Saw the Northern Lights. Had a big fight within the group because some of us wanted to go up to see the Bay of Fundy and others didn't. Lost that battle. https://www.covid-19canada.com/"
"You need to look at the ""Rate of new cases by previous date"" graph. Not the total cases graph otherwise you are comparing apples to oranges. If the USA is doing so great why most places not let us in to their Country? And why are more than 142K Americans dead?Edited: 1:10 pm, July 28, 2020 "
"#49Seriously, the U.S.A. has approximately 331,000,000 people and Canada has 37,000,000. In other words, there are almost 10x as many people in the U.S.A.as in Canada. We also have many more densely populated cities than Canada and if you look at Quebec City, for example, they're not doing all that great. The UK, at 64M, still pales in population to the U.S. And I know you folks think your socialist healthcare is the cat's meow, but the UK and Canada are among the highest Fatality Rates from Covid-19 in the world, far worse than the U.S.https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/This is from 7/28 and I just plugged in U.S., UK and Canada:https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=USA~CAN~GBR"
"#50 Apples and Oranges again. Look at percentage positive rates.. Below 5% and you have a chance of doing a good job. Math , by your own admission is not your strong suit. Be nice if the USA could get their act together. Richest country on earth and we don't have enough PPE or Reagents after 4 months of this. Need me to say USA and 45 is Great? Fine. Best President Ever? Sure. Man of the Year, Noble (sic) Peace Prize, face on Mt Rushmore. Seriously being a fellow NYer/LIer you should know his history."
"#51Well gosh, the snowflakes in this thread deleted my post so we can't refer back to the FACTS - fewer people per 100,000 DIED in the U.S. than in Canada and the UK. That's a FACT. I'm not talking about positive cases, I'm talking about DEATH. DIED. DIDN'T RECOVER. That shouldn't be political."
"#52per 100,000US - 46Canada - 23.6UK - 67.6So Canada so far has done much better in this metric, UK worse. However the US is still right in the middle of this with huge number of infections in recent weeks. So many more deaths will follow."

"#43 swnovaCongrats on being covid free. Shows if taken seriously, positive results can happen. When we had 15 cases we were told it would be down to zero very soon and it would have been except for all those tests.No testing = no covid 19"
"#49 happyYour numbers are way off, the US went over 150,000 today. Hope this news does not make me unpopular."
"#53From the site I have been using which lists 215 countries and compares countries using per 1 million only 8 of the 215 countries have higher death numbers per million than the US. Being ""in the middle"" would be an improvement.The US does much better in cases per million per country. 9 other countries are higher and that includes French Guiana which has 25,275 per million & US has only 13,584. Glad I don't live in French Guiana."
"by no means would i suggest TCI, bahamas or any other island completely open their borders to anyone without restrictions, but they might want to consider varying the restrictions for visitors from the US based on the infection rate of the state of residency (like USVI does as well as travel in the US between states). Just a thought, and I would imagine a lot of folks travel to the caribbean from non-hot-spot states like NY, NJ and CT."
#56 Noted thanks. I'm retired ergo don't have to think any more but still livin' in the past. #57 If we work on it like we have been there's no way USA won't be number one again....Latest CDC projections I saw were over 175K dead by August 15. So much winning....
