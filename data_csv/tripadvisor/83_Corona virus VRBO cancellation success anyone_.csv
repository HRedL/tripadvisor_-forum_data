Have a rental vacation coming up one month from now over 70. Any advice for getting money bacj
"First, read your contract. When does the ""no-refund"" clause kick in. You may still be in time to simply cancel. Note that each owner sets their cancellation terms, so check there first.If you are inside the cancellation period, then ask the owner if you can either get some sort of a refund or apply your money to another set of dates. Keep in mind that owners are generally kind and will do what they can -- but they also have mortgages and expenses and they would rather not go out of business.FYI, I'm an owner, and have fully refunded money from people who have asked -- the most recent for a guest scheduled to arrive in less than a week.Good luck. If worse comes to worse, I would simply not travel if you have to fly. If you are driving to the destination and it's a relatively low-population density spot, weigh the risk of having a nice holiday versus staying home. My vacation home has about 6 people at a time in it. My grocery store has hundreds who touch surfaces in between cleanings. Which is safer?"
"Well I for one am never booking with VRBO again. We booked a 6 person Blue Bay Villa in Curacao (10089768, owner ""Mark"") We have to cancel because even if we could get there, the Canadian government has mandated that we would have to self isolate for 14 days after getting home-we cannot do that. Mark's response to this worldwide crisis? ""The reason is not of interest""- he isn't prepared to refund our money, and it sounds like VRBO won't step up to the plate to deal with this. Please people, give VRBO and owner Mark at Blue Bay , property 10089768, in Curacao a wide pass"
"We booked a condo in Lahaina, Maui, for March 2020, and had to cancel due to the Coronavirus. We received half of our money back per the contract with the owner. After repeatedly asking the owner for a full refund, which she refused, we asked VRBO to refund the remainder. Even after we told VRBO that AirBnB is giving full refunds to their customers, VRBO said they would not give any refunds due to their company policy. We look forward to doing business in the future with AirBnB and will not book with VRBO or HomeAway again. Awful experience!"
"To you two first-time posters, please keep two things in mind:1. Many owners will simply go out of business because of the extreme loss of revenue. At my home, I let everyone off the hook and I have NO BOOKINGS AT ALL for the future. This is similar to small restaurants that will have no customers for months but still have bills to pay. So, while you are posting personal information of people with whom you SIGNED A CONTRACT telling the world to beware, keep in mind they did not cause this problem. They are victims as well.2. You chose not to purchase travel insurance. Period. Yeah, I know, no one saw this coming -- which is exactly what insurance is for.Welcome to the forum. Try to see both sides of the story."
"Oh, and Tony... ""Even after we told VRBO that AirBnB is giving full refunds to their customers, VRBO said they would not give any refunds due to their company policy.""Yeah. When I saw that Air was going to terminate my refund policy and tell me what I had to do -- and relieve you the customer of needing to insure your trip, I blocked my calendar on Air. You can rent from me on VRBO, but not AirBnB. My home, my rules. When Air pays my bills, they can call the tune. And before you get all hot with me, keep in mind that I gave back 100% of every payment to anyone who asked. It will cost me thousands.Edited: 9:18 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I also own a house listed on VRBO and couldn't disagree more. These are challenging times for all of us, but I would never consider not fully refunding a renters request due to this pandemic. We have an upcoming trip scheduled to Kauai with our two children, and the owner has refused to refund a penny not even the cleaning fee if we don't come. So, we either potentially put the family in danger on our flight, or just eat a substantial payment. We will be posting a 1-star review, and hope others do the same in this situation as I will never stay in a property where somebody refused a full refund. It sounds like you are doing the right thing, but I am very surprised at the amount of people who are not. Karma's a bitch."
"Tom,I'm not sure who or what you are disagreeing with. If it's me, fine. But the facts remain that owners are at risk of losing their businesses if they cannot pay their mortgages. These are small operators who may also be out of work if they are not lucky enough to have a job where they can continue to earn a living. So, they take a double hit. Should they lose their businesses because you rolled the dice and did not buy insurance?So... maybe they look like hard a$$es to you, and maybe you think it is unfair. You don't have to book again with them, but really, you're being pretty silly to suggest that the owner is putting you at risk if they force you to get on a plane and risk infection. Most people would be pretty darned happy if that was the only thing they've lost or will lose in this crisis. Leaving a 1-star review? Really, from a fellow owner? And a guy who says karma's a bitch? Come now. Over on a closed forum for owners, we talk about this -- if you don't give a refund, the guest will fry you -- but not for a bad home -- for enforcing a document you signed. That's pretty low.Could you post the listing number of your home so we know all owner that should be avoided? ;)"
"This isn't my business, but the only way I can afford to own this home that we've had for 10 years. Like you, I have 0 rentals in the future. I love my home in Tahoe, but I believe in doing what's right. If I have to sell my home due to this, I will do so. I'm not worried about taking care of property owners but the people who are spending their hard-earned money. Remember this post started from a 70 year old lady who will be totally screwed. breaks my heart. My county has just put everyone under self-imposed quarantine, i.e. we can't leave our home for anything other than essentials.I won't share with you my vrbo listing, though i'm sure you can find it if you want to. 5/5 with 76 reviews.I believe you are doing the right thing with your approach, maybe we just agree to disagree as to what should be required from homeowners.."
"and sorry, if you're not giving full refunds you're not welcome in my house."
"I am the orginal poster. All of us who will be renting are over 70. I did purchase travel insurance with Generali which is the company that VRBO refers renters to. The insurance website states that that since i purchased my policy after January (I purchased the policy at the same time I booked) and Covid19 was known about then it cannot be a reason for cancellation unless I test positive for the virus. (BTW testing has not been offered in my rural area yet) . Simply being worried about traveling or in a high risk category does not count. If anyone has been successful with VRBO property listers or this insurance company, please let me know. Thank you ."
"Also the trip involves flying to Florida with a stop over in Atlanta. i think i can recover most of our airfare but the rental is appx 6000. Thanks for all of your replies and if there is another section of the board where I may get some advice, please direct me."
"Sally, your situation makes me incredibly sad. And your insurance experience is maddening. If you and your group would like to re-route your vacation to Tahoe even at a further date, I will offer my home to you free of charge. Now or later, as long as we can figure out a non-booked time. Please contact me directly."
"Wow. Thank you Tom, I am still going to try to work with Vrbo on this. So much was planned. Also, this is such an uncertain time and us ""oldies"" with underlining conditions have been advised not to fly. I can't imagine that will change soon.Your offer demonstrates that there are truly generous people in the world."
"Please stay in touch, happy to honor even if far down the road. Much love!"
"Okay Tom -- you get a lot of points with me now. I do think there needs to be balance between who absorbs losses. Owners on the edge should not lose their homes. But your offer to Sally was pretty darned nice.Sally, you have not said if you have tried to negotiate something with the homeowner. Lots of owners are offering some middle ground -- like a partial credit toward another set of dates. I would try that.As far as the insurance -- when you purchased your policy, there was not a national emergency in the US. So, knowing about COVID-19 then (and only in China) seems like a rather weak excuse for not providing coverage for a US cancellation. Perhaps contact your state's insurance commissioner, and if necessary tell the insurance company and VRBO that you will be sharing your experience with the media. No one wants a sweet little old lady on the TV talking about being cheated by their company. Don't give up on them!Good luck."
"We initially asked our Kauai owner for the opportunity to reschedule at a later date, not refund our money and that was met with a flat ""no"". Honestly, even an offer a partial refund or credit (partial or full) towards a future stay would be at least something. As Tom)mentioned, we also own a vacation rental through VRBO and at least showing some flexibility goes a long way instead of getting a ""you need to do what is best for your family"". There are many reasons that we ""choose"" to not travel at this point. It is irresponsible to do so and as of midnight last night we are on a shelter in place in our area. LoonMountainMan, we do disagree on some things but I thank you for doing the right thing for your guests and not having them make a difficult decision whether or not to travel to avoid losing their $$. No one should be traveling right now. Hope you all stay safe and healthy and that we all come out well on the other side of this crazy time!"
VRBO is a ripoff. They will not refund my $4500 for a FL condo cancelled due to corona virus. I will never use them again.
"Chaz, help us out here... don't just rant. The condo did not ""cancel"". I'll bet the owner is happy to have you. The problem is that you probably can't get there and should not travel. This is not the owner's fault.When were you supposed to arrive and what is the cancellation term? Tell us a bit about your circumstances and we might be able to give you some guidance."
"I've said it before, now I'm saying it again. Each VRBO property owner is different. I have a luxury home on VRBO which is located in Rome, right around the corner from the Spanish Steps.My normal cancellation clause is full refund if cancelled more than 60 days before the arrival date, and then it falls to 50% refund if less than 30 days before arrival.I have had 6 cancellations due tis COVID-19 -- and I gave a 100% refund to each even when they were arriving in less than 60 days (one person had actually arrived and had another 3 weeks left on the rental). This is NOT within the terms of the contract, I didn't have to do it, but is my decision to do the right thing, given the very serious and fluid situation we now find ourselves in.So, before you say you'll never book with another property listed on VRBO again -- I am here to tell you, there are some good people that own homes on VRBO. And, we are going to need your patronage in the future!"
"Spanish Steps, I commend you for doing the right thing!! Good for you and I wish you all the best!"
"Thank you very for the kinds words, FunJunky. It's hard, but in my opinion, the right thing to do.I am actually thinking of how I can help friends in the hospitality industry. Thinking of buying gift certificates for tours, wine tastings, etc. and then giving them as presents to those that book later this year. It would help out people in the hospitality business NOW, when the need the money, and be an incentive to those that come back to Rome as soon as this horrid thing is over.We are all in this together!Edited: 6:34 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"We have been doing the same here in the Bay Area with the local restaurants and businesses that have had to close due to our shelter in place...ordering takeout or delivery from restaurants as well as purchasing gift cards from our local small businesses all help! Sadly, we have friends and neighbors that already have had to close their businesses that will likely not recover from this..."
Has anyone had success with insurance claims for booking prior to January? I didn't get insurance as I had in the past and found it impossible to collect. Now the owner is saying tough luck. I won't be using VRBO again and it sounds like there is a lot of us.
"Like many complaining about this company this week, I attempted to cancel my upcoming vacation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the call by the U.S. to practice social distancing and self quarantine. Vrbo has an opportunity to follow the lead of competitor Airbnb and grant travelers who are having to cancel due to the coronavirus outbreak a full refund. Instead, Vrbo chose to take a more passive approach and leave the granting of refunds to their property owners (many of whom are letting greed drive their decision). These owners have provided a service or product for which travelers are asking them to take a loss. On the other hand, Vrbo had an opportunity to make the thousands of customers/travelers who use their service whole by not forcing a loss (not covered by travel insurance) onto us. We are not asking for a refund for a product or service that has been consumed but one not yet used (Property:7103678 Sarah). Shame on Vrbo and I hope my fellow travelers and consumers hold you to account for your actions during this time of uncertainty. I will never use this service again."
"@MsMD post #24 - although I understand your anger, I am deeply disappointed that you have felt the need to publicly identify an individual property and the owner's name, on an open public forum. This affects all of us. There will be guests who pay for holidays they will not take; equally there will be home owners who will not be able to pay their mortgages and costs and will lose their homes. The image of greedy multiple property owners living in expensive condos is far from the reality of many VRBO owners. The right thing to do now is to go back to your post, click on ""Report Inappropriate content"" and select ""Remove my post"". By all means post again and air your feelings and thoughts freely, but don't single out an individual property and owner who has decided, for whatever reason, that they want to hold on to the money they have been paid.Edited: 5:26 am, March 20, 2020 "
"@ slpvanB post #2 - what I just posted above ^^^ applies to you too. Every word.Edited: 5:35 am, March 20, 2020 "
"I reserved a home 6 days before check in thinking we could drive 6 hours from our home. I explained to the owner I was worried about the coronavirus. During that 6 days a national emergency was declared. All grocery stores were wiped out, restaurants were closed and gas stations were out of gas. I contacted the owner. She said VRBO would not allow it. I told her it was up to the owner. She stopped all contact with me. I lost the full amount and VRBO/Homeaway would not even allow me to leave a review describing what happened since we did not stay at the property. DO NOT BOOK WITH PROPERTY ID 957784 in Lake Hamilton, AR. She is a heartless, greedy person.Address is 120 CATALINA CIRCLE #8F HOT SPRINGS AR 71913."
"So you name and shame someone here... could we have your name and address as well, please?"

"Wirewiper, I fully agree with you.Anyone naming and shaming someone here should do that by providing their own full name too - so that they can be avoided as potential guests."
That 70 year old lady might be much better off than the owner. The lady won't lose her house - she will lose a couple of thousand bucks max. Will it destroy her life? No. You would rather lose your house than compensate people AGAINST what is in the contract? I think that's stupid but of course it's up to you.
"I've been battling terminal cancer for 12 years. I'm finally in a remission and thought it would be nice to take my family to Hawaii. We saved for a year, only to have Covid-19 ruin next month's plans. We reserved three condos through Vrbo and so far only 1 of 3 will offer a full refund. If the opportunity ever presents itself again, we won't be using Vrbo."
"As an owner on Vrbo, and a traveler with the site for over 20 years, might I suggest another scenario? Would it be possible to request a change of dates? This honors the fact that many owners are suffering from cancellations, but also honors that travelers can't be expected to travel with an unpredictable pandemic in place. (I , for one, don't want anyone to bring Covid-19 to my area.) It is difficult for all of us. If we remember we are all in this together and seek to be kind in working with each other, we will weather this trial and still be standing on the other side."
"Good luck, I have one next week and owner has refused to make any king of refund or rebooking. They actually suggested we ignore the national advisors on social distancing and non-necessary travel. VRBO has encouraged owners to work with their renters and claim most have but that is obviously not what I have experienced. Perhaps there will be enough of us to support a class action suite."
WE did offer to rebook at a later date and our owner said no recommending we ignor the national guidance on travel and social distancing.
"Pegge,Before you call a lawyer, realize that you cannot file a class action because the defendants are individual owners. VRBO is a broker, and you do not have a contract with them.And, please read this thread if you have not already... at least the first post. It may help explain where you are and where you can go.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…LMM"
"so, would it be reasonable to expect the rental unit to be tested for Covid-19 prior to check in?"
">>> so, would it be reasonable to expect the rental unit to be tested for Covid-19 prior to check in? <<<If you can supply details of how I, as an individual property owner in the UK, can arrange to get my property COVID-19 tested at no cost to myself, I'm all ears. Otherwise if you don't trust my property to be property cleaned and COVID-19 free, you instigate a cancellation."
"I have not read anything anywhere about locations able to be tested - just people. And there has been a shortage of people test kits, too.So right now I would say no, it would not be reasonable to expect the rental unit be tested, because there is no way of doing that."
"After much discussion and the continued advice against travel, our owner has agreed to work with us on a new date. I stayed respectival and cival throught the discussion process whic I recommend to others."
"That sounds incredibly reasonable the owner. Glad that is turning out ok,"
"Pegge, that's great news, and confirms my position that homeowners do not want to profit from other's misfortune. Some of us, actually most of us are humans too! ;)After your stay, please be sure to write a great review and mention how nice the owner was to accommodate a change! Review mean a LOT to owners!LMM"
To All Owners.....I Call B.S. on ANY OWNER holding back any refunds for any reason due to the Corona Outbreak.... This is the Moral thing to do. We are all losing our jobs due to shut downs and everyone is taking a Big Hit Financially. Not just the Owners.Also think of it as if a person purchased something from Amazon or E-bay. Now hypothetically the Government shut down the shipping channels. So now i cant receive my items that i already paid for. Does this give the Owner the right to keep my Money because they cannot ship my items? **NO** it Doesn't! It is Not Safe to travel. Per the C.D.C.and W.H.O. The Beaches and Restaurants are shut down or shutting down. What do the Owners expect us to do? Stay Locked in their Condo and or go to Drive Thru Dining? While fearing Contracting Corona? Doesn't sound like much of a Vacation.

"Ken, I guess I can't call you a first-time poster since you posted that screed three times, can I.What do we owners want you to do? Buy the travel insurance. There's a start.News flash. We are from the same planet. We are losing our jobs. We have no income on rental properties that barely cover expenses. Yeah, so we have two mortgages and lost one source of income already.I usually am sympathetic to guests, but you are a bit over the top, so...Your analogy to an Amazon product is flawed. The shipper can put the product back on the shelf and sell it again another day. Our product has a very short shelf life. I have a $400/night condo that I lose $400 on tonight. See the difference? You could have purchased travel insurance. It's for the unforeseen. Stop making a shared problem entirely someone else's problem. And before you come back with insults, please know that I have refunded all my guests in full, no questions asked. (I guess you should have rented from me, huh.)Edited: 2:14 pm, March 25, 2020 "
WOW!!!!! Talk about INSULTS!!!!Sorry for the repeated posts..... Our internet service is being affected(probably due to congestion)when i hit send....nothing was happening? Then it posted 3 times.. i tried to edit/delete 2 of them and it wouldn't let me.Anyway..........did you read the story where the lady had insurance thru VRBO and they are saying that Corona or fear of doesn't apply and is not covered....So she did do the right thing and Got Screwed!!!!! Twice....And as far as your analogy of Amazon vs VRBO Owners. You're contradicting yourself...... You say they can put the item back on the shelf and sell it later. They lost the sale just the same as the VRBO Owners. You say you refunded your Renters...(That's Great) and so should EVERY OWNER PERIOD!We are paying for a Service that we can not use.People will remember who stepped up to the plate during this Pandemic. Owners and VRBO are going to lose Allot more in the Future if they are Greedy and unsympathetic to their renters.
"While I don't necessarily agree with the analogy of the Amazon shipping Post.All Owners need to step up and do the right (Moral) thing. But human nature doesn't always allow that to happen.Most people only look at their own personal circumstances to try to justify their actions. They don't look at the big picture. The following is copied from VRBO's web site.************TO ALL OWNERS*************In a March 14th letter, Vrbo president Jeff Hurst recommended that travelers reach out to homeowners to request a penalty-free cancellation.Addressing homeowners in a letter on March 12th, Hurst suggested that they remain open to such requests. ""In the spirit of good hospitality,"" he wrote, ""we strongly encourage you to offer a full refund."""
"Morais,What you did not see, or did not copy and paste was that VRBO is planning on punishing owner who do not cancel valid contracts and offer refunds. How about them apples? We owners have a valid contract, and VRBO wants us to break the contract and give refunds. Here's why:Most guests do not understand that it is the owner who has the contract with the guest, so when things go sideways, guests get mad at VRBO. You don't have to believe me -- read this forum -- it is chock-full of guests who will ""never use VRBO again"". So, by them getting us to change our contracts is a great benefit to their reputation. And, of course, it costs them nearly nothing. (They do give back their service fee, which is only fair.) And think what you want of an owner who enforces their contract, but it's a heck of a thing forVRBO to throw them off the site for following the letter of their agreement with a guest.It is also notable that the $2 Trillion bailout money will not come to little operators like us. The big players will get the largess of the trump administration... not us."
"Oh, Ken. You arrive on the scene and ""Call B.S.""... and then you want kid glove treatment? No. You do not get it.Let me explain the fallacy of your Amazon comparison. Yes, the seller loses the sale, but still has the product. So, all he loses is the profit on the item... temporarily. He does not have to buy more raw materials and have his factory make another one to sell it to the next customer. Room/nights -- those things that we have until the sun comes up the next morning are totally lost. If my home is empty tonight, I'll never get to sell the night of March 25th again. Surely you can understand that. So the comparison is bad.Further, when goods are shipped, it is the responsibility of the shipper to deliver the product to the customer. When anyone anywhere books a vacation home or hotel, it is the sole responsibility of the guest to get themselves to the property. The owner has no responsibility in this. And, while you may not like it, the law is on the side of the owner. The owner is not responsible for the beach closing, or the restaurants closing or you getting sick. Not responsible for you having fun. In all cases that I'm familiar with, the owners have been able to uphold their side of the contract. Homes have been clean and ready to occupy. They even have that most coveted commodity -- toilet paper.So, go call B. S. and get all up in arms. But please do not be surprised when we owners, who will lose WAY more than you over them coming year, are unsympathetic to someone who cannot see that this is painful for all of us and only wants one party to bear the burden of this pandemic. I'm going to PM you my property ID on VRBO so you know not to book with me. I'll recover without you."
"Hey LoonMountainMan,You don't know my situation, or anybody's for that matter. Or how much I stand to lose from all of this!I don't need to get into detail on how long we have saved up for this trip.. it isn't a weekend Party or something we do multiple times a year as you implied!You don't have to worry about me ever trying to book with you! So under your analogy, it is the sole responsibility of the guest to get themselves to the property.Yet if everything is shut down and everybody is told to stay indoors.You still feel its the Guests responsibility? We should not listen to our Governors of Each State that are affected the most and getting worse every day. Governors who are telling everyone to stay home and don't travel if not necessary? We don't understand you logic?Some of the Owners state that they only give refunds if Guests are forced out due to a Hurricane. How is this situation any different? Most logical thinking people would see that this World Wide Pandemic is Far Worse...."
">>> You don't know my situation, or anybody's for that matter. Or how much I stand to lose from all of this! <<<You don't know LoonMountainMan's situation, nor mine for that matter. Or how much either of us stand to lose from all of this.>>> I don't need to get into detail on how long we have saved up for this trip <<<And we don't need to get into detail of how we acquired and finance our properties. Neither does any other owner.>>> it isn't a weekend Party or something we do multiple times a year as you implied! <<<Good to hear - although I don't see where that was implied.>>> You don't have to worry about me ever trying to book with you! <<<I'm sure LoonMountianMan is OK with that. You can add me to the list too, even though we are both doing precisely what you want us to do and refunding in full if asked (some guests have chosen to rebook instead as they still want to stay with me once all this is over, although I have made it clear that they are under no obligation to do this). I'm not speaking to the rest of your post because it is just the same broken-record ranting as per your previous posts. You clearly have no wish to hear the other side of the story, nor to engage and debate the points that have been put to you, more than once.Edited: 6:01 am, March 26, 2020 "
"Ken,I am sorry that you cannot take your vacation. You are not the only one experiencing pain. However, you are the one who is having trouble seeing both sides of the situation, so, as I said earlier:""...please do not be surprised when we owners, who will lose WAY more than you over them coming year, are unsympathetic to someone who cannot see that this is painful for all of us and only wants one party to bear the burden of this pandemic."" Get it? We're all suffering. Put the binky back in your mouth and stop posting."
FYI Generali which VRBO travel insurance does not cover COVID
"Alsane. There are all sorts of insurance and they have varying levels of coverage and different costs. There are policies that allow cancellation for any reason. But no company will insure your loss if you purchased a policy after the start of COVID and cancel because of COVID. (Get it??? Like trying to buy a life insurance policy when you're on your deathbed... hard to do.)So, thanks for that first-ever post. Let's try to keep it accurate in case anyone relies on this forum for information."
"As a 16-year owner and property manager listing on almost all the leading sites (HomeAway/VRBO group, TripAdvisor Group, AirBnB, Booking.com and many more) I can tell you the tide turned quickly. At first the thinking was that owners should simply ""understand"" and refund all travelers. However, after consideration, even AirBnB back-pedaled somewhat and reached out to compensate owners and also made clear that their ""extenuating circumstances"" policy does not apply to reservations made after a certain date. But make no mistake, they received a LOT of blowback and many owners blocked or removed their properties on their site due to this rash policy against owners and managers disregarding cancelation policies and not working with them.The past couple weeks (starting late March) the tide turned. Originally TripAdvisor and AirBnB were granting 100% refunds across the board while Booking.com and HomeAway/VRBO were more fair to both parties. They realized that unlike travelers who had to miss out on a planned vacation which they already budgeted for, small businesses including vacation rental owners could go out of business if they had to suddenly refund tens of thousands of dollars all at once for something not their fault. While both travelers and owners were victims of something not of their doing, the owners & small businesses were the bigger victims. This is something that was finally understood and things calmed down.Considering even airlines were offering re-bookings without penalty (but few refunds) and same with hotels -- and even most travel insurance companies weren't covering this for the most part (despite being their entire purpose), the vacation rental owner should be the last to take the brunt of it. We urge all our travelers to purchase travel insurance if they feel they may have to cut their stay short or cancel outside the refund period and are unwilling to lose their deposit. Travelers who don't buy insurance are saying in a sense, ""We will take our chances and forfeit the deposit if something unexpected happens"". You can't turn around and then expect compensation after the fact. That's like going to a casino and saying you're willing to gamble as long as if you lose you can get your money back.We compromised by allowing our guests in March & April to either keep their reservation, cancel according to the terms of the site they booked and how far in advance they were canceling, or get credit for a non-refundable stay before May 2021. For those with May or later reservations, we are only offering that same credit if one week before their scheduled arrival the bans and quarantines are still in effect. Otherwise they are held to the cancellation policy. This still hurts us because our peak season here in Arizona is Jan-Apr, when we make all our profit and which carries us thru the rest of the year when we either break even or operate at a loss. But we feel it was the most fair compromise, a balance between protecting our business and being compassionate too.Edited: 12:46 am, April 15, 2020 "
"SWL, in addition to your post, it is notable that airlines and hotel companies will have easy access to the idiot president's bailout money, while little owners like you and me have little chance of federal relief, making is particularly difficult for us to give refunds and survive. I'll see you over on that other forum... ;)"
"SWL, thank you for your thoughts - they very much mirror mine. I had a vacation rental up until the end of April, but the economics and the risk are just not something I can afford to do any longer, with the shrill demands that if we didn't refund our money we were ""human garbage"" (yes that term was used). All the reasons you gave are so very valid.Because vacation rental owners will more than likely get no government support or compensation for this, I can imagine that the rental market will be a lot, lot smaller once tourism gets back up and running worldwide.Edited: 8:16 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Just to verify LoonMountainMan, do you mean the one that recently completely switched platforms? Do you know me from there because right now everything is so topsy turvy that I can't keep track."
"SWL -- yep -- that's the one. The one that can't be easily read, no longer has mods and probably lost half the people in the transition. ;) I'm tempted to toss in a profanity-laced rant just to see if the mods are still employed!"
"Oh yeah, ridiculous. Did they just seriously toss 9 years of invaluable helpful info and history down the drain without archiving it, along with each user's accumulated points and status? Had to have been to give them a new ""complaint-free"" slate. I bet they're not going to be half as tolerant about negativity toward themselves on this new forum going forward.I see you've been active here a long time too. Are you on any of the AirBnB forums such as https://airhostsforum.com/or https://community.withairbnb.com/ too? Not sure why they have two forums there either."
We had a house in the Keys through VRBO and received a 100% refund from the AWESOME owner!! We plan on rebooking with her as soon as this is over.
"Melinda, very happy that the owner was in a position to give you that refund. Hopefully that owner will still be in business after this has passed and tourism opens up again. I fear that many won't."
Exactly. You can choose to be conciliatory 100% of the time but that's not the same as being a smart business person who keeps it running and secure.
"My husband and I rented two villas for 5/3 - 5/10 in Oahu for us, our children and grandchildren to attend my niece’s wedding. Of course now, the wedding had to be postponed until October. As soon as I had the new dates I contacted the owners hoping we could just move the dates. They initially refused to change the dates but as the quarantine expanded they then said they’d give us a credit. The only problem is they don’t have the villas available for us in October, so that means we are out $9,000 plus we would have to book somewhere else to stay, and that just isn’t in the budget. I tried my best to work with these people.I understand that this is hard for vacation property owners but they aren’t the only ones struggling. If they won’t refund our money we won’t be able to attend my nieces wedding because we can’t afford to book another trip. These ARE unusual circumstances and this pandemic has brought out the best and the worst in people. It makes me very sad that these property owners could keep our money and have a clean conscience. I’m not releasing their names yet because I’m hoping they have a change of heart and do the right thing. Otherwise, we will never use VRBO again and they will be getting 1 star reviews from all six adults who were supposed to go on this vacation."
"Yvonne, by them willing to give you credit toward a future stay you are not losing your money. You can still use it toward $9,000 worth of credit. What is your solution, that it be 100% one-sided in your favor so that the business loses tens of thousands of dollars all at once from everyone from a virus they didn't start, and when their property is still available? It sounds like they are trying to work with you. If you are saying that you want everything to be as if there was no worldwide issue just for you so you are not impacted in any way (although everyone else is) then that is just being selfish and not at all compromising. They bent their rules by offering free credit. Have them reschedule the wedding for a time everyone can use their credit or not have a destination wedding. Did they get a full refund from all the wedding providers they booked? If you won't compromise and don't want to suffer any impact then I'm sorry, but that is not on them.Also, what does it have to do with VRBO? I thought you said it was the owners you had an issue with? How is it VRBO's issue for you to say that you would never book thru them again? Are you saying if you booked directly thru the owners they would have refunded you? I don't understand.Finally, how can you leave a review on VRBO without staying there? I've never heard that before unless they just now changed their rules. How are you able to circumvent the strict rules in order to leave a review for a place you didn't stay in?Edited: 6:11 am, April 23, 2020 "
"Yvonne P, post #65 ->>> These ARE unusual circumstances and this pandemic has brought out the best and the worst in people. <<<Also Yvonne P, post #65 - >>> I’m hoping they have a change of heart and do the right thing. Otherwise, we will never use VRBO again and they will be getting 1 star reviews from all six adults who were supposed to go on this vacation. <<<Classy."
"Yeah, not to mention even if you COULD leave a review for a place you never stayed in (which I've never heard of) you could only leave one review per party/reservation #, not per occupant."
"First, we tried very hard to work with the owners. If this was booked as a vacation with no set agenda, using a credit and rebooking would have been an easy solution. Unfortunately they don’t have the villa available for the rescheduled date. It’s not reasonable to expect us to accept a credit that we cannot use just so they don’t lose money. I understand that everything happening with Covid-19 is not the fault of the rental owners but it’s also not our fault. We are not the enemy here, just people who stand to lose a lot of money with no recourse. The owners have cancelled our reservation due to circumstances out of their control. We also have no control over this situation. I think we can all agree that these truly are unusual circumstances and everyone is trying to navigate how to handle this. Regarding the wedding, yes, my niece was able to either reschedule or get refunds from EVERY SINGLE VENDOR, regardless of cancellation policies. Their willingness to work with her is what prompted her to reschedule the wedding. She assumed (as did we) because of the unusual and unprecedented circumstances the rental property owners would do the same. Again, this is new territory we are all navigating.And finally, to the couple of property owners on this forum who are choosing to be insulting and condescending, please keep in mind that most of us renters don’t know all the ins and out of owning vacation properties. We have rented homes before and have written stellar reviews, but when circumstances out of both the owners and renters control happen, the burden should not be placed on us."
"Yes, it's true that you as travelers don't see the ins and outs. It's easier for us as owners/managers to understand what the travelers' situation is (as we too are travelers) but not for a traveler to understand the ins and outs and what site has what policy and who handles the money, etc. when it comes to vacation rentals, especially when sites are so different and each keeps changing and evolving over the years, much less all the changes in policies and procedures and judgment calls for this issue alone.I can understand the wedding providers willing to reschedule instead of refund. But they too will all go out of business if they lose all the money now and just take it later, but at least it's a compromise. That is why I suggest all owners compromise and offer future credit. If they do and you can't find dates you want that is not a prompt for them to give you a full refund. Just as you worked with the wedding planners and providers to find different future dates that will work, same has to be with the rental owners for future credit. If the owner has other properties he can extend the credit to that is one thing but he can't make all future dates available to you by magic. That is not the nature of the accommodations industry. Just like you worked with the wedding planner and providers for a date that works for you all, the same goes with the owner. After all, they didn't say to the wedding providers we will only reschedule if you can get us only these specific dates and if not forget it. They worked for a mutual date. If you can't or don't do that with the accommodations that is your choice.You say THEY canceled you? If they canceled you without your consent then they owe you a refund. If you requested to cancel due to travel issues with the quarantine or any other reason and they offered you credit then they compromised and were fair. It's unfortunate, but doesn't mean you or anyone else is to blame or responsible or liable. You worked with the wedding planners to arrange new dates instead of with the accommodations which is understandable for a destination wedding, but in that case you may take a loss or just go on a vacation at another time separate from the wedding to at least get your money's worth. Make the best of it as we all are trying to do -- and are all suffering thru this (both with previously confirmed bookings canceled or rescheduled AND with no future bookings for a while)."
"""Unfortunately they don’t have the villa available for the rescheduled date.""OK, but that's hardly their fault either, is it?""I understand that everything happening with Covid-19 is not the fault of the rental owners but it’s also not our fault.""Right, exactly - this is exactly my point - it's neither of your faults, so why is the expectation that one party has to take 100% of the hit for this?""We are not the enemy here, just people who stand to lose a lot of money with no recourse.""Yes, exactly. The owners are in the same situation. They are losing a LOT of money, many times more than any single reservation, and they still have bills to pay. This is a truly horrible situation for all involved.""The owners have cancelled our reservation due to circumstances out of their control.""From your initial account it sounded like you were the ones who had to cancel because the wedding isn't going to happen on those dates, no? Sorry, this is a bit confusing.""We also have no control over this situation. I think we can all agree that these truly are unusual circumstances and everyone is trying to navigate how to handle this.""Yes, very much - the word ""unprecedented"" definitely applies - a lot of people are losing a lot of money right now and some are being forced out of business as a consequence. Trying to find some sort of equitable compromise is definitely recommended, but I feel that your stance that the owner should take 100% of the hit seems unfair to me.The owner will go with their cancellation policy as a baseline here and start negotiating from there. Would a 50/50 split of the financial hurt be considered equitable?""Regarding the wedding, yes, my niece was able to either reschedule or get refunds from EVERY SINGLE VENDOR, regardless of cancellation policies.""And the house owner has offered a reschedule to a date in the future, but they can't magic up availability for specific dates.""And finally, to the couple of property owners on this forum who are choosing to be insulting and condescending, please keep in mind that most of us renters don’t know all the ins and out of owning vacation properties.""I frankly haven't seen any insults. They may be condescending, because they know the owner's side of this and are trying to explain that there is more than one side to this story, you know? IN other threads people (obviously not you) have accused the property owners sitting on big wads of cash that they weren't giving back, yelling that they were entitled to it, and such terms. Property owners are taking a LOT of abuse right now, in addition to the tends of thousands of dollars in financial hits."" We have rented homes before and have written stellar reviews, but when circumstances out of both the owners and renters control happen, the burden should not be placed on us.""Nor should it 100% be placed on the owner, do we agree? Trying to find some sort of compromise would be better."
"TravellingBritNY, I don't know if you read my previous posts or not but yours is almost exactly what I said with all the same points! LOL"
Travel insurance does not cover if the county is closed to nonresidents due to COVID so that money would also be lost.
"""TravellingBritNY, I don't know if you read my previous posts or not but yours is almost exactly what I said with all the same points!""I know - and it's obvious that we all know each other and are working together in Big Rentals, right? :-) There's no WAY that we could have all come to the same point independently....."
"We were refunded for the unused days,in March this year, from the owner (property 15872).Vrbo has been less than helpful and make it very difficult to contract them. They will only provide a portion of their fee, after it has been confirmed the owner has issued a refund. From an owner's email to me, it appears vrbo charges a service fee, a deposit and percentage of the daily rental rate. All of which a renter should be able to recover a portion of four clovid19 situations.As with many companies (I will not use again), vrbo is great when buying a service but terrible when asked for any type of refund.I hope enough people bring attention to vrbo poor business practices and force them to charge or go out of business. Anybody have an alternate method of connecting with renters in Florida (hopefully we can do it next year)?"
"diychas. Sadly, I agree with you. As an owner on VRBO, I have been really saddened by their response. Do this, however -- keep trying with VRBO to get part of your money back. They have a Facebook page where you can write out the whole gory details of their deeds. They tend to respond to those when the laundry is aired in public.And here's a little trick to connect with the owners -- at least some of them -- outside of the platform...Many of us have a private website. We are very hard to find since we are all small players. But if you see a house you like on VRBO, copy one or two of the best pictures on the VRBO ad -- one that looks like the owner would use again everywhere they advertise, Then, do a Google Image Search for that image and see where else it shows up. You may get lucky and find it on the owner's personal page. And... voila! You contact the owner directly and save a few beans.Good luck."
"""I know - and it's obvious that we all know each other and are working together in Big Rentals, right? :-) There's no WAY that we could have all come to the same point independently.....""That's funny, I don't recall me saying that. Copy & paste where I said it. I do think it's strange to say almost the exact same thing right after I posted it without acknowledging it had all been said though, LOL"
"diycha, you can also simply try copying and pasting the owner's headline and Googling it to see if it comes up elsewhere. There are sites like HomeEscape which gives the owner's direct contact info, and also browser add-ons like StaySavr that allow you to see many of the owners' direct email addresses and or phone numbers right on HomeAway/VRBO."
"I'm sorry, SWLinPHX, I misinterpreted your intention of the comment about saying the same thing. I thought that you were amused, and not irritated by it.Apologies. We usually try to back up folks on here by posting our own thoughts on things that often agree with each other. I, personally, consider that a good thing. Wasn't mean to be seen to imitate."
"I agree it's great to back each other up. It's just that you didn't mention that I had just said everything you said in almost an identical message. I was just musing on that in a light way is all. You seemed offended by your sarcastic response. Anyway, no biggie. :)"
"Thx to both LoonMountainMan and SWLINPHX.I hadn't heard of Google Image Search, Home Escape and StaySavr. Will use these technics for next year booking.And I will persist with vrbo for a partial refund for this year. Stay safe and isolated as tolerable."
"Oh heck, no, not offended at all! :-) I was having some fun.It's really nice to have another voice on here - LMM and I have been trying to ""hold the fort"" when it comes to people and their unrealistic expectations of what the VR listing companies do for a while, now. It's gotten significantly worse since COVID-19 came along."
"Yeah, was really bad mid-March when all the sh#t hit the fan with cancellations, guest demands and many OTA's constantly changing policies pulling us in every direction."
"I am afraid you are not the only one experiencing this disgarceful and greedy behaviour. Many owners have graciously refunded potential customers without any fuss but operators like the ones you dealt with are greedy grasping companies. Another company to avoid is Sandy Blue which refuses to deal with any claims for refunds and tells you to look to your insurance comany, many of whom have rejected claims arising from Cornavirus. The Portuguese Government is paying generous salary subventions and there should be no justifiable reason for witholding money which does not belong to them."
I hope you are not dealing with Sandy Blue who will not entertain any refunds.
"Please see the original thread on this topic: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…Or do you have an update, Roger?"
"Unrealistic expectations!!!! Our money is being retained without any justification and the behaviour of companies who are holding on to deposits given in good faith is dispicable and wrapped in self righteous nonsense about needing the money to keep their businesses afloat. As an apologist for these people operating with questionable ethics it must eventually bother you to be attempting to defend the indefensible.To answer your question, yes I have initiated various courses of action to remedy the behaviour of Sandy Blue and would be very confident of a satisfactory outcome for me in several respects."
"Very good, Roger. I hope your outcome is satisfactory for you.Did you see in your original thread as to how the Portuguese Government have changed or clarified the law about cases like yours?https:/…normalThe quote that seems relevant to your case is:""Reservations of accommodation in tourist resorts and local accommodation establishments made directly by the guest, for the same period, which are not made or which are cancelled, entitle the guest to:obtain a voucher of equal value to the payment made, valid until 31 December 2021;reschedule the reservation of accommodation until 31 December 2021, by agreement between the guest and the tourist resort or local accommodation establishment.""So it looks like their law (which may or not may not compliant with EU laws, I suppose a legal challenge would have to go into place to test that) says that you are entitled to either a voucher or a rebooking and that these are legally acceptable.In order to help those that are in a similar situation to yourself and could use some advice in order to get a satisfactory outcome would you care to share the courses of action you have taken? I'd like to make threads like this more constructive and specific so that it can help people through this tough time.Edited: 1:07 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"Thanks for that. I was aware of this and I am also informed that the Portuguese authorities will be offering additional legal guidelines about the circumstance in which cash refunds should be made.There are 2 other steps which can be taken to retrieve your money via credit card companies and debit card operators which are governed by comprehensive EU consumer legislation.Ultimately the greatest damage to rental companies trying to be smart will be reputational damage and in this world of instant information it will not be long before the rental companies who are not playing the game fairly will be outed in a very public manner on a variety of fronts and forums. However, best to wait a little while to see if they might see sense, though I doubt it."
"Roger, are you saying the owner/manager did not offer you future credit or a voucher? Or are you saying something they did or caused is what prevented you from going on your trip? If any of those are true you have a valid complaint and case. If not, you have no basis, sorry.Edited: 4:11 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"I think what people like Roger are failing to consider is what is going on now. If they think back to any other natural disaster or unexpected calamity they would say they would have been refunded. And that may be so, although still that is what traveler's insurance is for and if a traveler opts not to get it then they are saying, ""It is very unlikely I will need to cancel but if I do I will take my chances and lose the money.""However THIS is unprecedented in pretty much everyone's lifetime (include 9/11, etc.). If the disaster had been in the traveler's area then the owner might forgive and out of compassion and refund one or two reservations. Conversely, if the disaster happened in the owner's area and the rental was no longer operable then of course they would have to refund the traveler since they can no longer provide what they promised. But never before has there been an instance where small businesses lost ALL their business (many reservations) from all over the world all at once. A small business can't just refund tens of thousands of dollars without being severely hurt or going out of business, especially when they have not defaulted and are still operational and able to provide what they promised. So if you are comparing this to any past experience, please don't because you can't. Why do you think there are two emergency government funds and so much talk about the economy and small businesses never recovering all across the world? Yes, a traveler may have to miss out or postpone a vacation they already budgeted for and were looking forward to, but at least they don't face going out of business or losing their livelihood."
they need to sell their properties and pay the customers back then. The owner of real property gets the profits and takes the risks. Your implying they should stiff the customer who is renting? Amazing. No more VRBO rentals for me.
"kcfirl -- another first-time poster spouting off about something they know nothing about. Pardon me if I get a little p'oed at your blurt. So, two questions,First, would you kindly refer to the clause in the contract between the customer and owner that explains that the guest gets the money back in this case?Second, if the owner is in the right and is legally allowed to keep a payment -- where do you get off saying they should sell their home to satisfy a guest who is unhappy?If you can't make a constructive comment, please, keep your post count at ""1""."
"WTF ""stiff the customer""??? Where are you getting this? I'm implying that you are held to the rules and if you are not willing to read or understand cancellation policies and contracts or travel insurance or basic common business as a customer then you have no business renting or complaining -- period. Sounds like you think bigger victims are responsible for smaller victims. Unbelievable."
"Hi SWLinPHX, what is your involvement with VRBO? I am just a renter. Perhaps you're a landlord or an attorney for a landord/s since you seem to be such an exert at business law.I'm sorry but there was never anything in the cancellation policy that I read that said my full payment in advance would beheld for a month. My credit card company expects me to pay them on time, so no I'll pay them and someone else has free use of my money for a month.I wonder if it's the Landlord or VRBO? Where is that money sitting now that I've cancelled - per the contract? Thanks, KenPS. basic common business is that when you cancel a contract within the terms of the contract - the reimbursement would be within days or a week at most."

"kcfirl, I'm not disagreeing with anything you just now said. I don't know the details but you are entitled to exactly what the cancellation policy says and, in my personal opinion, if the cause is COVID-19 at least non-refundable credit toward a future stay within the next year if not entitled to a full refund under the cancellation policy. If you canceled most likely HomeAway is holding your money, not the host/owner/manager.Payouts and refunds have been delayed by many OTA's. I've been in the business 16 years and I know the ins and outs of all the major sites and they are all different with different policies, procedures, payment practices, etc. And NOW they each keep altering even those policies. Trust me, hosts & managers are having a very hard time as well. Most booking sites take and hold the money until well after a guest checks in."
"Roger, if you were not eligible for a refund under the cancellation policy and it was not the owner's fault and the place is still available, technically they don't ""owe"" you a refund but I personally feel it is in good faith to compromise and extend the credit for a non-refundable booking within the next 12 months. That is what I have done. Even those who decide to cancel outside our policy get their cleaning fee and damage deposit back at the very least if they are not willing to take credit.I do know colleagues of mine who are short-term rental owners who are taking a hard line and offering nothing, not even rescheduling. That would not sit well with me personally as my conscience would bother me if I didn't try to compromise during this unprecedented time and unusual circumstances."
"Barbara -- what are you talking about? First you say owners should be selling their homes to pay someone (who??) back. Now you show a copy of a message you wrote to the owner (maybe??) as some sort of proof that you deserve a refund.My point (again) is that you are barking about some event without providing any context. Maybe you do deserve a refund, heck, there is no way of knowing, is there?Now, SWL and I, plus a few others are owners. We make no secret of this. We have also both taken very good care of our canceling customers. I cannot speak for him, but I did not have to give refunds as it was still legal to travel. So, please -- stop with the weird comments about being lawyers for VRBO. You should spend a little time reading our posts in this and other threads. You'll see a lot of good advice. If you were to explain your situation in detail, you might even get some good advice too. But telling us we should sell our homes (which I'll probably have to do anyway since all revenue has dried up -- maybe for years) based on no knowledge of the contracts, will not get you very far with this crowd,"
SWLinPhoenizx and loon mountain are either VRBO stoolies or landlords.
"Okay Barbara -- you have just *proven* that you simply blurt without reading... as I said:""Now, SWL and I, plus a few others are owners. We make no secret of this.""We are not ""landlords"", we are vacation rental owners, to be specific.So what? You still have not provided any information about YOUR case, yet, we should sell our homes and write you and your fellow whiners a check. Fine. Please, you are adding nothing but noise to the conversation. I know it's hard being home from school all day, but finish your algebra homework and stay off adult fora."
"""SWLinPhoenizx and loon mountain are either VRBO stoolies or landlords.""Wow, after I just posted empathetically saying I don't disagree with what you said, you go and make some completely ridiculous allegation (which you are welcome to believe because the fact that it is not true probably doesn't matter to you in the least). But what did I say in my last post that is at all unreasonable? Now I don't even find you have any credibility because if you can lie or be so illogical then to be honest it devalues anything else you have to say. You probably aren't even telling the whole story."
"""they need to sell their properties and pay the customers back then. ""Right, because in today's economy property markets are so hot and houses are moving right now. People are just swooping in to buy an investment opportunity that won't give them any payback until.... Bueller...? Bueller...?And, to save you some typing - I used to be a vacation rental owner. Tried to do the right thing to refund our guests their deposits (even though we were absolutely NOT obligated to, according to the law and the contracts in place) and are now out of the business for the foreseeable future. There are other vacation rental owners who have been forced to do the same thing. They did what they considered right, but nobody will ever be booking with them again. Refunding tends of thousands of dollars is NOT something that a property owner can come up with quickly.I get the frustration. These are tough times. The decision sometimes has to be refunding and going out of business, or sticking to the letter of the contract in an attempt to salvage something. Having a property sitting there empty costs money - HOA fees, maintenance, etc. - nobody is ""profiting"" from this mess, and the accusation that people are is hugely offensive, and patently untrue when the facts are examined with even a cursory eye. I know that gets in the way of the narrative of ""greedy property owners won't give me the money back that I think I deserve"" but it's the reality.My guests that wrote back said that they were very happy to get their money back, that they weren't really expecting it and that they would definitely be booking with us again in future. Sorry, won't be possible, Oh well, it was enjoyable for a while... until it wasn't."
"I hear what you are saying. The circumstances are that restrictions placed by the Portuguese Government and the lack of flights into Faro make it impossible to use the premises.I am not asking them to perform the impossible because they clearly cannot make the premises available on any terms which comply with the rental contract. All I am looking for is my money back which is very reasonable in the circumstances. I am aware that Sandy Blue offered an alternative date in September 2020 to someone else and then demanded extra payments because as it is ""usually"" a busier time of the year and according to Sandy Blue the rental should be higher than charged for May. Now if this is not greedy grasping behaviour, then nothing is. If this argument stood up, they should refund the money and let the property at the higher rental to someone else. The reality is that they will be bloody lucky to find anyone to rent anything in September. In my instance Sandy Blue still looked for the ""refundable"" damagedepost of €1,000 after paying them a nearly €3,000 booking deposit before they would cooperate with any potential insurance claims. No matter how generous spirited you are, this kind of behaviour has to be regarded as unacceptble and poorly reflective of an organisation best avoided in the future.Edited: 11:33 am, May 08, 2020 "
"""I hear what you are saying. ""Sorry roger, but based on the rest of the paragraph following this statement it is fairly obvious to me that while you may hear it, you either don't understand it or don't believe it."
So basically you are saying I should suck it up and put it down to a bad experience with Sandy Blue and let them ride off into the sunset with my money. I am not sure of your sense of fair play but what Sandy Blue is trying to do is not honest or fair. Even their behaviour over the damage deposit and their treatment of others by trying to bilk them with increased charges in the current environment for accepting a deferral of their booking to September when nobody will be travelling. Sandy Blue's style of operation is not one of which they can be proud. The rental market in the Villamoura area is not all that big and the word will soon be out about which companies to avoid in the future. Incidentally there have been very good reports of rental agencies and their villa powners behaving in a very fair and reasonable way unlike Sandy Blue.
"""So basically you are saying I should suck it up and put it down to a bad experience with Sandy Blue and let them ride off into the sunset with my money""Nope, that is ABSOLUTELY NOT what I am saying, Roger.Which is why yesterday, in reply to you I wrote ""Very good, Roger. I hope your outcome is satisfactory for you."" when you wrote that you were taking several courses of action to remedy the situation for yourself."
OK I misunderstood you.
Hi - I am having similar issues with sandyblue. My 80 year old mother booked a villa for our family for her birthday. It’s in July. We cannot make it as by then in Ireland she will barely be allowed move 20km from her home. Plus there’s no flight going to faro then. My brother flying in from the states had booked directly with an owner and she has agreed to defer his booking to summer 2021. I think this is fair. My husband’s business has seen an 80% drop in revenues and my salary has been reduced. Everyone has to take some pain and I don’t believe Sandy blue are shouldering their part of the burden. I did send them a cancellation email outside the 63 day window so I am expecting at least they refund monies over and above the deposit amount (which was €1500). In total we have paid €4000. It’s their attitude which is most disgusting I think as they are not looking for ways to help people they are just fobbing people off. If anyone has any other updates Or suggestions I’m happy to hear them
@wirewiper/landlord - the renters are already identifiable right on VRBO. It's not renters who make them oubllic. they chose to be public by renting their properties. Their names and properties are in the public domain on VRBO.
Just so all yo VRBO renters (like me)know - someone is controlling which posts remain on this thread. I posted responses to severalproperty owners on here trying to assuage unlucky renters. I in fact cancelled within the time to get a full refund but I am getting nothing so far. Loonmountainman is a property owner or a VRBO plant...
Sandy Blue appear to be the worst of these operators with absolutely no regard for obligations to their customers. While pursuing a number of legal options everyone who has been treated shabbily by Sandy Blue should not be shy about telling their story and prevent others falling victim to their disgusting and greedy practices.
"KCF....""I in fact cancelled within the time to get a full refund but I am getting nothing so far. Loonmountainman is a property owner or a VRBO plant...""Again, stop being stupid. What you have not yet done is offer any details about your case. How can we possibly offer help or advice. They only thing you shared was that email you sent to someone -- but it had no information about the cancellation -- location -- local restrictions on travel or any of the other factors that would allow the owners here to help you get some or all of your money back.Instead, you want to browbeat me for being exactly what I say I am... an owner. Post real information about your case, we might even help you."
"""Just so all yo VRBO renters (like me)know - someone is controlling which posts remain on this thread.""Oh, for God's sake. Who do you think is in charge? Me? HAHAHA. If you posted personal information about someone else, or were a bit too rude, yeah, your post would be removed. Go out and get some fresh air."
"SWK in ArizonaInitially Sandy Blue refused to entertain vouchers, revised dates or refunds. After a number of weeks of extensive emailing they eventually offered vouchers or deferred revised booking dates which I rejected because I formed the view that a company whtch treated its customers in such a cavalier manner, contrary to the terms of their contract , could not be trusted to honour its vouchers or revised bookings.In the meantime I have initiated various courses of action on which I will report in more detail later. Interestingly their policies seem to have seriously annoyed several customers who are spreading awareness of their experience with Sandy Blue on a number of web sites .Edited: 5:57 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Is ""SWK in Arizona"" supposed to be me or someone else?"
Just received confirmation from Generali that the policy I purchased from them excludes coverage due to the area of travel being shut down by a government action (City Council banned short term rentals). They offered me a voucher to use on a future purchase. I will never do business with Generali again. I'm not sure what it is they actually cover with their policies. It took 8 weeks to get a response.
"Dave G: I agree - I feel that the insurance companies are really letting people down on all fronts with this - people with travel plans are finding out that they have zero coverage because of it, and vacation rental property owners are finding out that their ""loss of business"" insurance doesn't cover it either, because the property hasn't sustained any damage and COULD be rented out.When you read the wording of the contracts there are all sorts of exclusions, and they make the case that this is an exclusion. And everyone is left out of pocket."
"Hi TomA few months back i wrote asking advice about getting appx 4400, back from a VRBO cancellation and travel insurance cancelled because of COVID 9. I was in the first month having quite a bit of trouble. You were kind enough to offer your property in Tahoe. I just wanted to let you know that today, I finally received the final part of the credit in full. It took much back and forth and I don't know why it took so long, but it is over.I just wanted to let you know and again just thank you for being a good person. I hope all is well."

"Monque -- You can't promote your own property here, and it's pretty entertaining to read that you have the ""Aloha spirit"" when you then tell us all about how horrible other people are. ""Aloha"" -- it means, love, hello.... and good bye."
Hello. Guess what. Many of us purchased travel insurance for our VRBO trips. Owners refused to refund. VRBO doesn’t back up the consumer. Insurance says pandemics aren’t covered even if your airline cancels flight and no airline will take you to your destination and your state requires a quarantine. And insurance says sorry. Out of luck. I’ve lost over $20k in airline tickets I’ll likely never be able to use and a home in Italy we won’t be able to use until a vaccination is in place. We are older and not in great health. So yes. There are two sides. On the other hand AirBNB fully refunded the home we were to rent when our airline cancelled and C19 hit. So- my advice. If you are going to rent a home. Make it AirBNB. NOT VRBO!!
"ES -- tell more about your $20k in tickets. You should be getting something back in terms of a refund or credit for future travel.As for AirBnB and VRBO policies -- AirBnB broke the law. Contracts are between owners and guests. The platform does not have any legal standing, however, they do hold the money. When the cancellations were coming in, Air decided to take things into their own hands. I expect there will be a class action suit against them. Most owners, myself included, gave refunds. When I saw what Air did to the owners, I removed my home from their platform. Lots of owners removed their homes. So if you only look there for a home, you'll have less selection -- and I rather doubt that Air will do refunds again in the same fashion.But! You had said that you wired money to an owner. Did you? Or did you pay through VRBO's website with a credit card? If you wired money, then you are not a VRBO customer -- and no, they will not help you. I'm sorry this happened to you, and I hope you get some of your money back."
"Hello- a bit late to the party here but I have two things to say. First- VRBO’s business model is to allow the property owner to manage the rental $. Great for property owner, which Is you Mr LoonMountain Man. AirBNB manages the cash and so, when the COVID crisis happened, AirBNB made a corporate decision to honor the consumer difficulties and fully refunded money to all their travelers. I experienced working with both of these companies when our family trip to Italy fell apart after airlines cancelled our flights and then Italy would not permit US citizens into the country. AirBNB fully refunded our money quickly too for our second week of our vacation. VRBO stepped aside (after HOURS on hold with their awful customer service - out on hold- 3 times for over an hour) and all we have is a voucher for a future trip vs $6k!Second point. We did purchase trip insurance through VRBO. CSA insurance. They carved out pandemics in the policy even though we bought the insurance and rented the villa in 2019 for a trip in 2020. So. Here’s my hard learned advice. DO NOT RENT FROM VRBO! If you have a choice- use AirBNB. Use a credit card. And buy insurance that permits you to cancel for any reason. I learned the hard way and won’t make the same mistake again."
"ES, you are late to the party. Plus, you are off on your facts.Both Air and VRBO serve as advertising platforms and escrow for the funds. The reason they do this is to cut down on scams. So, if you rent and you show up to a parking lot instead of a villa, Air will not release the funds, VRBO will reimburse your. But in both cases, when you use these platforms, you enter into a contract with the homeowner. (Yes, me... and please get off your high horse.)So, the difference between what happened with Air and what happened with VRBO is that Air decided to break the contracts between seller and buyer and decide for the seller what they should do. Air gave money back that they had no right to give. (Yes, so that means the insurance companies for the people who bought insurance got a great deal since there were no claims filed.) Air later decided to give $25 million to ""inconvenienced"" owners... which was somewhere in the range of a 10% of their losses.Now, I will not dispute that it is pretty crappy to pay for a vacation you cannot take. I assure you that it is equally crappy to have thousands of dollars in secured business evaporate. Small operators like me did not get PPP money or any sort of government help. We were screwed. (And if you don't feel sorry for our small businesses, I'll assume you care not about your local shuttered restaurants and retailers.)Now, you can decide to boycott VRBO. But guess what? We owners decided to boycott Air. I immediately took my 5-star property off their platform. So, when you decide to boycott VRBO, you may not see the best selection of homes. Your choice. As I have said about a dozen times -- if all you lost was the price of a vacation, count yourself lucky. Many have lost much more."
