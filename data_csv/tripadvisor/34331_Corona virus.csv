I am traveling to Lima in April and have concerns about this virus. Any input will be appreciated. Thank you
"Please, refer to official sources like the CDC:https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.html"
No cases yet in Peru
"Buy trip insurance and read up. If you are in an at risk category (harder hit portion of the population because of personal characteristics), I would recommend looking into how travel in of itself may increase your risk of exposure. Peru is not an issue at this point in terms of risk of contracting the virus, but if you are in an at risk group, how would you feel about being treated in a Peruvian hospital? Potentially, being quarantined there for weeks?Other than health risks, no one can tell you how the Peruvian government may respond to a broader global outbreak, including travel and other restrictions. Again, buy cancel for any reason trip insurance.I’m going through the same analysis for my family’s trip in July. I have to say, if anyone in my family was in an especially vulnerable group, we would be cancelling and taking a domestic US vacation instead this year given the unknowns."
"welcome,like many scared people, you have your blinders on.what will happen if you get it in the USA?puts a different twist on things.as mentioned above i would look for some travel insurnace that will cover things like that.good luck.Edited: 12:44 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"For relatively healthy people outside of particularly at risk groups, the current information suggests that Coronavirus is not especially dangerous. All indications thus far suggest a pandemic is inevitable. So, if you are from the US and relatively young and healthy, the question in my mind is more about government border and travel restrictions in the US (or in my case, both US and Canada, because my flight departs from Toronto) and Peru, as well as concerns about potential quarantine and medical treatment in Peru, even if you have a relatively mild case. This becomes more of an issue when, for example, you are traveling with young kids and could, potentially, be separated from them as a result of unjustified hysteria. If I travel in the US, and I’m from there, I don’t have nearly as many of these practical concerns. So, the fact that the travel is to another country, especially a developing country, rather than internal to the US, matters.Of course, your point is well taken — no one is going to be able to avoid this virus, whether in the US or Peru or elsewhere. So, buy insurance!"
"Hey wondering if you know anything I don't. This has been my plans for a while now, but yesterday the police showed up to collect everyone's info. Then rumors spread real real fast about possible forced tests on all forieners. Since they lack the proper tests, the were considering a DNA and third party. This was the first time I got scared, bc I can have anything really and be healthy. I am trying to find out if I have any rights.Thanks in advance"
Like even quarenten rights? I don't feel sick at all but that doesn't mean anything
Better wait till the vaccine is ready.
