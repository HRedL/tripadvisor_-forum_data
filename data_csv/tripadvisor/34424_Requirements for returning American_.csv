"I have been stuck overseas since March when all flights got cancelled. There is a flight option to LAX in May. I checked the Department of Homeland Security web site.. the last update about entry restrictions is from mid-March where it talks about people coming from Europe, UK, Ireland, China, or Iran. I am coming from southeast Asia..How can I find information about any restrictions? Is there a mandatory quarantine? I don't know anyone personally who lives in California.. what is the stay home order like?I'm thinking like my plan is to rent an Airbnb for a week or so. Mainly just to catch up on sleep and jetlag and order food online. I am not familiar with Los Angeles at all. I won't be jumping on a domestic flight until I can catch up on sleep after the long trip and have a chance to recover from the jetlag.Any neighborhoods that you would suggest for an Airbnb that wouldn't be too expensive but would also be safe? I see a bunch of Airbnb options but don't even know where to start in terms of neighborhoods. I need something not too expensive and not having to worry about getting robbed and not too far from LAX. I like nature, so if there are any suggestions for nature, not dangerous, not too far from LAX. Or just overall good suggestions. I'm just going to do Uber or Lyft from the airport. Are those still operating?Thanks p.s: I'm not sick and don't have the virus. I wear a mask when I go out and take precautions. The place where I am now is not considered a ""hotspot."" I'm just an American citizen trying to get back to America since all other countries are closed and no other options exist."
"Ahh, another first-time TA poster stranded in some unknown country in Southeast Asia who for some reason has to fly into LAX and take a week to recover from jet lag instead of flying directly to their unnamed hometown. “Bill”, this is completely absurd and obviously fake. Is this the boilerplate script MSS are issuing? How much are they paying you? I hope the TA admins take this down pronto."
"I thought this saga sounded familiar, including the details about wanting to find an Airbnb to hole up for a week. The last one of these was from Portland OR as I recall. Yawn."
Unless there are thousands of Bills in the same situation I'm not sure why your reply is so rude or what you're on about.I don't know where else to post these questions as the Thorn Tree closed down last week.
"Bill, why do you want to stay in LA instead of flying home to your hometown immediately?You only would need a short stop-over in LA, if at all."
"There was a post recently that was virtually identical to this, although they were planning on laying over in LA and then driving to Portland. So your post has enough similarities as to feel like somebody trolling the forums.I can't find that post, otherwise I'd link to it, as there were several responses there. I don't remember anyone mentioning specific restrictions or official quarantine period after arrival. That can change, obviously, and may be up to the individual Immigration official you encounter. I do know the consensus seemed to be there was no advantage to not taking a connecting flight right away, so you could do self-isolating in your own home. (You're not staying over long enough in LA to determine if you're carrying the virus or not, and the more people you encounter, the larger the risk if you do happen to be contagious and asymptomatic.)Uber and Lyft (as far as I know) are still operating. The shelter-in-place rules are pretty similar everywhere:Stay home unless it is absolutely unavoidable to go out. (Your side-trip to LA could be considered unnecessary travel, since you 'could' take a connecting flight home.)If you have to go out (medical appointments, grocery shopping, etc.), it's best to wear a mask and stay at least 6 feet away from other people. When you return home, wash your hands thoroughly.Don't socialize with anyone outside your household. Go out once a day for exercise (roughly 30 minutes, and near your home), following social distancing as above.Edited: 7:57 am, April 16, 2020 "
"LA and California are under stay at home directives. So get home. No reason to linger in LA.KCRW, an NPR station, will have local as well as national and international news."
"Yes, the part about flying back to the US after being stranded elsewhere, coming into LAX and wanting to spend a week at an AirBnB to recover from jet lag is exactly the same as a previous poster. That's one heck of a coincidence. My advice to you is the same as to the previous poster. It would be best to go directly home - wherever home is. There are domestic flights, so no reason to stay in LA - and no one needs a week to recover from jet lag before traveling on. Depending on flight schedules, you might need to overnight in a hotel near LAX, but don't stay any longer than that."
"I don't know if this OP and the drama trauma filled previous OP are the same.There is nothing in LA for you. Overnight at a LAX hotel if you have to, but get home and out of California."
Provided you are a US citizen or PR. You didn't state what passport you hold.
"He did say in his thread title that he is a returning American, so I assume US citizen and US passport holder - but yes, it is important detail that could change things."
Also returning from where (which country) makes a difference.
Here is the recent thread with the very similar story. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g32655…Both should be taken down by TA Admins.
"I don’t think taking down the messages is necessary, because the bottom line response message is clear.California and LA and all places in California are under stay at home directives. If you don’t have a home to stay in in California, then expeditiously transit out of your arrival airport to your home.....which might have different directives."
The Terms of Service don’t allow people to pretend to be someone. You have to be a real person. No American would ask questions in such a scripted way. An American in this type of circumstance would reach out to the local American consulate. Why answer questions from users who aren’t real? The coin of the realm here at TA is candor. Many authoritarian governments use public forums to monitor and manipulate public opinion. They hire people (i.e. pay them) to masquerade as locals. This looks like a blatant attempt to use TA as part of disinformation efforts.
Contact the American Embassy. I'd think Airbnb business would a stay at home business order.
"Unless you were in China, there are no special restrictions upon entry. Any person traveling from abroad is told to self-quarantine for 14 days, but they obviously cant track that or do anything but the honor system. You aren't marched off in handcuffs and held under arrest. The only people that has happened to are ones in a known virus outbreak situation, like the people on those cruiseships, who are made to quarantine at a certain spot. I know travelerd from China (HUbei province) were made to quarantine 14 days but I don't know if even they were kept in one spot. Doesn't matter if you haven't been to China, anyway. Nobody returning home as an American from some foreign country is forced to stay at the airport location if they have a connecting flight to another city where they live, if they are not known to have COVID-19 (like those cruise ship people).This doesn't make any sense about stopping in LA for a week even though you don't know anyone there. There is zero purpose to that. Go home wherever that is."
"Unless you were in China, there are no special restrictions upon entry.Also from Iran. Pretty sure it's political, as there is no restriction of people coming back from high infection countries like Italy or England."
