"We were looking to come to MB next weekend(March 20-23) and I was surprised how much rooms are - OF, King - many are $150+ a night. One hotel was $220 for Fri and Sat nights, but $90 for Sun. It's been many years since we've come to MB in early spring, but are these typical prices now, or is there something going on that weekend."
I cant speak to all specific rates but I have seem ads for discounts. Call the resorts you are interested in I would think you will get a good deal.
"Especially now, when most folks are staying home, due to Coronavirus."
Please don’t travel now. Virus reported in Myrtle beach. Things are shutting down. CDC is advising against travel.
"I think due to the fact that internatuonal travel is mostly banned, cruising is banned I would travel domestically. SC has very few cases and a beach vacation allows you a lot of space. Take smart precautions but life goes on. I will be travelling down in late April or early May.Edited: 4:48 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"More things are shutting down in SC, schools are closed until at least 3/31.This is not the time to travel anywhere."
"Travel by private car is as safe as staying home. You'll find crowds are down, rates are low - but also some shopping inconveniences, and restaurants, bars, etc., might close down."
"Believe me, you want to keep the numbers down, that’s the point of not going anywhere! You don’t want more people traveling into Myrtle and North Myrtle Beach as that’s just going to raise the chances of spreading the virus. You can have it for 2 WEEKS and not even know you’re spreading it to someone else. I know quite a few snow birds go to the Carolina’s during this time of year. The last thing they need is people flooding the area and not knowing if they’re sick. EVERYONE needs to stay home!!"
Recommend not vacationing at this time.
Restaurants in SC have been mandated to close.
AS a RN healthcare provider I implore PLEASE take the advisement of not traveling. There are valid reasons for these restrictions in place
What are the restrictions for domestic travel?
From the CDC website https:/…travel-in-the-us.htmlYes right now there are no mandatory restrictions for domestic travel just wish people heed the warnings for hopefully a temporary disruption in our lives
I was wondering when you said travel restrictions about MB that I missed something. Thanks
Don't travel right now regardless of how cheap it is. Countries don't purposely shut down entire economies over little issues. This thing is real and the only way to save the sick is to slow infection rates by moving when only absolutely necessary.
