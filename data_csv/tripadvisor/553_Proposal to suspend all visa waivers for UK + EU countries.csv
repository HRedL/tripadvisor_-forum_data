"https://vnexpress.net/thoi-su/viet-nam-thuc-…I'll post an English version if I find one. Not sure if the 'proposal' to suspend exemptions has been put into force, but anyone planning to travel on a visa waiver should check their situation.Tales on reddit of Europeans being turned back at Bavet border gate yesterday."
English version is as following : https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-mu…
UK FCO warning that change could come in at short noticehttps:/…entry-requirementsI'd be considering getting a pre-approved visa letter as 'insurance' if I were travelling soon in case the visa waiver is suspended.
"The FCO have officially updated their website to say that Vietnam is planning on suspending the visa waiver programme for UK passports holders and this link appears to show that it has happenedhttps://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/informat…It says ""Vietnam has temporarily suspended visa exemptions for citizens of the UK, EU, South Korea and Italy, as well as other countries with more than 500 confirmed cases of COVID-19""I am supposed to be flying to Vietnam on 16th March under the visa waiver programme. Does anyone know whether this means that we can use the Visa on Arrival programme or that we are unlikely to get a visa approved and will have to cancel the trip?"
"So this is for up to 15 days waiver, there is no clean rig you have an E-vise for up to 30 days which we have. so if you have a E-visa can you still enter after the medical declaration is passed. A bit confusing,Edited: 4:21 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Unfortunately on the E-visa website it says -""Temporarily stop issuing e-Visa for foreigners who are in or have recently visited areas where Covid-19 is spreading."" so this in not an option for us."
I’m flying on the 21st and was relying on the waiver too but now planning on using VOA. Following the FCO and sites provided on here I don’t see anything that says we would be denied entry (yet).
"Flissy, thanks for your response. I can't find anything either saying we would be denied but am finding it a bit confusing now and still want to travel."
"Just phoned the Embassy in the Hague, not going yet but need visas for half may, employee told me to keep an eye on the information and wait getting the visa."
"I don't know. We are in same situation as you. I applied for letters of approval last night and when I checked my emails this morning they had already been sent to me. Very efficient. I, like you, just hope they will be accepted for VoAs when we get there."
"We are due to go on TUI's Mekong Delta tour and then a week in Phu Quoc, starting tomorrow 10th March. Anyone else out there in the same situation? We were going via the Visa Waiver 15 day scheme. Will we be allowed in? We live in UK. Not enough time for an e-visa, says it needs 3 days, and would that be good enough anyway?"
"Hi,I’m planning to travel to Cambodia 25th March then onto Vietnam on 1st April on my honeymoon! We were also planning on using the visa waiver but it’s looking unlikely now. What is a letter of approval and how might I go about getting one? We are thinking of applying for the evisa. Does anyone else have any thoughts?"
"> Will we be allowed in? Yes, if they don't change anything before then. But if the UK tips over 500 cases, who knows. They gave two days notice when they suspended Italian visa waivers. That's maybe an indication but not a guarantee that they'd do the same next time.> We live in UK. Not enough time for an e-visa, says it needs 3 days,Well, you could get an urgent pre-approved visa letter from the likes of vietnamvisapro.net in as little as a few hours."
"> What is a letter of approval and how might I go about getting one? Pick a cheap reliable agency like vietnamvisapro.net Follow the instructions.We are thinking of applying for the evisa. Does anyone else have any thoughts?That might work. Nobody really knows what the future holds. The E-Visa folks say:> Temporarily stop issuing e-Visa for foreigners who are in or have recently visited areas where Covid-19 is spreading.But they don't say which areas they mean. China, Iran. Italy for sure. UK? Maybe not. Maybe soon. Nobody can say."
"Hi all,I emailed the Vietnamese embassy in the UK and have just received a response. They have said all passport holders now need a visa to enter Vietnam. This suggests that provided you have a visa, you should be good to go! They have advised that an express next day service is available."
"Liz D we too are on the same flight as you but doing the Essential South East Asia tour. Before the Corona Virus had really got hold I had obtained an evisa for our first entry into Phu Quoc. I was then going to use the 15 day visa waver when we flew back from Cambodia to Phu Quoc but now I'm a bit worried incase it does get suspended and we are not allowed back into Vietnam.I have just spoken to Tui tours who where unaware of the possibility of this suspension, even though it is now on the FCO website! I am awaiting a phone call back.I don't know now whether to use the 15 day visa waiver upon landing(if still available) instead of evisa and then get Visa approval letter for Visa on arrival back at Phu Quoc after our tour. That's assuming the Vietnamese will let UK nationals in. Manatdollar are you able to clarify if I can get a 15 day visa waiver on first entry to Phu Quoc instead of using evisa?"
> Manatdollar are you able to clarify if I can get a 15 day visa waiver on first entry to Phu Quoc instead of using evisa?Was definitely the case before the current Covid-19 thing kicked off. No idea if that's the case right now or if it will still be the case tomorrow.You just needed to tell the immigration office what you wanted and show proof of travel out of Vietnam before the end of the 15th day.
"…chinhphu.vn/Home/…39094.vgpSo, there's your answer."
"Thanks, so it looks like 15 day visa waver has now been definately suspended."
"I had a trip planned for 18th April. I was entering via Ho Chi Minh with a visa waiver, travelling to Cambodia next day and coming back to Da Nang 3 days later with a visa which I already have confirmed. What are my options now?"
"""I have just spoken to Tui tours who where unaware of the possibility of this suspension....""Why am l not surprised after all their other incompetencies.Blows me away that people actually use them.Scott"
"""What are my options now?""VOA?As has been mentioned. Scott"
"""VOA? As has been mentioned.""Can I have a single entry VOA followed by an eVisa? Do I need to buy a multy entry?"
I have an E visa so I assume this won't stop me from gaining entry later this month?
"I guess that depends what ""Vietnam also temporarily stops issuing e-Visa for foreigners who are in or have recently visited areas where Covid-19 is spreading"" means ..."
> I have an E visa so I assume this won't stop me from gaining entry later this month?Who knows? Things are changing pretty fast.
"Hi Scott I have used Tui tours on several occasions without any problem. We use them for convenience, I don't have the time to research and book all the different elements of a touring holiday. There are far too many destinations out in the world to go and see and time unfortunatley is not on my side! I also book with them in case anything goes wrong whilst on holiday, be it corona virus, ash cloud (yes we where affected by that), terrorist attacks.....the list goes on. I know that they will provide extra accommodation if required, and repatriate as soon as possible, instead of having the worry of being in a foreign country and having to pay for extra hotel nights and a flight home myself!"
"Hi Tiger8MiddleEngland, please keep posting if you hear from TUI, I can't get through. Can we email each other off of TripAdvisor?"
"Hi Liz I can send you a message via the inbox, top left hand corner"
"Liz message sent, inbox top right hand corner!"
How do you get letters of approval? We should be travelling on Sunday but would need a visa.
"""Can I have a single entry VOA followed by an eVisa? Do I need to buy a multy entry?""Yeah, you can do that.Assuming corona issues haven't changed things.Of which there have been several. A multiple entry VOA is also an option.And maybe a better one.Scott"
"> How do you get letters of approval? go to vietnamvisapro.net Follow instructions. There are many other visa agencies, but they are a s good as any and as cheap as any."
We're already in Vietnam and have a flight booked to Phu Quoc on the 11th. We were allowed in on the Visa exemption this morning. A long shot I know but does anyone know if we would be fine getting on to Phu Quoc?
"""How do you get letters of approval?""From a VOA agent.Try vietnamvisapro.net And read the pinned post at the top of the forum page.Scott"
> would be fine getting on to Phu Quoc?That's like going from London to the Isle of Wight. You don't go anywhere near immigration.
"""A long shot I know but does anyone know if we would be fine getting on to Phu Quoc?""Be surprised if you weren't, seeing as PQ is part of Vietnam and all.But it's very much a changing world atm....ScottEdited: 6:57 am, March 09, 2020 "
"""That's like going from London to the Isle of Wight. You don't go anywhere near immigration.""Cool, thank you for the responses :)"
Thanks Scott.I will wait until a week before departure to make a decision. I really want to go but things are developing rapidly for the worse.

"Update on visa situation for people from europe ing uk.https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/informat…basically the waver is suspended for the country listed, not sure what impact this has on those with a 30 day e-visa will try to get some info from embassy in uk."
"E mail from Embassy in london. If you have a visa, in my case E-visa then as long as you pass the medical screening you can enter Vietnam. This may well change in the coming few days !!!"
"Another update. New email just received states the following, so I suspect that unless you have a visa you will not be getting one for a while.Dear Sir/Madam,From now on, we closed all type visa (e-visa and VOA). All passengers need to apply the visa through the Viet Nam Embassy in the world"
"Just spoken to TUI head office and they refer to the Foreign Office website for advice www.gov.uk and say that, as stated, Vietnam is thinking of suspending the visa waiver on arrival system for UK etc, but hasn't yet done so. So all trips to Vietnam are still on. We're flying tomorrow, so fingers crossed..."
"""Just spoken to TUI head office...""Shaking head stuff.And you pay them?Appalling. Scott"
"> From now on, we closed all type visa (e-visa and VOA)There's been nothing on .chinhphu.vn or on the E-Visa site. If they hadn't lied for years about the dangers of pre-approved visa letters they'd be more credible.Maybe there will be an official announcement early tomorrow. Who knows these days."

"> they refer to the Foreign Office website for advice www.gov.uk and say that, as stated, Vietnam is thinking of suspending the visa waiver on arrival system for UK etcWell, the fco site always lags since they can only update after an official announcement by the Vietnamese. They updated at 7:18am, 9 March 2020 to say visa waivers might be suspended ""at short notice"". I'm expecting another update early tomorrow morning."
Gov’t temporarily suspends unilateral visa exemption for 8 countries due to COVID-19 outbreakthis link tgvn.com.vn/govt-temporarily-suspends-unilat…
> Gov’t temporarily suspends unilateral visa exemption for 8 countries due to COVID-19 outbreakYes. I posted a link back at post #17.
"Yeah...I also emailed the embassy and they said pretty much the same thing “Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for your email. Please apply for the visa as soon as possible as we will soon stop the 15 day visa exemption and after that we may not be able to issue visa.” At £77 x2 and then £12 postage the embassy visa is a bit more costly than VOA so it would be useful to have a definitive answer."
I would not trust the embassy. I wrote them in October when there were no issues and they told me that I should buy the visa through them and would not be able to use the waiver followed by an evisa for two entries...
> would be useful to have a definitive answerWell.... you could email a few other embassies where there were previously visa waivers and masquerading as a national of that country ask them.Be interesting to see if you get the same answer. I'll put $5 on getting different answers. :-/
"Liz DI would get back on the phone to them... Unless you have a visa the reply I received from the london office stated suspension of E-Visa application, VOA, and the visa waiver. I the asked if my E-visa issued last year for my trip would still be valid and allow entry after medical screening they replied the it was valid and would allow entry. I hope this will be of assistance, they also stated that you would have to apply to your local embassy for a visa now."
Hi Where did you apply for letter of approval?
"who me ? no E-visa last year going for 28 days, hopefully !!!"
"Hi we are supposed to be arriving into phu quoc on Tuesday 11th 1st time to Vietnam so never had a previous visa , what do you think our chances of entry are?Spoke to tui and they say they are looking into visa options."
"Hi Coprolite54, letter of approval was through www.vietnamvisapro.netEdited: 10:09 am, March 09, 2020 "
"> so never had a previous visa Were you planning on staying on Phu Quoc? They *didn't* say that the 30 day Phu Quoc exemption was being suspended. No idea if they meant to include it or if they have plans to do so. As far as I know, you can still get a pre-approved visa letter from the likes of vietnamvisapro.net Might need to be expedited, but they can do that. Or could before everything kicked off.Edited: 10:10 am, March 09, 2020 "
We won't really know till we arrive in Vietnam on Wednesday (11th) morning local time. TUI at the moment say to go as arranged
We were planning on flying to da nang but could cancel onward travel and book hotel in phu quoc.Thanks for your help I'll have a look into it now.
"We also fly tomorrow, we have not pre obtained Visas, as in theory we did not need them. I guess it could change between then and now, we are packing regardless, if not able to go then we may just buy a ticket and go somewhere else. I suppose if you cannot travel you get a refund if you are on a package. As said before if anyone hears different re tomorrows flight and entry, please let us know. The last thing we want is to fly there and not be allowed in. Is it just me, bu what difference is the visa free bit make anyway, $50 ?"
"A few of us in the same situation, i looked at getting the letter on one site and Phu Quoc did not come up."
We have evisa currently and was using visa wavier to enter leaving after 9 days and heading to Cambodia for 3 nights returning to Hanoi for the f1 using the evisa.Where is it best to apply for the visa approval letter from? Our holiday at the moment is turning into a bigger nightmare as the days go by.
"> A few of us in the same situation, i looked at getting the letter on one site and Phu Quoc did not come up.vietnamvisapro.net has Phu Quoc just fine. But it doesn't really matter - pre-approved visa letters say ""pick up visa on arrival at international airports""."
"I do question the logic of making people from visa waiver countries start paying for a visa, how does that improve the coronavirus situation? Are they hoping people will say ""Ah I'll just write off the £1500 holiday because I don't want to pay for a visa""?Or are they just looking to scam people out of more money. Probably both."
"Hi I applied for the eVisa last week. The same message was up ""Temporarily stop issuing e-Visa for foreigners who are in or have recently visited areas where Covid-19 is spreading."" though our visa was processed and we have it now. It might be worth trying this."
> Or are they just looking to scam people out of more money.Or do they want to find out where they've been /before/ they grant them a visa which allows them to travel to Vietnam Vietnam rather than people just turning up having previously travelled who knows where?I think the Vietnamese have done a stunning job on Covid-19. I've no problem giving them the benefit of the doubt on this.
"Hi, 4 of us also due to fly tomorrow... waiting on a call from tui, however, if they say fly as normal then we have no visa, we may well get turned away. The tui lady told me if we cancel now then we are looking at full loss of costs. What?!?! Basically, Option 1: the gov says not safe to fly - so full refund.Option 2: If the gov says yes, then possible non-admission and ruined holiday plus loss of costs?Option 3: cancel now to avoid disappointment, and full loss of costs =/I willl post as soon as I hear anything, others please do the same! many thanks."
"VOA is the only option, if possible - from where we stand.Edited: 10:45 am, March 09, 2020 "
We will be as you in a week's time. Hope it works out for you tomorrow. Please let us know what happens.
I suggest you apply for expedited VOA's
> Or do they want to find out where they've been /before/ they grant them a visa which allows them to travel to Vietnam Vietnam rather than people just turning up having previously travelled who knows where?I think the Vietnamese have done a stunning job on Covid-19.

"> VOA is the only option, if possible - from where we stand.What do you mean? A Visa Waiver or a pre-approved visa letter? There is no 'VOA' in Vietnam.You can get an urgent pre-approved visa letter from the likes of vietnamvisapro.net (phone them up first to make sure they can hit your deadline).Possibly there's a grace period of a day or two before the visa waivers are suspended, but I've seen nothing written down. Goodness knows how it works if the suspension was immediate, given there were people already in the air."
The e-visa turnaround is very fast. They state 3 days but in reality it was 1 day. If this is still an option it might be worth trying.
Do we actually know if this visa letter approval will still allow us to enter?Can we have 2 single entry visas or should we have a multi entry visa? Bearing in mind we already have a single entry visa in place for out travel?? Jenny
"From my understanding, this is currently a proposal which will be most likely implmented. I fly out on Wednesday and have applied for an e-visa"
"I have the very same question Jenny, as my travel arrangements are very similar to yours. Going to Ho Chi Mihn, then Cambodia and back to Vietnam via Da Nang and already have an evisa for the second leg. If you could please let me know how does it go for you since I am travelling at a later date.Edited: 11:05 am, March 09, 2020 "
"> From my understanding, this is currently a proposal which will be most likely implmented. Well, it was a proposal /yesterday/. Today, it's an *announcement*:> The Government has decided to temporarily suspend visa-wavier program for citizens from Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Spain amid complicated developments of the COVID-19 epidemic.No mention of a grace period or if it's immediate."

Are they hoping people will say ""Ah I'll just write off the £1500 holiday because I don't want to pay for a visa""?--------------Getting a visa from the embassy takes time. But saying that there is no guarantee you'll still be well by the time it arrives! Given that e-visa entry is starting to be hit, it wouldn't surprise me if VOA visas also get stopped. As Manat says watch this space. And that is all you can do.One thing, if you are flying out, whether with a tour company or not, and expecting to use the visa exemption, you will probably be stopped from boarding. I would seriously question whether you would even arrive in Vietnam if you haven't got a visa already.Myself, I'm holding off until it all blows over - the immigration situation is changing far too rapidly for my liking."
"I doubt the Vietnam Government need that money, what screws it is not knowing if we get in or not, no realclarification."
"Im not going til Friday 10th April, won't be doing anything for a few weeks minimum."
"Just seen this posted by a Travel agent friend, for anyone due to travel tomorrow, i have not clarified this ""I’ve rang the embassy it’s from the 12th March onwards so luckily our customers who arrive on 11th just scrape through x"" I hope its true"
"> I hope its trueMe too, but how hard would it be for the embassy to update their website? Makes sens since some people would already have started travelling."
We are supposed to land at phu quoc on Wednesday 11th so hopefully get in before it starts but will we need a visa to travel from Phu Quoc to Da nang 3 days later?
"> will we need a visa to travel from Phu Quoc to Da nang 3 days later?Not if you have a visa or make sure to get the 15 day Visa Waiver rather than the 30 day Phu Quoc Exemption. Just make it clear to the immigration officer. If you get the 30 day Phu Quoc Exemption by mistake, kiss Da Nang goodbye. You'll be stuck on the island."
It says only visas from the embassy. ... vietnamembassy.org.uk/index.php…

Let us know how you get on with the evisa Adem. I’m still curious *exactly* what the message on the home page means so I’m reluctant to pay $50 for it just to be denied.
> Let us know how you get on with the evisa Adem. I’m still curious *exactly* what the message on the home page means so I’m reluctant to pay $50 for it just to be denied.I submitted the application when the offices closed so I'm hoping to hear back tomorrow morning. I spoke to my tour guide company and they advised to apply for an E-Visa and that someone got a visa approved today. If i can't get an E-Visa I suspect I can't fly out on Wednesday
i suggest you try vietnamvisacorp.com i think you can get a visa within hours which will then be stamped on arrival
It is possible to get an emergency visa on arrival in 30 minutes to an hour by paying an additional fee. Try company called VietnamEVisa
"It is possible to get a visa on arrival letter in 30 min to 1 hour by paying an extra fee, around $60 in total Try website do VietnamEVisa"
"So basically.... I've been to the store and collared a manager because the advise i had been given was wrong and the other store who is closest to me who were dealing with me since 10am today, basically fobbed me off with a 24 duty manager number who will (apparently) contact me if anything changes.Anyway back to the point, they have basically said, as of yet, it is not official and it is just a PLAN, this suspension might happen in 4 hours, 4 days or 4 months. If I cancel at this stage I will be subject to full T&C's and we will lose the lot, OR go and try our luck and maybe have a really good holiday, which if rejected entry or worst case quarantined then they would look at our case, and then look to see if a refund will apply or rebook our holiday. In short, good luck to us all flying tomorrow, and of course all those yet to fly in the weeks to come. My opinion, and only my opinion of course..... after reading the face of the manager when asked directly ""would you go?"". I would say cancel while you are only subject to the loss of your deposit. It might be that we get in fine, but we are completely chancing it, and only because it's all or nothing in our situation with regards to money."
"IMO no one should cancel as you'll waive your right to any insurance claim. Let your company cancel or wait until the Foreign Office says you can't go, that way you will get a full refund one way or another."
I am travelling in Vietnam for 28 days so already had ordered an Evisa some time ago. Is this still valid in light of recent events and changes to the visa requirements. I would prefer to avoid having to order another evisa via the Embassy if my previous version is adequate. The current advice is ambiguous. Any feedback and practical advice is very welcome please
"Good evening everyone, I’ve got a question for all of you : we should travel to Hanoi on Wednesday 11th of March -arriving in Hanoi on the 12th. My mum and I are French, my boyfriend is Dutch; he has got a visa and because we are supposed to stay less than 15 days, we were exempted of any visa... it’s seems that the situation is changing but we would love to have a concrete answer about the status of our trip! Do you think we can still be accepted in Vietnam? Do we need to get a visa? If so, do you have any website to recommend to get it as fast as possible? Thank you for any answer"
Hi if we have an E-visa and are landing in phu quoc will it be valid for travel to da nang or will we need a different one?
> Hi if we have an E-visa and are landing in phu quoc will it be valid for travel to da nang or will we need a different one?Yes. Phú Quốc and Dạ Nang are both part of Vietnam so an E-Visa covers them both. If you enter on an E-Visa you should be able to go anywhere in Vietnam unless there are areas closed due to Covid-19
"> we would love to have a concrete answerWouldn't we all. Talk of it coming in on 12th March:https:/…105941451But it's a bit vague and I've seen nothing official. The suspension of the Italian visa waivers started at 12:00 2 days after it was announced, so you've maybe got until midday Vietnam time on the 12th to get in. Or it might be closed before then. Your guess is as good as anyone's until there is official guidance.You can get a pre-approved visa letter pretty quickly from vietnamvisapro.net if you pay enough. Ring them up to make sure they can hit your deadline. There are agencies who offer a 15 minute turnaround for a small fortune, but I know how they work and I've never used them and have none to recommend."

That email is an automatic reply as I got the exact same message from them asking a simple question. I’m waiting to see how it is for someone going in the next day or so before paying out extra costs for more visas.
"That has crossed my mind as well, I might try the $25 e-visa and see what happens as that is not so much to lose if it doesn’t work. Hopefully someone posts on here by the end of the week r.e their experience at the border as I will have to apply Friday regardless."
The revisits says evisa’s are not being processed at the moment
vietnamvisapro.net Are not issuing letters for UK for VOA. Tried last night email this morning to say this isn’t possible
I’m sorry to hear that. We got ours day before yesterday from them. Mind you I wonder if they’re even still going accept them at the airport when we get there ...

Do we know why they won’t let them fly out to Phu Quoc??
"I've been trying to get in touch with Vietnam airlines to find out if we need to get a proper visa from the embassy or whether our e-visa is still acceptable for travel. The embassy is saying the E-Visa won't be accepted, Vietnam airlines have replied with an (I assume) generic message which doesn't really answer the question (copied below):""Vietnam has temporarily suspended visa-free travel from eight European countries over corona-virus fears. People from the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden will no longer be given visa waivers until further notice, its government said on Monday.Please contact or email Vietnamese Embassy in London to request a emergency VISA.""I wish someone could provide clarity so that we know whether a) we need to get an emergency visa from the embassy and b) if we try to do that whether we'll even get one!"
Yes please let us know the reason for not being allowed to fly as this could be the same case for a lot of us waiting.Thanks
"We're flying to HCMC tomorrow, but do have e-Visas already issued. However I spotted this site saying e-Visas will no longer be accepted: https:/…. It s just a blog so nothing official, but it's normally pretty reliable. Has anyone had official confirmation that e-Visas will still be accepted?"
"Richard and Jenny thanks for your input - keen to hear what happens with you as it will inform a lot of us. We have an e-visa and VoA letter, but unclear whether they'll be accepted....Would be great to know whether full on embassy visas are being accepted too..."
"So sorry for your mum and all those other passengers. What a nightmare. Surely this is info TUI should have found out once the proposal was first even mentioned you’d think!!Edit: Also thanks. Definitely going for the embassy visa now. Though think I’ll leave it as late as I possibly can next week with the way things are going.Edited: 6:39 am, March 10, 2020 "
"The suspension comes into effect from 12th March so most likely the TUI flight would have arrived in Vietnam before this, so I wonder why they thought the Vietnamese govt won't let them fly in."
Thanks for the update! We are travelling to Cambodia on 25th March then onto Vietnam on 1st April. We were planning on using visa exemption but will apply for a visa via the embassy. Luckily I upgraded our travel insurance so we are now covered for cancellation/cutting short if we can’t travel as a result of a decision made by an official body due to the virus.I think we will leave the visa application for a few days and see what is happening then. We are getting married next Saturday so I don’t want to leave things too late and I can imagine the Vietnamese embassy is about to get an increase in visa applications! It would be great to know if any UK citizens gain entry to Vietnam in the next few days and on which visa!
"Someone has just messaged me on twitter - they're at the embassy in London and those going to collect tourist visas today are not being given them.Edited: 7:52 am, March 10, 2020 "
Hi Lucy do we know why they are not being given them? I bet if we apply and pay they will take the money without refund if they do not grant them. I wonder if more going on than we currently know about.
I’m at the London embassy and they’ve just issued a statement. All existing visas including eVisas are OK. But no new visas will be issued except through organised tour operators as they can ensure care is provided if needed. The website will be updated very soon.
Thanks Richard great help but wonder what that means for people that were using visa wavier then e visa later in the trip.
vietnamembassy.org.uk/index.php…
So they won’t issue you one themselves but say you can get one from a tour operator?!
We haven’t booked with a tour operator so where does that leave us?
> So they won’t issue you one themselves but say you can get one from a tour operator?!The tour operator will apply for a letter on your behalf. I imagine that means you need to be on a tour and not travelling independently.
"I applied for the tourist visa this morning after being told by the embassy yesterday to apply, travelling independently though so guess that means paid £70 for nothing?!"
"Hi Richard. Unfortunately that's not what the website update says - it says that tourists should take their visa on arrival letters to the UK embassy for 'assurance', and that no new visas will be issued from scatch, even from the embassy. My girlfriend has a VoA letter so she'll be taking that + passport tomorrow to try and get the formal visa approved here. I have an approved e-visa, the position on that remains unclear...hopefully will clear up later today / tomorrow morning."
"I am planning on travelling into Vietnam from Thailand with 2 friends on 2nd April for the F1 race, I guess I am not going to be able to get a visa."
"Hi all,We are due to travel to Hanoi on the 3rd April and have been following this post. Thank you to all that have contributed, it's been really helpful. This is very disappointing. We were going to the embassy next week to apply (as we were going to travel under the visa waiver). I called our travel insurance and we are not covered! Only if the FCO advises onlt essential travel to Vietnam. We haven't booked through an operator. Flights directly with BA and hotel bookings are separate (and we were also going to the F1). Does anyone know if airlines can help? I have emailed the embassy to ask what people not using a tour operator can do. I will report back when I get an answer."
"> t says that tourists should take their visa on arrival letters to the UK embassy for 'assurance'I don't think it's even that clear.> For those who wish to travel to Vietnam, they need to contact with their Vietnamese sponsors/tour-operators for arrangement of their visas with the Immigration Department of Vietnam. Once they get the visa approval letter from the Immigration Department, they can contact Vietnam Embassy for the issuance of their visas."
Alter please let us know how your partner get on and what the process will be for yourself also?
"Yes manatdollar, it seems very unclear. If I turned up at the embaassy tomorrow I'm don't think I'd hold out much hope of getting what I need out of them. It's frustrating as I need to decide whether to call this a sunk cost, change flights, and go somewhere else..."
"I asked at the embassy today about eVisas and they said if you had one already issued you were ok. It would be honoured. They were quite clear on this, however I won’t be 100% confident until I’m through immigration at HCMC."
The embassy told me they will refund my visa applied for yesterday.
The embassy told me they will refund my visa applied for yesterday.-----------------------------------------------So effectively anyone without a current visa can't get in?This contradicts what they said in the latest update today about a tour operator getting it for you
visa applications through tour operators will still be accepted according to visa staff at the embassy this morning. But if you’re travelling independently and haven’t got a visa yet then you have a problem
"I am travelling on an Intrepid tour, my flights were booked separately through an agent. This implies I have to contact Intrepid to get me a visa?"
"I'm travelling independently of a tour operator and due to fly on Saturday.We applied for e-visas last night, I've checked the status this morning and they are still in process. Fingers crossed this gets approved or I think I'm stuffed."
Thanks Flyer. Any idea what their position is on VoA letters that have been given in advance?
"Hi,This thread has been super helpful to understand the situation. I came to Vietnam from the UK on 6th March and we will be getting flights around Vietnam. As we will be heading to the airport on the visa waiver programme (eg from HCMC to Hanoi) do you think we will be refused entry at Hanoi even though I'm in Vietnam already? Many thanks, Eric"
"> do you think we will be refused entry at Hanoi even though I'm in Vietnam already?No, because you won't go anywhere near immigration - it's a domestic flight."
"For those travelling independently, and planning on maybe taking a Ha Long Bay (or similar) guided tour while within Vietnam as part of their itinerary = tour operator ?"
"> No, because you won't go anywhere near immigration - it's a domestic flight.I was considering another route to get to Hanoi like Bourne Identity but I'll trust you. Thanks!Edited: 9:11 am, March 10, 2020 "

Hey let us know if you were able to go through it

"@ L0neGr00ver, I've just read your post regarding suspension of visa waivers:""But if you’re travelling independently and haven’t got a visa yet then you have a problem""We are (theoretically) flying to Vietnam next month independently and don't have visas because we were relying on the waiver. As far as you understand it, does this mean we will not be allowed entry at all if the suspension comes into force?Thanks, B."
> if the suspension comes into force?It comes into force 00:00 12/03/20.Your choices are :the embassy - not issuing visas unless you can get a letter from your sponsor/tour company( vietnamembassy.org.uk/index.php… )an E-Visa - they say: Temporarily stop issuing e-Visa for foreigners who are in or have recently visited areas where Covid-19 is spreading( …xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt ) A pre-approved visa letter from the likes of VietnamVisaPro.net who are apparently turning away UK passport holders at least.That's your problem.
"We applied for my gf’s visa on arrival letter on Monday. 2 working day service. I applied later on Monday using the 1 day service. On Tuesday morning I was told mine was declined. This morning my girlfriends was sent to us approved. I suspect hers was actually approved on Monday, but Vietnam Visa Pro delayed in sending it to us, probably because they had to send it to some of the 20 Chinese people on it first. I think visa on arrival letters are now a no go unless your tour operator arranged it. I’m concerned about us getting in though. I have an e-visa, my girlfriend has a VoA letter. In theory no reason why we can’t go, but I’m nervous and will need to decide tomorrow whether to cut our losses and go elsewhere."
I have applied for Visa approval letters which I hope we can get to then enable us to get visa via the embassy (all before next Wednesday).I called the travel insurance and they advise that getting the correct documents to travel is down to us and not part of the policy cover however due to the ever changing situation they would be willing to look at it if we didn’t get visas sorted in time for any reason. Holiday nightmares
"@Barbara from what I was told this morning at the embassy no-one from the affected countries will be allowed in without a visa, so no entry at all under the visa waiver scheme. And no new visas will be issued except through tour agencies who can vouch they will manage any care needed in case you get sick. It wasn't clear exactly how the visas through tour agencies would work, but if you're on a tour the message saw to contact the agency. If like us you're travelling independently, then unless you have a visa (including e-visas), then you won't be allowed in. Most of the people at the embassy seemed to be in this position and weren't very happy - lots of discussion about how to claim back from insurance companies :(Having said that it all seemed very fluid, the poor embassy staff were trying to do their best but had obviously been caught out by this too. So hopefully things might ease up, or if not maybe you could find a tour agency that would help."
Thanks Richard I am hoping if we can prove we have done everything we can to get visas for our trip that insurance will pay up if it’s not possible to go. Like you say the best few days will release gods knows what else so we will have to see what happens.
"Had email conversation with uk embassy yesterday, after several questions the answers collected together come to this. If you have a visa in place be that e-visa or another type then you will be allowed in, IF you meet any medical screening that may apply to you or your departure point. As of today no visas will be issued by the embassy as NEW applications unless there is a good reason, no E-visas will be processed, but no actual date of application acceptance, so if applied for a couple of days ago may be ok.I would suspect the flight from LGW was pulled would be all on it would only be going for say 14 nights so did not need a visa when booking.Hoping to go on 28th for F1 but as we will fly out of Paris that could well be a problem !!!Good luck all."
"This was from the British Embassy in Hanoi? Speaking to a British, native English speaker?"
What contact email address did you use to special to them please? I have questions to ask also.Thanks
We too are going to Hanoi via Paris but on 27th March. I was leaving the visa application until nearer the time so now think I have problems getting one at all. I was sending my husband to the Embassy with forms tomorrow but realise it is pointless as we have booked the whole trip independently (as many others have ) We have booked Vietnam airlines so hope they may allow changes if a visa is not available. Feeling sad as meeting up with daughter from Australia to holiday in Vietnam.
"> I would suspect the flight from LGW was pulledWell, it left. But I suspect it's empty so it can bring people back. https://uk.flightaware.com/live/flight/TOM64"
My holiday has officially cancelled as Vietnam airlines will not let me board tomorrow without a visa.
this was the uk vietnam embassy in london. the contact email address is on there web site.
Thank you I emailed them yesterday but no reply was hoping it might have been elsewhere.Adem is this covered by insurance company?
"Will you get a refund?I think I will be in the same boat, I'm due to fly on Saturday"
We are travelling independently for 11 days but within that there is a 3 day cruise of Halong Bay. I was thinking of asking the agency we booked the cruise with if they can help with the visa despite the cruise only making a portion of our visit. Has anyone else tried this at all?
Are you getting a refund from Vietnam Airlines? Our travel insurance won't cover us. Our only hope is either getting a visa approval letter through our cruise operator (also a tour agency). We booked flights independently so unless the airline cancels the flight or tells us we can't board we will be penalised.
"We are also due to fly out on Saturday via Qatar, but we are struggling to get a final answer from anyone on whether or not we should travel.We were planning on using the waiver program, applied for a visa via VietnamVisaPro.com last night when we found out about the suspension, but they emailed to say they aren't issuing letters to UK citizens.The travel agent we booked the flights through (TravelUp) are not being very helpful at all, and no-one seems to want to take responsibility of telling us what we should do.Completely at a loss for what to do next, so any suggestions welcome!"
Does anyone know if you need a visa to transit through Hanoi (or any of the airports) onto somewhere else?Will Vietnam airlines let you board (visaless) if you show you are transferring and not going landside in Vietnam? Trying to think of options????
"> Will Vietnam airlines let you board (visaless) if you show you are transferring and not going landside in Vietnam? Trying to think of options????Transit without a visa is /possible/ in Hanoi.However, it depends on the airlines involved. Will your bags be checked through (because if you need to collect them and recheck, that's after immigration)?Will the airline allow you to fly to Hanoi WITHOUT a visa if you're planning to transit to another airline on a separate booking?It's a possibility. No more than that. Maybe speak to Vietnam Airlines and try to get a new booking for a round trip from Hanoi added to your current booking...."
So looks like the TUI flight from earlier today eventually did end up flying (albeit almost 2 hours late?)https:/…VVPQhttps:/…64Would be interesting to see reports from anyone on that flight tomorrow.
"@ThisPlus87I think it flew empty to bring people back.TUI have today told me ""... we have had no alternative but to cancel TOM064 London Gatwick to Phu Quoc today ..."""
"Ben,You should apply a visa from the embassy. Ask them if they can do it before your departure."
"> Ben,> You should apply a visa from the embassy.I think he knows that. The problem is how to get a letter from a Vietnamese tour company which would allow that."
Myself and my partner have our VOA already and are travelling next month... We are travelling independently. Is this enough to be granted Visas when we arrive? I am getting increasingly confused by all of the new rules. Thanks Guys!
"Ben e. Qatar have wavered some of there booking conditions, it’s on there website. We are due out with them on28th. I called them today, expect the call to drop out, it did many times, if you get in the Q then just hold on. You can cancel your flight within 3 days of dept and get a voucher to the value of your booking valid for 12 months from date of booking. Amend your dates with no fee, or your destination with no fee, but if there is a fare difference for the latter you pay the extra. Hope this may assist."
"> ManatdollarYou're correct, we're also flying independent of a tour operator, as we booked our flights through TravelUp and our accomodation through Airbnb. The embassy weren't much help this morning, nor are any of the other companies involved.Not looking good for us at the moment."
"> Is this enough to be granted Visas when we arrive?Used to be. perfectly fine. By next month, or even tomorrow? Nobody knows.Check nearer the time."
"> elansearThanks for the info. We didn't book directly with Qatar though unfortunately though, so doubt this will apply to us"
Ben look at the website think it mentions if booked through an agent get them to contact Qatar

"Hi,We're in a similar situation. Booked through Travelup in January with British Airways operated by Qatar via Doha on 1 April. We have delibrately. delayed booking accommodation as we thought situation would develop rapidly.Doubtful about getting money back. Emailed Travelup a couple of days ago before the Visa news came through. Also tried to call last week and were on hold for 2.5 hours, got to front of queue and the call cut out.Please keep us posted on anything you hear."
"posted by someone else who had the email from the embassy just:Beause of covid19 outbreak in some countries in Europe, the Embassy of Vietnam in London for the time being will not accept requests for visa processing until further notice. Only applicants with visa approval letter from the Immigration Department of Vietnam can apply for visa issuance from the Embassy. Due to the change of circumstances, the Embassy of Vietnam in London could not process visa application submitted in the 9th of March and will make full refund for the applicants by post.For those who wish to travel to Vietnam, they need to contact with their Vietnamese sponsors/tour-operators for arrangement of their visas with the Immigration Department of Vietnam.

"Fortunately for us are tour company our in the process of getting us visa approval letters.Edited: 2:32 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"We actually had a flight booked with Cathay via Hong Kong with TravelUp, one of the flights got changed and they refunded the money to us.Hoping they will confirm a refund here, otherwise surely will be covered by travel/credit card insurance as we want to go but it's not possible and totally out of our control."
I can cancel some parts of mine and re use other bits rest will end up with travel insurance pretty sure CC companies have no liability on this one
"HI, we are travelling to Hanoi on Qatar on the 20th. we are going for 18 days and thus have already applied and got our E visa valid for 30 days. Any one had any issues with visas already issued once there? We got our E visa;s last week only 24 hours to process. thanks"
"- My Swedish friend went to the embassy in Stockholm today and they accept the application without the need for LoA or anything. They promised the visa would be ready next Monday. Maybe the situation in the UK is more severe. - I got the info from Finnair via email as follow: ""On March 10, 2020, the Vietnamese authorities confirmed that many EU citizens no longer enjoy visa-free travel to Vietnam. This decision affects passengers on your Finnair flight AY161, which departs from Helsinki on Wednesday, March 11, and arrives at Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) on March 12, at 7:55. Please note, that if you do not have a visa, Finnair cannot transport you to Ho Chi Minh City. Finnair will refund your ticket. When traveling to Vietnam on other departure dates, make sure you have a valid visa. To obtain one, please contact the Vietnamese embassy nearest to you.""So, basically they will refund my ticket if I wanna cancel, or change to later dates. But apparently I must have a visa to board. No mention if VOA and e-visa work or not.I know most of you are in the UK and our situations are probably different but I just wanna share our stories here."
manatdollar The problem is how to get a letter from a Vietnamese tour company which would allow that.----------Probably the reason for specifying a tour operator is in case you go ill. Presumably the tour operators are expected to cover their clients against such things. And unfortunately I think it will get worse before it gets better. We've put off our trip to July / August now even though I have a 5yr exemption visa. Just not worth the risk or the hassle.
Who did you book with? Direct with an airline or a booking agent?
> manatdollar The problem is how to get a letter from a Vietnamese tour company which would allow that.I *know* that. I'm not sure what you are replying to.

"I’m in the process of trying to cancel my holiday now, but know someone on Phu Quoc currently who isn’t allowed to fly back to the U.K. they are making them stay on the island!!"
"Would anyone have the official website of the Vietnam Immigration Department? I am struggling to find it. I need proof that visas are no longer issued so I can fight this with our travel insurance who are refusing to cover us. The London Vietnam Embassy's website is not clear enough. Also fighting with BA and Qatar Airways (we booked Qatar through BA). At the moment we are losing our flights. I am waiting to hear back from Vietnam Airlines regarding our domestic flights but looking at their website it seems they may be more flexible. Our cruise, hotels and sightseeing tours can be cancelled."
"> Would anyone have the official website of the Vietnam Immigration Department?https://immigration.gov.vn/There's nothing there.

I haven't seen anything in Vietnamese anywhere either.You could apply for an E-Visa and if they email to say no-can-do, maybe use that."
Hi I did a chat with them last night and same advised no visas for 8 eu countries and to contact the embassy
"Hi allEveryone seems to be in the same-ish predicament and I can only share your frustration and anxiety. I have international and domestic flights booked for Sunday to Hanoi from Heathrow. I understand the arguments about visa, possible quarantine and possible issues losing accommodation etc but wondered whether anyone had been able to argue successfully with vietnam airlines to cancel and get a refund. I do have an evisa so technically I am ok to go as not part of the visa waiver debacle...again my best wishes and good luck to you all."
Did you go on your tours.
"Vietnam airlines have said that we can cancel, but we have to pay the normal fee. Nothing better than that yet.."
Hi all just an update (from my travel insurance I just spoke to) about cover for this whole Visa debacle...We aren’t covered as it.. and I quote “is possible to get a visa in time for your trip (April) with a letter requested from the tour operator” As we booked everything independent we don’t have a tour operator... I mentioned this and all they said was to try and find a tour operator and ask them if we book a trip or 2 can the apply for this approval letter which would then let us apply for the visa. So basically no trip to Vietnam for us. Luckily the only money we have lost and can’t claim is 3 internal flights.
"I’m not an insurance lawyer, but that sounds odd to me from the insurance company. But the insurance companies won’t give helpful advice up front - they’ll wait for claims to come in and then take a look. Unfortunately that’s just how they work - super unhelpful. This whole issue is quite novel, and insurance T&Cs are cut out for it, certainly not for countries in Vietnam where the custom is to get a visa on arrival..."
"I think the whole visa situation in this case is just too new for the insurance companies. I’m not cancelling the flights I can’t use just yet, if things change with the visa it might help with the insurance claim a few weeks down the line. AirAsia have said they won’t refund the Hanoi to Bangkok flight, just waiting to hear back from Vietnam Airlines on theirs."
FWIW our e-visa was accepted by Vietnam Airlines for our flight this morning (they did check them very thoroughly though) and we’re now waiting to board. Although the flight was pretty full the check-in staff were expecting to turn away about half of the ticket holders though and we saw a few folks getting turned back :(
Turned back because their VISA's were not in order?
The embassy website has been updated just now: http://vietnamembassy.org.uk/No mention of visa restrictions!
Sorry ignore me. I was on the wrong page. It's for Irish nationals.
"Think everyone is exaggerating the situation, immigration, travel agents, airlines and people themselves. Blanket bans on entire population is unwarranted and uncalled for. This deprives Vietnam from tourist dollars not going to help the country anyway.If immigration finds anyone poses a risk, they could quarantine or turn them away, instead of doing a blanket ban on everyone from a particular region."
"> exaggerating the situation, immigration, travel agents, airlines and people themselves.Well, Vietnam did a stunning job of containing the virus until it started being brought in by people coming from abroad where it hadn't been contained.Their country. Their rules. Vietnam had no new cases for 3 weeks prior to patient #17 who brought it back after travel to Italy, France, UK.UK is doubling every three days at the moment. > If immigration finds anyone poses a risk, they could quarantineThat doesn't help if the symptoms don't appear until after they're wandering around Vietnam.> This deprives Vietnam from tourist dollars not going to help the country anyway.That's not the way Vietnam sees it. Their tourist business is paying a heavy price, but the government has put public safety above that."
"I totally agree that Vietnam should look after the population first. I am a tourist who is desperate to see this amazing country. It's my bucket list 50th birthday present. The problem is not with Vietnam...it's the authorities who continue to drop feed only ambiguous information. When that happens distrust and misinformation spoons follows. The biggest challenge is deciding what is true, false, biased, exaggerated etc. I am still holding out hope I can go Sunday. I think some clear instruction from the airlines and FCO would help decision making"
"""I think some clear instruction from the airlines...""I think with the way it's evolved so quickly, with very much movable goalposts, the airlines, like everyone else, just can't keep up.I'm impressed with what Vietnam is trying achieve, but l think the visa communication could certainly be better.And needs to be.Scott"
"> I think some clear instruction from the airlines and FCO would help decision making.I don't think they have clear information either. :-(But it would only take some one in Vietnam 5 minutes to put something on the front page of immigration.gov.vnPart of the problem is the division of responsibilities within the Vietnamese Government. But that's still no excuse for the woeful communication. And the embassies have never been a reliable source of information anyway, so we're stuck with the current mess. After 22 years I decided to go somewhere other than Vietnam this year. Can't go there either, but at least I don't have to navigate the current visa mess."
"HI, can you update when you land, Did you get through with your e visa? Silly question did you print in black and white or colour? Don't want anything to hamper travel. Thanks"
For anyone like me who doesn’t have a tour operator and went independent.... I’ve just heard from a tour operator who I contacted to try book with to try and get the approval letter and they replied saying that Vietnam are currently not issuing any approval letters either... I guess this is just a case for any new bookings though and existing booking should get the letters ok. This was from Inside Asia Tours.
"""Silly question did you print in black and white or colour?""Black and white is fine.Scott"
"Hi - Just found this interesting thread about e-visas . We are due to go to Vietnam early April, then on to Cambodia and Laos on an escorted tour package. However, we are very concerned about being put in quarantine when we arrive following the reports on the Brits who flew from Heathrow to Hanoi on 2nd March and sat with a Vietnamese lady who had the virus, The video of the ""hospital"" was a real worry. Has anyone had any experience of medical care in Vietnam - is it really that bad?"
thanks Scott
Has anyone had any experience of medical care in Vietnam - is it really that bad?===========================================Its not uncommon. Nurses dont usually wash or feed patients. Misdiagnosis is common. Infections in wounds is a problemIt varies greatly from hospital to hospital and it depends on how much you want to pay
Through whom did you apply for approval letter?
"on Vietnam UK Embassy website:From 0:00 am (Vietnamese time) the 12 of March, Vietnam temporarily stops the 15-day visa exemption for people holding British normal passports. Nationals of the UK must have valid visa in order to enter Vietnam.Beause of covid -19 outbreak in some countries in Europe, the Embassy of Vietnam in London for the time being will not accept requests for visa processing until further notice. Only applicants with visa approval letter from the Immigration Department of Vietnam can apply for visa issuance from the Embassy.For those who wish to travel to Vietnam, they need to contact with their Vietnamese sponsors/tour-operators for arrangement of their visas with the Immigration Department of Vietnam. Once they get the visa approval letter from the Immigration Department, they can contact Vietnam Embassy for the issuance of their visas"
"FCO has just updated their site:VISASAs of 11 March 2020, there is increased disruption and restrictions on British nationals visiting Vietnam. British travellers to Vietnam report uncertainty about the impact of these new restrictions even for those with valid visas.We understand that the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security has stopped processing e-visa applications for people coming from or in transit through coronavirus hit areas. This is in addition to the suspension of Vietnam’s visa waiver programme for UK citizensfrom 12 March 2020. Anyone travelling ahead of that time should check with their airline in advance as a precaution.The Vietnamese Embassy in London will cease processing visa applications with effect of 12 March 2020 until further notice. There is uncertainty around the replacement process and timeline for such applications. Anyone planning to travel to Vietnam is advised to get a visa before booking flights.British citizens arriving in Vietnam will be required to fill in a health questionnaire and undertake basic health tests on arrival. False declarations regarding health history could lead to prosecution.If you have questions about entry requirements for your specific itinerary, you should contact the Vietnamese Embassy in London or, if already in Vietnam, the nearest Immigration Office.From November 2015, British nationals who are spouses or children of Vietnamese nationals can apply for a visa exemption certificate. The certificate is valid for 5 years and allows multiple entries into Vietnam for 6 month periods. Applications can be made at the nearest Vietnamese Embassy or the Immigration Department in Vietnam.Overstaying your Vietnamese visa without authority is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid. Check the visa validity and conditions carefully.For further information about visa requirements, check with the Vietnamese Embassy in London."
"We travel to Vietnam in August. Will these restrictions still be in place then? If so, it will devastate their tourism economy. The health of their own citizens is of course and should be the priority."
"FCO really clearing things up:""The Vietnamese Embassy in London will cease processing visa applications with effect of 12 March 2020 until further notice. There is uncertainty around the replacement process and timeline for such applications. Anyone planning to travel to Vietnam is advised to get a visa before booking flights.""So if the Vietnamese Embassy in London will cease processing visa applications, how on Earth can they advise us to get a visa before travelling? Where are we meant to get the visa from?Edited: 11:37 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Has anyone successfully managed to make an insurance claim yet due to the visa situation? My insurers are getting back to me as said the underwriters are looking into the case, but my boyfriends insurers flat out said no. I’ve since spoken to AMEX as made a number of my bookings via credit card and they have said their insurance team (where you have insurance with them) were saying no initially but are now looking into claims as essentially this is a foreign government saying do not travel, which is essentially the same as our government saying do not travel. Not sure if that makes a case in itself but interested to hear how other people are getting on going down this route?Edited: 11:44 am, March 11, 2020 "
"> So if the Vietnamese Embassy in London will cease processing visa applications, how on Earth can they advise us to get a visa before travelling? Where are we meant to get the visa from?That's not quite true. They will process visa applications:vietnamembassy.org.uk/index.php…> For those who wish to travel to Vietnam, they need to contact with their Vietnamese sponsors/tour-operators for arrangement of their visas with the Immigration Department of Vietnam. Once they get the visa approval letter from the Immigration Department, they can contact Vietnam Embassy for the issuance of their visas."
So if you are travelling independently you are stuffed ?
hi what if you got an e visa from vietnam immigration department
"> So if you are travelling independently you are stuffedCurrently, yes, you are out of luck, according to the London Consulate. Given that the Vietnamese had no new cases for 3 weeks until they re-imported it from Italy/UK and UK cases are doubling every three days, I expect things are not going to get any easier."
"Too right manat. It wouldn't surprise me that even if you get to Vietnam, if you came from the UK you'd go into quarantine. What a great way to have a holiday. I know it must be costing some people money (lots) but I really don't blame the Vietnamese (or any other country for that matter) for clamping down on who they let in. Time to get real people. Things are going to get worse before they get better. Normal service is not an option. Seems its been declared a pandemic now by WHO. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51839944Edited: 1:47 pm, March 11, 2020 "
You will be quarantined for sure by the looks of it https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-pr…
"Would be good to see the quarantine decision from an official source rather than the press, a token google reveals nothing official (yet)"
"Anyone have any idea about transfers? I'm off to Bali (hopefully) on Tuesday via Ho Chí Minh... I've been asking the folk at Vietnam Air but I hope they're a little lost in. translation...They're saying no visas are being issued, so no entry... I'm thinking I'm airside, so international space, so shouldn't count. Clutching I know. Sad times."

"We applied for a visa on arrival 2 days ago fearing that Vietnam were going to stop the visa waiver system. We opted for the 4 working hours turnaround just to make sure but were advised at 1am this morning that 'Vietnam Immigration Department has informed this morning that they will temporarily stop to process visa for UK citizen'. We still went to the airport as we were due to fly at 11am this morning and the new visa rule doesn't come into force until tomorrow but as we were due to land tomorrow morning we were told we couldn't go without a visa. As we were part of a tour group with Mercury Holidays (who have been useless and said, when asked about the visa situation, that they are not trained on visa advice although their booking confirmation advised we did not need a visa...) we assume there were many others in the same situation. Mercury, ABTA, travel insurance and credit card companies have all told us we are not due a refund as the holiday wasn't cancelled so we may have lost £5,000Felt sorry for a couple who had flown from Scotland and weren't aware of the visa situation and were pretty shocked when they tried to check in at Heathrow."
We are in Cambodia and 2 days ago we went to get a Visa for our 10 day stay in Vietnam. Refused because we are from the UK. So our Travel Counsellor has got us on a flight home today. The travel insurance company don't agree it's a curtailment so are playing up. We want to go to Vietnam but are not allowed to. The FCO should act. Trying to be positive after all who wants to go to a country where they are not wanted. Maybe another time it will be different.
"This is not directly related, but parallel.President Trump just announced a ban on travel from Europe (except the UK) to the US for the next 30 days.This might influence the decision of other government.Really not a good time to travel, IMHO.John"
">>President Trump just announced a ban on travel from Europe (except the UK) to the US for the next 30 days.<<This one is actually a sensible one IMO, apart from leaving the UK out (clearly a political ploy):https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homeland…If Vietnam would only do it in a similar way rather than a paint the citizens all with the same brush approach. I've not been in Europe for over a year but can't get to Vietnam because of my UK passport..."
The good news: We made it into Vietnam on our eVisa. So this is definitely still working. The bad news: Someone on our flight developed a fever and now the everyone on the plane has been shipped to a quarantine centre praying she tests negative for covid-19. Otherwise we’re here for 2 weeks.
Just shows what a lottery it is getting in. Good luck and hope you are not stuck in quarantine for 14 days.
Passengers from other flights were being allowed in as usual. We were just unlucky having someone in our flight develop symptoms.
"We have just cancelled with heavy hearts. Personally the position has become too fluid and too many moving parts and uncertainties. There does appear to be a certain direction of travel here which i was unable to ignore.For those who travel to Vietnam I wish you the most fantastic time and good luck.Gutting as it is, the cloud of travel bans, restrictions and closures weighed heavy. I wish there was more clarity from the FCO, travel providers, insurers and interested parties. A line in the sand needs to be drawn so that Vietnam,it's people, and tourists can make informed decisions."

"British travel advice and Vietnam embassy now saying two different things:""We understand that the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security has stopped processing e-visa applications for people coming from or in transit through coronavirus hit areas. This is in addition to the suspension of Vietnam’s visa waiver programme for UK citizensfrom 12 March 2020. Anyone travelling ahead of that time should check with their airline in advance as a precaution.The Vietnamese Embassy in London will cease processing visa applications with effect of 12 March 2020 until further notice""No mention of this on the Vietnam embassy site?"
"> No mention of this on the Vietnam embassy site?E-Visas are nothing to do with the embassy. Same with pre-approved visa letters, nothing to do with them (unless you get one where the pickup point is specified as the embassy, which is far from the general case of what most travellers do).But what is missing is a clear and kept-up-to-date statement on an official Vietnamese Government site saying just what the rules are. Embassies in Laos, Cambodia are still apparently doing visas for UK citizens, so it depends a little where you are as well as as what passport you have."
Look at this site:visatovietnam.com/info-for-travellers-on-cov…
"EVisas do still work if you have one. The embassy confirmed this to me in person on Tuesday and We entered Vietnam with ours this morning along with a number of other folks. However I don’t believe any new ones are being granted, so unless you already have one it’s not much helpPS And we’ve just been released from quarantine, so heading back to HCMC for a large beer!"
"""PS And we’ve just been released from quarantine, so heading back to HCMC for a large beer!""Great news!But l wouldn't be stopping at one. ;-)Scott"
"""But l wouldn't be stopping at one. ;-)"".............................................................I bet it's just a figure of speech. :))"
Our bad luck for not getting an evisa when we didn't need one for a 12 day stay. Off to Phnom Penh airport for flight back to Uk. Have a beer for me and enjoy Vietnam!!
Once you have been in HCMC for a few hours it would be really useful; to get your feedback on your experiences - I am due to fly out next week and still not sure whether to cancel or not
@Richard S. This must've been your flight:https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/passengers…
"#246 (@Richard S) - I am curious... in your situation, did they let you have access to your checked luggage when you are at the quarantine centre or were you without your belongs?"
"@ks8882015, thanks for your post. Regarding: - ""We understand that the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security has stopped processing e-visa applications for people coming from or in transit through coronavirus hit areas.

It could be useful for our insurance claim as we are cancelling our trip planned for April. Thanks, B."
Barbara - read the foreign office website site all information there
"@barbara, this might help:https:/…entry-requirementsVietnam has announced that from noon Vietnam time (0500 UK) on 15 March 2020 foreign nationals will be refused entry to Vietnam if in the previous 14 days they have been to the UK, or any Schengen country, even in transit. This restriction will be in place for 30 days.So, entry impossible for 30 days starting from 15th March. And there's obviously the risk if it being extended, but if you're meant to be arriving in the first half of April, you'd be denied entry."
"Yup, read that 20 times already... But I'm not entering the country. I'm not passing immigration.... I'm not entering Vietnam the country, I'm airside on international land."
> But I'm not entering the country. I'm not passing immigrationCheck with your airline if they will let you fly.> I'm airside on international land.It's still Vietnamese land :-)
The gov.uk site says “even in transit” If that helps? Well clears it up rather then helps.
Scratch that. I think they mean transit through the U.K. etc... my mistakes sorry.
"> I think they mean transit through the U.K. etcYes. But your problem in these strange times is trying to persuade an airline to take you to Hanoi. IATA/Timaticweb is hopeless out of date since all these changes started, so even the airline may have no way of knowing if they can carry you or not.I'd ask your airline."
Please note that the FCO advice has now changed: The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the whole country.
