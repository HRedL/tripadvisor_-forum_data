I am touring a game park in Nairobi and embarking on the Aegean Argossy out of Mombassa. What are the safety and health risks in light of the ebola epidemic?
"Kenya Airways have suspended all their flights to and from Sierra Leone and Liberia. The Kenyan government has also announced other restrictions, saying it is temporarily suspending entry into Kenya of passengers who have passed through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. If there are no direct flights and there are two and a half thousands miles and several other countries between Nairobi and the nearest cases which are in Lagos, Nigeria surely the risk is not high. To put people's panic about ebola into context, there has never been a single case in Kenya, but in the last year that figures have been published over 26,000 people in Kenya died of malaria, what are the odds?"
I am currently in Ukunda on holiday. Ebola is totally irrelevant here. It is really not an issue. Hope this helps
just as a matter of interest has has there ever been an outbreak of septecemia in Kenya? Just from my point of view!!Thanks.
I thought septicaemia was a bacterial infection rather than viral. Why do you ask?
"A long tale. I caught it in Kenya when out on my own and admitted to hospital when I returned home and was in hospital for 8 weeks and nearly died. Hubby was told by consultant that I was in right place, right treatment bur no guarantees. I was out of it for 3 weeks in ICU and I believe I caught it by a scrape on my leg. Will PM you. Too much to tell here.Edited: 5 years ago "
Ouch...........another one to add to the risk assessment!
"Septicemia or sepsis is what is commonly called blood poisoning and can be contracted as a result of an infection anywhere in the world, in fact there are around 100,000 cases every year in the UK. It's not something that's specifically related to KenyaMore info herenhs.uk/conditions/…Introduction.aspx"
"Thankfully I had an accident three days before leaving Kenya and fractured and dislocated my shoulder and not on arrival.I tripped over a case strap which had fallen down after coming back from safari and went all my length on the tiling on the floor.I knew something was not right with my shoulder and phoned the duty manager.He told me to rest and would make arrangements for me to go to to Diani Hospital the next day.A wrong diagnosis was given and told only muscle damage- at that point I did not know my shoulder was fractured and dislocated There was also a small ulcer on my leg where I had scraped on the marble tiling - I went flat out and I believe as from a doctor that I caught strettoccus in that part of the leg.The staff were so kind packing my clothes and helping me dress but the journey back which took 24 hours was pure pain.I went to my doctor on return but they did not seem to be too bothered about my leg and sent me to A & E who put the shoulder back in and gave me a sling although the fracture was still there.However all kicked off that evening with myself being very ill and I do not recall being taken into a blue flashing ambulance and into ICU - I have to ask my husband all this as there were tubes all over me - my kidneys packed in and on dialysis being heavily sedated on antibiotics, blood transfusions etc..I am not going into all that happened but now I am very careful if I cut myself or when doing gardening that a rose thorn does not go into my hand if I get scraped with anything.I was one of the lucky people but I know that my body or arm which I still do not have the full use of is not what it was.It happens all over the world and as Doffcocker has pointed out but it would happen to myself on my own when in Kenya.As my husband has said I was lucky to get home as the treatment at The Royal Infirmary was second to none.Just be careful if you cut yourself on holiday:)"
"While I can't advise whether treatment for Sepsis and/or Tetanus are similar, at least remember to get a Tetanus jab before leaving home. Can be helpful if accident where skin is broken (even if at home). Discuss with your personal doctor."
Tetanus and septeciamia are completely different. You can get a jab for tetatunus but not for septis.I went through it and was lucky as well not to loose a limb.I would not wish it on anyone.We always keep up to date with our jabs for tetanus etc since we went out in 1995. I believe the tetanus lasts for 10 years. Believe me I would get a jab for septis if there was one.Tetanus is totally different form septis.Edited: 5 years ago 
Thanks for clarifying. Appreciate learning something new about anything.
4sandi. Thanks. I did not know the risks of septis until I got it and hopefully never again!!As I have said to many people I am always careful now if I scratch or tear a bit of skin off my leg.It is only when you have it and go through it that only that person knows what it is like!!
I just saw this. Any validity to it?…xinhuanet.com/english/…c_133710705.htm
"Why is the article only available on the English language version of the Chinese Press? If were true, then it would be available on many web sites."
Kind if what I was wondering... Couldn't find anything else to verify.
