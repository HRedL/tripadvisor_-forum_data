"Hello. Thank your for your effort in advance.I totally understand you guys have a hard time. But you should have had a protocol system for an urgent situation. One of my flight is within 72hours, but I have no idea how to contact with travelgenio for cancellation.Actually, I made two reservations with travlejenio but I request for cancellation two of them because of COVID-19. I would really appreciate if you could help me.1.reservation code: 17902441reservation number: ozzw8k2.reservation code: 17888964reservation number: KL8KJPI want to make sure that I can get a full refund. Please check my status and let me know what should I do. Additionally, I got a silver service grade preparing for cancellation and full refund.Thank you"
"Travelgenio is based in Spain, which probably means that their staff are in lockdown and their capacity to deal with anything right now is severely limited. It's all very well demanding they have ""protocols in place for an urgent situation"", but this is beyond urgent, it is totally unprecedented.You will just have to wait, and hope you get your money back eventually."
"Per Travelgenio's terms and conditions, they will refund 85% of the ticket price when processing a cancellation action. How long that will take given current circumstances is anyone's guess.In times like this, I always think of Howard Beale whose words of wisdom were 'go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, 'I'm mad as hell, and I'm not taking this anymore!'Edited: 11:07 am, April 02, 2020 "

Hello Carrot. One of our agents will contact you shortly. Best regards.INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"CARROT, I don't think anyone predicted or prepared for this situation. I would never expect a bargain basement outfit working on very thin margins to have much in the way of a business continuity plan anyway.You do seem to meet the criteria to be contacted, so it could be worse."
"Cancellation & full refundHello,I've booked a flight from Korea to the United States on January 24th (Aiana Airlines).But we have to cancel it because of the coronavirus.I tried to contact you through the website, mail, and Twitter, and the customer service sent me an answer.It was about requesting a copy of the passport for cancellation request from Asiana and I replied to the email, but there was no reply.It has been 10 days since I sent the passport photo.I received a full refund from Asiana Airlines first.Please cancel the flight ticket and give me a full refund.reservation code: 17347446reservation number: OBTQWQ"

"Do read the Travelgenio threads. Spain is in lockdown, and there are not many Travelgenio staff working."
"I doubt you'll be contacted very soon, hil, unless you are due to travel imminently."
i am also having some very serious issues trying to contact travelgenio. i booked a flight with them on April 13th which was cancelled due to covid 19 and they do not respond to emails and their telephone number is not working. Anyone have any advice on how to make contact?
Andre: Please read the thread before you post.
"Sydney is right. Read this thread and the ONE HUNDRED other threads about this company. You picked a terrible company to use, maybe to save a little money? But they have been a bad company for many many years with awful customer service.Keep your expectations low. Tell your friends not to use this company."

"I am F***** LIVID with this site, after traveling to Europe for yearssss I have never encountered this BS. I have waisted over 42 hours of my life sitting on the phone over and over just to get hung up on by this company. I cant get into ""my trips"" it says I didn't have a reservation W T F! I want someone to get in touch with me as soon as possible."
Travelgenio DIGRACE. No contact contact. Can't get into My Trips. No email to contact. No phone number. NO CONTACT FORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a scam!
"I've been trying to contact this site for 3 bookings for 2 months, again I have been on the phon waiting for 60 minutes all to get hung up on! What kind of F**** company is this????????? I can sue for this type of service."
Smith: Please read the thread before you post. Nobody is getting any kind of service from Travelgenio. There are hundreds of threads and many thousands of warnings about this dreadful company. Why did you not do any research before you threw money at some random web site?
"smith, Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"Smith: we have over 20,000 posts here warning you away over many YEARS.You chose to lie down with feral dogs, the fleas come with them."
