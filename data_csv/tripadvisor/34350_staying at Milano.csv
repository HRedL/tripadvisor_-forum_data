We have flight tickets to Milano for the end of March sould I cancel them because the coronavirus? What about La Scala performences?
Nobody can possibly know what the situation will be by the end of March.
"I believe no. We recently travel to Munich, where the first incidents in Europe observed. We fear a lot but we take our measures. We didn't touch our face without wash our hands. Before eating or after toilet we wash our hand. In metro, buses, train we take some masks just in case (we never use them) but we use liquids or wipes like dettol. Don't panic we didn't face the thread that TV shows to us before the trip. We use every day trains and got to places like Neuschwanstein castle and Hallstat (very popular to Chinese tourists). The main principle is to avoid touch your face (nose, eyes etc) with your hand."
Also keep in mind late March the most of the areas due to the increase temperatures will have open windows so fresh air will decrease the ability of viruses to spread
Thankn you for your positive answers
"well and truly said, media tries to hype issues."
"Also see other forum thread this week entitled ""La Scala shut for coronavirus?"" [ https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18784… ]."
“... the increase temperatures will have open windows so fresh air will decrease the ability of viruses to spread”Wow where did this come from? Don’t spread misinformation. There is no evidence for your dangerous comments.
The latest travel advisory from thd US CDChttps:/…index.htmlFrom the WHOhttps://www.who.int/
"It would be wise not to visit Milan ""for the end of March"" due to all the ""red zone"" restrictions for Lombardy and Milan (presently up to April 3, but also possibly could well be extended beyond that date). Look for information updates not in this thread, but on the ""sticky"" forum threads at the top of the Italy Forum and in news sources."
