We are planning to take a bus from Hue to Hoi An. Is it good idea to stop at Marble mountain (I am just thinking to save time and money and not going back from Hoi An to Marble mountain)?Or it's better to take a straight trip bus from Hoi An next day. We are not going to have a car.Thank you in advance!!!
"If you have time to see it on the way, then by all means do that.But in my opinion, there are better things to see / do in the area than Marble Mountain.More time stopping along the Hai Van Pass to take in the view, and having a look at the Lady Buddha on Son Tra Peninsula, being two of them.Scott"
"Thank you Scott for your response!I am not sure if we can do more stops. I thought to take a bus from Hue to Hoi An. In order to do more stops, probably we need to take a private car. May be to add one more day to our itinerary (4 nights in Hoi An) and do half a day trip to Marble Mountain. What do you think?"
"""What do you think?""You need to do / see what's important to you, taking into account the amount of time you have.""In order to do more stops, probably we need to take a private car.""Doing that, if money and time permits, would be my preference.And perhaps even better, would be doing it on the back of a motorbike.Here's a little about what we did as a day trip from Hoi An in 2017.You could easily fit all that in going from Hue to Hoi An.https:/…Having said all that, the weather may play a part.When is this planned for?Scott"
"We planned end of December 2020, begin of January 2021, but because of Covid-19 we postponed until 2021-2022 same months."
"Okay, it's at the end, or just after, the wet season, so might still be a bit cloudy / drizzly, which could impact the views.Maybe play it by ear, or sight, when you're there.ScottEdited: 4:58 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"Thank you so much for all responses.Regarding the travel time I read that end of December and January is the most dry season in Vietnam. We are planning to cover all part (north, center and south). Do you think I need to choose different time?"
"Hello,You can study Vietnam's weather in better detail on the Weather Spark website.https://weatherspark.com/y/119966/Average-We…Basically :Dec / Jan is a fine time to visit the South, but it is towards the end of the rainy season in Da Nang / Hoi An, so you could experience some rain there. Its dry season in the north, so the greater Ha Noi area should be okay. In the far north, Sa Pa and beyond, it is the start of winter and is often cold and very foggy.Take care :)"
"Hi Michael, Thank you for your recommendation! It's very difficult to choose time, because we are planning to start from Hahoi -> Halong Bay -> Hue-> Hoi An->Ho Chi Minh. Sa Pa was in my plan, but during the weather research I decide to skip it.Thanks a lot!!!"
"Marble Moutain is wonderful : beautiful panorama of the region, pagodas ans temples, including in grottoes and, at the bottom of the mountain, marble and other stone sculptors. definitely worth a visit IF you are interested by Culture (count one hour) You can take a taxi from Danang Airport and ask the driver to stop there ; since most Occidentals who arrive in Danang go to Hoi An, do like me, ask some people if they want to share the ride while waiting for your luggage ; never missed !"
"""....definitely worth a visit IF you are interested by Culture....""Culture, Jack?Or religion?Pretty sure there's a difference. Scott"
"Pretty sure you do not know what you are talking about. For each clan, tribe or nationality, CULTURE is composed o different elements including language, writing, history, habitat, clothing, food, RELIGION, habits and custom, so, I alm orrect and you are wrong, Skotty000 !"
"In the list, I forgot ARTS, which include among many other elements architecture and decoration (statues, inscriptions, etc.) , meaning that temples and pagodas are included under THREE cultural aspects : History, , architectural/decoration and religionEdited: 1:49 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Well why not just say religion, Jock?Perhaps you could be more specific in future. ;-)Scott"
"Can't you READ ? Marble Mountain includes more elements than just ""religion"" ! Therefore, my word ""Culture"" is correct and you are a real pain, but what else is new with you ???? I am afraid that the JOCK is you, according to the following definition :In the United States and Canada, a jock is a stereotype of an athlete, or someone who is primarily interested in sports and sports culture, and does not take much interest in intellectual culture.Edited: 4:45 am, April 25, 2020 "
I would give Marble Mountain a miss. It is not impressive and is just another man made construct with little natural appeal. If you want a panorama of this part of the coast I would have a look at re-routing on the way to Hoi An to travel around Son Tra.Cheers Ross
"There are 3 tops from which one has a superb panorama of the region : Marble Mountain, Son Tra Peninsula and Pass of the Clouds, the latter offering 2 panoramas, south over Danang and north over the coastline up to Lung Cu (which explains why I always recommend to got from Hue to Danang or vice-versa by car going up the Pass, not through the tunnel."
"The Marble Mountains was designated a Special National Monumnent under the Scenic Category.It does encompass culture (Cham relics) and the concept of the Five Elements in Oriental Culture.Stone statue carving is also a cultural thing.In the field of archeology, the mountains were islands before they became land. The distinct natural colors of the soil and stones at the various (small) mountains also present an interesting aspect. So does the fact that the area was once occupied by the Cham people.Cheers,John"
"'Religion', 'culture', whatever you want to call it, l just found the whole thing underwhelming. Nice view; mostly of ugly resorts; but little else. Time better spent elsewhere. ;-)ScottEdited: 7:44 am, April 26, 2020 "
The construction of a lift to get to see the natural and cultural aspects of Marble Mountains is a desecration of this historic site in my opinion. Coupled with the hustling by the local stone masons keeps me from returning.Cheers Ross
"""Coupled with the hustling by the local stone masons keeps me from returning.""Have some friends that got absolutely taken to the cleaners by a scamming stone mason there.They will never return to Vietnam because of it.All very sad.Scott"
"I used not to like lifts and cable cars, but then I started thinking about the seniors... And then I'm getting there as well, myself. You can always use the steps from either end. It's a good trek if you take in the entire north-south length.As for scammers, just don't buy anything if you don't like the price... or just don't buy anything at all.John"
